HULKING MAMMALS AND HIGH TECHNOLOGY ARE JUST THE BEGINNING; A WHALE OF A 
FESTIVAL

<P>
 For the second year running, the information superhighway will take a 
temporary detour through the Dana Point Festival of Whales, giving event-goers 
a chance to link up electronically with a scientist working in another part of 
the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 At last year's festival, researchers working in Biosphere 2 conversed via 
video teleconferences with students and other visitors. The Arizona project, 
which ended last year, had put a team of scientists in a sealed, self-contained 
microcosm of Earth for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, opening day for this year's festival, the Cousteau Society sponsors 
a program at Dana Hills High School in which participants will be able to ask 
questions of geophysicist Robert Ballard as he works on a project in Belize, 
Central America. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Friday's program, Peter Burtchell of the Cousteau Society will talk 
about "Threats to Our Global Oceans." Ballard's video satellite hookups will 
continue during the week, as he tells students and other festival-goers about 
the Jason Project, an ongoing science program set this year in Belize. Ballard 
is probably most famous for his discovery of the sunken ocean liner Titanic. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ballard teleconferences are just one aspect of the festival, which 
continues to expand every year. Also offered will be programs set aboard the 
sailing ship Pilgrim at the Orange County Marine Institute, sand sculpture 
workshops and a contest, children's events and activities, a symphony concert, 
tide-pool tours, a parade, a "Street Faire" and an appearance by popular marine 
life painter Wyland. 
</P>
<P>
 There are athletic contests as well, including a quick but grueling bike climb 
up Cove Road from the harbor, a long board surfing contest, a 5K run, a 
volleyball tournament and a sea kayaking clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, there are whales -- Pacific gray whales migrating just beyond 
the Dana Point Headlands as they make their way south to breeding grounds along 
the coast of Mexico. This is being called a particularly strong whale season, 
with multiple sightings on almost every trip out of Dana Point. Whale-watch 
excursions are offered by Dana Wharf Sportfishing and by the Marine Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Whale-watching provided the original impetus for the festival, which began in 
1972, but in recent years it has gained a broader focus. 
</P>
<P>
 "When (the festival) first started, it was an educational program only, 
offered through the schools," said Jody Tyson, executive director of the Dana 
Point Chamber of Commerce, sponsors of the event for the past several years. 
"Every year, hopefully, it gets bigger and better. This should be our biggest 
so far." 
</P>
<P>
 The festival has grown from being a celebration of the whale to showcasing the 
entire marine environment. Even with nature documentaries and books, Tyson 
said, there is no better way to learn and appreciate than to experience the 
environment firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they have a chance to come down here to walk through the tide pools, to 
touch an anchovy, to see a gull or just smell the salt air, it can really come 
alive," Tyson said. 
</P>
<P>
 As in past years, the Orange County Marine Institute in Dana Point Harbor will 
be a center of activity, with tide-pool tours and other programs about marine 
life, whale-watch excursions, and programs aboard the brig Pilgrim, a sailing 
ship outfitted like those of the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Arts of the Sailor" will give visitors a chance to "learn what it was 
like to be a sailor back in the days of the sailing ships," said Dan Stetson, 
associate executive director of the institute. "We want to show what it was 
like to be in the whaling industry in those days and contrast it to what (it's) 
like today." 
</P>
<P>
 The marine institute is also involved in the Jason Project, a national effort 
now in its fifth year "to improve student interest in science," said Stan 
Cummings, executive director of the institute. Every year, students at about 30 
locations in the United States and Canada are hooked up via satellite with 
scientists working in some part of the globe. This year, the two-week project 
happens to fall during the Festival of Whales, so the satellite sessions will 
also be open to the general public. 
</P>
<P>
 Selected students and other audience members will be able to ask questions of 
Ballard and even operate remote cameras. Ballard's main specialty has been 
mapping the ocean floor; the program will focus on both the rain forest and on 
the coral reefs off Belize, the largest reef system in the Western Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
 In Dana Point at the Edwards Ocean Ranch Village cinema, the program will be 
held Monday through Saturday, Feb. 28, to March 5 and March 7 through 12, four 
times daily: 8:30, 10 and 11:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. Some seats will be set aside 
for the public at each showing, particularly on Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond its educational facets, there are some down-home community aspects of 
the Festival of Whales as well, such as Saturday's opening parade, a one-mile 
line of local marching bands and waving politicians that will end at La Plaza 
Park, site of the street fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little hometown parade," Tyson said. "It gets the entire community 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 The street fair, which will continue for both weekends of the festival, will 
include more than 100 booths featuring food and crafts, in addition to a 
petting zoo. Musical entertainment will range from Big Band to surf rock.

COMEDY; ENGVALL, DRAWN TO O.C., IS ALSO BIG DRAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN DOGGRELL, Glenn Doggrell writes about comedy for The Times Orange 
County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Engvall must have seen something he likes in Orange County. He's back. 
</P>
<P>
 A benefit at the Bren Events Center in October, a special engagement at the 
Irvine Improv in November, four shows at the Brea Improv in December, and now 
another special engagement in Brea this week and next. (A special engagement 
just means you're going to have to pay a little more, and no passes will be 
accepted.) 
</P>
<P>
 Also in town are Rocky LaPorte at the Irvine Improv, Denny Johnston at 
Centerfield Sports Bar & Grill in Huntington Beach and Mark Britten at Standing 
Room Only in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Engvall's a good draw here," said Brea's Mike Manzo, the club's media 
relations manager. "And he's working on a new type of format to his act. He's 
adding a backdrop and doing an hour and 10 instead of 50 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 The Texas-born, drawling comedian is perhaps best known for his bit on stupid 
people and stupid stuff, which includes an observation on the warning on 
dry-cleaning bags: "This is not a toy." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't count the number of kids sitting on Santa's lap, saying, 'No, 
Santa, I don't want a bike or a train. Just a big old clear cleaning bag will 
do me fine.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But the 36-year-old comic's act goes well beyond that. Giving voice to pets' 
and animals' thoughts is another Engvall forte, including his dog's hang-dog 
response after being neutered: "Bill, how could you do this to me?" 
</P>
<P>
 The ACE winner for best male stand-up in 1991 is also a master of putting 
together a seamless show, going effortlessly from topic to topic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I classify myself this way," he said. "If you're on the highway, I'm that 
stripe in the middle of the road. It's always there, and it don't ever vary." 
</P>
<P>
 He was a regular on the TV series "Delta" and a guest on "Designing Women" and 
has performed on "The Tonight Show" as well as just about every other comedy 
show on the small screen. 
</P>
<P>
 In his club shows, Engvall prefers the story-weaving approach to rapid-fire 
punch lines, and he punctuates his routine with laughter, as if he's hearing 
the anecdote for the first time too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy every minute of being on stage," he once told The Times. "There's 
nothing better than the feeling when you're in tune with an audience." 
</P>
<P>
 LaPorte, who will be in Irvine, hasn't quite reached Engvall's level, but he 
can out-brag Engvall when it comes to number of times shot.  
</P>
<P>
 On this point, the Brooklyn-born LaPorte can make a good case for being a 
unique comic and get little argument. He has been shot three times, in three 
different incidents. (He has also been stabbed twice.) The third shot cut short 
a promising boxing career in Chicago, where he was driving 18-wheelers around 
town and across country while pulling over now and then to jot down funny 
thoughts on boxing, trucking and being from the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
 After collecting enough of these, he tried an open-mike night, launching his 
new career. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past few years, LaPorte, who says he would some day like to write an 
etiquette book, has refined those thoughts into stories, which he delivers like 
(surprise) a trucker with a Bronx accent -- kind of like a Sylvester Stallone 
trying to make you laugh. He performs through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 At Huntington Beach's Centerfield Sports Bar on Tuesday night, Johnston -- a 
veteran of "The Tonight Show," "Late Night With David Letterman" and "Arsenio" 
-- is headlining a bill that also features Rob Breckenridge. Johnston's other 
credits include opening for Michael Bolton and Julio Iglesias, appearing on 
several cable specials and starring in clubs throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fullerton, Standing Room Only is featuring Britten, a comic known for his 
impersonations and musical forays. He has appeared on "An Evening at the 
Improv" and Comedy Central's "Short Attention Span Theater" and headlined from 
Honolulu to Hollywood, Minneapolis to Miami. He's there through Sunday.

WANNA DANCE?: YOUNGER SET GIVES CLUB DIMENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

to The Times Orange County Edition.

<P>
 Despite the number of 18- to 20-year-olds dying to enter the nightclub scene 
and willing to pay just about any cover charge to do so, few clubs are willing 
to go after this audience. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason is pure bottom line: sodas generate less profit than alcoholic 
drinks. Another reason is that many older patrons don't particularly like 
hanging with someone fresh out of high school. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are advantages: An otherwise dismal evening can turn explosive when 
the doors are opened to an 18-and-over set with the energy to party all night. 
That theory is proved Thursday nights at Club Dimensions in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosted by promoters Positive Image, the club is, for better or worse, unlike 
anything in the county. After paying the $6 cover charge and flashing an ID 
(which determines whether they get one of the fluorescent bracelets marking 
those of legal drinking age), patrons head into one of two rooms according to 
whichever booming beat pulls them. 
</P>
<P>
 In the larger one, deejays Juan Smooth, Jose Rhythm and Carlos entertain a 
packed floor with deep house, techno and an occasional KROQ ditty -- usually of 
the Soft Cell variety. The hypnotic clamor keeps the predominantly Latino crowd 
in a perpetual bouncing state, hips swaying, legs kicking and arms moving, 
reminiscent of quebradita . It beats anything Jane Fonda or Cindy Crawford can 
come up with for a cardiovascular workout. 
</P>
<P>
 The banquet room-like chairs and tables (covered with tablecloths) and the 
faux foliage and flowers in box planters lining the walls give the scene an 
effect of a family party crashed by trendy teens. But wallflowers only need 
look at the frenzy on the dance floor and stage (which is taken over by video 
vixens-in-training), the colored strobes and the 8- millimeter art films 
lighting the walls to get in the mood. 
</P>
<P>
 Dollar drink specials (last week it was bourbon and cola) change hands across 
the long marble-top bar, which stretches between both rooms. The bar stays 
stocked throughout the night with young dudes checking out the steady parade of 
patrons, hoping to make eye contact with some vision in black -- the color of 
choice among the women with big hair. 
</P>
<P>
 A passageway leads to a smaller room pumping retro, old school and hip-hop 
courtesy of deejays Ice Man and Tony Wild. In this room, the bodies groove 
closer together and more in sync on the limited dance floor. The interior wins 
the prize for looking like a club in a bad TV sitcom, with geometrical mirrors 
covering the walls and glass blocks piled carefully on shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 Flyers boast an upstairs VIP lounge filled with pool tables, but it remained 
locked last week. Tip: There are restrooms up there outside the room that 
apparently few patrons know about. There are another pair of restrooms 
downstairs in the smaller dance room. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thursday-eve gig averages about 500 patrons weekly, according to 
promoters, 300 shy of maximum capacity. 
</P>
<P>

(714) 758-7734 or (213) 726-3825. * Thursdays only, 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. Open to

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK: NRBQ, "MESSAGE FOR THE MESS AGE"; FORWARD/RHINO  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If there was a "lost groove" akin to the mythical lost chord, one in such 
perfect harmony with the universe that it conveys instant enlightenment upon 
anyone who hears it, NRBQ would be the best bet to find it. Time after time the 
veteran quartet -- "virtuosos of fun," as Robert Christgau once described its 
members -- crafts pop masterpieces of such enticing rhythm and infectious 
melody that they seem to have a special pipeline to the heart of the musical 
cosmos.The band's first studio album in five years is no exception. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening track, "Over Your Head," lopes out of the starting gate on the 
liquid rhythmic foundation provided by drummer Tom Ardolino and bassist Joey 
Spampinato. It's so irresistible you find yourself smiling even as Adams sings 
its message about the myriad ways excess gets the human race into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Guitarist Al Anderson continues to be one of the musical wonders of the world, 
both in his playing and songwriting. While he has the chops to cut the best 
rock or jazz players, he understands that there's no need to play 1,000 notes 
when one, well chosen, will suffice. Check out the Beatle-esque charm of his 
""Nothin' Wrong With Me."  
</P>
<P>
 As always, keyboardist-singer-songwriter Terry Adams is the wild card. Here, 
he turns in a plea to be his loved one's "Designated Driver" and an ode to his 
longtime band-mate, "Spampinato." That number is less ingratiating than their 
similarly self-reflective "Here Comes Terry" tribute years ago, and if overall 
the album lacks the seamless wonder of its predecessor, "Wild Weekend," it's 
only because the band's laudable willingness to experiment inevitably produces 
some failures. RANDY LEWIS

CLASSIC OF THE WEEK: RICHARD THOMPSON, "HAND OF KINDNESS" (1983); 
HANNIBAL/RYKODISC  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Hand of Kindness" had the misfortune of being Richard Thompson's follow-up to 
"Shoot Out the Lights," the album he recorded in 1982 with his then-wife and 
musical partner, Linda Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 An inspired work that mirrored in strikingly honest terms the couple's 
deteriorating marriage, "Shoot Out the Lights" ranks as one of rock's all time 
great albums.But even though the more modest "Hand of Kindness" doesn't possess 
its predecessor's inherent drama, it remains a wonderfully eclectic, enduring 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Making his first record on his own since 1972, Thompson opted to spread his 
wings by amalgamating some vastly different musical textures. "Hand of 
Kindness" utilizes accordions, horns and upbeat Celtic rhythms as well as more 
traditional rock and folk elements. Such tracks as "Where the Wind Don't Whine" 
and "Both Ends Burning" bring to mind some of Van Morrison's early work in 
their ability to fuse various musical ingredients into something highly 
original. The album also features several straightforward Celtic numbers, 
including the playful and danceable "Two Left Feet." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most emotionally compelling moments on "Hand of Kindness" arrive 
in the form of two ballads. The title track slithers forward with the help of 
Thompson's twangy, arcane electric guitar figures. "Devonside" is another 
guitar-based song with some appealingly sweet and melancholy characteristics. 
Lyrically, the album finds Thompson both reflecting back on his failed marriage 
and looking forward to new love. JON MATSUMOTO

KID STUFF: MINDING MANNERS; ETIQUETTE FOR 'LITTLE LORDS AND LADIES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, Corinne Flocken is a free-lance writer who regularly covers 
Kid Stuff for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Flocken's Wild Parenting Theory 203: All parents -- even those who attend 
Grateful Dead concerts en famille and name their kids after herbal teas 
(Morning Mist! Sweet Spearmint! Breakfast Is Ready!) -- secretly crave such 
children as Jane and Michael Banks, the strait-laced, impeccably mannered 
siblings in "Mary Poppins." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, laugh. But if we were really going to be honest with ourselves, we'd 
probably find a little George Banks in all of us, desirous of children who can 
exchange pleasantries with our bosses, correctly use three or more types of 
flatware and summon us to the phone without bellowing like a cow in labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Neal Peebles thinks so, too. The founder and owner of the Victorian 
Tea Co. in Long Beach will be in Costa Mesa this weekend to present "Little 
Lords and Ladies," a 2 1/2-hour etiquette workshop for children age 7 to 12. 
Sponsored by Orange Coast College, the class, which is the first of its kind at 
OCC, meets Saturday in the school's home economics building. A parent-and-child 
tea party is included with the registration fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Etiquette class? Your children? It is to laugh, right? 
</P>
<P>
 The idea isn't as far-fetched as it seems, Peebles insists. Though her 
workshop touches on topics ranging from how to write a thank-you note to how to 
conduct oneself at afternoon tea, Peebles says the bottom line is friendliness, 
not stuffiness. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want children to realize that etiquette is really just the ability to make 
someone else feel comfortable," said Peebles, "and to make themselves feel 
comfortable in social situations." 
</P>
<P>
 Peebles has made a career out of being genteel. The daughter of Canadian-born 
parents, she grew up in a Midwest home where taking afternoon tea and cotillion 
classes was perfectly normal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were kind of an anachronism in our neighborhood," she recalled with a 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 A former music teacher, she once served as "officer of protocol" for a 
professional women's organization in Winnipeg, where she also learned the exact 
science of military protocol from her cousin, an officer in the Royal Canadian 
Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
 Peebles married and moved to Southern California and in 1987 started Victorian 
Tea Co., a small business housed in a restored Victorian in downtown Long Beach 
that offers classes, catering and teas and other services, including a class in 
business etiquette for a Long Beach firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, her reputation as a local Miss Manners has spread, as evidenced by 
a recent phone call from a private Newport Beach club. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a big debate among the members about whether women needed to remove 
their golf caps when they came in the lounge, like the men did," she recalled. 
Naturally, Pebbles set them straight. Of course they are. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Little Lords and Ladies" class was started at the request of her clients 
and has been in demand at Cal State Long Beach for seven semesters, where the 
boy/girl ratio is roughly 40/60, Peebles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though she admits that "my mom made me" is the No. 1 reason most children give 
for being in her class, she says almost all of them end up having a good time 
in spite of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is to keep it simple and fun," she explained. "We do something called 
'Sidewalk Cake Walk' in which we get them walking around the room in pairs in a 
pretend city, keeping the gentleman on the outside, and they learn how to keep 
that up . . . without tripping over each other's feet." 
</P>
<P>
 Games and role-playing also help teach telephone manners, conversational 
skills and appropriate behavior in a restaurant, said Peebles, who liberally 
dispenses stickers and other goodies as incentives. At the end of class, 
students reward themselves and show off their newfound skills at a tea party, 
complete with tea (heavily sugared, if requested) and sandwiches served on fine 
china. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother of a 4-year-old, Peebles admits that while a little polish can do 
wonders for a child's self-esteem, if the going gets tough, good manners may 
not always save your neck on the schoolyard. But they can be of some benefit.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is about interacting with people . . . but we don't get into behavioral 
psychology here," she said. "But, like I tell my daughter, it helps to know how 
to use your words, to talk to them, try to work it out, and if it doesn't, to 
walk away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, I think it all comes down to kindness," she continued. "If you put 
it out, it will come back. Maybe not immediately, but it will come back to you. 
That's my belief."

WET & WILD; ENVIRONMENTALISTS TAKE DIVE TO HELP CLEAN UP AVALON BAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDAN, David Haldane is a member of The Times Orange County Edition 
staff. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lots of interesting things have been hauled up from the depths of Avalon Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been kitchen sinks, toilets, radios, sunglasses, tools, fishing 
poles, video cameras, boomboxes and the underwear of both sexes. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman found a diamond bracelet worth several hundred dollars, which, after 
unsuccessfully attempting to locate the owner, she got to keep. Another diver 
gleaned an eight-track tape of Johnny Mathis. And yet another retrieved a used 
condom from the sandy bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, experts say, about 4,000 to 6,000 pounds of trash come up from these 
crystalline waters one day each year, largely due to the efforts of hundreds of 
visiting divers. 
</P>
<P>
 That day comes around Saturday as the expected swarm of amateur underwater 
environmentalists once again prepares to converge on Catalina Island for the 
annual underwater bay cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a way for divers to give back to the sport that they love," says Randy 
Brannock, co-owner of Catalina Diver's Supply, the Avalon dive shop that 
organizes the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a way to keep the environment clean of debris and pick up trash 
that's been contributed by Homo sapiens." 
</P>
<P>
 It's also the only day of the year on which diving is permitted in Avalon Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual underwater cleanup began 14 years ago as a low-key attempt by a 
handful of local divers to help keep the bay clean. 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually the event gained in popularity, Brannock said, until this weekend, 
when he expects as many as 350 certified scuba divers -- almost all from the 
mainland -- to pay $18 apiece for the privilege of making two dives from the 
beach (with free air fills) to depths of 50 feet between 10:30 a.m. and 2:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, it's just a bunch of crazy people coming over here to have a good 
time and help clean up our bay too," Brannock said. "They pay their own way, 
and they make a donation. We can't say enough good about them." 
</P>
<P>
 All major cruise lines, which generally transport people to Catalina for $25 
to $35 for a round trip, will be offering Saturday discounts to cleanup 
participants. And those wishing to spend the weekend will also find discounts 
at many local hotels. (For more information about this and the dive, call (310) 
510-0330.) 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the proceeds from the underwater cleanup -- which last year raised 
about $1,200 despite a major storm -- will be donated to Catalina Conservancy 
Divers, an ecology-oriented dive club dedicated to helping conserve the marine 
environment through abalone restoration, kelp-forest monitoring and research 
diving.  
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the money will go to the Catalina Hyperbaric Chamber, a 
recompression chamber operated by USC at the island's Wrigley Marine Lab, which 
has saved many a careless diver from death by the bends. 
</P>
<P>
 But the event won't be just work, work, work. 
</P>
<P>
 To make things interesting, the organizers will give away diving gear as door 
prizes and raffle off several donated Catalina vacation packages. 
</P>
<P>
 And to show their appreciation for the effort, sponsors will award 
participants with symbolic pine plaques in the shape of trash cans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pretty much make them up as we go," Brannock said. "The judges are the 
dive operators, and we accept bribes." 
</P>
<P>
 Among last year's favorites: an award for the most valuable catch, taken home 
by the finder of the diamond bracelet; one for the most worthless find, earned 
by the man who picked up the Mathis tape, and an award for social conscience 
went to the condom retriever. 
</P>
<P>
 The golden flipper award for the day's outstanding performance was taken by a 
buddy team that freed a horn shark tangled in fishing line. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Ken Curtis BS Award, given, according to Brannock, to "whoever can 
tell the greatest story about their underwater adventure during the cleanup" 
went to the diver who announced that he had found Noah's ark. 
</P>
<P>
 The award -- consisting of a plaque with a buffalo chip spray-painted on it -- 
is named after Ken Curtis, a local dive operator. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the one who gave us the idea when he brought up Elvis Presley's sweat 
shirt," Brannock recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said that he'd just certified Elvis."

STEP RIGHT IN TO FOLK DANCING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Zan Dubin's otherwise excellent article on folk dancing (cover story, Feb. 10) 
could needlessly discourage new folks from joining in, for two reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 First, don't stay away because you have nothing to wear. At least with 
international folk dancing, adequate attire is a T-shirt and slacks for most 
events. Don't let the photos give you pause. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, your eyes are not likely to glaze over. Anyone with a reasonable 
measure of coordination and presence of mind will do just fine. 
</P>
<P>
 The only advisable optional equipment is a sense of humor.

DO IT!: AUDUBON TREK ISN'T JUST FOR THE BIRDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Rick VanderKnyff is a free-lance writer who regularly 
contributes to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A chance to trek through the San Jacinto Wildlife Area -- with its mosaic of 
habitats that makes it attractive to a variety of birds and other animals -- is 
being offered Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 South Coast Audubon, one of two Orange County chapters of the National Audubon 
Society, will lead a trip to the Riverside County preserve, which encompasses 
almost 5,000 acres, including wetlands areas in the process of restoration and 
rolling hills with grasslands and pristine coastal sage scrub areas. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 160 bird species have been counted in a single day, boasting the 
highest totals of any Audubon inland bird count. Overall, 240 different bird 
species have been seen at the preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Winter is a particularly good time for birding because of the populations of 
wintering water fowl and raptors, including bald eagles, that can be seen 
there. But that's not all.  
</P>
<P>
 "We should see a lot more than birds out there," said trip coordinator Judi 
Vrana. Seen at the preserve, along with the birds, have been 38 mammal species, 
32 reptile species and seven amphibian species. 
</P>
<P>
 The endangered Stephen's kangaroo rat is one of the mammals that makes its 
home in the park. Burrows can be seen throughout dirt roads and fields, but 
because the rodent is nocturnal, none are likely to be seen during the morning 
walk. Another creature living in holes in the ground is the burrowing owl, once 
common to Orange County but now all but driven out by development. 
</P>
<P>
 Also rating high marks is the scenery, with spectacular views of snow-capped 
San Jacinto and San Gorgonio peaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The preserve is a regular destination for South Coast Audubon, and beginning 
birders are welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of non-advanced birders in our group," Vrana said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reservations for the guided walk are not required. It is recommended that 
participants wear sturdy walking shoes, dress warmly and take water, lunch, 
binoculars and a bird field guide. The walk will start at 8 a.m. and will end 
around noon with a group lunch. Participants can stay on through the afternoon 
for self-guided walks. 
</P>
<P>
 One caution: Rain in the days before the trip could force a rescheduling. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What: South Coast Audubon field trip to San Jacinto Wildlife Area. When: 
Saturday, Feb. 26, at 8 a.m. Where: San Jacinto Wildlife Area, Riverside 
County. Whereabouts: Take the Riverside (91) Freeway east to Riverside, then 
head east on the Pomona (60) Freeway. Exit at Theodore Street and go south; 
when the paved road turns, continue straight on the dirt road to the preserve 
gates, about 3 1/2 miles. Wherewithal: Park entry is $2.50 per person. Where to 
call: Judi Vrana, (714) 582-1776.

LEAPIN' LIZARDS!; SPINY IGUANA MAKES A COOL (BLOODED) PET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, Benjamin Epstein is a free-lance writer who regularly 
contributes to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You love dinosaurs. But having seen "Jurassic Park," you know that owning the 
real thing means running the risk that it's going to paralyze you with its 
saliva, then eat you. 
</P>
<P>
 A viable alternative: Own an iguana. They're smaller than dinosaurs, they're 
vegetarians, and they generally like you better than they do each other. If you 
want to find out if you like them, go meet Kiwana, a 5 1/2-foot iguana with 
free run of Ben's Plants and Pets in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kiwana's loose at all times," store owner Ben Wright said. "She's a real 
sun-worshiper, so during the day she lies out in front of the store on a row of 
raised bricks. Nobody has to watch her; she's not on a leash. At night she's on 
top of a cockatoo cage, but never inside of a cage." 
</P>
<P>
 The iguana sold in pet stores is found from Mexico to Brazil and can range 
from green to gray in color. It has a large dewlap and a crest of scales down 
the back and tail. Wright likened the iguana's personality to that of a more 
common house pet, and cited his breeding pair, Cisco and Lizard Girl, as 
examples. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're very dog-like in personality, very personable," Wright noted. "They 
come up for affection; they like to be close, and they're very calm. Iguanas 
can also be housebroken. I had two that used to scratch at the door, go outside 
to go to the bathroom and scratch to get back in. I fed them in a dog dish." 
</P>
<P>
 To iguana owners' delight, they're even more long-lived than dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was small, and it was small, I gave one to a friend," Wright recalled. 
"Now it's pushing six feet, and he's had it for almost 27 years!" Iguanas can 
live for 30 years, but six feet indeed seems to be the limit; they grow an inch 
a month, or about a foot a year. 
</P>
<P>
 It's unusual that Cisco and Lizard Girl get along so well, and Ben recommends 
owning one lizard rather than two. His large male, Bubba, exhibits more common 
behavior, immediately becoming aggressive when let out with Kiwana. 
</P>
<P>
 With good adult supervision, a 6- or 7-year-old can make a good iguana owner, 
according to Wright, and there is no upper age limit: "The senior citizens who 
come in the store get quite a kick out of them."  
</P>
<P>
 Cost for the reptiles can be very reasonable; at Ben's, and at Prehistoric 
Pets in nearby Fountain Valley, they start at $19.99, although they can reach 
up to more than $1,000 for larger ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Kiwana, younger iguanas require a cage. Proper lighting, heat and 
humidity are essential to iguana health, and a common problem is that the 
little ones get away. Pets should be kept in a terrarium until they're at least 
two feet long. Wright carries a variety of tanks from 10 to 60 gallons as well 
as several types of lighting facilities, and, of course, "The Green Iguana 
Manual."  
</P>
<P>
 Health considerations for owners are also important; commenting on recent 
reports that contact with iguanas as well as snakes, frogs, turtles and other 
reptiles can cause salmonella, Wright said: "That's basic hygiene. You need to 
wash your hands after handling any reptile." 
</P>
<P>
 The initial investment, from $150 to $200, can be considerable, but upkeep 
thereafter is minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright offers a frozen fruit and vegetable diet chock-full of iguana vitamins 
at $6.99 for eight ounces, which can last a baby iguana over a month. "The 
leafy green stuff is not enough," he said. "The professional formulations are 
better." Owners can supplement with cantaloupe, bananas, yellow squash and 
broccoli; iguanas can also eat flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Accessories allow even young iguanas to get out of their cages some of the 
time. "We sell harnesses so you can take them out for a walk," Wright said. 
"People used to walk in with birds on their shoulders. Now they walk in with 
iguanas."

REWIND: MANIC COMIC ROBIN WILLIAMS GOES OVER THE TOP IN 'LIVE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Everybody's doing cocaine," observes Robin Williams. "Baseball players have 
to go in front of a grand jury and say, 'Yeah, I did cocaine, but can you blame 
me? It's a goddamn slow game! Come on, Jack! I'm standing out in left field for 
seven innings and there's a white line going down to home plate!" 
</P>
<P>
 During "Robin Williams Live" -- a video presentation of his 1986 HBO comedy 
concert -- Williams spits out one hilarious joke after another like a seasoned 
poker dealer rifling out cards at a Las Vegas casino. At times the words come 
tumbling out of his mouth so fast that even an alert viewer may feel compelled 
to keep a finger on the rewind button. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams isn't the type of laid-back comedian who is simply going to hold a 
microphone and recite jokes. With a face bursting with animation and limbs that 
never seem to stop, this manic performer puts his entire body into his stand-up 
routines. On stage Williams isn't just a comedian, he's also a hip, modern-day 
clown and an impressionist who imitates everyone from Moammar Kadafi to Jerry 
Falwell. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' hyperactive persona and over-the-top imitations help bring an 
undeniable silliness to "Robin Williams Live." Yet the humor here often 
reflects an underlying social concern and a keen understanding of the world as 
it was in 1986. His observations regarding such issues as the nuclear arms race 
and U.S. intervention in Nicaragua also serve to remind us how much the global 
political landscape has changed in the past seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, most of "Robin Williams Live" is very applicable today. In regard to 
the proliferation of guns in America, Williams cracks: "Everybody here knows 
we're armed and it's escalating. It's going to get to the point when we're 
going to come home one day and people across the street will be going, 'I've 
built a cruise missile to stop those kids from playing ZZ Top!' " 
</P>
<P>
 The most memorable segment of "Robin Williams Live" arrives when our 
irrepressible host gives us a knowing and uncensored look at sex, childbirth 
and parenthood. "(You dream) about your kid," says Williams. "Dreams that one 
day your kid will be up there going, 'I'd like to thank the Nobel Academy.' 
Then you have this other dream where your kid's going, 'Would you like fries 
with this?' You don't know. It's a crapshoot." 
</P>
<P>
 Stand-up comedy doesn't get much better than this. 
</P>
<P>
 "Robin Williams Live" (1986), directed by Bruce Gowers. 65 minutes. Rated R.

SPECIAL SCREENING: WELLES GIVES HIS FILM NOIR JUST THE RIGHT TOUCH OF 'EVIL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lancer who regularly writes 
about film for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you've never seen "Touch of Evil," be ready for a jolt. The Orson Welles 
that many remember, the baby-faced, youthful fellow from "Citizen Kane" is no 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1958 movie (17 years after "Citizen Kane"), Welles has settled into his 
fat era. Like Elvis, he's let himself expand and expand, but Welles uses the 
bulk perfectly in "Touch of Evil," which screens Friday night at the Newport 
Harbor Art Museum in a retrospective of the filmmaker's career. 
</P>
<P>
 As Hank Quinlan, the creepy cop at the dingy center of "Touch of Evil," Welles 
looks ready to explode with venom. He's a huge, sweaty balloon primed to pop, 
filling the movie with stinking air. In short, he's great, the ideal creation 
for a superbly vile example of film noir. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture, which shocked most audiences because of its trashy plot and 
gutter stylizations when first released, has since become a cult darling. Some 
say that, in its own shameless way, "Touch of Evil" is as impressive as 
"Citizen Kane." That's a crazy reach, but it is captivating, and remarkably 
effective at creating a mood of pervading corruption. Besides, "Touch of Evil" 
is one of the most amusing movies Welles ever made. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of his cinematic impulses here are striking, both for their audacity and 
humor. The dialogue Welles wrote for Quinlan is all spit and spite; he's 
unnerving, but you laugh because he's so comfortable with being a sleaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's what Welles has done to poor Charlton Heston. This stalwart 
matinee idol still plays the hero, Vargas, a good detective from Mexico, but 
Welles inflicts dark face makeup, a black hair-dye job and a gigolo's worm-thin 
mustache on him. 
</P>
<P>
 For more fun, we have Janet Leigh playing Heston's bombshell of a wife, Susie. 
She's spunky in her bosom-gripping sweaters, talking back to the bad guys up to 
the moment she's drugged and lying naked on a "reefer" strewn bed in a rancid 
hotel room as part of a frame-up by Quinlan. Also, take a long look at Dennis 
Weaver as a rattled motel manager; he was doing gonzo Dennis Hopper way before 
Dennis Hopper. 
</P>
<P>
 But before all that, Quinlan and Vargas begin their faceoff in the border town 
of Los Robles (which is actually Los Angeles' Venice, filmed during much 
seedier days). Vargas witnesses a car bombing murder while walking with Susie 
and decides to investigate on his own, a move that riles Quinlan, who's 
handling the case on the U.S. side and doesn't like interference from anyone 
who "speaks Mexican." By the time Vargas discovers that Quinlan has a habit of 
planting evidence on suspected criminals, the two are hardened enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 The film is more expressionistic and crude than "The Lady From Shanghai," 
Welles' 1948 film noir that screened at the museum last week. Welles keeps 
everything purposely rough -- most scenes are at night, lit only by gaudy 
street lamps, and he uses hip-hopping, nightmarish camera angles and rabid 
music (lots of bongos) for atmosphere. The whole movie looks decayed, and that 
suits the pulp story line. 
</P>
<P>
 It's actually remarkable that Welles was able to make the picture in the first 
place.  
</P>
<P>
 Labeled a maverick troublemaker, Welles had been pushed out of Hollywood in 
the late '40s and early '50s and was given the "Touch of Evil" job by Universal 
after nearly a decade away from America. Studio bosses reasoned that if he was 
willing to do a budget-minded B-movie, they were willing to take a chance on 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with money constraints, he let his individualist's instincts take over. 
He also got a little help from his friends; both Joseph Cotten, one of the 
stars of "Citizen Kane" and "The Magnificent Ambersons," and Marlene Dietrich, 
a longtime pal, took bit parts in "Touch of Evil" to give it a dose of star 
power. 
</P>

KIDS ON FILM: 'BLUE CHIPS' CASHES IN ON SPORTS AND THE SLAM POWER OF SHAQ 
O'NEAL

 In "Blue Chips," a passionate and idealistic college basketball coach (Nick 
Nolte) experiences his first losing season, succumbs to bribing new recruits 
(including NBA star Shaquille O'Neal) for the next season, but discovers the 
emptiness of a victory reached through cheating. (Rated PG-13)  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Young star-struck sports fans, wearing their backward baseball caps and 
X-Large T-shirts, came to this movie for two reasons and two reasons only: 
sports and stars.  
</P>
<P>
 They were only mildly disappointed. The problems? Too much boring story. Not 
enough detail in the basketball scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was OK, but it was boring in the middle," said Jason Poulos, 10. "He just 
walks around talking to his wife," he said speaking of Nolte. "It needed more 
playing time." Moreover, he complained, "The camera too much moved around. You 
couldn't follow the ball that much." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Howard, 12, said the camera motion made him dizzy. Even so, he saw the 
movie twice in three days. 
</P>
<P>
 For most, under-the-table recruiting was a new concept. But clearly, the kids 
did not fall for the film's conventional moral that this kind of recruiting is 
wrong, or as Nolte tells his players in the end: "The rules don't make much 
sense, but I believe in the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they seemed to buy the argument of the sleazy suit who represented 
the wealthy alumni supporters of the bribery program: i.e., these talented 
athletes make a lot of money for the school, yet they get nothing in return, so 
why not give them something?  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see why they shouldn't buy them," said Sean Mulvaney, 10. College 
basketball, he reasoned, is just like the NBA. "They're learning new things and 
making money for the colleges." 
</P>
<P>
 Added his friend Jason: "Why not give some to the players? They do it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, it was wrong for Nolte to break the rules, but the rules are stupid. So, 
Jason said, "They should change the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 In the movie, one player gets $30,000 cash in a sports bag plus a new tractor 
for his farmer father to sign a letter of intent to play for the fictional 
Western University. Another gets a suburban home for his inner-city mother and 
her other children. O'Neal is offered the keys to a Lexus but refuses.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying they should get thirty grand," Jason said. "Maybe just 10%." 
</P>
<P>
 Sean's 9-year-old brother, Michael, said the movie taught him a lot about 
basketball. What he learned, he said, was "you just got to put your mind to it 
if you are going to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe he saw a different movie. Maybe it was "Rudy." 
</P>
<P>
 But at least one boy said he appreciated the film precisely because it did not 
have a predictable and sappy moral. Like "Rudy."  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like some other movies where it comes out to be a good ending," said 
Chris Carlton, 12. "It's like a true story." He was pretty sure the concluding 
subtitles, explaining how the characters ended up years later, were not really 
true. "But they could have been," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris said he was surprised that O'Neal, who also markets himself as a rap 
singer, did not have a larger role.  
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would be more about Shaq O'Neal. It was more about the coach," 
Chris said.  
</P>
<P>
 Most kids thought that O'Neal is better at acting than singing. But they 
agreed that he should probably keep his day job. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick McCaffrey, 11, observed there was "a lot of cussing" in the movie on 
the part of the coaches. But hey, he said, he's used to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Personally, what I liked about the film was what the kids didn't like: all the 
boring talk -- and the unconventional filming of the action, including mid-game 
strategy huddles. Nolte had me convinced he really was a tormented idealist, 
agonizing over his deal with the devil. 
</P>
<P>
 But one thing we agreed on hands down: It sure is a kick to watch Shaquille 
O'Neal slam-dunk.

ZOV'S KEEPS BRINGING THEM BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pint-sized post-modern cafe named Zov's Bistro may be Tustin's best 
restaurant. And Tustin knows it. I've had to fight for a table every time I've 
been here. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the main reason for its popularity is the delightful personality of 
owner Zov Karmardian, who greets every one of her customers with warmth and 
concern. But the mix of French, Italian and Middle Eastern dishes on her small 
but thoughtful menu must have something to do with it, too. And so must the 
alluring glass showcase stocked with sumptuous desserts -- Key lime pie, 
chocolate cherry bombe , fruit-studded tarts -- that greets you as you walk in. 
</P>
<P>
 Zov's has a great bring-'em-back gimmick, too: free bread to take home. People 
who dine late in the evening are often given fragrant loaves of bread wrapped 
in brown paper as they leave. The bread comes from the restaurant's bakery and 
catering facility, which one enters on the other side of the complex, Enderle 
Center, that houses the bistro. 
</P>
<P>
 I find Zov's attractive, but I wouldn't call it glamorous. The dining area is 
done in beige, offset by squiggly, earth-toned pillars and a dark floor covered 
with stone tiles. The food comes out of a shiny open kitchen, where a team of 
chefs is constantly plying saucepans or putting the finishing touches on 
plates. 
</P>
<P>
 The seating arrangement is even less glamorous. The faux-copper-topped tables 
are scrunched together carelessly, so you may find yourself rubbing elbows ( 
literally rubbing elbows) with perfect strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Karmardian is of Armenian descent, and the Near Eastern dishes on her menu are 
all extraordinarily good. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I simply cannot imagine a meal here, for instance, without the restaurant's 
appetizer combination plate ( meze ). For under $5 you get a generous 
assortment of ripe olives, feta cheese, pickled turnips, stuffed grape leaves, 
hummus, baba ghannouj , kubba and the "walnut caviar" sometimes known as 
muhamarra . Wow. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who dines regularly in health food restaurants has probably had hummus, 
that tasty spread made from pureed garbanzos flavored with sesame paste, garlic 
and lemon. 
</P>
<P>
 But baba ghannouj , made from pureed roasted eggplant instead of garbanzos, is 
equally deserving of fame. Zov's stuffed grape leaves are longer than the sort 
you would get in a Greek restaurant. There are two to an order -- 
Kermit-colored cylinders with plenty of ground meat in the rice-based filling.  
</P>
<P>
 On the meze plate you also get a couple of red-hot kubba , which are more or 
less meatballs with a cracked-wheat crust. Alongside is a tiny scoop of red 
stuff. That's muhamarra , a paste of crushed walnuts bound with pomegranate 
juice. Smear some on the warm triangles of pita bread that come on the side. 
The plate also includes a pile of crumbled feta for sprinkling on stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 One specialty at Zov's Bistro is a unique version of "Armenian pizza," 
otherwise known as lahmajune and available in any Armenian bakery. Zov's tops a 
cracker-thin crust with a savory mixture of lamb, feta cheese and tomato 
concasse . The feta and tomatoes are Karmardian's own additions, and they add a 
whole new dimension to the traditional recipe. When the crust is appropriately 
crisp (regrettably, a hit-and-miss proposition here), this is one masterful 
snack. 
</P>
<P>
 After you've worked through a squeaky-clean salad or one of the homey soups, 
such as smooth tomato-basil soup or hearty, cumin-spiked chicken-rice, it's 
time to take on the more substantial portion of this menu. At lunch, that 
translates to sandwiches such as grilled lamb with tomatoes and green 
peppercorn dressing on a homemade baguette, or an oddball sandwich known as the 
Aram -- roast beef, dill and cream cheese rolled up like a jelly roll on the 
Armenian cracker bread known as lavash.  
</P>
<P>
 At night, you'll probably be drawn to items from the Bistro Specialties 
section of the menu, where the meats, fish and pastas reside. 
</P>
<P>
 The undisputed star is roast rack of lamb, which the menu describes as "served 
medium rare with traditional pomegranate sauce." 
</P>
<P>
 In the '70s this same dish (under the Russian name sedlo ) was the specialty 
of a now-departed San Francisco restaurant named Bali's, and the tender rack at 
Zov's is the only one I can think of that comes close to that standard. 
</P>
<P>
 You can also choose the good grilled veal chop with whole-grain mustard sauce, 
or excellent swordfish with a white wine, shallot, caper, mushroom and lemon 
concoction that could be a bit less salty. 
</P>
<P>
 Zov's pastas sort of fall flat, however. The ones I've tasted were either 
overdressed (tortellini in an excessively rich spinach-walnut-basil pesto) or 
overcooked (the angel hair -- tough one to lose, too, with its imaginative 
combination of checca sauce with feta and pine nuts). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Basically, things have been fine up to this point, but I'm guessing the main 
drawing card at Zov's is the desserts. Leading the way is the low-fat Key lime 
pie, as delicious a version as I've tasted, with a smooth filling, firm 
meringue and a crusty bottom. Others include a terrifically moist chocolate 
fudge layer cake, a silken creme brulee topped with a slice of kiwi, and a 
great sour cherry cobbler. 
</P>
<P>
 I have never remembered to ask the kitchen to nix the pool of creme anglaise 
that most of these pastries are served on top of, but maybe you will. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a good enough anglaise , but I think these pastries would stand up even 
better without any Nouvelle Cuisine conventions. 
</P>
<P>
 Come during the day, by the way, and you can beat the Zov's mobs. Just walk 
around to the less crowded bakery for espresso and biscotti. 
</P>
<P>
 Zov's Bistro is high-end moderate. Sandwiches are $4.95 to $6.95. Bistro 
Specialties are $7.97 to $16.95. Desserts are $3 to $6.

LOST IN O.C.: GIVING OR RECEIVING AN EARFUL, JUST FOR EFFECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Washburn, Jim Washburn is a free-lance writer who contributes regularly 
to The Times Orange County Edition. T. Jefferson Parker's column resumes in 
this spot next week. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I've been having an etiquette problem. How do you tell someone that her gift 
to you, to put it kindly, sucks sprinkler heads? Yes, I know, the easiest and 
kindest thing would be to never bring it up, but I suspect there might be 
another dozen volumes of the thing that she might continue to give me if I say 
nothing.  
</P>
<P>
 I've thought this through every which way, and decided that if I'm going to 
bring it up, hurting feelings and possibly jeopardizing a friendship, I might 
as well get paid for it. You see, the gift in question is a CD of 75 sound 
effects, and it was given to me by the editor of this column, who fortunately 
is such a professional that she'd never let a thing like this interfere with 
her editing abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 She meant well. It isn't like the CD she bought is titled "75 Really Miserable 
Sound Effects." Instead they put spectacular in the title, over a photo of 
fireworks exploding. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is, most of the effects aren't that different from each other, and 
they all sound like they could have been recorded around the house. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, everything from "Chopping Tree" to "Galloping Horses" to "Pinball 
Machine" to "Heartbeat" sounds suspiciously to me like it might actually be 
"Man Cracking Walnuts With His Shoe," while "Indian War Whoops" should more 
realistically be titled "Squeaky Fan Belt." 
</P>
<P>
 You get the picture: "Roaring Lion," "Tropical Rainfall" and "Dog Growling" 
sound like home recordings of "Root Beer Up Nose," "Bacon in Shower" and "Bob 
Dornan on C-Span," respectively. I must admit, though, that "Women Laughing" 
sounds disquietingly like a confab of my former girlfriends, preserved forever 
in the handy compact disc format. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from being wretched, the CD was quite an insightful gift, since tucked 
away in my garage I have a sizable stack of sound-effects albums, including 
sub-genres like steam engine reveries, race car engines -- I'm not kidding, I 
have a whole album of early '60s guys revving their motors -- and those 
"environmental" creaking-masts-in-a-rain-forest records. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You never know when in life you'll need a good sound effect, so I keep 
hundreds of them at the ready. Unfortunately, the sounds that might be most 
apropos to one's career, such as "Sniveling" and "Man Taking Pay Cut," are 
difficult to locate. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd like someday to see collections of region-specific sound effects albums, 
one, say, of sounds indigenous to Orange County. It could contain titles like 
"Audience at Performing Arts Center Applauding in the Wrong Place," "BMW 
Engines Idling at the El Toro Y," "Man Cracking Walnuts With Automatic Weapons 
Fire" and "Audience at Performing Arts Center Applauding in the Wrong Place, 
Again." 
</P>
<P>
 I've been a sound-effects buff since I first listened to my favorite record at 
age 4. It was "Sherri the Squirrel" (the name has been changed to protect us 
from litigious squirrels), an audio adaptation of a live action film by one of 
the nation's leading purveyors of nature films.  
</P>
<P>
 Sherri frolicked around the forest, merrily, but for the vicious predators, 
crashing trees and raging fires trying to do her in, all represented by 
stirring sound effects. One early example of the discerning mind I since have 
applied to journalism was the way I would listen, for 15 minutes sometimes, to 
the forest fire that ended side one of the album. Eventually my mother pointed 
out that I was actually listening, over and over and over, to the crackling 
sound of the phonograph needle digging into the center groove of the record.  
</P>
<P>
 I was chatting with another of my Times pod-mates recently, and he was telling 
me of the days he used to work for this particular purveyor of nature films. 
After regaling me with tales of how a documentary crew once shoveled lemmings 
off a cliff to get a desired shot, he continued, "Of course, that's nothing 
compared to Sherri." 
</P>
<P>
 I knew I didn't want to hear it, but kept listening as he continued, "You know 
how the fox almost got Sherri? Well, the fox got Sherri. Same with the fire. 
They must have gone through hundreds of squirrels."  
</P>
<P>
 It seems that, since it's hard to direct fires and ravening animals, a lot of 
Sherris bought the farm before the cameras got the right shot. The daily rushes 
would be one take of furry carnage after another. From a squirrel's point of 
view, "Sherri the Squirrel" must be the von Stroheim's "Greed" of nature films. 
</P>
<P>
 I still have my Sherri album, though I don't think I could bring myself to 
listen to it now. That's OK, I have hundreds of albums I can't bring myself to 
listen to, mostly for aesthetic reasons. I buy god-awful records the way some 
people take in stray cats.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For example, I have a heap of "tribal" drum records that were briefly popular 
in the early '60s. The recordings were ostensibly African, by a "prince" who 
was invariably claimed to be the last member of his tribe. Usually, they 
instead sounded like bored union musicians getting paid scale to bang on stuff. 
The worst of the bunch, perhaps, was a bongo-happy affair called "The Savage 
Rhythms of Modesto." I presume the creators had a hoot naming their "prince" 
after the then-obscure California town. 
</P>
<P>
 I also collect live concert bootlegs, some of which I think are among the most 
important musical documents of our time, and others of which I have to admit I 
collect because they are so utterly distorted. There's a bootleg of the Band in 
which you'd swear the peerless American group was performing underwater. With 
wool mittens on. 
</P>
<P>
 Another abominable recording was one of Black Sabbath -- not entirely the most 
refined musical outfit to begin with -- on a boot called "Love in Chicago" that 
reputedly was made by the Mafia. Whoever made it, it sounds as if it were 
recorded at a construction site, maybe in the same city the band was playing 
in. It's nonstop rumble. Did I mention it's a double album? 
</P>
<P>
 If I had to pick the most pathetic album I have -- and bear in mind, this is 
from a collection with "Songs of the Humpback Whale" and no fewer than six Yoko 
albums -- it might be "Stay Safe!" Its grooves contain "family" sounds: chairs 
scraping, food being consumed, and people engaging in insipid bickerings and 
arguments. According to the cover, it was intended to be played when you're not 
home, to give burglars the ambient impression there is a houseful of folks 
inside. I suspect instead that it was a play that was so ruinously bad that 
this was the only way they could market it. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think I'd ever sell this album, largely because I'm positive I'll 
never find anyone who would want to buy it. Given time, I suppose I'll come to 
have a similar warm regard for my "75 Spectacular Sound Effects" CD.

CLINTON WELFARE CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * By advocating the taxing of food stamps and the cutting of welfare and SSI 
benefits, President Clinton has forsaken the roots and basic principles of the 
Democratic Party. For many decades the Democrats have been the party of 
compassion and the defender of the little guy and the downtrodden. 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to help the poor is the creation of jobs, even if they are the 
WPA-CCC-type jobs that President Roosevelt implemented. As many other counties 
do, we could put in a value-added tax where the burden is spread to everyone. 
If he wants to cut welfare, why doesn't he cut welfare for the affluent, such 
as the subsidy to the wool and mohair producers, which has been in place since 
the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
 Must we once again dump on the poor, handicapped and elderly?

ACKNOWLEDGING BLACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Ron Harris' thoughts articulated in "History for One and All" (Feb. 4) 
certainly mirrored my ambiguity towards black history month. 
</P>
<P>
 As a private school elementary teacher (retired), I attempted to incorporate 
black history into the daily curriculum. This required a very time-consuming 
effort to draw from many resources. A single month just doesn't afford ample 
time to explore the events and accomplishments of a great people who so 
significantly contributed to the story of our illustrious nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Our textbooks must be rewritten to be inclusive of all people; thus 
eliminating the need for "special" months.

<P>
 * In response to "Acknowledging a Terrible Sacrifice" by S. Allen Counter, 
Commentary, Feb. 13:  
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of how many hyphenates are invented by the current generations of 
black Americans, it is impossible to accurately relate to the degree of 
suffering and misery experienced by those millions of initial hostages upon 
whose blood, sweat and tears the economic foundation of this now-great country 
was built. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the descendants of those original slaves are the only group, other 
than the aboriginal American Indians, who come close to qualifying as "original 
Americans." Their losses far exceeded that experienced by the Jewish citizens 
of Europe under Hitler, yet in all America there is not one memorial 
acknowledging their sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
 Even along the African coast many of the slave-holding pens and prisons and 
other artifacts of the period have been preserved as a reminder of that great 
scar on Africa's history. 
</P>
<P>
 I fully support Counter's suggestion, and think that it should be demanded of 
the U.S. government that a memorial be commissioned and erected in this 
nation's capital to commemorate the contributions and sufferings made by black 
slaves of America in the building of this country. Such a monument would lend 
more to mending the stripped pride and esteem of black Americans than anything 
else I can imagine. White America needs to come to grips with the magnitude of 
injustice inflicted upon its black citizens, in much the same way that it is 
now doing with the Native Americans. Very much like the Holocaust, there are 
too many whites who find it easier to pretend that the horrors of slavery have 
been exaggerated, or worse, that slavery never really existed.

 * It's too bad homeless activist Len Doucette felt discriminated against when 
he was turned away from a Red Cross emergency shelter after the earthquake 
(Jan. 31). The Los Angeles Mission was here long before the Northridge quake 
and stands ready and willing to provide Doucette shelter, food and 
rehabilitation.

TURKISH ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * "Honeymoon Is Over for Turkish Prime Minister" (World Report, Feb. 15), 
while tending to emphasize only the negative developments in Turkey, falls 
short of pointing out some recent remarkable achievements that Turkey has 
realized in domestic and external affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The article fails to note that the Turkish economy has grown at the rate of 8% 
in 1993, the highest growth rate among OCED countries.Turkey enjoys the highest 
foreign currency reserves in its history, which reached $18.5 billion last 
month. Also, foreign tourism revenues hit a record level of more than $4 
billion in 1993. With $150 billion of GNP, according to the World Bank, the 
Turkish economy today ranks as the 17th largest in the world; Turkey is 
considered one of the most successful emerging markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey realized these economic achievements despite its enormous losses, that 
amounted to $20 billion, as a result of the Persian Gulf crisis. As will be 
recalled, Turkey took a resolute and a decisive stand during this crisis by 
joining efforts with the international coalition and by fully implementing the 
U.N. resolutions regarding the economic embargo. The ill effects of the Gulf 
crisis still continue to be a great burden on the Turkish economy in many 
respects. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Turkey's major external achievements in 1993, it is worth mentioning 
that the PKK is outlawed by almost all Western countries and Turkey's NATO 
allies, in a show of support for Turkey's combat against this international 
terrorist organization.

FAILED JAPAN TRADE TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * While I applaud President Clinton's attempt to force Japan to stop its 
restrictive trade policies (Feb. 12), NAFTA will let Japan get in through the 
back door by allowing Japan to produce cars in Mexico and ship them into the 
U.S. duty-free. Do you suppose the fact that Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa is aware of this has strengthened his stand against dropping Japan's 
trade barriers? Why should he fear American retaliation when he knows that 
NAFTA gives Japan an even better deal? 
</P>

 * There is much I agree with in the commentary by Alan Stoga (Feb. 8) 
regarding trade friction between Japan and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the several statements I disagree with, the most glaring is as follows: 
"But the core U.S. demand, in effect, that Japan should guarantee specific 
shares of its market for American-made imports. . . ." Stoga is wrong in his 
interpretation of the American position. This is the "spin" Japan gives the 
trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
 I have not heard Clinton, Lloyd Bentsen, Ron Brown or Mickey Kantor make 
statements as described by Stoga. What they have said repeatedly is that some 
system must be devised to measure progress to which both countries can concur. 
Japan and the United States both agree that the trade deficit with the U.S. 
must be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 This Administration's position is a far cry from managed trade, such as was 
instituted by the Bush Administration regarding the semiconductor industry. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * Hosokawa's obdurate stance against easing the inequitable trade balance 
between his country and the U.S. is a cynical insult, and should not be 
tolerated. Enough of pacifying and turning of cheek in the face of such 
monumental conceit. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton should lose no time to implement the high-priority, 
high-profile trade actions against Japan that are at his disposal. It is high 
time we utilize some of the tactics, admittedly onerous, but favored for so 
long by Japan, like "harassment tools" on automobiles, limiting Japanese 
cellular telephone sales in the U.S., scaling back tax benefits given to 
Japanese auto makers in the U.S., and enforcing laws against the practice of 
"dumping." 
</P>
<P>
 Appeasement has been exposed as a horrendous military failure. It is no less a 
losing proposition in commerce, where one "trading" party has been consistently 
hostile and uncooperative for more than four decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Not incidentally, those of us who continue to opt for Japanese cars and 
trucks, despite their much greater cost and the proven equality of 
American-made models, give comfort and support to our economic enemy.

</P>
<P>
 The U.S. can build scientific products and equipment that can go to the moon, 
yet somehow the Japanese allege that the quality of our manufactured products 
does not meet the standards for their ordinary little automobiles. Let's 
respond that the quality of the Japanese "business ethic" does not meet our 
standards, and refuse their business as they refuse our products. Let us 
proceed from there.

 * In response to "In Japan, Fair Trade Is Matter of Perception," news 
analysis, Feb. 17: Contained in that otherwise useful article is a phrase that 
also perpetuates a perception, one that reinforces the value of confrontation 
over debate, that Japan prohibited trade with foreigners until " . . . the 
cannons of Commodore Matthew Perry's Black Ships abruptly ended the empire's 
isolation."  
</P>
<P>
 Samuel Eliot Morison's biography, "Old Bruin Commodore Matthew Calbraith 
Perry" (1967), clearly reports Perry's (not so abrupt -- over a period of five 
years) negotiation with Japan as unique in an era of gunboat diplomacy. Perry 
was praised as having brought: "This secluded empire into the intercourse of 
nations as one of the great events of the age . . . the more so as it has been 
accomplished, not by bloodshed and the devastation of war, but by means of a 
frank, energetic and determined course of negotiation." 
</P>
<P>
 We need less loose cannons and more diplomacy. And more knowledge of the 
difference between special interests and public benefit on both sides of the 
Pacific. Even today Japanese use the phrase "black ships" to characterize 
unwanted foreign pressure, but the political dynamic in Japan in the 1850s was 
a domestic desire to end isolation and feudal oppression.

WE DO IT TO THEM, THEY DO IT TO US; SHOCK OF ALL AMAZING SHOCKS, RUSSIAN SPY 
FOUND IN NATION'S CAPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Are we alone in finding a degree of naivete, even implausibility, in the 
indignation being expressed in some quarters in Washington over what is shaping 
up as the most damaging spy case in recent years? 
</P>
<P>
 Knowledgeable government officials actually profess to be shocked -- shocked! 
-- that in the post-Cold War era Russia's depleted but still obviously very 
active spying services would continue to conduct operations abroad, 
specifically against the world's only remaining superpower, as our political 
leaders like to say. That is some thumb-in-your-eye thanks after all this 
country has done for President Boris Yeltsin and his predecessor -- the 
economic aid, the political support, not least the timely warnings we provided 
(based, of course, on our own intelligence work) about the plots that were 
hatched against them. Moscow, they say, really ought to apologize and summon 
home those of its embassy officials who were involved in this disgraceful 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's get real. The Cold War may be over, but intelligence gathering and 
spying go on. The Russians and others do it to us and, as former CIA Director 
Robert Gates noted the other night, we do it to them, because "it's important 
that we know what they're up to." That the Soviet KGB and its successor agency 
in Russia were apparently able, beginning in 1985, the first year of Mikhail 
Gorbachev's perestroika , to put on the payroll a mid-level but 
very-well-plugged-in CIA official is plainly a matter of political 
embarrassment and profound frustration. But any top government officials who 
were genuinely surprised by what was revealedthis week are guilty of 
world-class disingenuousness. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Clinton Administration, which inherited this scandal, exposure of a 
32-year employee of the CIA as an alleged spy adds enormously to the 
difficulties it already faced in winning even continuing support on Capitol 
Hill for aid to Russia. Combined with other recent doubt-raising events -- the 
triumph of political extremists in last December's legislative elections, the 
virtual abandonment of reforms by Yeltsin's new government -- the case of 
Aldrich Ames, who was arrested along with his wife on espionage charges, can 
only be expected to lower expectations that closer ties and greater cooperation 
with Russia can soon be achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 That response is understandable. It also ought quickly to yield to calmer 
second thoughts. Spying, however odious it may be, remains a fact of 
international life. It happens sometimes even among the oldest or best of 
friends, as cases a few years back involving French and Israeli espionage 
against the United States show. Anger is a warranted reaction. But it would be 
foolishly self-wounding to let the Ames case deflect Washington from pursuing 
policies toward Russia that serve U.S. national interests. When all is said and 
done, it remains vitally important for America and the West to go on doing what 
they can to encourage the evolution of a Russia based on political pluralism 
and a free-market economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the mess left by the Ames case has to be cleaned up. The full 
extent of the harm done to U.S. agents and interests over the seven or eight 
years when pure-gold information was being sold to the Russians has to be 
evaluated. So too do the internal security procedures for CIA employees. The 
second rule in spying, after "Don't get caught," is "Don't draw attention to 
yourself." Yet in their spending habits, the Ameses left a trail of glaring 
obviousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the period of alleged spying, says the government, the Ameses' 
expenditures exceeded their income by more than $1 million. Did no one at the 
CIA whose job it is to take note of such conspicuous consumption -- the 
$540,000 home, the $40,000 car, the $500,000 in credit-card charges -- wonder 
where all the money could be coming from? President Clinton has praised the 
counterespionage work done to break this case. No doubt the praise is deserved. 
But still to be explained is why, given the Ameses' remarkably showy lifestyle, 
it took so long for the bloodhounds to get on the trail.

SHAME IN THE SERVICE OF THE PUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shame, according to some New Age gurus, is a destructive emotion that has no 
place in a caring society. All we know is that shame certainly has its place in 
Los Angeles County government.Public shame may well be the only reason why the 
L.A. County Board of Supervisors finally froze outrageous pension benefits that 
should never have been allowed. Supervisor Ed Edelman, who last week had 
opposed reforms pushed by Supervisor Gloria Molina, suddenly told his 
colleagues, "We need to put this behind us," and agreed to back major changes 
in the pension plan. 
</P>
<P>
 That plan, approved in 1990, calculated fringe benefits as if they were salary 
for the purposes of setting pensions. The result was that some county employees 
would earn more in retirement than while working; the pensions of the most 
senior employees, including some elected supervisors, would be boosted by up to 
19%. All of this, of course, comes from the pockets of you, the taxpayers, and 
of course you were pointedly not consulted about the changes costing more than 
$400 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeze approved Tuesday helps control the growth of pension costs, but 
does not rescind benefits already granted. Still, the turnabout by Edelman and 
Supervisors Mike Antonovich and Deane Dana is a victory, considering that last 
week they were fighting the key reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 This week's change of heart just happened to follow a steady barrage of 
negative publicity that catapulted into high gear last week. So shame, at least 
in the Hall of Administration, does have its place.

U.S. SPIES! RUSSIAN SPIES! WHO WOULD HAVE BELIEVED IT!; AMES CASE: WASHINGTON'S 
INDIGNATION IS HYPOCRITICAL -- OR IS IT A COLD WAR HANGOVER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VLADIMIR POZNER, Vladimir Pozner, a journalist in the former Soviet Union, 
co-hosts Pozner & Donahue on CNBC-TV and hosts a similar show in Moscow.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The arrest of Aldrich Ames, a former CIA counterintelligence official, and his 
wife, once a paid CIA informer, on charges of spying for Russia has raised a 
ruckus that both amazes and amuses me. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's brief assessment, delivered with the additional gravity of the 
now famously clenched underlip; the secretary of state's solemn pronouncements, 
including the threat that the United States would not tolerate Russian spying; 
a prominent senator's call to stop all aid to Russia -- which, I am sure, has 
been joined by a host of other fellow travelers even as I write -- all of this 
would seem to indicate that the entire government of the United States is 
staggered and outraged by Russia's continued intelligence activities. They 
would like the country to believe that they expected the Russians, once the 
Cold War was over, to recall all undercover agents, slam the door on the 
recruitment of all foreign nationals, in short, to close shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that is preposterous. Nevertheless, many Americans are honestly 
upset and angry and, I am sure, have happily reverted to their Cold War mode of 
thinking about Russia. I realize how difficult a task I have set myself in 
trying to reason with what is a powerful emotional reaction; nevertheless, here 
goes. 
</P>
<P>
 So what was Ames' job? Ah, yes, he worked for the Central Intelligence 
Agency's Soviet counterintelligence branch. And what does counterintelligence 
do? Well, among other things, it recruits agents in other countries, believe it 
or not. Now, does anyone in the United States think that with the demise of the 
Soviet Union, the CIA's Soviet counterintelligence operation was shut down? 
Does anyone doubt that the CIA continues to spy on, and recruit in, Russia? 
Well, some people may, but believe me, their names are not Bill Clinton, Warren 
Christopher or Dennis DeConcini. They know full well, as you all should, that 
the United States spies not only on such unfriendly countries as China, Cuba, 
Iraq, Libya and Iran, but also on such allies as Japan, Germany, Britain, 
France and Israel. And, hold on to your seats, ladies and gentlemen, those 
allies spy on the United States! 
</P>
<P>
 A case in point is Jonathan Pollard, an American now serving a life sentence 
for having spied on America for Israel. Sure, his crime and punishment were 
greeted by some political gnashing of teeth and talk about stopping U.S. aid to 
Israel (roughly $3 billion annually, incomparably more than Russia's). But 
cooler heads prevailed, and it even became possible for Israel's prime minister 
to publicly ask for Pollard's release. That was denied and rightly so: Pollard 
is a traitor, and treason in any country is considered the worst of crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Should Ames be proved guilty, he, too, should get the maximum sentence -- as 
should any Russian who betrays his country. I have no problem with that view. 
What I do have a problem with is public officials who play on the political 
naivete of the people whose interests they purportedly have at heart -- your 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be wonderful to live in a spy-free world. It would be delightful if 
all countries signed a declaration pledging to disband their intelligence and 
counterintelligence services (although verification would be a nightmare). It 
would be grand if they all shared with each other their lists of turncoat 
agents. But I must disappoint you: It ain't gonna happen. As long as military, 
political, economic and technological secrets continue to exist, so will 
espionage. And as long as espionage exists, so will traitors who, for whatever 
reasons -- greed, pride, vengeance, you name it -- will spill their countries' 
secrets. As long as traitors exist, they will be apprehended, and there always 
will be people hoping to make political hay out of it all.  
</P>
<P>
 But the Ames case has an additional dimension: The reason for all the 
histrionics we are being subjected to relates only in part to the uncovering of 
a Russian mole in the CIA. In a much more fundamental way, it has to do with a 
mentality that says: "We won the Cold War, so how dare they do anything that 
displeases us!" What we are witnessing is a childish temper tantrum thrown by 
people who deep in their hearts regret that Russia and the Russians have not 
rolled over and played dead. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time to grow up.

COLUMN LEFT/ BARRY GLASSNER: 'DOWNSIZINGS' TRANSLATE TO HUMAN MISERY; 
UNNECESSARY CORPORATE SHUFFLES SHOULD MEET CONSUMER BOYCOTTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY GLASSNER, Barry Glassner, chair of the Sociology Department at the 
University of Southern California, is the author of Career Crash: The New 
Crisis and Who Survives (Simon and Schuster, 1994.) 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An eager young man from AT&T called during dinner. He cheerfully offered me 
$75 if I would switch from my current long-distance carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 I told him what AT&T can do with their 75 bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, I'm polite to telephone sales people, even when my mouth is full of 
fish, but I was angry at the man's employer. A few hours earlier, AT&T had 
announced plans to lay off 15,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows, the fellow who called me might be among those tossed into the 
street. In retrospect, I feel guilty about the way I treated him. But I'm fed 
up with companies laying off their workers. I know too many people who have 
lost their homes and their self-esteem in unnecessary downsizings. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T is just the latest in a string of profitable companies over the past few 
months that have turned thousands of lives upside down. Last month, it was 
Scott Paper (8,300 people). In December it was Xerox (10,000). November was 
Philip Morris (14,000) and Bell South (10,200). 
</P>
<P>
 The excuse is always the same: "international competitiveness." The real 
reason is greed. A company's stock price almost always rises after it announces 
a big layoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The misery rate for employees also increases sharply -- for those laid off and 
also for those who remain. The survivors have to do twice as much work in an 
environment where everybody's demoralized and waiting for the next ax to fall. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of a service company like AT&T, customers will almost certainly 
suffer as well. What's going to put an end to layoff mania? An improving 
economy hasn't done the trick. American corporations announced 108,000 layoffs 
last month, the highest number in four years, more than at the peak of the 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither does experience seem to deter corporate officials. The American 
Management Assn. recently surveyed 900 executives at companies that had 
downsized. Sixty percent said they had seen no productivity gain and one in 
five actually admitted to declining earnings.  
</P>
<P>
 Only a revolt by socially responsible investors can push CEOs to change their 
ways. Promiscuous downsizing should be up there beside despoiling the 
environment, doing business in South Africa and producing weapons, tobacco and 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 Refusing to invest in companies that downsize not only makes good ethical 
sense, it also makes good investment sense. While a company's stock may rise 
just after a mass layoff is announced, the effect is usually short-term. A 
study by Mitchell & Co. of the 16 largest downsizers of the mid-1980s found 
that the stock prices for these companies trailed their competitors' by an 
average of 26% three years after they restructured. 
</P>
<P>
 The revolt by investors could be augmented by a consumer revolt. Every time we 
hear a company brag about layoffs, we should make a mental note and stop giving 
them our money. 
</P>
<P>
 I can just see the bumper sticker: Ma Bell with a diagonal red line across her 
face.

 "Our first cattle call," said Dayna Schenker-Greene of Marina del Rey, 
smoothing a wayward blond strand on 4-year-old daughter Jordyn's head. "She's 
been wanting to do this for a very long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Onstage, a cheerleader warmed up the crowd: "How many actors do I have out 
here? Do I have some actresses out here?" The response was a roar. 
</P>
<P>
 This happening was running 45 minutes late and even Jim Lord, owner of host 
Beverly Hills Studios -- a school for aspiring actors -- was helping set up 
more chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The real pitch was about to begin. Out trotted two alums: Austin St. John of 
"Power Rangers" and Bonnie "Saved by the Bell" Russavage.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's always going to be someone who's cuter, funnier, prettier, 
handsomer," offered Bonnie, to those flirting with fame. So, hey, just be 
yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 One by one, the kids paraded up and spoke into the camera. Name, age, assigned 
ID number. Some were barely audible. Others came on like Baby June. One spouted 
his number, then added, "and don't lose it!" 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Hijazi had brought her son, Salim, 6, from Montebello. "He's talking 
four languages," she volunteered -- Armenian, Arabic, Spanish and English. And 
he's only in first grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberly Taft, at 18 an older kid in this lineup, didn't seem quite sure why 
she'd come all the way from San Diego. The blond waitress/model, whose 
decolletage revealed a rose tattoo, said, "I don't plan on paying for any 
classes. I've been told if you have it, you don't need classes." 
</P>
<P>
 But others, responding to follow-up calls, were in class a week later. At 
Beverly Hills Studios they would be taught to act in commercials and/or TV and 
films and learn the business of show business: getting an agent, all about 
unions, reading the trades. 
</P>
<P>
 At one session, Nancy Sullivan, a veteran of commercials, was teaching 
beginners. First, a few words about shoulder pads -- "You look like a truck on 
camera." Now, "Do we have any huge-fingernail people here?" 
</P>
<P>
 Giggling and cringing, students watched themselves on film. "Smile!" commanded 
Sullivan, razzing one boy about his "America's Most Wanted" look. Don't twitch. 
Don't scratch. And "Don't ask me what your name is. Tell me." 
</P>
<P>
 Down the hall, in an advanced class, perky teacher Victoria Hoffman was 
exhorting teen-age girls doing a fake take for Skittles to think perky. "If you 
feel like an idiot, you're probably doing it right." 
</P>
<P>
 A few evenings later, it was showcase time at Beverly Hills Studios. Ten 
talent agencies had come for the debuts of 48 students, ranging in age from 6 
to 33. Each was armed with a list for checking those who interested them. 
</P>
<P>
 As students went through their choreographed pitches for shampoo, hamburgers, 
deodorant, the agents looked for energy . That's the buzzword. 
</P>
<P>
 Shana O'Neil of the Bobby Ball Agency scribbled "acty" by some names. The kiss 
of death. But she and just about everyone else fell for a 10-year-old charmer 
named Stefanie, an Orange County blonde, as they're known in the trade. "This 
little girl could sell you anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, teacher Bob Bancroft, an actor himself, flipped through the check 
lists, calculating that about 90 agent interviews would come out of tonight's 
showcase. Also-rans would be recirculated. 
</P>
<P>
 For a few, their training here would prove to be mainly what he termed "a 
growing and learning experience" -- an experience that can cost a couple of 
thousand dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be foolish, said Jim Lord, to turn anyone away on the basis of looks 
or talent: "People think if you're not a 10, you can't work in the industry. 
It's totally untrue." But the school, now six years old, does weed out kids -- 
and parents -- who don't seem committed. Job auditions are often last-minute 
calls; a parent must drop everything and play chauffeur. 
</P>
<P>
 A Saturday talent search that attracts 500 will, typically, bring in 60-70 new 
students. "Money becomes an issue," Lord said, as does the realization that 
acting is work. "One of the things we work on here is the difference between 
dreams and reality." 
</P>
<P>
 In an average year, 800 students will complete classes and, Lord estimated, 
65-85% of them will get agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Are there enough gigs out there? 
</P>
<P>
 Bancroft talked about an "explosion" of kids' roles. But Larry Corsa of 
Epstein Wyckoff Lamanna agency said, "The supply has already exceeded the 
demand." Still, agencies keep coming back, looking for a few good kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Does one really need to go to school to pitch pizza? "Absolutely not," Corsa 
said. Some kids will be called from unsolicited photos sent by parents. 
</P>
<P>
 But Corsa has been very lucky with kids from Beverly Hills Studios. He's found 
them savvy, yet not robotized -- in short, not "Shirley Templed out." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, there is some magic called It . A 6-year-old who has it can earn 
$100,000 a year right off with a string of national commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 But the well can dry up quickly. Corsa said, "All of a sudden you start 
hearing, 'Oh, you know, he's a little overexposed . . . it's make hay while the 
sun shines -- before they decide you're last year's kid." Excuses Will Drive 
You Deeper Into Debt 
</P>
<P>
 And now, the top 10 excuses for cheating in L.A.'s car-pool lanes (culled from 
CHP reports): 
</P>
<P>
 1. I've never come this way before. 
</P>
<P>
 2. I thought this was the fast lane. 
</P>
<P>
 3. I was forced in here to avoid an accident. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Somebody's car broke down in my lane. 
</P>
<P>
 5. I had to go to the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Everybody else is doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 7. My uncle (brother, other relative) is sick and I have to get to them 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 8. The diamond was upside down. 
</P>
<P>
 9. I'm from out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 And, finally, this exchange: 
</P>
<P>
 Officer: "The reason I stopped you is because you are a solo occupant riding 
in a car-pool lane." 
</P>
<P>
 Citizen: "Are you talking to me?" 
</P>
<P>
 (For the record, all of the above drivers were ticketed; first violation fine: 
$271.)

 Royalty's visiting. His Royal Highness Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, will 
be preeminent April 7 when Bob Hope is honored at a dinner with Charlton Heston 
as master of ceremonies. It's black-tie at the Beverly Wilshire. 
</P>
<P>
 William Lyon, retired Air Force major general, is dinner chairman and Georgia 
Frontiere honorary co-chair. The affair, benefiting the American Air Museum in 
Britain, is $500 for dinner, $1,000 if you accept for the reception with Hope 
and the Duke of York.

 Upcoming Gala: California native son and former President Richard Nixon is 
coming home to Yorba Linda. Caroline Ahmanson and Lodwrick M. Cook will 
co-chair the black-tie "Legacy of Peace" tribute to the 37th President on June 
16 at the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's daughter Julie Nixon Eisenhower flew into town to meet Ahmanson, Cook 
and John Argue last week at a luncheon heralding the affair.  
</P>
<P>
 The evening is billed as a spectacular tribute featuring a "White House State 
Dinner" prepared by Henry Haller, executive chef for five Presidents -- Lyndon 
Johnson, Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds go to the library. The goal is 250 tickets sold at $2,500 for a gross 
of $625,000.

 Skytop: As the city's lights twinkled through the Italian pines surrounding 
Walter and Peggy Grauman's skytop home in Bel-Air, more than 150 mulled the 
choices -- whether to stand and be mesmerized by the sight or turn to the 
sights inside where the Graumans have recently rearranged their eclectic 
collections of memorabilia.  
</P>
<P>
 It was a night for the hosts' two Persian cats, Sweetpea and Jennifer, to be 
confined to Peggy's shower, but each well-endowed with a Williams-Sonoma glass 
of water and a blue and white Japanese bowl of kibble. 
</P>
<P>
 But, if there's one thing the Graumans love almost as much as their 
collections -- and cats -- it's the Spotlight Awards for young talent in the 
performing arts. They've been deeply involved, along with Helen Bing, for six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 This year the Spotlight event will be March 29. Last week, the Music Center's 
Fraternity of Friends hosted a cocktail party at the Graumans' to kick off the 
awards, which are sponsored now by Pacific Telesis Foundation and provide a 
competition for $45,000 in scholarships for high school students. Friends 
president Fred Roberts and Anne Johnson will assist in staging the event. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Graumans', Spotlight committee members joined in the fun -- Sandra 
Ausman, Allan Burns, Caryl and A.J. Carothers, Bridget Martens, Suzanne Marx 
and Diane Morton. After marveling at how the Graumans keep everything so 
dust-free, they all devoured Rococo-catered sausages, veggies and skewered 
chicken in the kitchen while three shiny black grand pianos tinkled away.

 Vision: Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary, the first woman and the first 
African American to serve in the Cabinet post, never stood still at the Black 
Business Assn.'s 20th annual awards dinner Thursday evening at the Westin 
Bonaventure. 
</P>
<P>
 Roaming the room with a microphone and a peripatetic gait, she said she was 
doing what she likes best -- "talk and walk." She cajoled her audience and put 
it in the palm of her hand with her comment, "Nothing changes without vision. . 
. . It's a bold business future we are after." 
</P>
<P>
 The BBA began 20 years ago when a group of black businessmen set out to visit 
the leading CEOs in town. Last week, 600 assembled in black-tie to honor 
numerous companies and individuals who have contributed to opportunities for 
minority and women-owned businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening also was a celebration of Black History Month. The group paid 
tribute to dinner chairman John E. Bryson, chairman and CEO of Southern 
California Edison, which was one of the first supporters of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Prominent in the crowd were BBA board chairwoman Mary Ann Mitchell; 
Assemblywoman Gwen Moore, who was honorary dinner chairwoman; Bill Nesbit; 
Alescia Buford; John LeDay; Lillian Pernell; Skip Cooper; George A. Bivins Jr.; 
Betty Johnson; Michael York; Larry McCormick; Fawn Jordan; Vince Bryson; Bill 
Hawkins; Jerry Medley; Carlis McGhee and Marilyn Morton.

 Nancy for MS: Celebs and friends of Nancy Davis braved snow and sleet to join 
her crusade to fund research into the cause and cure for multiple sclerosis -- 
the Race to Erase MS -- in Aspen. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the proceeds will go to UCLA for work directed by Dr. George Ellison.  
</P>
<P>
 Ken Rickel, Davis' fiance, joined her on the slopes. So did her mother, 
Barbara Davis, and celebs Marlee Matlin, Harry Hamlin, Kenny Loggins and Lynda 
Carter.  
</P>
<P>
 Seen two-stepping at the Hotel Jerome at Friday night's Western party were 
race auction chair Lynn Palmer and husband Paul, Lee and Darrien Iacocca, Paul 
and Kymberly Marciano, Jolene and George Schlatter, and Justine and Robert 
Bloomingdale.

 Birthdays: Angelenos were in black-tie in Washington earlier this month for 
former President Ronald Reagan's 83rd birthday. Lady Margaret Thatcher was 
keynoter at the National Building Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 And a large crowd of Junior Fellows and benefactors turned out for breakfast 
at the Huntington Library in San Marino to celebrate Abraham Lincoln's 185th 
birthday and watch Dr. B. Eugene Griessan dramatize famous Lincoln moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Youngsters were in abundance: Nancy Call brought grandchildren Joe and Tom 
McCullough and Phineas and Patrick Regan; Diana Callery brought Maggie and 
Caroline Blaney; Susan Chandler brought daughter Katie, and Dorrie Poole came 
with several young Pooles.

 Kudos: To Peggy Slater, San Pedro resident honored by Childrens Hospital Los 
Angeles for her multimillion-dollar estate gift to the hospital. Slater is 
known as the sailing world's Amelia Earhart, holding 800 trophies for sailing 
prowess. A floor of the hospital's new outpatient tower has been dedicated to 
her.

TEACHERS EARN KUDOS FOR BLENDING IN ARTS

 "Wasn't this a beautiful day?" producer-director Garry Marshall asked the 
several hundred teachers, school principals, education administrators and 
others who had just finished a pasta buffet in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion's 
Grand Hall. "There were no quakes, no riots, no fires. It's a great day in Los 
Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 It was also a pretty good day for Los Angeles-area teachers, 69 of whom were 
recognized Tuesday as nominees for the 12th annual BRAVO Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Created by the Music Center Education Division, the awards recognize teachers 
of kindergarten through 12th grade for innovation and creativity in integrating 
the arts into their classroom instruction. Marshall, whose mother taught dance 
for 50 years, was the ceremony's celebrity presenter for the 11th consecutive 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 After a welcome from Music Center President Shelton G. Stanfill, the nominees, 
who were chosen by principals or faculty committees, were cited by Music Center 
Education Division co-chairman and program emcee Sidney A. Thompson, 
superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District, and Stuart E. 
Gothold, superintendent of L.A. County Office of Education. (The third 
co-chair, Caroline Ahmanson, had been called away on business, missing the 
ceremony for the first time.) Video clips captured the 11 finalists at work -- 
teaching art to a second-grade bilingual Chinese/English class, supervising a 
jazz-band practice, incorporating drama into history. 
</P>
<P>
 The two winners were Darnelle Hayes Davidson of Manhattan Beach, in the arts 
specialist category, and Dilip Saxena of Riverside, in the general classroom 
category. His wife, Debi, was also a nominee. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson has taught music and dance at Los Angeles High School for seven 
years. Her students have won the Los Angeles Unified School District band and 
drill-team city championship for the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels wonderful to be recognized by so many people and share the 
experience with so many who really care about the arts and preserving them in 
the schools," Davidson said after the ceremony. "The arts allow us to relax, be 
creative and let our emotions out.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many negative things happening in our world -- our students need 
to have something very positive, to believe they can make a difference. Once 
they can start believing in themselves the sky's the limit." 
</P>
<P>
 Saxena, 34, also a seven-year teaching veteran, uses video, painting, music 
and drama in his sixth-grade classes at Washington Elementary School in Norco, 
using the arts to teach reading, written and oral language, math, science and 
social science.  
</P>
<P>
 "Children learn in different ways," he said. "Students who can't write things 
down can express things in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found art is a very secure medium for students to convey what they want to 
me. Once they do, they feel good about themselves. Maybe no one has ever told 
them before 'I like it.' Once you recognize the positive, say in dance, then 
they try their hardest in other areas."

PRACTICAL VIEW: CHATTING THE HIGH-TECH WAY, ON THE WOMEN'S WIRE; ON-LINE: IN 
THIS NEW "ELECTRONIC COMMUNITY," WOMEN USE CYBERSPACE TO EXCHANGE EXPERIENCES 
IN EVERYTHING FROM HOME REPAIRS TO MENOPAUSE. 
</P>

<P>
 Ellen Pack and Nancy Rhine officially launched Women's Wire last month by 
inviting a large group of friends to chat with some guest experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel writer Thalia Zepatos offered safety tips for women traveling alone. 
Computer guru Esther Dyson predicted where the electronics industry is headed. 
Greens Restaurant chef Annie Somerville answered questions about gourmet 
vegetarian cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 Women from all over the country participated -- but nobody had to leave home. 
The audience was connected by its modems to Women's Wire, the world's first 
on-line computer service aimed specifically at the needs and interests of 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it can become a very practical part of a woman's life," says Pack, 
28, a New Yorker with an MBA from Columbia University. "It's just now becoming 
a tool that can save you time and money." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not mysterious -- it's not going to take the place of the telephone or 
personal conversation," says Rhine, 43, a Midwesterner who has worked with 
computers since the 1970s. "It's just a convenient way to reach individuals and 
groups that is becoming very valuable." 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewed by phone from their office complex in San Francisco, Pack and 
Rhine discuss their plans for bringing women into the world called 
"cyberspace." (The current estimate, according to Online Access magazine, is 
that only 15% to 20% of all on-line systems users are women.) 
</P>
<P>
 Pack and Rhine envision subscribers turning to Women's Wire for information on 
everything from health and finances to movie reviews, and also using its 
interactive capabilities to share experiences, find jobs, solve problems and 
just schmooze.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some women who have businesses at home say it's their virtual water cooler," 
says Rhine. "They can log on and network. It really combats isolation."  
</P>
<P>
 Women's Wire is the latest entry in the emerging world of commercial on-line 
services -- led by Prodigy and Compuserve -- that are not yet household words, 
but getting closer, as home computers become more affordable.  
</P>
<P>
 "The understanding is growing," says Pack, "but there's still a gap -- the 
people who haven't used it just don't have any concept of what is involved." 
</P>
<P>
 The process, she adds, is relatively simple -- all it takes is a personal 
computer and a modem that connects your computer to a telephone line to send 
information in and out. 
</P>
<P>
 Through it you can dial a commercial computer system that typically provides 
the following: 
</P>
<P>
 * Read-only information such as stock prices, weather and news.  
</P>
<P>
 * Messaging forums to exchange ideas and information on topical issues in 
which users post messages for anyone who dials in. 
</P>
<P>
 * Personal mailbox for exchanging private messages. Subscribers can also 
exchange electronic mail (E-mail) with anyone who has an address on Internet (a 
global computer network) or participate in Usenet groups with topics ranging 
from pet care to restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 * Interactive activities such as the Women's Wire chat sessions in which 
audience and speakers engaged by typing and sending questions and answers 
electronically. 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, says Pack, this breaks down into two basic types of 
communication: "One is the pure information side. We buy data bases and have 
resource people putting them on-line. If a magazine did an excellent piece on 
breast cancer and you want it six months later, it will be in the data base." 
</P>
<P>
 But where women get the greatest value, she thinks, is in interaction. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the feedback Pack and Rhine have been getting since October, when they 
opened Women's Wire to 300 founding subscribers for a three-month trial period. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "People are helping each other get through all sorts of situations," says 
Pack. "A woman recently signed onto the forum devoted to children and said her 
daughter had been diagnosed with severe learning disabilities and she didn't 
know how to cope. She heard from other mothers who suggested groups to work 
with, recommended special schools and told her how they had dealt with similar 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Some have described this process as "electronic consciousness-raising," but 
Pack likes to call it an "electronic community," with women exchanging 
experience in everything from home repairs to menopause. "The amount of support 
you see on the network is incredible," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she's used a PC since college, Pack doesn't consider herself any sort 
of computer wizard. But when she moved to Palo Alto in 1992 as chief operating 
officer for a software company, she discovered the Well, a regional on-line 
system with about 10,000 members who network on everything from finding 
relationships to discussing the state of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Pack found the network helpful in getting acquainted with interesting people 
("I even found a doctor on-line") and also noticed that most of the users were 
men. So she posted a note on the Well about starting a women's computer network 
and met Rhine. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhine spent the 1970s at a Tennessee commune, where she helped computerize a 
data base for the Midwife's Assn. of North America. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually she acquired a PC and moved to rural Northern California where she 
launched a word processing business and began educating herself in software. 
</P>
<P>
 "The computer allowed me, as a single parent, to work and be available to my 
children at the same time," says Rhine, the mother of two teen-agers. "I've 
always seen its value as a timesaver." 
</P>
<P>
 When she later moved to the Bay Area, she got a job on the Well designing a 
customer support function and she was hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could quickly see the power of the communications tool," she says. "During 
the uprising in China's Tian An Men Square, there was a man on the Well whose 
son was in China and they were talking regularly. The son used to send reports 
of what was happening at that very moment. To me it was revolutionary -- a way 
to get around governments and the limitations of the press." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Pack, she is concerned because, although women are major workplace users 
of computers for data processing, they are being left behind in the real 
communications revolution -- on-line networking.  
</P>
<P>
 Their concern is shared by Judith Broadhurst, a New York writer who 
specializes in women and technology. "I don't think women yet understand what 
on-line computing can do for them," says Broadhurst. "I think they misperceive 
what it's all about. Men tend to be more curious about how computers work." 
</P>
<P>
 For Pack and Rhine, the first goal was to create a system that would be 
user-friendly in all aspects. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want it to be a technical challenge," says Pack. "We tried to 
organize the information logically and simply. We are heavy on customer service 
and support. We take calls all the time from people who don't have modems, but 
want to know what they are." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a world at your fingertips," says Aliza Sherman, a New Yorker who 
subscribed to Women's Wire in December. She had just switched careers -- from 
the music industry to a nonprofit group called the Domestic Abuse Awareness 
Project -- and was looking for networking. 
</P>
<P>
 She signs on every day, calling up everything from news headlines to Usenet 
discussions, she said. Her domestic abuse project, with its mission statement 
and most recent newsletter, is available in Women's Wire directory of 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "One subscriber, who read about us wants to have lunch and may even fund us," 
Sherman says. With a current membership of about 500, Women's Wire is a small 
player in a competitive game, but Pack and Rhine have high ambitions and think 
their focus gives them an edge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our hope," says Pack, "is that in five years Women's Wire will be a great 
global clearing house for information that will focus on communications and 
needs of women around the world."

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; INDECISIVE MOMENT MAKES FOR A TERRIFYING ORDEAL; KISS OF 
THE WOLF BY JIM SHEPARD ; HARCOURT BRACE, $19.95, 263 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER, TIMES BOOK CRITIC

<TEXT>
<P>
 In shock when her husband walks out with no more explanation than a scrawled 
note tucked under the telephone, Joanie Mucherino lives in the bell jar of 
depression: nothing but white noise and white silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Her high school students pity her; on the other hand, a friend once told her 
that people are responsible for the bad things that happen to them. Twelve 
years of marriage have reduced her world to her job, her 11-year-old son, her 
relatives and a neighbor or two. She goes through her address book: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a pretty sight. Whole letters of the alphabet are empty. Not just 
Q's and X's either. Where're the F's? Where're the J's? I don't know anyone 
whose name begins with J? Some letters have, like, on a whole page, one uncle 
listed." 
</P>
<P>
 With her sense of herself so shaken, her sense of self-preservation is also 
shaken. She half-welcomes the flamboyant attentions of Bruno, a self-proclaimed 
tough guy who has been after her for years. Her driving has turned fast and 
sloppy. One night, speeding home from a family confirmation party for Todd, her 
son, she hits a man walking on the road and kills him. She dithers; then, 
despite Todd's pleas for her to call the police, she drives home and says 
nothing. It is not really a decision; it is a depressive inability to make a 
decision: 
</P>
<P>
 "What frightened her most was her inability to picture the terrible things 
ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 At this point in Jim Shepard's new novel, we are prepared for twists of 
character and event -- remorse, discovery, an expiation ranging from inner 
torment to actual punishment, and possibly some form of growth -- that fit 
within the quiet serio-comic realism of his characters' voices and of their 
Italian-American working-class setting. 
</P>
<P>
 What we get is something quite different. "Kiss of the Wolf's" low-keyed, 
finely tuned machinery begins to rev up ominously through mounting suspense and 
into a crashing, melodramatic finale. 
</P>
<P>
 The accelerator is Bruno. We see him -- as we do Joanie, Todd and Joanie's 
mother, Nina -- sometimes in his own first-person account and sometimes through 
the eyes of another character. 
</P>
<P>
 He makes his first appearance at the confirmation party, a thoroughly 
dispirited affair where everyone is trying to overcome their dismay at the 
breakup of Joanie's marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruno, by contrast, is all exuberance. He is awkward, jovial, loud. The party 
needs his energy, but there is something wrong with it. He takes up all the 
room and his own clangor isolates him. "Bacigalupe" -- wolf's kiss -- is Nina's 
contemptuous nickname for him. 
</P>
<P>
 The nickname darkens. The dead man, somewhat too coincidentally, turns out to 
be a friend of Bruno's. Not only a friend, in fact, but an associate in a 
Mafia-backed venture. An envelope full of money is missing. Bruno vows he will 
find the hit-and-run driver; not just out of friendship but because otherwise 
he himself may very well end up dead. At the same time, he resumes his pursuit 
of Joanie, showing special warmth not only to her but to Todd. 
</P>
<P>
 For Joanie, frozen in guilt and numbly reproached by Todd for her concealment, 
Bruno's attentions hold an alarming ambiguity. He is ponderously affectionate 
but there is a whiff of menace as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Does he suspect her or is it simply a part of the dangerousness he prides 
himself in? Is he wooing her or trapping her? It is not just a question for 
Joanie. Shepard, author of "Lights Off in the Reptile House," is a skillful and 
powerful writer, and almost until the end Joanie's question and her terrified 
uncertainty are largely the reader's, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Shepard evokes the claustrophobia and isolation of her silence and, more 
touchingly, the torment of her son whom she has imprisoned in it. In Bruno he 
portrays a man whose image of himself oscillates, sometimes engagingly and 
sometimes spookily, between self-knowledge and delusion.  
</P>
<P>
 "Kiss of the Wolf" is an uneven effort. There is some artificiality in the 
setting-up of Joanie's terror, and Shepard's buildup can be creaky. The terror 
itself, and its awful constriction, on the other hand, are utterly convincing. 
</P>
<P>
 Joanie's dealings with her family -- particularly with her mother -- are 
wittily and perceptively written, though television sitcoms have cast a 
preemptive shadow over domestic comedy that Shepard does not entirely escape. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the finale, its actual violence is much inferior to the implied 
violence that had held us until then. Like fictional sex, fictional mayhem is 
usually more convincing when suggested than when spelled out.

THEATER REVIEW; FATE DOOMS AMATEURS IN LORCA'S LYRICAL 'BLOOD WEDDING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Consider this a warning to audiences and artists alike: Beware "Blood 
Wedding." 
</P>
<P>
 Federico Garcia Lorca's three-act tragedy in verse and song is deeply obsessed 
with mortality, yet fluid and lyrical as (to borrow a Lorca-ism) the wind. But 
the early 20th Century master of Spanish theater wrote sprawling works so 
thoroughly fixed in his native land that there's nothing for a director to toy 
with. 
</P>
<P>
 At Orange Coast College, Bryan Prince's staging with the school's repertory 
company in the cramped Drama Lab Studio is at best an act of love, at worst a 
student experiment that might best have been served by not going public. 
</P>
<P>
 There are outlines here of a faint awareness of Lorca's world of fates, of 
language drenched in metaphor and imagery, of impossible social bonds. And 
Prince wisely avoids any director's statements. But this is an especially 
painful case of theater-in-training. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the tale of a bride (Nectar Rose) and groom (Daniel Balcazar) torn apart 
by a former flame, Leonardo (Isaac Christopher); all of them are fated for 
tragedy by an old blood feud, and there's a solemnity here completely alien to 
American sensibilities. It's no wonder American companies rarely succeed with 
"Blood Wedding." 
</P>
<P>
 No one ever said this is easy, even for the finest professional classical 
troupes. The central problem at OCC lies with actors trained in naturalistic 
style having to adapt to Lorca's deliberately artificial archetypes, complex 
verse and chant-like songs. This is drama much closer to ancient Greek tragedy 
than to any modern American tragedy, and Prince's cast appears to be in 
uncharted waters. For the most part, in a work so infused with emotions that it 
reportedly triggered suicides during its first Madrid performances, the 
emotional level is as flat as the vocal delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are those valiant few who rise above the sensibility of a nervy 
exercise. Christina Rabano as the bridegroom's mother seems truly weighted down 
by the ghosts of family feuds, and Rose suggests genuine torn emotions as she 
runs off with Leonardo on her wedding day. The men are sadly uninvolved, 
unconvincing or both, and much of the singing (except by young Corinne Hart and 
Megan Rank) is fairly unlistenable. Too bad, because Lorca is, above all, a 
playwright for the ear. 
</P>
<P>

Costa Mesa. Friday-Saturday, 8 p.m.; Sunday, 3 p.m.. Ends Sunday. $5-$6. (714)

JAZZ REVIEW; HARDBOP QUINTET BRINGS NEW YORK EDGE TO L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a step upward from local trios to larger groups from out of town, the Club 
Brasserie at the Bel Age Hotel in West Hollywood hit just the right chord 
Tuesday with a New York band known as the HardBop Quintet. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by the eclectically excellent pianist Keith Saunders, this enthusiastic 
unit is precisely what its name implies, conjuring up images of an idiom that 
flourished in the 1960s and has never really gone away. 
</P>
<P>
 The front-line sound is one that was long associated with groups led by Art 
Blakey and Horace Silver: trumpet and tenor sax, playing themes in unison and 
occasional harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 Every man in the band is a writer. Bud Powell's fascinatingly eerie "Un Poco 
Loco" was arranged by the drummer, Eddie Ornowski; Jerry Weldon, the tenor 
saxophonist, whose sound is muscularly engaging, wrote "Leroy Street." Gordon 
Jenkins' elegiac "Goodbye" is a chart by bassist Bim Strasberg, and Saunders 
himself contributed "99-9," with a tenor solo that was fluid drive incarnate. 
</P>
<P>
 With trumpeter Joe Magnarelli (best known for his work in Toshiko Akiyoshi's 
band) as a fleet and fiery partner for Weldon, this group stands out whether 
playing one of its own creations or bringing back half-forgotten pop songs such 
as "How Little We Know." One can only hope that this auspicious debut will 
result in a swift return booking. 
</P>
<P>
 The HardBop Quintet will play at Jax in Glendale on Friday and Saturday 
nights, and Pedrini Music in Alhambra on Saturday afternoon. LEONARD FEATHER

POP MUSIC REVIEW; JOHN SIMON GIVES A NOD TO TIN PAN ALLEY IN SOLO SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a record producer, John Simon is probably best known for nursing the 
American-baroque eccentricities of the Band's first albums. In his own 
charmingly eccentric solo show at the Largo on Tuesday, he showed in his own 
music an allegiance to that ultimate bastion of baroque Americana -- Tin Pan 
Alley. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone expecting music like the Band's might have been disappointed. Simon's 
casual, cabaret approach is really more the stuff of Manhattan hotel lounges 
than the rock 'n' roll roadhouses that shaped the Band.  
</P>
<P>
 Standing at an electronic keyboard or seated at an upright piano, freed by a 
headset-microphone to sway and bop as he sang, Simon seemed as if he were 
entertaining guests at his home. Songs long on warmth, whimsy and wit, if short 
on invention, brought to mind David Frishberg ("crossed with Mr. Rogers," noted 
one observer) and to a lesser extent, Randy Newman, Tom Lehrer, Jimmy Webb and 
Van Dyke Parks.  
</P>
<P>
 Simon came off a bit dilettantish as a performer (his latest album, "Out on 
the Street," is his first in more than 20 years), but his spirit was winning. 
Give this guy a piano bar somewhere and let him loose. STEVE HOCHMAN

DANCE REVIEW; 'FLAMENCO' STRETCHES BOUNDARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Flamenco has always been a world unto itself, so it's news when artists of 
great technical and stylistic authority stretch beyond its limits to 
incorporate outside traditions. In their "Flamenco Fusion" program at the 
Fountain Theatre on Tuesday, guitarist Adam del Monte and dancer Laila del 
Monte did just that, layering jazz, Middle Eastern and Western European Gypsy 
influences without blurring their powerful flamenco impetus. 
</P>
<P>
 Impressive enough in duets with flamenco singers Antonio de Jerez and Marisol 
Fuentes, the playing of Adam del Monte achieved a special mastery in a Tarantas 
full of moody alternations between emotional turbulence and rapid filigree, a 
Bulerias compelling for the rhythmic sophistication of its jazz-tinged 
scamperings and a performance of Albeniz's "Cordoba" ravishing in its heartfelt 
simplicity and rich tone. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Wagner's percussion (including drums from India) and Rick Rossi's flute 
enriched the dance segments, during which unorthodox rhythms of 11/8 and 17/8 
developed by the Del Montes gave flamenco heel work a distinctive new edge. 
</P>
<P>
 In her first solo (Solea por Bulerias y "Laileria"), Laila del Monte 
contrasted explosions of intense heel work with silent stalking steps (arms 
coiling overhead) and sculptural poses infused with feeling. The taut flamenco 
silhouette became softened by Middle Eastern sensuality here -- especially in 
the upper arms and shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 Both gutsy in attack and mysterious in its unyielding inner concentration, her 
Seguiriyas proved stark in its effects up to the spectacular physical flourish 
at the end. In contrast, the concluding "De Jerez a Calcutta" found her 
embodying a mercurial free spirit -- one that initially appeared barefoot but 
later returned in heeled shoes for joyous rhythmic interplay with the musicians 
and interaction with members of her wildly enthusiastic audience. LEWIS SEGAL

ART REVIEWS; TAKING A GLIMPSE INTO 'THE WORLD OF TOMORROW' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The World of Tomorrow" is a superbly installed and impeccably selected 
13-artist exhibition at Thomas Solomon's Garage. Curated by New York writer 
Douglas Blau, the show's hauntingly beautiful landscapes and cityscapes give 
solid shape to a remarkably refined, accessible and generous curatorial 
sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the movie "Back to the Future," Blau's arrangement of photographs, 
paintings, drawings and prints freely traverses past and present, suggesting 
that each moment of time embodies multiple realities. In this quiet, thoughtful 
show, powerful memories drift in and out of focus alongside the hopes and fears 
that accompany the future's unfolding. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a pleasure to move from the strange, soft-focus clarity of Uta Barth's 
Ektacolor photograph of the Bonaventure Hotel to the saturated glow of a 
gorgeously poisonous sunset in Robert Yarber's photo of a gas station. A shadow 
of melancholy is cast over culture's transitory nature by Oliver Wasow's 
Cibachrome print of a solitary tree presiding over a shimmering, seemingly 
underwater city, and Barbara Ess' pinhole rendition of a derelict Neo-classical 
facade. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Majore's slick "Ellis Island" dresses up America as an irrepressible 
fantasy of luxury and wealth, while a mute drawing of abandoned Detroit 
skyscrapers by Michelle Zalopany strips down reality to dreams gone sour. The 
eternal city of Rome is transformed into a precious souvenir in Judy Fiskin's 
tiny keyhole picture. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the images in "The World of Tomorrow" depict people. Although our 
impact is amply evident, the show leaves the impression that our future role is 
indeterminate and tentative. We get the feeling we've been momentarily cast 
adrift in a world free of other people, left alone to follow whims and personal 
associations. 
</P>
<P>
 Blau's poetic vision is refreshingly out of step with current art-world 
trends. In an overly critical era, he willingly entertains the possibility that 
pictorial seduction is more than mere manipulation. Unabashedly romantic, "The 
World of Tomorrow" hints that the time has come when intelligence no longer 
requires austere moral messages, and that it should no longer be embarrassing 
to take pleasure in art.

 In-Your-Face Recycling: At the height of the Vietnam War, Robert Heinecken 
altered a handful of Time magazines and put them back on the rack of a Los 
Angeles newsstand, keeping a few copies for himself. At Linda Cathcart Gallery, 
these remaining rarely seen and little known pieces of cultural sabotage are 
displayed with about two dozen other superimposed, surgically cut-up and 
pointedly reconfigured issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Each page of Heinecken's fake magazine from 1968 was printed over a news photo 
of a Vietnamese soldier holding two decapitated heads. Heinecken's in-your-face 
recycling of atrocity goes to the heart of the debate about whether the mass 
media numbs us to horror or sparks action.  
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the '70s, Heinecken made collages of various popular publications, 
sometimes seamlessly piecing together an entire magazine with nothing but 
advertisements for cigarettes and liquor, or only food. 
</P>
<P>
 A few issues in which he juxtaposed hard-core porn with articles intended to 
inform teens about puberty and dating strike a sensitive social nerve. At once 
hilarious and distressing, these incisive works prod society's unsavory 
underbelly. 
</P>

 An altered 1989 Kodak-sponsored special issue of Time celebrating 150 years of 
photo-journalism is Heinecken's editing masterpiece. By cutting away precise 
portions of each page, he peels away the slick surfaces of the news to suggest 
that everyday reality is a vicious conspiracy.

 A Foot on Multiculturalism: Portentous self-pity swamps John Mandell's 
lugubrious sound and slide installation at the Santa Monica Museum of Art. 
Intentionally overblown and hollow, "Opera of Blame" struggles to balance 
heavy-duty existential dread against ironic self-mockery, but sinks under the 
weight of its own bombast. 
</P>
<P>
 In a dark, cavernous gallery, the text of a gloomy poem is projected on a 
wall. On another wall, the filmed image of a jaded businessman intermittently 
appears, usually accompanied by a musical fanfare. A framed wall label proposes 
that the dour businessman is a 40-story buoy that lurches around the Pacific 
Rim, threatening ships and beaches like a mutant, unmoored Statue of Liberty. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandell's Angst -laden poem recalls Walt Whitman's "Song of Myself." The 
wildly optimistic, radically democratic 19th-Century poet delighted in finding 
connections between his innermost self and all inhabitants of his country. 
</P>
<P>
 The narrator of Mandell's suffocating poem, however, is utterly disgusted by 
the pandemonium of his diverse neighbors. Although we're meant to read this as 
a mockery of patriarchal single-mindedness, its humor is too thin and bitter to 
be effective. The installation is a pitiful dirge for outdated ideas, which are 
not dying of natural causes but are being contested by other artists with more 
vital approaches and styles. 
</P>
<P>
 The specter of multiculturalism haunts Mandell's foray into theater. His 
sarcastic installation puts one foot on the multicultural bandwagon while 
keeping the other stubbornly grounded in old ideas. In the end, it gets trapped 
between insincere humility and desperate vainglory.

 Unlike Diebenkorn: Awkwardness and ugliness toughen John Millei's unwieldy 
paintings on vellum. At Ace Gallery, traditional notions of painterly beauty 
are thrown out of sync by muddled smears of oil, improper compositions, 
blacked-out halves and tasteless color combinations. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than detract from Millei's powers as an agile handler of paint, 
however, the improprieties of his new, anti-gestural abstractions charge them 
with a jolt of dissonant energy.  
</P>
<P>
 Millei is often compared to the late Richard Diebenkorn. However, if he 
belongs to a respectable lineage of modern painters, his more perverse pedigree 
would includes Albert Oehlen's anxious abstractions; Sigmar Polke's cunning 
ridicule of commercial culture; Andy Warhol's chilling expressions of 
alienation, and Jasper Johns' uneasy fixation on the violent erasure of shared 
symbols in American abstract art. Millei's distance from the precedent of 
Diebenkorn has never been more plain than in these recent paintings.

SAN JOAQUIN FARMERS PROTEST PLANNED WATER CUTBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Farmers on tractors and workers with signs pleading for jobs paraded to a 
hearing where they protested proposed water cutbacks aimed at saving fish and 
enhancing the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs with slogans such as "I Want Work, not Welfare" and "Without Water, We 
Perish" showed the agribusiness community's concern over proposed cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Three U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
officials conducted the hearing on proposed diversions of water that 
traditionally have gone to farms and cities south of the delta. Under the 
proposal, hundreds of thousands of acre-feet would be kept in the delta to help 
water quality, the delta smelt and the Sacramento splittail, a type of minnow. 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers said sharp cutbacks in the amount of federal water available for San 
Joaquin Valley farms would translate into idle land and lost jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "People marched many blocks making the point we are talking about jobs, about 
the future of the valley," state Sen. Phil Wyman (R-Bakersfield) told the 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendota Councilman Robert Rasmussen said unemployment in his western Fresno 
County community of 4,800 residents has hit 40% because of irrigation water 
cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Cove Mayor Victor Lopez said his eastern Fresno County city, "Can't 
afford to lose the jobs that we have. Take it back to the president, Congress, 
the Senate that fish have never voted." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Bill Jones (R-Fresno) said environmentalists have vilified dams 
and irrigation facilities "as destroyers of the environment. But without those 
facilities, there would have been no delta smelt as we went through one of the 
worst droughts in history." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones asked the federal officials to "give us the consideration that the 
largest state in the union and the largest agriculture community in the world 
deserves." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Frick, president of Arvin-Edison Water Storage District in Kern County, 
said there is no proof the delta proposals will help fish, but "we know they 
will have a devastating effect on the economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Kerman grape grower Phil Larson, who organized the demonstration for the 
Fresno County Farm Bureau called on federal officials to come up with "a 
balanced approach to restoration of the delta. We want to be included in it, 
not excluded from it."

SNOWSTORM SNARLS AIRLINE TRAVEL, CAUSES OUTAGES IN CENTRAL PLAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Blowing snow snarled airline schedules Wednesday as the latest in a series of 
winter storms whistled from the central Plains into New England, causing power 
outages and traffic accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're not canceled you're going to be delayed.It's not pleasant," said 
Chicago aviation department spokeswoman Lisa Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Aviation Administration ordered airlines to cut arrivals and 
departures at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport by two-thirds because of 
blowing snow and poor visibility. 
</P>
<P>
 New York City's airports reported scattered delays. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm that already had dumped more than a foot of snow on Nebraska brought 
up to 15 inches Wednesday to southern Wisconsin and 11 inches to northern 
Illinois. In the Northeast, up to a foot of snow was forecast in Connecticut 
and Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow and ice downed power lines in central Illinois, and nearly the entire 
city of Springfield lost electricity during the night. 
</P>
<P>
 In Nebraska, three tractor-trailer rigs and numerous cars were involved in an 
accident that blocked traffic on Interstate 80 between Omaha and Lincoln.

DEREK JARMAN; CRITICALLY PRAISED BRITISH FILMMAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Derek Jarman, the iconoclastic enfant terrible of low-budget British 
filmmaking who matured to earn international critical praise and peer respect, 
has died in London. He was 52. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarman, who was outspoken about his own and others' homosexuality, died 
Saturday of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 He had gone public with the news that he was HIV-positive in 1987, and his 
last project, a film titled "Blue" to be shown on British television next fall, 
details his experience with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a World War II bomber pilot who ran Rome's airport after the war, 
Jarman spent part of his childhood in Italy where he was influenced by Italian 
filmmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 He studied at Slade School of Fine Art and began his career as a painter and a 
set and costume designer for ballet and opera. He moved into film by designing 
sets for director Ken Russell's "The Devils" in 1971 and "Savage Messiah" in 
1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarman began making his own films in the 1970s, often stressing homosexual 
themes and priding himself on low-budget, non-mainstream work. His films best 
known to California audiences include "Sebastiane" in 1976, "The Tempest" in 
1979, "Caravaggio" in 1986, "War Requiem" in 1989 and "Edward II" in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 His other films include "Jubilee" in 1978, "Imagining October" in 1984, "The 
Last of England" in 1986 and "The Garden" in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really want to make big feature films or use big feature actors," 
Jarman told The Times in 1979. "I like to have people around me I know and 
trust. I know how they move, how they work. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I get into that $5-million stuff all the fun will go out of it," Jarman 
said. "I see myself as very much on the fringe. I want to make small films 
happily." 
</P>
<P>
 When Jarman's interpretation of Shakespeare's "The Tempest" opened at the 
Vista Hollywood in 1981, Times film critic Kevin Thomas evaluated it simply as 
"the pits." 
</P>
<P>
 "What's unforgivable about 'The Tempest,' " Thomas wrote, "is not that it's a 
travesty but simply that it's such a pretentious, bloody bore." 
</P>
<P>
 But what a difference a decade made. When "War Requiem" hit the local screen 
in 1990, Thomas greeted it as "a remarkably evocative and powerful film (by) 
England's premier experimentalist." 
</P>
<P>
 The critic called the film "evidence of a new maturity in a onetime enfant 
terrible who once was more likely to drive you up the wall -- or up the aisle 
-- than to move you with his commanding sense of the visual." 
</P>
<P>
 A noted author as well as director, Jarman sparked controversy in 1991 when he 
wrote a letter in the Guardian newspaper criticizing Shakespearean actor Ian 
McKellen for accepting a knighthood. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a queer artist," Jarman wrote, "I find it impossible to react with 
anything but dismay to his acceptance of the honor from a government which has 
stigmatized homosexuality. . . . I think it's a co-option." 
</P>
<P>
 Jarman's books include "Dancing Ledge," "The Last of England," and two 
memoirs, "Modern Nature" and "At Your Own Risk."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FREEWAY WIDENING OPEN HOUSE IS TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Open houses dealing with the widening of the Santa Ana Freeway through areas 
of North County have been scheduled this week and in April by Caltrans and the 
Orange County Transportation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The first one will be held at 6 tonight at the Buena Park Recreation and 
Community Center, 8150 Knott Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimate design and right-of-way maps for the freeway widening starting half a 
mile north of La Palma Avenue to Beach Boulevard will be displayed, and a 
12-minute video also will be available. Staff from the California Department of 
Transportation will be on hand.  
</P>
<P>
 The second open house will be at 6 p.m. April 28 at Anaheim's City Hall West, 
201 S. Anaheim Blvd. Widening segments to be discussed include the one from 
Broadway to Crescent Avenue, and Crescent Avenue to half a mile north of Haster 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a hot line has been created to handle reports of problems with 
vacated properties along the rights of way. The number is (714) 756-7639.

SHOTS FIRED -- OFFICERS DOWN; WHY MORE AND MORE CHIEFS OF POLICE WEEP AT THE 
FUNERALS OF THEIR COLLEAGUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hours after the funeral of two Palos Verdes police officers, Capt. Michael 
Wayne Tracy and Sgt. Vernon Thomas Vanderpool, who were shot dead by a gunman 
who burst into a meeting room, a rookie LAPD officer, Christy Hamilton, was 
fatally shot in the chest as she got out of her cruiser Tuesday in the San 
Fernando Valley. Last weekend, a Culver City police officer was shot in the 
neck and barely escaped death. And two unarmed security guards, Dagoberto 
Carrero and Rupert Morales, were shot and killed in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 We look for reasons for these tragedies that have come so numbingly, in so few 
days. There's a seeming jump in the rapacity of criminals, which can render 
every call that the police make a life-threatening one. And police are not only 
outgunned but outmanned -- fighting too much crime on too many fronts. That 
they succeed as they do is a tribute to their hard work and courage. 
</P>
<P>
 But certainly a major factor, as any police officer will tell you, is the 
pervasiveness of guns. The slain officers and guards weren't stabbed or beaten 
or poisoned. They were shot, just as all nine Southern California officers 
killed in the line of duty in the past year were shot, too often with weapons 
more powerful than police have -- weapons that just should not be in public 
hands, because from law-abiding and careful hands they slip into criminal 
hands. It is the awful risk guns pose to officers that has prompted chiefs of 
police across the nation to endorse varying degrees of additional gun control. 
They see the carnage clearly, and weep at the funerals of their colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 There are plenty of gun-control measures under consideration in Sacramento, 
but none of them is going anywhere. These include a comprehensive handgun ban, 
for which retiring Assembly member Terry B. Friedman (D-Brentwood) has found 
but four colleagues brave enough to co-sign, and several lesser measures, 
including one by Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), whose bill calls for 
licensing of handgun owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The police simply cannot be society's shield against bullets. Every time an 
officer is killed, it reinforces the us-against-them, thin-blue-line mentality 
that divides police from the people they protect. This can breed the very 
abuses that police reformers then attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Building more prisons and increasing prison sentences might help in the long 
term. But public protection would be better served, more quickly, by 
prevention, including putting more police on the street. President Clinton 
talked about Hamilton's death Wednesday in calling for action on his crime 
bill, which funds more police. That's fine, but it is the wise public view, 
reflected in every poll, that America needs more rather than less gun control. 
Legislators must hear this message and stand up to the gun-lobby backlash.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; MOVING FAST TO FIGHT TB'S CONTAGION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Health Care Agency has demonstrated a valuable quality in a 
public institution -- a willingness to learn from mistakes.  
</P>
<P>
 It asked federal and state health officials to critique the agency's handling 
of a tuberculosis outbreak at La Quinta High School in Westminster last 
year.The review faulted the county for not being aggressive enough in 
combatting the outbreak, and county health workers agreed with the criticism 
and tightened procedures, as they should. 
</P>
<P>
 The Health Care Agency said it learned in June, 1992, that a La Quinta student 
had tuberculosis. Two private doctors treated her and assured officials that 
she was not contagious, the county said. The county now acknowledges that it 
waited too long, nearly a year, before taking over treatment of the student. By 
then she was thought to have infected 12 classmates with the disease, typically 
spread by coughing or sneezing. The county also took months to test other La 
Quinta students. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrast that with last month's much better response when health officials 
learned that a Fullerton preschool worker had a contagious form of 
tuberculosis. The county quickly notified parents that children might have been 
exposed. Health Care Agency officials showed that they learned the importance 
of closely monitoring outbreaks of a disease unfortunately again on the rise.

DIVISIONS I AND II; BUENA BEATS CAPISTRANO VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Capistrano Valley Coach Pete Belanto watched two tapes of top-seeded Ventura 
Buena before his team lost to the Bulldogs, 51-37, in a Southern Section 
Division I-A girls' basketball quarterfinals Wednesday at Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are all talent," Belanto said."(Coach Joe Vaughan) hasn't got 450 wins 
without some talent." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs showed some of that talent, making few mistakes and hitting shots 
from all over the court, including 10 of 12 from the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley (14-14) kept it close in the first half, down 25-18 and 
outrebounding Buena, 13-11. Jennifer Garrett had seven boards at the half, 
finishing with 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we played better than them," Belanto said. "Jen got a lot of 
rebounds, but she couldn't put them back in." 
</P>
<P>
 The third quarter was all Buena (22-2). The Bulldogs put on the pressure, 
causing four consecutive Cougar turnovers and sparking a 14-2 run ending the 
third quarter up 42-24. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Scott, who has led Capistrano Valley in the playoffs averaging 26 
points, was held to 10, only one in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Katie Scott led the Cougars with 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are a great team, nobody is going to beat them," Belanto said. "It was 
no disgrace losing to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Giordano had a game-high 21 points for Buena. MELANIE NEFF

DIVISIONS IV AND V; COSTA MESA GETS A SCARE BEFORE DEFEATING SACRED HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Costa Mesa came about as close as it would like to elimination in a Southern 
Section Division IV-AA girls' basketball quarterfinal game Wednesday at Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs, trailing 35-20 early in the second half, put together a furious 
run and beat La Canada Flintridge Sacred Heart, 46-42. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of let them have it halftime," Costa Mesa Coach Lisa McNamee said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs, defending Division III-A champions, will play Santa Ynez, the 
second-seed Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa trailed at halftime, 25-18, thanks to the Tologs' Liz Doyd, who had 
13 points and 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacred Heart opened the third quarter with a 10-2 run before Costa Mesa 
countered with a 18-4 run, closing to within one, at 39-38, entering the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked at the half about moving the ball up the court," McNamee said. 
"That's what we need to do and we got away from that when Heather (Robinson) 
was on the bench." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson led the Mustangs' second-half charge with seven points and finished 
with 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth quarter was slow-paced. Costa Mesa took the lead for good with 4 
minutes 36 seconds remaining when Tracy Vega converted a baseline jumper to 
give the Mustangs a 42-41 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson increased the lead seconds later with a jump shot, and Doan Do put 
the game away with a pair of free throws with 12 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "We picked up our defense in the fourth quarter," McNamee said. "They 
committed some turnovers trying to go inside to Doyd and we tried to run our 
plays more methodically." 
</P>
<P>
 Doyd was held to eight points and three rebounds in the second half. She 
finished with a game-high 21 points and 16 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 For Costa Mesa, Do finished with 11 points and seven rebounds. PETER BARZILAI

DIVISION II; TROY SCORES FASHIONABLE VICTORY OVER CANYON, 46-30 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Troy's girls thought their coach, Brad Sand, was a sloppy dresser, so they 
bought him a tie and insisted he wear it. They went for the Daffy Duck 
basketball motif, and he wore it for the Warriors' first Freeway League game in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 That was 12 victories ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Now known as "the lucky tie," Sand was dressed for success Wednesday night, 
and Troy turned Canyon daffy in the fourth quarter of a 46-30 second-round 
Southern Section Division II-A playoff victory, running its winning streak to a 
school-record 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors (20-5) are moving on to the quarterfinals for the second 
consecutive year after having never been this deep in the playoffs. They'll 
face second-seeded Cypress Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Their victory over the Comanches (15-10) was ugly at best, but even Mr. 
Blackwell would appreciate a victory in which a girl named Bloomingdale sparked 
the Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy led after each quarter, 10-7, 21-18 and 28-27. But it was an 18-foot shot 
by Stephanie Bloomingdale with 5 minutes 50 seconds left that seemed to get the 
Warriors going. Her basket with one second left on the shot clock -- she had 
attempted only one field to that point -- began a 7-0 run in which Troy 
stretched its lead from 32-28 to 39-28. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's our shooting guard, and when that happened, it seemed like things 
started going for us," Sand said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was part of a quarter in which Troy outscored Canyon, 18-3. The Comanches 
were zero of 12 shooting and their youth showed. They started three juniors and 
two sophomores, and as their season ticked away, it was apparent no one wanted 
to take the open three-point shots that might bring them back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was just our inexperience," first-year Canyon Coach Nelson Herrera 
said. "We missed a lot of easy shots and we had a hard time dealing with 
pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Audra Gamst led Troy with 13 points, and Jennie Gadd had 10 points and 13 
rebounds -- seven points and 11 rebounds in the second half. Dinah Shah was six 
of six from the line in the fourth quarter and finished with 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "The girl in the middle (6-foot-3 Gadd) was tough to match up with," Herrera 
said, "but the difference was the point guard (Shah). She passed well and broke 
our defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Sarah Spjut and junior Robynn Kuhlmann each scored nine points for 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuhlmann, their leading scorer, didn't play the first quarter but Spjut picked 
up the slack with seven first-quarter points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors would clearly like to put the Canyon victory behind them and play 
Cypress the way it played Compton Dominguez in the first round. Despite their 
underdog role in that game -- Dominguez was the third-place team from a tough 
league -- the Warriors played four strong quarters. Against Canyon, they were 
sharp only in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every coach I talked to said, 'I can't believe you got Dominguez; they're 
big, fast, aggressive and they run you all night long,' " Sand said. "I'll take 
that game over this game. It wasn't for lack of trying, but today it just 
wasn't getting done." 
</P>
<P>
 In another Division II-A game: 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Hills Alemany 61, Valencia 30 -- Carly Funicello, with 20 points, and 
Samantha Rigley, with 18 points, helped top-seeded Alemany roll over Valencia 
(13-10). Sandy Sarmiento had nine points for the Tigers. Alemany is 25-0.

DIVISION III-AA; SAILORS GET EASY VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Genevieve Evarts and Gina Heads wiped their faces and walked to the sideline 
slowly as they had so many times before. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, however, things were different. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Harbor High senior guards had played their final home game, and 
Sailor Coach Shannon Jakosky was not going to let the moment go unnoticed. 
Jakosky grabbed her charges before they reached the bench and embraced them as 
their fans applauded. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a picturesque ending to a picture-perfect game for Newport Harbor, 
which routed visiting El Dorado, 59-32, Wednesday night in the quarterfinals of 
the Southern Section Division III-AA girls' basketball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors (21-6) advanced to their third consecutive berth in the division 
semifinals. Newport Harbor will play Newbury Park Saturday night at a site to 
be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors, as usual, were led by their standout backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
 Evarts, the team's leading scorer with a 16-point average, scored a game-high 
19 points and Heads had 15 points and five steals. Their defense played a big 
part in the Sailors' limiting El Dorado to three points in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "My two seniors are something," Jakosky said of Evarts and Heads. "Those two 
young ladies have accomplished a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor led by 10 at halftime, 25-15, and was not challenged in the 
second half. The Sailors' lead grew to 39-21 with 2 minutes 50 seconds left in 
the third quarter on a layup by Melissa Schutz (12 points). Newport Harbor 
outscored El Dorado in the fourth quarter, 17-6. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our man defense really slowed them down," Heads said. "Shannon told us that 
would happen and it did." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Evarts: "This is so awesome. We want to go all the way this time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Hawks, who were second in the Empire League, finished the season 
18-8. 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado was hurt by center Shanna Renken's foul trouble. Renken, who 
committed three fouls in the first quarter, watched much of the game from the 
bench and scored only five points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started slow and we lost our best player real early," Golden Hawks Coach 
Gary Raya said. "It was just too much to overcome." 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Nebeker scored 12 points for the Golden Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
 In another Division III-AA game: 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda 85, Magnolia 15 -- The top-seeded Ladycats (27-0) led by 50 at 
halftime. Lee Moulin had a season-high five three-pointers and scored a 
game-high 17. Nicole Erickson had 16 for Brea-Olinda, which plays unseeded 
Torrance Bishop Montgomery in the semifinals Saturday.

CYPRESS EASILY HANDLES REDONDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cypress girls' basketball team defeated Redondo Beach Redondo Union, 
83-45, in a Southern Section Division II-A playoff game Wednesday at Cypress to 
advance to the quarterfinals for the fourth consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game started 20 minutes late because of a malfunctioning clock, the 
Centurions (25-3) quickly put their offense into high gear behind the trio of 
Jessica Eggleston, Julie Adams and Susan Flaming. Eggleston scored 38 points, 
26 in the first half, while Adams added 24 and Flaming 16 as Cypress 
overwhelmed the Seahawks (16-9). 
</P>
<P>
 The Centurions' full-court pressure worked to perfection, resulting in 
numerous turnovers that led to easy baskets. Cypress led, 25-11, after the 
first quarter. Eggleston and Adams controlled the boards, pulling down 13 and 
11, respectively.  
</P>
<P>
 Cypress had the game well in hand early in the second half, but Cypress fans 
were able to watch Flaming break the Orange County single-season assist record. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Her assist on Vivian Cheung's basket with 2 minutes 53 minutes left was her 
299th this season, breaking the record of Mission Viejo's Christie Wile, who 
had 298 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "My teammates deserve the credit for this record," Flaming said. "It's great 
playing with Jessica and Julie because they're two of the best finishers 
around. If one of them misses a shot, the other usually gets the rebound and 
puts it back in." 
</P>
<P>
 The trio has played together for three seasons. With Eggleston averaging 29.5 
points and Adams 17.3, it's easy to see who was on the receiving end of most of 
Flaming's assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "She does a great job of getting us the ball," Adams said. "Susan really 
deserves the record."  
</P>
<P>
 "It has been fun watching them improve each season," Cypress Coach John Selbe 
said. "They work together well. Now we'll see if we can get past the 
quarterfinals." 
</P>
<P>
 The Centurions will play Troy, a 46-30 winner over Canyon, Saturday at a site 
to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a good win for us," Eggleston said. "Hopefully, it will give us the 
momentum we'll need to keep going."

ON AN OFF NIGHT, BUENA WINS BY 14 IN QUARTERFINALS; HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL: 
TOP-SEEDED BULLDOG GIRLS GET HALFTIME LECTURE, GO THROUGH THE MOTIONS AND 
DEFEAT CAPISTRANO VALLEY, 51-37, IN DIVISION I-A PLAYOFF GAME. 
</P>

<P>
 The Buena High girls' basketball team's 51-37 beating of Capistrano Valley on 
Wednesday night was not a moral victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, it was a victory with a moral. 
</P>
<P>
 Get better, or else. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very hard to watch us play tonight, and very disheartening to me 
personally," Bulldog Coach Joe Vaughan said. "We will have to play a lot better 
on Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs (22-2) will face San Clemente, a 70-36 winner over Corona, 
Saturday in a Southern Section Division I-A semifinal. Buena is seeking its 
fifth consecutive championship-game appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Vaughan and his team felt any satisfaction from their quarterfinal 
defeat of the Cougars (14-14) at Capistrano Valley, they kept it well 
concealed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got yelled at at halftime, and after the game (Vaughan) said it was an 
embarrassing win," Bulldog guard Eboni Conley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you agree with him? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I do," she said. "It was one of our bad games." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs, ranked fourth in the state and seeded first in their division, 
wear Wedgwood blue uniforms  
</P>
<P>
 with thick black trim that are, well rather ugly. In the first half, their 
performance matched their togs. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior center Michelle Giordano scored 14 of her 21 points in the first half, 
but Buena's offense was sluggish and the team shot poorly. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley kept nipping at the Bulldogs' clunky black hightops and 
trailed by only 25-18 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars' twin sisters, senior forwards Katie (12 points) and Susan Scott 
(10), combined to score 13 points in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 But Buena's depth and talent finally won out during a 14-2 run midway through 
the third quarter that put the game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Bulldogs never quite got in synch. Even during a stretch when they 
stole the ball on three consecutive Cougar possessions, they missed two layups 
and came up with only a rebound basket. 
</P>
<P>
 "It scares me," said Conley, who had 10 points and eight rebounds. "And I know 
it scares some of the other players on the team." 
</P>
<P>
 But Giordano, a 6-foot-1 senior bound for Arizona, was not ready to sound the 
alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach isn't happy at all," she said. "But we'll just play better, win again, 
and make him happy." 
</P>
<P>
 So it goes for the defending champions.

LOW-OCTANE VENTURA OTORS ON; WOMEN'S BASKETBALL: PIRATES HELD TO SEASON-LOW IN 
POINTS BUT DEFEAT CITRUS ANYWAY, 50-34, IN FIRST ROUND OF REGIONAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe it was playoff jitters. Or perhaps it was good defense. But whatever the 
reason, it was not a game worth remembering for the Ventura College women's 
basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the Pirates defeated Citrus, 50-34, as expected in a first-round game of 
the Southern California regional Wednesday night at Ventura, but they had to 
fight for every shot. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura managed to hit the mark with more frequency than the Owls, 
especially from the free-throw line, and will advance to a second-round game at 
Saturday at Ventura against Cypress, a 77-73 winner over Trade Tech on 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Artistic it wasn't, but defensively it was a good game," Ventura Coach Ned 
Mircetic said. "The shots were hard to come by for both sides." 
</P>
<P>
 No question about that. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura (26-5), seeded No. 4 in the regional, made only 18 of 63 shots (28.5%) 
and Citrus (14-9) connected on 15 of 59 (25.4%). 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates, however, held a sizable edge in free throws, making 11 of 17 
(64.7%). Citrus converted only two of eight. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had good pressure on the ball," Mircetic said. "The refs let the game go 
but they let it go both ways." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fewest points scored by Ventura this season. The Pirates scored 51 
points in a game twice, once in a 52-51 loss to Oxnard in a Western State 
Conference North Division contest Feb. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Citrus, a team they defeated, 69-31, at the Cypress tournament in 
December, the Pirates jumped to a 7-0 lead and a 23-13 cushion at the half 
behind the shooting of forward Julie Hardy and guard Tara Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy, a freshman from Buena High, scored nine of her 20 points in the first 
half and Sanders, a sophomore from Santa Paula High, had eight of her 14 points 
in the quarter. Hardy also had 19 rebounds and eight steals. 
</P>
<P>
 She was particularly efficient during a 1 minute 30 second stretch in the 
second half, scoring seven unanswered points to give Ventura a 41-29 lead with 
seven minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Hardy's streak, the Owls had pulled to within 34-29, mostly on the 
scoring of center LaTaya Woods and guard Tamika Metcalf. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods led Citrus with 19 points and 21 rebounds, and Metcalf had nine points, 
all in the second half. Only one other Citrus player, Latricia Johnson (six 
points) scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the scoring by Woods came inside, usually while surrounded by Ventura 
defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Making her work hard to get the ball (in the low post) was a key," Mircetic 
said. "I think she got two freebies all night." 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Andrea Williams scored eight points for Ventura.

RESEDA GETS VICTORY IN FACE OF ADVERSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Reseda High trailed by 12 points early in the second quarter of its City 
Section 3-A playoff game with San Pedro Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting point guard Trenton Cross was sitting in the stands in street clothes 
with a cast on his left foot. Back-up point guard Damon Bailey was sitting on 
the bench with three fouls. And assistant coach Brad Katz had just been hit 
with a technical foul. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed an odd time for the top-seeded Regents to pick up their game, but 
pick it up they did, rebounding from a slow start and winning their first-round 
game over the Pirates, 82-67, at Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was played at Birmingham because Reseda's gym is still damaged from 
last month's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with a 28-16 deficit, Reseda Coach Jeff Halpern turned to role-player 
Reggie James to play the point and give the team a spark. 
</P>
<P>
 James did just that, scoring five of his seven points during a 13-2 run to 
pull the Regents back into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reggie was one of the players who hadn't seen a lot of time during the 
regular season but he came in and stepped it up," Halpern said. "I think he 
wanted to get a little bit of revenge from football." 
</P>
<P>
 James was the starting quarterback on the Reseda football team that lost to 
the Pirates in the City Section 3-A semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda (18-1) finally pulled even at halftime, 35-35. The teams traded the 
lead until early in the fourth quarter, when center Roderick Jones and forward 
Archie Williams finished off the Pirates (9-15). 
</P>
<P>
 Jones scored 10 of his 22 points in the final quarter and posted a game-high 
14 rebounds, including several on the offensive end which turned into baskets 
or free-throw opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we were going to have to turn our uniforms in," Jones said. "I 
couldn't feel my legs in the first quarter, (but) then guys from the bench 
started playing well and I got into a rhythm in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams finished with a game-high 23 points despite not starting after 
missing two practices over the past week because his family was moving.  
</P>
<P>
 But Williams didn't miss much action in he second half, because Bailey (14 
points) got into foul trouble early, picking up his fourth foul a minute into 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda sealed the win with free-throw shooting.  
</P>
<P>
 The Regents made 14 of 18 from the line in the fourth quarter and 34 of 43 for 
the game. The Pirates began firing three-pointers in desperation, making only 
one of 10 from the perimeter in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda plays Roosevelt in the second round Friday.

NORTH HOLLYWOOD STUMBLES AGAIN; BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS: FAVORED HUSKIES LOSE IN 
EARLY ROUND FOR THIRD YEAR IN A ROW, FALLING TO DORSEY, 66-65. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the third consecutive year, North Hollywood High waltzed through league 
and conference play without a defeat only to be eliminated in the preliminary 
rounds of the City Section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey trailed for nearly 3 1/2 quarters, but once the Dons claimed their 
first lead, they never relinquished it and held on to upset the Huskies, 66-65, 
Wednesday night in a first-round game of the 4-A Division playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we were in for a tough game," North Hollywood Coach Steve Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies (17-6), who this season traveled to Anchorage and Las Vegas to 
play in highly competitive tournaments in order to better prepare themselves 
for the postseason, were eliminated by the Dons (13-10) for the second time in 
as many years. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey beat the Huskies, 64-61, in overtime in a quarterfinal game last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the option, North Hollywood would have loved to go to overtime this 
time, but the Huskies simply couldn't catch the Dons in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 With North Hollywood trailing by two points, Fantasia Johnson (12 points) was 
forced to foul Sherwyn Morgan at midcourt with 41 seconds left. It was 
Johnson's fifth foul and he became the second Husky starter to foul out. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan, who scored 12 points, went to line and buried two free throws to 
extend the Dons' lead to 66-62. 
</P>
<P>
 With Johnson out of the game, it was up to guard Arthur Lee to lead the 
Huskies' comeback try. Lee, who finished with 21 points, buried his fifth 
three-point basket of the game with 26 seconds to play to pull the Huskies to 
within 66-65. 
</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood tied up the ball on the Dons' ensuing inbound pass and gained 
possession just five seconds later. The Huskies wanted Lee to take the final 
shot, but the Dons were not cooperating. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee fired an 18-foot shot from the wing with five seconds left, but Dorsey's 
Terrell McKnight and Ricky Blackmon were covering him well and Lee's shot 
bounced off the back of the rim and into Morgan's hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackmon scored 17 of his 27 points in the second half. Blackmon and Morgan 
were the only Dons in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Huskies panicked in the fourth quarter, allowing Dorsey to take 
a 60-55 lead on an 11-0 run to open the period. The Huskies were scoreless in 
the final quarter until Lee hit a three-point basket with 4:39 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Damon Ollie, a 6-foot-5 center and one of the area's top recruits, played 
outstanding in his final high school game, but his 20 points, 16 rebounds and 
five blocked shots were not enough to get the Huskies past the first round.

Ventura Buena in the semifinals Saturday.

 San Clemente jumped to a 29-9 lead after one quarter and increased it to 48-13 
by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't expect a game like this," Triton Coach Mary Mulligan said. "Corona 
beat two quality county teams (University and Marina), but we came out with a 
lot of excitement, hit some outside shots and just got going." 
</P>
<P>
 Geminert, San Clemente's 6-0 center, scored 11 points in the first 3:30 of the 
first quarter, and Macintyre scored nine in the final 3:17.

half when the game was well out of reach.

</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge 49, Oxnard Rio Mesa 44 (OT) -- Jamie Oenning had four points in 
overtime and hit two free throws to clinch the game for Woodbridge (27-0). 
Freshman Erin Stovall was calm as she hit two free-throws with no time left on 
the clock to send the game into overtime. Woodbridge will meet Ocean View 
Saturday in the semifinals. Rio Mesa finished 18-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei 70, Quartz Hill 50 -- Leticia Oseguera scored 18 points and Adrienne

victory over third-seeded Rancho Alamitos in a Southern Section Division III-A 
girls' basketball quarterfinal Wednesday at Estancia.

scoring," said Rich Boyce, Estancia's acting coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Estancia will paly San Luis Obispo, which upset second-seeded Ojai Nordhoff, 
in a semifinal Saturday at a site to be determined by Estancia.

<P>
 Richards scored consecutive baskets late in he first quarter, giving the 
Eagles an 8-5 lead. They never trailed after that. 
</P>
<P>

quarter before Estancia pulled away. Jessica Waltz's steal and layup with one 
second left gave Estancia a 24-18 halftime lead.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; CITY ORDERED TO KEEP ACCESS TO STREET OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN POPE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has blocked the city's controversial plans 
to seal off Pioneer Boulevard at the city's eastern border with Hawaiian 
Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Diane Wayne last week granted a preliminary injunction, keeping the 
street open until the case goes to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach City Council in December approved a barrier that would have 
blocked access to the El Dorado Park Estates in east Long Beach after traffic 
studies showed that residential streets were being overused, probably by 
commuters seeking access to the San Gabriel River Freeway (605). 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaiian Gardens officials filed suit, charging that the planned street 
barricade is a racist move intended to keep lower-income, mostly minority 
motorists out of the more affluent El Dorado area. Long Beach officials have 
denied the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamar C. Stein, an attorney representing Hawaiian Gardens, called the ruling a 
major victory for the city. "This is a David and Goliath situation, and so far 
I'm glad to say David is winning," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stein said she is planning to ask Wayne to set a May trial date. JOHN POPE

WESTSIDE WATCH; BEVERLY HILLS HIGH SCHOOL REMAINS AT CENTER STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If there were a lifetime achievement Oscar for high schools, Beverly Hills 
High would have to be a leading contender. 
</P>
<P>
 Its most famous movie role was as Bedford Falls High School in "It's a 
Wonderful Life," the late Frank Capra's classic 1946 tale of an angel and a 
savings and loan bailout. 
</P>
<P>
 The school also appeared, as itself, in 1977's "The Chicken Chronicles." That 
film, starring then-unknown Steve Guttenberg, was based on the true exploits of 
screenwriter Paul Diamond when he worked at a now-defunct South Doheny Drive 
chicken take-out establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Another example of the school's "work" can be seen at 6 p.m. Sunday and at 2 
and 8 p.m. next Friday on cable's American Movie Classics. In the 1947 RKO 
Radio Pictures release, "The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer," Beverly Hills High 
portrays Sunset High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The exterior of the school along Moreno Drive appears in an early scene. The 
only noticeable difference between then and now is that are no skyscrapers 
behind the school. (In 1947, what is now Century City was part of 20th Century 
Fox's back lot.) 
</P>
<P>
 Two scenes were filmed in the school. In the first, visiting English painter 
Dick Nugent (Cary Grant) addresses a school assembly, where 17-year-old Susan 
Turner (Shirley Temple) finds herself smitten. The two have a conversation 
afterward and Nugent departs through the first-floor mathematics department 
corridor. (That same corridor was used last year for a scene in "The Beverly 
Hillbillies.") 
</P>
<P>
 In the second scene, Turner and Nugent get together at a Sunset High 
basketball game, with Beverly Hills High School's Swim-Gym serving as Sunset's 
home court. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 NEW FACE, OLD NAME: It worked for Kenneth P. Hahn. The Los Angeles County 
assessor's election victory was attributed in part to name recognition. Not his 
own, but that of Kenneth J. Hahn, a long-time Los Angeles County supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes Bruce M. Margolin of Beverly Hills, seeking the Democratic 
nomination for the state Assembly seat now held by Burt Margolin, no relation, 
who is running for state insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not just jumping on the bandwagon because my name is the same as his," 
said Bruce Margolin, 52, a criminal defense attorney who has tried four times 
to win election to the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said, it doesn't hurt: "It's a name identification I appreciate 
having." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MONEY MAN: State Sen. Tom Hayden and his aides have always been coy about 
whether he would bring his financial firepower to bear in the campaign to block 
the Santa Monica Civic Center redevelopment plan. 
</P>
<P>
 A partial answer can be found in financial statements filed with the Santa 
Monica city clerk. They show that Hayden ponied up $2,000 of the $4,790 raised 
to mount a successful petition drive to put the Civic Center issue on the 
ballot.  
</P>
<P>
 Hayden also was out in supermarket parking lots gathering signatures. The 
question now is whether his quixotic quest to become governor has eclipsed the 
local issue or whether he will remain the mainstay of the opposition to the 
Civic Center plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the Civic Center plan, by the way, raised $1,302, a figure that 
includes small loans from Santa Monica City Councilman Paul Rosenstein and 
Planning Commissioner Eric Parlee.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: JUDGE RULES IN FAVOR OF AUDITOR CANDIDATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Auditor candidate Willy Molnar has survived a legal effort to remove his 
name from the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge has ruled that Molnar is qualified for the 
position.Former City Auditor Robert Fronke, who supports the only other auditor 
candidate, incumbent Gary L. Burroughs, had sued to keep Molnar's name off the 
ballot last month, alleging that Molnar failed to meet a city requirement that 
the auditor be licensed as a certified public accountant for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Molnar received his CPA certificate in 1987 in Michigan, but moved to 
California two years later and did not become licensed in this state until late 
last year. Judge Diane Wayne ruled that Molnar became a CPA more than five 
years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 "It (the court hearing) was over in five minutes," Molnar said. "I feel 
totally vindicated." 
</P>
<P>
 Fronke said he still doesn't believe Molnar has the required experience. 
"Somebody could get a certificate and go work on a farm -- that's not CPA 
experience," he said. EMILY ADAMS

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; SETTLEMENT EXPECTED IN REFUSE PLANT LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HOLGUIN and JOHN POPE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials and the builder of a refuse-to-energy plant in Long Beach 
appear close to resolving a lengthy multimillion-dollar legal dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh-based Dravo Corp., builder of the plant, issued a statement last 
week that it has agreed in principle to settle the case.Attorneys on both sides 
declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach had filed suit in 1989 against Dravo. Officials contend the city is 
losing millions of dollars a year because the plant, which has been gobbling up 
trash since 1988, does not produce as much electricity as it should. Officials 
said Dravo should pay at least $49 million to compensate for alleged design and 
construction problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Dravo, which filed a countersuit in 1990, claimed Long Beach owes $25 million 
to $30 million in damages, including what the company said is $17 million in 
unpaid bills for the construction project. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach and the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts issued $172 million 
in bonds and used the proceeds to build the plant, the Southeast Resource 
Recovery Facility, on Terminal Island. It was the city's answer to the problem 
of scarce landfills. The plant has three incinerators coupled with steam-driven 
generators. Technicians fired up the first incinerator in July, 1988.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the garbage burned in the plant comes from Long Beach, Lakewood and 
Signal Hill. But private haulers bring refuse from other cities, including 
Lomita and Redondo Beach. RICK HOLGUIN and JOHN POPE

BRADLEY'S POWER PLAY; PLAN WOULD GIVE MAYOR MORE AUTHORITY, MAKE COUNCIL JOBS 
FULL-TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his first seven months as mayor of Compton, Omar Bradley has embraced the 
spotlight time and again.  
</P>
<P>
 He aggressively pressed for a card club, risking the wrath of ministers in a 
town where churches have traditionally been the base of political power. 
</P>
<P>
 He's taken on rap artists for derogatory lyrics and, in the same breath, 
triggered heated protests by accusing Jews of promoting a negative stereotype 
of blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Bradley touched off a new debate when he proposed a major overhaul 
of city government that would give the mayor more power and make the mayor and 
council positions full-time, with hefty pay increases. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, which eventually would have to be approved by voters, would give the 
mayor authority to set agendas for council meetings and to veto council 
decisions. The mayor's position would become separate from the council, and his 
salary would increase from $32,000 to $70,000 a year. Council salaries would 
jump to $40,000 from $22,000, and a fifth council seat would be created. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The sweeping proposal, both opponents and supporters say, is illustrative of 
Bradley and his leadership style. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's bodacious, he's brilliant, he's young," said Amen Rahh, a college 
professor and member of the Compton Unified school board. "That's what we 
need." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a dictator," said Patricia A. Moore, a former councilwoman who lost her 
mayoral bid to Bradley last June. "It's almost criminal against the citizens. 
The city doesn't hardly generate enough money to support current salaries, much 
less a pay raise like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley still has to get council approval before his proposal can go to the 
June 7 ballot, but a majority of council members have indicated they favor a 
public vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley, 35, who was born and raised in Compton, teaches English at Lynwood 
High School. He first was elected to the council in 1991, and has long 
complained of the demands of holding elected office and another job. He is 
married and has two children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether you know it or not, this is already a full-time job," the mayor said 
when he introduced his reorganization plan at a council meeting. "We all do a 
lot of work for this city, and a lot more needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time Bradley has angled for a salary raise. In December, 
he proposed that a Gaming Commission, composed of the mayor and four other 
council members, be created to oversee nightly bingo games at the city-owned 
Ramada Hotel and the planned card casino. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley suggested that the council be paid another $11,000 a year for serving 
as gaming commissioners. After public protests, the commission was created, but 
as an unpaid body. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor admits that he tends to charge ahead on proposals that he feels 
strongly about, even if they generate heat. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the most vocal of three council members who approved a hotly debated 
card club for the city in December, 1992. Bradley said at the time that his 
vote for the casino might cost him votes in last year's mayoral race, but that 
he believed a casino would provide much-needed revenues for the struggling 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 The club is scheduled to open in the spring of 1995, and officials estimate 
that it will generate $10 million in revenue for Compton. Bradley said he wants 
to use the money to hire more police and clean up decrepit business districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the flap over rap music. While lecturing rap star Eazy-E about 
his depictions of black life, Bradley also insinuated that Jews were behind a 
conspiracy to promote negative rap. He apologized in the wake of heated 
criticism, but continued to repeat the allegation on radio talk shows in the 
following days. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Bradley claims that he triggered the public debate over rap lyrics that 
resulted in major radio stations across the country banning songs with negative 
depictions of blacks and women. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even some of Bradley's political opponents will admit he's instituted some 
popular programs. He draws praise for establishing 100 Strong Men of Compton, a 
volunteer organization that has embarked on a citywide cleanup project.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's not unsophisticated," said Rep. Walter R. Tucker III (D-Compton), a 
former mayor of Compton. "I've seen some good come out of projects like 100 
Strong Men. But I'm also hearing a lot of distrust out there right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics, for example, question Bradley's recent trip to China, in which 
he flew first-class at city expense. An ardent supporter of the business 
community, he also plans a trip to Africa to promote international business 
relations for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Some veteran politicians say the young mayor is simply pushing too far, too 
fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's a nice young man," said attorney Maxcy D. Filer, who spent 14 
years on the council. "But I can't agree with some of the issues he's pushing. 
We have enough potholes and trees to trim to keep him busy."

CANDIDATES GEAR UP FOR POLL POSITION; POLITICS: A LARGE FIELD OF CHALLENGERS 
WILL TANGLE APRIL 12 FOR COUNCIL SEATS IN A DOZEN CITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Colorful campaign signs -- the bigger the better -- have already started to 
crop up. Finishing touches are being applied to flyers, mailers and 
advertisements. Candidate forums have been scheduled and parties are being 
planned.  
</P>
<P>
 It's election time once again in the Southeast area. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 12, voters in 12 cities will head to the polls to fill 30 City 
Council seats. Most council incumbents are seeking new terms, but seven 
veterans have opted to step down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to let someone else do it," said La Mirada Councilman Lou Piltz, 
who is leaving office after 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters will go to the polls in Artesia, Cerritos, La Habra Heights, La Mirada, 
Norwalk, Pico Rivera, Santa Fe Springs, Whittier, Lakewood, Paramount, Signal 
Hill and Bellflower.  
</P>
<P>
 The largest field of candidates has filed in Norwalk, where 16 council 
hopefuls are vying for three seats. Incumbents Robert J. Arthur, Luigi A. 
Vernola and Gordon Stefenhagen -- who was appointed two years ago when Grace F. 
Napolitano was elected to the state Assembly -- are seeking additional terms.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the challengers is Jesse Luera, who was fired last year as the city's 
director of social services after being accused of sexual harassment. Luera 
appealed, but a city personnel board last week upheld his dismissal. Luera, who 
also is president of the Norwalk-La Mirada Unified school board, has denied the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pico Rivera, 11 people are running for three seats, including incumbents 
John G. Chavez and Richard L. Mercado. Mayor Alberto Natividad is stepping down 
after 12 years in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez and Mercado may come under fire because of their support last year of a 
failed ballot initiative that would have allowed a card club in the city. 
Voters narrowly defeated the measure last June, and some council challengers -- 
fearing lingering support of another initiative -- are running on an 
anti-casino platform. They include Elpidio A. "Pete" Ramirez, who is making a 
bid for the council after losing his seat last November on the El Rancho 
Unified School District board. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten candidates, including three incumbents and seven challengers, are running 
for the Whittier City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Janet R. Henke is seeking to complete the unexpired term of Larry 
Haendiges, who relinquished his seat after admitting he filed a false police 
report during the 1992 campaign. The council appointed Henke to serve until 
this election. She faces one challenger, student Robert A. Canales. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents Bob Henderson and Helen McKenna Rahder face six challengers for 
four-year terms. Whittier candidates will face stricter campaign disclosure 
rules. Spurred by a $40,000 contribution from Chevron in the final weeks of the 
1992 election, the City Council passed an ordinance requiring candidates to 
report all contributions of more than $100 within 48 hours. The ordinance 
covers the last 16 days before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cerritos, councilmen John F. Crawley and Sherman R. Kappe are running for 
second terms, while Councilwoman Ann B. Joynt will step down after serving 
eight years. A city charter limits council service to two consecutive terms.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the five challengers in Cerritos is Charles J. Kim, who raised eyebrows 
in 1990 when he spent more than $100,000 in an unsuccessful election bid. Kim 
said he has raised a mere $2,000 so far this time, and doesn't plan to approach 
the spending levels of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bellflower, former City Council members Randy Bomgaars and Joseph E. 
Cvetko, who were defeated in 1992, are seeking to return to office. Incumbents 
Bob Stone, Bill Pendleton and John Ansdell are seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Two incumbents in both La Mirada and La Habra Heights have decided to step 
down. In La Mirada, two-term Councilman Art Leslie joins Piltz in leaving 
office. Leslie had vowed to serve only two terms when he was elected. Only 
incumbent Wayne Rew is making a reelection bid. 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra Heights council members Diane Kane and Richard Newbre have decided to 
step down after one term.

TRYING TO READ THE MIND OF A MUDSLIDE; CONSERVATION: MALIBU STRUGGLES WITH 
NATURE. WHERE MIGHT THE NEXT DELUGE BE? AND WHAT CAN BE DONE TO PREVENT IT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 "I don't mean to sound flippant, but nothing is a surprise out here." 
</P>
<P>
 So says John Clement, public works director for Malibu. And small wonder: Like 
most city officials, he has been faced with disaster after disaster of late. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the colossal mud and debris flows that were unleashed in Sunday's 
storm, the worst one yet, were not unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just textbook of what happened in the last storm, only worse, and 
there was only two inches of rain," Clement said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said that in this storm, the third to hit Malibu in two weeks, 
at least 30 houses sustained serious water and mud damage. That figure appears 
to be climbing, said Sarah Maurice, spokeswoman for Malibu. At least two homes 
on Pacific Coast Highway had their foundations exposed when huge portions of 
asphalt collapsed from the weight of the mud and debris. 
</P>
<P>
 About 25 houses were damaged in the Feb. 7 storm, with a few getting hit again 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has once again accelerated its efforts to predict the unpredictable. 
Where might the mud come down next? How much more mud and how many more 
boulders could still be sitting up in the mountains? And what can be done to 
prevent it? 
</P>
<P>
 What is clear is that the most vulnerable areas have been those where the Nov. 
2 firestorm burned away virtually all the vegetation -- Las Flores Canyon, Big 
Rock Drive, Piedra Gorda Canyon and the land along Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 New areas that suffered considerable damage in Sunday's storm were along 
Pacific Coast Highway below Pena Canyon and at Serra Retreat on Serra Road, 
where seven houses were inundated. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem has been that the amount of mud that comes down is more than the 
check dams, debris walls and racks, and catch basins can hold, Clement said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The river at Las Flores Creek is now higher than the road from the last rain 
because it deposited a phenomenal amount of silt and debris," Clement said. "We 
are now putting a dam up at the hairpin turn at Big Rock Drive and PCH, and 
another at Las Flores Canyon and PCH. We can only hold back so much of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosann Durrah of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Soil Conservation 
Service toured the stricken areas of Malibu on Monday and Tuesday. The agency 
was called in after the Nov. 2 firestorm to counsel the city and its residents 
on how to protect property from mud and debris flows in the denuded hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know how many more boulders and debris are up there," Durrah said 
Wednesday. "There are some areas that we can't even get to. But all the (catch 
basins and retaining walls) we built in Las Flores Canyon and Carbon Canyon and 
the culverts worked perfectly in the last storm to stop boulders." 
</P>
<P>
 Clement said the city, using funds from the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, will erect dams in Piedra Gorda Canyon above Big Rock Drive, where the 
most devastating flooding has repeatedly occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 To further reduce flooding at Big Rock Drive and Pacific Coast Highway, 
Clement said, city engineers and geologists will install overflow pipes along 
Pacific Coast Highway across from Big Rock Drive, where drains at residences 
have failed to work. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also plans to look for long-term solutions. As a first step, it plans 
to use FEMA funds to conduct a geological study of Piedra Gorda Canyon and the 
Big Rock area. 
</P>
<P>
 According to soil experts, however, Malibu will be vulnerable to mudslides for 
four to five years -- until hillside vegetation grows back. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens next," said Clement, "is dependent on the mercy of God and the 
intensity of the next rain."

JUDGE ORDERS REMOVAL OF JETTIES; ENVIRONMENT: NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN 
TOLD TO DISMANTLE DANGEROUSLY ERODED STEEL PILINGS AT LAS TUNAS BEACH. THE 
BARRIERS HAVE BEEN THE FOCUS OF LEGAL WRANGLING FOR 14 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After 14 years of legal wrangling, some dangerously eroded steel sheet pilings 
that threaten surfers, joggers and swimmers at Las Tunas Beach in Malibu may 
finally be headed for the scrap heap. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge John Zebrowski has given a neighborhood 
association 30 days to apply for a Coastal Commission permit to remove the 
pilings, known as groins. Most of them are on private property. 
</P>
<P>
 The order is the latest twist in a legal tempest that has involved the state 
of California, 92 homeowners, 30 lawyers, 12 insurance companies and litigation 
costs approaching $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Zebrowski's order, issued earlier this month, was aimed at nudging a 
beachfront property owner group, mired in dissension, to dismantle the jetties, 
which all agree have become a public hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had an agreement for over 2 1/2 years that the groins would be removed, 
but they have just kept diddling and diddling," said Jim Strout, an assistant 
executive director for the State Lands Commission. "We just want to get the 
hazard out of there." 
</P>
<P>
 The 13 groins vary in length from 80 to 455 feet and were constructed in 1929 
by the Title Insurance and Trust Co., now Ticor, to build up sand near a series 
of Malibu beachfront lots, thus protecting them from erosion. The groins, which 
run from the beach into the surf, resemble thin metal gates with some encased 
in corroding concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in the early 1980s, two joggers, on separate occasions, cut 
themselves on the exposed sheet metal and sued the state. Both settled out of 
court for about $30,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, the state sued Ticor, which in turn sued a group of 92 property 
owners as co-defendants, to repair the groins. The state threatened to remove 
the jetties unless they were repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 The suits resulted in a storm of litigation among neighbors, their insurance 
companies and Ticor. Debate centered on who was responsible for the jetties, 
whether they should be eliminated, and, if so, whether they should be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, the parties reached an agreement mandating that Ticor contribute 
$2.15 million, and the insurance companies $400,000, to build eight bulwarks, 
known as "rubble mounds," over eight of the eastern groins at Las Tunas. The 
state agreed to tear down the remaining five western jetties. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the bulwarks have not been built. Roughly one-fourth of the area's 92 
property owners vigorously contested construction of the bulwarks because they 
believed the groins should have been removed in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are dangerous and should be permanently removed," said Fay Singer, a 
self-proclaimed "Ph.D. in groins," and a resident leading the anti-jetties 
fight. "The groins haven't provided any erosion protection for years -- they're 
like a fork; sand is flowing right through them. If they're taken out, the 
beach won't be any worse than it is now." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, particularly surfers, worry about the detrimental effects the eight 
bulwarks could have on the waves at Topanga Point beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "The spot has a delicate equilibrium of cobblestones coming from the mountains 
and rocks and sand coming down the beach, which make for a special wave," said 
John Hearne, an official for the Surfrider Foundation. "Expanding these groins 
will be an environmental abomination, and could severely affect the sand flow 
to (Topanga) Point." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a majority of homeowners believe some safeguard is needed lest their 
houses float out to sea. The group hired Moffat and Nichol, a coastal 
engineering company, which provided a study of the area's erosion and a 
proposal for the construction of the bulwarks. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I lived there, I wouldn't feel comfortable without some type of shore 
protection," said Bob Nathan, an engineer for Moffat and Nichol. "That beach is 
an eroding beach, and I wouldn't have a warm and fuzzy feeling watching the 
waves break right outside my window." 
</P>
<P>
 The beach property owners had formed a Geologic Hazard Abatement District, 
known as GHAD, under the auspices of the Malibu City Council to proceed with 
the work and limit individual homeowner liability. The Coastal Commission 
granted a permit to homeowners in July, 1991, to begin the bulwark project. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, Malibu hired an engineering firm to review the project. That 
review created doubt about the project's feasibility, and council members 
ordered that the district be disbanded and the bulwark project be shelved. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1993, the Coastal Commission refused to renew GHAD's building 
permit, citing the political dispute between the homeowner group and the 
council and other environmental issues raised by the Surfrider Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Hauser, a spokeswoman for Craig Dummit, an attorney representing a 
majority of the Las Tunas property owners, said Dummit intends to comply with 
Zebrowski's order and tender an application for the removal.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH GATE; HIGH SCHOOL IS TOPS IN DISTRICT FOR ATTENDANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 South Gate High School students have been taught that dental appointments and 
colds are no excuse to miss school. Apparently neither is a 6.8 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 When the 3,970-student school reopened one week after last month's devastating 
temblor, 93% of the students reported to class. Within three days the 
attendance rate was 97%, said Jim Alther, the assistant principal who oversees 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 For two consecutive years, South Gate has had the best attendance record among 
the Los Angeles Unified School District's 49 senior high schools. For the first 
five months of this school year, the rate was 95.5%. During the 1992-93 school 
year, South Gate's attendance rate was about 95%, outdistancing second-place El 
Camino High School at 87.7%. The districtwide average attendance rate is 83%, 
according to district records.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; HEARING FOR EDUCATOR WHO SPANKED EX-PUPIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The founder of troubled Chrysalis School for girls faces a court hearing next 
week for spanking a former student at a birthday party. 
</P>
<P>
 Founder Julia Margaux has pleaded not guilty to a misdemeanor charge of 
battery.Margaux said she spanked the girl because the child was being 
incorrigible at the Aug. 20 party, but contends the incident has been blown out 
of proportion. Margaux said the former student's mother was still angry that 
her daughter had been expelled from Chrysallis months earlier because of 
behavior problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (another parent) had spanked (the girl), it wouldn't have been a problem," 
Margaux said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the August birthday party the girl's mother filed a complaint with 
police, but the city prosecutor's office originally declined to file charges, 
citing a lack of evidence. The mother recently asked prosecutors to reconsider 
and officials found the complaint merited court action, City Prosecutor John 
Vander Lans said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school, which opened 17 months ago, has suffered a number of setbacks 
recently. More than half of the students departed in the wake of rumors that 
Margaux was treating children harshly and that the school's curriculum was 
deficient. 
</P>
<P>
 Margaux said the rumors are unfounded.

TOPICS / THE ARTS; IT'S TIME TO ACT, SAYS POETRY SOCIETY 
</P>

By PENELOPE MOFFET, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the large, elegant lobby of the Chateau Marmont hotel in West Hollywood, 
something strange happened Sunday afternoon: An actor and a poet took turns 
reading poems to an attentive audience clustered on claw-footed, soft-cushioned 
old furniture and plastic rental chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 It was part of "The Act of the Poet," a reading series begun in September, 
1991, to present acclaimed poets reading their own work and actors presenting 
personal favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Sunday's program featured Sherod Santos, a University of Missouri English 
professor who has won several awards for his three books of poems, and Michael 
Ontkean, who appeared in the television series "Twin Peaks." 
</P>
<P>
 There are plenty of reading series in Los Angeles that provide poets with 
public forums. What makes the series unique is its pairing of actors and poets 
in a setting far more luxurious than the average coffeehouse or university 
auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 The series is sponsored by the New York-based Poetry Society of America. Six 
to eight readings a year are held at the Chateau Marmont. According to Elena 
Karina Byrne, the society's Los Angeles regional co-director, "The Act of the 
Poet" is designed to "create an inter-art exchange" between poetry and 
performance and to interest more people in verse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really intent on bringing great poetry to Los Angeles and making it a 
little more accessible to a larger audience than the university audience," said 
Byrne, a Palos Verdes poet. "People are always astonished at how accessible 
poetry is," when they hear it read aloud at the Chateau Marmont, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, the poetry society entices much-honored poets from other parts of the 
country to Los Angeles, offering them $500 to read plus a free night at the 
hotel. The hotel donates the poet's room and the reading hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to not think of ourselves as competing with any other venue," Byrne 
said. "Despite our wanting to bring what we consider the best poets, we don't 
want to be elitist in every sense." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh yeah?" quipped Helen Driscoll, the society's director of events, who was 
setting up chairs nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Driscoll, a Los Feliz resident who works at the Heritage Book Shop on Melrose, 
has helped run the series since its inception. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just love great poetry," she said. "I went to some local readings and 
people were sitting there rapt and the poetry was pathetic." 
</P>
<P>
 Many important American poets have been featured in the series, including 
Galway Kinnell, Sharon Olds, Robert Hass, Mark Strand, James Tate, Carol Muske 
and Quincy Troupe. 
</P>
<P>
 Actors who have participated include Tim Curry, Dana Delaney, John Glover, Joe 
Spano, Blythe Danner and Alfre Woodard. 
</P>
<P>
 Last December, poet Tess Gallagher of Washington state and actress Lisa 
Pelikan read together; in January, Los Angeles poet Wanda Coleman was paired 
with actor Harry Hamlin. Some in the audience thought Gallagher, Coleman and 
Santos offered livelier, more dramatic readings than did the actors. 
</P>
<P>
 Danee Shaheen, a mid-Wilshire resident who came to the Coleman reading and 
returned for Santos, said she had been extremely impressed by Coleman's 
performance. As for Hamlin, "he could have done a better job of selecting 
(poems). He kind of winged it. But his delivery was great." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaheen said she has been attending poetry readings in different venues for 
years. "But truthfully, if they don't read it well, I don't know what they're 
talking about," she laughed. "With Wanda Coleman, there was no mystery. There 
was no question where we were going and what she was trying to convey." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last Sunday, about 70 people turned up for the Santos/Ontkean reading. Hearing 
the poetry was a little difficult this time because the usual sound system 
provider had gone AWOL, leaving the performers to depend on lung power. Mary 
McDonnell, the actress originally scheduled to appear, was also absent, due to 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Darrell Larson, an actor and poet who initiated the series and 
now co-directs it with Byrne, getting actors to promise to participate isn't 
hard. Getting them to show up is another matter. The actors' performances are 
donated, and sometimes professional or personal complications keep them away. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Act of the Poet" operates on an annual budget of $4,500 from the poetry 
society and donors plus what comes in at the door. Admission is $5. Most of the 
money goes to the poets to cover their $500 fee and the rest covers publicity 
and equipment rentals. The series has no paid staff. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ontkean, the author of five books of poetry, read a hodgepodge of poems, 
including a spontaneous rhyme created by his 5-year-old daughter and work by 
poets Sharon Olds, Galway Kinnell and Dylan Thomas. Santos read mainly from his 
most recent book, "City of Women," meditations on relations between the sexes. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Jackie and Robert Parker, a West Los Angeles couple, expressed 
enthusiasm for the series, which they attend regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the actors, and their interpretations, which is what a lot of people 
don't like," said Jackie Parker, a photographer. Before she began coming to the 
Chateau Marmont readings, she did not pay much attention to poetry, Parker 
said. Now, she sometimes hunts up the poets' work before the events. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 13, the series will feature poets only in "Distinct Traditions: Myths 
and Voices of the Many Americas," with Agha Shahid Ali, Toi Derricotte, Cecilia 
Vicuna and Ray Young Bear. On May 22, Stanley Kunitz, former consultant in 
poetry to the Library of Congress, will read with an actor.

COVER STORY; LIFE'S SNUGGEST HARBOR; THOSE WHO CALL BOATS HOME FIND OPEN SPACES 
AMID TIGHT QUARTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This is the life. Let other people go home and sit in dark living rooms or 
cramped patios, trying to escape the sounds of police sirens and the squabbling 
of the next-door neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 When Frank and Jean Bennett get home from work, they stretch out in isolated 
comfort on the afterdeck of La Folie, a sleek 60-foot motor craft in one of the 
outer slips of Long Beach's Downtown Marina, and ponder the city's jeweled 
skyline across a moonlit harbor, hearing only the haunting hourly call of the 
Queen Mary's foghorn. 
</P>
<P>
 "You leave all the street signs, the traffic lights, the white lines and the 
congestion behind," Frank Bennett says, settling deeper into his chair. "You're 
out on the edge of society." 
</P>
<P>
 He gestures expansively at the boat he has lived in for the past 10 years. 
"There is no down side," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The good life, eh? Jean Bennett, who has just struggled up the gangplank with 
a couple of bags of groceries, gives her husband a flinty look. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you, 10 years is way too long to live here," she says, with 
rocklike conviction. "You just get tired of hauling things. I'd rather do 
something else." 
</P>
<P>
 Boating clearly isn't for everybody. It's cramped and inconvenient; it's 
increasingly expensive; and the plumbing is, in many cases, just a shade better 
than Tobacco Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the morning, you wet yourself down, turn off the water, soap up, then turn 
the water on again. That's a shower," says Hal Lane, referring to the limited 
water supplies on board. Lane, chairman of the city's Marine Advisory 
Commission, recently returned to terra firma in search of more creature 
comforts after a Spartan five years on a boat. 
</P>
<P>
 But sacrifices and all, the boating life offers a kind of freedom that 
landlubbers can't even conceive of, boat owners often say. Loosen those 
moorings that tie your boat to the marina, they say, and you're in a vast, 
rolling world, out of the reach of bosses, bill collectors, traffic cops and 
nagging relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you never head for the open seas, just the gentle rocking of the boat, 
the calls of sea birds and the creaking of the lines is enough to transport you 
magically from the workaday world. 
</P>
<P>
 There are more than 300 people in Long Beach's two marinas, claiming an 
assortment of about 200 yachts, schooners, windjammers and power boats as home. 
Long Beach live-aboards pay as much as $1,150 a month for the privilege of 
living in their tidy dockside forest of white masts and blue tarpaulins. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the economy, that forest is a little thinner now than it used to 
be. After the recent defense and aerospace layoffs, many once-flush boaters in 
the Long Beach area are selling their beloved tubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the city's two marinas, with more than 3,800 slips for 
recreational and live-aboard boaters, were almost 100% occupied. Now, there's a 
vacancy rate of about 15% for the recreational boaters.  
</P>
<P>
 But the economy hasn't taken the gloss off the live-aboard life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an affordable solution for some people having economic problems," says 
Joni Anderson, administrative analyst with the city's Marine Bureau. "If a 
couple already has a boat, sometimes it's less expensive to give up the house 
and become a live-aboard." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, there is a growing waiting list of people who want to convert their 
boats into residences. A limit of 10% live-aboards on most marina gangways -- 
imposed by the state Lands Commission to prevent floating dockside "towns" that 
lock out casual boaters -- has meant that some applicants have been waiting a 
decade or more. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to wait for somebody else to die or sell their boat or move away," 
says veteran live-aboard Russ Smith.  
</P>
<P>
 Many of those who are waiting are middle-aged or elderly boat hobbyists who, 
with their children grown, suddenly find themselves able both to fulfill a 
dream and to save money. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard and Carolyn Gardner waited 13 years to turn their 85-foot yacht 
Deerleap into their primary residence. "Nobody wanted to die on me," says 
Richard, 53, the owner of an Orange County auto parts warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, last October, with a live-aboard slot available, they were able to 
move from a four-acre ranch in Modjeska Canyon, near Lake Irvine, to their 
boat. The ranch, complete with pet possums, raccoons, cats and dogs, was turned 
over to a daughter, and the Gardners began a leaner, more economical life 
without mortgage payments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Economical to a point," Gardner says. "If you're buying a home, you're 
gaining equity with your monthly payments. You don't gain any equity by paying 
slip fees." 
</P>
<P>
 Novices soon discover that life on a boat, with its constant round of 
painting, sanding, chipping and fixing, can be high on elbow grease and low on 
luxury. 
</P>
<P>
 Those tiny staterooms with little or no closet space can begin to close in on 
you, Lane says. "For a sit-down dinner, you seat four at the table and two 
others on the couch with TV tables," Lane says. "It's not bad, except the 
people on the couch are out in left field." 
</P>
<P>
 And the costs of maintaining a boat -- they just never seem to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boats are horrible investments," says movie producer Michael Lesner, who 
lives on a 92-foot yacht in the Alamitos Bay Marina. "It's like taking a 
wheelbarrow full of money every month and dumping it overboard." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the most committed boat owners respond with knowing laughs at the famous 
remark of a jaundiced ex-yachtsman, who said that the day he bought his boat 
was the second happiest in his life. And the happiest? "The day I sold it." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from monthly slip rental, $9.63 per foot, or $481.50 for a 50-foot boat, 
and live-aboard fees, $115 a month, most boat owners find they spend well over 
$200 a month for maintenance, insurance and property taxes. The rental fees go 
into a fund to run the marinas, including a Marine Bureau police force of two 
dozen officers who patrol around the clock and administer the rest of Long 
Beach's waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of those fees, there are often the kinds of surprise expenses -- engine 
parts, $200-a-gallon copper-based paint for the hull, new canvas -- that car 
owners never encounter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things just keep going up," says Russ Smith, 68, a retired contractor who 
moved into the Alamitos Bay Marina 33 years ago. "When I first got here, it was 
85 cents a foot." 
</P>
<P>
 For some elderly slip renters, the boat can become a trap. With fixed incomes 
insufficient to cover the expenses and fees, they can find themselves living on 
floating wrecks with insufficient funds to cover even basic maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 Karlice Cobb, 78, lives in a cluttered 44-foot power boat that she and her 
late husband built more than 20 years ago. Cobb, a cocker spaniel and a cat 
survive on a small pension and a Social Security check that is barely enough to 
cover her monthly slip fee of $547. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobb's Castle, as she calls her boat, has clearly seen better times, though a 
group of volunteers recently painted it for her. "I haven't had it hauled out 
(removed from the water so the hull can be repainted) in almost three years," 
says Cobb, who tries to make ends meet by sewing and by handing out food 
samples in a supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
 Even just sitting in the marina, boats can molder into disrepair, boaters say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an extremely harsh environment out here," Lesner says. Wood-loving sea 
worms, corrosive salt water, dry rot from puddling rainwater -- all of these 
have to be fought the way a homeowner fights vermin. 
</P>
<P>
 Neglect the haul-out every year or so, and you leave the hull vulnerable to 
worms and corrosion. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you least expect it, a plank will pop out on you and you've got a hole 
in your hull like this," Lesner says, holding his hands far enough apart to fit 
a large cantaloupe between them. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobb, short and thin, with a mop of gray hair, has been living on a boat for 
more than 30 years, mostly, she says, because she gravitated instinctively to 
the sea. "I don't think I could live on the shore now," she says. "If the boat 
sinks, I'll go down with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Boat owners are obligated to keep their vessels in a navigable condition, 
Anderson says. But live-aboards like Cobb represent a dilemma for the city, 
which has the power to evict owners who don't comply. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city obviously can't afford to repair boats," says Anderson, the Long 
Beach Marine Bureau official. "On the other hand, we don't want to add another 
homeless person to the streets. It's a gray area." 
</P>
<P>
 The sink-or-swim devotion to life on the water that Cobb speaks to is 
widespread. 
</P>
<P>
 Russ and Donna Smith think sometimes about moving onto land. 
</P>
<P>
 "But look at the view we have," Smith says, indicating a broad sweep of open 
water on Alamitos Bay, where a flock of geese is coming in for a landing. "For 
what I could sell the boat for, what would I get on land? A little tract house 
on some dingy street." 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest challenge of living on a boat, Smith says, is fitting everything 
into the kinds of spaces where, if you stretch your arms too wide, you'll skin 
your knuckles. 
</P>
<P>
 Most boats are like floating Swiss watches, with every little niche having a 
function. Smith shows you around his blocky-looking 51-foot power boat Tsunami. 
There are drawers under bunks, cabinets in walls, storage spaces hidden under 
the cushions of a couch, a hatch leading to a footlocker-size hollow for tools 
and spare engine parts. Odd-size spaces are stuffed with canned goods and extra 
rolls of paper towels. 
</P>
<P>
 The galley is a square yard of kitchen equipment, complete with microwave and 
oven, where Thanksgiving turkeys, carefully measured ahead of time, have been 
prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the comforts of home -- except a washer and dryer," says Donna, who 
washes clothes at a local coin-operated laundry. 
</P>
<P>
 On jaunts to Catalina or Dana Point, Russ presides over the little wheelhouse, 
which is equipped with radar, citizen's band and marine radios, depth sounder 
and electronic navigating equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 For all his sailorly confidence, Russ, 68, is an unlikely candidate for prime 
live-aboard booster. One of his earliest experiences of living aboard, as a 
19-year-old Navy seaman, ended when he was dunked unceremoniously in the South 
Pacific after the aircraft carrier Princeton was sunk by a Japanese dive bomber 
in October, 1944, off the coast of Luzon in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I know, I'm the only survivor who's living on a boat," says Smith, 
who attends annual survivor reunions. Smith spent almost two hours in the ocean 
that day before a Navy destroyer picked him up. 
</P>
<P>
 The Smiths had a close call seven years ago, when a supertanker grazed the 
Tsunami in a fog just outside Long Beach Harbor. "It was going so fast, it 
sucked us in next to it, and we couldn't veer away," Donna says. 
</P>
<P>
 That encounter resulted in $16,000 worth of damage to the Tsunami's port side, 
but it didn't dampen the Smiths' enthusiasm for the boating life. 
</P>
<P>
 They say the state-imposed limits on the number of live-aboards keep the 
marinas peaceful. "It's like living in a little, isolated town," Russ Smith 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 The ideal live-aboard is a putterer with a knack for mechanics and an affinity 
for the Spartan life. Someone like Robert Pard, retired Air Force pilot and 
firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Pard and his wife, Norma, both 70, have been living on boats for 30 years. In 
1964, they sailed their first boat from Norway, across the Atlantic, through 
the Panama Canal and up the Pacific coast of Central America and Mexico to Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pards' current boat is the Posh, a trim, Finnish-made motorized sailboat 
with a teak-lined cabin. Pard's idea of a good time is tinkering with the 
boat's motor. "I'm a putterer," he says. "There's always something to do. I 
can't sit in the rocking chair." 
</P>
<P>
 When he's not fooling with the engine, he works on the teak trim. Sanding and 
varnishing. "There's more of that than anything," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Pard would like to see less clutter in its elegant salon and cozy stateroom. 
He's concerned about the accumulation of his wife's art supplies. She's into 
Japanese ink sketching at the moment, but there have been oil painting binges, 
with bulky framed canvases piling up in the staterooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Life on a boat tests a married couple's compatibility, Norma Pard says. "Sure, 
there are little barbs now and then," she says. "But the water is very 
soothing. You get over it very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Few boaters have gone as whole-hog into the boating life as movie producer 
Lesner, who has turned the Dorsal, a 70-year-old yacht once owned by a 
breakfast cereal heiress, into home, production office and haven from the 
stresses of The Industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being in Hollywood, you deal with people from time to time who want to pay 
you with cocaine," says Lesner, 45, who expects to go into production on his 
action feature "Balloon" later this year. "You meet lawyers who try to bilk 
you. Then you come out here where pretense does not exist." 
</P>
<P>
 In the marina, Lesner says, he encounters mostly generous, unpretentious 
people. "Some of them are millionaires, but not your classic millionaires," he 
says. "They have holes in their jeans, and they'll come over and crawl around 
in the bilges of your boat just to help with a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Lesner's "office" is the boat's fantail, where he sprawls across an 
upholstered banquette and does business over a telephone. Sometimes he slips 
into a Jacuzzi in the middle of the deck or studies the marina's wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 A pregnant sea lion recently took up residence on a dock near the boat, Lesner 
says, and herons and sandpipers often fly in. "It's an amazing little 
ecological niche," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 For live-aboards, the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake was nothing more than 
another natural phenomenon -- just a gentle jiggling of their boats from the 
back-and-forth movement of pilings pulling on moorings. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hear the slapping of the water on the bottom of the boat," says Russ 
Smith, "and you can see the street lamps whipping back and forth." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bennetts, who run a metal processing plant in Downtown Los Angeles, slept 
through it. 
</P>
<P>
 "A guy who works with us called at about 5:30 (an hour after the quake) and 
said, 'Did you realize we had a major earthquake?' " recalled Jean Bennett. 
"Frank said, 'Hold on a minute,' and he went and looked outside. He came back 
and said, 'Well, I'm in about 20 feet of water.' " 
</P>
<P>
 As people from elsewhere in the region tried to piece their lives back 
together, sweeping away rubble and glass, nothing had changed for the Bennetts, 
the Smiths, the Pards and the rest. Nothing at all. The Cost of Living Aboard 
</P>
<P>
 A boat used to be the cheaper way to live. Today, living aboard can be 
expensive. This is what it would cost per month to live in a Long Beach marina 
if your boat is 50 feet long and cost $100,000: 
</P>
<P>
 Boat payment: $806* 
</P>
<P>
 Slip rental ($9.63 per foot): 482 
</P>
<P>
 Live-aboard fee (including utilities and parking): 115 
</P>
<P>
 Maintenance, including annual hull cleaning: 84 
</P>
<P>
 Property tax and other taxes: 75 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance: 117 
</P>
<P>
 Total: $1,679

COMMUNITY NEWS: CULVER CITY; OFFICER WOUNDED WHILE CHASING SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIAN MAHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 24 year-old Culver City police officer was in fair condition Wednesday with 
a gunshot wound in his neck as police continued their hunt for the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Travis Marschall, a five-year veteran of the Culver City Police 
Department, was shot after responding to a 911 call placed about 10 p.m. 
Saturday by a couple who had been robbed at gunpoint in the driveway of their 
home in the 4400 block of Le Bourget Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the victims gave police a description of two male suspects and a 
vehicle. Marschall and a partner spotted the suspects' car heading east on 
Washington Boulevard. The car then turned south on Higuera Street into the 
Hayden industrial area, where the officers tried to halt the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (car) then sped away but collided with the center median at Hayden Avenue 
and National Boulevard," police spokesman Sgt. Dave Paroda said. The two 
suspects ran in different directions, and the officers pursued them on foot. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Marschall) gave chase for quite a while, jumping over fences and walls," 
Paroda said. "He got within five feet of one of the suspects, when the suspect 
turned and shot the officer in the neck." 
</P>
<P>
 About 60 officers from Burbank, Santa Monica, and the Los Angeles Police and 
Sheriff's departments surrounded the area for more than 9 1/2 hours, but the 
suspects eluded capture. 
</P>
<P>
 The wounding of Marschall has caused concern on Culver City's tight-knit, 
117-officer department, which has not had an officer shot in more than a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a young, aggressive officer who has been doing an outstanding job -- no 
one is better in that type of situation," said Culver City Police Sgt. Gary 
McEwen. "Everyone here feels more vulnerable. It could have been any one of 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Culver City Mayor Mike Balkman: "I just feel awful. It's one of those 
things that just shouldn't happen. He was just doing his job. Any time an 
officer is shot, it hits close to home." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information on the shooting is asked to call the Culver City 
Police Department at (310) 202-5648. ADRIAN MAHER

COMMUNITY NEWS: BEVERLY HILLS; NO CHARGE FOR NON-RESIDENT LIBRARY USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. JEANETTE AVENT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has taken the public relations advice of the city's library 
director and decided not to charge non-residents to enter the city's public 
library. 
</P>
<P>
 Library Director Michael Steinfeld had been asked by the council in July to 
explore the possibility of charging people who do not live in the city for an 
entry card as a way to offset the library's $3.6-million annual operating 
budget.He estimated that nearly 70% of the 500,000 books and videos checked out 
last year were to people who did not live in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with a lingering recession and dwindling city revenues, the council also 
asked Steinfeld to evaluate the consequences of withdrawing the library's 
membership in the Metropolitan Cooperative Library System, an association of 
libraries in Los Angeles County. Libraries such as Beverly Hills, Santa Monica 
and Los Angeles provide free library cards to non-residents who live in 
communities served by a member library. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beverly Hills library, which is open daily, has been used heavily by 
people from other cities partly because many libraries in the system have had 
to cut operating hours because of budget cuts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Steinfeld urged the council to seek other remedies to the library's 
problem because of the financial and social risks of issuing entry cards. 
</P>
<P>
 An entry card is "politically and socially fraught with difficulties," 
Steinfeld said. He pointed out the experience of the Denver Public Library, 
which encountered a strong public backlash after it instituted a $10 daily pass 
fee in 1981 for people from other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Allan L. Alexander also noted that fixed costs such as salaries, 
more than users, determine operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-story library, which opened in September, 1990, is run by a 110-member 
staff, including 30 full-time employees. G. JEANETTE AVENT

COVER STORY; OPERATING ANEW; THE EARTHQUAKE PUT PLANS FOR RESTRUCTURING AT ST. 
JOHN'S HOSPITAL ON FAST FORWARD, BUT WORKERS WHO LOST THEIR JOBS QUESTION THE 
COST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It had become one of the Los Angeles area's best-known hospitals: home to the 
John Wayne Cancer Institute, the Joyce Eisenberg Keefer Breast Center and -- 
yes, on occasion -- to such celebrity patients as Liz Taylor and Michael 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the Jan. 17 earthquake. Because of what happened in those fateful 31 
seconds, St. John's Hospital -- Santa Monica's biggest employer and arguably 
among the country's highest-profile health centers -- must suddenly reinvent 
itself. The temblor opened severe structural cracks along the length of the 
hospital's main building and devastated the north wing, prompting the closure 
of all inpatient services and the furlough of 1,750 of St. John's 2,050 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply replacing broken buildings isn't enough, St. John's officials say. With 
U.S. medicine moving toward a more cost-conscious system of managed care, the 
hospital has decided it must fundamentally restructure itself, making 
adjustments immediately that it had planned to phase in over a decade or more. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, the earthquake has helped St. John's administrators in that 
task, giving them a freer hand, for instance, to make two such changes -- 
paring the payroll and emphasizing outpatient care. Largely due to the quake, 
hospital officials also may consider consolidating certain services -- and 
perhaps even a merger -- with Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aside from the people-pain that is very real and tragic, St. John's has been 
dealt a hand of four aces to better serve the community," said Bruce Lamoureux, 
the hospital's chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But that's small consolation to employees whose jobs have been lost. Because 
St. John's appears likely to rebuild itself in a dramatically different image, 
many of these workers fear they may never be part of the hospital's new health 
care plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some employees accuse the hospital of being overzealous in its 
post-earthquake cost-cutting plans. They question the assurances by 
administrators that the hospital will rehire as many former employees as 
possible to re-create the family spirit and nurturing care that have won St. 
John's a reputation for outstanding inpatient services. 
</P>
<P>
 "They used this to get rid of expensive labor," said a nurse with more than 10 
years at St. John's, who asked to remain anonymous. "I am really upset and 
angry. Why the hell would they hire me with 10 years' experience and five weeks 
of vacation a year over someone at entry-level pay?" 
</P>
<P>
 St. John's has long been considered a leading hospital, and not just because 
it has cared for celebrity patients. Besides serving as home to the John Wayne 
Cancer Institute and the Joyce Eisenberg Keefer Breast Center, it has highly 
respected orthopedics, cardiology and obstetrics and gynecological units, among 
other services. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is one of the best hospitals in L.A. County and, in fact, in the world, 
because people come from all over for treatment," said David Langness, vice 
president of the Hospital Council of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, St. John's -- which is operated by the Sisters of Charity of 
Leavenworth, a Kansas-based Roman Catholic order -- had already begun reshaping 
itself before the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital occupancy rates have dropped steadily in California since the 1950s, 
and St. John's 501-bed facility had been operating at 50% capacity for some 
time. That trend has accelerated over the years with the increased use of 
outpatient surgery. And it is expected to continue under the health reform 
initiatives proposed by the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long before the earthquake, administrators offered a buyout program 
through which employees could retire early and receive a severance benefit. 
Seventy-nine employees signed up for the program, called the Very Special 
Person's Package. In another cost-cutting move, the hospital had begun "labor 
pooling" both licensed and unlicensed staff so they could perform a variety of 
tasks. Respiratory care therapists were cross-trained in non-licensed nursing 
functions such as electrocardiograms and phlebotomy. Laundry and patient 
transport staff were also cross-trained, with resulting wage increases. 
</P>
<P>
 And St. John's has been at the forefront of efforts to offer outpatient -- 
rather than more expensive inpatient -- care. 
</P>
<P>
 As long ago as the late '70s, it opened an ambulatory care center -- the first 
in Los Angeles County -- prompting industry specialists to dub Sister Marie 
Madeleine Shonka, president and chief executive officer of St. John's, a health 
care "visionary." 
</P>
<P>
 To expand such services, the hospital last year proposed building a 
1,100-square-foot ambulatory care center just across Santa Monica Boulevard 
that would have featured a surgery center, magnetic resonance imaging, 
radiation oncology, CAT scans and other imaging. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We, like all other providers, were looking at how the health care reform 
package, the market and the ultimate government-involved product was going to 
affect St. John's for the future," Lamoureux said. "We were doing a number of 
substantial reconfigurations of the way things were being done at the 
hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital had hoped to make such changes seamlessly over seven to 10 years, 
but the earthquake has forced an immediate restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 The temblor caused an estimated $20 million in damage to the hospital, which 
includes a main building and four wings. The north wing, which housed neonatal 
intensive care, obstetrics, a nursery, a chemical dependency center, 
transitional care and medical-surgical beds, has been condemned. The main 
building, site of administrative offices and the maternity ward, was severely 
damaged and must be repaired, although the offices remain in use. The South 
Wing was damaged but is scheduled to reopen in August, after repairs are 
complete, with about 150 inpatient beds. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake forced the evacuation of about 300 patients. About 200 were checked 
into nearby hospitals and 100 were sent home. 
</P>
<P>
 But the harshest effect of St. John's closing, all agree, has been on 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 7, some 1,750 employees lost their jobs -- the vast majority of them 
nurses, physical therapists, lab technicians and such support staffers as 
registry clerks, custodians, food-, laundry- and patient-transport employees 
and security guards. 
</P>
<P>
 The employees were given a graduated severance package, with health benefits 
through April and wages through Feb. 5, even though the hospital closed Jan. 
20. A $300 cash bonus was paid to those who worked during the earthquake and 
evacuation. About 250 employees were retained to run the hospital's outpatient 
services in the still-functioning west and east wings. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, administrators told employees they would not be given priority over 
other applicants for future jobs and that, if rehired, they would not retain 
their seniority. After weeks of employee complaints, however, the 
administrators backed down on both counts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the severed employees have landed on their feet, finding work at 
surrounding hospitals including Santa Monica Hospital, UCLA Medical Center, 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Brotman Medical Center in Culver City and Century 
City Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those jobs are temporary, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Intensive-care nurse Mary Tomassini, a 34-year veteran of St. John's nicknamed 
"Big Red," found temporary work at Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital in Marina del 
Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost my complete family," said Tomassini, who has already reapplied for a 
job at St. John's. "It's been my whole life. It's like a marriage. You go back 
to patch things up." 
</P>
<P>
 Tomassini now earns $1,224 for a 50-hour week, just a shade less than her St. 
John's pay of $1,228.80 for the same hours. But like the other 15 nurses who 
took temporary jobs at Daniel Freeman Marina, she no longer has benefits such 
as a health plan or vacation pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Some nurses have fared worse. 
</P>
<P>
 A nursing supervisor, who asked not to be identified, said she now finds 
herself applying for jobs that pay $23 an hour, compared to the $30 an hour she 
received at St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many hospitals are cutting back on nurses because of health care reform. And 
because of the increase in outpatient services, they are using vocational 
nurses and nurses' aides," she said. "That is what they were doing at St. 
John's. They were using vocational nurses and aides after the buyout. . . . 
I've been looking for a job since the earthquake, collecting unemployment and 
worrying about my mortgage." 
</P>
<P>
 About a third of the terminated jobs at St. John's belonged to 
non-professional staffers. Lamoureux said these workers will probably have the 
hardest time finding employment because their jobs revolve largely around 
inpatient care, which is being reduced as hospitals move to boost outpatient 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 After a recent St. John's employee meeting in the courtyard, Elia Martinez, a 
34-year employee in the hospital's laundry, was not heartened by what she had 
heard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am afraid they are going to hire new employees with no insurance (and) no 
benefits because it is cheaper," she said. "All of my life I have had only this 
job. It's hard (for me) to look for work someplace else." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors with privileges at St. John's have also been affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Michael Lieber, a pulmonary disease and critical-care specialist who is 
called in as a consultant by physicians, is part of a group practice whose 
medical offices are next to St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to use four hospitals," Lieber said. "Now we are operating out of 
eight. It's a lot of driving time and it gets tiring, especially with the 
freeways still down. St. John's is a preferred hospital with good critical-care 
specialists. I hope it's up and running a soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Jon Matsunaga, an obstetrician whose physicians group has a medical office 
next door to St. John's, said he is concerned that the hospital's entire 
obstetrics and gynecological ward might be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the ward is rebuilt, Matsunaga worries that future cost-cutting might 
hurt the hospital's much-admired nursing care. 
</P>
<P>
 "We prefer St. John's," said Matsunaga, a member of the St. John's obstetrics 
and gynecological executive committee. "And one of the reasons, we explain to 
our patients, is that the nursing care is exceptional." 
</P>
<P>
 Matsunaga also fears a scaled-down St. John's could limit local residents' 
health care options. The quake, he said, has underscored the potential for such 
a problem by interrupting hospital service both at St. John's and at nearby 
Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center, which is functioning at less than half 
its capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 "St. John's closing is having a major impact on the community," he said. "To 
lose one-and-a-half hospitals is leaving (the community) without medical care." 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Marie Madeleine said St. John's will never again employ the 2,050 staff 
it once had. She said it is unlikely the staff will ever exceed 1,000, but said 
the downsizing will not compromise care. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the challenge of a new life," she said. "To build the hospital of the 
future, to meet the community needs and have the flexibility to do it. It may 
be smaller. But it will be better." 
</P>
<P>
 Although plans for the ambulatory care center have been dashed with the 
earthquake, administrators have fast-forwarded their once-distant plans to 
convert some of the hospital's towers to outpatient facilities. Also being 
discussed is construction of a cluster of free-standing outpatient clinics that 
would offer dentistry, outpatient surgery and radiation oncology, among other 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the final plan, it will likely be shaped with help from Santa Monica 
Hospital Medical Center, once a fierce competitor of St. John's. Administrators 
from the two hospitals have already begun brainstorming about the possibility 
of joining forces, among other proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica Hospital suffered an estimated $15 million in quake damage, 
losing more than half of its 365 inpatient beds. Repairs are expected to be 
complete in October. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a little touchy in the sense that these two hospitals have had a very 
long history of being competitive," said William D. Parente, president and 
chief executive officer of Santa Monica Hospital. "Maybe there can be one grand 
hospital in the community. I hope we don't just rebuild these hospitals to 
mirror each other. We're willing to say, 'OK, we'll hold off doing anything 
until we see what should be done overall for the community.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That process could bring major changes if local hospitals heed Leland Kaiser, 
a professor of hospital administration at the University of Colorado at Denver 
and a well-known futurist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Expect your patient census to drop another 30%," Kaiser said in a recent talk 
to the St. John's and Santa Monica Hospital staffs. "Our challenge now is to 
move into health education, ambulatory care, prevention and into the 
neighborhoods to get to know your community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now is the time to think about a hospital without walls. The Lord just 
brought the roof down. And a few years from now, I think you will be saying it 
was the best thing that happened to you."

'ANNIE' IS NO ORPHAN TO LIGHT OPERA FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Civic light opera companies from the mountains to the sea thrive on musical 
chestnuts from the '40s and '50s. Any show newer than that is a risky 
calculation. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is "Annie," currently at the Downey Civic Light Opera, a 1977 
Broadway hit that's as contemporary as it gets on the CLO circuit. Of course, 
its popularity rests with its Depression-era setting and 1930s optimism. Based 
on the "Little Orphan Annie" comic strip, the show is almost indestructible. 
</P>
<P>
 The Downey Civic Light Opera, which celebrates its 40th birthday this fall, 
has charmingly revived "Annie's" patch of "Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?" 
nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning with Laura Ware's mean, hilarious orphanage keeper through fetching 
Kari D. Pickler's Annie to Mike Jacobson's gleaming, bald-pated Daddy Warbucks, 
the Downey production merrily trips along with the easy, sidewalk confidence of 
a game of hopscotch -- unless you count the rather tinny orchestrations and a 
very aging, huffing-puffing Sandy as Annie's lovable "Hooverville" mutt 
(Tootsie in real life). 
</P>
<P>
 Managing a pair of "arfs" at the curtain, Tootsie steals the show despite 
galumphing about on a bum leg and literally coming out of dog retirement after 
performing Sandy from Pasadena to La Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
 W.C. Fields, of course, warned about the scene-stealing antics of dogs and 
children, which makes "Annie" the veritable war zone of American musicals. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what makes orphan mistress Ware's tippling, terrorizing Miss Hannigan 
(created by Dorothy Loudon on Broadway and later by Carol Burnett in the 
otherwise ponderous '82 movie version) and Pickler's luminous, pearly voiced 
Annie such accomplishments. Pickler, who's 14, is favored with an unusually 
grown-up face, turning her 11-year old, round-faced comic strip character into 
a Beverly Hills-looking Annie for the '90s -- certainly an Annie you've never 
quite seen before. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a show, (book by Thomas Meehan, music by Charles Strouse, lyrics by 
Martin Charnin) that often seems more simple than Hal Gray's original strip. 
That's part of its pleasure. The other part, under George Strattan's solid 
direction, is the essentially unsentimental nature of the show, a no-nonsense 
approach that was initially produced and largely developed by Mike Nichols, of 
all people. 
</P>
<P>
 We're in updated Dickens' country -- a kind of reverse "Oliver Twist," where a 
waif finds love and happiness with a munitions maker (Warbucks) in a towering 
New York mansion full of green-vested servants who break into songs like "You 
Won't Be an Orphan for Long." (The flavorful sets and costumes are pickups and 
rentals from surrounding theatrical service companies and they effectively 
mirror the original Broadway designs). 
</P>
<P>
 The knockout musical numbers are "Tomorrow" (in which Annie encourages FDR's 
weary Cabinet to look to the future), "Hard-Knock Life" (featuring eight 
raggedy orphan girls) and the infectious "Easy Street" (in which a devious 
couple ripely played by Mark Clark and Kimberly Clark masquerade as Annie's 
parents). 
</P>
<P>
 Contributing vivid supporting portraits are Fred Derbyshire's wheelchair-bound 
FDR with his characteristically pointed spear of a cigarette holder, and 
Christine Martin's serenely understated Warbucks' secretary who invites Annie 
to the billionaire's home, setting the plot in motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, shantytown depictions of the '30s homeless -- nicely offset by 
Annie's wide-eyed innocence -- unexpectedly serve up unnerving reminders of 
contemporary, down-and-out Los Angeles. 
</P>

Saturday, 8 p.m.; Saturday, Sunday matinees, 2:30 p.m. Through March 6.

 GOING, GOING GONE 
</P>
<P>
 Professional baseball players Bobby Holley and Nikco Riesgo had been toying 
with the idea for several few years. 
</P>
<P>
 They wanted to stage a competition similar to the "Home Run Derby" television 
series of the 1950s, which matched baseball greats such as Mickey Mantle and 
Ernie Banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, their dreams will come true. 
</P>
<P>
 The players, who are products of Long Beach youth baseball programs, have 
organized a home run derby at 2 p.m. at Blair Field in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Holley, who played for the Seattle Mariner triple-A affiliate in Calgary of 
the Pacific Coast League, and Riesgo, who plays in the Detroit Tiger farm 
system, will compete against each other. Both players are graduates of Hughes 
Junior High in Long Beach and Long Beach Poly High. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission is $10 and proceeds will go toward youth baseball in the Long Beach 
area and also help to promote youth baseball awareness. During the competition, 
the players will each take nine pitches an inning in a nine-inning contest. 
</P>
<P>
 There will also be entertainment, including musical performers, between 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Riesgo said they are hoping to stage the competition as an annual event. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to keep it going," he said. "Back in the old days, it was good 
fun for America and good for baseball. It's also something that's good for the 
kids growing up, so it should be a fun event once a year." 
</P>
<P>
 They are hoping the event grows next year and are optimistic they can attract 
two major league standouts to compete against each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have verbal interest from David Justice (of the Atlanta Braves) and Frank 
Thomas (of the Chicago White Sox), and if we could get them to come out that 
would really get this going," Riesgo said. SECOND BEST 
</P>
<P>
 With its chances of winning the Big West Conference having nearly vanished, 
the Long Beach State men's basketball team will set its sights on second place 
when it plays two conference home games this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The first is at 9 tonight against Big West leader New Mexico State. On 
Saturday at 8 p.m., the 49ers play host to traditional conference power Nevada 
Las Vegas. New Mexico State is 19-3 and 11-2 in the Big West and UNLV is 11-11 
and 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach (14-8, 8-6) is tied for third in the conference with San Jose 
State. The teams trail second-place Pacific by a game. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers lost to New Mexico State, 94-76, and UNLV, 68-61, in the first round 
of conference play. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach was led by guard Rod Hannibal in the first game against New Mexico 
State. Hannibal and forward Mike Atkinson have been the team's top offensive 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers are coming off a surprisingly easy 80-58 nonconference win over 
Memphis State on Monday. They lost to Utah State and defeated Nevada in Big 
West road games last week. PREPS 
</P>
<P>
 The official opening of the Southern Section track and field season is not 
until Monday, but many Southeast/Long Beach athletes appeared in midseason form 
in the high school portion of the 35th annual Sunkist Invitational indoor track 
meet on Saturday at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The most impressive team was the Long Beach Poly girls, the two-time defending 
state champions, who sparkled in the sprint events. Leading the way was Andrea 
Anderson, one of the top sprinters in the state last season. She won the 
50-meter dash with a time of 6.54 seconds. Teammate Aisha Washington won her 
heat of the 500-yard run in 1 minute 11.7 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Also finishing among the leaders in their events were Poly's Pam Simpson in 
the 500, Sherron Rhetta in the 880, Erin O'Keefe in the rated mile, Aminah 
Haddad in the 50 and Savant Williams in the high jump. The Jackrabbits also 
posted the fastest time of 10:10.1 in three heats of the 4x880 relay. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other top finishers among the girls were Gahr's Stacy Edwards in the 880 
and Miesha McKelvey in the 50-meter hurdles. McKelvey won her race in 7.68 
seconds, the fastest of three heats. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most impressive boy in the meet was Michael Granville of Bell 
Gardens, who established a meet record and a national record for a sophomore 
with his time of 57.7 seconds in the 500. He also came back to finish second in 
the seeded 880 in 2:00.70. 
</P>
<P>
 Akinya Taylor of Dominguez was another standout, winning his heat of the 50 in 
6.04 seconds. He finished just ahead of Poly's Damien Murphy (6.07). 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Although their cross-town rivals were having a big day at the Sunkist 
Invitational, the Long Beach Wilson girls traveled to the Simplot Games at 
Pocatello, Ida., and didn't leave disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins, who could be one of Poly's chief obstacles in its path toward 
another title, were strong as usual in the sprints. Lakiesha Backus, one of the 
state's top sprinters last year, was fourth in the 55 meters with a time of 
7.22 seconds and was among a foursome from Wilson who ran the 800-meter relay 
in 1:43.07 -- third fastest time in the nation this year. COMMUNITY COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach City and Cerritos colleges have been seeded among the top 10 teams 
in the community college men's basketball Southern California regionals that 
start at 7 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach (26-6), which won its third South Coast Conference title in the 
past four seasons last week, is seeded No. 2 in the 32-team regional and will 
play host to No. 31 Mt. San Jacinto (15-15). The Vikings clinched the 
conference title with a 112-74 win over El Camino last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerritos (25-6), which finished second in the South Coast, is seeded ninth and 
will play host to No. 24 Santa Monica (20-10). 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura (31-2) is the top-seeded team in the regionals. BRIEFLY 
</P>
<P>
 The Cerritos Artesia Little League's Challenger Division, which enables 
physically and mentally handicapped youths to play baseball, will receive a 
$5,000 grant from the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles during the 
league's opening day ceremony at 10:30 a.m. Saturday at Cerritos Park East in 
Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds will be used to purchase new uniforms and equipment for Challenger 
Division players. The grant was among $1,049,956 in funds that was awarded by 
the foundation's board of directors in January.

WATER: TAPPING THE WRONG SOURCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In your Westside Watch of Jan. 30, you had an article about the water problems 
in Beverly Hills in 1923.You mentioned that Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford 
were instrumental in keeping the water system in the city of Beverly Hills, 
rather than incorporating it with the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 You printed photographs of Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. 
accompanying the article. However, it was Douglas Fairbanks Sr. who was helpful 
in (resolving) that problem. 
</P>
<P>
 But I must say -- the photograph of Douglas Fairbanks Jr. is indeed a handsome 
one!

HOMELESS: SANTA MONICA'S RECORD OF CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In regards to the article (Jan. 23) entitled "Camp Santa Monica" I must 
respond in the following manner. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Santa Monica seems to think that they have done so much for the 
homeless in their city, yet to date the record seems to say otherwise.To date 
they have: 
</P>
<P>
 1) Barred the homeless from libraries and other public places; 
</P>
<P>
 2) Harassed or closed several food lines that were attempting to help the 
homeless; 
</P>
<P>
 3) Passed an ordinance making it illegal to sleep in the park or gather in 
large numbers; 
</P>
<P>
 4) Fired the city attorney, Robert Myers, who wanted to prosecute real 
criminals instead of the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 With this record, I wonder what they are going to do about the "new" homeless 
that are in Santa Monica because of the earthquake. These people were their 
neighbors and friends. Are they going to harass and push them aside, as they 
have the "old" homeless? Will they receive the help that they need, or will 
they suffer the same intolerance and disdain that the previous homeless have 
received? 
</P>
<P>
 I believe that the city of Santa Monica needs to find its heart and conscience 
in dealing with all of the homeless, old or new. The same time and effort that 
they put into trying to "rid" Santa Monica of the homeless could be used in 
more constructive and positive endeavors.

OUT AND ABOUT / IGBY'S: TAKING A COMEDY DETOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA V. GODBEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For commuters who are fed up with the post-earthquake congestion, Igby's 
Comedy Cabaret in West Los Angeles provides an enticing detour -- an afternoon 
"Rush Hour Comedy Break." 
</P>
<P>
 Stand-up comedians volunteer their time at the comedy breaks, which usually 
feature four performers per hour.Routines last five to 15 minutes, and the 
performers -- and the jokes -- are diverse. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good environment to try out new material," said comedian Charlie 
Marco, who drives from Burbank to do his routine. "There is no real pressure, 
and it helps me out." 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Jan Smith, who started Igby's more than a decade ago, thought people 
needed a good laugh after the earthquake. He figured that because traffic 
conditions have worsened on the Westside, the comedy break might help get 
people off the road and provide some laughs too. 
</P>
<P>
 Commuters can soothe frazzled nerves from 5 to 7 p.m. Thursday and Friday 
evenings. Food and beverages are also available. There is no cover charge or 
minimum purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard about (Igby's) from a friend," said 29-year-old Carlos Narro of Los 
Angeles. "It was a good idea and I come here as much as I can." 
</P>
<P>
 Igby's, 11637 W. Pico Blvd., West Los Angeles (310) 477-3553. Rush-hour 
performances are from 5 to 7 p.m., Thursday and Friday evenings. CHRISTINA V.

EDUCATION: PREPARING FOR A SCHOOL MEDICAL EMERGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LAINE YARBER, Mary Laine Yarber teaches English at Santa Monica High 
School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A school nurse's job may seem routine and simple. But this time of year, with 
cold and flu season in full swing, many school nurses have their hands full 
examining sick students and sending them home. 
</P>
<P>
 Something else compounds the hectic pace: a lack of basic information from 
parents about their children. If you've got a child in school, there are some 
things your school nurse or health officer should know in case of an illness or 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 At most schools, each student must fill out some kind of emergency card in 
order to register for class. The card generally lists parents' names, 
addresses, and phone numbers, and some other basic information. 
</P>
<P>
 Such records are often inaccurate because children are in a hurry to enroll 
and make mistakes filling out their cards. As a result, it may not be possible 
to reach a student's parents in an emergency because their work phone numbers 
are wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearing up such dangerous errors and providing thorough emergency information 
about your child is easy. And it's never too late to add this information to 
your child's file. Just telephone the school to find out what information is on 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 Make sure several important phone numbers are included. Obviously, your home 
and work numbers should be among them, but also add the home and work numbers 
of at least two friends or relatives in case you're unavailable in an 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 If a number corresponds to a beeper or pager, be sure to provide instructions 
for its use. Not all pager services provide recorded instructions and not all 
of them work the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 Include the name and phone number of your child's physician or other health 
care professional and the name, address, and phone number of a preferred 
hospital. If your child is covered by medical insurance, give the school a 
photocopy of your policy card. 
</P>
<P>
 Your children's medical history is also important for the school, so make it 
thorough. Make a note of any vision or hearing problems, as well as any 
correctional equipment that your child may use at school -- such as eye glasses 
or a hearing aid. 
</P>
<P>
 If your child takes any sort of medication, make sure the school health 
officer knows what the medicine is and how often it is administered. In some 
cases, particularly if the child is very young, you may prefer to have the 
staff keep the medicine and administer it, rather than the student. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical history should also mention any allergies your child has, whether 
these are due to food, medicine, or atmospheric conditions. Add to the health 
file any serious illnesses your child has had, and any surgeries or chronic 
health problems that may limit activities. 
</P>
<P>
 If your child is currently exposed to a contagious illness -- such as flu or 
bronchitis from a family member -- notify the school at once. 
</P>
<P>
 And, finally, please keep your child out of school there are any symptoms of a 
contagious illness. Although many parents send sick children to school because 
they want to avoid missed schoolwork, state laws guarantee that students can 
make up the work for full credit. There's no reason to make other students and 
teachers ill. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information on how to ensure that your child's health records will be 
adequate in case of emergency, contact the campus nurse or administrator.

REGIONAL REPORT; REDONDO BEACH; DRIVEN TO DESIGN AWARDS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Drawing pictures of hot rods and motorcycles used to earn Jim Searcy nothing 
but trouble in his 12th-grade English class 40 years ago. Today, it earns him a 
living. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner of a small glass decoration shop in Redondo Beach, Searcy designs 
trophies for automobile and motorcycle races across the country.The awards, 
which sell for as much as $8,000 each, contain intricate, three-dimensional 
images of cars and drivers sandblasted into sheets of glass. 
</P>
<P>
 For Searcy, 57, of Hermosa Beach, pairing his interests in racing and art has 
been profitable. Last year, his one-man workshop, Champ Awards, had sales of 
almost $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Motor racing has always been my love," Searcy said. "So it kind of went

REGIONAL REPORT; PICO-UNION; BILINGUAL AIDES EASE FEMA TASK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Federal Emergency Management Agency set up shop after the Northridge 
earthquake, it was confronted by thousands of confused and frightened 
residents. For residents who don't speak English, that confusion is compounded 
by a sense of helplessness. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where Jose Monge came in. 
</P>
<P>
 With thousands of Spanish-speaking residents unable to adequately communicate 
their concerns, the call went out to 44 bilingual FEMA workers based in Puerto 
Rico. As he has in past disasters, Monge flew out at a moment's notice with 
other workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've worked about seven disasters, including this earthquake," said Monge, 
who was assigned to a FEMA location at the Toberman Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Jan. 17 temblor, more than 500 FEMA workers have been flown in from 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 1,100 workers have been hired locally by FEMA's Region 9 -- which 
includes California -- since the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 For residents of Pico-Union and Westlake left homeless by the quake, disaster 
assistance centers staffed by bilingual personnel continue to be vital. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in jeans and print shirt, Monge listened recently to a woman whose 
apartment was red-tagged, barring her from entering her building. Another 
worker explained that the woman has been unable to receive housing assistance 
because of a paperwork mix-up that lists the apartment as being inhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is typical," Monge said, instructing another worker to contact building 
inspectors. "Every day we have people who don't know what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,500 applications have been processed at the center in the heart of 
the predominantly Central American community.

 PROMISING START 
</P>
<P>
 St. Bernard High freshman Malika Edmonson injured her hip and was a late 
scratch from the 500-yard event at Saturday's Sunkist Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 But Edmonson did run the anchor for an all-freshmen St. Bernard girls' 4x440 
relay team and led it to a second-place finish in a time of 4 minutes 3.7 
seconds. Morningside won the race in 3:56.9. The Vikings ran the second-fastest 
time of the day in the six heats. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Edmonson, ninth-graders Regine Caruther, Roshanna Payne and 
Myleik Teele also ran in the relay. The four freshmen are national age-group 
record-holders in the 12- and 14-year-old divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 640-yard relay, the Vikings, led by Edmonson, finished in 1:16.1 and 
were second to Etiwanda (1:15.8) in their heat. It was the third-fastest time 
overall. HISTORY LESSON 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five years ago, Beverly Hills won its first and only Southern Section 
basketball championship by defeating Santa Maria, 74-62. The starting lineup 
consisted of present coach Jason Newman, shooting guard Jim Tough, forwards Ed 
Burris and Ed Carmen, and center Rick Caesar, the son of comedian Sid Caesar. 
</P>
<P>
 Among their biggest games was a five-overtime victory against Aviation. The 
Normans (26-5) did lose to Ventura in the finals of the Beverly Hills 
tournament. Ventura was led by Keith Wilkes, who later changed his first name 
to Jamaal and played for UCLA and the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Normans hoped to repeat history this season with one of the area's top 
centers in Luke Buffum. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Normans failed to get past the first round of Southern Section 
Division II-AA playoffs, losing to Gahr, 48-37. 
</P>
<P>
 The Normans shot only 38% from the field to account for their season-low point 
total. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to give Gahr credit, they defended us very well," Newman said. "For 
whatever reason, we came out tentative. I don't know what the story was." 
</P>
<P>
 The Normans' biggest loss will come in June when the 6-foot-7 Buffum 
graduates. Rarely do the Normans get a mobile big man such as Buffum, who was 
The Times' 1993 Westside Player of the Year. He averaged 22 points and 8.5 
rebounds, shooting 60% from the field and 80% from the free-throw line. He also 
made 16 of 28 three-point attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally speaking, we don't get real tall kids," Newman said. "As valuable 
as his contributions were on the court, he made an even bigger contribution as 
a real leader off the court and in the locker room. He was really a popular 
player on the team and he never let (publicity) get to his head." NOT A BAD 
SEED 
</P>
<P>
 Although Fairfax was 1-1 against Coastal Conference rival Westchester, Lion 
Coach Harvey Kitani doesn't think his team deserved to be seeded ahead of the 
Comets. 
</P>
<P>
 Westchester, which has won the City 4-A Division title two of the past three 
seasons, was seeded second behind defending champion Crenshaw. Fairfax was not 
among the four seeded 4-A teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Westchester) had a really good preseason and played as well as anyone in 
league," Kitani said. "They also beat the teams that were seeded below them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions beat Westchester, 77-72, in the Coastal Conference finale on 
Thursday at Fairfax. It was a big morale boost for the Lions (20-5), who have 
lost close games to Westchester and St. John Bosco. 
</P>
<P>
 "The five games we lost we had a chance to win, but we fell short in different 
phases of the game," Kitani said. "We needed to knock off a team with a high 
ranking to give our guys confidence going into the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions played host to Grant on Wednesday. A victory would place Fairfax in 
a Friday game against the winner of the Palisades-Fremont game. PLAYOFF PRIMED 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Bernard boys' basketball team figures its season does not start until 
playoff time. 
</P>
<P>
 After another disappointing finish in the Mission League, the Vikings have 
rebounded to win their first two playoff games, defeating Murphy, 72-58, and 
Fillmore, 75-45. Last season the Vikings finished in fourth place but advanced 
to the Southern Section Division IV-AA final, losing to Corona del Mar, 47-46. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do the Vikings struggle in league play, then play like champions in the 
playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
 "There are two components to that question," St. Bernard Coach Jim McClune 
said. "First, our league is pretty strong. Second, our playoff bracket is not. 
Put those two things together and we're a pretty good team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings (14-11) play St. Paul (15-11) in the semifinals Friday at El 
Rancho High. The Swordsmen beat St. Bernard, 70-61, in a nonleague game Dec. 
21. 
</P>
<P>
 Four players -- Nnaemeka Okoye, Darren Harris, Sanford Howie and Tim Blackwell 
-- missed the game because of the flu. 
</P>
<P>
 "We suited up seven kids and still gave them a pretty good run," McClune said. 
</P>
<P>
 Okoye, cousin of former Kansas City Chief running back Christian Okoye, has 
averaged 11 points a game during the past 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole playoff system can resurrect your season," McClune said. 
"Normally, when you finished fourth in league, it's not a positive occurrence. 
But we played in the championship game and we are on the verge of doing that 
again." STOPPING TOP GUN 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Hills, which defeated Riverside Bethel Christian, 75-57, on Tuesday, 
will play Santa Maria Valley Christian on Friday in the Division V-A semifinals 
at Santa Maria. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Maria Valley Christian is led by junior Chad Bickley, who made headlines 
earlier this month by scoring 89 points against Cuyama Valley in Coast Valley 
League game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were there scouting the game," Pacific Hills Coach John Bobich said. "Half 
of his shots were NBA threes." 
</P>
<P>
 Bobich has been busy preparing his team's defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would play man-to-man defense and switch on every pick to keep him from 
getting the open shot. There is no way he should even get 30 points against 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Maria Valley Christian beat Liberty Christian, 89-73, on Tuesday. 
Bickley scored 25 points in the victory. HONORS 
</P>
<P>
 The Crossroads girls' basketball team had five players selected to the Delphic 
League first team. Junior guard Sherrise Smith who averaged 20.8 points in 
league, was chosen most valuable player. Also selected were junior forward Erin 
Irving, junior forward Yasmeen Yamini-Benjamin, junior center Halima Cotwright 
and senior guard Tamiko Hairston. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore guard Jenny Ho of Brentwood was the only other area player selected 
to the first team. 
</P>
<P>
 Selected to the second team were Crossroads senior forwards Allison Shapiro 
and Linda Ripoll. LOPSIDED WIN 
</P>
<P>
 Despite winning the game by 90 points, St. Bernard Coach Lori Pawinski insists 
she didn't try to run up the score against Whitney on Saturday in the first 
round of the IV-AA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Marte Alexander, who had 22 points, led eight Vikings who scored in 
double-figures in the 106-16 win over Whitney.

 BUZZ: Former astronaut Buzz Aldrin of Laguna Beach heads back into space 
tonight on "The Simpsons." In this episode, NASA chooses Homer to be the first 
average American in space, and Aldrin accompanies him. . . . The popular TV 
cartoon show is "not in my regular repertoire," admits Aldrin, whose voice and 
cartoon image are featured. He is now writing a science-fiction book about 
space travel. "Who knows?" he says. "The aliens could look like the Simpsons, 
though more advanced."

 PLAY NO MORE: Ingram Micro Inc., the worldwide computer distributor in Santa 
Ana, has a policy of not carrying any adult software. Uh, unless by accident. . 
. . PC Week magazine recently discovered that Ingram was distributing copies of 
Playboy's electronic date book last year -- including risque photos of women. A 
spokeswoman told PC Week it had no idea "just how adult" the material was. The 
company says it withdrew the products from distribution once the error was 
discovered.

 MARATHON MAN: The Festival of Whales opens Friday in Dana Point (OC Live!), 
and as might be expected, Laguna Beach-based marine life painter Wyland will be 
part of the action. He'll be honored at a reception Sunday at the Dana Point 
Resort. . . . Wyland, known for painting life-size whale murals around the 
world, plans a whale-painting marathon to begin in August: eight murals in 
eight West Coast cities in eight weeks. . . . His goal is 100 "Whaling Walls" 
by the year 2011.

 HIGH MARKS: Orange County's own state Sen. Marian Bergeson and Assemblyman Tom 
Umberg scored big in California Journal's recent biennial survey ranking state 
legislators. . . . Newport Beach's Bergeson was ranked fourth overall in the 
Senate, and was the highest-scoring Republican in the survey of legislators, 
their staffs, lobbyists and journalists. Umberg, a Garden Grove Democrat 
running for state attorney general, finished 10th in the 80-member Assembly.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: HOLDING THE AUDIENCE IN THE PALM OF HER HANDS -- ALL 
EIGHT OF THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 MIGHTY MOLLUSK: The newest resident of Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro 
settled into her new quarters this week, a 500-gallon tank with plenty of room 
for her eight sucker-lined arms. 
</P>
<P>
 The 58-pound giant Pacific octopus was eased into the tank Tuesday afternoon, 
becoming the first octopus of its kind to go on display at the city-owned 
aquarium. And the orange mollusk with a 12-foot tentacle span played to the 
audience, crawling around the tank bottom as the television cameras whirred. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was just a great performer. Quite a crowd pleaser," said exhibits 
director Mike Schaadt, who expects the octopus to attract plenty of visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The giant Pacific octopus normally resides in cooler waters off Japan, the 
Aleutian Islands and the Pacific Northwest. But this one was discovered by a 
San Pedro fisherman inside a lobster trap off San Clemente Island and found its 
way to the San Pedro Fish Market, which donated it to the aquarium. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the octopus remains unnamed.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure someone else will (name it). Someone will come up with Octavia or 
Orelei," said Schaadt. But Cabrillo Aquarium officials typically don't assign 
names to their marine tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're attached as it is," Schaadt explained. "We don't need to be any more 
attached."

 SO SUE ME: Before the stories even hit the newspapers, the trouble hit the fan 
for the top prosecutor in the district attorney's Torrance office. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week head Deputy Dist. Atty. Monika Blodgett met with reporters from The 
Times and the Daily Breeze and said she was being demoted and transferred to a 
non-supervisory job in the Santa Monica office because she had complained about 
some of her Torrance predecessors "giving away the courthouse" with too-lenient 
plea bargains in criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Her predecessor in the top slot in Torrance was none other than her boss, 
Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, whose 1992 campaign included promises he would halt 
overly generous plea bargains. 
</P>
<P>
 Blodgett, who retains a noticeable accent from her native Germany, also said 
she was being harassed because of her heritage, often being referred to by 
other D.A. office personnel as a "Nazi." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time she got home that evening, Blodgett said later, there was a 
message on her answering machine ordering her to report Downtown the next day. 
Apparently the D.A.'s office had been alerted to her remarks when reporters 
called the office for comment. The next morning Blodgett was suspended for one 
day and, she said, forbidden to return to the Torrance office. The grounds for 
the disciplinary action, she said, included "insubordination" and failing to 
report contacts with the media. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is outrageous," Blodgett, now a trial attorney in the Santa Monica 
branch of the district attorney's office, said this week. "Even D.A.'s have 1st 
Amendment rights." 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office has declined to comment, calling the 
disciplinary action a "personnel matter." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 SIGN OF THE TIMES: In an apparent nod to a changing economy, Torrance will 
rename an obscure street just south of the city airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The 350-foot street, which has been known as "Douglas Way," will now be called 
"Robinson Way" in honor of Robinson Helicopter Co., which has a new factory 
building slated to open in April. The street leads to the company's main 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Torrance City Council approved the change Tuesday night after receiving a 
request from Robinson Helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials believe the old street name honored Douglas Aircraft, which 
later became a subsidiary of recession-battered McDonnell Douglas. The 
air-related theme is repeated with other area street names, such as Curtiss 
Way, Bellanca Way and Fairchild Apron. Torrance-based Robinson Helicopter, 
meanwhile, has grown from relative obscurity into one of the more successful 
aircraft companies in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The change may go unnoticed by most city residents, since the street has only 
a single address: Torrance Fire Station No. 2.

 PLAY WORK: Parents of children at Walteria Elementary School in Torrance 
looked around last fall and saw that their children had a substandard 
playground. After 44 years of neglect, the swings had no seats, cushioning sand 
under the equipment had long washed away and the sandbox was mainly fare for 
termites. 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly an educational crisis, but hey, kids deserve a nice place to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The district did not have money for playground improvements and the PTA was 
trying to fund more urgent educational needs, so the parents began raising 
money. More than 100 families helped, as did local businesses, and together 
they put on a Halloween Golf Tournament, carnival booths and a raffle. In 
December, parents and friends shoveled, excavated, planted and painted to 
provide a wheelchair-accessible playhouse, an elevated sandbox, a mural of 
jungle animals and a new blacktop. They also converted a corner of the 
playground into a vegetable garden to be planted by the kindergartners and 
their teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort took 3,000 hours of work and $16,000 of donated materials. 
</P>

 QUOTE OF THE WEEK

SHOPPING CENTER GETS TENTATIVE OK; BUSINESS: DANNY BAKEWELL'S FIRM PLANS 
70,000-SQUARE-FOOT FACILITY IN NORTHWEST PASADENA. CITY WOULD SUBSIDIZE IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Pasadena City Council on Tuesday gave preliminary approval to a plan by 
developer and community activist Danny Bakewell to build a shopping center in 
Northwest Pasadena with the help of the city's redevelopment agency. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials and representatives of Bakewell's Pasadena Commercial 
Development Co. will meet to work out a formal agreement, which will go back to 
the City Council for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Both parties said they had cleared some major hurdles and were committed to 
developing the planned 70,000-square-foot shopping center at the southwest 
corner of the intersection of Fair Oaks Avenue and Orange Grove Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be the first "high-quality" shopping center in the predominantly 
black and Latino area, officials said. City officials and Bakewell said they 
hoped the center would spark an economic rebirth in one of the city's poorest 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very important project. It's a community-driven project," said 
Councilman Chris Holden, whose 3rd District includes the site of the proposed 
shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, it will set a precedent for development by other African 
Americans, Mexicans, people of color," said Bakewell, who is black. He heads 
the Los Angeles-based Brotherhood Crusade. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakewell said his company will spend about $5 million to build the center, 
which will include a Vons or similar supermarket and smaller stores. Bakewell 
has said the center is committed to employing area residents to fill about 250 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman William E. Thomson was the only council member to vote against the 
preliminary agreement. "I don't think economically it is a good arrangement for 
the city of Pasadena," Thomson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The redevelopment agency is expected to pay an estimated $10 million to buy 
about five acres of land for the shopping center, relocate existing businesses 
and demolish buildings on the site. Redevelopment officials are negotiating 
with two landowners to acquire the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The site is now home to a liquor and grocery market, a check-cashing store, a 
nail shop and other small stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The redevelopment agency will sell the property to Bakewell's firm for $1.5 
million, which the firm would repay over the next 20 years out of profits 
generated by the shopping center.

ELECTIONS; FLOYD, MCDONALD TO BE IN REMATCH FOR ASSEMBLY SEAT; LEGISLATURE: IN 
THE PRIMARY, 19 SOUTH BAY CANDIDATES ARE RUNNING FOR FIVE ASSEMBLY SEATS AND 
SEVEN FOR ONE SENATE SEAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The most hotly disputed South Bay primary race for the state Legislature this 
year may be a rematch between two Carson politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Juanita M. McDonald defeated incumbent Richard Floyd (D-Carson) 
in a bitter primary race for the 55th Assembly District seat. 
</P>
<P>
 She went on to win the seat in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
 Now their roles may be reversed. Floyd filed a declaration of intent to regain 
the seat from McDonald in this year's June 7 primary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just amazing to everyone: What is he coming back for?" said McDonald, 
whose district covers Carson, Wilmington and Compton. ". . . I'm not worried 
about him. I have the overwhelming support of many of his old constituents." 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 19 candidates are running for five Assembly seats and seven for one 
Senate seat in the South Bay. They have until March 11 to file their nomination 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans hope that at least one of their primary victors will break the 
Democrats' majority on the South Bay delegation in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we can pull it back this time," said California Republican Party 
spokesman John Peschong. "(The Democrats) are going to have a harder time than 
they think." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't expect a big Republican challenge in the 55th Assembly District, 
however. Democrats outnumber Republicans more than three to one. In fact, no 
Republicans are running in the primary, giving the Democratic victor a virtual 
lock on the general election. Libertarian Daniel Dalton is the only other 
candidate in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald's victory in 1992 was a stunning defeat for Floyd and Assemblyman 
Dave Elder (D-San Pedro), who chose to run in the 55th because his district had 
been redrawn substantially.  
</P>
<P>
 Floyd said when he lost that he planned to run again, but McDonald said she 
and others were puzzled when he filed his declaration papers earlier this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is baffled," McDonald said. "They ask, 'What is his problem? Can he 
get on with his life?' "  
</P>
<P>
 Floyd, however, has a purpose for returning. McDonald has tried to amend the 
state's motorcycle helmet law, which he calls one of his crowning 
accomplishments in 12 years in Sacramento. She sought a provision to allow 
motorcyclists 21 and older to choose whether to wear a helmet, but the measure 
did not pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got angry," Floyd said. "I spent a good number of years putting helmets on 
Hell's Angels. . . . There are some things so important to me. This was 
landmark legislation." 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald said that her changes in the law would have made it akin to the 
bicycle helmet law, which allows riders 18 and older to choose whether to wear 
a helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans, meanwhile, are trying to avoid repeating a bitter 1992 primary 
battle when six hopefuls vied for the party nomination in the 53rd Assembly 
District, which stretches from Venice to Lomita. The most conservative of the 
Republicans, Redondo Beach Mayor Brad Parton, won the race, but was defeated in 
the general election by environmental lawyer Debra Bowen. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, David Bohline and Julian Sirull, both insurance executives, will 
face off in the Republican primary. And party officials hope that in a district 
split evenly between Republicans and Democrats, their candidate can defeat 
Bowen (D-Marina del Rey).  
</P>
<P>
 "(Bowen's) going to be tough to beat," said Keith McCarthy, chairman of the 
county Republican Party. "We were surprised to lose last time. But absolutely, 
we will take that seat." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bowen said the lack of more experienced players in the race is a sign that 
Republicans do not want to invest in another expensive campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't any local council member running," she said. "Most people feel it 
is not worth the effort."  
</P>
<P>
 Some potential Republican candidates, including Bill Beverly, son of state 
Sen. Robert G. Beverly, chose not to run, McCarthy said. But Bohline hopes 
Republicans will get more enthusiastic about the race after the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Sirull could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans have lined up more familiar names to challenge Assemblywoman Betty 
Karnette (D-San Pedro), whose 54th District includes the Palos Verdes Peninsula 
and San Pedro. Running in the Republican primary are Rancho Palos Verdes Mayor 
Steve Kuykendall and Rolling Hills Estates restaurateur Jeffrey Earle, a former 
campaign treasurer for Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach). Libertarian 
Alan Carlan and Peace and Freedom candidate Patrick John McCoy also are 
running. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 51st Assembly District, which includes Hawthorne and Inglewood, 
incumbent Curtis R. Tucker Jr. (D-Inglewood) has no challengers in the 
Democratic primary. Adam Michelin is running unopposed for the Republican 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 52nd Assembly District, which includes part of Gardena, incumbent 
Willard H. Murray Jr. (D-Paramount) will face Stephen Hamlin and Patricia A. 
Moore in the primary. Republican Richard Rorex is running unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the only Senate seat up for grabs, Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-Gardena), whose 
Sacramento career stretches back to the 1930s, could face a strong challenge 
from Torrance Councilman George Nakano in the redrawn 28th District. JoAnne 
Rodda and Mike Sidley also are running for the Democratic nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakano, who said he plans to spend more than $200,000 on the race, said that 
Dills has been in office far too long.  
</P>
<P>
 "He'll be 84 this year," Nakano said. "I don't think he has had this type of a 
challenge. He has had it fairly easy in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Dills, however, said age is not an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a question of whether you can win a footrace or how many pounds you 
can push up -- it's how well you represent the people in your district," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 The winner will face Republican David Barrett Cohen, the sole candidate in his 
party's primary. Also running are Libertarian Arvid Donner and Peace and 
Freedom candidate Cindy Henderson. South Bay Legislative Races

ZAPPING OIL SPILLS WITH DRY ICE AND INGENUITY; INVENTIONS: TIM BECK SAYS HE'S 
DISCOVERED A WAY TO FREEZE OIL AND SIMPLIFY THE CLEANUP EFFORT. AND THE 
TECHNIQUE COULD BE USED TO FIGHT FIRES AS WELL. SKEPTICS ARE A LITTLE COOL TO 
THE IDEA. 
</P>

<P>
 It all started with the Huntington Beach oil spill in 1990, when Tim Beck 
stood on the beach watching a black tide of crude oil heading into shore. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just kept getting closer and closer (to the beach)), and nobody showed up 
to save the day," says Beck, 45, a Manhattan Beach inventor and, to make ends 
meet, an El Segundo substitute science teacher. "I started thinking there had 
to be some way to stop an oil spill." 
</P>
<P>
 Then it came to him. Why not use massive heat extraction? In other words, why 
not freeze the oil? Turn the liquid oil spill into a frozen oil spill -- an 
"oilberg" as Beck calls it. Then you could simply pluck the chunks of oil right 
off the water, simple as fishing an ice cube out of a highball. 
</P>
<P>
 It was simple, it was ingenious -- and it took Beck three years to figure out 
how to do it. Now, he says, the concept is proven.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, as with any invention, Beck says, there are doubters, naysayers, 
flat-worlders. But we'll get to that later. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of freezing oil came almost naturally to Beck, who has freezing 
experience. For 12 years Beck, who has a master's degree in biology from UCLA, 
ran a kidney bank at which the organs were preserved by supercooling 
techniques. Beck's first idea for freezing oil spills was to use liquid 
nitrogen, which at nearly minus 300 degrees Fahrenheit is plenty cold enough to 
freeze oil or almost anything else. Only problem was, it's so cold that it 
might also freeze the oil-spill workers along with the oil. He had to scratch 
that idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Beck thought about using frozen carbon dioxide -- that is, dry ice -- as 
the heat extraction agent. The only problem was that oil experts said dry ice, 
at minus 109 degrees Fahrenheit, isn't cold enough to freeze crude oil. Beck 
discovered that it was indeed cold enough, once the gases contained in crude 
oil dissipated into the air. * 
</P>
<P>
 The problem then was figuring out how to put dry ice on an oil spill. You 
couldn't just dump blocks of dry ice in the oil-covered water, because dry ice 
doesn't float.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally Beck found a company in Rancho Cucamonga, Alpheus Cleaning 
Technologies, that manufactures dry ice pellets for "ice blasting," which is 
like sandblasting except that dry ice is used. For about 15 cents a pound, the 
company sells dry ice pellets about an eighth of an inch long and about the 
thickness of spaghetti -- small enough to float, big enough to freeze oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Beck started taking his idea to oil companies, seeking financing to continue 
the experiments. But he had a hard time finding backers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oil companies don't like to focus on oil spills," he says. "Instead of 
funding research, they'd rather say, 'What problem?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, though, Beck says he found an oil company that put about $50,000 
into his research program. (Beck says a secrecy agreement prevents him from 
identifying the company.) He put another $20,000 of his own money into it. 
</P>
<P>
 The results were encouraging, Beck says. During one experiment he managed to 
create a 500-pound "oilberg," demonstrating the feasibility of the process on 
bigger-than-a-mudpuddle spills. 
</P>
<P>
 He also managed to come up with another application for his dry-ice theories: 
firefighting. Beck figured that shooting dry ice pellets into an enclosed room 
would quickly "supercool" the temperature, thus quashing the fire. And since 
dry ice evaporates into a gas, rather than melting into water, it would prevent 
water damage in library fires, museum fires -- any fires where water is almost 
as dangerous as the fire itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month Beck and Pat Smith, his partner in the project, staged a 
demonstration of both dry ice applications -- oil freezing and firefighting -- 
at the Manhattan Beach Fire Department. While firefighters and an oil spill 
specialist for Chevron looked on, Beck used a converted leaf-blower -- he calls 
it a cryoblaster -- to shoot dry ice pellets onto a tub full of oil. Then he 
used a converted fire extinguisher to shoot dry ice pellets onto a fire in a 
can. The results? The oil froze, and the fire went out. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Beck's former UCLA professors, who was there to lend moral support, was 
encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it has real possibilities," said chemistry professor Mario Baur. 
"This is so much better (for oil spill cleanup) than anything we have so far. 
It has a lot of potential in certain situations." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone was completely convinced, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying anything bad about the idea," Stu Hackney, an oil spill 
coordinator for Chevron in El Segundo, said later. "It might work in calm 
water, around piers and that kind of thing." But Hackney doubts it would be 
practical in open water, where wave action could disperse frozen oil just as it 
does unfrozen oil. 
</P>
<P>
 As for fighting fires with dry ice, Manhattan Beach Fire Marshal Steven Age 
predicted, "It's going to take a little more work." 
</P>
<P>
 But Beck is undeterred. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we need now is corporate support and financing," he says. "Our only 
problem is money." 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't want the money for himself, he says, but for the research. In fact, 
he hasn't even patented the dry-ice process. 
</P>
<P>
 "All patents do is give you the right to sue people," Beck says. "We're 
looking for ways to protect the environment." Besides, he adds with a laugh, 
"We inventors always die poor." 
</P>
<P>
 So who knows? Maybe someday Tim Beck will be to oil spills what Thomas Edison 
was to the kerosene lamp -- the guy who will put them out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 And even if that doesn't work out, he has other ideas. Right now, for example, 
he has an idea for taming hurricanes by cooling down the sea water they move 
over. See, first you dump a bunch of dry ice into the water from submarines . .

2 MAJOR HOSPITALS PLAN TO JOIN FORCES; HEALTH CARE: QUEEN OF THE VALLEY AND 
INTER-COMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTER WILL BECOME 'CITRUS VALLEY HEALTH PARTNERS.' 
THEY WILL SHARE MANAGERS, STAFFS AND SERVICES INSTEAD OF COMPETING FOR 
PATIENTS.

<P>
 A proposed merger between former rivals -- West Covina's Queen of the Valley 
Hospital and Covina's Inter-Community Medical Center -- will create the 
second-largest health care provider in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The two hospitals are scheduled to merge as a new nonprofit entity on April 
29, under the name "Citrus Valley Health Partners," according to an agreement 
signed last week. The consolidation agreement is subject to approval by state 
and federal agencies and the filing of routine legal agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 Citrus Valley Health Partners will provide a total of 532 beds; by comparison, 
Pasadena's Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena -- the valley's largest -- 
has 606 beds and Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center has 449. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger means that each hospital will share managers, staffs and services 
instead of competing for patients, said Maureen L. O'Connor, president and 
chief executive officer of Inter-Community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the community benefits, knowing that the boards of directors are so 
committed to having quality service in place that they're willing to set aside 
their differences and work together on a plan that will keep us both secure in 
the future," said O'Connor, who will become executive vice president of the 
merged organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The two hospitals, which are 4 1/2 miles apart, will keep their current 
medical centers. But Queen of the Valley, which was founded as a nonprofit 
Catholic hospital, will continue its policy of not providing abortions or 
vasectomies, officials said. And Inter-Community will continue to provide those 
services as well as chaplains of different faiths, O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
 No layoffs are expected immediately, although staffing will be reviewed as the 
merger gets under way, said Peter E. Makowski, president and chief executive 
officer of Queen of the Valley. Makowski, who will become chief executive 
officer of the merged organization, said any staff cutbacks would involve 
departments outside patient care, such as the business office. In the long run, 
Makowski said, employees at both hospitals will have more job security under 
the new organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't do this, if we continue our independent paths, both organizations 
are going to suffer as a result," he said. "I'd say employment is more 
threatened by doing (nothing)." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the merger, patients at each hospital will be able to keep their own 
doctors but may be routed to the other medical centers for some services. 
Managers are working on consolidating services and eliminating some 
duplication, although each center will provide basic acute care, O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in some cases, one hospital will offer services that the other doesn't. 
Queen of the Valley, for instance, provides an acute physical rehabilitation 
program while Inter-Community has an open-heart surgery program. Currently, 
about 80% of each hospital's doctors are also on staff at the other hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past few years, the competitive health care arena has prompted each 
hospital to consider merger possibilities, officials said. In December, boards 
at each hospital began serious discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite clear that free-standing hospitals are going to be at a 
disadvantage with whatever kind of overarching system that health care reform 
takes," O'Connor said. "Currently, free-standing hospitals are having a 
difficult time in some areas, keeping up with all the changes that HMOs bring 
down the pike." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they do not know yet whether fees or service charges will 
change. The Deal

Covina and Inter-Community Medical Center in Covina -- plan to merge April 29

BARRIERS STEM TIDE OF MUD; ENVIRONMENT: CREWS WORKED AROUND-THE-CLOCK TO 
INSTALL FLOOD-CONTROL MEASURES IN PASADENA GLEN. BUT OFFICIALS WARN THAT HEAVY 
RAINS COULD POSE MAJOR PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hastily erected flood-control measures kept back mudflows in the Pasadena Glen 
during last week's rains. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to prevent mudflows such as the one that clogged the Glen on Feb. 
7, the U.S. Soil Conservation Service installed debris barriers along the 
channel, built a second trash rack at the top of the glen to catch large 
objects including logs and boulders, and is continuing work on a concrete-lined 
channel down Winifred Canyon, an adjoining canyon that flows into the glen. 
</P>
<P>
 In a race to beat the rains, crews worked around the clock for five days on 
the highest-priority projects, said Bob Dean, district manager of the Soil 
Conservation Service. 
</P>
<P>
 These included five of the seven debris barriers -- metal pipes bolted to 
planks of wood that hold back mud and debris -- and a second trash rack, a 
50-foot-wide row of 8-inch metal pipes set several feet apart to catch the 
largest rocks and logs. 
</P>
<P>
 The existing trash rack, which was filled with boulders that bent its bars 
during the previous storm, was cleared and repaired. Crews resumed work on the 
Winifred Canyon channel, which had been undermined by tumbling debris. 
</P>
<P>
 John O'Neill, construction supervisor for the projects, said that although 
intermittent rains had slowed the work, the Winifred channel would be completed 
by the end of this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews also dredged the channel along the glen, which filled with muck during 
the last mudflow. Dean said this allowed water and debris to flow smoothly to 
the bottom instead of backing up during the past week's rains. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainfall to the Glen totaled three inches over the past two weeks, Dean said 
-- probably not enough to cause a mudflow like the one two weeks ago. But worse 
could come in heavier rains, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Compared to the mudflow that's going to come out of there I don't think we've 
seen a mudflow (yet)," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Dean said he hopes the new flood-control measures, which together cost between 
$250,000 and $300,000, will withstand a four- to five-inch rainfall. That 
depends on the intensity of the downpour, he said. For instance, seven inches 
of rainfall in a week would not be a problem, but that amount in a day could be 
disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel a lot more secure, and it seems every week or so we keep getting 
closer and closer to having a more stable environment here," Glen resident Brad 
Dickason said.

CARSON COUNCIL REFUSES TO ALTER ARCADE ORDINANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bars, restaurants, theaters and arcades will continue to be the only 
businesses permitted to operate video games, despite a petition requesting a 
change in the arcade ordinance that was submitted to the Carson City Council by 
several hundred residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted 4 to 1 last week not to change its restrictions on 
video games.Councilwoman Lorelie S. Olaes dissented. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance went into effect in 1984 after businesses and neighbors raised 
concerns about loitering. 
</P>
<P>
 The petition had backed a proposal by two businesses, Big Kid Enterprises and 
HomeRun Cards and Comics, requesting permission to operate three or fewer video 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 The municipal code requires that any business with more than three games pay 
$1,500 for a conditional use permit to operate as an arcade. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Iannitti of HomeRun and Dennis Trentadue of Big Kid said in a letter to 
the council that they should be allowed to have video games because children 
should not be hanging out in bars, restaurants or theaters, and that their 
businesses could provide "certain redeeming qualities" that would "be a 
positive input for children." 
</P>
<P>
 The maximum penalty for violation of the ordinance is a $500 fine and six 
months in prison. MARY GUTHRIE

CONTROL OF FEDERAL JOB FUNDS SHIFTED; FINANCES: ALLEGATIONS OF MISSPENT MONEY 
AT EL MONTE SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCY PROMPT COUNTY SUPERVISORS TO TEMPORARILY STOP 
ADMINISTRATOR FROM HANDLING DISBURSEMENT OF EMPLOYMENT-TRAINING DOLLARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Prompted in part by an ongoing investigation into alleged misspent funds at an 
El Monte social service agency, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on 
Tuesday temporarily took away control of $50 million in job-training funds from 
a county executive and requested a report on which department should 
permanently oversee allocation of the employment-training money. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors have stopped Stephanie Klopfleisch, chief deputy director of 
the Department of Community and Senior Citizen Services, from handling 
administration of the federal funds.Instead, disbursement of the government 
money will be overseen by Jose Martinez, a county employee who is executive 
director of the nonprofit Private Industry Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Formerly, the two shared administrative duties, because, under federal rules, 
the council serves as an advisory partner to the county in disbursing the 
federal job-training funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's chief administrative officer will advise the board in 30 days on 
whether another county department, such as Community Development, should handle 
the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by the board Tuesday was a compromise reached at the last minute 
to avoid more wrangling between the department and the Private Industry 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The council initially requested an audit of the county agency after it was 
alleged that the Mid-Valley Manpower Training Consortium in El Monte showed 
illegal expenditures and that $600,000 was missing. Mid-Valley's director, 
Douglas Shaw, was fired and is under criminal investigation by federal Labor 
Department agents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mid-Valley investigation came at a time when the Department of Community 
and Senior Citizen Services was also reporting a 160% increase in 
administrative costs without a corresponding increase in the number of people 
receiving job training. In addition, the department last year lost $1 million 
in federal job training money after the funds went unused and had to be 
returned.

HAWTHORNE COUNCIL TO FIRE CITY ATTORNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SANDELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hawthorne City Atty. Michael Adamson has been notified that the City Council 
intends to fire him next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 1 Monday to notify Adamson of its intent to dismiss him 
at a public meeting March 25. Councilman Steven Andersen cast the dissenting 
vote, saying Adamson had "done a good job for the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members declined to say why Adamson, a 17-year veteran of the city 
attorney's office, was placed on paid leave and given 30 days notice of his 
dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to say anything that will jeopardize the process," Mayor Larry 
Guidi said. Councilwoman Martha Bails said only that the council thought a 
change needed to be made.  
</P>
<P>
 The council named Assistant City Atty. Glen Shishido as acting city attorney.  
</P>
<P>
 Adamson, 48, said the council was motivated by his investigation of 
Councilwoman Ginny M. Lambert during her failed run for mayor in 1991.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is just a political vendetta," Adamson said Monday. "They don't feel 
they need any grounds to fire me. They just said they had lost trust and 
confidence in me." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lambert and other council members said their action was not politically 
motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not sour grapes," Lambert said.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Adamson examined allegations by former Councilman David M. York that 
Lambert had violated state laws by privately lobbying the Planning Commission 
to postpone a vote on a condominium project. Lambert lost the mayoral race to 
current Councilman Steve Andersen by 34 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, Lambert said Adamson's probe conflicted with his obligation to 
represent her as a member of the City Council. She said the investigation was 
intended to undermine her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office reviewed the 
dispute and found insufficient evidence to charge either Lambert or Adamson 
with a crime. In addition, the State Bar of California said Adamson did not 
violate any ethical standards in launching the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Adamson, who was hired in 1977 as an assistant city attorney and was promoted 
to city attorney in 1981, has 30 days to respond to the notice that the council 
intends to fire him. He said Tuesday he has not decided whether to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also voted to remove a provision in its employment contracts with 
Adamson and City Manager James H. Mitsch. The contracts allowed the two 
officials to be paid for a percentage of their unused sick leave and vacation 
time.  
</P>
<P>
 Andersen abstained on the Adamson vote and was not present for the Mitsch 
vote.

COMMUNITY NEWS; TERMINAL ISLAND; CITY SETTLES LAWSUIT OVER COAL STORAGE YARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long Beach has agreed to drop its lawsuit against the Los Angeles Harbor 
Department, clearing the way for a proposed 120-acre storage yard for coal, 
petroleum coke and other coal byproducts on Terminal Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement, the Port of Los Angeles will regularly monitor the 
emissions and report its findings to the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's lawsuit had alleged that dust from the new yard would threaten the 
health of Long Beach residents. The case was scheduled for trial March 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Alan S. Lowenthal, who led Long Beach's challenge, said the AQMD 
will detect and solve any problems before they affect residents. Long Beach 
officials said dust-control measures, such as keeping the piles moist, will 
prevent health hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed $180-million yard eventually will store up to 20 million tons of 
coal and petroleum coke and allow the Los Angeles terminal to dominate the 
coal-export market. It is expected to be completed by 1996 and to bring about 
5,900 jobs to the region.

COMMUNITY NEWS; GARDENA; ASIAN CENTER GETS $50,000 TO HELP STROKE VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Area residents who have had strokes will be able to receive free therapy, 
counseling and field trips at the Asian Community Service Center, now that the 
center has received a $50,000 grant to expand its support program. 
</P>
<P>
 The center at 14112 S. Kingsley Drive helped initiate a support group for 
stroke patients 10 years ago.A group of 17 people who have suffered strokes has 
gathered periodically at the center to talk and play "gateball," a Japanese 
form of croquet, said center Director Betty Masai. Volunteers also have 
provided occasional physical or speech therapy sessions for group members. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, with the Community Development Block Grant from the city of Gardena, 
the center will hire a coordinator to expand and oversee the program. Program 
organizers hope to contract with physical, occupational and speech therapists 
to provide free therapy sessions on a more regular basis and to organize field 
trips and transportation to help members socialize and get around more easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporting stroke victims and helping them feel part of the community are key 
goals. "This group is isolated and depressed," said Masai. "They don't like to 
eat in restaurants because they can't chew, have slow movements and feel people 
are looking at them." 
</P>
<P>
 The expanded program will include educational seminars and counseling sessions 
for families and an outreach effort to draw more people into the program. 
Organizers hope to serve up to 25 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant will fund the program for three years, Masai said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Asian Community Service Center is a county facility that provides a 
variety of bilingual social services to area residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The center needs professional therapists to work with the stroke patients on 
weekday mornings, particularly Mondays, between 10 and 11 a.m. They will be 
paid a small stipend. Information: (310) 217-7300. IRIS YOKOI

TOPICS / EDUCATION; THESE STUDENTS GET A DOSE OF ADULTHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<P>
 Piano music sounded as the brides-in-training, all 55 of them, marched down 
the aisle clad in white lace and satin, arm in arm with their bridegrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 In unison the couples repeated the vow: "I take thee to be my hypothetical 
wife/husband through thick and through thin, in time of plenty and in time of 
want, till June do us part." 
</P>
<P>
 "You may now hug the bride," the minister, Mountain View High School Principal 
Gloria Acosta-Arau, announced. "(Your) honeymoon: You have no homework 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday, 110 students from the El Monte school's elective course "On 
Your Own" symbolically tied the knot. Designed to prepare them for the 
day-to-day realities of adult life, the course simulates the realities of 
marriage and parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
 In the six months before the ceremony, students date, plan a budget, find a 
job, rent an apartment, file taxes and prepare for their wedding together. 
</P>
<P>
 "When kids graduate from the class, it makes them aware there's a lot more to 
marriage than just falling in love," said teacher Priscilla Robinson, who 
started the class 17 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Shivering outside the cafeteria in sleeveless dresses, girls waited nervously 
for the wedding to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to share everything with someone else," Alma Gonzalez, 17, said 
apprehensively. "You have to budget, to be responsible and pay your bills." 
</P>
<P>
 The boys, natty in their suits, huddled together with the energy of a football 
team before the big game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows you that life after high school isn't that easy," Patrick Macias, 
18, said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first semester, boys and girls got to know each other and listed their 
preferred partners. Robinson matched the 55 couples and paired the remaining 20 
girls as roommates. 
</P>
<P>
 Before marrying, each student was required to develop a professional cover 
letter and resume, and find a job through a series of mock interviews with 
local employers (real ones). Depending on their salaries, the students worked 
out budgets with their partners, paid bills for a month and then balanced a 
checkbook. 
</P>
<P>
 On a field trip to apartment buildings, they learned about rental 
applications, credit checks and evictions, then searched want ads for an 
apartment that met their needs and budget. 
</P>
<P>
 After the wedding, they study nutrition, plan a balanced menu, then simulate a 
shopping trip, where they add up the cost of groceries they need and adjust 
their budget, if necessary, to pay for them. They learn about credit, simulate 
buying a car, and taking out an insurance policy.  
</P>
<P>
 In the last month of the class, they have a baby: a five-pound flour sack they 
must care for 24 hours a day for four weeks, including waking up at 1 a.m. and 
5 a.m. to tend it. 
</P>
<P>
 Liz Flores said that after taking the class she's more likely to wait before 
facing the altar for real.

COMMUNITY NEWS; CENTER FOR CIVIC WORKERS' CHILDREN OPENS

<P>
 Because both of them work at Torrance City Hall, Judy Emerson and her husband, 
Alan, worried that their three children might be stranded miles away at day 
care near their home in Lomita if an earthquake struck. 
</P>
<P>
 So 1 1/2 years ago they moved to Torrance so the family would all be in the 
same city during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month they brought their family even closer by enrolling the children in 
a new city-sponsored day-care program that gives priority to city employees. 
Although other large employers contract for day care, Torrance is the first 
South Bay city to sponsor a child-care facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 3 1/2-year-old twins Autumn and Shane spend their days only blocks from 
City Hall. And 6-year-old Jade goes to school just up the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The city spent $250,000 to turn part of a boarded-up elementary school into a 
day-care center for 82 children 6 weeks to 5 years old, said Leyta Fuentes, a 
city employee who served on the Torrance Child Care Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 31, City Kids, operated by Children's Discovery Center, opened at 1520 
Greenwood St., the former site of the Greenwood School. The center has 29 
children, all but three with parents or guardians who work at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved the center on the condition that it support itself 
through fees after the start-up costs, Councilman Mark Wirth said. The school 
will rely on the city for basic upkeep, such as plumbing and lawn care. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first few months, the school does not expect to turn a profit, said 
Angela Dorrell, regional director for Children's Discovery Center. The rest of 
the slots probably will be filled by September, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center charges $122 a week for infants; $102 for children 18 months to 36 
months, and $82 for children 36 months to 5 years, which Emerson said is less 
expensive than what she used to pay for the twins in home care. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a $150,000 grant from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, 
first priority for spaces in the school goes to people who car-pool. Second 
priority goes to employees of the city, followed by people who live or work in 
Torrance.  
</P>
<P>
 Besides peace of mind for employees, having children in a city-sponsored 
center may bring additional benefits. "I expect we will be giving them artwork 
to hang up in the Civic Center and be over at City Hall singing Christmas 
carols," Dorrell said.

COMMUNITY NEWS; THE PENINSULA; LIBRARIES STRUGGLING TO OVERCOME DEFICIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Palos Verdes Library District is struggling to maintain regular operations 
despite an $896,000 drop in revenue this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The cutback, caused by 1992 state changes affecting local property taxes, has 
had a devastating effect on the peninsula's three libraries, spokeswoman Nancy 
Mahr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Full- and part-time staff have been reduced from 92 to 61, and public hours at 
the three libraries have declined from 125 to 80 hours per week. Spending on 
materials has been cut $125,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The library district budget has lost $1.4 million over the past two years, 
Mahr said. 
</P>
<P>
 The independent special district gets no money from the city, Mahr said. "In a 
place like Torrance, (the library) can fall back on the city. The city can 
choose to make up the money." 
</P>
<P>
 The Local Area Formation Commission, which oversees special districts, is 
looking into future funding for special districts, Mahr said.  
</P>
<P>
 "As a small special district, we are very concerned over which direction they 
will take. If, for example, we were consolidated with the L.A. County system, 
(we) wouldn't be able to tailor materials purchases and services to this 
community's needs," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district system was devised in 1928 to meet the needs of people living on 
the Palos Verdes Peninsula, Mahr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 57,000 people (10% from other South Bay cities) among a population of 
67,500 have library cards. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the community was rallying to support the libraries with fund raising 
and volunteer help. SUSAN WOODWARD

<P>
 Los Angeles International Airport last week introduced the first of four 
electric shuttle buses for the regular route between remote parking lots and 
the main terminal. 
</P>
<P>
 The battery-powered buses emit 97% less pollution than diesel-powered vehicles 
and can carry 25 seated and seven standing passengers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Use of the one bus will eliminate more than 5,000 pounds of smog-forming 
emissions from the atmosphere this year, Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth 
Galanter said. Three buses are scheduled to be added later this year. SUSAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 A recreation program designed to help keep Catalina Island teen-agers out of 
trouble is being planned for Avalon's Tremont Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Catalina Company recently offered to let the city of Avalon use the 
building at no charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has applied for a $40,000 grant from the Los Angeles County 
Regional Park District to renovate the hall and establish the program for 
at-risk youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there are few recreational activities in Avalon, nearly all of the 
island's 700 youths are "at risk," said Anni Marshall, community services 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers "will get into drugs and alcohol because there's not much to do," 
said Councilwoman Barbara J. Doutt. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will offer such classes as self-defense, ballet and acting. SUSAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 A lieutenant who heads the child-abuse unit of the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department will become police chief of one of the safest cities in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Joseph R. Surgent, 51, was named by the city administrator Tuesday to take 
the reins of the 20-person Police Department March 14.Surgent was chosen from a 
field of nearly 30 candidates to fill the $58,704 position. The salary is the 
lowest for a chief in the valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Clem L. Bartolai said Surgent will take a pay cut but will get a pension 
from the Sheriff's Department because he is retiring after 20 years' service. 
</P>
<P>
 Surgent has a master's degree in administration from Cal State Los Angeles and 
is married with three grown children. He succeeds Chief I. E. (Bill) Betts, who 
retired in August after 17 years. Last year state crime statistics ranked 
Sierra Madre 21st among cities with the least crime in the state.

CRIME: TEACHER IS VICTIMIZED TWICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Feb. 10 at 9:50 a.m., Washington Middle School teacher Pamela Altea 
cautioned two adults to leave the area adjacent to the Pasadena school. With a 
group of students watching, the adults viciously attacked Altea and beat her to 
a state of near senselessness. 
</P>
<P>
 It appears that school board President George Van Alstine, Supt. Vera Vignes, 
district Police Chief Jarado J. Blue, Principal Karen Kommer and United 
Teachers of Pasadena President Frank Scoonover all agree that the beating was 
the teacher's fault because she did not lock a gate. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems Pamela Altea is not only a victim of a criminal beating but of a 
school system that is managed by a bureaucracy that is more interested in job 
security and the next promotion than in meeting the education needs of the 
community.

EFFORT

<P>
 The city is waiving fees on inspections or repairs to earthquake-damaged 
buildings and offering damaged businesses a penalty-free extension on paying 
the business tax. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's earthquake relief program also waives for 30 days a city tax on 
hotel rooms for people who work in West Hollywood and were displaced from their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspection and building fees were waived for quake-affected businesses that 
wish to relocate to West Hollywood. The relief plan will be in place until May 
17. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake damage in West Hollywood was minimal, with only a handful of 
buildings deemed unsafe.

COVER STORY; REAL ESTATE GETS A REALITY CHECK; AS HOME PRICES CONTINUE THEIR 
DOWNWARD SPIRAL, BUYERS ARE HAVING THE LAST LAUGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENEE TAWA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Funny, how the real estate tables have turned. 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly five years after the days of home-sale madness, the sweet deals are 
still flying -- but this time with a buyer's vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the story of how the Hesters snared their dream home in Sierra Madre, 
how Charlotte Kramer bought her first house in Claremont, how desperate seller 
Ruben Corral concocted a "buy-my-house, get-my-car-free" scheme in Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in '88 and '89, giddy sellers told the war stories about quick-and-dirty 
sales, multiple offers and bidding wars that tacked on as much as $100,000 to 
their asking price. Now, in a stunning reversal of fortune, the buyers are 
having their time in the sun, said Eileen Maloney, a broker associate at Curtis 
Real Estate in Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like Mr. Toad's wild ride," she marveled. 
</P>
<P>
 For 15 years in Southern California, a house wasn't so much your castle as it 
was money in the bank. But that was before the recession-battered market took a 
spectacular dive. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one really considered the fact that the economy might fall out from under 
them," said Bob Fry, broker-owner of Equity Plus Properties in Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Home prices and sales are still dropping in the San Gabriel Valley, according 
to figures from Dataquick Informations Systems, which analyzes government 
records of completed transactions. From October to December, 1993, compared to 
the same period in 1992, the median sales price dropped in 20 of 27 cities; the 
biggest slide was 24.1%, in San Marino. Among valley cities, the average sales 
price was $219,111, down 5% from the previous year and down 9% from 1990, when 
the market was booming. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, in the last three months of 1993, the number of home sales fell by 5% 
valleywide in 1993 below an already snail-paced 1992, from 3,257 to 3,089; 
Monterey Park was the slowest market, with home sales down by about 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The result, agents say, has been a new wave of hope for first-time buyers to 
get a foothold in real estate. The market also has created a new class of 
losers: once house-rich homeowners who find their equity dwindling every month 
that the for-sale sign stays up on the front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Maloney tells of a young couple who sold their condominium to buy a house. The 
couple paid $425,000 for a Claremont house in the red-hot market days of '89, 
even though it was appraised at $275,000. They added $60,000 worth of 
improvements, including landscaping and hardwood floors. Recently, they decided 
to move back to New York and hurriedly sold at $325,000, a $160,000 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Some real estate agents say it's not unusual for a reasonably priced house to 
stay on the market for six months or more. Others warn buyers not to wait for 
another market crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've really bottomed out here," said Glendora real estate agent Marty 
Rodriguez, the No. 1 agent in Century 21's 90,000-member network. "We see the 
market as being very well picked over." 
</P>
<P>
 These are the stories, a look at the market's vagaries through the eyes of 
residents whose lives changed as a result: The First-Time Buyer 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte Kramer grew tired of tiptoeing around her Claremont apartment at 
2:30 a.m. so she wouldn't wake the neighbors when she got home from her job as 
a 911 emergency supervisor for Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the 33-year-old single woman started socking away money to buy 
a house. But Kramer, who makes $42,000 a year, aimed low. Someday, she thought, 
she could afford a little house in, say, Fontana and brave the killer commute 
to work in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was putting it into a fantasy fund," admitted Kramer, in her 
high-spirited, fast-talking way. 
</P>
<P>
 Until her real estate agent, Eileen Maloney, called and said there was a 
1,300-square-foot bungalow in Claremont that she had to see. Immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 The location was perfect -- a five-minute drive from Pitzer College, where 
Kramer is a full-time student, and a 25-minute drive from work. 
</P>
<P>
 The house, which listed at $208,000 a year before, had dropped to $155,000 in 
the seller's haste to move. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew at the curb that I wanted this house," said Kramer, who started the 
paperwork that afternoon to make it hers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer walked into the three-bedroom house and instantly pictured where her 
furniture would go -- her china cabinet here, her entertainment center there, 
her panda picture in the kitchen. The back yard took her breath away, with a 
redwood hot tub, a droopy Chinese elm and other trees, one of which later 
became the perfect place for a hammock. The two-car garage struck her as a safe 
place to park when she got home late at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer's parents gave her $4,000 to help with the $11,000 move-in cost, which 
included down payment and closing fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer's monthly mortgage payment on the three-bedroom, three-bathroom house 
is $1,100; her monthly rent for her two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment was 
$750. Her deal was not just beginner's luck. According to the California Assn. 
of Realtors, more than half the home-buyers in 1993 were first-timers. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1993, Kramer moved into what a friend dubbed her "Hansel and Gretel 
cottage" because of the house's charm. She had the carpets cleaned and did a 
little touch-up painting. One day, when she was painting, a stray dog wandered 
in and never left. Kramer, who had wanted a dog, took Honey's arrival as a sign 
that she was in the right place. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Honey, a pit bull-golden retriever mix, lives in the back yard with visiting 
blue jays, hummingbirds and woodpeckers that dive for the peanuts that Kramer 
leaves out. Honey is a big hit with the neighborhood kids, and so is Kramer, 
who reads them stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Christmas, for the first time, Kramer bought a tree so tall that its tip 
tickled the living room ceiling. She went crazy with lights and ornaments, and 
topped the tree with a porcelain angel in a red skirt. After grizzly 
murder-and-mayhem shifts at work, she liked to lie on her couch and watch the 
tree's blinking lights. 
</P>
<P>
 At last, she thought. Peace.

 The house: A 1,300-square-foot Claremont bungalow. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal: The bungalow's owner, in a hurry to sell, dropped the price from 
$208,000 to $155,000. Kramer's real estate agent took her to see it the day the 
price dropped -- and Kramer quickly made an offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The extras: Kramer's mortgage payment is only about $300 more than her 
apartment rent was, and that's before taxes. The house includes a redwood hot 
tub, track lights and a skylight. The Desperate Seller 
</P>
<P>
 Ruben Corral braced himself for another gut shot. 
</P>
<P>
 He bit the bullet each time he dropped the price on his wood-frame Altadena 
bungalow, which he bought as an investment last April after he was 
</P>
<P>
 laid off from his job as a Lockheed engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 In less than a year, his $149,500 asking price has sunk to $125,000. But since 
September, no one has even bothered to look at the two-bedroom, one-bathroom 
house. Corral, 44, who lives in another Altadena house with his wife and 
10-year-old son, is making $400 monthly mortgage payments on an empty bungalow. 
His own house payments are $1,189 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a hefty burden on a combined monthly income of less than $4,000. Corral 
now manages rental properties, and his wife is a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, Corral's real estate agent, Norman Merino, bought him a beer 
and sat him down for a little talk. Corral steeled himself, thinking he would 
have to drop his price past the point of no return -- he bought the house for 
$75,000 and added $30,000 in improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 But Merino had another idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's throw in your car," Merino said. "That'll bring people in." 
</P>
<P>
 Corral thought for a minute. He loved his 1988 Acura Legend -- a four-door 
automatic -- but had two other cars. So why not? In fact, at Merino's 
suggestion, Corral decided to sweeten the pot even more. He agreed to pop for a 
trip to Hawaii for the agent who sells his house. 
</P>
<P>
 The car is worth about $5,000, a trip to Hawaii runs about $800. The whole 
package meant that Corral would break even or possibly walk away with about 
$10,000, if he gets his asking price. He had hoped to make $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Corral is a good-natured man who recounts his misfortune without a trace of 
bitterness. So far, about 20 people have called about the deal, and two have 
asked to see the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll try anything," Corral said, laughing. "I'll even have a clown out here 
one day . . . you know, like those chicken place (promotions)?" 
</P>
<P>
 What hurts most is that no one saw the same charm in the house that he did. 
</P>
<P>
 When Corral first saw the 1920s-era house, he looked beyond the rotting wood 
floors, ceiling cracks and peeling paint. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thought it was a cute little house," he said. "It was a mess, but with 
a little TLC . . . it'd be perfect for a young family just starting out." 
</P>
<P>
 Corral made all the improvements and renovations himself, except for the 
electrical work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put a lot of my heart in here," he said, arms folded. 
</P>

 The Desperate Seller 
</P>
<P>
 Name: Ruben Corral. 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 44. 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: Laid-off Lockheed engineer who manages rental properties. 
</P>
<P>
 The house: A 790-square-foot Altadena bungalow. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal: Two-bedroom, one-bath house for $125,000 includes $30,000 in 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The extras: Corral will throw into the deal his 1988 Acura Legend; the buyers' 
agent gets a trip to Hawaii. The Dream House 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara and Jim Hester pined for the old Delgatto place, the corner house with 
bougainvillea vines, prickly pear cactus plants and apple trees. It was a 
looker of a house, named after its onetime owners, a prominent Sierra Madre 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 For six years, Barbara Hester thought wistfully about the 1927 Spanish-style 
house, just a mile away from her own in Sierra Madre. The Hesters weren't 
really planning to move, although they talked about looking for a place with 
more space. 
</P>
<P>
 In late 1992, on the way back from a nearby open house, the Hesters spotted a 
for-sale sign on the Delgatto place. That same day, they called their real 
estate agent, Judy Webb-Martin, and said: Get us into this place. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Hester, 50, fell in love with the east-facing breakfast nook that 
catches the morning sun. Jim Hester, a 48-year-old attorney and city planning 
commissioner, had his eye on the 500-slot basement wine cellar. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the house I had been looking for all my life," recalled Barbara 
Hester, an insurance administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 But the four-bedroom house was a pricey temptress; the $794,000 listing was 
enough to make even the smitten Hesters shy away. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the housing market took another tumble early last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The price sank to $699,000. In March, 1993, the Hesters offered $650,000, but 
were turned down. 
</P>
<P>
 In summer, 1993, the sellers got antsy to move back to Texas and approached 
the Hesters. After sticky negotiations, the sellers settled on $580,000, 27% 
less than their original asking price. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Hesters had hoped to get $490,000 for their own house but ended 
up getting about 22% less than they had wanted. But since they had bought 10 
years ago for $144,000, there was still enough equity for a down payment, 
closing costs and moving. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone ended up giving a little to make it work," Barbara Hester said on a 
recent evening before a roaring fire in her new house. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that (the market) is crazy," said Jim Hester. "It has become more 
sane. What was happening before, prices were absurd. . . . People were buying 
houses not to live in but for the investment. That was destroying 
neighborhoods. They would move as soon as they could turn a profit on it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hesters moved into the 3,100-square-foot house six months ago with their 
17-year-old son. Their two-story house plus basement includes original tile, 
glass and wood floors; bedroom verandas with French doors, and a stunning view 
that stretches to Long Beach on clear days. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Hester pulls into her driveway at night after work and marvels that 
the house is hers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dream House 
</P>
<P>
 Name: Jim and Barbara Hester. 
</P>
<P>
 Age: He is 48; she is 50. 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: He is an attorney; she's an insurance administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 The house: A 1927 Spanish-style house in Sierra Madre. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal: The Hesters, who had already been living in Sierra Madre, had eyed 
their dream house for years. Eventually, the price dropped, from $794,000 to 
$580,000. Ironically, their earlier $650,000 offer had been turned down. 
</P>
<P>
 The extras: 4,300 square feet, including dumb waiter, wine cellar and French 
doors that open up to bedroom verandas. San Gabriel Valley Home Sales

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: SOUTH BAY GETS A TASTE OF MOROCCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The diverse Lawndale dining scene, with restaurants featuring the foods of 
Persia, Cuba, Peru, Thailand and Vietnam as well as the more familiar Italian, 
Chinese, Japanese and Mexican establishments, has an exotic new addition -- the 
month-old Dar Salam, which offers the cuisine of Morocco.  
</P>
<P>
 Dar Salam, Arabic for "house of peace," is owned by Hassan Elfarissi, who 
immigrated to America in 1983 from Casablanca, Morocco. When his sister, Soud, 
arrived recently, they decided to open a restaurant. Like so many other 
restaurant owners, they have no formal training, but were blessed with having 
been raised by a mother who was a good cook. 
</P>
<P>
 At lunch, a popular choice is couscous with beef sirloin and a variety of 
vegetables ($6.75). For this dish, couscous, a grain-shaped steamed pasta that 
is a staple throughout North Africa, is mixed with raisins and onions. Another 
option is a brochette of beef ($6), served on a mound of rice. Another dish 
consists of a large plate of rice ($4.50) served with tuna, scrambled eggs and 
olives.  
</P>
<P>
 Most dinners begin with harira , a tomato-based vegetable soup garnished with 
oil-cured olives. The soup is usually followed with bestila , a sort of pie 
where phyllo dough encases layers of ground almonds, shredded chicken and eggs 
mixed with onions, all flavored with cinnamon, parsley and cilantro. This tasty 
dish is traditionally eaten with one's fingers.  
</P>
<P>
 Three multi-course dinners ($15) are offered, each named for a city in 
Morocco. The Fez features the harira soup, a spicy carrot salad or lentil 
salad, bestila , couscous with raisins and a leg of lamb with dried plums and 
sesame seeds. The Marrakesh is similar but the main course is leg of lamb with 
cinnamon, almonds and eggs. And what would a Moroccan menu be without a mention 
of Casablanca, which highlights a baked chicken with olives and lemons? 
</P>
<P>
 I bet that's what Humphrey Bogart would order. Here's cookin' at you, kid. 
</P>
<P>
 Dar Salam is at 14940 S. Prairie Ave., Lawndale. (310 ) 675-5850. Open seven 
days 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

TEENS / WHAT NOW?; STATE REGULATIONS FOR YOUTHS WHO WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm 14 and would really like to get a job after school so I don't have to 
always ask my mom for money for everything. Am I old enough to work in 
California?  
</P>
<P>
 The minimum age for working in California is 12, except in the entertainment 
industry, where you can work from birth. But working teen-agers are strictly 
regulated by the state, which wants to make sure that work doesn't interfere 
with school. With the exception of those seeking entertainment industry jobs, 
you'll need a work permit for any job you want. These permits are issued 
through your school and require the signature of your parent or guardian. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to obtain a job, you'll also need a Social Security number. 
</P>
<P>
 When school is in session, 12- and 13-year-olds are not allowed to work on 
school days. When school is not in session, they can work up to eight hours a 
day or 40 hours a week. They are only permitted to work between 7 a.m. and 7 
p.m., or to 9 p.m. during the summer months. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who are 14 or 15 may work eight hours a day up to 40 hours a week, but 
not during school hours, except in a school-supervised or school-administered 
work program. They also can't work before 7 a.m. or after 7 p.m. except in the 
summer when they may be employed until 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who are 16 or 17 are allowed to work up to four hours on a school day, 
eight hours on a non-school day and up to 48 hours a week. Work may not begin 
before 5 a.m. or continue past 10 p.m. on any day preceding a school day. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an exemption from these time requirements for any minor who is 
employed delivering newspapers to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no restrictions on jobs you get working in private homes: 
baby-sitting, lawn mowing, raking leaves, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 What Now? gets you reliable information from the experts about the law, money, 
schools, health and anything else you need explained. If you have a question

 GETTING HER KICKS 
</P>
<P>
 Peninsula High girls' soccer Coach Jim Alotis has an idea what makes Traci 
Arkenberg, the Panthers' high-scoring forward, the most prolific player in the 
South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter if it's practice or getting on a bus, she is competitive in 
everything," Alotis said. "That's why she is head and shoulders above everybody 
else. Everything has meaning to her. When she puts those shoes on and steps on 
the grass, she is an intensely focused person." 
</P>
<P>
 That intensity has helped the UCLA-bound Arkenberg and her teammates reach the 
Southern Section Division I quarterfinals. Third-seeded Peninsula (24-1-3) will 
play host to Royal of Simi Valley at 3 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkenberg, with two goals and three assists, had a hand in all of the 
Panthers' scoring Saturday in a 5-2, first-round victory over St. Lucy's of 
Glendora. The senior has 53 goals this season, the seventh-highest mark in 
Southern Section history, and 176 in her four-year varsity career, ranking 
fourth on the all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
 Those totals place Arkenberg alongside the two greatest girls' players in 
South Bay history -- Carin Jennings and Shannon Maddock. Jennings, who played 
for Palos Verdes from 1979-83, finished her prep career with 225 goals. 
Maddock, who played for Torrance from 1983-87, scored 191. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkenberg scored seven goals in a game this season against Hawthorne, but 
Peninsula is more than a one-player team. The defense, led by junior fullback 
Stephanie Ritter and goalkeeper Colleen Sharkey, has given up only 21 goals in 
28 games and has 10 shutouts. The team has scored 100 goals. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Panthers have done it against top-notch competition. They have played 
seven of the eight Division I quarterfinalists, with victories over South 
Torrance, Edison and Mater Dei, ties against Royal and second-seeded Claremont 
and their only loss against top-seeded Marina. 
</P>
<P>
 Alotis hopes Peninsula maintains better concentration today than it did Dec. 
7, when Royal scored on a corner kick on the game's final play to escape with a 
2-2 tie. Alotis said his players had thought the game was over before the 
last-second goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players heard (the official's) watch beeping, so one of our girls kicked 
the ball off the field," Alotis recalled. "So then the official gave (Royal) a 
corner kick. I think our kids were kind of miffed, but we learned a lesson from 
that one. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't over until the fat guy blows his whistle." STAYIN' ALIVE 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood, Redondo, Mira Costa and Mary Star all won second-round games 
Tuesday night to join Serra in the quarterfinals of the Southern Section boys' 
basketball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The five South Bay teams will play games at 7:30 Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-seeded Inglewood (25-3) meets Huntington Beach (19-9) in a Division 
II-AA game at Marina High in Huntington Beach after beating Compton, 70-45, 
Tuesday. Junior forward Paul Pierce had 22 points and 12 rebounds to lead the 
Sentinels to their 12th consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach advanced with an 81-69 victory over Trabuco Hills as 6-foot-5 
forward Tony Gonzalez scored 30 points for the Oilers. Gonzalez, who will 
attend California on a football scholarship, is averaging 25 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
 In Division II-A, Redondo (21-7) plays third-seeded Pacific of San Bernardino 
(24-3) at North Torrance High, and Mira Costa (22-6) faces second-seeded St. 
John Bosco of Bellflower (25-2) at Cypress College. 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo blew a 17-point, second-quarter lead before recovering to defeat 
Charter Oak of Covina, 65-60, in overtime Tuesday. Senior guard Damani 
Washington led the Sea Hawks with 18 points, nine coming in the fourth quarter 
and overtime. Pacific had an easier time in its second-round game, beating 
Norco, 89-72. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mira Costa-St. John Bosco match-up features two outstanding guards. 
Hawaii-bound Shane Willis scored 27 points Tuesday to lead Mira Costa over Paso 
Robles, 64-44. St. John Bosco is led by Jelani Gardner, a highly regarded 
college prospect. The Braves, who beat West Torrance, 79-61, in the first 
round, used their pressure defense to stifle La Mirada, 68-42, Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Serra (16-9), which did not play Tuesday, meets Village Christian at Inglewood 
High in the Division IV-A quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Star (18-7) has a tough assignment in Division V-AA, playing at 
top-seeded Brentwood (20-6). The Stars withstood a 41-point effort by Pilgrim's 
Victor Dean to post a 73-71 victory Tuesday. Tony DiLeva led three Mary Star 
players in double figures with 21 points. Brentwood advanced with a 69-50

Pedro. 
</P>

scoreboard, which cost $9,000 including installation. 
</P>
<P>
 Brunkhardt was quarterback on the Mira Costa freshman football team and a 
member of the junior varsity soccer and baseball teams. ROOKIE NOMINEE

LAW ENFORCEMENT: A TRIBUTE TO SLAIN OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Feb. 14, we were all shocked and appalled to learn of the deaths of Capt. 
Michael Tracy and Sgt. Tom Vanderpool of the Palos Verdes Estates Police 
Department. Over the years, Peninsula residents have come to know and respect 
the members of the department as well as the other uniformed police officers 
who serve us well.These men and women put their lives on the line on a daily 
basis to protect and serve the members of our community and schools. 
</P>
<P>
 A senseless killing such as this serves to remind us of how precious human 
life is and also how fragile it can be. Their dedication will always be 
remembered. 
</P>
<P>
 Our hearts go out to the families and friends of these brave and wonderful 
men. The Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District, its board, teachers, 
staff and students will always be indebted to these courageous men.

CHARITY: THANKS TO ALL WHO CONTRIBUTED

<P>
 Now that things have calmed down after the holiday season, Cheer for Children 
wants to thank the South Bay community and the Los Angeles Times South Bay 
Edition in particular for the support that enabled us to provide toys, food, 
clothing and shoe certificates for nearly 600 local children and families. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, South Bay groups such as the employees of Northrop and 
Hewlett-Packard, Hughes Women Forum, M.K. Diamond, North Redondo Rotary and 
others too numerous to mention were instrumental in providing money and food 
for the needy. 
</P>
<P>
 Big thanks are also in order to Century Cable for their toy drive, as well as 
all the places where Cheer for Children had boxes for toys, including the 
Redondo Beach Chamber of Commerce, both Redondo Beach fire stations, Sport 
Center at King Harbor, Torrance Holiday Inn, Discovery Travel, Viking Cleaners 
and Chris Oliver's Champion Chevrolet. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks also to all the wonderful people who helped wrap all of those presents 
and entertain at our childrens' parties, including the various South Bay Scout 
groups and the South Bay Volunteer Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year was a particularly tough one for many local families, but people 
like you made sure they were not forgotten during the holidays. You should all 
be proud.

 TAX DEADLINE: Time is rapidly running out for homeowners to defer their 
property taxes or seek lower assessments because of quake damage. You have 
until March 17 to pick up the proper forms at the county assessor's office on 
6640 Van Nuys Blvd., Van Nuys, or call (213) 974-7394. . . . Already, 10,000 
forms have been filed, with the final figure expected to reach 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 GRAFFITI WAR: Many people say Santa Clarita is a pretty conservative place, 
and they might be right. But not when it comes to fighting graffiti. . . . The 
city has started selling T-shirts depicting two wolves urinating on a rock next 
to two youths spray-painting graffiti on a wall. The caption reads: "What's the 
diff?" (B20) 
</P>
<P>
 RICH PITCHER: Poor Jack McDowell. He asked the Chicago White Sox for $6.5 
million, but an arbitrator ruled this week that he isn't worth a penny more 
than $5.3 million. Wonder how he'll pay the bills now. . . . Still, before you 
start a collection, you should know that McDowell, above, a graduate of Notre 
Dame High in Sherman Oaks, will make more than any ex-Valley baseball player 
has in one season. 
</P>
<P>
 QUAKE QUIPS: We must be moving beyond the quake because now even some folks at 
Cal State Northridge are starting to poke fun at their troubles. The basketball 
gym has already been dubbed The Epicenter, and there's talk of changing the 
team name from the Matadors to the Quakes (C10). . . . But why stop there? Why 
not have fans shake the wooden bleachers by stomping their feet? 
</P>
<P>
 NEW JESUS: His mother was not a virgin, he never claimed to be divine and he 
was born in Nazareth, not Bethlehem. That's only a sample from the new studies 
by Bible scholars painting a less glamorous portrait of Jesus. And not everyone 
is happy about it (E1). . . . Said Michael Barrett, a CSUN librarian, who 
attended a North Hollywood class that re-examined the interpretation of Jesus: 
"It's about finding your own spirituality." Michael Arkush

 HOLD THE SMOKE: Go ahead. Order the Big Mac, the fries, the chocolate 
milkshake -- but hold that after-fast-food cigarette. . . . Anti-smoking 
advocates in Ventura County hailed a decision by McDonald's Corp. to banish 
smoking in all its company-owned restaurants nationwide. (D1) "We feel really 
good about it," said Jerry Leavitt of the Smoking Action Coalition, which 
pushed for no-smoking laws in Ventura and Ojai. . . . But not all restaurateurs 
agree. Many showed up at a Camarillo City Council meeting to oppose a ban on 
smoking in restaurants in that city (B1). 
</P>
<P>
 LOST CONNECTION: Seems like only yesterday that Moorpark officials were eager 
for the Simi Valley-Moorpark freeway connector to ease traffic on local 
streets. Now they're worried that commuters whiz by, oblivious to what the city 
has to offer. . . . The city wants permission from the state Department of 
Transportation to put up signs along the connector touting Moorpark's historic 
downtown business district. But Caltrans says it has no record of the request. 
. . . "We're somehow lost in the twilight zone on the deal," Councilman Scott 
Montgomery said. "A lot of people look for the Old Town area. Since the 
connector has gone in, they haven't been able to find it." 
</P>
<P>
 HELPING OUT: Volunteering to help people in need is hard to do for busy 
Ventura County residents, but many somehow find the time (Ventura County Life, 
Page 24). . . . Experts offer tips on getting started and who needs assistance. 
Since the Jan. 17 earthquake, help is needed more than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 SAVE THE TREES: Living up to the city's name, officials in Thousand Oaks 
approved a law to give some trees historic designation. . . . Under the 
Historical Tree Project, officials will mark the city's most significant trees 
with plaques, and perhaps map out a walking arboreal tour of the Conejo Valley. 
. . . "It's nice to see that, despite the severe economic pressures we face, we 
will remain true to our name," Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski said.

CAMARILLO BACKS SWEEPING BAN ON SMOKING; GOVERNMENT: MERCHANTS SAY THE ACTION 
COULD DRIVE THEM OUT OF BUSINESS. THE ORDINANCE WILL GO BEFORE THE COUNCIL ONE 
MORE TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Camarillo City Council members late Wednesday unanimously approved a sweeping 
ban on smoking in public places, despite the objections of merchants who said 
the move could drive them out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're only attempting to protect the rights of those who don't smoke," 
Councilman Mike Morgan said. "Businesses aren't always affected if there's no 
smoking. Studies have shown that people adjust to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the ordinance is still subject to approval at a second reading next 
month, the unanimous decision left no doubt that Camarillo will become the 
fifth Ventura County city to adopt tougher smoking laws since July. Ventura 
County has passed a similar ordinance for unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the ordinance burst into applause after the tighter restrictions 
were approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is nasty business, second-hand smoke," said Michael Burgos of Camarillo. 
"It's a health issue. The public has a right to be protected." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 75 supporters and opponents of the proposal crowded into the council 
chambers for a debate that lasted nearly four hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Some business owners told the council they could not survive the new law, 
which prohibits smoking in virtually every restaurant, shop and workplace in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my restaurant, my business," said Dorothy Walden, who owns Dorothy's 
Chuck Wagon on Ventura Boulevard. "I don't understand why government has a 
right to do this. I've put 11 years of sweat and tears into that business, and 
if this goes through, I have a very bad feeling I'll be on the welfare rolls." 
</P>
<P>
 But supporters of the ordinance said studies have shown that businesses do not 
suffer from such laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is one business that is hurt by these ordinances: the tobacco 
business," said Nan Waltman, an educator with the Ventura County Health 
Department. "Smoking bans work because they are popular." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Wallace of Thousand Oaks, a former smoker who works with tobacco users, 
said: "I have not found one person who said, 'Let's not go to that restaurant 
because we can't smoke.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Charlotte Craven, one of two council members who served on a 
committee that recommended the ordinance, cited health concerns as the primary 
impetus behind it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason we're looking at this is to keep the public and employees from 
being exposed to secondhand smoke," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harry Lundgren, a retired plumber from Ventura, said smokers have rights 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have lung cancer, but I believe it's my right to die of lung cancer," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lundgren said he spoke against a similar ordinance recently approved by the 
Ventura City Council, and said officials there ignored a petition he presented 
with thousands of signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't even look at it," he said. "This should be put to a vote of the 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Several supporters of the Camarillo ordinance cited Tuesday's report in the 
Journal of the American Medical Assn., which for the first time linked toxins 
from secondhand smoke to the fetuses of pregnant women who never smoked. 
</P>
<P>
 Lundgren was unimpressed. "This is just something that's come up to influence 
people," he told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance, which will take effect 30 days after its final adoption, 
restricts smoking in virtually every business accessible to the public except 
tobacco shops and some bars. Half of the rooms in hotels and motels will have 
to be reserved for nonsmokers. Cigarette vending machines will be allowed only 
within 25 feet of the front door of bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Cocktail lounges will be exempted, but bars and lounges connected to 
restaurants will be forced to build a separate ventilation system. Bar and 
restaurant owners will be given 10 months to make ventilation changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal drew skepticism and resentment by those who lobby for tobacco 
rights professionally. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like the standard California intolerance that is so popular these 
days," said Tom Lauria, a spokesman for the Washington-based Tobacco Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't give business owners or customers the right of 
self-determination," Lauria said. "Camarillo is endorsing tobacco apartheid 
over fairness, and it's based on the floppiest science available." 
</P>
<P>
 A group of tobacco and restaurant lobbyists is working to put before 
California voters a proposition that would, among other things, guarantee that 
25% of restaurant seating allow smoking, the state attorney general's office 
said.

COUNTY PLANS HEALTH CLINIC IN FILLMORE; MEDICINE: OFFICIALS AT FACILITIES 
NEARBY ARE CRITICAL, SAYING AREA'S LOW-INCOME RESIDENTS ARE ALREADY 
WELL-SERVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County health officials hope to open a health clinic for the poor in 
Fillmore by summer -- a move that two existing clinics say would undermine 
their businesses and reveal the county's intent to compete for patients, not 
just provide a safety net for the needy. 
</P>
<P>
 The new county clinic would also hurt struggling Santa Paula Memorial 
Hospital, Executive Director Rulon J. Barlow said, by routing Medi-Cal patients 
from Fillmore past nearby Santa Paula to the county hospital in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're concerned," Barlow said. "They'll say they're only providing for people 
who can't get care. And, in some places, that's a true statement. In Fillmore, 
I don't think it's a true statement." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials confirmed Wednesday that they are shopping for a vacant lot 
in Fillmore to relocate a 5,000-square-foot portable building as the county's 
sixth clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been looking at Fillmore for some time because we recognize the need is 
there," said Pierre Durand, administrator of the county hospital and its 
expanding network of clinics. "We hope to be there within the next six months." 
</P>
<P>
 Durand said many patients from the Fillmore and Piru areas show up at a county 
clinic in Santa Paula and at the county hospital in Ventura, indicating a 
strong need for care that is not being met by existing clinics and doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor do any of the existing clinics offer access to the broad spectrum of 
specialists and treatments that the county system provides, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The final decision on opening a Fillmore clinic will be made by the County 
Board of Supervisors, which has not considered the issue, he said. In the past 
year, the board has approved opening clinics in Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley, 
adding to a network that includes facilities in Oxnard, Ventura and Santa 
Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 But directors of the two private clinics in Fillmore said their community's 
low-income residents are already well-served and that the county is responding 
not to the needs of the poor but to a desire to lure Medi-Cal patients -- 
especially the lucrative obstetrics practice -- to the county hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The county is also positioning itself to compete with private hospitals and 
doctors for patients, the administrators said. Their comments echoed recent 
charges by officials at the private Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a waste of taxpayers' money for them to set up in Fillmore," said 
Roberto S. Juarez, executive director of Clinicas del Camino Real, which runs 
four not-for-profit clinics in Ventura County. "I don't see duplicating 
services and spending taxpayers' money to set up an empire." 
</P>
<P>
 Juarez said his Fillmore clinic, which is temporarily housed in trailers 
because of earthquake damage, usually sees 1,500 patients a month, most of whom 
are poor and insured by Medi-Cal. Fillmore has about 12,000 residents and Piru 
1,150. 
</P>
<P>
 James Howatt, who operates the four-physician Fillmore Medical Clinic, said 
Fillmore's doctors and clinics provide good health care for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "This stinks. It's not needed," he said. "It would make the county hospital 
healthier, but it would destroy care at Santa Paula Hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 Howatt said Durand approached him 18 months ago about buying his clinic 
building and sending all 500 of his hospital patients a year to the county 
hospital, rather than to the Santa Paula hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was basically an all-or-nothing sort of thing," Howatt said. "You can 
fight us or join us. . . . It appears the county is planning to make good on 
their threat to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Howatt said 75% of his patients are privately insured, not Medi-Cal patients. 
So county officials were clearly interested in funneling privately insured 
patients into its hospital, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted all of my commercial contracts," he said. "They wanted access to 
all of my fee-for-service and HMO contracts. They wanted to take over my office 
. . . which is a different story than what they've been feeding the papers." 
</P>
<P>
 Durand acknowledged some "very preliminary discussions" with Howatt in 1992, 
but said that they did not get specific. It was never his intention to capture 
privately insured patients for the county hospital, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not go after the private sector," he said. "Our mission is to provide 
access to the poor, to the unemployed, to the underemployed (without private 
insurance)." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, fewer than 10% of the county's patients are privately insured, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Howatt said he rejected the county's offer partly because of the damage it 
would have done to Santa Paula Hospital, which gets between one-third and 
one-half of all its baby deliveries each year from Howatt's practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Howatt also said he told Durand that he could not serve Fillmore adequately if 
he delivered babies 25 miles away in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said we'll have our residents deliver them and you can bill for the 
service, and that's the truth," Howatt said. "I don't know what that is, but it 
doesn't seem quite right. . . . It came out of Pierre Durand's mouth." 
</P>
<P>
 Durand denied making any such statement and dubbed Howatt's comments 
outrageous. He said it would have been illegal for Howatt to claim deliveries 
he never made. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is not an acceptable practice any place, and he knows that very well," 
Durand said. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, Durand declined to comment on his negotiations with Howatt and on 
the critical comments by Juarez. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to get into one physician says this and someone else says 
that," he said. "Our record speaks for itself. Our record is one of providing 
services for the poor population." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A county clinic is needed in Fillmore, he said, because other clinics and 
doctors accept only some poor patients. An increasing number of indigents and 
the working poor have trouble getting care because the state provides little or 
no reimbursement, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And a Medi-Cal patient who needs surgery is often referred to the county 
hospital because of low state reimbursement, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel Edwards, medical director at the county hospital, said clinics such as 
Howatt's are restrictive on which Medi-Cal patients they will see. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's skimming the best he can," Edwards said. "He's taking the ones that make 
money, and not taking the ones that don't make money. We take them all."

ELECTIONS / BOARD OF SUPERVISORS; MADGE SCHAEFER SAYS SHE'LL RUN FOR HER OLD 
SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Ventura County Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer, who advised after her 
narrow 1990 defeat to Maria VanderKolk to "never say goodby to Madge," 
announced Wednesday that she is a candidate for her old job. 
</P>
<P>
 Pledging to make crime-fighting her top priority if elected, Schaefer, 51, 
launched her campaign at a press conference in front of the East County 
Sheriff's Station. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're locking ourselves in, and criminals are having the run of the streets," 
Schaefer said. "This is the No. 1 issue that people are concerned about. We've 
got to take back our streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Schaefer is the fourth person to enter the race for the 2nd District 
supervisor's seat now held by VanderKolk, who is not seeking reelection. 
Thousand Oaks City Councilman Frank Schillo and taxpayer advocate H. Jere 
Robings will also compete for the seat, representing most of the Conejo Valley 
and Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 And attorney Trudi K. Loh, 37, said Wednesday that she plans to formally 
announce her candidacy later this month. The Thousand Oaks resident said her 
campaign will focus on creating new jobs and reducing crime in the east county. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to be going door-to-door to find out what the voters want in their 
next supervisor," said Loh, who will be making her first run for public office. 
"I'm an attorney, and I'm basically looking at this as a job interview with the 
voters." 
</P>
<P>
 At least three other potential candidates have pulled nomination papers and 
are considering entering the race. They are former Assembly candidate Alan 
Guggenheim, county corrections officer David Goodman and Oak Park resident Alan 
H. Knapp. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During her press conference Wednesday, Schaefer said she decided to run after 
canvassing Thousand Oaks' neighborhoods and talking with voters one-on-one 
about her potential candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started ringing doorbells and reintroducing myself to people, telling them 
I wanted to be a candidate," said Schaefer, who ran unsuccessfully for the 
state Assembly in 1992. "I was really pleased with the response." 
</P>
<P>
 Since January, Schaefer said she has collected signatures of nearly 2,000 
registered voters to help get her name placed on the June 7 ballot. The county 
requires a total of 2,582 signatures or a filing fee of $645 to place a 
candidate's name on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaefer said that in her conversations with voters, she found that the issue 
most important to them was the increasing incidence of violent crime, 
particularly in the east county. "People are really frightened," she said. 
"They are really scared about what's happening in society with violence." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To combat crime, she pledged to expand the county's anti-drug and gang 
prevention program, and to protect law enforcement services from further budget 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaefer, a veteran of 20 years on government boards in Thousand Oaks and the 
county, lost her supervisor's post in 1990 to VanderKolk by 102 votes in an 
upset described as the most stunning in a Ventura County campaign since the 
1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, she was criticized for being too chummy with developers and 
waging her campaign as a sure thing. She used only about half of the $40,000 in 
her campaign treasury, and spent the week before the election in New York on 
county business. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was clearly the perception that because I went to New York that I 
didn't care about the race," Schaefer said Wednesday. "What did I learn? I 
learned that perception is the same as reality. And I accept full 
responsibility for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction to Schaefer's announcement among her rivals and county officials was 
mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoever is in the race is (insignificant) as far as my campaign is 
concerned," Schillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robings also downplayed the significance of Schaefer's candidacy. "It's no 
surprise," he said. "She's certainly welcome to get in the race. It's certain 
to generate some different issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor John K. Flynn, who often disagreed with Schaefer when she was on 
the board, was more critical in his assessment of her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that Madge has had an opportunity to sit on the board, and she 
really failed to pay attention to her district and she lost," said Flynn, who 
represents the 5th District. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard for me to figure why she wants to try it all over again," Flynn 
said. "I think there are much better candidates out there to take the place of 
Maria VanderKolk." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk herself declined to comment on Schaefer's prospects for winning 
back her old seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really trying to stay out of the race," she said. "I wish her well, as I 
do every candidate running for office." 
</P>
<P>
 Schaefer's daughters -- Heather Schaefer, 22, and Holly Henebry, 27 -- who 
joined their mother at Wednesday's press conference, said the family fully 
supports the former supervisor's decision to jump in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's got so much to give," Heather Schaefer said. "She's been committed to 
this county since I can remember. She is really and truly out there for the 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no hidden agendas," Henebry agreed. "This is what she loves." 
</P>
<P>
 Others who turned out to show their support for Schaefer at a second news 
conference in Port Hueneme on Wednesday afternoon were Port Hueneme City 
Councilman Dorill B. Wright and former mayor and councilman Ray D. Prueter. 
</P>
<P>
 During her press conference in front of the Ray Prueter Library, Schaefer said 
that if elected supervisor, she would look for ways to lease surplus properties 
owned by the county's library district to generate additional income to expand 
library hours and services.

COUNTY RECEIVES A LARGER SHARE OF U. S. JOBS AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County has received a higher-than-expected $2.2 million in federal 
emergency funds to hire workers who lost jobs or businesses during the Jan. 17 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 State labor officials say the county's share of the $28 million in federal 
assistance was higher because the county lost more jobs in the earthquake than 
originally thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "The information we got from businesses that were damaged and from individuals 
filing for unemployment claims in Ventura County changed our estimates," said 
spokeswoman Suzanne Schroeder of the state Employment Development Department. 
"The numbers from Ventura County came in higher than we initially expected." 
</P>
<P>
 Unemployment insurance claims in Ventura County filed by individuals who cited 
the earthquake as the cause of their unemployment have risen to 2,051 through 
Saturday, Schroeder said. Statewide, a total of 25,750 people have applied for 
unemployment because of the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Counting the self-employed and others ineligible for unemployment insurance, 
at least 4,300 county residents have lost their livelihoods because of the 
quake, local job officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal funds -- part of the $9 billion in earthquake relief money 
approved by Congress -- will be administered by the Job Training Policy Council 
of Ventura County. The money -- which will pay for more than 1,000 county 
residents to work for up to six months -- follows an initial emergency grant of 
$200,000 that the job council received immediately after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "This program has two immediate benefits for the county," said Jacqueline 
Richardson, the job council's chairwoman. "On the one hand, it aims to provide 
employment for the person who lost their job because of the earthquake. And, on 
the other hand, the people employed will work on public sector projects aimed 
at repairing the damage done by the quake." 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Nakhleh, a general contractor from Ventura, saw his business dry up 
overnight when the earthquake struck during the pre-dawn hours Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had some jobs in Simi Valley, but I had to put them all on hold because my 
customers were waiting for money from federal disaster officials or waiting for 
inspectors to inspect the damage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakhleh, 51, has been a contractor for nine years. Because he is 
self-employed, he was not eligible for standard unemployment insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no safety net for someone like me," he said. "You don't qualify for 
unemployment, and most jobs you apply for you are either over-qualified, 
under-qualified or they've got a million applicants just like you." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Nakhleh, state employment officials were able to use money 
from the initial federal grant to hire him to help in the laborious task of 
cleaning up hard-hit Simi Valley High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Since last week, Nakhleh has put his construction experience to use helping 
private contractors assess what can be salvaged and what must be rebuilt at the 
school, which is less than 10 miles from the earthquake's epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 During a walk through the school grounds, Nakhleh pointed to the extensive 
damage to structural beams, walkways and classroom ceilings. Loosely stacked 
desks were piled on the lawn outside the classrooms, along with racks of 
student pottery that somehow managed to survive intact. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to see a building hit by a train to compare the destruction," he 
said. "Look around. It's devastation. Even in their worst nightmares, school 
administrators couldn't have expected this." 
</P>
<P>
 Saying he was never the type to stand in an unemployment line, Nakhleh said he 
was glad to have the chance to make a difference at the high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The work here had to be done by someone," he said.

 Former First Lady Nancy Reagan will greet visitors and sign autographs at the 
Ronald Reagan Presidential Library today, library officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Reagan will appear in the library gift shop from 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. 
to sign copies of her autobiography and other books on former first ladies. 
</P>
<P>
 The visit to the facility near Simi Valley coincides with the debut this week

 "Dining in the White House" features an authentic state dinner table setting, 
including official china, flatware, candlesticks, menus and place cards. In 
addition, a five-minute video entitled "The Honor of Your Presence" offers a 
behind-the-scenes view of how a formal White House dinner is planned and 
prepared.

 Also on display is an exhibit called "The People's House," which includes more 
than two dozen renderings of the executive mansion, ranging from a homemade 
quilt to a ceramic cookie jar.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY'S HOME SALES FALL 8.6% IN JANUARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sales of new and existing Ventura County homes dropped by 8.6% in January, 
compared to the same period last year, according to a report released Wednesday 
by TRW-REDI Property Data. 
</P>
<P>
 The analyst who published the data for the national real estate information 
company warned, however, against putting too much stock in one month's sales 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall in 1993, Ventura County had the healthiest housing market in Southern 
California, with 5.4% more homes selling last year than in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the county's housing market is so small -- only 444 homes sold 
countywide last month, compared to 486 homes in January, 1993 -- the numbers 
can easily be misleading, said TRW-REDI's Nima Nattagh. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few transactions more or less can translate into large percentage changes," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Local realtors said the market seems to be gaining strength rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Houses are moving," said Tricia Onsgard, a realtor with Brown-Realtors in 
Westlake. "My last four listings have all sold within a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcy Cutting, a realtor with Jon Douglas Company Realtors in Ventura, said 
buyers finally feel the time and prices are right to buy a home. "People are 
feeling that prices and interest rates are as low as they are going to get," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The average selling price of homes in Ventura County was $219,747 in January, 
1994, a drop of 1.5% from the previous January. Home prices in the county 
dropped 1.6% to $234,381 between 1992 and 1993. CONSTANCE SOMMER

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: RECYCLING HOT LINE ADDS SPANISH SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials operating a 2-year-old recycling hot line have added Spanish to the 
telephone service to attract more callers and to better alert the Latino 
population to the variety of recycling information available. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Recycling Consortium, a group of public agencies and 
private businesses that promotes recycling, announced the addition Tuesday, 
saying the sizable Spanish-speaking community in Ventura County needs better 
access to the recycling services offered locally. 
</P>
<P>
 "By providing recycling information in Spanish, more Ventura County residents 
will have access to recycling information and (that) will allow for greater 
participation in recycling programs countywide," said Jay Duncan, who 
coordinates the recycling program for Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 25% of Ventura County residents are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 County solid waste officials estimate that more than 200,000 tons of wood, 
newsprint, glass, aluminum and other materials were recycled in Ventura County 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But that represents just 20% of the materials that could be reclaimed, 
according to Toni Moran, a waste management analyst for Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to do better," said Moran, who estimated that the hot line now 
receives more than 100 calls a month. "We have to increase that to 25% by 1995 
under (state law), and then to 50% by the year 2000." 
</P>
<P>
 For information about various recycling programs or to find out where or how 
to dispose of hazardous materials, call 654-3935. JEFF McDONALD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CITY WILL BUY 11 LOTS ON RIDGELINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks will purchase 11 prominent ridgeline lots in the Skyline Area 
for $46,750 after all, as Councilman Frank Schillo has reversed his earlier 
"no" vote and decided to endorse the acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 A tour of the area persuaded him that the parcels would make an ideal trail 
head for hikers and equestrians, Schillo said. Although last week he voted 
against the purchase, arguing that the city should spend the money elsewhere, 
Schillo said he changed his mind after learning that the Skyline Area lots link 
up to the Los Robles trail system. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday night, he called on his colleagues to rescind last week's vote and 
start the debate afresh. Bolstered by the new information, Councilwoman Jaime 
Zukowski joined Schillo in changing from a "no" to a "yes" vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "My eyes have been opened -- this is a good opportunity for us," Schillo said. 
"I'm convinced that trail heads are pretty important to our community. Here's a 
chance to buy one for $46,000 and at the same time, eliminate the possibility 
that someone will come and build a house on one of those parcels, a house that 
could be seen from as far away as Agoura." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Mayor Elois Zeanah cast the only vote opposing purchase of the 
Skyline Area lots, which are on sale because the property owner has failed to 
pay taxes for the past seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah said she could not support using park funds, which come from the taxes 
developers pay on each bedroom they build in the community, for the purchase. 
She also chastised Schillo for seeking to change his vote. 
</P>
<P>
 But other council members called the purchase a bargain. They pointed out that 
the city recently approved several goals for the Skyline Area, including 
acquisition of sensitive ridgeline lots to preserve the region's rural feel. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Grant Brimhall said Wednesday he believes the sale will go 
through soon. The Ventura County tax collector is obligated to offer the 
property to the city before auctioning it to private developers, he said.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CITY COMPROMISES ON TV COVERAGE

<P>
 A heated dispute over the use of the Thousand Oaks government television 
station, TOTV, to cover City Council committee meetings ended in a compromise 
early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Elois Zeanah had proposed airing two upcoming crime prevention task 
force meetings on the city's station, Channel 10, because she believed the 
issues being discussed were important for public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilwoman Judy Lazar protested Zeanah's proposal, saying it was 
politically motivated and inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Committee meetings are supposed to be working sessions," Lazar said. "It's an 
informal event. It's not meant to be televised." 
</P>
<P>
 At 2 a.m., during a lengthy council meeting, the two argued the point for 
about 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 When the exchange became heated, Councilman Alex Fiore stepped in and 
suggested that the city air one meeting on TOTV and broadcast the second 
meeting on public access television. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members approved the plan 5 to 0 and said they would take up the issue 
of televising committee meetings at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other issues on the agenda Tuesday night, including debate over a 
possible children's museum in the city, were postponed because of the length of 
the public hearing. MATTHEW MOSK

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; NAVY DIVER HELD AFTER ROOFTOP DISTURBANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Navy diver was taken into custody Wednesday morning after he climbed onto a 
garage roof in an upscale Oxnard neighborhood and began hurling clay tiles at 
passing cars, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of a condo complex in the Mandalay Bay area called police to report 
a disturbance about 8:15 a.m. When officers arrived, they found Glen Alan 
Vienneau, 32, standing atop a single-story garage, cracking ceramic tiles and 
lobbing the pieces at cars on Harbor Boulevard and at homes inside the complex, 
said David Keith, an Oxnard police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was babbling and cussing," said Oxnard Firefighter Jim Guth, whose engine 
company was summoned to place a ladder against the garage. "He never gave us 
any reason why he was up there. He was just yelling at the cops." 
</P>
<P>
 Guth said Vienneau, clad in a pair of shorts, was holding a tape recorder and 
at times pulled cassettes from his shorts. "He would holler that his batteries 
were dead," Guth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vienneau was apprehended when an officer jumped onto the roof and sprayed him 
with cayenne-based pepper spray. Vienneau tried to flee, but was caught by 
waiting officers and turned over to military police. He was later taken to the 
medical hospital at Camp Pendleton, north of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his run-in with police Wednesday morning, Vienneau is facing a 
criminal trial in Las Vegas next month for allegedly beating and trying to rape 
a 21-year-old woman after forcing his way into her room at the Flamingo Hilton, 
officials said. He was absent without leave at the time from his Port Hueneme 
base. A Nevada judge allowed him to return to Port Hueneme pending the start of 
that trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to the residents' call Wednesday to Oxnard police, Vienneau called the 
Sheriff's Department to his home on Sunset Lane about 7 a.m. to report 
vandalism. But when deputies arrived, they found no evidence of a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Vienneau is a first-class petty officer assigned to the underwater 
construction team at the U.S. Naval Construction Battalion in Port Hueneme, a 
unit that travels around the world doing underwater repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Vienneau has been in the Navy about 12 years and on the dive team for a year 
and a half, said Lt. Marc Myrum, the second-ranking commander of the dive team.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; DRIVER PLEADS GUILTY IN DEATH OF MAN, 52 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 23-year-old Oxnard man pleaded guilty on Wednesday to a charge of felony 
vehicular manslaughter in connection with the death of a government employee, 
who was struck and killed as he rode his motor scooter to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabino S. Olivera faces up to 10 years in prison for the death of William 
Jerry Blue, an 18-year federal government worker and a father of 
three.Olivera's plea came just as he was set to go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue, a 52-year-old, oil-platform inspector from Ojai, was on his way home 
from his job when Olivera struck and killed him on Vineyard Avenue near Central 
Avenue last September. Police said Olivera was driving drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 For Blue's widow, Gayle, 49, Olivera's plea spared her the agony of having to 
relive the events surrounding the death of her husband, who rode his scooter to 
work daily. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been riding that scooter since he was 15," she said. "His office was in 
Camarillo, and he would go the back way, thinking that would be safer. He would 
never get on the highway." 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records, Blue was struck from behind by Olivera's pickup 
truck at 4:40 p.m. Deputy Dist. Atty. Stacy A. Ratner said the defendant was 
driving 70 m.p.h., had crossed over double yellow lines and tailgated another 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Olivera is being held in the Ventura County Jail pending sentencing March 23.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: COUNCIL URGES MORE RADAR STATION STUDIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Paula City Council has unanimously passed a resolution urging the 
federal government to conduct further environmental studies before turning on 
its weather-tracking station on top of Sulphur Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution formally endorses pending congressional legislation introduced 
by Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) that would force the National Weather 
Service to conduct studies over the next year looking at the health effects of 
low-level radiation emitted by the 98-foot-tall radar tower.The tower is 
scheduled to be partially operational next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who live near the radar station have tried but failed to halt the 
use of the tower in state and federal court. They have succeeded in garnering 
support from state and local politicians, including U.S. Sens. Barbara Boxer 
and Dianne Feinstein of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula's resolution, passed by the council Tuesday night, is similar to 
those adopted by the Ventura County Board of Supervisors and the Ojai City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite little evidence showing any potential risks for Santa Paula residents 
from the tower's emissions, the council decided to push for further studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems pretty clear that (the Weather Service) did not conduct the proper 
environmental review," said Councilman John Melton.  
</P>
<P>
 The council heard from more than a dozen residents who live near the site, 
many sporting colorful new T-shirts emblazoned with "Move the Tower" along with 
a replica of the Evard Munch painting of "The Scream" and an image of the radar 
tower. Some residents became teary as they detailed their concerns to the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a 10- and 11-year-old and planned on raising my children up there," 
said Linda Fuller, choking back tears. "We're terrified about what it might do. 
It's not fair." SCOTT HADLY

SIMI VALLEY CAMPUS OFFICERS CALM FEARS, SEARCH FOR WEAPONS; SAFETY: THE SLAYING 
OF A STUDENT PROMPTED BOOST IN PATROLS, BUT OFFICERS SAY MUCH OF THEIR TIME IS 
SPENT QUELLING FALSE RUMORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two weeks after the campus slaying of a 14-year-old boy prompted Simi Valley 
to boost its one-man school patrol to four officers, police say two things are 
certain: The schools are generally safe, but kids will be kids. And most kids 
are good. 
</P>
<P>
 The extra officers temporarily assigned to Simi Valley's junior and senior 
high schools have been focusing on quelling rumors and seizing weapons, said 
Lt. John Ainsworth, their commander. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their primary responsibility is dealing with security issues, answering 
questions and looking for weapons on campus," said Ainsworth, head of the 
Special Enforcement Detail, which has increased its school patrols to four 
officers until at least March 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Feb. 1 stabbing death of Valley View Junior High student Chad 
Hubbard, the officers have been patrolling the schools on foot and in marked 
cruisers, trying to calm students, teachers and parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more we can keep down the rumors, the safer everybody feels," said 
Officer Steve Ming. "There's all kinds of rumors: 'Everybody has a knife.' 
'There's going to be a fight.' 'Gang members have been involved in a fight.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Officers have confiscated pocket knives, realistic toy handguns and all types 
of graffiti tools -- but the rumors far outnumber the seizures, Officer John 
St. Laurent said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most kids have never actually seen a weapon," said St. Laurent, who has been 
patrolling the city's schools for three years and worked as the DARE anti-drug 
officer for five. 
</P>
<P>
 When word gets out about a weapon or a fight, Ainsworth said, "Kids may tend 
to embellish things and make it sound worse than it is, to impress their 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Students at Valley View School applauded the extra patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better if they're here after school, because that's when most fights 
happen and the kids, if they see them, they'll stop," said Christie Wilson, 13, 
an eighth-grader. 
</P>
<P>
 "The teachers say stuff like, 'Even if there are cops on campus, it really 
wouldn't have mattered' " in Chad's death, said Joey DiFatta, a 14-year-old 
ninth-grader on the school's safety committee. "But a lot of the kids feel 
safer." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to weapons searches and rumor control, the expanded patrol handles 
the same types of cases seen when St. Laurent alone patrolled the schools -- 
drugs, graffiti, gangs and fights over girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Some days bring a rash of one type of case, other days a mix, he said. And 
every day, Ming, St. Laurent and the other officers check out tips and keep 
tabs on kids who have caused trouble in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Ming and St. Laurent began and ended their afternoon with tips 
on marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 They came from a teacher at Hillside Junior High, to whom a student turned in 
an envelope full of suspected marijuana. Its contents turned out to be real 
grass, or as Ming jokingly put it, "freshly mowed schoolyard." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Later at Royal High School, the officers had a student pulled out of class and 
brought to them in the assistant principal's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to lay it out straight, flat and complete," St. Laurent said, 
staring down the 18-year-old. "We've had not one, not two, but mega-complaints 
about your dealing." 
</P>
<P>
 "Me? No, I'm not dealing drugs," he replied, shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
 So it went -- calm accusations and increasingly firm denials -- until the 
officers obtained the teen-ager's permission to frisk him and search his 
backpack. 
</P>
<P>
 They found no drugs, just a pack of cigarettes that was confiscated by the 
assistant principal and a ballpoint sketch of a marijuana pipe emblazoned with 
the words "Hemp saves all." 
</P>
<P>
 With a stern warning, they let him go, unconvinced he was innocent, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, this is how the day goes, whether it's gangs or drugs," St. 
Laurent said after their interview and search of a second student also found no 
evidence to back a tip that he was dealing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Most kids are good, St. Laurent said, and the ratio of bad ones is about the 
same as adults -- 2% to 5% are breaking the law. 
</P>
<P>
 They moved on to Sequoia Junior High. There, Ming warned a girl he would come 
down hard on her if she got caught for gang activity, while St. Laurent tried 
to chill a rivalry over a girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Rejected by a former girlfriend, the boy had sent his older brother to another 
school to beat up a boy who was now dating her, according to yet another 
anonymous tip. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy had been arrested for tagging earlier in the year and looked to be 
headed for gang life like his older brother, St. Laurent said. But the officer 
lobbied to keep him on the school basketball squad, and the kid had been 
straight since then, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy agreed to call off his brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't mess up like your brother did," St. Laurent warned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't worry," the boy answered soberly. "I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The last tip led St. Laurent and Ming to another junior high. They asked that 
it not be named because of continuing investigations into marijuana dealing 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 They gently but firmly questioned a 13-year-old girl who first denied, then 
tearfully admitted, that she had been selling marijuana to schoolmates. 
</P>
<P>
 After calling the girl's father and telling him she would probably be 
expelled, St. Laurent answered a call to his pager. It was yet another tip -- 
that a student at Royal High School had been seen carrying a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a constant influx of information," he said. "Keeping track of who did 
what. The kids trust us. They have faith in us. They know I won't break their 
confidence."

SCHOOL BOARD VOTES TO FORM SAFETY PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDA DAY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Simi Valley school board on Wednesday voted to form an executive-level 
committee of administrators and city leaders to come up with quick steps to 
ensure that campuses are safe. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel of school board members, administrators and top-level city officials 
was formed in response to the fatal stabbing of a student at Valley View Junior 
High School three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The move came at the urging of board member Doug Crosse, who has complained 
that a 40-member school safety task force will take two or three months to 
develop a list of recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community is not only deserving of more, it is demanding more," Crosse 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Woodbury, who has formed a parents group to combat violence, told the 
board that his group would help the new panel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in a crisis mode right now in Simi Valley," he said. "We need to form a 
crisis team to address this problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Diane Collins, who will serve on the new committee, said that in 
addition to developing new safety strategies, the city and school district need 
better communication. For example, she said, she does not understand the role 
of the new police guards assigned to school campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see any control over what's going on," Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Mary Beth Wolford argued that the district has taken sufficient steps in 
response to the slaying of 14-year-old Chad Hubbard at the hands of a 
13-year-old classmate. 
</P>
<P>
 Every school is reviewing its safety plans, and district administrators 
recently met with experts from the National Safety Council to discuss ways to 
increase campus security, Wolford said.

AROUND THE VALLEY: WALLS COME TUMBLING DOWN, AND NEIGHBORS COME FACE TO FACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 There is something a little strange about the relationship between San 
Fernando Valley homeowners and their walls. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To contradict the poet: Something there is that absolutely ADORES a wall, in 
these precincts. 
</P>
<P>
 Case Study No. 1: Craig Ducette, 47, accountant, Mission Hills.  
</P>
<P>
 After five or eight or 30 seconds of what seemed interminable shaking Jan. 17, 
the second thing to cross Mr. Ducette's mind was the status of the 6-foot-high 
cinder block wall around his house. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing was I just wanted the earthquake to stop," said Mr. Ducette, 
who describes himself as a very ordinary man. "Next, I wanted to check the wall 
. . . I know it sounds a little weird now, though." 
</P>
<P>
 Only after he discovered that the wall had been reduced to rubble did Mr. 
Ducette turn his attention to the condition of his house, the whereabouts of 
his dog, and finally, to his own safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Case Study No. 2: Norman Simpkins, 74, retired, Northridge.  
</P>
<P>
 Since his wall collapsed, Mr. Simpkins, who has lived on Prairie Street for 46 
years, has taken to patrolling his home with a .270 caliber Winchester rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 Each night, Mr. Simpkins, a man with energy beyond his years, rousts himself 
from a comfortable bed at midnight for 30 minutes of guard duty. He wakes up 
again around 2:30 a.m. and stays up most of the rest of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than being a tad sleep-deprived, Mr. Simpkins, like Mr. Ducette, seems 
relatively well-adjusted -- with the notable exception of his fixation on 
getting his wall rebuilt so he can shut the world out again. 
</P>
<P>
 "People can look right in the yard and we felt very exposed," said Mr. 
Simpkins. "So we're hurrying as fast as we can to get the wall back up." 
</P>
<P>
 Ducette and Simpkins are two of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people across 
the wall-crazy Valley now ready to rebuild after their concrete barriers 
collapsed, turning neighborhood streets into a sea of broken cinder block, 
brick and stucco. 
</P>
<P>
 So for the past month or so, instead of the bleak view of the very boring and 
very orderly drab gray and rusty brown-colored walls that line the Valley's 
boulevards, people traveling slowly enough have had the chance to sneak a 
glimpse into the secret life of these very private suburbs, where dirty 
swimming pools, messy patios and unkempt lawns are the order of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't blink, or you'll miss it, because this glasnost -at-the-local-level 
is disappearing fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Sal Dominguez, 31, a North Hollywood convenience store manager who was 
recently knocking down the cinder block wall around his house with a heavy 
sledgehammer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Putting the wall back up gives me the feeling of being in control again," 
said Mr. Dominguez, opening himself up to a whole raft of psychoanalytical 
interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps my spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 Uhmmm, doc, so what is it with these walls? 
</P>
<P>
 "In some ways, people in the Valley, and West Valley in particular, represent 
pioneers moving west -- moving from places like the crowded Westside," 
theorized Santa Monica psychiatrist Mark Goulston after hearing a description 
of this love affair with cinder blocks and mortar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe there's a spirit of people moving west to stake their territory out. 
Maybe people in the Valley have more of a frontier spirit than the cosmopolitan 
spirit you would find in a city. Part of the western spirit was to have a clear 
line between your territory and the territory of others."  
</P>
<P>
 OK, that sounds reasonable. So why's it only the men? 
</P>
<P>
 "Males are more concerned with the perimeter of their property, while women 
are more concerned with the hearth, the inside of the house," Goulston said. 
"Maybe men feel that their fortresses have been violated and are now going to 
counter it by securing the walls." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the walls came down, some residents, even some of the men, have actually 
had sustained conversations with neighbors. But, take heart. No need to fear an 
outbreak of out-of-control block parties any time soon; some of the 
conversations didn't go so well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hadn't had the pleasure of meeting the folks next door in the 12 or 13 
years I've lived here," said Warren Johnson, 51, the owner of a ranch-style 
house on a now largely wall-less stretch of Superior Street in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, wouldn't you know it, the first time we met, we got into an argument 
about what material to use to rebuild the thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling now is, I don't care if I speak to him again. I mean, let's get 
this wall up already." 
</P>
<P>
 Good fences, and yes, good walls, make for good neighbors, to steal from that 
poet again. 
</P>
<P>
 To be fair, supporters of walls say they have their functions. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only are they like the three-lock front door of an urban apartment, but 
they also shut out street noise, keep wayward children out of swimming pools 
and block wandering pets. 
</P>
<P>
 But because they also divide property up so neatly, many realize that they 
have become neighbors in name only. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, after his wall collapsed, Simpkins -- the man who has been 
guarding his home with a gun -- said he had finally had the opportunity to meet 
other residents of his block. 
</P>
<P>
 "My neighbor behind me, we always kind of stared at each other," Simpkins said 
of a neighbor of 16 years. "But I had to go over there so we could decide what 
to do about a fence. It was the first time I had really talked to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "And across the street is a psychiatrist," Simpkins added. "He's a very nice 
man too." 
</P>
<P>
 So is he going to build a wall anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this time we'll put up a fence," he said. "Maybe a chain-link fence." 
</P>
<P>
 The winds of change blow soft.

SIMI SEX EDUCATION CLASSES TO INCLUDE LESSONS ON BIRTH CONTROL; SCHOOLS: SOME 
PARENTS FEAR STUDENTS WILL GET MIXED MESSAGES. BUT THE BOARD SAYS THE PLAN 
BOLSTERS INSTRUCTION ON ABSTINENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the objections of some parents, the Simi Valley school board Wednesday 
unanimously adopted a plan to add birth control information to sex education 
classes in the seventh and 10th grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some parents worried that discussing birth control would send 
students a mixed message, the board agreed in a 5-0 vote that the plan 
adequately beefs up lessons about sexual abstinence. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members Judy Barry and Doug Crosse at earlier meetings expressed 
opposition to the plan. The two decided to go along because of a few wording 
changes that they said made abstinence the most important lesson students will 
learn. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time in a long time the board has really come together in 
making a tough decision, and it took a little bit of giving on everyone's 
part," Barry said after the meeting. "Everyone came out a winner." 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining three board members agreed to the changes, which they said 
simply clarified the intent of the plan developed by a 25-member committee of 
teachers, parents, administrators and nurses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the same things," board member Diane Collins said. "This meets the 
mom test." 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Debbie Sandland, who initiated the debate last spring when she 
proposed adding birth control information to the curriculum, said she could 
live with the modifications. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the only difference between myself and the people that want 
abstinence only is the only word," Sandland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people on both sides of the issue said they were satisfied with the 
board's compromise, although parents who have argued against the plan for 
months said the issue wasn't totally put to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our group's concern is that the abstinence message is in outline form only, 
so the content still needs to be worked out," said Ginny Murray, one of the 
leaders of a parents group that has fought the plan. "We're just going to 
monitor it very closely." 
</P>
<P>
 Some who support giving students birth control information said the board did 
not go far enough, because teachers will not be allowed to talk about how 
various birth control devices work. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to have students do role-playing so they can learn to just say 
no," said Paige Moser, a coordinator of the Simi Valley chapter of the National 
Organization for Women. "But what happens if they say yes?" 
</P>
<P>
 During board discussion late Tuesday, board members added three words to a 
committee's recommendations saying abstinence will be stressed "as a standard." 
Another language change said students would be taught the consequences of their 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Crosse said the benefit of all the debate about sex education is 
that it has set a clear standard for teachers to follow. In the past, teachers 
have made their own decisions about what to teach, including about birth 
control, Crosse said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Crosse said he feared that formally placing birth control information in 
the curriculum is just the start of a trend toward more permissive sex 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a major concern, personally, about the foot-in-the-door aspect of 
introducing this," Crosse said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the board voted, President Carla Kurachi heard five "aye" votes in favor, 
and no one opposed. She jokingly said, "Wait a minute. Are there any 
abstentions?" 
</P>
<P>
 Opponent Gary Morrison said he was pleasantly surprised by the unanimous vote, 
because Crosse and Barry won changes in the proposal for their votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was enough power with the three (board members) that wanted it, they 
could have passed the program in its unmodified state," Morrison said. "We 
would have had to live with that." 
</P>
<P>
 The next step will be for a committee of teachers and nurses to take the 
board's direction to develop the specific program that teachers will use. Any 
materials chosen will be available for parents to review late this summer, said 
Leslie Crunelle, the district's director of secondary education. 
</P>
<P>
 Any parent will have the option of removing a child from the class, Crunelle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The birth control debate began last April, after a routine board review of the 
sex education curriculum. First-term board member Sandland called the lack of 
birth control information a major gap in students' learning. 
</P>
<P>
 To determine when and what students should learn about birth control, the 
board formed a committee, which began meeting in September. The committee's 
recommendations were issued in December. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel said students should learn basic information in a one-hour lesson 
about birth control in the seventh grade, while a wider discussion of about two 
lessons would be reserved for high school sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee also recommended strengthening the teaching of abstinence by 
giving students skills to refuse an aggressive partner, resist peer pressure 
and build their self-esteem.

COUNCIL REJECTS BUFFER ZONE FOR WETLANDS; THOUSAND OAKS: DEVELOPERS CALL 
PROPOSAL VAGUE, BUT BACKERS SAY IT IS LONG OVERDUE. MEASURE IS SENT BACK TO 
STAFF FOR REVISIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After a vitriolic six-hour debate, the Thousand Oaks City Council early 
Wednesday rejected a proposed ordinance that would have banned development 
within 50 feet of the city's wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen developers and building industry lobbyists spoke against the 
proposal, calling it vague, repetitive and discriminatory against a few 
landowners. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the speakers, however, were residents who said the ordinance was a 
long overdue step needed to protect fragile habitats that have been swallowed 
up by development. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Elois Zeanah and council member Jaime Zukowski, who were on the losing 
side of the 2-3 vote, said they were outraged by the result. 
</P>
<P>
 "This shows a tremendous lack of courage," Zeanah said. "We all know that the 
big developers, attorneys and lobbyists give heavily to the council members. 
Obviously, their money has paid off." 
</P>
<P>
 As Zeanah spoke, Councilwoman Judy Lazar shook her head, saying: "Oh, my, my!" 
Councilman Alex Fiore added: "This is pure rubbish." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Frank Schillo and Lazar said later that they had not taken money 
from developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo suggested that the proposal be sent back to city staff for wholesale 
revisions that would address the numerous questions raised during the debate. 
The council passed Schillo's motion unanimously. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the ordinance passed, it would have created a 50- to 100-foot buffer zone 
around existing wetlands and riparian lands -- the sensitive growth areas that 
surround wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance underwent months of review, both by the public and earlier this 
month at a Planning Commission meeting, where the commission voted 3 to 2 in 
favor of it. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday night's council meeting, City Planner Gregory Smith defended the 
ordinance he wrote as a pioneer measure that had been well considered. He said 
it was consistent with state and federal laws, and had been deemed by the city 
attorney to be defensible in court. 
</P>
<P>
 But several times during the meeting, he was criticized -- first by 
developers, then by council members -- for what they said was imprecise 
language in the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I read this ordinance and was somewhat disenchanted with the language," said 
Dale Ortmann, a Conejo Valley civil engineer. "I support the ideas in the 
ordinance, but it just has too many ambiguities. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to adopt an ordinance like this," he told the council, "at least 
put yourself in the position where you know what it says and you can defend 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Others were less diplomatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "This ordinance is vague, ambiguous, arbitrary, unconstitutional and unfair," 
said David DiJulio, an attorney for a landowner whose property rights would 
have been affected by the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 DiJulio also contended that the ordinance was unfair because only eight 
property owners would be affected, according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're denying the rights of people to use their land," DiJulio said. "And if 
you're really interested in the environment, why have you exempted everyone but 
these eight developers from having to live up to it?" 
</P>
<P>
 DiJulio, like several others, said he believed that the purpose of the 
proposal was not to protect wetlands, but to stem further development in 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The argument, in part, helped sway Fiore, who called the ordinance "the worst 
kind of micro-management." 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly is discriminatory," he said. "Here we have picked out eight or 
nine parcels of land that this will impact. We put a great competitive 
disadvantage to those few individuals. I can't, in good conscience, support 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 But the proposal's backers said the reason so few parcels would be affected by 
the plan was the dwindling amount of wetlands in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "The loss of significant wetlands in California has been noticed on a national 
level," said Roseann Mikos of the Ventura County Environmental Coalition. 
"You're the ones that have an opportunity to do something about this now, 
before it's too late." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Zukowski said she believed that the ordinance urgently needed to be passed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're at a critical time in our development," she said. "I'm sure there is a 
great desire to delay this, to put it off to another election season, but it's 
time -- past time -- to do this." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the developers who spoke said they agreed with the concept of wetlands 
protection. But they said the proposal would have been so restrictive, it would 
constitute a government seizure of their land. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Cohen, one of the potentially affected property owners, said he 
believed that Zeanah had engineered the ordinance to prevent him from using his 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ms. Zeanah, this is your ordinance. If you adopt it, we'll sue you," he said. 
"And I guarantee you, we'll win." 
</P>
<P>
 But Zeanah said her intentions were to protect the wetlands, not attack any 
specific development. 
</P>
<P>
 She and others at the meeting said the needs of developers should not be the 
council's primary interest. 
</P>
<P>
 One landowner who took exception to that asked for calm and reason from both 
the council and the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would urge some moderation," said Tibor Zada, who owns a parcel of land 
north of Hillcrest Drive that he said would be rendered useless by the 
ordinance. "Just as you accuse the developers of selfishness, there is such a 
thing as public selfishness as well. You are dealing with people's property, 
and you cannot simply take it away." 
</P>
<P>
 Zada's wife, Suzanne, compared the couple's situation to the myth of Sisyphus, 
in which a man is condemned to push a boulder up a hill and, when he reaches 
the top, the rock rolls down and he has to begin again. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost part of our property to a city road, and then to a large greenbelt; 
now they want to take the rest with this ordinance," she said. "I feel like 
Sisyphus. Please don't let another rock roll down on me." 
</P>
<P>
 Lazar said the three council members who voted down the ordinance decided that 
it contained too many inconsistencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone here wants to protect the environment," Lazar said. "This just 
wasn't the right way to go about it."

 Why is a frankfurter also called a wiener? It was invented in Vienna (Wien, in 
German) by Johann Georg Lahner, who hailed from Frankfurt. A Citrus Century 
</P>

 Sunkist, the nation's first agricultural cooperative to reach 100 years of 
consecutive operation, plans to spend a year celebrating. In August, it will 
help establish a park in Riverside, where California's first navel orange tree 
was planted. It's also giving out the 13 most requested citrus recipes of the

</P>
<P>
 These are definitely not your ordinary pickles -- geometrically perfect green 
rings with a texture that is somehow clean without being crunchy. They're made 
from kelp gathered by pickle-maker Jerry Westfall of Mendocino, Calif. Health 
foodies will be interested because of the minerals found in seaweed, such as 
phosphates, potash and iodine, but others may just like the science-fictional 
look. The original style ("spicy sweet") is a bread-and-butter-style pickle 
with a little garlic and mustard flavor; there are also dill and jalapeno 
varieties. Order from Pickles From the Sea, (707) 937-5570. Anybody Wanna Buy 
an Ostrich? 
</P>
<P>
 If you're in the market for ostriches, there's going to be an ostrich (and 
emu, and rhea bird) auction at the Stockton (Calif.) Livestock Exchange May 6. 
But bring your wallet. Ostrich meat is both cheaper to produce than beef and 
far leaner (down to 1% fat), so breeders are anticipating a boom, and breeding 
pairs have fetched prices in the thousands of dollars. (By the way, if you have 
an ostrich -- or an emu, or a rhea -- to sell , no problem; just bring it in by 
5 p.m. the night before.)

 The Pacific Northwest is where you'd expect to find great salmon, so you would 
assume that the smoked salmon in that part of the country must be great too. 
But Dominique Place, who established his smoked seafood company four years ago 
with Gerard Parrat, isn't so sure.The partners are smoking Atlantic salmon in 
Washington State.  
</P>
<P>
 Hmmmmmm. Isn't that a bit like bringing coal to Newcastle? "Pacific salmon is 
the greatest fish to eat fresh," says Place, "but Atlantic salmon is better for 
smoking. It's oilier and more luscious." 
</P>
<P>
 The two French chefs sell their seafood mainly to hotels, restaurants and by 
mail. Their clients include Four Seasons hotels, Morton's of Chicago 
restaurants and the Bon Marche department stores. 
</P>
<P>
 They use no chemical preservatives or additives in preparing any of the 
products, and all fish is guaranteed to be cured and smoked within 72 hours of 
the catch. "We don't have any seafood that hangs around," says Place. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides making the European-style smoked salmon and an array of other smoked 
seafood, the company also makes its own sausages. Stuffed with fresh and smoked 
salmon, chunks of shrimp and scallops, and fresh herbs and spinach, the mildly 
smoked seafood sausages are great grilled or lightly sauteed and served with a 
side of pasta. 
</P>
<P>
 The sausages are shipped frozen by second-day air and cost $32.95 for two 
pounds, plus another $12 for shipping.  
</P>
<P>
 That translates into about eight good-sized sausages at $5.50 each -- not bad 
considering the quality. KATHIE JENKINS

BEANS; TO SOAK OR NOT TO SOAK, IT'S NO LONGER A QUESTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Almost every recipe in every cookbook you've ever read says you must soak 
dried beans before you cook them. In almost every case that advice is wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Letting dried beans sit overnight in a bowl of cold water does nothing to 
improve their flavor or their texture. In fact, it does quite the opposite. 
While soaking shortens the unattended cooking time of beans somewhat, the time 
saved is marginal and there are no other labor-saving benefits. Finally, 
soaking does absolutely nothing to reduce the gas-producing properties of 
beans. 
</P>
<P>
 These may be difficult ideas to get used to, flying as they do in the face of 
everything most of us have been taught about cooking beans. One friend, an 
Arizonan, dismissed the idea out-of-hand, attributing it to my New Mexican 
background. "What do they know about beans?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But cooking unsoaked beans is not new. No less an authority than noted Mexican 
cookbook writer Diana Kennedy has advocated it for years. "If you want the 
best-flavored beans, don't soak them overnight, but start cooking in hot 
water," she says in "The Cuisines of Mexico" (Harper & Row: 1972). 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the more I asked around, the more people I found who cooked beans 
this way -- mostly, it seemed, people from Mexican or Central American families 
-- although at least one prominent New American chef and another well-known 
French chef agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, few commercial canners soak dried beans before cooking. In fact, 
in a way they don't cook the beans at all. The heat and pressure of the canning 
process (called the retort) is enough to cook -- perhaps even overcook -- the 
beans right in the can. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, I wanted to see for myself. Call it trial by frijoles.  
</P>
<P>
 First, I cooked three pots of beans: one soaked overnight, one quick-soaked 
(brought to a boil and left to sit, covered for one hour), and one simply 
covered with boiling water. To each pot I added a hunk of salt pork, some 
sliced onion and a bit of garlic. I simmered them slowly on top of the stove, 
covered. 
</P>
<P>
 The two soaked beans did cook more quickly than the unsoaked -- they were 
finished in about 1 hour and 15 minutes, as opposed to two hours. But when I 
sampled them, the extra 45 minutes paid off. The two pots of soaked beans were 
pallid compared to the unsoaked (though the long-soaked were better than the 
quick-soaked). The unsoaked beans had a noticeably deeper flavor; they were 
firmer to the bite, and they did not break up as much in cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the ultimate test. I sat down with a big bowl of the cooked unsoaked 
beans (after a little refrying with bacon and a handful of grated Monterey Jack 
cheese) and ate lunch. I waited, half expecting to blow up like a balloon (as a 
precaution, I did this test at home, alone). Nothing untoward happened. 
</P>
<P>
 That experiment was far from scientific, but after talking to a couple of 
researchers who confirmed my results, I moved on to more phone calls and other 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All of us, it seems, have our own set of folk tales about cooking beans. And 
most rules are followed simply because that's the way someone told us to do it, 
rather than as a result of any kind of testing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some people told me quite firmly that beans should never be salted before 
cooking -- that this keeps them from softening during cooking. In fact, Kennedy 
herself makes this claim. 
</P>
<P>
 So I cooked beans with salt added (1 teaspoon per pound of beans turns out to 
be about the right ratio) and without. They cooked to exactly the same degree 
of softness in almost exactly the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, though, to get the same level of saltiness in the unsalted 
batch of beans, I had to add more than twice as much salt. And even then, it 
was more a case of the broth being salty than the beans. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other people said that the type of pot in which beans are cooked is the most 
important thing -- only earthenware will do. 
</P>
<P>
 I cooked beans in three different pots -- earthenware, stainless-steel and 
unlined aluminum. There was some difference in the rate at which the beans 
soaked up water (or, probably more accurately, the pans soaked up water). The 
earthenware needed more water early but then seemed to maintain a steady level 
a little better. I could find little difference in flavor between the 
earthenware and the stainless-steel, but the unlined aluminum lent a distinctly 
metallic flavor to the beans. 
</P>
<P>
 * One chef told me he never allowed his beans to be cooked on top of the 
stove. Only by cooking them in the oven is it possible to get the slow, steady 
pace they need, he claimed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I cooked beans both on top of the stove and in the oven. With constant 
attention and a ready flame-tamer, I could manipulate the temperature well 
enough to keep the beans at a sufficiently slow simmer. But, covered, in a 
250-degree oven, the cooking was almost effortless. All I had to do was check 
every half-hour or so to make sure there was sufficient water. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect of the cover was particularly amazing. Cooking beans in one test 
without a cover took six hours. The same quantity of beans, cooked at the same 
temperature with a lid, was done in about 1 hour, 15 minutes ( without 
pre-soaking). 
</P>
<P>
 All of these tests were done with commonly available varieties -- pinto and 
white northern -- that had been purchased from stores that seem to sell a lot 
of beans. In fact, the age of the bean may be the most important factor. 
</P>
<P>
 Dried beans continue to lose moisture as they sit. With very recently picked 
beans -- say, the Scarlet Runners I pick and shell in the summer in my back 
yard -- a quick simmer is all that is necessary. (Actually they are quite good 
even raw when doused with a little olive oil, mint or basil and salt). 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, those dried flageolet beans you bought on a whim a couple 
of years ago that have been sitting in the back of the pantry ever since may be 
quite dry. In fact, with these beans, soaking may be necessary to bring the 
cooking time down to a matter of hours, rather than days. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, it was time to put the beans to the final test -- cooking them in 
recipes. What good is science, after all, if it is not in the service of 
mankind? So test we did, adapting old favorite bean recipes to this "new" way 
of cooking. The results were gratifying: In every case, the dishes were done in 
almost the same amount of time as the originals. And the textures and flavors 
of the beans were much improved. 
</P>
<P>
 Progress is great when it tastes so good.

 Beans, squash and chile are three of the basic American ingredients. I was 
going to add corn, but it just seemed to busy. My favorite thing about this 
recipe is the interplay of the sweet, soft squash and the earthy, firm beans. 
But that's just a bit too subtle to carry the dish. The addition of the red 
onion just before serving makes an amazing amount of difference -- a blaze of 
color across a subtle background.  
</P>
<P>
 PINTO BEAN AND SQUASH STEW 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound dried pinto beans Salt 1 (1/4x2-inch) slice salt pork 1/4 onion, 
chopped 2 cloves garlic, minced Pepper 4 slices bacon, cubed 1 jalapeno chile, 
seeded and minced 2 green onions, minced 1 butternut squash, peeled and cubed 1 
cup beef stock 1/2 red onion, finely diced 1/4 cup chopped cilantro 3/4 cup 
sour cream 
</P>
<P>
 Cover pinto beans and 1 teaspoon salt with 3 inches of boiling water in large 
pot. Add salt pork, onion and garlic. Cover and bake at 250 degrees until beans 
are cooked, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Season to taste with salt, if necessary, and 
pepper. Keep warm. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook bacon with jalapeno and green onions over low heat in large saute pan 
until bacon is crisp. Add squash and stock. Cover and cook until squash is just 
tender, about 1/2 hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine beans and squash and mix gently but well. Do not smash beans or 
squash. Spoon beans and squash into 6 serving bowls. Sprinkle each with red 
onion, cilantro and 2 tablespoons sour cream. Makes 6 servings.

 This bean-and-sausage recipe uses chorizo and blood sausages. It's adapted 
from "Paula Wolfert's World of Food" (Harper & Row: 1988). "The beans must cook 
al pil-pil," Wolfert writes, "which in Basque means very slowly in an 
earthenware pot, over very low heat. Purists say the good flavor of this dish 
comes from the taste of the pot. I believe the particular savor develops 
because the beans must be cooked very slowly to avoid breaking the pot, and 
thus the flavors of all the components have time to intermingle.  
</P>
<P>
 "The special spicy edge of this dish comes from the fleshy hot peppers of 
Espelette, a town in the Basque region of France. The closest equivalent taste 
that I have found is the . . . bottled chile sauce called Sriracha (a thick 
chile paste sold in Southern California in most Asian markets). If not 
available, substitute Red Devil sauce."  
</P>
<P>
 BLACK SAUSAGES WITH RED BEANS AND CHORIZO 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound small red beans or red kidney beans 3/4 pound lean salt pork 1/4 cup 
olive oil 2 medium onions, sliced 2 cloves garlic, sliced 1 pound fresh chorizo 
sausages in natural casings, or spicy Hungarian or Italian sausages, uncut 4 
carrots, scraped and cut into 1-inch chunks to equal 16 pieces 3 green Italian 
peppers (also called frying peppers), cored, seeded and cut into 1-inch squares 
to equal 24 pieces Dash sugar Salt 3/4 teaspoon chile paste, or more to taste 6 
ounces blood sausage Freshly ground pepper Red wine vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 Pick over beans, then place in colander and rinse under cool running water 
until water runs clear. 
</P>
<P>
 In pot blanch salt pork 5 minutes in boiling water, then drain and rinse. 
Slice off rind and cut into small pieces. Cut remaining salt pork into 8 
pieces. Set aside.  
</P>
<P>
 Place beans in deep saucepan with water to cover and slowly bring to boil. 
Boil 10 minutes, skimming often. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in 5-quart flame-proof casserole, 
preferably earthenware or enameled cast iron, over medium heat. Stir in onions 
and garlic. Saute until tender and translucent, about 10 minutes. Add chorizo 
and reserved salt pork and pork rind. Cook 5 minutes longer, stirring 
occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
 Add beans and liquid to casserole. Bring to boil, skim carefully, cover and 
bake at 275 degrees 2 1/2 hours. To avoid drying and breaking beans, be sure 
beans are always covered with cooking liquid. Add boiling water if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Toss carrots with 1 tablespoon oil in heavy-bottomed saucepan. Cover and cook 
over medium-high heat 3 minutes. Uncover, add green peppers, sugar and salt and 
stir over medium-high heat until carrots take on some color, 1 to 2 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 Stir carrots and green peppers into casserole. Return casserole to oven and 
cook, uncovered, until liquid is thickened, about 30 minutes. Set casserole 
aside at least 1/2 hour to allow flavors to blend. (Recipe can be prepared up 
to 1 day in advance to this point. Cool quickly and refrigerate covered.) 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 minutes before serving, remove surface fat from beans. Stir in chile 
paste. In medium skillet, heat 1 teaspoon olive oil over medium-low heat. 
Pierce blood sausage, add to skillet and crisp evenly, about 10 minutes. Remove 
from heat and drain. Cut into 8 pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Using slotted spoon, remove chorizo, salt pork, carrots and green peppers from 
beans. Cut chorizo into 8 pieces. Divide salt pork, blood sausage, chorizo, 
carrots and green peppers among individual heat-proof serving bowls. Adjust 
seasoning of beans with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon beans and sauce over. 
Bake at 375 degrees 10 to 20 minutes, or until very hot. (Mixture can also be 
baked in large serving casserole.) Serve hot with light sprinkling of remaining 
olive oil and vinegar. Makes 6 servings.

 Note: If using electric slow cooker with earthenware inset, set cooker on 
simmer (about 220 degrees) and cook about 10 hours.

 Cassoulet is not a recipe for the faint of heart -- or the short of time. 
Allow yourself two days to do this one, adapted from Richard Olney's "The 
French Menu Cookbook" (Godine: 1970), and the amount of work should be 
manageable. And rest assured, the flavors are more than worth the effort.  
</P>
<P>
 CASSOULET 
</P>
<P>
 Pan-Fried Goose 
</P>
<P>
 Bean Stew 
</P>
<P>
 2 medium onions, coarsely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 2 medium carrots, peeled and cut into short lengths 
</P>
<P>
 1 lamb shoulder, all surface fat removed, cut into large pieces but not boned 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup dry white wine 
</P>
<P>
 3 cloves garlic, peeled 
</P>
<P>
 Mixed herbs, such as dried thyme, oregano, marjoram and savory 
</P>
<P>
 1 (1-pound) can tomatoes or 3 to 4 fresh tomatoes 
</P>
<P>
 2 whole cloves garlic 
</P>
<P>
 White bread crumbs 
</P>
<P>
 Prepare Pan-Fried Goose and Bean Stew. Set aside. In 2 tablespoons fat 
rendered from Pan-Fried Goose, cook onions and carrots in heavy saute pan (just 
big enough to hold meat placed side by side) about 15 minutes, stirring 
regularly, until lightly browned. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove onions and carrots. In same pan over high heat, brown pieces of lamb, 
seasoned to taste with salt, in same fat. When browned on all sides, sprinkle 
with flour. Turn pieces over, then return vegetables to pan. When flour is 
lightly cooked, add white wine, garlic and sprinkling of herbs to taste. Scrape 
and stir with wooden spoon to loosen and dissolve browned bits. Transfer 
contents to heavy casserole. 
</P>
<P>
 Add tomatoes and enough of cooking liquid from Bean Stew to cover. Cook, 
covered, at bare simmer, either in 275-degree oven or over very low heat on 
range, 1 1/2 hours. Skimming off surface fat 2 or 3 times.  
</P>
<P>
 Pour contents of casserole into sieve or colander. Pick out pieces of meat and 
carrot and put aside. Press rest through sieve into saucepan. Bring to boil, 
reduce heat and cook at low simmer 15 minutes, skimming. 
</P>
<P>
 Rub bottom and sides of large, medium-deep earthenware oven dish with garlic 
cloves until garlic disappears. Untie pork rind from Bean Stew, cut into small 
dice and distribute over bottom of dish. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut Pan-Fried Goose into 2 pieces and place on bed of rinds. Drain beans, 
reserving liquid. Distribute about 1/3 of beans over and around pieces of 
goose. Split pig's foot from Bean Stew. Remove largest bones and cut each half 
into 3 to 4 pieces. Arrange pig's foot along with pieces of lamb and carrot, 
including carrot from Bean Stew, evenly over surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Cover everything with half of remaining beans. Distribute sausage from Bean 
Stew (cut into thick slices) and pancetta from Bean Stew (cut into squares) on 
top. Cover with remaining beans. 
</P>
<P>
 Generously sprinkle entire surface with bread crumbs. Then carefully, to 
moisten without displacing, pour over, ladle by ladle, sauce from lamb until 
liquid rises just to surface of beans. 
</P>
<P>
 Dust lightly again with bread crumbs. Sprinkle several tablespoonfuls of 
melted goose fat over surface. Bake at 450 degrees until heated through and 
bubbling. Reduce heat to 300 degrees so gentle bubbling is maintained. After 
about 20 minutes, as liquid reduces, partly by absorption and partly by 
evaporation, begin to baste surface, first with remaining lamb sauce and then, 
when lamb sauce is finished, with remaining cooking liquid from Bean Stew. 
</P>
<P>
 Baste every 20 minutes. When golden-crisp crust has formed on surface, break 
crust all over with spoon so part becomes submerged and rest is moistened by 
sauce. In principle, cassoulet should remain at least 2 hours in slow oven, and 
crust should be broken minimum of 3 times. But if basting liquids should run 
short before then, it is better to stop cooking than risk dish becoming too 
dry. Makes 14 servings.

 Sprinkle goose with herbs and salt to taste. Let stand overnight. Melt pieces 
of fat in pan with water over low heat. When nothing solid is left but 
cracklings, discard cracklings and strain off pure fat. Place goose in pan with 
fat and cook over low heat until tender. Save fat when done. White Bean Stew 
</P>
<P>
 6 ounces fresh pork rind 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound pancetta 
</P>
<P>
 1 pig's foot 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound uncooked garlic sausage (cervelat) 
</P>
<P>
 2 pounds dried white beans 
</P>
<P>
 2 medium carrots, peeled and cut into pieces 
</P>
<P>
 1 large onion, stuck with 2 cloves 
</P>
<P>
 2 cloves garlic 
</P>
<P>
 Bouquet-garni 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Place pork rind, pancetta and pig's foot in large pot and cover with cold 
water. Bring to boil. Simmer 5 minutes, drain and rinse in cold water. Roll up 
pork rind and tie with kitchen string. Pierce sausage in several places. Set 
aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Cover beans generously with cold water in large, heavy saucepan or earthenware 
casserole. Bring slowly to boil. Drain. Return beans to saucepan along with 
carrots, onion, garlic, bouquet-garni, pork rind, pancetta, sausage and pig's 
foot. Pour in enough warm water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to boil again, 
slowly. Cook at bare simmer. Do not add salt. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove sausage and pancetta after about 40 minutes. Reserve. Pig's foot and 
rind should cook with beans until beans are done, about 2 hours. Taste cooking 
liquid and season to taste with salt. Put rind and pig's foot aside with 
sausage and pancetta. Discard onion and bouquet-garni.

 Continuing our cross-cultural look at pork and beans, this is from Diana 
Kennedy's "The Art of Mexican Cooking" (Bantam: 1989). This version has a mild, 
lingering spice that is very nice.  
</P>
<P>
 PORK AND BEANS FROM MICHOACAN 
</P>
<P>
 (Frijoles Puercos, Michoacan) 
</P>
<P>
 2 ounces bacon, cut into small squares 
</P>
<P>
 About 6 ounces chorizo, skinned and crumbled 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup dried 1/2-inch flour tortilla squares 
</P>
<P>
 Frijoles de Olla, about 4 cups with broth 
</P>
<P>
 4 canned chiles largos or canned jalapenos en escabeche to taste 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 pound queso anejo, Chihuahua, Romano or Muenster cheese 
</P>
<P>
 2 ounces chicharron (fried crackling), broken into small pieces 
</P>
<P>
 Fry bacon in small skillet over low heat so fat renders out. Do not let bacon 
brown too much. Remove bacon pieces with slotted spoon. Set aside. Add crumbled 
chorizo to bacon fat. Fry gently without browning about 5 minutes. Remove 
chorizo with slotted spoon. Set aside. In same fat, fry tortilla squares until 
completely crisp. Drain on paper towels. 
</P>
<P>
 Put Frijoles de Olla in heavy, wide pan and add whole chiles, bacon and 
chorizo. Heat through gently so beans do not scorch on bottom. When beans just 
begin to bubble, add cheese and chicharron. As cheese just begins to melt, 
sprinkle top of beans with tortilla squares. Serve immediately, before squares 
become soft. Makes 6 servings.

 Add 1/2 teaspoon salt, onion and lard. Bring to simmer. Continue simmering 
until skins of beans are soft. Season to taste with salt. Continue cooking 
until beans are very soft and broth is soupy. Beans are better eaten day after 
cooking, when flavor matures. Makes about 3 1/2 cups.

 This recipe, adapted from "Jasper White's Cooking From New England" (Harper & 
Row: 1989), may well be the ultimate American baked bean, just sweet enough 
from the molasses and maple sugar . There is also a pleasantly bitter undertone 
from the black pepper and dried mustard.

 BOSTON BAKED BEANS 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound navy beans, pea beans or other small dried white beans 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound salt pork 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium onion, cut in 1/2-inch dice 
</P>
<P>
 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup tomato puree 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup mustard 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup maple sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup molasses 
</P>
<P>
 2 bay leaves 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons cider vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 Pick through beans and discard off-colored or broken ones. Rinse and drain 
beans. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove rind from half of salt pork. Cut into 1/2-inch squares. Cut other half 
into 3/4- to 1-inch-thick strips to equal 4 or 5 strips, with rind attached. 
Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Line bottom of earthenware crock or bean pot with 1/2-inch squares of salt 
pork and onion. Place beans on top. 
</P>
<P>
 Bring 1 quart water to boil in saucepan. Add garlic, tomato puree, salt, 
pepper, mustard, maple sugar, molasses, bay leaves and vinegar. Simmer 1 
minute. Mix well and pour over beans. 
</P>
<P>
 Score strips of salt pork crosswise, about every inch, without cutting 
through. This prevents strips from curling while cooking. Place strips on top 
of beans and liquid. Cover pot and bake at 250 degrees 5 hours, checking 
occasionally (first at 2 hours, then every hour), to be sure liquid is just 
barely covering beans. Add more water as needed. 
</P>
<P>
 After 5 hours, remove cover of bean pot and cook 1 hour more. Remove strips of 
salt pork and stir pot before serving. Makes 6 to 8 servings.

 There is no getting around it -- beans cause flatulence. The degree to which 
different beans affect different people varies, but the truth is inescapable. 
And there seems to be little a cook can do about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether to soak beans prior to cooking or not is simply a culinary question," 
says Gregory Gray, who has been studying beans for 10 years at the U. S. 
Department of Agriculture's Western Regional Research lab in Albany, Calif. "It 
may shorten the cooking time, but other than that, there's no effect (on 
flatulence)." 
</P>
<P>
 Louis B. Rockland, who has been studying beans even longer -- first at Albany 
and now with his own research firm, Food Tech Research in Placentia, concurs. 
"There are lots of old wives' tales (about reducing flatulence) -- people use 
bicarbonate of soda, ginger, sulfur, castor oil -- a whole series of them. But 
there's no evidence that any of them -- including soaking -- work effectively." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with beans is well documented. At its root are two factors. First, 
beans are high in fiber, which most Americans don't eat much of and which can 
cause flatulence. Second, beans contain complex sugars called 
alpha-galactosides. The human body does not produce enzymes to digest these 
sugars. Mainly raffinose and stachyose, they pass through the stomach 
undigested until they reach the large intestine. There they ferment, producing 
gases -- hydrogen, carbon dioxide and -- in some people -- methane. The rest is 
faux pas.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was thought that soaking beans in cold water leached these sugars out of 
the bean. Throw away the water and you throw away the gas -- it has a simple 
appeal. Unfortunately, it isn't true. These sugars are part of what the bean 
uses for nourishment as it grows into a plant, and the bean does not part with 
them gladly.  
</P>
<P>
 "When you soak beans in cold water, the beans are actually still alive and 
their cell walls are still functional," explains Gray. "Those walls are 
designed to be a very good barrier -- to take water in, but not to let the seed 
nutrients out." 
</P>
<P>
 Gray and his colleagues developed a method for extracting most of the 
alpha-galactosides from beans. The beans are boiled for three minutes 
(effectively killing the bean and allowing the sugars to pass through the cell 
walls), then allowed to stand for two hours. That water is poured off and the 
beans are covered and soaked for another two hours. Then they're drained, 
covered and soaked another two hours before being drained and rinsed a final 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This method succeeded in ridding the beans of 90% of the troublesome sugars, 
but as you might expect, there was a side effect. "I used to do this 
blanch-soak method all the time at home and it works very nicely," Gray says. 
"The one thing people who ate dinner with us have noted is that you do lose 
some flavor." 
</P>
<P>
 What's more -- without going into details of what they measured and how -- 
suffice it to say that even with almost all of the alpha-galactosides gone, 
there wasn't a consistent marked decrease in human flatulence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We reduced the alpha-galactoside content by 90% but we haven't done anything 
to dietary fiber," says Gray, "and dietary fiber produces similar effects." 
</P>
<P>
 This casts doubt not only on this particular pre-soaking method but also on 
the effectiveness of enzyme additions, such as Beano, which supposedly supply 
the chemicals necessary to break down the problem sugars. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it seems, the surest cure for flatulence caused by beans is eating 
more beans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently, if you eat beans regularly, the microflora (which ferment the 
sugars causing gas) adjust somewhat," says Gray. "If you eat bean-and-cheese 
burritos every day, unless you have some kind of specific problem, you probably 
won't notice it at all. In cultures that routinely eat beans, you don't hear a 
lot of complaining about flatulence." RUSS PARSONS

BEANS; THE BEANING OF AMERICA

<TEXT>
<P>
 Anasazi, Appaloosa, Bayo, Black Turtle, Blue Goose, Calypso, European Soldier, 
Great Giganti, Jacob's Cattle, Jackson Wonder, Mortgage Lifter, Painted Pony, 
Pinquito, Rattlesnake, Scarlet Emperor, Snowcap, Tongues of Fire, Trout. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 You want beans? You've got 'em. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't so long ago that the only dried beans you could find were Great 
Northerns, limas and kidneys. Then, with the first rush of interest in ethnic 
cuisines, along came black beans. And cannellini. Then favas and flageolet. 
Then the dam burst. 
</P>
<P>
 These beans are startlingly beautiful, richly colored and look more like a 
collection of beautifully polished semi-precious pebbles than something you'd 
boil with bacon. 
</P>
<P>
 But do they taste as good as they look? Since most of these are beans that are 
rarely found in stores, we bought 16 varieties and cooked them as simply as 
possible (water and a little salt, covered, in a 250-degree oven). 
</P>
<P>
 Some were quite distinctive. For example, the Chestnut bean (a strain 
developed by Tom Phipps) not only looks like a chestnut -- a bright hard brown 
-- but has a little of that nut's tannic bitterness as well.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Christmas limas are another unusual bean, with a sweet, almost bready flavor 
as well as a beautiful purple and cream shell that retains most of its color in 
cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 And flageolets, one of the standard beans of French cooking, have a 
remarkable, almost fishy taste similar to green beans. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the other beans offered variations on what can only be described 
as a "beany" taste -- earthy and somewhat nutty, delicious and at the same time 
as difficult to describe as the taste of a potato. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true that a lot of these beans taste somewhat similar," says Rauch. "The 
way I like to explain it, though, is that you can't tell me that a pinto bean 
tastes like a white bean tastes like a black bean. Within that range you have a 
whole spectrum of intensity of flavor, from the mildest, like Anasazi, to the 
other end -- black beans or pintos." 
</P>
<P>
 In our tasting, the mild beans included Bayo, Imperial Cranberry, cannellini, 
Christmas lima, Swedish, New Mexico Appaloosa, Tolosana, Garboncito and 
Anasazi. The "greener"-tasting beans included Madeira, Borlotti, flageolet, Red 
Calypso and Pueblo. Finally, there are Chestnuts and Scarlet Runners, which 
have a pleasant bitter edge. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The most remarkable thing about even the mildest bean was how much flavor it 
had when compared to the beans with which most of us are familiar -- wan, dried 
out and pale. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mail-order business probably has doubled every year for the last six 
years," says Ken Rauch, who runs the Bean Bag, an Oakland store that has been 
selling beans since 1932. 
</P>
<P>
 The story is much the same at Phipps Ranch, a bean grower/mail-order house in 
little Pescadero, Calif. -- about halfway between Santa Cruz and Half Moon Bay. 
Phipps pioneered the marketing of specialty dried beans and remains one of the 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been growing and selling beans for about 12 years," says Valerie 
Phipps, who, with her husband, Tom, founded the ranch in 1969. "We started out 
very simply and we knew nothing. The only beans we knew how to grow were fava 
beans and that was because the farmers Tom had worked for had grown them. Then 
this growers' catalogue came from the East Coast that had all of these 
interesting heirloom beans. We started out getting a quarter pound of each of 
these and saw which ones grew well and which ones didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then we started collecting them from all over. We have let some go over the 
years, but we've kept the majority of what we started with and added some along 
the way. It's so neat that beans are getting to be recognized as a good food. 
People are looking forward to having beans rather than it being just poor man's 
food." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At $3 a pound from Phipps and only a little less at the Bean Bag, these are 
hardly poverty food. But many of these are beans you just won't find anywhere 
else. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nicest thing about this business is giving people a good product, 
something that's good for them, but that is also preserving the heritage of the 
beans themselves," says Phipps. "A lot of these beans were forgotten about, 
grown only in back yards or in families but never enough to make a big market. 
But these are not just a novelty item. They have a history behind them. Every 
bean has a story."

WARMTH IN WINTER: LONG-SIMMERED BEANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEV BENNETT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I want inspiration for winter meals that will satisfy me down to my 
frozen fingertips, I turn to Italy's bean dishes. These are simple, economical 
recipes, usually combining beans with a little olive oil, herbs and perhaps 
meat. They are also magical recipes that fill the kitchen with an earthy, sweet 
aroma that makes coming home a reward. 
</P>
<P>
 Look in any Italian cookbook for inspiration. There's the dish that "brings 
back memories of cold winter nights when simple food brought my family closer 
together," a delicious mixture of beans and sausage simmered in tomato sauce 
that Biba Caggiano describes in her cookbook, "Northern Italian Cooking" (Price 
Stern Sloan: 1981). 
</P>
<P>
 Who could not develop an appetite for Sienese-style bean soup that Giuliano 
Bugialli, an Italian cookbook author and teacher, sketches? It's a combination 
of cannellini beans, red onions, garlic, basil, tomatoes, cabbage, pancetta and 
thyme. "It reaches its rustic peak in Tuscany where it's served with raw red 
onion," writes Bugialli in "Classic Techniques of Italian Cooking" (Simon & 
Schuster: 1982). 
</P>
<P>
 Or how about the soup from the Modena mountains in Italy that Lynne Rossetto 
Kasper discovered when researching "The Splendid Table" (William Morrow: 1992)? 
The recipe's blend of at least seven vegetables and pinto beans is enough to 
banish the deepest chills. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately these dishes are relatively easy to make. And, although there's 
romance and no small degree of practicality to making a huge potful, they can 
also be prepared in small amounts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This sausage, mushroom and bean ragout merges several recipes into a savory 
adaptation of Italy's bean classics.  
</P>
<P>
 SAUSAGE, MUSHROOM AND BEAN RAGOUT 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup dried cannellini beans 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound coarsely chopped mushrooms (oyster, shiitake, Portobello or any 
flavorful mushroom) 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound salami or kielbasa or other dry sausage, sliced 1/4 inch thick 
</P>
<P>
 1 clove garlic clove, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1 small onion, diced 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups chicken broth 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon minced fresh sage 
</P>
<P>
 Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Soak beans overnight in water to cover by 2 inches. Drain and rinse. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in large skillet. Add mushrooms and saute 5 minutes. Remove and set 
aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Add salami, garlic and onion to skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until meat 
is browned, about 5 minutes. Add drained beans, chicken broth and sage. Bring 
to boil. Reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer until beans are tender and 
mixture is thick and soupy, 45 to 60 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Add mushrooms to mixture. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Mixture should 
have stew consistency. If there is too much liquid, remove cover and simmer 5 
minutes longer. Don't season ragout before reducing liquid. Makes 2 generous 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Note : If desired, use 1 (15-ounce) can cannellini beans. Rinse under cold 
water to remove starchy liquid. Drain. Simmer, uncovered, with chicken broth 
and sage until mixture is heated through and thickened, about 15 minutes 
instead of 45 minutes.

 DEAR SOS: While spending the summer of 1986 in Bordeaux, France, as an 
exchange student, I sampled a flat, heavy cake, called gateau Basque that was 
served warm without icing. I am getting married and would like to serve the

with melted butter and sprinkle lightly with flour. Fill each with cooled Creme 
Patissiere. Cover each with top pastry, trim edges and brush top with remaining 
egg, beaten. Bake at 300 degrees 40 minutes or until cake is golden and dough 
is done. Makes 2 cakes, or 16 servings.

ROUNDING UP THE WHISTLE-WETTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The days when you could get clean, characterful dry white wine for less than 
$2 a 750-milliliter bottle are gone, but there are still a few low-priced 
whites around that will do to quench a thirst, wet a whistle or help put down 
the halibut. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, inflation and tax increases have made that $2 wine into a $3 wine, 
and in some cases you have to buy it in double-sized 1.5-liter bottles (for 
$6).  
</P>
<P>
 I tasted through more than a dozen white table wines, most of them widely 
available generics, in that price range. I intentionally avoided trying 
Sauvignon Blanc since I feel there are some particularly good values in that 
varietal and will test that category separately soon. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no great wines in the tasting, though four could be recommended as 
tasty and merit consideration for dinner or sipping. All prices are for 
750-milliliter bottles unless otherwise noted. 
</P>
<P>
 1. 1992 Fetzer Vineyards "Premium White" ($5.88/1.5 liters): Not as great a 
wine as it once was, this nevertheless remains a good value. It is composed of 
65% French Colombard blended with Muscat, Sauvignon Blanc and Gewurztraminer. 
The aroma is fresh and the taste lively and dry, relatively crisp and fruity. 
It has a $9 suggested retail price, but I found it at most grocery stores for 
less than $6. 
</P>
<P>
 2. 1992 Parducci Wine Cellars "Vintage White" ($5.99/1.5 liters): John 
Parducci has long made a tasty white wine, and this one is similar to those of 
the past but with a trace more sweetness. Because of that it would be good for 
parties where wine will be served to people with varying tastes. It is dry 
enough for wine snobs, sweet enough for those who only sip once in a while. The 
aroma is mostly of Riesling and Gewurztraminer, but the taste is not too 
floral. Very attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 3. James Arthur Field "California White" ($5.99/1.5 liters): This wine had the 
best aroma of all, mainly leafy/melony notes of Colombard. However, the wine is 
searingly dry and lacks fruit. A good wine for people who are used to totally 
dry wine. 
</P>
<P>
 4. 1992 De Poursac, Bordeaux ($2.99): Attractive earth-chalk aroma of Bordeaux 
with a hint of olive. The wine is quite dry and clean, lacks some flavor and is 
better with seafood than alone. Found only at Trader Joe's stores in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of the remaining wines are all drinkable if you're very thirsty 
or desperate for something other than cola, but there wasn't much here to 
excite me: 
</P>
<P>
 Gallo "Chablis Blanc" ($3.50): The standard in the industry and one of the 
best-selling white wines in America. I tasted three bottlings of it: one in a 
1.5-liter bottle (fresh, clean, without much distinction); one Burgundy-shaped 
bottle (earthy, papery notes, lacking in flavor) and one Bordeaux-shaped bottle 
(fresher, but with hints of sulfur dioxide in the aroma). Gallo appears to have 
repackaged its Chablis Blanc in the Bordeaux-shaped bottle. A company spokesman 
was checking at press time. 
</P>
<P>
 Round Hill Vineyards "Premium White House" (5.88/1.5 liters): A note of oak 
makes this otherwise simple wine interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 1992 Glen Ellen Winery "Proprietor's Reserve White" ($5.99): Clean and 
fuller-bodied than some, but softer than I prefer. DAN BERGER

<TEXT>
<P>
 This quick bread, made with stone-ground cornmeal, finely chopped dried 
apples, shredded Cheddar cheese and a hint of sage, takes only minutes to 
assemble and bakes in just 25 minutes. It would make a delicious accompaniment 
to roast pork or baked ham and to all manner of fowl. APPLE-CHEESE CORN BREAD 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup yellow or white cornmeal, preferably stone-ground 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup flour 
</P>
<P>
 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon dried sage 
</P>
<P>
 1/8 teaspoon ground mace or nutmeg 
</P>
<P>
 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup very finely chopped dried apples 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/4 cups milk 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup water 
</P>
<P>
 1 large egg 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
 Place cornmeal, flour, baking powder, salt, sage, mace and cayenne in mixing 
bowl. Stir well to blend. Add 1 cup cheese and chopped apples. Toss well to 
coat with dry ingredients. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Place milk, water, egg and baking soda in separate bowl. Whisk to mix. Pour 
milk mixture into dry ingredients and stir to mix. 
</P>
<P>
 Melt butter in heavy, oven-proof 10-inch skillet (preferably cast iron) until 
hot. Pour butter into batter and stir gently until blended. Then pour batter 
back into skillet. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup cheese over top. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake at 375 degrees until wood pick inserted in center of corn bread comes out 
clean, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and cool 5 minutes. Cut into wedges 
and serve hot. Makes 8 to 10 servings.

WINE: A DRY (CHEAP) WHITE SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She asked what I'd like. I asked if she had red wine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not any more," said the flight attendant. "We used to. They took it off. I 
don't know why. I only drink red wine myself. Now there's just Chardonnay and 
White Zinfandel." 
</P>
<P>
 I ordered the Chardonnay. It came in a plastic cup. The color was vaguely 
yellowish-brown. It was oxidized. I asked her who made it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blossom Hill."  
</P>
<P>
 I winced. 
</P>
<P>
 The wine, offered in small 187-milliliter bottles by Southwest Airlines, was 
awful. And I immediately recalled the good old days in California, the days 
before Chardonnay ruined white table wine as we know it. It was a time when 
white wine was clean and dry, and wasn't all mucked up with things winemakers 
think consumers want. 
</P>
<P>
 Inexpensive dry white wine -- decent honest stuff that would sell for $3 or 
less a bottle -- will never come back, I fear. The public now seeks Chardonnay 
and winemakers cater to this demand, even though it is next to impossible to 
make it very well and still keep it cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen years ago, Chardonnay was nothing more than a dry, complex dinner wine 
that sold for $8 to $12. Today Chardonnay is, for most people, generic white 
wine. When the barkeep asks what'll ya have, the answer for most patrons is 
"Chardonnay." But people in lounges don't really want Chardonnay. They really 
want "any white wine, as long as it's sweet and so cold I can barely taste it." 
But what they say is "Chardonnay." 
</P>
<P>
 Chardonnay is an expensive grape, and expensive to make well. So rarely does a 
$5 Chardonnay contain much more than the federally mandated minimum of 75% of 
Chardonnay grape juice (and that Chardonnay percentage is usually blah). Much 
of the remaining 25% is bought on the bulk wine market. Little of it would be 
very interesting on its own, and some is actually undrinkable. In a blend, the 
negative qualities are muted, but if the result is not technically flawed, 
neither is it very tasty. 
</P>
<P>
 Demand for this kind of plonk doomed dry white wine. I remember the early 
1980s when you could still get a decent bottle of dry white. My favorites were 
Beaulieu Chablis, Fetzer Premium White, Heitz Chablis, Parducci Chablis, and my 
favorite, Wente Chablis. I paid $1.99 a bottle for them and relished their 
crisp acid and racy fruit -- not to mention the lack of oak. 
</P>
<P>
 This was tasty wine that was truly dry, didn't seek to be something it wasn't 
and went fairly well with food. 
</P>
<P>
 But dry white fell victim, oddly enough, to the surplus of Chardonnay that 
developed in 1983-84. Back then, there were 22,000 acres of Chardonnay in 
California as well as lots of Riesling, Chenin Blanc and French Colombard. 
Chardonnay sold slowly so a surplus developed. The late Bruno Benziger of Glen 
Ellen Vineyards in Sonoma County took advantage of the "wine lake" to produce a 
Chardonnay that sold for $3 a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 He could do this because there was so much bulk Chardonnay around that the 
price for it was artificially low. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To make this wine appealing to the broad-market U.S. wine buyer, Glen Ellen 
made the wine soft and slightly sweet. It caught on. 
</P>
<P>
 As this category of "Fighting Varietal" wines increased in volume and others 
entered the fray, the wine lake dried up. At the same time, the cost of all 
wine began to rise through the 1980s. First came taxation. Government-imposed 
"sin taxes" on alcoholic beverages hit wine heavily. The various taxes on wine 
today are more than $3 a case, more than triple a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1983, the cost of glass bottles nearly doubled, to $4 per case. The 
price of corks, which averaged a nickel each in 1984, rose to almost $1.50 per 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Add in other, similar, costs and suddenly we're talking about a cost of nearly 
$1 per bottle -- not including the wine inside or the cost of storing it, 
shipping it and selling it. 
</P>
<P>
 As costs rose and the consumer continued to demand $5 Chardonnay, more and 
more Chardonnay was planted. Today some 60,000 acres of Chardonnay is in the 
ground, much of it poor quality stuff growing in warm regions. 
</P>
<P>
 But bad Chardonnay grapes still sell for more than excellent Colombard grapes, 
so growers were happy to tear out other varieties to plant Chardonnay. What 
disappeared was much of that wonderful, fresh, tasty Riesling, Chenin Blanc and 
Colombard that once were the heart of California's dry white table wine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today we have lots of dull, uninteresting Chardonnays with little or no 
character and we have no Wente Chablis, no Heitz Chablis. There are few white 
table wines that are as crisp or delicate as they once were. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blossom Hill Chardonnay is just one example of how far Chardonnay has 
deteriorated.  
</P>
<P>
 In January, I tasted 20 lower-priced Chardonnays in 1.5-liter bottles bought 
off store shelves. Prices ranged from $7 to $9 a bottle. I liked none of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three were even drinkable -- 1992 M.G. Vallejo Winery "Harvest Select," 
1992 Cook's American "Captain's Reserve," and 1990 Monte Verde "Classic 
Reserve." There was nothing exciting here, just white wine that wasn't 
terrible, but not much reminiscent of Chardonnay either. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the others were too sweet, marred by extraneous flavors or coarse. 
</P>
<P>
 Some wines showed the character of grapes other than Chardonnay (1992 Emerald 
Bay and nonvintage Cribari were like Riesling; nonvintage Blossom Hill was like 
Chenin Blanc). A couple of wines were oxidized (1992 Paul Masson, 1991 
Delicato). 
</P>
<P>
 Fie on cheap Chardonnay. Bring back clean, dry white.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: BEVERLY HILLS COD II 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coley's Kitchen, on Crenshaw, is a brightly decorated family place -- art on 
the walls and groovy music in the air -- that pulses with the dance-hall beat 
of Leimert Park. Sometimes it seems as if the restaurant is a direct expression 
of the community, Caribbean cooking in an African-American context, and things 
like the crisp, green-filled turnovers called patties and the strongly flavored 
saute of akee and salt fish are wonderful, first-class. It's probably the best 
sit-down Jamaican restaurant in Los Angeles, and it's usually packed -- with 
politicians, with college kids, with guys in cool knit hats. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Coley's Kitchen in Beverly Hills has a different vibe -- it may be the 
closest thing in the Southland to the dining room in a fancy Jamaican resort, 
all bright colors and rum drinks, waiters in Hawaiian shirts and customers in 
sports coats, and rustic, thatched accouterments toned down in an airy, 
expensive-decorator sort of way: "Lik Yu Finga," a crudely painted wooden sign 
says in patois. Toward the front of the place, a keyboard player coaxes a 
realistic Trinidadian steel-drum sound from his synthesizer, then segues back 
to reggae. Where the Crenshaw place is sort of funky, the Beverly Hills Coley's 
is uptown. It may be a better restaurant for taking a hot date, but despite 
similar preparations and a nearly identical menu, it's just not quite the same. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say there's nothing good here: The meaty braised oxtails are 
terrific, subtly spiced, meltingly tender, the very essence of beef. 
Long-braised short ribs are delicious, the kind of thing your Aunt Sadie might 
make if someone forced her at gunpoint to throw a handful of spices into her 
Sunday-night pot dinner. Salt cod, cooked, shredded and sauteed with onions and 
tomatoes, is delicious, if pungent enough to wake the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 But, for example, where the relatively fatty kingfish takes well to being 
pickled in Coley's oniony escovitch , the low-fat Beverly Hills-friendly 
halibut becomes dry and mealy. Curried goat is way too chewy in its hotly 
peppered sauce; salt fish with akee, a Caribbean vegetable that looks a little 
like scrambled eggs, spectacular at the other Coley's, is pretty good here but 
somehow lacks the peppery punch, the freshness that pushes this dish over the 
edge. And it's probably best to avoid chicken -- including the wan chicken 
curry and the allspice-scented jerk chicken -- because it has the flabbiness of 
reheated bird. It seems as if the cooks are still adjusting to the pressures of 
a larger restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 You do get a lot of food, though: a basket of sweet, sort of doughnut-like 
Jamaican fry bread; a couple of fried plantains; a careful mound of rice cooked 
with beans; a pile of steamed cabbage, a bowl of soup. (Try the vegetable soup, 
which is like a good minestrone sent on a Caribbean cruise.) The patties are 
good, flaky and filled with well-spiced mixtures of greens, ground beef or 
ground chicken, though they are better when they come fresh from the oven. The 
house-made Jamaican juices include thick Irish moss (it's made from seaweed, 
but mostly tastes of exotic spice), and ginger beer hot enough to pack a 
wasabi-style burn. This is pretty much as authentic a Jamaican place as you 
could ever hope to find on the Westside . . . and, unlike at island resorts, 
you don't have to endure the inevitable grouper meuniere.

STONE CRABS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stone crabs are in season from mid-October to mid-May, and only the claws are 
harvested. Since they are highly perishable, they are quickly boiled and 
chilled. Because of the thickness of the shell, the claws are usually sold with 
the shells cracked or removed. 
</P>
<P>
 If crab claws are not available for the following recipe, try the salad with 
jumbo shrimp instead. Either way, this dish is enhanced by the recipe for Joe's 
mustard sauce from Joe's Stone Crab Restaurant in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 The recipe for the mustard sauce is adapted from "Eat at Joe's", a collection 
of recipes from Joe's Stone Crab Restaurant, written by Jo Ann Bass and Richard 
Sax.

NO SUGAR FOR THE SWEETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE LAND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My friend Lois has the right idea: when in doubt, sweet potatoes. Simply 
roasted in the skins, they appear on her table throughout the winter with a 
frequency that suggests old-time Southern roots, though she was born in New 
Jersey. The leftovers are eaten cold, diced into chicken soup, added at the 
last minute to stir-fries or hashed brown with onions in a bit of olive oil. 
</P>
<P>
 What they are not is sweetened further, unless we're making pie. There's 
something about a sweet potato -- can sugar be a magnet for its own kind? -- 
that makes people want to season it with more of the same: from maple syrup to 
marshmallows, the list of dessert-oriented adjuncts is huge. The extra sugar is 
unnecessary and largely to blame, in my opinion, for the gross underutilization 
of this delicious and healthful vegetable -- think of all that Vitamin A. It's 
also an excellent source of Vitamin C. 
</P>
<P>
 Though their distinctive flavor and low starch content make them somewhat less 
versatile then white potatoes, sweet potatoes need not be confined to the 
plain-baked routine. They're delicious steamed or braised with broth and are 
equally good, if more fattening, when sauteed in butter or bacon fat. 
Deep-frying is tricky, since only the starchiest types get crisp, but there is 
no more splendid potato chip than a sweet one. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sweet potatoes take well to strong, aromatic herbs such as cilantro, rosemary 
and thyme, and they are nicely complemented by white wine, cider, lemon and 
orange juice. Partnership with smoked pork is traditional for good reason, and 
sweet potatoes are excellent foils for other assertive flavors: hot peppers, 
aged Cheddar cheese, garlic, balsamic vinegar. All these work in contrast to 
the sugar, making the finished product taste much livelier than the one-note 
preparations that simply repeat the sweet. SELECTION AND STORAGE 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of varieties of sweet potato are grown. The skins may be yellow, tan or 
magenta-brown, and the flesh color varies from just off-white to an orange so 
deep it's almost red. By the time they get to the market, however, their 
identities have been merged into two broad categories: the Puerto Rico, which 
is orange-fleshed, very sweet, dense and moist, and the New Jersey, which is 
paler, starchier and considerably less sugary. 
</P>
<P>
 Puerto Ricos are often called yams, although they aren't any such thing. More 
importantly, they aren't potatoes, either. All sweet potatoes are part of the 
Ipomoea family, cousins to the morning glory. Yams (members of the genus 
Dioscorea ) are gigantic tropical tubers seldom seen in U. S. markets; and true 
potatoes, of course, are part of still another family, the huge Solanum group, 
relatives of tomatoes, peppers and eggplant. White potatoes and sweet potatoes 
are both underground tubers, but that's about all they have in common. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweet potato tubers come in different shapes, from round to torpedo-like to 
very long and thin, with torpedoes by far the most commonly sold. Size does not 
affect flavor, though very large sweets may be somewhat woody, and very thin 
ones have a large proportion of skin to flesh. Choose sweet potatoes of even 
thickness to ensure even cooking, and look them over carefully to be sure there 
are no bruises, soft spots or mold. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike white potatoes, sweets have a very high moisture content and do not 
store well. Keep them in a dry place, out of strong light, ideally at about 55 
degrees. Higher temperatures shorten storage life; so, regrettably, does 
refrigeration. Buy sweet potatoes as you need them and use them as soon as 
possible. Do not store in plastic food bags, which trap moisture and hasten 
spoilage. 
</P>

 This festive winter side dish is a real candy-colored tangerine flake baby, 
swirls of deep magenta on a bright-orange background. Eye-catching, to say the 
least, and just as tasty as it is visually arresting. Practical, too; the whole 
thing can be prepared several hours in advance and simply heated at dinner 
time.  
</P>
<P>
 BEETS AND SWEETS 
</P>
<P>
 2 large or 3 medium beets, about 1 1/4 pounds 
</P>
<P>
 3 large Puerto Rico-type sweet potatoes, about 2 pounds 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons butter, at room temperature, plus butter for pan 
</P>
<P>
 Zest 1 small orange, about 1 tablespoon grated 
</P>
<P>
 1 (1 1/2x1/2-inch) piece peeled fresh ginger, about 1 heaping tablespoon 
grated 
</P>
<P>
 1 large clove garlic 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 Scrub beets but do not trim off straggly roots. Place beets in shallow pan and 
bake at 375 degrees 30 minutes. Add sweet potatoes and bake 1 hour longer, or 
until all vegetables are very tender when pierced with knifepoint. Remove from 
oven and let cool until comfortable to handle. (Cooking may be done 1 day in 
advance.) 
</P>
<P>
 Put 2 tablespoons butter in bowl of food processor fitted with metal blade. 
Position grater over bowl and grate in orange zest, using 1/8-inch holes to get 
shreds instead of crumbles. Using same holes, grate in ginger, then garlic. 
</P>
<P>
 Peel cooled sweet potatoes, cut into chunks and add to processor with salt. 
Process just long enough to puree potatoes and incorporate seasonings. 
</P>
<P>
 Spread sweet potato puree in buttered shallow 1-quart casserole or gratin pan. 
Peel cooled beets, cut into chunks and process in unwashed processor bowl until 
beets are finely chopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Spread beets over sweet potatoes, then fold and swirl with spatula to streak 
colors. Do not overmix (only few strokes needed to get effect). 
</P>
<P>
 Cover pan with foil and bake at 350 degrees until heated through, 20 to 35 
minutes. Makes 4 to 6 servings.

MOTHER SAYS EAT YOUR OATMEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY CARROLL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jump-starting the body for the day means a stop at the breakfast table. 
Research has shown that Mom was right: Breakfast is an important meal. Kids who 
eat breakfast do better in school, and adults are less likely to snack or feel 
the mid-morning slump when they eat something before leaving for work. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, many of us skip breakfast or get our morning "nutrition" via 10 
o'clock doughnuts or the local drive-thru fast-foods window. 
</P>
<P>
 I've found the easiest way to fit in a healthy breakfast at home is to prepare 
it the night before. For instance, for oatmeal mornings in mid-winter, I set up 
my bowlful the night before, measuring out dry old-fashioned oats, a little 
cinnamon, some chopped dried fruit. In the morning, I add boiling water, 
microwave on HIGH (100% power) for several minutes and enjoy with maple syrup. 
Low-stress, low-fat -- it's a fast breakfast that stays with me for most of the 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 A busy friend with kids uses her old-fashioned metal Thermos in the same way. 
Hot cereal fixings and boiling water go into the Thermos the evening before; 
she wraps the Thermos in several dish towels and leaves it on the counter 
overnight. In the morning, she has instant hot cereal that the kids can help 
themselves to. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On mornings when I have a little more time to cook, I make pancakes or 
waffles. This doesn't mean mixing the batter with still-closed eyes; actually 
it's whipped together the night before when I'm alert. Most pancake and waffle 
batters can be buzzed in the blender until smooth, then refrigerated overnight. 
The next morning, preheat the griddle or waffle iron and pour out what you need 
for a simple breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagels are another low-fat, dine-and-dash breakfast, but the wrong toppings 
can send your meal off the top of the fat charts. I stock the refrigerator with 
homemade low-fat spreads, like part-skim ricotta cheese pureed with chopped 
dates. Sliced apples or a sprinkle of raisins on top make it a perfect 
five-minute breakfast.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Keep the instructions for this microwave oatmeal taped to your refrigerator 
door for easy morning access.  
</P>
<P>
 MICROWAVE OATMEAL 
</P>
<P>
 2/3 cup old-fashioned rolled oats 
</P>
<P>
 1 to 2 tablespoons minced dried apple, optional 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons raisins 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup cranberry-apple juice or water 
</P>
<P>
 Maple syrup 
</P>
<P>
 Divide oats, apple, raisins, cinnamon and salt between 2 small microwave-safe 
cereal bowls. Stir well. Add juice. Microwave on MEDIUM (50% power) until 
oatmeal has absorbed all liquid, 5 to 6 minutes. Serve with maple syrup. Makes 
2 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The variations on this delicious spread are endless -- and it keeps a week in 
the refrigerator.  
</P>
<P>
 SWEET RICOTTA BAGEL SPREAD 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup light ricotta cheese 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons finely chopped pitted dates 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon honey, or to taste 
</P>
<P>
 Combine ricotta cheese, dates and honey in small bowl, mixing well, or puree 
in blender. Refrigerate in covered container about 1 week. Makes 1/2 cup. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To make fluffier pancakes, mix dry and wet ingredients in separate containers, 
then combine right before serving.  
</P>
<P>
 OVERNIGHT CINNAMON-FRUIT WAFFLE BATTER 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups unbleached white or whole-wheat pastry flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons honey, brown sugar or maple syrup 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups low-fat buttermilk or nonfat milk 
</P>
<P>
 1 large egg 
</P>
<P>
 2 egg whites, lightly beaten 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon canola oil 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons chopped dried fruit, such as apricots, blueberries or peaches 
</P>
<P>
 Unsweetened applesauce as topping 
</P>
<P>
 Combine flour, baking powder, salt, baking soda and cinnamon in large 
container. 
</P>
<P>
 Process honey, buttermilk, egg, egg whites and oil in blender until thoroughly 
blended, 1 minute. Stir in dried fruit. Add dry ingredients and mix well. Cap 
blender jar tightly and refrigerate overnight, if not using immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Preheat griddle or waffle iron. Lightly spray surface with non-stick vegetable 
spray. Pour batter onto griddle by 1/4-cup measures for pancakes or fill waffle 
iron 2/3 full. Cook pancakes until bubbles appear on 1 side, then turn and cook 
2 to 3 minutes. Cook waffles 5 to 6 minutes, or according to manufacturer's 
instructions. Top with applesauce and serve immediately. Makes 6 servings.

LAZY FISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE LEVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A favorite formula among French chefs for obtaining moist, succulent fish 
happens to be an easy, low-fat cooking method. It requires only five 
ingredients besides the fish: fish stock, wine, shallots, salt and pepper. The 
fish and seasonings are placed in a baking dish, covered and baked in a hot 
oven. You don't even have to turn the fish over during cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 (You can buy frozen fish stock at fish markets and fine supermarkets; if you 
don't have fish stock, use canned vegetable broth.) 
</P>
<P>
 Chefs call this technique "braising," but it could more precisely be described 
as moist baking. The dry, uniform heat of the oven cooks the fish evenly, yet 
less fat is needed than for roasting or dry baking. A small amount of liquid 
prevents the fish from drying out. Much less liquid is used than in poaching, 
so the fish keeps its natural taste and the liquid itself acquires a good, 
concentrated flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The usual flavoring for the cooking liquid is minced shallot, but you can 
substitute garlic or green onions. Or place a few sprigs of fresh thyme or 
tarragon in the baking dish. And quick-cooking vegetables -- such as mushrooms, 
tomatoes and thin strips of leek -- enhance the taste of the sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 To turn the cooking liquid into a sauce, boil the liquid to reduce it and 
enrich it with cream or butter, or add it to a separately prepared sauce. For 
quick meals skip the reducing step and simply add a few tablespoons of the 
liquid to a quick vinaigrette or tomato sauce. An even faster idea is to use 
the liquid as is, served on a bed of rice, couscous or orzo with the fish. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Freeze any fish cooking liquid left from this recipe, and use whenever you 
need fish stock. Parchment paper is best for covering the fish during baking -- 
it permits some steam to escape so the liquid begins to reduce but keeps some 
steam in so the fish will not be dry.  
</P>
<P>
 BASIC MOIST-BAKED FISH 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 pounds fish of choice, steaks or fillets, about 1 inch thick 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon minced shallot 
</P>
<P>
 Oil or butter 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons dry white wine 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 to 2/3 cup Fish Stock, fresh or thawed frozen or canned vegetable broth 
</P>
<P>
 If using fillets, remove bones with tweezers or paring knife. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprinkle shallot in oiled 10-cup oval gratin or heavy shallow baking dish. 
Arrange fish pieces in dish in 1 layer. Pour wine over top. Lightly season to 
taste with salt and pepper. Bring 1/2 cup stock to simmer in small saucepan and 
pour over fish. If liquid doesn't cover base of baking dish, add more stock. 
Set oiled parchment paper or foil cut to size of dish directly on fish. Bake at 
425 degrees about 10 minutes. When tested with fork at thickest point, fish 
should be opaque and just flake. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove fish to platter, reserving cooking liquid. Cover fish with oiled paper 
and keep warm. If desired, strain cooking liquid before using as sauce or 
adding to sauce. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Note : To make quick sauce, bring cooking liquid to boil in small saucepan. 
Add 2 tablespoons butter. Whisk over low heat just until blended. Remove from 
heat. Add 2 teaspoons chopped fresh herbs. Fish Stock 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 pounds fish bones, tails and heads of non-oily fish or 1 pound fish 
pieces for chowder 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon oil or butter 
</P>
<P>
 1 onion, sliced 
</P>
<P>
 5 cups water 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme 
</P>
<P>
 1 bay leaf 
</P>
<P>
 Rinse fish bones under cold running water 5 minutes. Then drain. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in heavy, large saucepan over low heat. Add onion. Cook, stirring 
often, until tender, about 10 minutes. Add fish bones, water just to cover, 
thyme and bay leaf. Bring to boil, skimming surface occasionally. Reduce heat 
and simmer, uncovered, 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Strain stock. If not using within 1 day, freeze. Makes about 1 quart.

HOME COOK: IMPROVING A CLASSIC: ULTIMATE UPSIDE-DOWN CAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARION CUNNINGHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My mother had only one cookbook all the years I lived at home. It was a slim 
volume titled "Any One Can Bake," written in 1937 and compiled by the 
Educational Department of the Royal Baking Powder Co. There were photographs of 
how to do the basic steps of each recipe and charming, mouth-watering drawings 
of cakes and cookies in color. To the best of my memory, my mother only baked 
one cake from the book: pineapple upside-down cake. I loved that cake. It was 
gooey, sweet and beautiful -- and I never grew tired of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years I have made many pineapple upside-down cakes, but I have never 
tried the one from my mother's baking book until now. Sadly, it wasn't the cake 
I remember. It was too sweet and too gooey, which tells you that you can't go 
home again through recipes. 
</P>
<P>
 The recipe I've got here, however, is my idea of a perfect pineapple 
upside-down cake. I changed the topping to make it creamier and cut the 
pineapple slices in half, placing them in a circle around the edge of the pan 
so they are almost touching. I put a maraschino cherry into the half circle of 
each slice of pineapple and placed a whole slice -- with a cherry -- in the 
middle of the pan. This allows everyone a slice of cake with pineapple and a 
cherry. 
</P>
<P>
 A nice prelude to the pineapple upside-down cake is Lone Star chicken. It is 
another recipe that seems ordinary but cooks outstandingly. You can serve it 
hot or cold, and it's a breeze to put together. It yields extra sauce that 
freezes well and is a good sauce over pasta. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You need to use a 10-inch skillet, 2 inches deep, or a cake or pie pan, and 
they need to have a 2-quart capacity. It's also a good idea to put a baking 
sheet under the pan or skillet to catch any juices that might bubble over the 
edge of the pan.  
</P>
<P>
 PINEAPPLE UPSIDE-DOWN CAKE 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup butter, cut into 4 pieces 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup light-brown sugar, packed 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
 7 whole slices canned pineapple, 6 cut in half 
</P>
<P>
 13 maraschino cherries 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup shortening 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1 egg 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons vanilla 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup all-purpose flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup milk 
</P>
<P>
 Sweetened whipped cream, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Combine butter, brown sugar and heavy cream in 10-inch, 2-quart skillet or in 
small saucepan if using pie or cake pan to bake. Heat skillet or pan over low 
heat and stir until mixture is smooth and butter has completely melted, 1 to 2 
minutes. If using pie or cake pan, pour sauce into pan and cool slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Place half slices of pineapple, lengthwise, almost touching, around edge of 
pan or skillet and place whole slice in center. Fill each half and whole slice 
with maraschino cherry. 
</P>
<P>
 In large mixing bowl, beat shortening and sugar, using back of large spoon to 
press and smooth shortening and sugar together until well mixed. Add egg and 
vanilla and vigorously stir mixture until creamy and well mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine flour, baking powder and salt. Add to shortening mixture. Stir 
vigorously to blend and smooth lumps. Add milk all at once and stir until 
batter is smooth and creamy. 
</P>
<P>
 Using spatula, spread batter over pineapple topping and gently spread to 
edges. Remember that batter, which becomes cake, will be on bottom and 
pineapple mixture will be on top when you finish baking and turn cake upside 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake at 350 degrees about 30 minutes, or until top of cake is golden. Remove 
cake from oven and cool 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 To remove cake from pan, put plate that is larger than cake on top of skillet 
or pan and quickly turn skillet upside-down, so cake lands on plate with 
pineapple slices on top. Serve with slightly sweetened whipped cream. Makes 8 
servings.

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: VOLUNTEER FINDS SHE HAS LOTS OF COMPANY

 There are days when time seems to swallow us whole. With work and family 
demands gobbling up each weekday and domestic chores making quick work of 
weekends, there is hardly enough time left to catch our collective breath, let 
alone socialize, exercise or think about others. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, many of us have to admit that if we organized our time better, we 
would have more of it. And then we might be able to devote some of it to 
helping those for whom time is a dark and bleak space filled with homelessness, 
hunger or illness. 
</P>
<P>
 So how do we go about sharing our time? Who is the most needy? And what do 
they need most? 
</P>
<P>
 These are some of the questions free-lance writer Rachel Altman, the author of 
this week's cover story, asked herself when she decided it was her time to 
become a volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what stops a lot of us from volunteering is that we think it is going 
to be depressing to face all these things like illness, poverty and death," she 
said. "In fact, what I found was the opposite, that the people I met were 
energized by the process of getting involved in their communities."

 In the course of reporting her story, Altman talked to volunteers and 
coordinators who work with communities in need as well as people in need. She 
found folks all around our county shelving books in libraries, teaching adults 
to read, serving in hospices, stuffing envelopes and driving patients to the 
doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Volunteer coordinators all expressed a great need for any kind of help they 
can get from people," she said. "In most cases, need is expanding and money to 
provide services is shrinking and that's where volunteers come in." 
</P>
<P>
 Doing this story, Altman said, helped her see that getting involved in her 
community didn't need to be as taxing or complicated as she worried it would 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I went with the photographer back to one of the centers, I met a 
volunteer who was serving food. She was cheerful and really seemed to enjoy the 
work," said Altman. "At one point she looked at me and said, 'I'll tell you why 
I come here. It feels very nice to put food in someone else's stomach. It is 
very direct. It is very simple. It is no big deal. It's just food.' "

 Elsewhere in the section, a group of defense contractors met in Oxnard to get 
some recycling help from a national expert. What were they recycling? 
Themselves. More in the Earthwatch column.

THEATER REVIEW; PERFORMANCES, DRAMA MAKE 'PRICE' RIGHT ON; THE 1968 COMEDY AT 
THE SANTA PAULA THEATER CENTER CONCLUDES THE AD-HOC ARTHUR MILLER FESTIVAL IN 
VENTURA COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Two middle-aged brothers, estranged for many years, are brought together when 
one arranges for the sale of their late parents' furniture. The purchasing 
agent is a 90-year-old appraiser and dealer -- and, it appears, a consummate 
con artist. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the plot of "The Price," the 1968 play that, in a Santa Paula Theater 
Center production, concludes an ad-hoc Arthur Miller Festival that's been 
taking place in Ventura County for the past month or so. Unlike "A View From 
the Bridge" (which ends Saturday at the Conejo Players' Theater) or "The 
Crucible" (performed, also in Thousand Oaks, by the Young Artists' Ensemble), 
this is a comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 But "The Price" is an Arthur Miller comedy, which means that there's lots of 
Deep Inner Meaning, not to mention dramatic confrontations aplenty and more 
than a little speechifyin'. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Franz is a career cop who, never having risen above the rank of 
sergeant, is fighting his wife's attempt to urge him into a retirement that, 
she hopes, they can enjoy together. Comfortable in his routine job, he is 
afraid of an uncertain future. He also resents his brother Walter, a successful 
physician whose investments have added to his wealth and social status. 
</P>
<P>
 It's strong drama -- Miller's attempt at '60s language and notions sound more 
like a decade or two earlier, which is appropriate in light of the characters' 
age -- as the two brothers do their figurative dance under the assured 
direction of Gerald Castillo. 
</P>
<P>
 SPTC Artistic Director David Ralphe stars as the bullheaded and suspicious 
Victor, as much a blue-collar prototype as was Archie Bunker of the TV series 
"All in the Family." Linda Livingston plays his wife, Esther, longing for just 
a bit of the good life after all these years, a reward that will be made 
possible by the revenue from the furniture sale plus Victor's pension. And 
Braden McKinley is seen as polished, professional brother Walter. 
</P>
<P>
 Stimulating the interaction -- and all but walking away with the play in a 
richly comic performance -- is veteran local actor Robert E. (Doc) Reynolds as 
Gregory Solomon, a Russian Jewish emigre who is asked to make an offer on the 
furniture. While wise old Solomon assesses the value of the treasure and 
detritus of many decades past, he causes the others to re-evaluate the toll -- 
the "price" -- that life has extracted from them. 
</P>
<P>
 The series of reflections and confrontations take place in a detail-laden 
top-floor apartment designed by Jeff Garcia and lit by Robin Shirley. And 
somebody made a commendable effort to track down vintage recordings called for 
in the play. 
</P>
<P>
 A note of praise, too, for the Theater Center's new printed program design, 
with copious notes on the play and production as well as news of upcoming 
events. Credited to theater manager Rose Blackburn and with contributions by 
the production staff and cast, it's far and away the best in Ventura County.

NIGHT LIFE: STILL BLASTING AWAY; AFTER 15 YEARS AND SURVIVING THE HEYDAY OF 
PUNK, THE BLASTERS REMAIN MASTERS OF THE RETRO ROCK, COUNTRY, BE-BOP, SWING AND 
BLUES MIX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If you've never seen the Blasters, you've never rocked. That's how simple this 
is. It'll be plenty warm at the Ventura Theatre Friday night when the Blasters 
tear it up with their upbeat American music. Raging Arb and the Chance Brothers 
will open this all-ages show. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15 years ago, the Blasters came blasting out of Downey with a 
sweat-inducing mix of retro rock, country, be-bop, swing, blues and about 
everything else. The original lineup consisted of singer Phil Alvin, songwriter 
and guitarist Dave Alvin, Johnny Bazz on bass and Bill Bateman on drums. Piano 
player Gene Taylor joined soon after. The Blasters released a 
hard-to-find-these-days debut album on a garage label, then put out a series of 
critically acclaimed records on Slash. The band, it seems, has always been on 
the verge of becoming the Next Big Thang. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Alvin, in a lengthy interview, left scant room for witty exposition. So 
here goes: 
</P>
<P>
 How often do the Blasters play these days? 
</P>
<P>
 What do you mean these days? Actually, we play quite frequently -- maybe 12 
times a month. And I'm happy to do it. The Blasters never really stopped 
playing, you know. Right now, I'm working on two albums -- a solo album and 
another Blasters album. They'll be on the CBS Sony something label. 
</P>
<P>
 Your family has some Ventura roots? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, my uncle used to live up there off Ventura Avenue on Lewis Street. He 
fought in World War I, so he's gone now, but his son, Porky Smith, who was the 
baddest dude in Ventura, still lives there. 
</P>
<P>
 Who's in the band? 
</P>
<P>
 James Intveld is on guitar. He replaced Greg Hormel who replaced Hollywood 
Fats who replaced my brother, Dave Alvin. He's been in the band since last 
year, and this guy can play guitar, man. Some fools had him playing bass behind 
other guys who couldn't play the guitar or the bass. Johnny Bazz is still on 
bass. Dave Carroll is the drummer. Bill Bateman couldn't decide whether he 
wanted to be in the Blasters or the Red Devils. Finally, I had to give him a 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened to Gene Taylor? 
</P>
<P>
 He moved to Toronto for a while. Now I think he's in Austin doing some stuff 
with the Thunderbirds. 
</P>
<P>
 When's the last time your brother played with the Blasters? 
</P>
<P>
 A little more than a year ago, I think. We played a benefit for Barbara Boxer 
and Dave played with X and the Blasters. Man, we tore it up that night. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's up with Lee Allen? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Lee, whom I've known since I was about 14 years old, is still with us, 
but his doctors told him to take it easy for a while because of high blood 
pressure. That guy's amazing. He'd put everybody to bed about 5 in the morning; 
take the bottle with him, then wake everybody up a few hours later, all dressed 
up and ready to go. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so it was five Blasters, plus Steve Berlin and Lee Allen on sax. How come 
you guys ain't rich? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, my brother, who I love dearly, didn't know about the music business -- I 
taught business mathematics on a university level and I know what I'm talking 
about. He's a great and skilled musician, but he knows nothing about 
negotiations. Nobody really went broke or anything, but it's a fallacy to 
assume anyone gets rich in this business unless you sell yourself away. Record 
companies are leeches that know nothing about music. If they did, they'd play. 
</P>
<P>
 What was it like being on "American Bandstand"? 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Clark was very, very kind to us. We were on three times, and he was 
totally prepared; he'd come out and tell us the history of our band. He liked 
me and let me be one of the judges on one of his other shows, a lip-sync show. 
One time, he handed us pens and let us sign this wall, which had all these 
famous rockers on it like Jerry Lee Lewis. He was very cool to us. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blasters are often described as a roots band or rockabilly or a retro 
band. Do those terms hurt your band? 
</P>
<P>
 I don't like the term rockabilly , which I think is a racist term from the 
late '40s or '50s. It was used to differentiate white rock 'n' roll from "race 
music." I've heard black people play so-called country music, and I've heard 
whites play so-called blues music. Rock 'n' roll is merely poor people's music. 
"Crazy Blues" from the early '20s was one of the first examples of a recording 
by a poor person. I also don't like the term roots music. Roots are under the 
ground. Are we compared to roots? All of these things are just names. We play 
trunk music. 
</P>
<P>
 Is "Crazy Blues" harder to find than your first album? 
</P>
<P>
 It's probably easier. I recently found two of those albums in my storage. One 
of them is still sealed, but the other, I was signing it for someone, and never 
finished. It says, "To Susan," then, that's all. So if Susan is out there, I've 
got her album. I've seen them go for 300 bucks. Man, we used to give those 
things away. 
</P>
<P>
 What was it like being in the L.A. scene in 1979? 
</P>
<P>
 It was great, yeah. Playing the Starwood and all those places was right for 
us. I think that whole scene was the last event that will ever happen when the 
record companies, the music and fashion all came together. 
</P>
<P>
 How did you get started in all this? 
</P>
<P>
 I knew this guy named Ernie Franklin. I was 14 or so and we were playing the 
same kind of music we're playing now. Anyway, Ernie took us to meet his mom, 
Mary Franklin, who used to be a singer and dancer in Harlem. She introduced us 
to Big Joe Turner, T-Bone Walker and Lee Allen. Details

 Dance fans, get your motors runnin' and your boot socks dry: Ventura Western 
Days, an annual three-day weekend of country dancing, workshops and 
competitions is almost here. Best of all -- you don't have to drive to 
Bakersfield or Fresno. It's all happening at three venues in Ventura from March 
11-13. 
</P>
<P>
 Accomplished country dancers love this event. But deejay-instructor Rick 
Henderson and his J. R. Productions have something for everyone. I especially 
urge novice dancers to give this event a try. You'll have a chance to improve 
your skills, confidence, and see everything from simple line dances to 
exhibitions by champion competition couples and teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Several popular couples dances, including the waltz and West Coast swing, will 
be taught. You don't have to bring a partner to participate, but it is 
recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 And for you line dance fanatics, Henderson has added an eight-hour bonus Line 
Dance Mania Workshop to be held from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. March 12 at the Ventura 
Concert Theatre. For this new event, he's invited out-of-town guest 
instructors, in addition to some of your local favorites. And you can bet that 
they'll teach plenty of new and challenging line dances. 
</P>
<P>
 Special discount lodging is available at the Ramada Inn on Santa Clara Street 
near the American Legion Hall. Just mention you're there for Ventura Western 
Days. See ya there! 
</P>

 About three months ago, Schooner Time, a concrete-floored, no-frills sports 
bar in Simi Valley's Cloth World shopping center, began offering free line 
dance lessons and booking bands, including Platte River Crossing, on Thursday 
nights. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been going so well that the gang at Schooner Time recently swept up the 
peanut shells, installed a wooden dance floor and extended the 7 to 8 p.m. free 
lessons to Friday and Saturday. And at 8:30 p.m., you can dance to live music. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in March, the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks will change 
its format. Mondays through Thursdays, look for Happy Hour from 5 to 7 p.m. and 
dance lessons at 6, 7 and 8 p.m. The only cover charge kicks in at 7 p.m. 
Wednesdays and 8 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday will be your last chance to take advantage of the weekly West Coast 
swing night. In March, John Santangelo will be teaching Line Dance Mania on 
Mondays. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, 4 to 8 p.m. Sundays will be Family Nights, with line dance 
lessons at 4:30 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. for kids. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Fans of the popular-but-disbanded Ventura group Caught Redhanded should be 
happy to know that lead singer Troy Robinson has given up ostrich farming in 
Oklahoma and returned to Ojai. Rumors are flying that the band will be 
re-formed in some incarnation. As you may know, guitarist Jim Monahan is now 
with Desert Rose band. And Alan Flaa is playing pedal steel for Sky King. So 
what gives? Your guess is as good as mine. Stay tuned. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Phil Salazar's fabulous bluegrass group the Acousticats recently played 
Nicholby's in Ventura (you remember -- the huge upstairs club everyone says has 
so much potential). For a terrific toe-tapping time Saturday, drop by between 
9:30 p.m. and 12:30 a.m. for a rare performance by another tight-harmony 
bluegrass band, the Cache Valley Drifters from Los Olivos. In June, the band 
will headline the annual Live Oak Music Festival held near Santa Barbara. But 
thanks to Fred Schmidt, Nicholby's new stage manager, you can enjoy them in 
this great venue for only $3. Details 
</P>
<P>

workshops and competitions. 
</P>
<P>

SOUNDS: COUNTY SYMPHONY SHIFTS ITS FOCUS TO THE CONTEMPORARY; MIGUEL DEL 
AGUILA'S "TOCCATA" IS PERFORMED AT FINAL CONCERT. AND CHAMBER ENSEMBLE LAUNCHES 
'MUSICS ALIVE!' SERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If only in a short, token burst, the Ventura County Symphony descended into 
the land of the living and emerged triumphant. 
</P>
<P>
 The mortals they met there were composers Miguel del Aguila and Mel Powell. 
Aguila is a gifted composer from Oxnard by way of Uruguay, and North 
Hollywood-based Powell is the amiable modernist from CalArts by way of jazz, 
serialism and a Pulitzer Prize. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict: We should do this more often. 
</P>
<P>
 The contemporary works came in small but potent doses, leaving a certain hum 
of electricity over the local classical music scene. Del Aguila's 1988 piece 
"Toccata" opened the last official symphony subscription concert, stirring up 
the calm in the Oxnard Civic Auditorium with its concentric waves of energy and 
calculated chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 The bracing invention of del Aguila's piece paved the way for the stodgier -- 
if articulately delivered -- stuff of Brahms' Piano Concerto No. 1 and Dvorak's 
too-familiar "New World Symphony." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week at Ventura's Poinsettia Pavilion, Powell's atonal but also 
beautifully quixotic "Modules: An Intermezzo for Chamber Orchestra" highlighted 
the kickoff event of the symphony's "Musics Alive!" series. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the first of three cleverly packaged concerts combining modern music 
with that of various world traditions, and finding elements of East-West 
crossover. Subsequent concerts will be "China Alive!" at Rancho del Rey in Oak 
View on March 15 and "India Alive!" at the Spanish Hills Country Club in 
Camarillo on April 12. Seating is limited to 200 at each concert, so advance 
planning is advised. 
</P>
<P>
 The symphony's friendly, take-charge music director Boris Brott told the 
capacity crowd at the pavilion: "If there is no music of today, then we become 
a museum." 
</P>
<P>
 The mood in the room, anything but museum-like with its arrangement of tables 
in an arc around the musicians, was one of curiosity seeking and cautious 
cultural advocacy. 
</P>
<P>
 An accomplished chamber ensemble from the symphony fed 20th-Century "serious" 
music and Indonesian music to an audience not necessarily enamored of either. 
All left more or less sated. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow moderator Charles McDermott spoke in more direct, dramatic terms 
against the enemy of the moment -- the "dead white European male," that entity 
responsible for the bulk of classical repertoire that is played and heard in 
this conservative era. 
</P>
<P>
 But on this night, dead white European males were far from anyone's mind. For 
a change. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening the program, Stravinsky's humbly scaled "Eight Instrumental Miniatures 
for 15 Players" proved to be a cerebral appetizer, teeming with his 
characteristic blend of modern and primitive, academic and folk sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 A local angle: It was written in 1962 for Lawrence Morton, the music supporter 
largely responsible for giving the Ojai Festival an international reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Powell, the witty composer and teacher sat with his shock of white hair 
and a New York Yankees jacket, and discoursed easily about the conceptual basis 
of his piece. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the minute, there is the same architecture as the universal," he said, 
and, through his music, demonstrated the relationship of minute details to 
compositional superstructure. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Powell's musical language descends from the difficult realm of 
12-tone theory, he -- like Elliott Carter -- is one of that field's more 
persuasive arbiters. With "Modules," a hard-to-define Eastern sensibility came 
through in the key use of silences and coloristic sonic waves. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonal activity brushed across the ensemble in mysterious waves, accented by 
touches of percussion and keyboard filigree. The piece is relatively short, but 
leaves an indelible impression. 
</P>
<P>
 In his between-piece discussion, Brott correctly dubbed "Modules" as romantic, 
despite its avoidance of consonant tonality. "But it is not romantic in the 
sense of rhapsodic 19th-Century cliches or hummable melodic fragments. It 
speaks to the desire for transcendence and embodies an admiration for the parts 
uniting the whole." 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, the CalArts Gamelan was led by I Nyoman Wenten in a brief 
illustration of the Indonesian tradition involving rhythmically hypnotic, 
microtonally tuned gamelan orchestras of Java and Bali. This is one of the most 
reliably engaging, time-altering and timeless of world musics, regardless of 
its status or hipness in world music circles. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to indigenous works, including one with a dancer, the gamelan 
performed a piece that, of the entire program, most plainly expressed an 
East-West melding -- 85-year-old American composer Lou Harrison's piece for 
gamelan, and horn and clarinet soloists. The Western soloists sailed plaintive 
long notes over the gamelan's percolating bed of rhythm, to seductive effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Since long before the Minimalists got hold of it, Harrison has been fascinated 
by and conversant with Indonesian influences, and has devised enchanting music 
that gives cross-cultural a good name. 
</P>
<P>
 Another kind of cross-cultural bargain was struck in Darius Milhaud's 
semi-classic ballet, "La Creation du Monde," which closed the concert amiably. 
</P>
<P>
 This piece is as famous for its story as its sonorities. French composer 
Milhaud came to the United States in 1922 seeking jazz, the then-revolutionary 
new sound, and wove together jazz and symphonic influence before our beloved 
Gershwin did the same with "Rhapsody in Blue." 
</P>
<P>
 So closed a refreshingly variegated and crisply performed concert, with 
festive, bending blue notes and the spirit of a sassy jazz ensemble. Music is a 
many-shaped and colored thing, a point that the "Musics Alive!" series seems 
well-equipped to convey. Details

 The earthquake-damaged Thousand Oaks Library needs your help now. The 
children's section was destroyed by debris and water. Ten thousand books were 
damaged beyond restoration. The carpets were ruined. The phone system and 
computers must be replaced or repaired. Early estimates indicate the 
restoration will cost $2 million. The rebuilding has already begun. Friends of 
the Library invite you to bring children to the Hard Hat Art event at 1 p.m. 
Saturday, March 5, at the library, 1401 Janss Road. Everyone can create a 
masterpiece on the bare cement floors before the new carpet is installed. 
Colored chalk will be provided, or bring crayons. No paint please. A $1 
donation will be expected. There are many ways to participate in the 
restoration. Join the Thousand Oaks Library Investment Group. A share of stock 
costs $20. Call Friends President Kathy Lewis at 498-9773 or Ruth Ann Cooper at 
495-5626, Ext. 138, to volunteer time, services and money.

 I can guarantee that spending an evening listening to Harlan Ellison talk 
about the power and purpose of the written word will be an electrifying 
experience. An acknowledged master of the difficult art of writing short 
stories, Ellison is the author or editor of 60 books, more than 1,500 stories, 
essays and articles and dozens of screenplays and teleplays. He is 
uncomfortably honest, often exasperating and always brilliant. His seminar "On 
Being a Writer," sponsored by Learning Tree University of Chatsworth and 
Thousand Oaks, is scheduled at 7 p.m. Tuesday in the Warner Center Marriott, 
Woodland Hills. The cost is $39. To register, call 497-2292 or (818) 882-5599.

 We all know that love: makes the world go round, is a many-splendored thing 
and creates jingling cash registers on Valentine's Day. But did you know that 
romance novels account for more than 50% of the books published and sold in 
this country? And that writing good genre fiction is a great way to get a first 
book published? Margaret Brownley of Simi Valley, the author of 11 novels 
including "The Kissing Bandit" and the just released "Rawhide and Lace," will 
conduct her "Passion on Paper: How to Write and Sell Romance Novels" seminar 
from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. March 5 at Learning Tree University, 1408 Thousand 
Oaks Blvd., Thousand Oaks. The fee is $69. Call 497-2292 to register.

'BLUE CHIPS' CASHES IN ON SPORTS AND THE SLAM POWER OF SHAQ O'NEAL; IN "BLUE 
CHIPS," A PASSIONATE AND IDEALISTIC COLLEGE BASKETBALL COACH (NICK NOLTE) 
EXPERIENCES HIS FIRST LOSING SEASON, SUCCUMBS TO BRIBING NEW RECRUITS 
(INCLUDING NBA STAR SHAQUILLE O'NEAL) FOR THE NEXT SEASON, BUT DISCOVERS THE 
EMPTINESS OF A VICTORY REACHED THROUGH CHEATING. (RATED PG-13)

 Young star-struck sports fans, wearing their backward baseball caps and 
X-Large T-shirts, came to this movie for two reasons and two reasons only: 
sports and stars. 
</P>
<P>
 They were only mildly disappointed. The problems? Too much boring story. Not 
enough detail in the basketball scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was OK, but it was boring in the middle," said Jason Poulos, 10. "He just 
walks around talking to his wife," he said speaking of Nolte. "It needed more 
playing time." Moreover, he complained, "The camera too much moved around. You 
couldn't follow the ball that much." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Howard, 12, said the camera motion made him dizzy. Even so, he saw the 
movie twice in three days. 
</P>
<P>
 For most, under-the-table recruiting was a new concept. But clearly, the kids 
did not fall for the film's conventional moral that this kind of recruiting is 
wrong, or as Nolte tells his players in the end: "The rules don't make much 
sense, but I believe in the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they seemed to buy the argument of the sleazy suit who represented 
the wealthy alumni supporters of the bribery program: i.e., these talented 
athletes make a lot of money for the school, yet they get nothing in return, so 
why not give them something? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see why they shouldn't buy them," said Sean Mulvaney, 10. College 
basketball, he reasoned, is just like the NBA. "They're learning new things and 
making money for the colleges." 
</P>
<P>
 Added his friend Jason: "Why not give some to the players? They do it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, it was wrong for Nolte to break the rules, but the rules are stupid. So, 
Jason said, "They should change the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 In the movie, one player gets $30,000 cash in a sports bag plus a new tractor 
for his farmer father to sign a letter of intent to play for the fictional 
Western University. Another gets a suburban home for his inner-city mother and 
her other children. O'Neal is offered the keys to a Lexus but refuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying they should get thirty grand," Jason said. "Maybe just 10%." 
</P>
<P>
 Sean's 9-year-old brother, Michael, said the movie taught him a lot about 
basketball. What he learned, he said, was "you just got to put your mind to it 
if you are going to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe he saw a different movie. Maybe it was "Rudy." 
</P>
<P>
 But at least one boy said he appreciated the film precisely because it did not 
have a predictable and sappy moral. Like "Rudy." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like some other movies where it comes out to be a good ending," said 
Chris Carlton, 12. "It's like a true story." He was pretty sure the concluding 
subtitles, explaining how the characters ended up years later, were not really 
true. "But they could have been," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris said he was surprised that O'Neal, who also markets himself as a rap 
singer, did not have a larger role. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would be more about Shaq O'Neal. It was more about the coach," 
Chris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most kids thought that O'Neal is better at acting than singing. But they 
agreed that he should probably keep his day job. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick McCaffrey, 11, observed there was "a lot of cussing" in the movie on 
the part of the coaches. But hey, he said, he's used to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Personally, what I liked about the film was what the kids didn't like: all the 
boring talk -- and the unconventional filming of the action, including mid-game 
strategy huddles. Nolte had me convinced he really was a tormented idealist, 
agonizing over his deal with the devil. 
</P>
<P>
 But one thing we agreed on hands down: It sure is a kick to watch Shaquille 
O'Neal slam-dunk.

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; PROJECTIONISTS PAN THE USE OF YOUTH IN BOOTH; 
LOCAL UNION CHAPTER SAYS TOO MANY THEATERS ARE USING SEMISKILLED WORKERS. 
</P>

 Remember Toto, the little boy so enraptured by movies that he crossed himself 
before entering the projection booth at the Cinema Paradiso? 
</P>
<P>
 His tireless effort to learn the mysteries of celluloid made for an 
Oscar-winning film, but the local chapter of the International Alliance of 
Theatrical Stage Employees and Motion Picture Machine Operators takes issue 
with youth in the booth. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the local, which includes projectionists, complain that too many 
first-run movie houses put young, semiskilled employees at the lever. As a 
result, the number of union projectionists in Ventura County has declined 75% 
in 15 years. There are now only 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "About half of first-runs in the county employ semiskilled labor," Simi Valley 
projectionist William Clark said. "They use tag teams of kids who they pay $6 
an hour." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the projection booth has become more automated, Clark said many 
little things still go wrong -- soft focus, low light and fuzzy sound, to name 
a few. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing what audiences will sit through," Clark said. "We're lucky the 
result is as good as high school (audiovisual) services." 
</P>
<P>
 If that isn't dispiriting for an old lamplighter, Clark said the next leap in 
automation will be receiving movies over cable and processing the signal 
through a "light valve" projector, a device with few moving parts that could 
run virtually unattended. 
</P>
<P>
 Toto, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.

 An unusually large feature film production is camped out in Ventura. "The Baby 
Sitter" is unusual not for its budget, a trifling $2 million, but because the 
entire film is being shot here over the course of 24 days, publicist David 
Linck said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be using a couple of houses on Foothill (Road) for the interior shots," 
Linck said. "We're also going to be shooting at the Busy Bee Cafe and an alley 
next to the Ventura Theater." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Baby Sitter" is an adaptation of a short story by Robert Coover. It stars 
Alicia Silverstone ("The Crush") as a very attractive but otherwise ordinary 
young woman who becomes the object of fantasy for three men in the town -- her 
boyfriend, his rival and the man for whom she is baby-sitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Linck would disclose no more about the plot, but if you're really that 
interested, the Ventura County Library has a collection of Coover's short 
stories titled "Pricksongs and Descants," which includes "The Baby Sitter." 
</P>
<P>
 The film, produced by Steve Perry ("Lethal Weapon" and "Die Hard") and Kevin 
Messick, has yet to find a distributor, but they hope to have it ready for next 
year's Sundance Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Linck estimates that the picture will contribute $1 million to the area's 
economy. Filming should wrap in mid-March. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Due to an overflow crowd at last week's Ojai Film Society screening of 
"Farewell My Concubine," the film will be shown again 4 p.m. Saturday at the 
Ojai Playhouse, 145 E. Ojai Ave.

MUSIC; BAND SERVES UP STEW OF FUNKY GARAGE RAP; HAROLD LEE, FORMERLY OF LOS 
GUYS, LEADS THE NEW RICE AND BEANS IN A LOUD AND FURIOUS GUITAR GROOVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL LOCEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Remember Harold Lee, the shredding guitar player for Los Guys, those peerless 
purveyors of intellectually challenging, aesthetically pleasing, totally 
off-the-wall, wise-guy folk songs? Forget about them. Lee's got a new gig now. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jeremy Donaldson moved to Oregon to work on an MA in engineering, that 
ended Los Guys and left Lee as El Dude. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's new band, Rice and Beans, gives fresh meaning to the word eclectic . For 
one, Lee changed his name to Soi Being; bassist Chris Ohno became Fri Ri; 
drummer Oscar Hermosillo became James Bean, and vocalist Dave Cassell, became 
Bean Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides being twice as big, Rice and Beans is twice as loud, doing a sonic 
stew of funky garage rap with an attitude. Lee -- who during pre-gig sound 
checks used to sample every guitar solo from every rock song from the '70s -- 
still does some guitar solos, but not many. Now he's more integrated into the 
overall sound rather than being the Guitar God of Los Guys days. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sort of feels like I'm stepping out from all that to play very loud rock 
'n' roll," Lee said just prior to the band's recent Ventura Theatre debut. 
"It's completely different. For one thing, I party a lot more with Rice and 
Beans." 
</P>
<P>
 What would you expect from a band that made its debut on Halloween at 
Hermosillo's grandma's house in Fontana? 
</P>
<P>
 The band was easy to put together because all the members, with the exception 
of Lee, live together in Goleta. But, like most local folks, none of the guys 
is from this area. Lee is from Connecticut, Ohno is from Duarte, Hermosillo is 
from La Puente and Dave C. is from East L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Dave, it all started with a call from Ohno. 
</P>
<P>
 "So he calls me up one day and says, 'Hey Dave, we want you to front our 
band,' " Lee said. "I thought, 'What band?' So I came up and sat in, and it 
worked. Before, I was in a Riverside band called Apple Core. I was playing 
guitar, but somehow I wasn't expressing myself. I've been in bands since I was 
11 years old. I'm no good at anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Ventura Theatre gig, Dave C. paced the big stage like a cat in jail as 
the other three pounded out a furious funk groove. Lee, shirtless and smiling, 
jumped off the stage and sprinted through the mostly underage crowd before 
jumping back on stage to take a few laps around the drummer, all the while 
never missing a lick. 
</P>
<P>
 All this energy seemed to inspire the youth of Ventura to play human pinball 
as a mild mosh pit started to swirl clockwise. Even a few females joined in, 
with no reported loss of blood or teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always different," Hermosillo said. "Sometimes they dance, sometimes 
they just groove on our cartoon disco music. One time my mom came to a gig and 
wondered why they'd let us play in such a nice place." 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of bands say it, but Beans and Rice really is a garage band. They made 
their first tape on an eight-track recorder in the garage -- now Two Tamales in 
a Wok Studio. And eight songs for three bucks is quite a deal. They'll only 
have to sell about 4 million tapes to have as much money as U2 spends each year 
on limos. 
</P>
<P>
 "We use a lot more samples and spontaneous stuff when we play live," said the 
singer. "We've been playing a lot lately. The first time we played downtown 
Santa Barbara, we played with Primal Tribe, but the club didn't like us too 
much because I cussed too much. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then we played at Toes, and the place was totally happening on a Wednesday 
night, and the club that didn't like us called us back. We're going to start 
playing San Francisco and L.A. We've got family and friends and places to 
stay." 
</P>
<P>
 And in a show just added seconds before press time, Rice and Beans will also 
play Saturday at the Midnight Hour in Ventura, where owner Larry Burdorf offers 
another of his Larrypaloozas, this one featuring Bloody Mary Morning and those 
friends of Deadheads everywhere, Mr. Ectomy. Details

 Childhood tales told around the campfire. The passing down of bits of cultural 
history from generations past. 
</P>
<P>
 What we're talking about is the art of storytelling -- an art that will be 
well-represented at the Arts Outreach program's third annual Flying Leap 
Storytelling Festival, Friday and Saturday in and around Solvang. 
</P>
<P>
 "Storytelling is a way for people to find out about cultures, including their 
own," said local storyteller Michael Katz, director of the festival. "It's a 
way for people to find out more about themselves. You find out about human 
behavior. Hopefully you can learn lessons." 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said storytelling, unlike most theater, calls for audience involvement. 
"In storytelling you're speaking directly to the audience. Sometimes you go out 
into the audience. You respond to the audience," he said. "It's an art form 
that touches people." 
</P>
<P>
 The festival will open Friday at 8 p.m. with ghost stories told by Katz and 
Johnny Moses at the Sidestreet Cafe in Los Olivos. At the same time, Nadja 
Forest will get the emotions rolling with what is likely to be a funny, 
politically conscious, improvisational storytelling session at Carey Cellars in 
Solvang. While you're there you can partake in some wine tasting. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, it's over to Solvang's Royal Scandinavian Inn. From 10 to 11:30 
a.m. Clara Yen will share Chinese folk tales, Sandra MacLees will tell 
bittersweet personal anecdotes and David Novak will portray various characters 
in personal and traditional stories. Also from 10 to 11:30 a.m., Nina Ryne, 
Katz, Moses, and young storytellers will present a children's show. 
</P>
<P>
 From noon to 1:30 p.m., the public will have a chance to exchange stories in 
the Swapping Ground at Solvang Park. From 2 to 3:30 p.m.: Oxnard native James 
Donlan will tell his stories of America through the eyes of a dog riding in the 
back of a pick-up truck; Sylviana Wood will tell bilingual stories from the 
barrio and Moses will share Native American legends from the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out the day: A storytelling workshop with Novak and MacLees, also 
from 2 to 3:30 p.m.; Cowboy poetry with Jake Copass, bluegrass music by members 
of the Cache Valley Drifters, and square dancing from 4 to 6 p.m. For the 
double finale, you can either see the Storytelling Showcase featuring six of 
the storytellers or hear more dog stories from Donlan and listen to the "folky 
blues" music of Tom Ball and Kenny Sultan. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for the Friday night wine-tasting event are $15. An all-day pass for 
Saturday's festival is $20 for adults and $10 for children. Admission to either 
of the final evening shows is $10 adults, $6 children. Tickets for all other 
individual events (except for the free Swapping Ground) are $6 adults, $4 
children. The Scandinavian Inn is located at 400 Alisal Rd. For directions to 
other venues or to reserve tickets, call 688-9533.

<P>
 Grammy Award-winning pianist Alicia de Larrocha and guest conductor Bernard 
Rubenstein will lead the Santa Barbara Symphony in concert Friday and Saturday 
at Santa Barbara's Arlington Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 De Larrocha's distinguished recording and performance career includes recitals 
around the world. Last year she appeared with the New York Philharmonic, the 
San Francisco Symphony, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the New York Chamber 
Orchestra and the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra at Carnegie Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubenstein has served as associate conductor of the Cincinnati Symphony and as 
music director for the Tulsa Symphony. 
</P>
<P>

THEATER REVIEW; DANCING ADDS DAZZLE TO THIN 'NANETTE' STORY; THE UNINVOLVING 
PLOT COULD USE MORE OF DIRECTOR JON ENGSTROM'S EXUBERANT TAP NUMBERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While the real star of "No, No Nanette" never appears on stage, there's no 
mistaking his signature. 
</P>
<P>
 The precision tap dancing, dazzling chorus formations and lighthearted 
exuberance can mean only one thing -- director/choreographer Jon Engstrom is 
back for another collaboration with the Santa Barbara Civic Light Opera. 
</P>
<P>
 Engstrom's forte is turning amateurs on the chorus line into professional 
dancers. His past efforts for the Light Opera -- "42nd Street," "Singin' in the 
Rain" and "Guys and Dolls" -- have been among the company's liveliest and 
deservedly most popular shows. 
</P>
<P>
 And each time "No, No, Nanette" erupts in movement and color, Engstrom's 
guidance is as sure as ever, with the guaranteed result of jaw-dropping 
amazement and spontaneous applause. 
</P>
<P>
 Only problem is, those eruptions are few and far between. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the wall-to-wall production numbers in "42nd Street," or the 
near-continuous acrobatics of "Singin' in the Rain," a large part of "No, No, 
Nanette's" three-hour running time is occupied with telling a story that can 
barely hold the songs together. 
</P>
<P>
 We're talking big-time fluff here -- a simple-minded plot that makes even 
"Annie" seem like a Dostoevsky novel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nanette's" complications -- such as they are -- revolve around a wealthy 
Bible publisher trying to keep his wife and young niece from finding out about 
his innocent but suspicious-looking philanthropic entanglements with a trio of 
gold diggers. 
</P>
<P>
 To the original 1914 story, a 1971 rewrite by Burt Shevelove added a subplot 
about the niece -- Nanette -- trying to break out of the prim constraints to 
which her social status condemns her. 
</P>
<P>
 Talented professionals in the lead roles keep the delivery lively. Christina 
Saffran as Nanette sings beautifully and transitions deftly from prissy 
socialite to (relatively) uninhibited hedonist. 
</P>
<P>
 Lew Horn has plenty of Teddy-bear appeal as the uncle, Susie Lockheed Lehto's 
goofy charm makes her the most endearing of the freeloading ladies, and, in 
supporting roles as the family lawyer and his wife, Vernon Willet's 
wheeler-dealing and Kathi Gillmore's comically exaggerated shopping sprees are 
welcome distractions. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's Barbara Perry's spectacular turn as Nanette's tap-dancing Aunt Sue, a 
role that brought Ruby Keeler out of retirement in 1971, that will leave 
audiences eager to start working out again. Perry's dancing in the 
show-stopping "I Want to Be Happy" is so tight it's hard for the male chorus to 
keep up with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Engstrom danced in the chorus of that 1971 production, and his 
affectionate staging throughout bathes the show in a charming nostalgic haze. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, there's only so far an audience can go on sentiment. If we've 
got to endure this much dialogue between dance numbers, emotions have to be 
engaged. In "Guys and Dolls," for example, Engstrom made sure his performers 
found the dramatic moments that defined their characters. 
</P>
<P>
 In "No, No, Nanette," the moments just aren't there to be found. Details

FOR THE KIDS; A BUG, A FROG, A KISS AND SOME FUN AT HAND; PUPPETEER BEGAN WITH 
A WASHCLOTH AND A CROSS CHILD. NOW SHE HAS 30 MARIONETTES, 100 HAND PUPPETS AND 
A LOVE OF PERFORMING.

<P>
 Meet E. Bladimus Plabida. He's an ornery bug who resides on the hand of 
puppeteer Arla Crane. It's there that he tangles with fellow puppet Frederico, 
a good-hearted frog. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow it all ends with a kiss. Happy endings are the norm in Crane's 
Alphabet Soup Puppeteers productions. 
</P>
<P>
 E. Bladimus and Fred, along with a cast of other colorful personalities, will 
be taking the stage Saturday at the Camarillo Art Center, 3150 Ponderosa Drive. 
Show time is 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids will get more than a puppet show. After the performance, Crane will hold 
a workshop to show them how to make paper hand puppets. The cost for both is 
$3. 
</P>
<P>
 Crane knows puppets inside out. She has about 30 marionettes and another 100 
or so hand puppets that she and her husband, Jay, have made over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a painstaking art. The basic marionette takes 40 to 100 hours to build, 
using a mold for the body. For a more elaborate puppet, with eyes that blink, 
for instance, it might take up to 200 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 She has had time to perfect the art. Her Camarillo-based Alphabet Soup 
Puppeteers has been around since 1976, performing for schools, fairs, birthday 
parties and television. 
</P>
<P>
 "I backed into it, really," Crane said, explaining her humble start. Her two 
sons were young then and one of them hated having his face washed. So one day 
Crane put a washcloth over her hand and started talking to him, hoping to 
distract him while she scrubbed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He started talking back -- to the hand, as if it were real," she recalled. It 
was then that she realized that children have the ability to give life to 
inanimate things. She began doing puppet shows for children at the local 
library, where she worked part time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been hooked ever since," she said. She joined the Central Coast Puppetry 
Guild, a tri-county group with members from San Luis Obispo to Thousand Oaks, 
and honed her puppetry skills. 
</P>
<P>
 She does a one-woman show, writing the skits herself. She is turned off by the 
violence of some of the traditional fairy tales, preferring a Sesame Street 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
 During her shows, she involves the children, sometimes getting them to help 
create a character or help with the plot. "Children have a thousand stories in 
them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's show and workshop is aimed at kids 2 to 8 years old. All supplies 
for making the puppets will be provided. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Games, games, games, all day long. That's what's on tap at the Gull Wings 
Children's Museum in Oxnard on Saturday. Kids can play ring-toss or throw bean 
bags or play hide-and-seek. The day of games is one of the museum's most 
popular events. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum is at 418 W. 4th St., Oxnard. For information, call 483-3005.

JAUNTS; HATCHERY WELCOMES VISITORS TO JOIN IN THE FEEDING FRENZY; ABOUT 1 
MILLION RAINBOW TROUT SPEND THEIR FORMATIVE MONTHS AT THE FILLMORE FACILITY, 
OPEN DAILY TO THE PUBLIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's feeding time at the Fillmore Fish Hatchery, and the fish are jumping -- 
thousands of them, wiggling fin to fin, in huge troughs of water that splash 
and bubble with all the ruckus. 
</P>
<P>
 The fish, rainbow trout, even get excited before the food arrives. They can 
sense the vibration of the feeding cart as it approaches, spewing high-protein 
animal and plant meal out of a long mechanical arm into the water. 
</P>
<P>
 While Fillmore is still reeling from damage caused by the Jan. 17 earthquake, 
the constant feeding frenzy at the fish hatchery goes on as usual. The hatchery 
wasn't damaged in the quake, but it shut down for two days while the operation 
was on auxiliary power. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost a few fish," said Terry West, assistant manager of the hatchery. 
About 600 in all -- either from sloshing out of the troughs or from lack of 
oxygen when the air-flow system was jostled. 
</P>
<P>
 But when you deal with 1 million fish, the loss is not considered much. That's 
the number of rainbow trout the hatchery raises each year for planting in 
Southern California lakes and streams. 
</P>
<P>
 You can see the rearing in progress. The hatchery, operated by the California 
Department of Fish and Game, is open to the public. Although there are no 
guided tours, the hatchery is open for viewing from 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. daily, 
and there is no charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The fish arrive at the hatchery in the form of fertile eggs for the final 
stages of incubation, which lasts three to five days. That part of the process 
is too delicate to be open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 When the tiny fish are ready to start feeding, they are put into "raceways" 
composed of a series of rearing ponds. Each is a rectangular concrete trough 
measuring 100 feet long, 10 feet wide and 32 inches deep. 
</P>
<P>
 As they grow, they graduate to nine other such troughs, each one housing 
gradually larger fish. The biggest tend to nibble on the smallest, so they 
can't be raised together. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're very cannibalistic," West said. 
</P>
<P>
 They do love to eat -- and eat often. The larger ones feed four to six times a 
day and the smaller ones 12 times a day. Almost any time you visit the 
hatchery, you'll see some feeding activity. Also, visitors can pay 5 cents for 
a handful of feed to toss into the water and watch the frenzy. (Don't bring 
food from home because it gums up their delicate digestive systems.) 
</P>
<P>
 Signs warn visitors not to put their hands in the water or try to grab the 
fish. The most outrageous case of fish nabbing occurred there during the 1970s. 
As West tells it, four guys wearing overalls were caught pulling fish out by 
dropping lines down their pants' legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Fish and Game workers installed netting over the rearing ponds eight 
years ago, the 52-year-old hatchery was continually pilfered by other culprits: 
egrets and herons that snatched about 30% of the fish. The birds still hang out 
within view of the hatchery, but workers now feed them the 25 to 30 fish that 
normally die each day. 
</P>
<P>
 For the survivors, their stay at the hatchery lasts almost a year. When they 
have fattened up to about half a pound -- ranging from 7 to 12 inches long -- 
they are ready for planting, according to West. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, they could end up in Lake Casitas, Lake Piru or Rose Lake 
or in a number of streams, including Matilija, Reyes, Santa Paula and upper 
Sespe creeks and the north fork of the Ventura River. Fish and Game officials 
say now is the busiest season for planting fish, although it extends from 
September through June. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without the hatcheries in California, we would not have the sport of fishing 
as we know it today," West said. There simply wouldn't be enough fish. 
</P>
<P>
 The trout hatchery is one of 11 operated throughout the state by the 
Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without tours, the hatchery draws 3,000 to 7,000 visitors a month, 
depending on the time of year. For some, it's almost therapy, according to 
West. "I've heard people mention that water calms the nerves. It's very 
soothing for what ails them." Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Fillmore Fish Hatchery. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Off California 126, about one mile east of Fillmore. Watch for the 
turnoff to the south of the highway. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Viewing hours are 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: There is no charge, but fish food can be purchased for 5 cents. For 
information, call (310) 590-5132. Call (310) 590-5020 to hear a recording about 
the fish-planting schedule.

 Our dog hides her head under the bed whenever she sees our luggage come out of 
storage. She's a sorry sight. She knows suitcases on the bed mean someone is 
leaving. We feel like giving her Prozac for her depression. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the same luggage we've used for years now and, lately, when we pull it 
out, we feel like taking Prozac, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids were the last to use our nifty duffel bags. But they took them to 
three different camps last summer, so we can kiss those babies goodby. Sure 
they could be cleaned. And fumigated. But the Pearl Jam stickers are never 
coming off. We prefer to look on this occasion as a unique opportunity to 
upgrade our traveling kit. 
</P>
<P>
 First stop is Jay's Luggage in The Oaks mall. Jay's is an upscale luggage and 
gift shop that has been in business since 1940. They carry most of the top 
brands and they also have their own less pricey brand of luggage, called 
Dilana. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay's is a great place to start when shopping for luggage. The sales staff is 
knowledgeable and the selection is vast. The latest trend in luggage, according 
to saleswoman Lyn Hanks, is the "roll-aboard" or "wheel-aboard" carry-on. We 
had visions of walking smartly down long airport terminals with the ease of an 
airline attendant. These cases have retractable handles and built-in wheels. 
They can easily glide down the aisle of an airplane or through a hotel lobby. 
Remember to smile politely when you pass the porter. 
</P>
<P>
 These roll-aboard carry-ons can be found in every price range. Jay's has one 
by Delsey for $139.99. Their Tumi carry-on is $375. The difference in price 
reflects the difference in material, construction and thus longevity. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't plan on checking your luggage, the cheaper brands most likely 
will service the infrequent traveler. If you plan on embarking on a real 
journey, the better brands will be worth the extra money. 
</P>
<P>
 Before you buy, take a good look at all the different styles of luggage. Give 
some thought to how you usually travel. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't foresee a cruise in your future, you probably shouldn't take that 
steamer trunk. If you're a frequent flier, then you know that grease marks are 
a common sight on well-used bags. Black, and other dark colors, do the best job 
of hiding these marks. 
</P>
<P>
 People who travel a lot know that two small bags are a lot easier to handle 
than one large one. Also, check the weight of the bag you like. It should be 
light. It's empty, after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Handles are important. Make sure they're soft and wide enough so they won't 
dig into your hand when the bag is filled with gear. Shoulder straps are great 
for keeping your hands free for more luggage (or holding the hands of small 
children). 
</P>
<P>
 Luggage by Travel Pro looked like a good value. It was designed by a retired 
airline pilot and is currently sold at Jay's. Prices range from $59.99 for an 
expanding duffel to $219.99 for the garment bag. All these pieces have 
retractable handles and wheels for easy traveling. 
</P>
<P>
 A personal favorite is Tumi luggage. These soft-sided bags come in leather or 
"ballistic" nylon, the material originally designed for bulletproof vests. The 
nylon is incredibly strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Tumi has that discreet and tasteful look of the '90s. The color range is 
limited -- black and a couple of shades of green. Their Dakota line gets crazy 
with a tan trim on green. It's more of an "I'm going on safari" look. While 
Tumi is rarely found on sale, gift certificates are offered as incentives. When 
you purchase $350 or more of the luggage, you receive $100 off your next 
purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 While Jay's offers less expensive (and more expensive) luggage, we did check a 
few other sources for comparison. The Price Club had a Samsonite "Large Wheeled 
Piggyback" (a 25-inch hard-sided Pullman) for $149.98. They also had an 
American Tourister garment bag for $89.99. 
</P>
<P>
 Price Club had a four-piece Tapestry set by Hampshire for $144.99, if you are 
into the Mary Poppins look. This is a great gift for a person who travels by 
automobile. It's probably not rugged enough for a frequent flier. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a good time of year to visit the department stores for luggage sales. 
The Broadway had some great markdowns on discontinued styles by Samsonite and 
Delsey. They also had some newer styles by Delsey and Helium for 50% off. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall's had a complete set of nice-looking luggage by a company eerily 
named Amelia Earhart. Prices ranged from $99 to $160. They also had a variety 
of pieces by Adolfo, Diane Von Furstenberg and Geoffrey Beene. 
</P>
<P>
 A quick look in the Yellow Pages and we found discount luggage shops in Los 
Angeles and the San Fernando Valley. Prices were roughly 20% to 35% less if you 
want to travel for your luggage. If not, Ventura County has enough to keep our 
poor dog hiding under the bed for quite some time.

 If you've decided you want to do volunteer work -- but you're not sure exactly 
what -- here are a few questions to answer, gleaned from conversations with 
Ventura County volunteer coordinators. 
</P>
<P>
 Have you hobbies or other activities you really enjoy? 
</P>
<P>
 If you're a crack bridge player or craft worker, amateur gardener or 
journal-keeper, for example, you may be able to teach a class at a local senior 
center. If you're a bibliophile and eternal student, consider working in your 
local library. 
</P>
<P>
 You may be drawn to spending time with children, or love animals, or want to 
spend more time outdoors; seek a volunteer position that brings you into 
contact with what you enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are no longer working, would you prefer volunteer work that is similar 
to your former career or different? 
</P>
<P>
 If you would rather do something new, consider a program that involves 
training and the opportunity to learn a new skill. 
</P>
<P>
 Is one of your motivations in doing volunteer work to meet people? Or would 
you just as soon stuff envelopes or enter data into a computer? 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, take this into account. 
</P>
<P>
 Do your friends find you easy to talk to and say you're a good listener? 
</P>
<P>
 Have you helped a loved one through a terminal illness or a friend with a 
substance abuse problem? You may have acquired valuable listening and support 
skills that could be put to use in agencies that help clients cope with these 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Are you someone who has never worked and therefore see yourself has having no 
skills? 
</P>
<P>
 Look more closely at your life. If you've been a housewife and mother, for 
example, you may have worked at many unpaid jobs -- such as with the PTA or 
keeping the household budget -- and in the process gained "hidden" 
organizational and management skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Are you afraid you can't commit to volunteer work because you work full-time? 
</P>
<P>
 Many jobs call for weekend or evening hours, and most volunteer coordinators 
are sensitive to your time restraints. 
</P>
<P>
 But remember, those served by volunteer organizations seek help year-round. 
According to Debbie Hill of HELP of Ojai. "The need is great -- and growing.

 On a typical day -- deadline at the end of the week, daughter needs advice on 
her college applications, grocery list as long as my arm -- I called volunteer 
organizations with a list of questions: How would a typical Ventura County 
resident go about getting involved in volunteer work? What sort of work needs 
doing? Would previous skills or special training be required? 
</P>
<P>
 After a flurry of calls, I found that many organizations require an 
application and interview, some a training process. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pat McLean, of Project Understanding's Family to Family, was happy to have 
me just show up. "Drop in any time," she said, "just for an hour or two. We can 
always use the help." The flexibility suited my schedule and it sounded like a 
good way to start. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a chilly December morning when I arrived at the Total Life Christian 
Center on Ventura Avenue, the facility used by Family to Family. On the street 
in front, a handful of men, women and children milled around, waiting for the 
doors to open at 11:30. There were loners from the street, single moms pushing 
strollers, families with kids in tow. All had come for a free meal, served 
three days a week to anyone in need -- no questions asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, volunteers relaxed over coffee, discussing the ups and downs of the 
real estate market, the challenge of juggling family life and career. "This is 
the calm before the storm," one told me. 
</P>
<P>
 Family to Family relies on local church groups, business organizations and 
individuals for its volunteer staff; this day, the meal had been cooked and 
donated by a Century 21 office, and there were more volunteers than could fit 
in the tiny kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, when I said I'd come to help, I was given a hearty welcome and an 
assignment: to clear and wipe each place at the table as it became vacant, in 
preparation for the next diner. 
</P>
<P>
 When the doors opened promptly at 11:30, the handful waiting outside had grown 
to more than 200, who filled the dining room with activity and chatter. 
Children laughed and cried, and old friends greeted each other across the room. 
Everyone seemed eager to come in out of the cold and formed a long line, 
patiently waiting for volunteers to hand out paper plates filled with turkey, 
mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, rolls -- with pumpkin and apple pie for 
dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 I stood around awkwardly, jumping at every chance to wipe down a table; most 
of the diners considerately dropped their paper plates in the bins, leaving me 
with little to do. Then, an older woman started speaking to me in Spanish, 
which I understand in bits and pieces, but not well enough to make out what she 
was after. She patiently kept at it until I finally understood -- her legs are 
filled with pain, she told me. Could someone bring her a plate so she doesn't 
have to stand in line? I got a plate for her; in return, she hugged me. 
</P>
<P>
 More than enough food had been prepared, and seconds were given out. A man in 
his early 20s asked for a piece of tin foil to cover his plate. "I'd like to 
save this for later," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 I contemplated his words for a moment, wondering where he sleeps, where he and 
the others eat on days when Family to Family does not serve. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the old disheartening question came back to haunt me: How much good do 
the few hours I'm putting in here do this young man, or others like him? Isn't 
it as I suspected, that the world's problems are simply too enormous for one 
person to solve? 
</P>
<P>
 A smiling volunteer whizzed past me with a plate. I had been watching her, 
astounded by her energy, enthusiasm and positive attitude. Like other long-term 
volunteers I'd met -- at Ventura's AIDS Care, at Ojai's Little House Senior 
Center, at Food Share -- she seemed anything but despairing. 
</P>
<P>
 As we began to clean up at 12:45, a woman approached me and introduced herself 
as Ginny. "What church group are you with?" she asked. I told her I had come 
here on my own. "Oh, that's so sweet," she said. "Well, this meal was 
delicious, and it means a lot to us. Thank you so much, and God bless you." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's when it hit me, with the force of the obvious: It may just be a 
drop in the bucket. But drop by drop, that bucket will eventually become full.

EARTHWATCH: DEFENSE CONTRACTORS LOOK TO ENVIRONMENT; THEY ARE SEEKING CLEANUP 
JOBS IN THE WAKE OF CUTBACKS IN MILITARY SPENDING. 
</P>

 Last week, I shared an excellent meal with a group of recyclers. These were 
not my normal brand of recyclers -- you know, the ones who dine on organically 
grown veggies in a retrofitted adobe. No, these were defense contractors, 
eating mahi mahi at a Radisson Suites hotel in Oxnard. And what they were 
recycling was themselves; they were there to find out how to become 
environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 The event was a meeting of the Channel Islands chapter of the National 
Contract Managers Assn. This is a group of local business folk who administer 
contracts that, until recently, flowed in torrents to American industry from 
the Department of Defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies employ them to function as go-betweens between the defense supplier 
and the armed services involved. "We're high-level buyers," explained my 
table-mate for the evening, Marilyn Erwin of Mission Research Corp. The topic 
of the evening was how to get work from industries not being affected by the 
shrinking defense budget. 
</P>
<P>
 And that, according to the evening's speaker, might mean cozying up to the 
environmental industry. Yes, there is such an industry. Big companies, like the 
oil and chemical firms, also big government agencies like the EPA and the 
Energy Department have been putting out contracts for cleanups and 
retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 And some trained and qualified person has to be there to "monitor the 
performance," as Erwin put it. Are you and I, fellow Sierra Clubbers, going to 
go on daily patrol with our Geiger counters and bean counters to see that the 
repair work gets done and at the price promised in the cleanup contract? Well, 
maybe, but I doubt it. 
</P>
<P>
 There may be a big difference between building an air base and cleaning up 
after three generations of air-warriors have been refueling there, but at this 
dinner, I discovered that the same people who built America's war machine and 
supplied it for 50 years are gathering in hotel rooms around the country to 
learn how they can, in effect, clean up after the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "Environmental Contracting in the '90s: Opportunities and Pitfalls" was the 
announced topic for my night out in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The speaker, F. J. (Jack) Schroeder, is a leading light in this new trade. 
According to the printed program, Schroeder was originally an engineer on Air 
Force design and construction jobs in 20 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 He scared listeners -- including this one -- half to death with a recitation 
about the degradation of our local soil, air and water. But the audience was 
there to find out about new business opportunities, not to open a vein, so he 
thoughtfully switched to a list of businesses where members of the audience 
might offer their services as environmental contract supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Those in the crowd, asserted Schroeder, have been involved in keeping track of 
lots of hazardous materials (such as bombs and rocket fuel), as well as piles 
of war surplus materials (such as planes, parts, paints and parachutes). 
</P>
<P>
 He suggested that they now look to companies that handle toxic materials (such 
as paint and petroleum manufacturers), firms that transport waste products, and 
non-defense, public agencies that are stuck with messes (such as abandoned 
mines and toxic waste dumps) but have some money for cleaning them up. 
</P>
<P>
 In a pamphlet on the dinner table, which described the National Contract 
Management Assn., I got a glimpse of the future -- sort of. "In the near 
future, almost everyone in the field will contend with environmental issues," 
was a quote attributed to the group's national president, Mary Mayer. 
</P>
<P>
 I once saw a movie about the launderette business. One character challenged 
another about the profitability of such an enterprise. The proprietor retorted 
proudly: "Oh, there's money in muck." Details 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: Business people, technicians and lawyers interested in a seminar 
entitled "Commercial Environmental and International Contracting: An Evolving 
Focus," scheduled from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. March 4 at the Harbortown Marina Resort 
in Ventura, should call Deanna Carney at 987-8831, Ext. 219, for information.

FASHION; A WELL-DRESSED LOOK HELPS LIFT AGE BARRIER; GOOD GROOMING AND THE 
RIGHT CLOTHES GIVE OLDER APPLICANTS A BOOST WHEN LOOKING FOR JOBS. 
</P>

<P>
 We've talked recently about gearing up for a job interview. What to wear, how 
to comb your hair, whether to leave off the cologne, if midriffs should be 
covered. (They should be, if you missed last week's remarks.) 
</P>
<P>
 But what about that other factor that many job seekers believe figures into 
the equation: your, uh, age. If your looks have already crested, so to speak, 
will the corporate world take you at face value? How much is a 50-year-old face 
worth, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 What's that got to do with fashion, you say? Read on. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world is young, thin and good-looking," said Dixie Lee, who owns Center 
Stage Hair Design in Westlake Village. "You don't have to like it; but if 
you're not going to play by those rules, you're not going to get that job." 
</P>
<P>
 Lots of women come into her salon before facing job interviewers, Lee says. 
They seek counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're open, you know; they say, 'How do I look, what should I do?' 
(They're) doing all they can to get that job." 
</P>
<P>
 The first line of defense is hair color, according to Lee. "It's bad enough 
being over 50 without having gray hair on top of it. I speak from experience." 
</P>
<P>
 After color, stylists at Center Stage address hairstyles, makeup and even 
clothing. "If you're in the wrong color tones, it's very aging," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her overall advice is sobering: 
</P>
<P>
 "If you think you're going to keep your gray hair, be overweight and not stay 
in shape and not stay current with the clothes you wear -- you're going to be 
looking for a job for the next five years!" 
</P>
<P>
 So ingrained is the idea that employment goes to the young that some women, 
and men, go beyond grooming to improve their image. They head to the cosmetic 
surgeon's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "They feel that interviewers really take youthful appearance into 
consideration. I do too," said Dr. Brian Slywka, who has a surgery practice in 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Slywka says in the last five years that more patients mention employment 
concerns as the reason for seeking surgery, usually of the eyelids, face or 
neck. 
</P>
<P>
 A second surgeon, Dr. Louetta K. Westphal of Camarillo, said she has heard the 
same concerns from both sexes. Recently, more women have tied their desire for 
face-lifts with the need to compete for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a very legitimate concern because there have been numbers of 
studies that have shown that women who are attractive tend to get better jobs. 
And in our culture, youth is considered attractive," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the more conservative job-seeker, there's another factor operating in the 
job market. Or several, our sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 First, confidence counts. The older applicant with experience often has an 
edge, said Rita Gomberg, career resources specialist at Ventura College. ". . . 
unless you're talking about the re-entry woman who hasn't worked for 25 years 
and she has got a poor self-image." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, the older generation has a certain class. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find the older women more professionally dressed than the younger ones," 
said Catherine Lawrence, director of Pyramid Placement in Ventura. "Some of 
them are real nifty . . . and they're very current with their fashion and 
makeup. As long as a woman looks good and she's got it together in her style -- 
I have placed women in their 60s in secretarial jobs, and they are dynamite 
secretaries." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, not all age discrimination comes from appearance, anyway, said Chris 
Richards of Richards' Consulting in Thousand Oaks. Some of it is fiscal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 25-year-old sales rep you can hire for $25,000-$30,000 a year. The 45- to 
50-year-old experienced rep has a house with a mortgage and children in 
college. He requires a salary of $60,000, $70,000 or $80,000. . . . For many 
companies, the bottom line is return on investment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a few companies realize that the 50-year-old employee is more likely to 
stick around 15 years than is the new college graduate, he said. And this could 
work in someone's favor. 
</P>
<P>
 So, in the meantime, what should the mature job-seeker do to better his 
chances? 
</P>
<P>
 Easy. Get spiffed up. A haircut can't hurt. Look confident, think wisdom and 
experience. Know where your strengths are. And, for good measure: keep those 
midriffs covered.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; NICE SURPRISES IN MIDDLE OF THE ROAD; IT'S CASUAL AND IT'S A 
CHAIN, BUT THE ALE, THE STEAKS AND THE SETTING MAKE DINING AT THE CHART HOUSE A 
PLEASURE.

 "Hi, I'm Kati, and I'll be your waitress this evening," has never been a 
phrase calculated to win my heart. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not the least bit interested in trying, during the meal, to recall the 
waitress' name. I guess the prejudice I carry against this informality is 
what's made me tend to stay away from the casual, middle-of-the-road chain 
restaurants such as Charley Brown's, Chuck's Steak House -- and The Chart 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was with a stiff upper lip that I met the Critical Companion's 
suggestion that we stop at the contemporary wooden structure -- overlooking the 
freeway and the ocean, in that order -- across the street from the Pierpont Inn 
in Ventura. I'm-your-pal service and average steaks, I muttered, were to be 
avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 What a surprise it was, then, to find myself comfortably seated in an 
upholstered booth, the hum of the freeway below somewhat muted behind the 
closed doors and the winter sun setting gorgeously behind the Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chart House, which has 65 outlets in the United States, began, I was told, 
in 1969 when several surfers-turned-skiers opened a tiny restaurant and bar 
operation in Aspen, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 Several things immediately appealed to me at the Ventura Chart House. 
Specifically, the selection of draught beers -- Guinness stout, Bass ale and 
Pete's Wicked ale. With a tall glass of cold Bass ($3.50), I had no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
 In the modern, wooden, marine dining room, every table has a similar ocean 
view. And I had to grudgingly admit to the CC as we perused the menu: "Ol' Kati 
the waitress who does a cordial but not too cordial job, turns out to be a real 
professional." 
</P>
<P>
 Dining at a Chart House -- and I understand there are some differences among 
them, for example, some have seafood bars -- is a bit of a production. The 
salad bar, access to which comes with every entree ($1.95 by itself), stretches 
out quite a distance. Distinguishing characteristics include a freshly tossed 
Caesar salad -- an average rendition of the classic -- and a platter of caviar, 
crackers, onions, sour cream and egg. The lump-fish caviar emerges nearly 
inedibly salty. 
</P>
<P>
 There was dissension at our table with regard to the appetizers. The CC and I 
were in agreement that the artichoke ($4.75), served with a dish of melted 
butter and aioli sauce, is an excellent dish. But I felt that the shrimp 
cocktail ($8.95) produced watery shrimp, though the accompanying cocktail sauce 
was excellent, with a fresh horseradish tanginess. The New England clam chowder 
($4.50) was simply too gluttonous for my taste. 
</P>
<P>
 None of these were as good as the smoked salmon and cheese plate ($7.95), with 
a good-sized hunk of gently smoked fish. We ordered it as an appetizer at 
Kati's suggestion, even though it is found at the back of the menu, just above 
the draught beer selection. 
</P>
<P>
 Meat, apparently a staple of the original operation, is still the best thing 
going here. While it is cooking, you get to dig into awfully good bread -- two 
kinds -- that the Chart House brings in from its Paradise Bakery in San Diego. 
It's soft, doughy stuff and comes in a sourdough version and a sweet model, a 
brown bread of honey and molasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the meat. You can try the Alaskan king crab legs ($28.95), steamed 
and served with drawn butter, but they're pretty much your tasty but expensive 
variety. Or the fresh swordfish ($17.95), which I found meager in comparison to 
the other portions, overcooked and dull. Which is also the way I feel about the 
chicken breast Santa Fe ($14.95), which, though it's described as charbroiled 
and chili-coated, has only traces of chili and an uninspired blue cheese 
dressing. On the menu, the combination of flavors sounds great, but the dish 
itself doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 Try the charbroiled New York steak ($21.95). The piece is aged, hand cut and 
would stand up in just about any restaurant. Ditto for the filet mignon 
($22.95), beautifully charred on the outside, red as you want it on the inside. 
</P>
<P>
 While the CC was munching on the baby filet mignon ($17.95), I was tearing 
into the largest piece of meat on the menu, the Callahan ($21.95), an 
extra-thick cut of prime rib, complete with bone. This luscious hunk of red 
meat comes floating in its own juice and is served with a tangy horseradish 
sauce. One of the pluses here is that, if you want just plain horseradish, 
they've got it. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the items that has been around as long as the original Chart House is 
the mud pie. The CC and I remembered this as a crust of chocolate biscuit 
crumbs, in which sits coffee ice cream, chocolate syrup and perhaps whipped 
cream. True, the Chart House mud pie ($4.95) has all the ingredients, but the 
nearly six-inch block of ice cream gets boring, since you can't get a melding 
of flavors. I guess they feel the drama of those six inches is more important 
than the quality and taste of the dish. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd opt for the Belgian chocolate mousse pie ($4.50), a rich, chocolaty 
dessert, also in a cookie crumb crust, not too sweet and not too tall. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: The Chart House. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: 567 Sanjon Road, Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Open for dinner Monday through Friday, 5:30 to 10 p.m.; Saturday 5 to

TRANSIT OFFICIALS, MCA AGREE ON SUBWAY STATION SITE; METRO RAIL: AGREEMENT ENDS 
FIVE-MONTH CONTROVERSY. UNIVERSAL STUDIOS WILL BE LINKED TO THE STOP THROUGH 
PEOPLE-MOVER SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ending months of haggling with entertainment giant MCA, the county 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority approved an agreement Wednesday to link a 
planned subway stop with MCA's sprawling Universal Studios complex through a 
people-mover system. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal ends a lobbying campaign by MCA to relocate the station from 
Lankershim Boulevard to a site nearer MCA'S CityWalk attraction -- a move 
transit planners consider too expensive and time-consuming. MCA and the county 
agreed on a city-brokered compromise to keep the station on Lankershim but 
connect it to a shuttle bound for Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very happy that it's over," said Larry Spungin, president of MCA 
development. "Just as MTA can embark on what it has to do, we can embark on 
what we have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 For MCA, the next step is to consider its options for a people-mover system, 
which would be at least 1,000 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
 The entertainment company has agreed to fund the system. Although technically 
not bound to provide a shuttle service, MCA is committed to trying to make the 
concept work, representatives said. 
</P>
<P>
 City transit officials have suggested a monorail-type system that could cost 
as much as $20 million. However, MCA executives say no particular technology 
has been selected or maximum price established. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just not knowledgeable enough of the problems," Spungin said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the county transit agency, Wednesday's agreement means that the Universal 
City Metro Rail project can proceed as planned, without the costly delays of 
further studies or scrapping the current plan. Under the terms of the 
compromise, the county will pay for two entrances on the east side of the 
Lankershim station, in addition to the pair planned for the west side. 
Passengers will be able to exit through the eastern portals via an underground 
walkway beneath Lankershim. 
</P>
<P>
 Transit analyst Judith Wilson said the $2 million required for the tunnel and 
extra entrances can be covered through various project reserve funds and will 
not cause any cost overruns. 
</P>
<P>
 The transit agency is also responsible for various roadway improvements to 
ease traffic, such as widening Lankershim by 22 feet and adding new ramps to 
the Hollywood Freeway. Those expenses, estimated at between $4 million and $5 
million, also are to be incorporated into the current budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement lays to rest a controversy that involved MCA and the county for 
five months. Last fall, MCA threatened to withhold millions of dollars in 
benefit-assessment fees unless the transit authority moved the subway stop half 
a mile southeast from the current site to one beneath the Hollywood Freeway, 
near Cahuenga Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 County planners said such a change in plans would cost $42 million and delay 
the scheduled opening in July, 2000, by nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
 At the prompting of Mayor Richard Riordan -- who was on hand Wednesday to vote 
on the agreement as a transit authority member -- city officials crafted a 
compromise blueprint that satisfied planners' demands to stay on schedule and 
MCA's request that the station better serve its theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners near the planned Red Line stop expressed relief that the station 
site had finally been agreed on. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're thrilled it's over," said Ronni Rice, who owns a nearby condominium 
that will be razed by the county to make way for the traffic improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she and others will have to move, Rice said she and her neighbors are 
happy to know the fate of their properties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been held hostage for two years," she said.

 The prosecution team that could not persuade two juries to unanimously convict 
Lyle and Erik Menendez of the murders of their parents has been replaced, Dist. 
Atty. Gil Garcetti announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Attys. David Conn and Carol Najera will take over the 
high-profile case from colleagues Pam Bozanich and Lester Kuriyama, he said in 
a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Conn, now acting head deputy of Garcetti's special trials division, will be 
the lead prosecutor in the second trial. He and Najera, Conn said at a news 
conference, will be ready to retry the case within two months. They will again 
seek a first-degree murder conviction and the death penalty, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jill Lansing, Lyle Menendez's lawyer, said: "Getting ready for this case in 60 
days would be a lot of work." Leslie Abramson, Erik Menendez's lawyer, could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg is expected to decide on a 
trial date at a hearing Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the statement, Garcetti praised Bozanich and Kuriyama. He did not elaborate 
on why he decided to replace the two. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution was widely regarded as the loser because both juries were 
deeply split on whether the 1989 shotgun slayings of Jose and Kitty Menendez at 
their Beverly Hills mansion constituted murder committed out of greed, or 
self-defense by adult sons who killed in fear after years of physical, mental 
and sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Bozanich told reporters recently that she would rather "eat ground glass for a 
year" than go through another Menendez trial. She reiterated that sentiment 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gone on record as indicating I do not want to retry this case," she 
said. "I'm very happy that my friend David Conn will be doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Conn and Bozanich worked together on the 1988 Bill Bradford murder case. 
Bradford was convicted and given the death penalty for luring young women into 
the desert, then raping and killing them. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuriyama, the less-experienced member of the first trial's prosecution team, 
had not tried a deathpenalty case before, said a spokeswoman for the district 
attorney's office. Kuriyama declined Wednesday to comment on his removal from 
the Menendez case. 
</P>
<P>
 Najera said she thought she and Conn were selected because of their 
"significant trial experience." They said they have tried two death penalty 
cases each. 
</P>
<P>
 Conn, a 15-year veteran, is best known for his successful prosecution of the 
four men charged in the so-called "Cotton Club" murder of theatrical impresario 
Roy Radin. 
</P>
<P>
 Najera, with nine years experience, last summer successfully prosecuted one of 
the lesser defendants in the Reginald O. Denny beating case that stemmed from 
the 1992 Los Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Her death penalty cases were the successful prosecution in 1992 of a man who 
killed an armored-truck driver during a series of highly publicized robberies 
in the Long Beach area and the earlier unsuccessful prosecution of a man 
accused of drug-related murders in Laurel Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Conn said he and Najera have to resolve whether to try the case before one 
jury or two; whether to present new evidence, and how best to dismantle the 
defense's negative portrayal of the slain parents. 
</P>
<P>
 A motion filed last week to have the second trial moved from the San Fernando 
Valley to the Downtown Los Angeles Criminal Courts Building is to be decided by 
Weisberg at the Monday hearing.

FROM JUDGE TO DEFENDANT; CAREER IS THREATENED BY FATAL ACCIDENT THAT WENT 
UNREPORTED FOR 4 HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Albert Garcia was an East Los Angeles success story. He was raised in poverty 
by a single mother, worked his way through college and then law school and 
eventually was named a Municipal Court judge in Compton where he quickly earned 
a reputation for courtesy and impartiality. 
</P>
<P>
 But his saga of success was derailed Monday night on an Eagle Rock side 
street. He totaled his Mercedes-Benz, leaving his passenger dead -- a 
35-year-old woman who had told friends she hoped Garcia would divorce his wife 
and marry her. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia wandered away from the accident and waited four hours to turn himself 
in. He was then booked on charges of suspected vehicular manslaughter and drunk 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Josie Smith, 35, died at the scene of the accident and leaves three children, 
ages 7, 12 and 14. She co-managed a popular Highland Park restaurant, founded 
by her parents 30 years ago, which has been deluged with condolence calls all 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The customers all loved her because she was so bubbly and full of life. . . . 
If anybody was ever down she would tell a joke and make them laugh," said her 
sister, Angie Montes. "Her downfall was picking the wrong kind of man." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia's once promising career is now in question. On Wednesday, he requested 
two weeks leave, but it is not clear if and when he will be returning to the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
 He began seeing Smith about two years ago, Garcia's friends say, when he was 
separated from his wife. After he tried to break up with Smith last summer, 
there was a fight in his chambers and Garcia called court security to have her 
removed. Smith later told Compton police that Garcia had assaulted her. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the police report, the two had a stormy lunch at a San Pedro 
restaurant. They ordered seven glasses of wine and, after an argument, each 
tossed a drink in the other's face. 
</P>
<P>
 They then returned to the judge's chambers and, according to the report, "had 
an argument over victim's past relationship with a Los Angeles police officer, 
which produced a daughter. . . . Victim said Judge Garcia pushed her against 
book shelves . . . grabbed her by the throat, putting fingers in her mouth and 
said: 'You're messing with the wrong person.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After Compton police filed the report, Smith dropped her complaint and 
prosecutors refused to file charges, Lt. Joe Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told her she should file charges against him, and she agreed but later 
changed her mind," Montes said. "She'd say: 'I can't do that to his career. It 
would ruin him.' She just cared for him too much." 
</P>
<P>
 The two ended up reconciling and had been seeing each other steadily since the 
incident, her sister said. But the relationship continued to be tumultuous, 
Montes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no respect for the man," said Montes, who co-managed the El Arco Iris 
restaurant with her sister. "He didn't respect his wife. He didn't respect my 
sister. He didn't respect himself." 
</P>
<P>
 But attorneys were impressed with Garcia because of his conscientious 
approach, said Craig Hum, a deputy district attorney who has argued a number of 
cases before Garcia. Hum thought so highly of the judge that he asked Garcia to 
swear him in after he passed the Hawaii Bar exam. Hum was extremely surprised 
when he heard that the judge had been involved in an altercation with a woman 
in his chambers last August. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was incredibly fair . . . that's what I was impressed with," Hum said.  
</P>
<P>
 Garcia rarely missed civic functions or social gatherings with the South 
Central Bar Assn., friends said. But Garcia, who presided over criminal 
preliminary hearings and has been a judge in Compton for seven years, always 
appeared alone. 
</P>
<P>
 If Garcia's case reaches the stage of a preliminary hearing and he is charged 
with a felony, he will be suspended, without loss of salary, while the case is 
pending, according to officials at the state Commission on Judicial 
Performance. If he is convicted and the conviction stands under appeal, Garcia 
will be removed from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 The night of the accident, Garcia and Smith had dinner and drinks at a 
Pasadena restaurant, Montes said, and were probably on their way back to 
Smith's apartment. Montes plans to raise Smith's two older children and the 
younger one will live with her father. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia left the accident scene and waited so long before contacting police 
because "he went into shock . . . he was totally out of it," said his attorney, 
Robin J. Yanes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He saw her lying in the street and her head was in pieces . . . it was a 
horrendous scene," Yanes said. "He went into a state of shock and just wandered 
off." 
</P>
<P>
 After about an hour, Garcia called a friend from a phone booth but was 
incoherent and "could only say: 'Help me,' over and over," Yanes said. The 
friend "got out of him what happened" and they went to the LAPD's Northeast 
station, where Garcia turned himself in. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, who grew up in East Los Angeles, was raised by his mother, who worked 
two jobs as a domestic and a file clerk, after his father died when he was 
young. His path to the bench had a number of unusual stops along the way. He 
attended four colleges before graduating from Cal State Los Angeles with a 
degree in music. 
</P>
<P>
 He pursued his interest in music, playing the trumpet in Latin nightclubs, 
then attended graduate school in library science at UC Berkeley. He worked as a 
librarian before enrolling in law school at the University of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 He transferred to USC and received his law degree in 1976. After eight years 
in his own practice, he was appointed to the bench by then-Gov. George 
Deukmejian.  
</P>
<P>
 Garcia is up for reelection in June but is unopposed.  
</P>

POSTAL OPENING CANCELED; MAIL: NORTHRIDGE QUAKE POSTPONES USE OF NEW PROCESSING 
CENTER IN VALENCIA. DAMAGE RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER SITE WAS ADEQUATELY 
PREPARED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Erected on a hilltop in Valencia, it stood to be a paragon of the newly 
efficient U.S. Postal Service -- a $123-million mail processing complex, built 
under budget, in time and with all the latest machinery to sort letters at 
lightning speed. 
</P>
<P>
 But three months shy of the planned opening, the Northridge earthquake twisted 
and severely damaged sections of the 750,000-square-foot structure in Valencia, 
and left ridges running along the asphalt parking lot like tiny speed bumps. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage to the facility, which was built on a backfill, raises questions about 
whether the land was adequately prepared and inspected. No one knows for sure 
when the facility will open, leaving uncertainties for about 2,000 workers who 
were to relocate there from an old, cramped mail operation in Van Nuys that has 
been straining to process an ever-increasing avalanche of mail deposited in 
northern Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, postal officials said, the earthquake damage is likely to 
cost several million dollars. And even if repairs can be made quickly, they 
said, the facility still probably will not be opened until early next year 
because it will take that long for Caltrans to repair all the quake damage on 
the Golden State and Simi Valley freeways. Both freeways are key arteries 
linking the San Fernando Valley to the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the federal government, Newhall Land & Farming Co. -- which sold it 
the 65-acre site -- and contractors are waiting for two geological analyses 
that are expected to shed light on what happened and what fixes can be made. 
Those reports are due out soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's finger-pointing going on all over the place," said Ken Emerald, 
president of the American Postal Workers Union local that represents 1,500 
workers at the Van Nuys facility. He added: "Evidently, there is talk of 
litigation about who is responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Regan, the Postal Service's manager for mail processing in California, 
said no one was being blamed for anything yet. But Regan also did not rule out 
the possibility of legal action. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, we could run a lot of 'what ifs,' " Regan said, adding that 
she was eager to see the reports. "All I know is I walked through the building 
with a hard hat, and I could clearly see that nothing in the building 
collapsed." 
</P>
<P>
 Citing safety concerns, the postal agency would not allow reporters inside the 
facility. But from the outside, cracks were visible on facades. There was 
yellow tape around entrances, and in the truck dock area, thick sections of 
concrete were torn, exposing metal reinforcements in the walls. Last week, 
workers were boarding up those gaping sections and securing water pipe joints 
underground. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hardest hit areas were the facility's two-story administration 
building and an adjoining employee cafeteria and locker room, which sank six to 
eight inches into the soil and also twisted four inches. Engineers said those 
structures were apparently built on relatively deep backfill -- which is land 
that was excavated and refilled -- that may have settled during the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Roberts, an engineer with Pasadena-based Jacobs Engineering Group, said 
the Valencia postal structure withstood the earthquake just as it was built to. 
But he said, "If you have some deeper failures in the soil, you're undermining 
the building." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts, whose firm designed the Valencia postal complex and administered its 
construction, was at a loss as to why the parts of the building sank and 
twisted. "If you have some deep canyons full of sand," he said, "even if 
properly compacted, there's a reasonable possibility you're going to get some 
additional movement" in an earthquake as violent as the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The postal facility was built on a cliff-like area about a mile west of the 
Golden State Freeway, just north of California 126 and close to Six Flags Magic 
Mountain park in Valencia. Newhall Land, which sold the land to the Postal 
Service for $26.8 million, prepared the site by excavating 6 million yards of 
earth and refilling the valleys around it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Horn, executive vice president of Sikand Engineering Associates, a Van 
Nuys firm hired by Newhall to prepare the site, said all of the soil and 
geology work complied with Los Angeles County standards. Sikand completed the 
grading in late 1991. "We did everything from the county perspective," Horn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works said that county 
inspectors, while they approved grading plans before the work was done, never 
gave final certification to the postal project because of insufficient reports. 
Horn said that certification was subsequently not pursued because the federal 
government, which is exempt from county requirements, was eager to begin 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 David Sponn, the Postal Service's construction project manager for mail 
processing facilities, said he did not know whether the federal government 
signed off on the land before building the Valencia complex. Sponn, who works 
out of Memphis, Tenn., visited the Valencia facility two weeks after the 
earthquake. "I was surprised at some of the damage, but it didn't appear to be 
life-threatening," he said. "I was glad nobody got hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 At 4:31 a.m. when the earthquake hit, there was a crew of 30 people working in 
the Valencia facility on bulk mail operations, which had been transferred ahead 
of time to ease the workload in Van Nuys. Those employees were in a 
350,000-square-foot workroom, which was not affected much by the quake, 
although a two-mile-long overhead conveyor system appears to have had some 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The conveyors were part of a sophisticated assembly of machinery that made the 
Valencia facility the most technologically advanced among about 300 mail 
processing centers in the nation. Among the equipment at the Valencia plant 
were 10 high-speed canceling machines, which could cancel 35,000 stamps an 
hour, while at the same time sorting letters by scanning bar codes. The 
20-year-old facility in Van Nuys had only two cancellation machines that 
operated at half that speed and without sorting capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were bursting out of the seams," said David Moffitt, an official of 
National Postal Mailhandlers Local 303, another union at Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 When Moffitt started work at Van Nuys in 1981, the operation wasn't nearly as 
cramped. But mail volume grew 10% annually over the last decade before tapering 
off after the recession hit in 1991. Currently about 5 million to 7 million 
pieces of mail are dropped off every day in the San Fernando Valley and 
surrounding areas. Postal workers in Van Nuys must process and sort these 
letters, mostly in one night, so they can be trucked to airports and other 
postal offices for delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1980s, the Postal Service chose Valencia for a new mail processing 
center, bypassing sites in Burbank, Granada Hills and Pacoima. The decision was 
made on considerations of cost, land availability and forecasts for population 
growth in the Santa Clarita Valley, said Al Iniguez, the Van Nuys plant 
manager. Now, he said, some of the new canceling machines in Valencia will be 
brought to Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a little tight, but we'll survive," said Iniguez, who like many other 
postal managers assumed his position in the fall of 1992, when new Postmaster 
General Marvin Runyon began a big efficiency push at the beleaguered agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valencia facility was to be a model of the new, slimmed-down Postal 
Service, but last week, Runyon, a 37-year veteran of Ford Motor Co., flew to 
San Francisco to hear reports about the badly damaged Valencia plant. Runyon 
declined to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerald, the union official, said he and others thought the Valencia facility 
was ill-conceived to begin with because it was 20 miles north of the main 
service area of the San Fernando Valley. Despite the distance, Postal Service 
officials figured they could make up the lost time with increased automation, 
and many trial runs had been successful. But that was before the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Many postal workers at the Van Nuys plant seemed to take the news of the 
delayed move in stride. Many did not want to make the move in the first place 
because they had built their lives in the Valley and were not looking forward 
to the longer drive to work. 
</P>
<P>
 But other employees were clearly disappointed.

VIOLATIONS BY SVORINICH'S OFFICE ALLEGED; POLITICS: EX-AIDES SAY CAMPAIGN 
CONTRIBUTIONS WERE ILLEGALLY ACCEPTED AT A CITY FACILITY. COUNCILMAN DENIES THE 
CHARGE BUT ADMITS THAT SOME FUNDS HAD GONE UNREPORTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On at least three occasions last year, campaign contributions to Los Angeles 
Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr. were brought to his San Pedro district office 
despite a ban on such political activity in city offices, five former Svorinich 
aides have told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, one of the aides says that last year he saw Svorinich with an 
envelope of campaign checks -- from Ft. Worth, Tex., contributors -- totaling 
thousands of dollars. Until recently, Svorinich's office denied that his 
campaign received the funds. But after inquiries by The Times, the 
contributions were reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Svorinich declined to be interviewed on the allegations of contributions being 
accepted at his office. But through a spokesman he denied the charges. As for 
the contributions from Ft. Worth, Svorinich's office said the checks were 
overlooked earlier because some campaign finance records were briefly lost 
after the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The claims by the former Svorinich aides are the latest controversy to dog the 
freshman councilman, whose district stretches from San Pedro to Watts. His 
office has been in upheaval with the resignations, voluntarily or otherwise, of 
seven of 15 staff members since Jan. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, interviews with former staffers have underscored a deep rift 
within Svorinich's office. That rift, the ex-aides claim, was fueled by their 
concern that campaign contribution laws were ignored repeatedly in Svorinich's 
office, even after he and his staff were briefed on the laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Two former staffers, Brian Hannon and Lillia Fernandez, say they saw an 
envelope of political contributions accepted at Svorinich's San Pedro office in 
December -- months after he has claimed that such illegal practices were 
halted. The person delivering the checks, which came from a San Pedro 
fund-raising dinner, has confirmed that she dropped them off at Svorinich's 
office in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Former staffer Kate Acuna says she saw another aide accept an envelope of 
contributions for Svorinich at the San Pedro office, also around the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 And former Chief Deputy John Vidivich said he saw a San Pedro supporter and 
fund-raiser for Svorinich drop off an envelope to the district office in 
October when Svorinich was present. It is unclear if the envelope was accepted 
at the office, Vidivich said, because he told Svorinich and the supporter to 
take their activity elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, former senior consultant John Barbieri said he saw Svorinich at his 
San Pedro office with an envelope containing about a dozen checks, ranging from 
$50 to $500. Barbieri said the incident occurred after Svorinich dined with a 
San Pedro supporter and an official for Union Pacific Resources Co., which 
recently sold the Port of Long Beach 725 waterfront acres that figured in a 
lawsuit with the Port of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbieri said all but one of the checks were from people living in Ft. Worth, 
which is headquarters for Union Pacific Resources. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Svorinich denied any improper political activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "These allegations are not true," he said. "If these former employees have any 
proof in regard to these ridiculous allegations, then they should take it to 
the proper and legal channels to air them rather than the news media." 
</P>
<P>
 To date, only Vidivich has spoken to city ethics officials. But Barbieri and 
several others have said they intend to do so. Meanwhile, ethics officials -- 
as is their practice -- have refused to confirm or deny any investigation of 
Svorinich or his office. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks ago, Svorinich acknowledged that an aide, Rene DuKet, improperly 
accepted an envelope of contributions at the San Pedro office. But he said the 
incident took place just after he took office in July -- before DuKet and other 
staff knew the act was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot tell you strongly enough that that sort of action is not condoned in 
this office," Svorinich said three weeks ago. He added that the incident with 
DuKet prompted him to ask city ethics officials to hold a special Aug. 3 
briefing on the law for his staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Former staffers Hannon and Fernandez, however, say that months after that 
briefing, DuKet accepted an envelope with campaign contributions at the San 
Pedro office. The two said the checks were brought in shortly after a Dec. 6 
fund-raiser for Svorinich that drew several dozen business owners -- each 
paying $125 -- to a San Pedro restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The account was confirmed by Lois Denzin, who delivered the checks from the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I delivered those checks to the office not knowing as an ordinary citizen 
that there was anything wrong," said Denzin, who works for a consulting firm 
that helped plan the event. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When told the contributions were delivered in December, Svorinich's spokesman, 
Tom Kruesopon, said the council office had erred in earlier claiming that the 
checks arrived before the August ethics briefing. Kruesopon could not explain, 
however, why such a briefing would have been requested months before any 
questionable incident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, DuKet said she accepted an envelope of contributions just after 
Svorinich took office because she did not know the practice was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, DuKet said she accepted an envelope from Denzin in December because 
she did not know its contents. "When I looked at the envelope, I found out it 
was checks," DuKet said.  
</P>
<P>
 On another occasion around the holidays, according to former aide Acuna, 
Denzin delivered another envelope containing contributions to the San Pedro 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Denzin said she handed the checks to a Svorinich staffer outside the office. 
</P>
<P>
 Former top deputy Vidivich, meanwhile, said that in October Svorinich was 
present when contributions were brought to the office by San Pedro attorney 
Carmen Trutanich, a prominent supporter and fund-raiser of the councilman's. 
"(Trutanich) brought in an envelope with campaign contributions. . . . Rudy was 
there to meet him," Vidivich said. "And I said, this belongs elsewhere, or 
something to that effect. Take it outside. And that was it. I went back to my 
office." 
</P>
<P>
 Trutanich denied bringing political contributions to Svorinich's office. 
"Anybody who tells you that is a flat-out liar," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban on accepting campaign contributions at a council office is designed to 
avoid the appearance of a link "between the office itself . . . and the 
campaign process," said Larry Berg of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics 
at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Former aide Barbieri said he saw Svorinich in the San Pedro office last summer 
or early fall with the envelope of campaign checks from Ft. Worth. He said he 
saw the checks after Svorinich held a dinner meeting with Ed Gladish, director 
of government relations for Union Pacific Resources, and Trutanich, whose law 
firm had done work for the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Trutanich said he remembered a lunch with Svorinich, Gladish and Joe Burton, a 
partner in Trutanich's law firm. But he could not recall the date and insisted 
it had nothing to do with contributions from Union Pacific Resources. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gladish recalled a lunch meeting and making contributions -- with others from 
Union Pacific Resources -- to Svorinich.  
</P>
<P>
 When first asked about the checks from Ft. Worth residents, officials in 
Svorinich's office said they did not know about the contributions. But when 
asked last week -- after Gladish confirmed the checks -- Svorinich's spokesman 
said the money had been received and would be reported Tuesday. The report 
shows $1,400 from Union Pacific Resources and a half-dozen of its employees.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; WALTERS 
SUGGESTS CUTTING LIBRARY'S WEEKDAY HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move that has angered the librarians union, Councilwoman Rita Walters 
said Wednesday that the cash-strapped Central Library should consider reducing 
its weekday hours to remain open on Sundays.  
</P>
<P>
 In a motion presented to the council, Walters said that Sunday hours at the 
library are an important resource for working people and children, who often 
find it difficult to come on other days. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that private funding for Sunday hours may soon run out, and arguing 
that resources should not be drained from branch libraries, Walters said that 
"all available budget-neutral options" should be considered.  
</P>
<P>
 However, the librarians union staunchly opposes making Sundays part of their 
regular workweek. Now, Sunday duty is voluntary and merits time-and-a-half pay. 
</P>
<P>
 The union argues that at a time when staffing in the library system as a whole 
has been severely cut back, Sunday hours are a luxury the city cannot afford. 
If librarians work Sundays, they should get double-time pay, the union says. 
"(The library) is placing the burden on the employees to provide a service when 
the resources are not there for that service," said Rosalie Preston, a vice 
president of the librarians union. 
</P>
<P>
 But Howard Gantman, Walters' deputy, said librarians should be willing to work 
Sundays, as do many other city employees.

 Straying Spouses 101: We recently mentioned the tale of the hotel vice 
president who came up with the idea of sending thank you cards to the homes of 
its guests -- an idea that backfired when he received responses from some 
puzzled (and angry) spouses who had never stayed at the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 That story brought a note from Billie Long, who recalled a similar disaster at 
Pierce College where she worked as a secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the late 1960s . . . our assistant dean decided to try to determine why 
there was such a high attrition rate for evening classes," she writes. "He sent 
out cards to all of the students who had registered for an evening class and 
then dropped it shortly after the semester began. He included a return card 
requesting feedback . . . if it was class content, the instructor, personal 
reasons, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 "He soon started to receive telephone calls from very puzzled husbands and 
wives. They didn't understand where he got the idea that their spouse had 
dropped their classes. Several remarked that their spouse had perfect 
attendance. . . . The dean promptly decided that it was not a very good idea 
and wondered how many marriages he had inadvertently broken up."

 Speaking of marital combat . . . "I've only been married two years and so far 
I haven't needed anything like the 'Self-Defense' course that you (The Times) 
advertised," writes Tad Daley.

 That's cold: Little did the tiny L.A. suburb of Paramount know that it would 
be dragged into the Harding-Kerrigan affair. But there it is -- a cartoon in 
Newsweek that shows Kerrigan about to be run down on the ice. Her assailant is 
Harding, who is driving Paramount's most famous product -- the Zamboni ice 
refinisher.

 Press releases we never finish: "Northern California boasts the Golden Gate 
Bridge, the Mendocino Coast and the Wine Country. Southern California has 
towering palm trees, Venice Beach and Hollywood. But what unites these two

 A fraternity of sorts: After reading a Times story about the generation gap 
among criminals, a Dallas resident phoned to thank this newspaper for 
mentioning an old friend, imprisoned kidnaper Robert Dacy. The caller said the 
article enabled him to get in touch with Dacy at the state prison in Tehachapi, 
40 years after they had lost contact. And when had he last seen Dacy?

 While employed as a U-2 spy plane pilot for the CIA, Francis Gary Powers was 
shot down over the Soviet Union in 1960, causing an international furor. Freed 
in exchange for a Soviet spy, Powers eventually settled in L.A., where he was 
killed in 1977 in a helicopter crash while working as a traffic and weather 
reporter for KNBC-TV (Channel 4) news.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUTH GATE; THREE HELD 
IN ROBBERY, SLAYING OF WOMAN, 82 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three men have been arrested on suspicion of robbing and killing an 
82-year-old woman in her South Gate home this month.  
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Luis Sosa, 32, of Bell and Carlos Martinez Medrano, 35, who had no 
permanent address, told police they killed Joaquina Marie Linfor and ransacked 
her apartment, Sgt. Ken Gallatin of the Sheriff's Department said.Information 
discovered after Medrano's arrest Monday led investigators to Pedro Concepcion 
Garcia, 35, of Bell, who was arrested Tuesday morning at Liberty Boulevard 
Elementary School, where he worked part time as a janitor, Gallatin said.  
</P>
<P>
 Linfor, a onetime queen of the South Gate Azalea Festival and an active 
community member, lived next door to Liberty Boulevard school. She tended 
flower beds on the grounds and had keys to the property.  
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor found Linfor's body Feb. 2 in the living room of her modest South 
Gate apartment, lying face-down with her hands and feet bound. Investigators 
said she died of asphyxiation, but would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The suspects) were under the belief that she had a lot of money and was an 
easy mark," Gallatin said. "She was an old lady that lived on Social Security 
and she didn't have anything at all." No other arrests are expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberty Boulevard school officials plan to place a memorial plaque for Linfor 
in a flower bed she tended on the campus.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; THIRD OF 
BUSINESSES FOUND NOT PAYING LICENSE TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than a third of the businesses in the city of Los Angeles are not paying 
business license taxes, costing the city treasury an estimated $66 million a 
year, city Controller Rick Tuttle reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle's office estimated that there are about 66,000 businesses failing to 
pay the taxes.The controller estimated that the businesses owe an average of 
about $1,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle said in a letter to Mayor Richard Riordan that he supports a proposal 
to hire outside firms to track down the tax scofflaws -- paying a "bounty," or 
portion of back taxes they collect. The controller also called for the creation 
of a single identification number, so the city can check its tax payments 
against state and federal tax records. He also recommended that the state 
withhold services, as the city does, from businesses that do not pay taxes.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; MAN GETS 
LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE IN FATAL ARSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who helped kill a couple by locking them in a closet and setting it on 
fire was sentenced Wednesday to two consecutive life prison terms without 
possibility of parole.  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Florence-Marie Cooper, who had called it the 
most aggravated death penalty case she had encountered in more than 14 years, 
went along with the jury's recommendation in sentencing Lonnie Lewis, 33.Lewis 
and his half brother, Jerome Martin, 25, were convicted Sept. 20 of the murders 
of Lee Gottstein, 57, and Sylvia Davis, 45, who were burned beyond recognition 
in the closet of a four-unit apartment on South Orange Grove Avenue. The case 
was dubbed "Nightmare on Orange Grove." Angela Merritt, 33, was also forced 
into the closet but she escaped and staggered outside.  
</P>
<P>
 She was raped and shot and remains severely scarred from the burns. She 
testified during the trial that Gottstein and Davis had sold crack cocaine out 
of their apartment.  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors maintained that Lewis and Martin, who also was sentenced to two 
consecutive life terms without parole, were customers who returned to the 
apartment Jan. 31, 1989, to rob them.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: DOWNEY; MAN KILLS 
FRIEND, SELF IN ARGUMENT OVER WIFE 
</P>

<P>
 A 26-year-old Downey man, apparently suspicious that his wife was having an 
affair, gunned down a friend Tuesday night, then took his own life, 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricky Lawrence La Rue shot Anthony Fuentes, 29, nine times with a 
semiautomatic handgun after an argument in La Rue's front yard involving the 
two men and La Rue's wife, Kimberly, 22.Then La Rue apparently turned the gun 
on himself, said Downey Police Detective Gary Morrow. 
</P>
<P>
 All three worked at Modern Equipment Systems, a South Gate company that 
manufactures sheet metal, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the shooting, La Rue telephoned Fuentes, also of Downey, to confront 
him about his suspicions, detectives said. La Rue and his wife were arguing 
when Fuentes showed up at their home in the 9200 block of Guatemala Avenue. 
Neighbors called police at 6:42 p.m. to report the argument. Officers arrived 
moments later to find Fuentes dead and La Rue with a gunshot wound to the head. 
He died about an hour later at Downey Community Hospital.

FAMILY OF AIRPLANE CRASH VICTIM AWARDED $1.8 MILLION; COURT: JUDGE ORDERS FAA 
TO PAY SURVIVORS OF FLIGHT ATTENDANT KILLED IN 1986 CERRITOS AIR COLLISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than seven years after the Cerritos air crash, the family of a Mexican 
flight attendant has been awarded $1.8 million in damages by a Los Angeles 
federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Robert M. Takasugi ordered the Federal Aviation 
Administration to pay the award to the mother, two younger sisters and two 
younger brothers of Patricia Trillo Lopez, the lead flight attendant on the 
Aeromexico jetliner that was struck by a small private plane Aug. 31, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Trillo and 81 other people died in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 The award was considerably higher than that received by the families of two 
other flight attendants who settled out of court with U.S. Justice Department 
attorneys, representing the FAA. Takasugi's decision, rendered more than a year 
after the trial ended, was based on his determination that Trillo was the sole 
support of her family and would have continued to play that role for many 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time she died, Trillo, 27, was living at home in Mexico City and 
providing her entire paycheck for the support of her family. She was supporting 
her mother, Esther Lopez Acosta, 50, her sisters Alejandra, 15, and Susana, 14, 
and her brothers Julio, 11, and Marco, 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time of her death, Patricia was the sole support of plaintiffs," 
Takasugi wrote in his decision. "She paid for many of the economic essentials, 
school supplies and clothes for her siblings. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Mexico, it is a common practice and respected tradition that employed 
adult children support their parents throughout their lives," Takasugi wrote. 
"The decedent adhered to this cultural precedence." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge noted that Trillo also shopped, prepared meals, provided 
transportation, earned extra money by tutoring neighborhood children in English 
and helped nurture and educate her younger siblings in their schoolwork and 
with "moral guidance." Her death caused "emotional and social difficulties 
which led to serious academic setbacks." 
</P>
<P>
 George F. Archer of Chicago, who represented Trillo's family, hailed 
Takasugi's decision. "The judge recognized there is a tradition and culture in 
Mexico that kids will continue to support their families after they've grown 
up," and that accounts for the large damage award, Archer said in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department attorney Steven J. Riegel said: "It certainly is a generous 
award. Our economist said he had never heard of lifetime support for a parent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judge made those findings after listening to the family and finding that 
Mrs. Acosta could reasonably expect support for the rest of her life," Riegel 
said. "It was a sympathetic close family." 
</P>
<P>
 Riegel said that the Justice Department is reviewing the decision to determine 
if it should be appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Other sources said the government is unlikely to appeal the decision because 
it has lost four of the five Cerritos crash cases it asked the U.S. 9th Circuit 
Court of Appeals to review. 
</P>
<P>
 Riegel said cases brought on behalf of the families of two other flight 
attendants who died in the crash "were settled for lower amounts," but he 
declined to say how much. Riegel said negotiations are pending in the case of 
the other flight attendant who died in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Riegel said 50 cases have been settled, 15 have gone to trial and 
about a dozen are pending, including two scheduled to go to trial this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage cases have been conducted in the aftermath of a 1989 trial where 
another federal judge, David V. Kenyon, found the FAA and William Kramer, the 
pilot of the Piper aircraft who also perished in the crash, equally responsible 
for the crash. Aeromexico was found to have no liability.

CALTECH PROFESSOR DIES AFTER ATTACKING WIFE, SETTING HOUSE ABLAZE; VIOLENCE: 
DAUGHTER SAYS SHE SAW HER FATHER LIGHTING MATCHES AS FAMILY ESCAPED THE FIRE. 
MOTIVE IS UNKNOWN.

<P>
 A Caltech professor, apparently armed with an ax, bludgeoned his wife early 
Wednesday, then set his La Canada Flintridge home on fire, perishing in the 
blaze, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan J.A. van de Snepscheut's badly burned body was found in the remains of a 
bedroom of his one-story house in the 4700 block of Hayman Avenue by 
firefighters who responded to the 2:39 a.m. blaze, authorities said. His wife, 
Terre, who escaped the burning house, remained in fair but stable condition 
late Wednesday at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Angie McLaughlin said the wife told 
authorities she was asleep when the attack occurred, and recalled only that she 
was awakened about 2:30 a.m. "when her husband struck her with some type of 
object." 
</P>
<P>
 "The object has not been positively identified, but detectives have removed 
(an) ax from the scene as possible evidence," the deputy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the motive behind the apparent attack is unclear. Neighbors 
described the couple as smart, friendly and involved in community activities 
and the local Girl Scout troop. None reported hearing any fights or disputes in 
the days before the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's three children, ages 14, 12 and 10, were in the house at the time 
the blaze erupted, officials said, but it was unknown whether they witnessed 
the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Fire Department Battalion Chief Jim Crawford said the elder 
daughter led the younger siblings to safety, then ran back into the house to 
look for her father. When she found him lighting matches, the girl told 
investigators, she fled. 
</P>
<P>
 The daughter suffered a minor case of smoke inhalation and was treated at the 
scene, Crawford said. Neighbors said the children are staying with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Van de Snepscheut, 41, an associate professor at Caltech, taught introductory 
and graduate courses in the computer science department, Caltech officials 
said. A Dutch citizen born in Oosterhout, the Netherlands, he had taught at the 
university since 1989. He received his master's degree from Eindoven University 
of Technology in 1977 and his Ph.D. from the same university in 1983, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Van de Snepscheut was the founder of two microcomputer companies in the 
Netherlands. His work focused mainly on developing methods to fix bugs, or 
errors, in computer software programs. He published a book, "What Computing Is 
All About," in 1993 and thanked his wife and family "for their love and 
patience in the past years" in the last sentence of the text. 
</P>
<P>
 His students, stunned by the news of his death, said he had always been calm 
and good-humored in class, and had given no sign Tuesday that he might be under 
duress.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of respect for him. He was a really good professor, and his 
class was the only class I went to regularly," said Huy Le, 18, a computer 
science major who was one of 30 students in Van de Snepscheut's sophomore 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Anthony Molinaro, 20, was equally mystified. 
</P>
<P>
 "This must have been about his personal life," Molinaro said, "because his 
professional life really seemed together."

 Yaroslavsky, who has already raised more than $700,000 in campaign 
contributions, is considered the front-runner for the job being vacated by 
retiring Supervisor Ed Edelman. The mayor's support is nonetheless considered a 
coup for the councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a critical endorsement," Yaroslavsky, 45, said. "No other endorsement 
means more." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said he supports Yaroslavsky because he admires his "record as a 
fiscal watchdog" and because of the councilman's support for the mayor's plan 
to put more police on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zev has been one of the city's most tenacious and effective protectors of 
taxpayer money," Riordan said before signing Yaroslavsky's nomination petition 
at a news conference on the steps of City Hall. "Los Angeles will benefit from 
his tremendous skills and talents." 
</P>
<P>
 City Hall insiders and political consultants said Riordan's endorsement 
improves Yaroslavsky's stock in the San Fernando Valley, where Riordan won 
strong support in his mayoral victory in June. Edelman's 3rd Supervisorial 
District covers much of the Valley, while Yaroslavsky has represented a largely 
Westside constituency since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mayor's popularity is at an all-time high and the endorsement is very 
important," said Allan Hoffenblum, a Los Angeles-based political consultant who 
has managed several City Hall campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Yaroslavsky said that because of the mayor's increasing 
popularity, he believes Riordan's endorsement will help him with voters 
throughout the district, not just in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline to enter the race is March 11. The primary is June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 But in making the endorsement, Riordan is also expected to benefit by gaining 
an important ally in Yaroslavsky, regardless of whether he wins the seat or 
loses and remains on the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 As chairman of the council's Budget Committee, Yaroslavsky's support is 
crucial for the approval of Riordan's annual budget proposal, which he is 
expected to submit in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "Win or lose, the mayor is going to have to deal with Zev in some capacity or 
another," political consultant Paul Clark said. "So, from a purely political 
standpoint, it makes as much sense as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The only other declared candidate in the race is Don Wallace, a retired Los 
Angeles County Fire Department captain and Edelman deputy, who has painted 
himself as a political outsider and reformer. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he admitted that Riordan's support is a boost for Yaroslavsky's 
candidacy, he called the endorsement "just another part of the power structure 
lining up behind the business-as-usual crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace has raised about $10,000 in campaign contributions.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CLASSES RESUME AT 
PARAMOUNT HIGH AFTER RACIAL FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 Students returned to classes under tight security at Paramount High School on 
Wednesday for the first time since smoldering racial tensions erupted into a 
melee Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 Six Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies with metal detectors were assigned 
to the campus to check students for weapons, but none were found, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The half day of classes scheduled Wednesday ended without a disturbance, 
school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Michele Lawrence said the school will only be open for half a day today 
to give students more time to cool off.  
</P>
<P>
 Administrators will decide today whether regular schedules will resume Friday, 
Lawrence said. The campus had been closed Monday and Tuesday for the 
Presidents' Day holiday and a previously planned day when only the staff was to 
report to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Students were expected to spend the rest of the week discussing racial 
problems with teachers and peer counselors. Extra administrators were assigned 
to the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five students have been suspended for undetermined times for their 
involvement in Friday's fight. Some may be expelled, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident was apparently sparked by a fight between a Latino student and a 
black student earlier in the week.  
</P>
<P>
 Paramount Unified School District officials confirmed that there had been 
tensions between the high school's 2,300 Latino students and its 500 black 
students earlier in the week and said Friday's brawl involved 30 to 50 students 
in the initial fight.  
</P>
<P>
 The melee began near the end of the lunch period, when someone pulled a fire 
alarm and a group of students turned over a couple of trash cans, school 
officials said. Others started running around the campus and refused to go back 
to class. Sheriff's deputies were called, but some students refused to leave 
the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents and students are very frightened, and they're saying tensions are 
continuing to build," said school board member Richard Caldwell, a former 
principal at Paramount. "Unless the administration and the teachers watch this 
very carefully, there's always a chance some student's going to be injured."  
</P>
<P>
 Some parents refused to let their children return to class Wednesday. At a 
school board meeting Tuesday night, parent Diana Torres complained that last 
week's brawl caught district administrators off-guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say it's been escalating for years, yet they're not ready for it," 
Torres said. Parents are meeting at the high school Monday to discuss problems. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents who escorted their children to school urged them to call home if 
problems erupted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today was my daughter's birthday. I was going to make her stay home," parent 
Jose Cota said after dropping off his 17-year-old daughter. "It's crazy with 
all of this going on." 
</P>
<P>
 One African American student made light of the problems at the school, but 
said many of his black friends are not taking any chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't want to get jumped," junior Terence Grayson, 17, said. 
</P>
<P>
 A district spokeswoman confirmed that the number of absences was higher than 
usual: 363 students were absent from their third-period class Wednesday, 160 
more than on a typical day at the high school.

MCSORLEY SUSPENDED AS KINGS GET 0-0 TIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You know things are a little shaky when the first Kings scoreless tie since 
Oct. 18, 1977 is cause for cheers all around at the Forum, at least those left 
from the sellout crowd of 16,005. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, by failing to score against the Dallas Stars, the Kings picked up a point 
on Wednesday night in the Western Conference, pulling within six of the San 
Jose Sharks for the eighth and final playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Double shutouts, anyone? 
</P>
<P>
 For King goaltender Robb Stauber, it was his first NHL shutout as he faced 34 
shots. Dallas goaltender Andy Moog was flawless as he made 39 saves. But the 
Kings (21-32-7) were lucky to escape overtime without losing in final minute, 
which had happened three consecutive times in the last month. They had lost 
five consecutive games before Wednesday's tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas suffered a major loss when defenseman Mark Tinordi went crashing into 
the end boards and broke his left femur at 2:11 of the third period. Tinordi 
and King forward John Druce, chasing the loose puck behind the Stars' net, 
appeared to lock skates and Druce had his hand on Tinordi's back before he 
smacked into the boards leg first.  
</P>
<P>
 There was a 15-minute delay and Tinordi was carried off on a stretcher and 
taken to Centinela Hospital in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, the Kings suffered a setback of their own off the ice when NHL senior 
vice president Brian Burke suspended defenseman Marty McSorley for four games 
and fined him $500 after an eye-scratching incident against the Sharks' Bob 
Errey on Saturday in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 McSorley, who already missed Monday's game, will return to the lineup at home 
against Montreal on Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 No one among the Kings took the suspension quietly. That is, other than 
McSorley, who declined comment. Kings General Manager Nick Beverley, even hours 
after the verdict, was visibly upset and criticized Burke and the Sharks. 
</P>
<P>
 The ever-increasing bitterness between the Kings and the NHL and the Kings and 
the Sharks seemed far more interesting than the game against the Stars. 
Beverley said he thought Burke had made up his mind even before Wednesday's 
telephone hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It (the tape) is very inconclusive," Beverley said. "Obviously Mr. Burke felt 
very much different. It's a major bone of contention between the NHL and our 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marty was very good in stating his position. He's says he's no angel. But 
he's never been known as a guy who would gouge someone's eye. If he wanted to 
do something, he would have beat the living hell out of the guy. He was trying 
to restrain himself, attempting to avert a (possible) game misconduct. He was 
very aware of everything he was doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Burke, reached Wednesday night in New York at the Ranger-Bruin game, refused 
to respond to the points raised by the Kings, saying: "The simple fact is that 
the video tape is quite conclusive and crystal clear. And I find any contention 
to the contrary to be bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're going to take the position the tape is inconclusive, I'd view it 
if I were you and you'd be able to see it isn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Why four games? 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had one eye gouge this season. He (McSorley) is a repeat offender. He's 
been suspended at least three other times. With Chris Chelios, the action was 
not similar but the offense was equally serious." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is what bothered the Kings. During the telephone hearing, Burke also 
referred to the recent incident in which Chicago defenseman Chelios gouged the 
eye of Vancouver Canuck defenseman Dana Murzyn and received a four-game 
suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one of the things that's a contentious issue," Beverley said. "Some 
prejudice there. He (Burke) kept bringing up Chelios. Our response was that 
each case should be judged on its own merits. . . . What are we worried about, 
justice for Marty McSorley or protecting Chris Chelios because he got four 
games." 
</P>
<P>
 Beverley took issue with the Sharks, too, saying the team played up the 
incident, using a telestrater to highlight any actions by McSorley.

NHL ROUNDUP; ROOKIE ARNOTT SCORES 2 FOR OILERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rookie Jason Arnott scored only 49 seconds into the game Wednesday, then added 
another goal to power the Oilers to a 6-3 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs 
at Edmonton, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnott, a 19-year-old center, slipped behind the Toronto defense and banged 
home Zdeno Ciger's pass from behind the net. 
</P>
<P>
 He then scored the game-winning goal 53 seconds into the third period when 
Ciger, who had four assists, sent him in alone on goal. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 7, Detroit 2 -- Defenseman Scott Stevens had a goal and two assists 
at Detroit, where the Devils ended a seven-game road winless streak. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey was 0-3-4 in its previous seven road games. 
</P>
<P>
 Goalie Chris Terreri made 30 saves as he extended his unbeaten streak to five 
games (4-0-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit's three-game winning streak was snapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 3, San Jose 1 -- Eric Desjardins had a goal and an assist at Montreal 
as the Canadiens continued their domination of the Sharks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadiens are 6-0-2 against the Sharks since San Jose joined the NHL for 
the 1991-92 season, including a 4-0 record at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 6, New York Rangers 3 -- Dimitri Kvartalnov scored twice and Adam Oates 
extended his point streak to eight games at New York with a goal and two 
assists for the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Casey extended his unbeaten streak to 10 games (8-0-2) by stopping 23 
shots.

COSTLY ERRORS SPOIL DUCKS' 'HOMECOMING'; HOCKEY: NEW CENTER LEBEAU, HOWEVER, 
SHOWS FLASHES OF BRILLIANCE DURING 4-2 LOSS TO SABRES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a night that marked a homecoming for a handful of Mighty Ducks and a debut 
for center Stephan Lebeau, some of the Ducks left Memorial Auditorium with an 
extra tinge of disappointment Wednesday after a 4-2 loss to the Buffalo Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Ron Wilson grew up skating at the "Aud" as the old arena is known, 
jumping on the ice after his father's minor league teammates had finished 
practicing. Bob Corkum, the Ducks' leading scorer, used to play for the Sabres, 
as did defensemen Bill Houlder, Don McSween and Mark Ferner. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a game I wanted to win. It would have been nice," said McSween, who 
made several goal-saving defensive plays on a night when the defense made some 
crucial errors. He also was credited with the Ducks' second goal when his shot 
went in off the skate of Sabre defenseman Doug Bodger with the Ducks trailing, 
4-1, in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
 Lebeau, playing his first game since arriving in the trade that sent goalie 
Ron Tugnutt to Montreal Sunday, wasn't on the ice for either Duck goal, but 
showed signs that he is going to create scoring opportunities -- and be in the 
right places defensively as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely, he's got good hands and good wheels," said Corkum, who played 
with LeBeau on the power play. "He created some chances around the net." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Ron Wilson was satisfied with Lebeau's game, but has cautioned that one 
player can't cure all the Ducks' offensive shortcomings, and that it will take 
awhile for Lebeau to mesh on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an adjustment for me," said Lebeau, who was playing only his third 
game since returning from a severely sprained right ankle. "I didn't play a lot 
over the last six weeks. I felt better as the game went on. I'm confident my 
best is ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the first practice I was nervous, today I was nervous. I think it's the 
normal thing you have to go through." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sabres played a hard-checking, physical game and capitalized on defensive 
coverage errors by the Ducks. Guy Hebert, now the Ducks' No. 1 goalie, allowed 
four goals for the second consecutive game even though he has allowed under 
three a game most of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made a couple of nice plays on our defensive mistakes and that was the 
difference," Wilson said. "Add into that that Guy didn't make the big save that 
can get you out of it, not that the goals were his fault. He only let in one 
bad goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Smehlik had a dominating game for the Sabres, assisting on three 
goals. Randy Wood, Derek Plante, Dale Hawerchuk and Petr Svooboda scored. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks' Terry Yake ended Buffalo goalie Grant Fuhr's shutout bid at 8:14 of 
the second, when he scored his 20th goal of the season.

 Georgia's flag will be removed from Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium because its 
design includes the Confederate battle emblem.

 The Atlanta-Fulton County Recreation Authority, which governs the facility, 
voted unanimously Wednesday to stop flying the state flag at the stadium, home 
of the Braves, where baseball will be played during the 1996 Summer Olympics.

 Charles Barkley was in court at East Rutherford, N.J., to defend himself 
against charges that he hit a fan at the Meadowlands Arena after a game last 
season. Dennis McKeever, 30, of Yonkers, N.Y., testified in Municipal Court 
that the Phoenix star struck him in the face with the back of his hand when he 
tried to shake his hand after the Suns defeated the New Jersey Nets on Dec. 8, 
1992. 
</P>

 A friend of McKeever's, James McCaffery, testified that perhaps Barkley was 
angry with him because he had been yelling at the player about his bald head

MORNING BRIEFING: OLIVER STONE WILL WANT RIGHTS TO LATEST CONSPIRACY THEORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a growing feeling that Michael Jordan will return to the NBA sooner 
than later. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackie Sherrod of the Dallas Morning News writes that he has a hunch Jordan 
is planning to return within a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "All that retirement bunk about Michael despairing of media attention and 
wishing to spend more time with family was just that. Bunk," Sherrod writes. 
</P>
<P>
 "A theory long held here is that NBA commish David Stern sternly advised, 
maybe demanded, Jordan to cool it for a year to let those gambling rumbles die 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll remember that so-called league investigation issued a clean bill 
immediately after Jordan's strange retirement announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jordan's farewell words didn't contain the usual words of reflection and 
appreciation; they seemed coated with considerable resentment." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Jordan: Basketball commentator Dick Vitale, who lives in Sarasota, Fla., 
took a day off recently to watch Jordan work out with the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the three-S man, baby," Vitale said. "He's super, he's scintillating and 
he's sensational." 
</P>
<P>
 Vitale said he thought Jordan had a chance to be a part-time player, but 
didn't know if the former Chicago Bulls star would accept that role. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: How old was Dick Button when he won an Olympic gold medal in 
men's figure skating at the 1948 St. Moritz Games? 
</P>
<P>
 In reverse: Former Olympic swimming champion Tom Jager, 29, is teaching 
swimming in Albuquerque to a group considerably older. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those receiving tips from Jager, who won five gold medals in three 
Olympics, are older than 70. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something I like to do," said Jager, living in Tijeras, N.M., and 
still in serious training. "You meet these people and you really enjoy them." 
</P>

 Bernice Whitacre, 75, is one of 70 in the class. She fractured four vertebrae 
in August, but returned to the pool as soon as she healed.

 "I decided to go with the name to generate immediate interest," Anderson said. 
"I don't want to make light of this to urge people to go out and injure their

 Wednesday's announcement calling off Bell Atlantic Corp.'s planned merger with 
Tele-Communications Inc. is another pothole on the way to the information 
superhighway, although whether it poses a major obstacle is unclear. Other 
recent developments of importance: CABLE REGULATION Feb. 22, 1994: Federal 
regulators vote unanimously to order a new round of cable television rate cuts. 
The new rules impose an overall 17% reduction -- an additional 7% on top of 
last year's 10% cut -- on cable operators. Bell Atlantic and TCI say the action 
doomed their deal, though others are skeptical. PARAMOUNT-VIACOM MERGER Sept. 
20, 1993: QVC's Barry Diller launches a hostile $9.5 billion offer for 
Paramount with backing from Liberty Media Corp. and its much larger affiliate, 
TCI. 
</P>
<P>
 Feb. 14, 1994: Viacom Inc. defeats QVC Network Inc. in the five-month battle 
to acquire Paramount Communications. INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY December, 1993: 
The Clinton Administration introduces the National Information Infrastructure 
Initiative, designed to link TV's, telephones and computers with high speed 
lines to facilitate the rapid exchange of pictures, sounds and words. Jan. 11, 
1994: Vice President Al Gore holds an information superhighway summit at UCLA 
with more than 2,000 communication industry executives in attendance, including 
TCI's John C. Malone and Bell Atlantic's Ray Smith, to discuss the 
multi-channel multimedia future. At the meeting, Gore said the Clinton 
Administration is willing to consider breaking down regulatory barriers to 
permit telephone and cable TV companies to compete in offering a broad array of 
interactive services. CABLE AND PHONE DEALS May 17, 1993: U.S. West purchases a 
25% ownership stake in Time Warner's entertainment and cable group for about 
$2.5 billion. Oct. 4, 1993: Nynex agrees to invest $1.2 billion in Viacom's bid 
for Paramount. Oct. 12, 1993: Bell Atlantic Corp. announce plans to acquire 
cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. in a deal valued at $33 billion. Dec. 7, 
1993: Cox Cable and Southwestern Bell announce a $4.9 billion joint venture to 
offer a wide range of video and other interactive services to the venture's own 
cable and phone customers. The Companies at a Glance

FACING THE FALLOUT; BROKEN ENGAGEMENT CHILLS POTENTIAL FOR DEALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tele-Communications Inc.'s withdrawal from its merger with Bell Atlantic Corp. 
casts a shadow over similar potential deals among cable, telephone and other 
communications companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, because TCI blamed the Federal Communications Commission, the merger 
collapse raises questions about the role of the federal government in the 
growing businesses of the Information Age. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts felt certain Wednesday that the TCI/Bell Atlantic breakup would cool 
the widespread enthusiasm for multimedia acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
 The collapse of the deal, valued at $33 billion, is a major personal setback 
for John Malone, TCI's visionary president and chief executive, and for Raymond 
Smith, the technologically astute chairman of the Philadelphia-based phone 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 But, analysts asked Wednesday evening, was it also bad news for other cable 
companies? 
</P>
<P>
 And does the fact that Bell Atlantic shareholders came to oppose the TCI deal 
mean that other large phone companies will be discouraged from mergers and 
acquisitions? 
</P>
<P>
 Other questions ask whether the FCC opposes mergers as a way for telephone, 
television and movie companies to gain the technology and distribution channels 
they need to enter the age of interactive, computerized television known as the 
information highway -- and whether the break up of TCI/Bell Atlantic will 
affect the pace of technological development as telephones, televisions and 
computers converge. 
</P>
<P>
 The answers begin with the fact that the TCI/Bell Atlantic deal was coming 
apart anyway. Some analysts speculated that Malone might be using the FCC as a 
scapegoat to back out of a deal that had gone sour because of growing 
opposition from institutional shareholders of both the cable company and Bell 
Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 That deal, announced Oct. 13, was due to be renegotiated or killed, analysts 
said, because Bell Atlantic's falling stock price and reversals for TCI had 
made the merger terms onerous for both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 But some analysts saw a warning to the FCC as well. They noted that the agency 
issued rules Tuesday mandating a 17% rate cut for cable companies -- an 
additional 7% cut on top of a 10% cut ordered last year -- and that cable 
companies objected, saying reduced revenue would hamper their ability to 
compete in the new communications era. 
</P>
<P>
 These analysts, noting that the new FCC rules do not take effect for 30 days, 
speculated that Malone's deal-breaking announcement was a "brush back pitch to 
the FCC," putting the agency on notice that it should change its rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday evening, FCC Chairman Reed Hundt denounced suggestions that the 
FCC's action had harmed the deal. He said the rate cut "did not in any way make 
the future of the cable industry more unsettled." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, cable company ambitions to bring telephone services to homes, along 
with television channels, have taken a blow because cable companies need 
cash-rich partners if they are to build new fiber-optic networks for such 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the key to Malone's sale of his company to Bell Atlantic in October. 
The 52-year-old Malone, who built Englewood, Colo.-based TCI into a 
communications powerhouse with $3.5 billion in revenue, had announced plans 
early last year to invest $2 billion in fiber lines so TCI could deliver 
telephone services. 
</P>
<P>
 But the investment markets were not encouraging his plans. TCI, like most 
cable companies, carries a large debt load, the residue of years of borrowing 
to lay out its networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors now are looking for cable companies to retire some of their debt and 
begin to show profits and pay dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, Malone sought a merger with Bell Atlantic, which, like most of the 
regional Bell operating companies, has enormous annual cash flow -- income of 
$1.4 billion plus depreciation of $2.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In the merger deal, Bell was to pay a multiple of TCI's cash flow. So the 
FCC's latest action could have affected the final price to TCI shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bell's shareholders were also balking at the prospect of their company 
paying out more than 220 million shares and diluting their ownership to acquire 
TCI. 
</P>
<P>
 Steady selling in recent months had driven Bell's stock price below a level it 
had guaranteed for the merger. 
</P>
<P>
 That opposition by Bell Atlantic shareholders could well be a signal to other 
phone company managers not to be so eager to pay generously to acquire liaisons 
with cable and other communications companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly, this deal was bigger than other phone cable hookups, such as US 
West's $2.5-billion investment in Time Warner's entertainment division. 
</P>
<P>
 As to FCC policy, communications experts say the agency has generally favored 
combinations among companies to foster development of the new technologies. And 
they recalled that Vice President Al Gore, in a major speech at UCLA, had 
encouraged companies to combine in new ways to extend the information highway 
to schools, workplaces and homes.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile the technologies of interactive digital communications, wireless 
telephony and satellites, computerization and signal compression, continue to 
develop. And most analysts saw no great effect on the pace of such developments 
in Malone's scuttling of his deal with Bell Atlantic.

MICROSOFT LOSES PATENT LAWSUIT, MUST PAY RIVAL $120 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles jury Wednesday ordered Microsoft Corp. to pay $120 million for 
infringing a software patent held by Stac Electronics Co., a much smaller 
software firm based in Carlsbad, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict may help nudge the balance of power in the computer software 
industry. This is the first time that Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft, which has 
a reputation as the industry's Goliath, has been found to have infringed a 
patent. 
</P>
<P>
 Software patents remain controversial; critics have contended that the U.S. 
Patent Office does not understand the industry and issues patents that are too 
broad. Patent attorneys said Wednesday's decision will encourage small software 
firms to use patents as leverage against the industry's big players. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have provided a prototype of how small, innovative companies can use 
patent protection to erect a barrier to entry of a strong competitor," said 
Stac Chief Executive Gary Clow. "It wasn't easy, but we showed we can compete 
with Microsoft." 
</P>
<P>
 The jury in U.S. District Court found that the data-compression technology 
contained in Microsoft's MS-DOS 6.0 software infringed a patent held by Stac, 
whose core product is a program known as Stacker, which similarly performs data 
compression. 
</P>
<P>
 The technology at issue in the case allows personal computer users to store 
nearly twice as much data on their hard drives without buying bigger ones, a 
big plus in an era of swollen software and gigantic graphics files. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft had negotiated with Stac for several months in 1992 to license the 
smaller firm's technology, but the companies failed to reach an agreement. DOS, 
one of Microsoft's core products, is the basic operating system used in nearly 
100 million IBM-compatible personal computers around the world. The company has 
shipped about 22 million units of DOS 6.0 and upgrades so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Clow said Stac plans to seek a permanent injunction to prevent Microsoft from 
shipping new copies of MS-DOS with the contested feature. Microsoft said it 
will appeal the decision and "take every step possible to prevent an 
injunction," but will immediately release a version of MS-DOS 6 without data 
compression. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of DOS 6.2 without data compression are likely to improve sales of 
Stacker. That may help put to rest Stac's other legal problem, a shareholder 
class-action suit that accuses the company and its top executives of misleading 
investors in connection with an initial public offering last May. 
</P>
<P>
 Stac went public at $12 a share, then slipped to $3 after Microsoft announced 
it was shipping DOS 6.0 with Doublespace, its data-compression feature. 
</P>
<P>
 Stac shares stopped trading on Nasdaq before the trial's outcome was 
announced. Before the halt, Stac was up 12.5 cents at $4.375. Microsoft closed 
$1.50 higher at $81, also on Nasdaq. Analysts said Microsoft's shares rose on 
separate news about new product releases. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft said that if it has to pay the $120 million, the figure will account 
for a 26-cent-per-share charge against earnings. The award represents about 
three times Stac's 1993 revenue of $37 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft did win one of seven counterclaims. The jury ruled that Stac 
illegally used access to Microsoft trade secrets to make one of its software 
products, Stacker 3.1, compatible with MS-DOS 6.0. Microsoft was awarded about 
$13.6 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, Stac's lawyers showed a videotape of Microsoft Chairman Bill 
Gates -- who testified during the monthlong trial -- at the unveiling of MS-DOS 
6.0 in which he wore a T-shirt saying, "We came, we saw, we doubled," to 
underscore the importance of the compression feature.

DEFINING THE FUTURE OF TV; JAPAN OFFICIAL WITHDRAWS ANNOUNCEMENT ON HDTV; 
TECHNOLOGY: ANALYSTS SAY CONFUSION AT THE TOP REFLECTS WEAKNESS IN HOSOKAWA'S 
NEW COALITION GOVERNMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY and LESLIE HELM, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a display of confusion and cross purposes totally unlike the Japan the 
world once thought it knew. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, a senior official said Japan will cease support of a Japanese 
standard for super-high-quality televisions because the technology does not 
match world trends. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, the official recanted, and the presidents of Japan's top 
electronics firms launched a counterattack to assure consumers that the 
new-generation technology is alive and well. 
</P>
<P>
 The disarray among top policy players reflects weakness and inexperience in 
the new coalition government under Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, analysts 
say, as miscalculations become apparent in a growing range of policy areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The flap over high-definition television also underscores the high risks of 
government targeting industries in which the pace of technological change is 
swift. Although Japanese corporations spent an estimated $3 billion on the 
system called Hi-Vision, most analysts believe the next generation of 
television sets will eventually use a fully digital standard easily compatible 
with computers. Such a standard is now being developed by a "grand alliance" of 
American companies led by Zenith. 
</P>
<P>
 Akimasa Egawa, a top Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications official, 
shocked Japan on Tuesday when he announced at a news conference that Japan 
would abandon the Hi-Vision standard to put the nation in line with the trend 
toward digital television in the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 But Egawa did so without any broad consensus backing him up. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa's government, which took power last year after 38 years of unbroken 
rule by the pro-business Liberal Democratic Party, lacks the skills to resolve 
conflicts among powerful bureaucrats and other interested parties, explained 
Minoru Morita, a prominent political analyst. The result Wednesday was an 
outburst of corporate anger and official backpedaling. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, senior members of the LDP would have mediated among the 
ministry, NHK and the companies," Morita said. "Now this process is happening 
in public. You don't have politicians experienced enough to act as 
coordinators." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Hosokawa has at times proven inept. Just three weeks ago, the prime 
minister announced a major tax reform package, only to be forced the next day 
to withdraw it because he hadn't fully cleared it with his political allies and 
relevant ministries. A heavily revised package was later approved. 
</P>
<P>
 A furious reaction from industry and Japan's powerful semi-governmental 
television station, NHK, forced Egawa to retract his statement. While 
confirming Japan's need to take a more serious look at the trend toward digital 
television, Egawa said at a news conference Wednesday that the Ministry will 
"continue to promote Hi-Vision as we have in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Experimental HDTV broadcasts will be expanded into full-time regular 
broadcasting, as previously planned, once a new satellite begins service in 
1997, Egawa said. 
</P>
<P>
 An hour after Egawa spoke, the presidents of Sony, Matsushita Electric and 
NEC, three of Japan's leading electronics manufacturers, held their own joint 
news conference to assure the public that the Hi-Vision standard will continue 
to expand in use well into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized in a collective effort led by NHK and the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications, Japanese companies invested heavily in HDTV over the past 
20 years in hopes of generating a new consumer boom. Electronics companies face 
sharply declining sales of VCRs and other key products and are desperate to 
find new items to keep their factories humming. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to promote Hi-Vision, Japan's Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry has offered subsidies and tax breaks to 31 regions designated as 
special HDTV areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporations have come up with HDTV-related products. Consumer electronics 
maker JVC sells a VCR for the Hi-Vision standard, while a cosmetics company 
recently developed a line of products that is supposed to hide wrinkles that 
show up more clearly on HDTV. 
</P>
<P>
 But HDTV has been a big disappointment. With sets costing upward of $6,000, 
only 20,000 have been sold. The only HDTV programming available is nine hours a 
day broadcast by NHK that has been widely criticized as boring. 
</P>
<P>
 The uproar over Hi-Vision's future is likely to increase doubts among private 
broadcasters regarding the wisdom of investing huge sums to broadcast HDTV. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan has faced similar troubles with other cutting-edge technologies. While 
superb at manufacturing sophisticated hardware, Japanese firms have a weaker 
record in software fields. As the world moves toward a multimedia age, with a 
premium on creativity and fast action, even huge firms such as Nippon Telegraph 
& Telephone Corp. are seeking links with U.S. firms that might help them keep 
up with the fast pace of change. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese companies insist that in any event, their investments in Hi-Vision 
will not be completely wasted. Because the Japanese standard is a hybrid of the 
old analog and new digital technologies, much that was developed for Hi-Vision 
will be applicable to sets made using the next digital standard. 
</P>
<P>
 They also deny that consumers have wasted money by spending huge sums on 
Hi-Vision television sets. "Whatever comes out in the future, people won't have 
to throw out their receivers," said Norio Ohga, president of Sony.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: DEFINING THE FUTURE OF TV; HOW THE U.S. WON ROUND 
ONE IN THE BATTLE OVER STANDARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE, Michael Schrage is a writer, consultant and research 
associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He writes this column 
independently for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After spending billions trying to bully America into doubling the video 
resolution of its analog television sets, Japan finally conceded that the D in 
HDTV will have to stand for digital . The very next day, the Japanese commenced 
a furious backpedal -- right off a cliff. 
</P>
<P>
 But all this sound and fury signifies nothing. Even Japan Inc. can't impose an 
outdated technology by group incantation. America's model of manipulable 
multimedia will thus succeed Japan's vision of high-definition video. The 
Federal Communications Commission and U.S. companies, not Japan's Ministry of 
Posts and Telecommunications or Sony or Sega, will set the world's technical 
standards for tomorrow's generation of living room media. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, we won!  
</P>
<P>
 At least for the moment. Of course, there's nothing inherent in the new 
FCC-Zenith standard that would deny a Sony, Matsushita or Samsung the 
opportunity to dominate digital TV sets the way they've ruled the manufacture 
of today's televisions. Creating a standard does not guarantee any market 
share; just ask RCA. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet American media companies have become far more sophisticated than their 
global counterparts about the role of standards in defining competitiveness. 
Today, innovative standards -- not merely innovative technologies -- have 
become the true battlefield for global multimedia. A standard has to be more 
than a product, a service or a technical format. It must be a framework for 
innovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Creating new standards is not like developing new products: Your competitive 
edge comes not from what you keep secret and proprietary, but from what you 
make open and accessible. Successful American companies understand this. Most 
Japanese companies still do not. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Sony's Betamax VCR failed not because it was an inferior 
technical offering but because the company managed it as a product rather than 
a platform for design. (JVC and Matsushita managed VHS less as a global 
standard than as a set of technical specifications to gang up on Sony.) 
</P>
<P>
 More than a decade ago, the launch of the audio compact disc standard by Sony 
and Philips was brilliantly managed, but the Dutch electronics giant's recent 
efforts to establish CD-interactive as a multimedia standard have been a 
failure. Similarly, 3DO's new multimedia player -- though technically 
intriguing and sponsored by the likes of Matsushita and AT&T -- has been a 
disappointment, not merely because the software isn't there to support it, but 
because hardware firms insist that the business incentives to make it a 
standard just aren't there. 
</P>
<P>
 The collapse of Japan's HDTV initiative didn't just reflect the technical 
triumph of American digital over Japanese analog. It also reflects a sober 
business assessment that it would be very hard for anyone but the Japanese to 
make real money supporting this standard. As a global business proposition, 
HDTV's standards infrastructure was poorly designed and poorly defined. 
</P>
<P>
 Who understands the business of standards better than anyone? Probably Bill 
Gates and Microsoft. Microsoft really isn't in the software business; it's in 
the standards business. Microsoft succeeds not because it writes the best code 
but because it sets the best standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft Windows -- the personal computer software that made Gates a 
multibillionaire -- was nurtured and developed to be a standard, not just 
another operating system. Prices are kept low, third-party suppliers can easily 
make lots of money and the system is constantly and collaboratively upgraded to 
keep it supple. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft's goal was emphatically not the maximization of revenue or even 
market share; it was creating relationships with customers, software developers 
and microprocessor firms such as Intel to give as many good reasons as possible 
to support -- strategically, financially and technically -- Microsoft's 
operating systems. 
</P>
<P>
 These networks of relationships -- not superior technology or marketing savvy 
-- are what make a standard something more than a product. The standard is not 
the product of a company, it's the byproduct of these networks. Managing the 
standard means managing these networks. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM understood this too late. Apple understood but failed to act. Nintendo 
understood but didn't care. The FCC understood, and that's why its digital HDTV 
standard has just conquered Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Microsoft is chatting with John Malone's TCI and the cable TV 
industry about how to bring Windows to the set-top box, and the company 
recently announced it would collaborate with Sega to create a new standard for 
video game technology. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Nintendo, which parlayed a proprietary standard to riches but is now 
suffering as a result, Microsoft seems likely to bring its brand of standards 
to home entertainment. It will be interesting to watch how standards intersect 
when Windows comes to digital TV. Don't touch that mouse! Or remote control . . 
. or joystick . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Paradoxically, standards have become so important in media technology that 
there is now a strong market incentive to make them unimportant. Why not design 
a new generation of technologies that, rather than rendering existing standards 
obsolete, merely makes them irrelevant? 
</P>
<P>
 How do you do that? Microprocessors and memories are getting ever faster, ever 
cheaper. Use the technology to supersede the standards. Why not a television 
set or a cable box or a "media converter" that's smart enough to play whatever 
media standard is plugged in? Load the operating system right along with the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, your CD-ROM can be in Windows or Macintosh or Unix or HDTV -- it 
doesn't matter. Your player would simply load up the appropriate standard on 
its chips and the program you wanted to play -- then off you go. Or your 
set-top box could configure your digital TV to play NTSC, PAL, SECAM, Nintendo, 
Windows or whatever format your fiber-optic line piped down into your cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, tomorrow's technologies could make all the effort being 
invested in today's media standards irrelevant. Are the Japanese working on 
this new generation of silicon? What do you think?

 Chrysler Executives Win Huge Bonuses: Top executives at Chrysler Corp. got 
bonuses doubling their salaries as rewards for a year that generated $3.8 
billion in profits, according to a published report.The hefty bonuses for 1993 
performance were doled out to 200 directors, department managers, vice 
presidents and above, the Detroit News reported, citing unnamed Chrysler 
executives. Word of the bonuses comes after Chrysler's 65,000 union workers 
received record profit-sharing checks averaging $4,300. Another hundred 
executives just below the top level received bonuses of 75% to 85% of their 
annual pay, the report said.

 Movie's NC-17 Rating Upheld: The Rating Appeals Board run by the Motion 
Picture Assn. of America and the National Assn. of Theater Owners has upheld 
the rating for Martin Lawrence's upcoming comedy concert film, "You So 
Crazy."Lawrence appealed the rating board's original decision last week, citing 
a responsibility to uphold the concept of free speech. Lawrence and Miramax 
Films were hoping for an R rating, which would allow children under 17 to see 
the film if accompanied by their parents. The chairman of the Classification 
and Rating Administration said the rating was upheld solely because of the 
film's language. The film is scheduled to be released March 4.

 Stringer Trips at Olympics: CBS Broadcast Group President Howard Stringer fell 
and broke his leg on the way to see the Nancy Kerrigan/Tonya Harding skate-off 
in Norway.Stringer, who was treated at a hospital, missed the event that is 
helping CBS achieve record ratings in the Olympics. Jokes soon began 
circulating at CBS in New York about which executives from rival TV networks 
had been seen with a pipe -- or driving a getaway car from the scene. 
Stringer's accident was said to be one of several incidents of broken bones on 
the ice at Lillehammer.

 Reich Defends Retraining Program: Labor Secretary Robert Reich, addressing the 
skepticism of several union leaders, said the economy is producing a high 
number of skilled jobs that demand new training programs. "Retraining for 
what?" has been the refrain of many labor leaders over the past year as the 
Clinton Administration highlighted its goal of retraining workers displaced by 
job cuts, technological advances and new trade policies. Although Reich said 
the question did not come up during his hourlong meeting with the 35-member 
AFL-CIO Executive Council in Bal Harbour, Fla., he said 60% of the 1.6 million 
private-sector jobs created last year were technical, managerial or 
professional and that many more are coming.

STATE REAPS 38% OF LATEST FUNDS FOR DEFENSE CONVERSIONS; TECHNOLOGY: PENTAGON 
AWARDS $190 MILLION TO 50 PROJECTS NATIONWIDE. PROGRAM HOLDS A MAJOR POLITICAL 
STAKE FOR CLINTON. 
</P>

 High-technology projects led by California companies and public organizations 
won 38% of the funding announced by the Pentagon on Wednesday under its 
Technology Reinvestment Program, the cornerstone of the Clinton 
Administration's defense conversion effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon awarded 50 projects nationwide a total of $190 million in federal 
funds, which must also be matched by private funding. The California share of 
the awards amounts to about $72 million for 14 projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is still too early to assess whether the technology programs will 
succeed, President Clinton has a major political stake in the effort's 
prospects to bolster the national economy as well as his standing in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a cornerstone of our reinvestment and conversion initiative, recognizing 
that those who worked so hard to win the Cold War should not be unduly burdened 
by cutbacks in military expenditures," Clinton told California officials 
Wednesday at a White House ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 But the President's conversion program has been criticized by many experts as 
being too small and poorly organized to make any significant dent in the 
regional economic damage brought by the end of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 After four rounds of awards, California organizations have taken about 28% of 
the $605 million in total funding, or about $170 million in direct federal 
grants, according to White House officials. 
</P>
<P>
 California's large share of the awards have prompted complaints from Congress, 
though White House and Pentagon officials insist that the awards are based on 
merit alone and that California's large share reflects its large defense 
technology base. 
</P>
<P>
 The California projects include 10 programs to develop new technology for 
commercial markets, two programs to set up alliances that can deploy existing 
defense manufacturing technology and two training and education programs. The 
California winners include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Lear Astronics Corp., a Santa Monica-based defense firm. It plans to spend 
$42 million to develop an automated aircraft landing system using radar and 
infrared sensors that give pilots an image of a runway in dense fog and snow. 
It would allow commercial aircraft to land at 1,276 U.S. airports that do not 
have sophisticated instrument landing systems. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bay Area Regional Transit and Hughes Aircraft. They plan to spend $39 
million to develop a system using the Pentagon's global positioning system to 
help reduce the separation between trains, effectively doubling the passenger 
capacity of the commuter system. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hughes Aircraft and other General Motors subsidiaries. They plan to spend 
$12.2 million to develop an automobile collision-avoidance system to alert a 
driver to hazards by sensing vehicle separation and loss of control.  
</P>
<P>
 * The Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp. and the Los Angeles 
Unified School District. They won funding for a $2-million advanced-technology 
training center aimed at helping disadvantaged youths.  
</P>
<P>
 * A consortium of two dozen California organizations, led by the Great Lakes 
Composites Consortium. It won a grant to organize a $1.4-million composites 
technology center at Cerritos College.

 Treasury Note Yields Rise in Auction: Amid fears of further Federal Reserve 
Board interest rate increases, investors shunned the government's auction of 
new two-year notes Wednesday and, in response, traders sent yields of Treasury 
securities sharply higher.Yields on the two-year notes rose to the highest 
level in 14 months. The high yield was 4.66%, up from 4.11% at the last auction 
Jan. 25. It was the highest rate since two-year notes sold for 4.71% on Dec. 
22, 1992. The notes will carry a coupon interest rate of 4.625%, with each 
$10,000 in face value selling for $9,993.40. A total of $17 billion in notes 
were sold.

STATE ENDS SUPPLEMENTAL JOBLESS AID; LABOR: CALIFORNIA COULD SHARE COST OF 
KEEPING PROGRAM, BUT GOV. WILSON HAS VETOED SUCH ATTEMPTS, CITING THE TAX 
BURDEN.

 Thousands of out-of-work Californians are getting more bad news: The state has 
quietly stopped granting supplemental jobless benefits, a move that advocates 
for the poor say will push more people onto the welfare rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobless workers in the recession-battered state are still eligible for 26 
weeks of regular unemployment insurance, but they can no longer collect 
unemployment benefits beyond that period. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, under a federal-state program that expired this month, some 
long-term unemployed workers in California received up to 33 weeks of 
supplemental assistance after exhausting their regular benefits. It provided up 
to $230 a week in benefits, the same maximum as under regular unemployment 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next month, 45,000 to 50,000 Californians are expected to exhaust 
their supplemental benefits, and another 30,000 to 36,000 are expected to use 
up their regular unemployment assistance.  
</P>
<P>
 Congress approved the so-called emergency unemployment compensation program in 
November, 1991, and renewed it several times while the U.S. economy was 
struggling. But after the nation's business recovery gained steam in recent 
months -- and with declining numbers of workers qualifying for regular and 
supplemental unemployment insurance -- lawmakers decided to let the program 
die. 
</P>
<P>
 Some advocates for the poor say that many of the jobless in California -- 
which has the second-highest unemployment rate in the nation and continues to 
struggle despite the national upturn -- could be hit hard by the program's 
demise. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality is that people are looking for work and they're not finding 
anything," said Laura Fry, an employment lawyer with the Legal Aid Foundation 
of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In big counties across the state, social services officials said they so far 
have noticed no substantial increase in long-term unemployed workers applying 
for welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does seem like we're seeing something, but it's hard to tell" until more 
figures are in, said Angelo Doti, director of financial assistance for the 
Orange County Social Services Agency.  
</P>
<P>
 He added that the numbers are likely to increase as the jobless workers' 
savings run out. "Most people don't apply for social assistance unless they're 
really desperate," Doti said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shannon Bowman, a spokeswoman for the California Health and Welfare 
Agency, said officials in Gov. Pete Wilson's administration doubt that the 
benefits cutoff will put significantly more people into the welfare system. She 
said state officials in the past have never noticed a direct link between 
unemployment insurance cutoffs and a rising demand for welfare, and they do not 
expect it this time.

 A handful of states with high unemployment, including California, could still 
participate in a backup extended-benefits program, provided they split the cost 
with the federal government. However, Wilson has twice vetoed attempts to bring 
the state into the backup program, citing the extra tax burden it would place 
on employers.

 "With the fragile business climate, the governor is trying to do everything he 
can to keep business in California," Bowman said, adding that the state 
government believes that emergency unemployment insurance should be a federal 
responsibility, especially because federal cutbacks have contributed so greatly 
to the state's current high unemployment.

 Under the emergency jobless benefits program, no new applications are being 
accepted from people who have exhausted their regular 26 weeks of unemployment 
insurance. However, emergency benefits that were approved before Feb. 5 can 
continue up to April 30.

<P>
 The expiration of the emergency benefits program comes amid efforts by the 
Clinton Administration to overhaul the entire unemployment insurance system. 
U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich said in a recent interview that the 
Administration will send Congress a proposal within a month that would provide 
incentives for people on unemployment insurance to seek job training.

insurance for up to 18 months provided they were in approved job training

 Market Overview 
</P>
<P>
 * Stock prices fell Wednesday, giving back most of Tuesday's gains, after 
investors decided that they were concerned about inflation and interest rates 
after all. 
</P>
<P>
 * Investors afraid that another interest rate hike is imminent avoided the 
Treasury's auction of new two-year notes, sending long-term bond yields 
soaring. Stocks 
</P>
<P>
 The market was also pushed lower by the rise in bond yields. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 19.98 at 3,891.68, losing most of 
Tuesday's 24-point gain, while in the broader market, declining issues narrowly 
outnumbered advancing ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad-market indexes were also lower. The Nasdaq composite index of mostly 
smaller stocks fell a modest 2.04 to 789.11. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Board volume was a robust 309.91 million shares, compared to 270.90 on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the blue-chip average surged after congressional testimony by 
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan allayed investors' fears that 
inflation would prompt the Fed to raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan said that while the Fed is likely to tighten credit, the timing of 
rate increases was not certain and "overall price pressures appear to remain 
damped." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, however, traders took the view that inflation is at the door and 
that it is likely to cause long-term problems for stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is still the lingering fear that inflation is a bigger problem than 
Greenspan says it is," said John H. Shaughnessy, research director at Advest 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * There were some big losers among economically sensitive stocks in the Dow 
30, including Alcoa, which fell 1 to 76; Goodyear, down 1 1/4 to 45; Minnesota 
Mining & Manufacturing, down 7/8 to 106 7/8, and United Technologies, off 1 1/4 
at 67 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hewlett-Packard gained 1 5/8 to 91 3/4 after the firm's 15% investment in 
Taligent received final regulatory approval. 
</P>
<P>
 * First Interstate Bancorp soared 2 7/8 to 69 3/4 after pulling out of a 
Montgomery Securities conference, sparking speculation that it is holding 
merger or acquisition talks with another company. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks turned mixed in the afternoon. Tele-Communications Class A 
stock fell 5/8 to 24 1/4. But Dell Computer was up 1 3/8 at 24 1/8, and Lotus 
Development was up 1 3/4 at 70 after saying it expects to add about 600,000 new 
Lotus Notes users this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas markets were mixed. Tokyo's key Nikkei average ended at 19,341.83, 
off a mere 0.80 point. In Frankfurt, the 30-share DAX average was up 20.05 
points at 2,127.67, and London's Financial Times 100-share average closed 8.2 
points higher at 3,341.9. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index dropped 62.70 points to 2,572.35 on heavy selling by 
foreign investors. Credit 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's main 30-year bond yield jumped to 6.65% from 6.60% the day 
before, pushing prices down 5/8 point, or $6.25 per $1,000 in face value. 
Yields and prices move in opposite directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Shorter-term maturities fell even more sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the government's first sale of fresh two-year notes since the Fed 
pushed up short-term interest rates for the first time in five years on Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 As such, it was closely watched by market participants for further evidence of 
the bearishness that followed the Fed's action. They were not disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury sold $17 billion of new two-year Treasury notes at a high yield 
of 4.66%, up from 4.11% at the last auction Jan. 25 and the highest level in 14 
months. Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 The dollar finished higher against most foreign currencies after spending most 
of the day trading in a narrow range influenced mainly by technical factors. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar ended at 105.55 Japanese yen, down from 105.60 on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Platinum futures prices steepened their slide from a six-month high as traders 
turned to prospects for Russian sales of the metal. 
</P>
<P>
 Platinum for April delivery fell $5.90 on the New York Merc to $391.20 an 
ounce.  
</P>

 On the New York Comex, gold closed at $377.70 an ounce, off 30 cents, while 
silver closed at $5.229 an ounce, up 1.6 cents.

SUPREME COURT BACKS FDIC IN S&L FIRINGS; WORKPLACE: THE AGENCY ROUTINELY 
DISMISSES THE OFFICERS OF FAILED THRIFTS. AN OAKLAND EXECUTIVE SUED FOR LACK OF 
DUE PROCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Reversing a verdict in a California case, the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday 
shielded federal agencies such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. from 
having to pay monetary damages for firing employees in violation of their 
constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The 9-0 ruling in favor of the FDIC protects the agency from potentially huge 
payments to officers of more than 1,750 savings and loans taken over by federal 
regulators since 1986. The FDIC routinely dismisses the senior officers of 
troubled thrifts, even if they did not engage in any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision throws out a $130,000 verdict won by an executive who contended 
that he was fired without due process when federal regulators took control of 
the Oakland-based thrift for which he worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the doctrine of sovereign immunity, the government generally cannot be 
sued for damages. There are exceptions, however. Congress can authorize suits 
against a government agency. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said 
Congress did just that when it created the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance 
Corp. and its successor, the FDIC. 
</P>
<P>
 By law, these agencies can "sue and be sued" under certain circumstances, and 
the appeals court relied on this provision to uphold the fired executive's 
damage claim against the FDIC. 
</P>
<P>
 That conclusion set off alarms in the Justice Department, which told the high 
court that the decision "threatens dramatic interference with this nation's 
efforts to deal with failed financial institutions." 
</P>
<P>
 The court concurred, in an opinion written by Justice Clarence Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, Oakland-based Fidelity Savings and Loan was losing an average of $5 
million a month when federal regulators intervened. John H. Meyer, an executive 
vice president, was fired by FDIC officials without a hearing to contest the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer contended that the FDIC had taken away his job "without due process of 
law," and a jury awarded him $130,000. The 9th Circuit Court upheld the 
judgment on the grounds that the FDIC is open to such lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 But in his opinion, Thomas said, "If we were to recognize a direct action for 
damages against federal agencies, we would be creating a potentially enormous 
financial burden for the federal government."

SENATE PANEL VOTES TO ALLOW BANKS TO MERGE SUBSIDIARIES INTO COAST-TO-COAST 
NETWORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate Banking Committee voted unanimously Wednesday to let banks operate 
as one seamless network from coast to coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, which requires full Senate approval and House action, would revise 
banking regulations in effect since 1927 and update the system for the modern 
era. 
</P>
<P>
 It would allow bank holding companies, which are growing rapidly in size as 
they buy up regional banks, to merge their subsidiaries into one main bank that 
could operate branches in any state. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers could then cash checks, deposit money or get loans almost anywhere 
in the United States where their hometown bank had branches. The revision would 
simplify banking for the customer and lower costs for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank companies currently must have separate corporate structures for each 
state in which they operate. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a major step toward modernizing our banking system and increasing its 
efficiency," Senate Banking Chairman Donald Riegle (D-Mich.) said after the 
19-0 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something we should have done 20 years ago," Texas Republican Phil 
Gramm said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very optimistic," said Edward Yingling, chief lobbyist for the 
American Bankers Assn. "A large number of lawmakers want to get this bill done 
without extraneous material to confuse it and blow it up." 
</P>
<P>
 The measure has unusual momentum after passing the Senate Banking 
subcommittee; a similar bill zipped through a House Banking subcommittee 
earlier this month on a 25-0 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Decades of wrangling among insurance agents, small banks and consumer 
activists over limiting bank powers had torpedoed a similar bill only two years 
ago. But lawmakers began to see nationwide banking as inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Many states have already banded together in regional pacts that allow banks to 
cross state lines. Automated teller machines, the ease of computer processing 
and competition from nationwide brokerage houses offering bank-style money 
accounts wore away resistance to the idea of mega-banks. 
</P>
<P>
 The final stumbling block was swept aside when Sen. Christopher J. Dodd 
(D-Conn.) said he would not insist on an amendment curbing banks' ability to 
sell insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate panel's bill would allow bank acquisitions across state lines one 
year after enactment. Subsidiary banks could be combined into one bank with 
interstate branches after two years. But individual states could choose to 
block out-of-state banks from operating branches if they wished. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank holding companies would not be allowed to control more than 25% of a 
state's deposits without a waiver from that state or 10% of deposits 
nationwide.

TASK FORCE DISPUTES DIESEL COMPLAINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A task force looking into truckers' complaints about the state's new 
low-pollution diesel fuel has found that relatively few engine problems have 
resulted from the product -- and that those that have are probably linked to 
refining methods, not the fuel standards themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The trucking organization that helped persuade Gov. Pete Wilson to form the 
task force angrily condemned the findings released Wednesday. State regulators, 
who had been widely criticized after the diesel was introduced Oct. 1, claimed 
vindication. 
</P>
<P>
 "It underscores what we've been saying all along," said Bill Sessa, a 
spokesman for the California Air Resources Board. The agency had mandated lower 
content of a diesel component called aromatics -- a change that some truckers 
said caused widespread failure of their engines. 
</P>
<P>
 "The leaking O-rings" -- devices used in various parts of diesel engines to 
prevent fuel leaks -- "weren't supposed to happen at all," Sessa said. "But it 
happened to a small percentage of vehicles on the road, almost all of them 
high-mileage." 
</P>
<P>
 The task force, he noted, accepted an ARB study of 7,000 heavy diesel trucks 
that found leaks from any source in engine O-rings in only 2.7% of the trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, that is pretty negligible," said James J. Lee, spokesman for the 
California Environmental Protection Agency -- particularly, he said, since most 
of the problems occurred with older O-rings likely to be replaced soon anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the report acknowledged that for the "relatively small percentage" of 
truckers affected, the problems were serious. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Titus, spokesman for the California Trucking Assn., complained that the 
task force did not accept thousands of reports of engine failure that his 
organization presented. "We think this is an absolute government cover-up of a 
major screw-up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's report found that the Oct. 1 changes in diesel fuel -- which also 
included a federally mandated switch to lower sulfur content -- may not be 
directly causing the few mechanical problems reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The culprit, the task force found, is more likely the process -- called 
hydrotreating -- that refiners use to lower diesel's sulfur content. 
Hydrotreating, it said, could affect the lubricity of diesel and the ability of 
O-rings to swell and shrink. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Chevron Corp., the largest diesel refiner in the state, said 
the company already mixes in additives to restore lubricity.

NYSE FINES SMITH BARNEY SHEARSON; WALL STREET: EXCHANGE SAYS IT REPEATEDLY 
FAILED TO REPORT COMPLAINTS AGAINST ITS BROKERS. THE FIRM ADMITS NO GUILT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The New York Stock Exchange disclosed Wednesday that it has charged Smith 
Barney Shearson, the nation's second-largest brokerage, with repeatedly failing 
to notify regulators of customer complaints and disciplinary proceedings 
against its brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 In at least one instance, such a lapse prevented the NYSE from launching its 
own investigation of a broker, the exchange alleged. The lack of timely 
reporting meant that customers would not have been able to get accurate 
information about the disciplinary records of the 44 brokers involved, it said. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges and a settlement with Smith Barney were signed Jan. 18 but were 
not made public until Wednesday. Smith Barney neither admitted nor denied the 
allegations but agreed to a $50,000 fine and a censure. It also agreed to 
overhaul its procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 In 61 instances in 1992 and 1993, the exchange said, Smith Barney violated 
rules requiring it to promptly report customer complaints, arbitration cases, 
disciplinary proceedings, judgments and settlements involving its brokers to 
the NYSE and the National Assn. of Securities Dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after receiving a warning letter from the Big Board in September, 1992, 
Smith Barney continued to be months late in making the required filings, the 
exchange charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith Barney spokesman Robert Connor said the firm's reporting to the NYSE 
"apparently was a little scattered in how it was handled." But, he added, 
"today we're operating in accordance with the procedures that are required for 
accurate reporting of this information." The firm is a subsidiary of Travelers 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the reporting requirements is to alert the stock exchanges to 
possible serious wrongdoing so they can launch investigations. Information on 
complaints and actions against brokers must also be listed on a termination 
form whenever a broker is fired or resigns. 
</P>
<P>
 The forms allow prospective employers to evaluate brokers' disciplinary 
records. The information also goes into a central computer system operated by 
the National Assn. of Securities Dealers through which investors can check the 
records of their brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 The NYSE charges did not disclose the names of brokers and gave no details of 
the matters that Smith Barney allegedly failed to report. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Securities and Exchange Commission officials have said they are 
likely to release within a month the results of an investigation into major 
Wall Street firms that hire and retain brokers with long records of complaints 
and judgments against them. The investigation, known as the Large Firm Project, 
has been under way for well over a year.

COVER STORY; FEARING THE WORST; RECENT HIGH-PROFILE CASES BRING VIOLENCE CLOSE 
TO HOME, BUT DESPITE PERCEPTIONS, THE CRIME RATE MAY ACTUALLY BE DECLINING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A masked gunman bursts into a meeting of police officers in Torrance and kills 
two of them before he is killed. The daughter of an El Segundo City Council 
member is murdered in her home and her young daughter's throat slashed. A 
police officer in Manhattan Beach is shot dead while his young nephew looks on. 
Eleven people are gunned down in Inglewood in just two days, the worst outburst 
of violence in that city's history. At an upscale mall restaurant in Redondo 
Beach, gunfire erupts during an argument among three men, two of them wearing 
bulletproof vests; one man is shot seven times and dies on the restaurant 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a bloody few months in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time not so long ago, many residents say, when the South Bay 
seemed almost immune to the violence that besets other parts of Los Angeles. 
Particularly in the upscale beach communities and the even more upscale "bridle 
path" towns of the Palos Verdes Peninsula, urban violence was something people 
watched on TV or read about in the newspapers. It seldom if ever hit close to 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Not anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past two months, two small-town police departments that had never 
lost an officer in the line of duty learned what it was like to bury three of 
their own. Small-town residents have seen stories of crime in their cities 
splashed across the front pages. "Wanted posters" showing a police sketch of a 
suspected cop killer -- the gunman who killed Manhattan Beach Police Officer 
Martin Ganz -- are now a fixture in countless South Bay stores, offices and 
public buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews with South Bay residents from El Segundo to the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula, people say they feel they're facing a crime onslaught, with their 
backs against the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 It has affected them in myriad ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Faye Flatland, 60, who with her husband runs a Hawthorne bookkeeping business, 
often removes her diamond wedding band or turns the stone inside her finger 
when she goes out. "I never used to do that," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 For Theresa Sanchez, 32, of Hermosa Beach, crime has prompted a career change 
and probably a change of address. She had wanted to be a cop, and was scheduled 
to take the Los Angeles Police Department qualification test last month. But 
after the Ganz killing in December, Sanchez decided to become a nurse instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the idea of leaving the state," Sanchez says. "I have a feeling it's 
only going to get worse around here." 
</P>
<P>
 Crime forced Virginia Benedict, 75, of Gardena to chain down the hood on her 
1971 Chevy Nova to protect her car battery -- and even that wasn't protection 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four times they stole the battery," she says. "I had a chain lock on it and 
they pulled that right off. . . . I've lived in Los Angeles all my life. We 
never even used to lock our doors. It's really worse now than it has ever been. 
People just don't seem to care." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Deurloo, 48, a retired firefighter in Torrance, always calls ahead to 
friends and gives them a "flight plan" describing the route he will take to 
meet them. "That way," he says, "if I don't show up, they'll know something's 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 For Don Schima, 28, of Redondo Beach, crime has changed the nature of birthday 
and Christmas presents. Because his 1984 Toyota pickup has been broken into 
three times in the past few years, he gets auto anti-theft devices. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I grew up here, it was great area," says Schima. "Crime wasn't a 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Like almost everybody else in the South Bay, Schima longs for "the good old 
days" -- the good old low-crime days. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony is that, in terms of crime, the "good old days" weren't always that 
good.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Consider, for example, Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 According to FBI statistics, compared to the good old days, murder last year 
was up only slightly (three cases in 1980 and four in 1993), reported rapes are 
down by more than half (46 to 18), robberies are more or less level (151 to 
145), aggravated assault is up (177 to 222) and burglaries are way down (1,137 
to 848). 
</P>
<P>
 Or how about El Segundo, where residents are understandably worried about 
crime after the murder of a city councilman's daughter and the slashing of her 
child? Again, it's a mixed bag: fewer murders in 1992 (the last year for which 
statistics were available) than in 1980, fewer reported rapes, more robberies, 
only half as many aggravated assaults, far fewer burglaries (see chart, Page 
12). 
</P>
<P>
 Even Inglewood, the "All American City" that recently made headlines when 11 
people were shot in two nights of gang carnage, actually has seen crime go down 
in most categories in the past dozen years. In 1980 there were 54 murders in 
Inglewood, compared to 44 in 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 Some other South Bay cities also have experienced declines in the crime rate 
over the past 13 years, while others have seen the crime rate remain more or 
less flat in most categories. Still others have seen increases, usually 
relatively slight, in many or most crime categories. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the numbers vary, the overall picture is clear: Bad as it is, crime 
in the South Bay has not increased by astonishing percentages, but fear and 
concern about crime has. 
</P>
<P>
 To police officers, for whom crime statistics are like job performance 
evaluations, the widespread perception that crime is worse is a little 
baffling. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I look at the statistics, it seems like (the crime rate) is pretty 
flat," says El Segundo Police Sgt. Bill Fleming. "Some of the crime is just 
more dramatic, more sensational." 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see a string of high-profile crimes like we've had recently, it hits 
home," says Lt. Jim Oneal of the Lomita sheriff's station, which provides 
police protection to Lomita and three Palos Verdes Peninsula cities. "But over 
the past five years we've actually maintained a very low level of crime. We get 
occasional little spikes, but overall, the trend is steady." 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians, who also keep a close eye on crime statistics, note that crime 
perceptions do not necessarily reflect crime reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Factually, crime has at worst stayed even, and at best has gone down," says 
Rancho Palos Verdes Mayor Steve Kuykendall, a member of several law enforcement 
and public safety boards and commissions. "But the perception is that crime is 
increasing." 
</P>
<P>
 Harbor area Councilman Rudy Svorinich, whose district stretches from San Pedro 
to Watts, is confident that soon the truth -- crime in the harbor area is 
falling -- will win out over the misconception that crime is on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the responsibility of those of us in elected office -- commanders in 
the field, officers in the field, community leaders, neighborhood watch groups 
-- to inform the residents of our particular areas how crime is being 
successfully abated. . . . But I think perceptions die hard. That's the 
problem."  
</P>
<P>
 But at times, even Svorinich must remind himself that crime in his district is 
dropping rather than rising. Svorinich's San Pedro City Hall office was 
burglarized twice in the past two weeks. Thieves stole two VCRs, a computer 
keyboard, a typewriter and Svorinich's mail. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had to really beef up our security," he says with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All this doesn't mean that South Bay residents are paranoid about crime. In 
fact, South Bay residents are simply mirroring a national trend. A recent Los 
Angeles Times poll showed that the number of Americans who rate crime as the 
No. 1 problem in the nation more than doubled in the past six months -- from 
21% to 43%. This comes despite the fact that violent crime in the United States 
actually has been decreasing in the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
 And in human terms, perception may be more important than statistics. When 
your car is broken into, or the woman down the street is raped, or the cop who 
came over when you thought you heard a burglar is suddenly shot dead in the 
street during a routine traffic stop, statistics become meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
 If crime is the problem people believe it is, what can be done about it? 
</P>
<P>
 For most police officers in the South Bay, one answer to the crime problem is 
more cops. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we saw after the earthquake, visible policing in the streets is an 
absolute deterrent to crime," says Hawthorne Police Chief Stephen Port. "The 
problem with it is that it's very expensive. . . . More police is probably the 
prayer and wish of any police chief you talk to." 
</P>
<P>
 But even some police agree that cops alone cannot stop all crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Naturally, everyone looks to increased levels of police in the streets," says 
Lt. Charles Schultz, Lawndale liaison at the Lennox sheriff's station. "In the 
long run, we've been doing that and we've found out that you can never have 
enough. I think it's important we start identifying the social causes of crime 
as a way to solve it. . . . One of the single biggest (factors) is the 
deterioration of the family unit." 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with national trends, South Bay politicians tend to favor harsher 
penalties for criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three-strikes-and-you're-out is not enough," says Lawndale Mayor Harold E. 
Hofmann, referring to legislation that would put repeat felons behind bars for 
life. "And we're going to have to start treating 14-, 15- and 16-year-olds like 
adults. We're going to have to start saying, 'This is wrong and you're going to 
have to pay for it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have a court system that doesn't do its job, that counteracts what 
the police do," says Hawthorne Mayor Larry Guidi. 
</P>
<P>
 Other elected officials believe that citizens can stop crime by reporting 
criminals to the police. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things will get better if people themselves participate in the process," says 
Mayor Edward Vincent of Inglewood, where officials recently instituted a curfew 
for teen-agers in an effort to combat crime. "People know everything. They know 
who's stealing, who's dealing dope, who's committing crimes -- people know it. 
We have to work collectively to solve these problems and it will be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Still other elected officials opt for the "root cause" approach to crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a difficult task, but we have to involve the young people, the gang 
members, and try to get them to have some sense of pride in the community," 
says Carson Councilwoman Sylvia L. Muise-Perez. "The important thing is getting 
to the young people before they go in a wrong direction. . . . I think we're 
doing a little of that. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinary South Bay residents have their own ideas about stemming crime -- 
ranging from the violent to the merely strict to the compassionate. 
</P>
<P>
 "People should carry guns in their homes," says John Keenan, 63, of Redondo 
Beach. "Citizens should be blowing a few (criminals') heads off. That would 
help." 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I feel, our judicial system is not punishing the criminals. This is 
problem No. 1," says Art Cramer, 49, who is part owner of a liquor store in 
Torrance -- a store that has been robbed twice. "We don't want crime, but we 
don't want to punish the criminals. People should be locked up for 20 years if 
they do a robbery . . . not five years." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they need more police," says Guyla DeVilbiss, 37, a Lawndale 
preschool teacher. "In the schools, I think they need to have more after-school 
programs to keep latchkey kids out of trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to get more jobs for people and more education from the parents on 
down," says Jin Wong, 58, also of Lawndale. "We can get along. We don't have to 
fight and kill each other. We're all human beings." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe all of those proposed solutions would work; maybe none would, at least 
not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 But if statistics are any help, South Bay residents may take heart from the 
knowledge that crime, while admittedly terrible, may not be quite as rampant as 
it seems. 
</P>
<P>
 They may also take heart from the brave words of an El Segundo police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always have to have an optimistic view," says Sgt. Bill Fleming. "If you 
become worried that the world is going to hell, you've already got one foot in 
the losers' bracket." South Bay Crime 06,31,10,06,09,12,10 AGGRAVATED CITY

GRAF TURNS TABLES ON AUSTIN; WOMEN'S TENNIS: THE WORLD'S TOP PLAYER ROLLS TO 
6-0, 6-0 VICTORY IN 43 MINUTES IN EVERT CUP, RECALLS LOSS ALMOST 11 1/2 YEARS 
AGO. 
</P>

<P>
 Steffi Graf spent another 43 minutes on the stadium court in the Evert Cup at 
Hyatt Grand Champions Wednesday, long enough to overpower Tracy Austin, 6-0, 
6-0, and avenge her earliest professional defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf, 24, was barely a teen-ager when she lost to Austin at Filderstadt, 
Germany, in her pro debut almost 11 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I played Steffi the first time, she was a little kid -- 13, just 
starting out -- and I was at the top," said Austin, comparing the only two 
matches between the current and former champions. "Now, I'm an old lady at the 
end of my career and she's at the top." 
</P>
<P>
 Austin, 31, is 12 months into her comeback, but is not ready to challenge the 
top-ranked player on the WTA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "It must be an awful feeling to be on the other side and to realize that 
nothing is really working for you," said Graf, asked to put herself in Austin's 
shoes. "It's not a nice spot to be in." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that she would know. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf has dominated women's tennis in the absence of Monica Seles, who has not 
played since last April 30 when she was stabbed by a spectator at a tournament 
in Hamburg, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf has won 62 of her last 64 matches and four consecutive Grand Slam 
tournaments. She is 14-0 this year and has yet to lose a set. 
</P>
<P>
 And it probably didn't help Austin that Graf was stung by a comment allegedly 
made by Austin after their long-ago meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Austin, Graf said Tuesday, had told reporters that "there were hundreds of 
players like me in America." 
</P>
<P>
 Graf, though, said she found no inspiration in the perceived slight -- "There 
was really nothing behind it," she said of her performance -- and that she 
regretted bringing it up before the second-round match. 
</P>
<P>
 "The minute I said it, I said, 'Why did I say it?' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joked Austin, who said Graf had taken her comments out of context: "Maybe I 
should get some of the credit (for her rise to No. 1). Maybe I made her mad and 
motivated. Maybe she could share her trophies with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Austin, who won only 21 points Wednesday, said she felt no embarrassment in 
absorbing only the second shutout loss of her pro career. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's one of the greatest tennis players of all time, and I did the best that 
I could," Austin said. "I have my head up high. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, Aranxta (Sanchez Vicario) lost (to Graf), 0 and 2, at the 
Australian Open, and she's the second-best player in the world. Steffi is . . . 
I just can't describe how good she is right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Second-seeded Mary Joe Fernandez defeated Angelica Gavaldon, 6-3, 6-3, and 
third-seeded Lindsay Davenport, a 17-year-old senior at Murrieta Valley High, 
defeated Natalia Medvedeva, 6-4, 6-1, in first-round matches. . . . 
Fourth-seeded Natalia Zvereva eliminated Linda Harvey-Wild, 6-3, 6-3, in a 
second-round match. . . . Among the no-shows this week is the woman for whom 
the tournament is named, Chris Evert, who bowed out after doctors recommended 
that she not fly here from her home in Boca Raton, Fla., because of minor 
complications with her pregnancy. . . . Boris Becker has declined an invitation 
to accept a wild-card entry into the Newsweek Champions Cup, which starts 
Monday and runs through March 6 at Grand Champions.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oscar De La Hoya is lean and mean. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Take the kid out of the city, send him to the snow-packed mountains for seven 
weeks, have him run several miles every morning at 7,000 feet, raise the heat 
to 90 degrees during his gym sessions and this is what you get. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Training is the hardest part," De La Hoya said at Big Bear, where he is 
preparing to challenge Jimmi Bredahl for the World Boxing Organization junior 
lightweight title March 5 at the Grand Olympic Auditorium. "Fighting is the 
easiest. I wish the fight was tonight." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya weighs 131, only one pound above the division limit. A rangy 5 feet 
10, he has never fought as light as 130 as a professional. When he came to 
camp, he was 138. After his first week of training, he was down to 133. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I can't remember watching a longer or more vigorous boxing workout than the 
one Tuesday at the Larry Goossen Gym. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It was go-go-go for 90 minutes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya shadowboxed five rounds, sparred seven with two left-handers who 
emulated Bredahl, skipped rope, did jumping jacks, tattooed the light bag and 
attacked oversized hand pads held by trainer Robert Alcazar. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Everything was done to the beat of recorded Latin music, and Alcazar often 
clapped his hands as though to urge his fighter to work at an even quicker 
pace. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The United States' only gold-medal boxer at Barcelona in 1992 is 11-0 with 10 
knockouts, but has fought less than three minutes since last August because of 
a dispute that ended when he bought out then-managers Steve Nelson and Robert 
Mittleman. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I've missed the excitement of being in the ring," said De La Hoya, who 
celebrated his 21st birthday on Feb. 4. "I'd watch a fight on TV and say, 'God, 
I wish that was me in there.' " . . . 
</P>
<P>
 For his return, he has been selected by promoter Bob Arum to reopen the 
downtown arena where De La Hoya's father and grandfather fought with a lot less 
fanfare. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel honored," he said. "I'm going to put on a good performance. I'll have 
to. I remember a lot of fighters being booed there. That won't happen to me." . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, there is no De La Hoya paranoia. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 At No. 15 in the Associated Press poll, UCLA (18-3) is ranked behind 10 teams 
that have more losses. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Although Arizona is ranked ninth, one reason the Bruins aren't getting much 
respect is that only one Pacific 10 Conference team has reached the Final Four 
in the last 13 NCAA tournaments. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Now is the time for the Bruins, who will face California tonight and Stanford 
on Saturday at Pauley Pavilion, to put up or shut up. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Cal probably will be the only team to have two NBA draft lottery picks this 
year -- guard Jason Kidd and forward Lamond Murray. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan Richardson of Arkansas, Lon Kruger of Florida and Norm Stewart of 
Missouri are among those deserving coach-of-the-year consideration. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After the San Antonio Spurs' loss against the Utah Jazz on Wednesday night, 
Dennis Rodman has 947 rebounds and 219 points. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Warrior guard Latrell Sprewell has blocked more shots than centers Brad 
Daugherty, Rik Smits or Kevin Willis. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Best player available before the March 21 NHL trade deadline -- that's some 
deadline, three weeks before the end of the regular season -- might be Quebec 
center Mike Ricci. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 For the record: Jimmy Carter became the first fighter to win a title in the 
same division three times when he regained the lightweight championship in 
1954. William (Bird) Averitt of Pepperdine was the first local player to lead 
the NCAA Division I in scoring when he averaged 33.9 in 1972-73. We forgot to 
put Elvin Hayes on our all-NBA Presidents' Day team. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Buss will be honored by the Michael Cooper Foundation and the L.A. City 
College Foundation/Associated Students Organization at the Regent Beverly 
Wilshire Hotel on March 25. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It appears that Kent Desormeaux, who had been on a tear at Santa Anita until 
he called in sick Wednesday, will win the only important Southern California 
riding title that has eluded him. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most talented young sportscasters around is Kurt Hoover, co-host of 
the Santa Anita inter-track telecasts. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Nine figure skaters probably will wear knee pads at practice today in Norway.

SWIMMING / PACIFIC 10 CHAMPIONSHIPS; STANFORD WOMEN FAVORED TO EXTEND THEIR 
TITLE STREAK 
</P>

<P>
 Two-time defending NCAA champion Stanford is favored to win yet another title 
in the Pacific 10 Conference women's swimming championships, which begin today 
at the Belmont Plaza Olympic Pool in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary heats will be held at 11 a.m. and finals at 6 p.m. today, Friday 
and Saturday.The 500-yard freestyle, 200 individual medley, 50 freestyle and 
two relays -- the 200 freestyle and 400 medley -- are scheduled today. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-ranked Cardinal has won every Pac-10 women's swimming title since the 
first conference championships in 1987. Last year, Stanford won 10 of 13 
individual events and all five relays. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford's biggest challenge likely will come from sixth-ranked UCLA. Bruin 
sophomore Richelle Depold will defend her title in the 50 freestyle against 
Olympian Jenny Thompson of Stanford.  
</P>
<P>
 USC, which beat UCLA, 163-135, in a Feb. 12 dual meet, also should win several 
individual titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Trojan freshman Kristine Quance, who won the 400 individual medley at the 1993 
Pan Pacific Games, will compete in the 200 IM today, the 100 breaststroke 
Friday and the 200 breaststroke Saturday. WENDY WITHERSPOON

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI: EYES OF TEXAS ARE ON BIG EIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As expected, the Big Eight invited Southwest Conference heavyweights Texas and 
Texas A&M to join the league in 1996-97. SWC little brothers Texas Tech and 
Baylor, who would have screamed bloody murder had they been left out of the 
mix, also received invitations. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the fun part: What to do? 
</P>
<P>
 With no College Football Assn. television contract after the '95 season, the 
SWC is a footnote waiting to happen. Even if the proposed merger falls 
through--and trust us, it won't--the SWC is doomed. Texas and Texas A&M are 
going to leave; it's simply a matter of where they'll go. Today it's the Big 
Eight. A year from now, it could be the Pacific 10, the Southeastern Conference 
or the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happens, Rice, Texas Christian, Southern Methodist and Houston aren't 
coming along for the ride. The four SWC members already have been told they 
aren't part of the new world order. In fact, the whole merger was arranged 
without SWC Commissioner Steve Hatchell and the assorted SWC athletic 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
 A possible new partner for the pink-slipped four: the Western Athletic 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Texas and Texas A&M are stuck. For now. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a source familiar with the negotiations, the presidents of the 
two schools met with Texas Gov. Ann Richards earlier this week and were told in 
no uncertain terms that any merger deal would have to include Baylor and Texas 
Tech. Such is Texas politics. 
</P>
<P>
 In a perfect world, Texas would love to join the Pac-10 and Texas A&M would 
opt for the SEC. Instead, the Longhorns and the Aggies are headed toward the 
Big Eight, which sure beats the sorry SWC. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing is written in stone. If Baylor, which soon could have all sorts of 
NCAA investigation problems, and Texas Tech eventually drop out of the Big 
Eight alliance, the Longhorns and the Aggies would be free to bolt in a Texas 
two-step. 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, the Big Eight breathes easier. That's because Colorado 
probably will stay put (sorry, Pac-10), as will Missouri (the Tigers have made 
lots of noise about joining the Big Ten). 
</P>
<P>
 The downside for the Big Eight? Having to take Baylor and Texas Tech. Good 
evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to tonight's exciting Texas 
Tech-Iowa State matchup . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In short, we have seen the future. It is the dawning of super-conferences. 
</P>
<P>
 Get used to it. CAREER DAY 
</P>
<P>
 Manchester, Ind., is so small that the closest thing to graffiti is when some 
lovestruck high schooler carves his sweetheart's name on a tree trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is where former Indiana star Steve Alford chose to begin his coaching 
career, a gamble that could soon see him move from the obscurity of Division 
III, where athletic scholarships are unheard of, to the bright lights of 
Division I. 
</P>
<P>
 Alford, forever a legend in the state, became Manchester College's coach eight 
games into the 1991-92 season. The team was 0-8 then, and finished 4-24. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Manchester (enrollment 1,000) finished 20-8, setting a school 
record for most victories. This year, Alford's team is 21-3 and regular-season 
conference champions for the first time in the college's history. One of the 
three losses was an 11-point defeat by Division I member Ball State, currently 
tied for second place in the Mid-American Conference. The other loss came on a 
buzzer beater. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic directors and search committees notice this sort of thing. If they 
don't, they might want to start. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard not to sit around and think about (a Division I) job," Alford said. 
"I have no idea what timetable there is. I do know the institution here has 
been very good to me." 
</P>
<P>
 And vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 Alford, whose brief NBA career lasted several uneventful seasons, could have 
gone the conventional route: Take a Division I assistant's job and hope. 
Instead, he took a chance on Manchester. And Manchester took a chance on him. 
</P>
<P>
 The results? 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I'm in a position now that I don't have to jump at the first Division 
I opportunity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alford has yet to hear from his former coach, Bob Knight, this season. Then 
again, Alford has a better record. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the last time the two talked, Knight wanted to know if Alford would 
be interested in appearing in the movie, "Blue Chips." Alford, contrary to what 
he did during his playing career, decided to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 A filming footnote: Rather than accept a fee for his work in the movie, Knight 
asked Paramount to donate money to the Indiana University library fund. If you 
combine the Paramount check and money raised at a reception before last week's 
Bloomington premiere, the total was about $85,000. Also, director William 
Friedkin, who attended the premiere, endowed a basketball scholarship at the 
school. It will be called, "The Red Auerbach-Pete Newell Basketball 
Scholarship." Cost: about $150,000. WAR OF WORDS 
</P>
<P>
 Is everyone taking cheap shots at UCLA, or does it just seem that way? 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona's recent rout of the Bruins didn't go unnoticed on the East Coast. 
Said Temple's John Chaney: "You would figure looking at all that talent, you 
wouldn't say they would win, but you'd figure it would be closer than 20." 
</P>
<P>
 And this from North Carolina's Dean Smith, who still seemed in shock over 
Notre Dame's Feb. 6 victory over the Bruins: "What (the Irish) did to UCLA 
wasn't even close." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona Coach Lute Olson, one of the foremost experts on postseason choke 
collars, hasn't wasted much time planting the psychological seeds. After the 
lopsided victory over the Bruins, Olson popped off about teams feeling pressure 
. . . blah, blah, blah. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson would know. The Wildcats couldn't make it past the first round of the 
NCAA tournament in 1993 or '92, losing to underdogs Santa Clara and East 
Tennessee State, respectively. At least, the Bruins advanced to the final eight 
in '92 and reached the second round last season. THE REST 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the NCAA tournament selection committee are keeping a close watch 
on the weekly RPI ratings, which measure, among other things, strength of 
schedule and quality of victories and losses. The latest top-10 RPI rankings: 
Missouri, Purdue, Michigan, Arizona, Temple, Louisville, North Carolina, Duke, 
Arkansas and Kansas. The latest conference rankings: Big 10, Atlantic Coast, 
Big Eight, Metro, Big East, Atlantic 10, Great Midwest, Southeastern, Pacific 
10 and Western Athletic. Said Duke Athletic Director Tom Butters, who begins 
his sixth and final year as chairman of the selection committee: "Parity is the 
word. It was the word last year. It is this year. I suspect it is for years to 
come." . . . After serving a one-game suspension for threatening Massachusetts 
Coach John Calipari, an apologetic John Chaney faces UMass tonight at Temple's 
McGonigle Hall, which is nothing more than an oversized high school gym, 
capacity 3,900. "It certainly was a tough week in a sense of watching my team 
go out and play a basketball game," Chaney said. "It was the first time in my 
career I was without a team." . . . Federal mediators continue to play calendar 
tag with the NCAA and the Black Coaches Assn. According to a U.S. Justice 
Department official, both sides are having a difficult time finding a date that 
fits everyone's schedule. Nor does it help that Colorado President Judith 
Albino, the chairperson of the powerful Presidents Commission, is fighting to 
keep her job back on the Boulder campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring some wondrous late-season rush, Georgia will be an NCAA tournament 
no-show. But if nothing else, Bulldog Coach Hugh Durham has solved the mystery 
of why free-throw percentages are down this season. "Everybody slaps skin," he 
said. "Rather than concentrating on making (free throws), you have to think 
about high fives." Then again, you could do what Kentucky did in its recent 
victory over Vanderbilt: Cheat. Twice in the second half, the Wildcats switched 
players at the foul line and got away with it. Walter McCarty (51.2% on free 
throws) sneaked in for Andre Riddick (31.8%), and Gimel Martinez (80.5%) 
replaced Jared Prickett (54.9%). McCarty and Martinez made three of the four 
attempts. . . . Khary Stanley, a 6-foot-11 sophomore center from Lynwood, has 
left Drake and returned home to attend to unspecified "family problems." Drake 
Coach Rudy Washington told Stanley his scholarship would be available next 
season if he chooses to return to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a soft nonconference schedule specifically designed for lots of 
victories and an NCAA bid, Florida State (12-11) has been reduced to one hope. 
"Right now, our shot's got to be the (ACC) tournament," Seminole Coach Pat 
Kennedy said. An automatic bid goes to the conference tournament winner. 
According to Kennedy, who studies these sorts of things, four marquee programs 
have been wrecked by injuries, graduation or early departures: Florida State 
(25-10 last season), Utah (12-12 this season, 24-7 in 1992-93), Seton Hall 
(13-10/28-7) and Iowa (10-11/23-9). . . . Kentucky Coach Rick Pitino isn't 
kidding when he says the four best backcourts in the country include Arizona 
(Khalid Reeves, Damon Stoudamire), Arkansas (Corey Beck, Clint McDaniel), 
Florida ( Dan Cross, Craig Brown) and a Bay Area twosome (Hint: It isn't Cal's 
Jason Kidd and whoever). The answer: San Francisco's Orlando Smart and Gerald 
Walker. 
</P>
<P>
 Alford, who in years past has been critical of Indiana guard Damon Bailey's 
inability to take full advantage of the Hoosiers' motion offense, has a revised 
view: "He's definitely stepped things up. With (Calbert) Cheaney and (Greg) 
Graham gone, he sees his role being increased. He's had a very good career." 
Bailey averaged 10.1 points a game last season, 21.6 points this season. He'll 
probably finish his career as the fifth-leading scorer in Hoosier history, no 
small feat. . . . North Carolina's Smith was full of opinions this week. His 
choice for No. 1: Duke. "The more I see of them, they might be the best team," 
he said. His choice for American League rookie of the year: Michael Jordan. 
"Don't ever say he can't do something," Smith said. He later added, "I would 
never sell Michael short if he says this is his goal. He loves to do things 
that people say he can't." The Top 10

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL; USC HAS TOUGH TEST AGAINST STANFORD TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cheryl Miller will have a better idea after tonight whether her USC women's 
basketball team will win the Pacific 10 championship the easy way, the hard way 
or maybe not at all.  
</P>
<P>
 The sixth-ranked Trojans have a two-game conference lead, but must play 
Stanford at Maples Pavilion, where USC hasn't won since 1988. Moreover, 
Stanford has won 101 of its last 104 home games.  
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans (12-1 in the Pac-10, 19-2 overall) and Stanford (9-3, 16-5) met 
four weeks ago in Los Angeles, where Stanford lost twice on the same weekend 
for the first time in six years. USC defeated the Cardinal, 81-73, and UCLA did 
likewise, 80-73. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA (9-4, 14-8) faces California (2-10, 8-14) at Berkeley tonight, and 
travels to Stanford on Saturday night, when USC plays at Cal.  
</P>
<P>
 With only four games remaining after tonight -- against Cal, UCLA, Oregon and 
Oregon State -- USC could virtually wrap up the title tonight with a victory 
over a Stanford team that has rebounded significantly since its losses in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Tara VanDerveer's Cardinal started this season with lowered 
expectations, but at Stanford that can still mean a top-10 team. And it is 
ranked 11th this week.  
</P>
<P>
 Stanford has won two of the last four national championships and has been to 
three of the last four Final Fours. The women outdrew the men last season and 
have a chance to do it again. Stanford is expecting close to a 7,500 sellout 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 USC is hopeful, but Miller acknowledged the scope of the challenge. "It'll be 
our biggest win yet, if we can get it," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It would be huge. If we beat them up there, we'd leave them with a message if 
we have to play them again in the regionals. It's tough to beat a good team 
three times, but we'll die trying, if we have to." 
</P>
<P>
 She was referring to the NCAA West Regionals at Stanford on March 24-26. As 
the host team, the Cardinal figures as a near-certain participant and USC as a 
likely, though not certain, entrant in the four-team tournament.  
</P>
<P>
 The winner will advance to the Women's Final Four at Richmond, Va., April 2-3. 
Pairings for the 64-team tournament will be announced on March 13.  
</P>
<P>
 Miller's challenge tonight appears troublesome on multiple fronts: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stanford has beaten USC in 11 of its last 13 meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stanford has won five in a row since losing to USC by an average margin of 
29 points. Most recently, Stanford handed Cal the worst defeat in its history, 
111-64. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stanford has made 70 three-pointers in its last 10 games and is shooting 
45% from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
 Conceivably, both Miller and UCLA Coach Kathy Olivier could take their teams 
to the playoffs in their coaching debuts. UCLA has won four in a row since 
losing at USC, 85-70, on Feb. 4.  
</P>
<P>
 And just as 6-foot-5 senior Lisa Leslie has powered USC all season, 6-1 senior 
Natalie Williams has done the same for the Bruins. Probably the country's most 
dominating rebounder, Williams broke the conference record with 25 rebounds 
against Arizona State on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 She ranks fifth nationally in rebounding with an average of 13.5 a game and 
sixth in scoring at 23.5 points.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stop here if you've heard this before, but USC will launch yet another 
feasibility study on building an on-campus basketball arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Leslie, for one, has heard this before. 
</P>
<P>
 "When USC recruited me, they said I'd be playing in an arena here by my 
sophomore year," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The USC men's and women's teams practice in an antiquated gym upstairs in the 
old USC physical education building, built in the 1920s, and where the 
baselines are dangerously close to the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 The men play in the Sports Arena, which can be a dangerous late-night walk for 
students. The women play in Lyon Center, a high school-size facility that was 
built primarily to serve student recreational needs. For intercollegiate 
athletics, it doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 No concession sales are permitted, for one thing. For another, there have been 
repeated instances of student security personnel tossing reporters who were 
writing on deadline out of the building at "closing time."  
</P>
<P>
 Athletic Director Mike Garrett will form a committee this spring to examine 
the cost and possible sites for a facility. One proposal to be discussed: 
Gutting the PE building, retaining the exterior and building a 7,500-seat arena 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Stanford women's basketball program has become second to none in recent 
seasons, and the Cardinal's recent signings indicate that VanDerveer could keep 
it going to the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the six freshmen VanDerveer has recruited, two are considered possibly 1-2 
in the country in talent. They are 6-2 Kristin Folkl of St. Louis, who can dunk 
with the tallest of them, and 6-7 Chandra Benton of Lake Oswego, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 The others are 6-2 Olympia Scott of St. Bernard, called one of the best 
prospects in Southern California; 6-4 Heather Owen of Moscow, Ida.; 6-3 Naomi 
Mulitauaopele of Seattle, and 6-0 Regan Freuen of Spokane, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 Folkl is a two-sport athlete, in basketball and volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not only the best freshman group we've brought in, but the biggest," 
VanDerveer said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Stanford needed much help. Its two top players this season, 6-5 Anita 
Kaplan and 6-3 Rachel Hemmer, are juniors. There is only one senior on this 
team, and of the top nine players, four are freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Women's Basketball Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford's women are averaging 4,447 fans a game, the men 4,747. But the 
women's most attractive games are yet to come -- USC tonight, UCLA on Saturday 
and Washington on March 12. . . . Stanford and Washington are 1-2 in Pac-10 
women's attendance, with the Huskies averaging 4,416 a game. Arizona is third 
with a 1,743 average. 
</P>
<P>
 Marianne Stanley, the former USC women's basketball coach who sued last summer 
over a contract dispute with Athletic Director Mike Garrett, is a part-time 
women's basketball marketing director for Stanford basketball. While she awaits 
a trial date on her case, she's also looking for a coaching job, and Stanford 
Coach Tara VanDerveer has encouraged her to seek a men's coaching job, as well 
as a women's opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the Pac-10 ruling on the Feb. 3 Washington State-Arizona State game, 
which wasn't played because the flu left only four healthy WSU players able to 
play: The game was ruled a forfeit, giving the Sun Devils (1-12) their only 
victory. Washington State is 2-11. . . . VanDerveer said Jody Runge of Oregon 
will get her vote for Pac-10 coach-of-the-year honors. In her first year, 
Runge's team has clinched a winning season, after the Ducks finished 3-15 in 
the conference and 9-18 overall last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Comparing USC's Lisa Leslie and UCLA's Natalie Williams: Leslie is averaging 
22.1 points and 12.3 rebounds a game, and has 52 assists, 64 blocks and 52 
steals. Williams is averaging 23.5 points and 13.5 rebounds, and has 31 
assists, 20 blocks and 71 steals. . . . Leslie and Trojan freshman Tina 
Thompson have 259 and 219 rebounds, respectively. No other USC player has more 
than 84. In the Pac-10, Leslie ranks behind only Williams, and Thompson is 
fourth, behind Cal's Ingrid Dixson.  
</P>
<P>
 VanDerveer, on the aftermath of Stanford's Jan. 30 loss at USC: "I told them 
the S on their jerseys stood for stupid . And I included the coaches in that, 
too. We weren't playing or coaching well then. I'm much happier with how we're 
playing now." . . . Two Stanford players USC doesn't want at the free-throw 
line tonight: Christy Hedgpeth, who has made 84.6%, and Kate Starbird, who has 
made 81.9%. They rank 1-2 in the Pac-10.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; FREE THROWS END UP SPARKING KENTUCKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kentucky was short two starters, a top reserve and about 28 points a game at 
Knoxville, Tenn., where the Volunteers have been short all season. 
</P>
<P>
 Travis Ford, Jared Prickett and Gimel Martinez were back in Lexington, Ky., 
suspended by Coach Rick Pitino for one game because of some gamesmanship -- 
they had been detected shooting free throws for lesser-talented teammates in a 
victory over Vanderbilt four days before. 
</P>
<P>
 What better time for a Tennessee upset? 
</P>
<P>
 The Volunteers (5-18, 2-11 Southeastern) gave it a shot, leading by 14 points 
in the second half before falling, 77-73, to seventh-ranked Kentucky (21-5, 
10-3). 
</P>
<P>
 The reason? Free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodrick Rhodes scored all 13 of his points from the line, including Kentucky's 
last seven, with at least three teammates breathing a collective -- and 
long-distance -- sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 The three can step lighter thanks to Tony Delk (21 points), Andre Riddick (18 
points) and Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm almost as proud of this team as I was for our 31-point comeback at LSU," 
Pitino said. "Offensively we were stymied. We didn't have a sub at the (guard) 
positions. We had some scary combinations out there." 
</P>
<P>
 No. 2 Duke 84, Florida St. 72 -- Sparked by the outside shooting of Chris 
Collins and Marty Clark, the Blue Devils (20-3, 11-3 Atlantic Coast) rallied in 
the second half at Tallahassee, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind, 45-40, at halftime, Duke adjusted to a four-guard lineup by Florida 
State (12-12, 5-9) and used a 26-4 advantage at the foul line for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 4 North Carolina 80, Notre Dame 71 -- Eric Montross scored 23 points at 
South Bend, Ind., to lead the Tar Heels (22-5) in what was, for him, a sort of 
homecoming. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina tries to play a game near the home town of each of its seniors 
and ran into a problem with the Irish (10-16), near Montross' home in 
Indianapolis, until the final four minutes, when Notre Dame went without a 
field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 6 Missouri 83, SE Missouri 61 -- Melvin Booker scored 17 points, including 
11 in a span of 1:35, in a nonconference victory for the Tigers (21-2) over the 
Indians (9-15) at Columbia, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska 96, No. 10 Kansas 87 -- Eric Piatkowski scored 33 points, including 
four in the final seconds, and the Cornhuskers (15-8, 5-6 Big Eight) sent the 
Jayhawks (21-6, 6-5) to their third consecutive loss, fourth in a row at 
Lincoln, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 13 Louisville 82, Louisiana State 64 -- Clifford Rozier had 23 points and 
15 rebounds at Louisville, Ky., as the Cardinals (21-4) snapped a two-game 
losing streak. It was the fifth consecutive loss for LSU (11-12). 
</P>
<P>
 No. 14 Purdue 95, Ohio St. 85 -- Glenn Robinson scored 40 points, 20 on free 
throws, and the Boilermakers (22-4, 10-4 Big Ten) held the Buckeyes (11-14, 
4-10) to five points in the last four minutes at Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 18 Syracuse 91, Seton Hall 69 -- Lawrence Moten had 25 points and Lucious 
Jackson broke out of a seven-game scoring slump with 19 for the Orangemen 
(18-5, 10-5 Big East) over the Pirates (13-11, 6-10) at Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 19 Saint Louis 70, Cincinnati 67 -- Erwin Claggett hit a three-pointer 
from the corner with 1:40 to play and the Billikens (21-3, 7-3 Great Midwest) 
overcame 33 points by LaZelle Durden of Cincinnati (17-9, 5-5) at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan St. 85, No. 20 Minnesota 68 -- Shawn Respert tied a school record 
with eight three-point baskets and scored 43 points to lead the Spartans 
(16-10, 7-7 Big Ten) over the Gophers (18-9, 8-6) at East Lansing, Mich.

LILLEHAMMER / '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; LOOKING OUT OF ITS LEAGUE, U.S. GOES DOWN 
FIGHTING; HOCKEY: AMERICANS FAIL TO CONVERT EARLY SCORING CHANCES AND 
FORMIDABLE FINLAND WINS QUARTERFINAL GAME, 6-1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 They barely could keep up with the Swedes and Finns, Canadians and Slovaks, 
desperately clutching and grabbing the smallest hope of winning an Olympic 
medal. When that was pulled from their grasp Wednesday, players on the U.S. 
hockey team shared a deep sense of loss and the disappointment of not having 
played their best on center stage. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fourth consecutive Games, the U.S. hockey entry will go home without a 
medal. The last qualifier for the quarterfinals after posting a 1-1-3 
round-robin record, the U.S. was eliminated from playoff competition quickly 
Wednesday, losing, 6-1, to a formidable and apparently fearless Finnish team. 
</P>
<P>
 Finland (6-0) will play Canada in the semifinals Friday, while the Americans 
play two games to determine fifth through eighth places, starting today against 
the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 "When something you strived for, for such a long time, you just can't get your 
hands on it anymore, it's really a feeling of emptiness," forward Peter 
Ciavaglia said. "I'm sure we're all going to think for a long time about what 
we could have done. It's not going to get any better lying in bed tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you work so hard to reach something, and now you can't, it's certainly 
frustrating that it slipped away, and it happened so fast." 
</P>
<P>
 The game plan Wednesday was to test Finland's newfound confidence. The U.S. 
had the better early scoring chances and might have forced Finland to rally for 
the first time in the tournament had Ted Drury converted his breakaway in the 
first three minutes but goaltender Jarmo Myllys turned away that shot with his 
left knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Myllys, who has won as many games here -- four -- as he won in four NHL 
seasons with Minnesota and San Jose, also stopped a 25-foot shot by Brian 
Rolston with his stick at 5:25. 
</P>
<P>
 Although neither he nor Jukka Tammi had faced more than 14 shots in their 
previous five games, he was impressive against 12 shots in the first period. He 
kept Finland in the game until the Americans, as has been their habit here and 
through pre-Olympic play, took unnecessary and costly penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 And so a good beginning Wednesday turned into a bad ending, making the final 
image of this team one of unruly children. Finland converted four of its seven 
power plays, each time on penalties that involved excessive violence. The 
ugliest moment occurred with 3:24 to play and the outcome long since settled, 
when U.S. players pummeled Vesa Erik Hammalainen in a skirmish in front of the 
U.S. bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course it was not so nice to see at the end, but I can excuse them for 
that," Finnish Coach Curt Lindstrom said. "I think that team normally has a big 
will to win and when they saw that chance (fail), they tried provocation. Also, 
there was more hooking and holding today because the Finnish team today was 
quicker and faster." 
</P>
<P>
 Faster, stronger and soaring higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were taken out of our game plan by a good Finnish team and ourselves," 
U.S. Coach Tim Taylor said. "In the first part of the first period, we were 
playing the kind of hockey we knew we had to play. If we could have kept 
Finland on edge. . . . There was history. They haven't always had strong 
confidence. If we had kept them on edge, we would have had a chance to win. But 
they got a comfortable lead and it was over." 
</P>
<P>
 That lead was 1-0 after Saku Koivu, Montreal's top draft pick last June, 
rebounded a shot by Jere Lehtinen after U.S. right winger John Lilley was 
penalized for charging. The lead grew to 2-0 when Esa Keskinen tipped the puck 
away from Craig Johnson at center ice and sent Mika Nieminen in on a 
short-handed breakaway, an opportunity made even easier when defenseman Barry 
Richter inexplicably dashed for the bench before being replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I slept my two hours last night and was dreaming of winning," Lindstrom said. 
"I thought we had a good chance to win (and) when we scored our second goal, my 
nerves were better." 
</P>
<P>
 His nerves were frayed a bit when David Sacco cut Finland's lead to 2-1, 54 
seconds into the second period. Sacco recorded the Americans' first 
short-handed goal of the tournament off a give-and-go with Jeff Lazaro, but 
they were unable to sustain that surge. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Finland resumed pressuring the U.S. defense and intercepted a 
clearing pass Chris Imes had banged off the boards to set up Nieminen's 
close-in goal at 4:05. With Matt Martin off for roughing Hannu Virta, Finland 
padded its lead to 4-1 at 6:21 as Virta lifted a shot over a diving Travis 
Richards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting that quick goal in the second period when we were shorthanded was a 
real boost, but then we were victimized by our penalties and we kept getting 
ourselves out of sync," Taylor said. "The result tonight is the result of not 
only the good play of Finland but our propensity for taking penalties." 
</P>
<P>
 With a staunch defense and the Americans' tendency to self-destruct, Finland 
was hardly challenged the rest of the game. The challenge for the Americans now 
is to end the tournament as respectably as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a young team and I think we gave it our all," Rolston said. "I don't 
think we played as well as we did during the tour. Did we have stage fright? 
That's possible. I don't think we came at teams the way we could have, but I 
don't think there's an explanation for why we didn't play as well as we could 
have." 
</P>
<P>
 Said goalie Garth Snow: "When we came here, we wanted to win the gold medal. 
Our expectations were pretty high for ourselves and I'm sure the expectations 
for people back home were pretty high, too. It's a long season and to come up 
with nothing is disappointing for all of us. We had higher expectations than 
this and when you don't reach them, you're definitely not satisfied."

 Alexander Vinogradov whipped a wrist shot past Slovakian goaltender Eduard 
Hartmann with 1:21 left in overtime Wednesday, giving Russia a 3-2 victory and 
a berth in Friday's semifinals against Sweden (4-1-1). Russia is 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's predecessors, the Soviet Union and Commonwealth of Independent 
States, won a medal in every Olympic hockey tournament since they began 
competing in 1956. Eight were gold.

 On the theory that extraordinary athletes deserve extraordinary medal 
ceremonies, the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee came up with a unique 
victory rostrum for these Games. 
</P>
<P>
 The podium on which skiers, ski jumpers and other winners stand to receive 
their medals was carved out of a 600-year old block of ice taken from the 
Jostedal Glacier, an idea contributed by architect Ketil Moe of the LOOC's 
design office. 
</P>
<P>
 "For hundreds of years local people have made use of these chunks of glacial 
ice for their households and the fish industry," Moe told the official Olympic 
newspaper, Hugin. "Thus, glaciers play a role in the everyday life of many 
Norwegians." 
</P>
<P>
 Lights were placed below the block, creating an impression that the medalists 
are floating. And lest these Olympians slip, there's an aluminum grid embedded 
in the surface to give them traction. 
</P>

 Finland's hockey coach, Curt Lindstrom, owns a betting parlor in Stockholm, 
his hometown. The action is usually confined to horse racing and soccer, but he 
makes exceptions -- and makes bets, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindstrom made a wager on his own Olympic team but said it was "a long time 
before the tournament. No betting during the tournament."  
</P>
<P>
 Asked how much he had wagered, he got coy. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some people, two crowns is a lot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressed again, he again declined to specify the amount. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife can hear it," he said. HELENE ELLIOTT

 Skier Jeremy Nobis finally lived up to expectations with his ninth-place 
finish in the men's giant slalom.  
</P>
<P>
 It was only the third top-10 finish in Nobis' international career. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, Nobis won an Olympic sibling rivalry with his younger sister, 
Shannon, who was 10th in last week's super-G. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a little motivation to nip her, huh?" Nobis said. "Can't let my 
little sister beat me in the Olympics. Got her by one."

 The U.S. giant slalom skiers performed just about as expected. Paul Casey 
Puckett went out in the first run, Harper Phillips in the second and Erik 
Schlopy wound up 34th, last among skiers who completed two runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlopy's time was affected because he missed a gate on the first run and had 
to hike back up the hill to ski it again. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlopy is not without a sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also entered in Sunday's slalom and wanted to pass along a prediction to 
a certain, flamboyant, Italian skiing star. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, Tomba's mine!" Schlopy said.

 What did Germany's Markus Wasmeier, the gold-medal winner in the giant slalom, 
do in between runs Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, I warmed up my feet," he said. "It was real cold." 
</P>
<P>
 Wasmeier also arrived for the second run about half an hour early, not knowing 
the starting time had been moved from 1 p.m. to 1:30. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was confused," Wasmeier said. "So I passed my time with some free skiing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Germans weren't particularly supportive of Wasmeier after he had finished 36th 
in the Olympic downhill. But after winning gold in the giant slalom and 
super-G, it seems everyone's his friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are shaking my shoulders and congratulating me," Wasmeier 
said. "But you know who your friends are. I made the distinction of who they 
were with me." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The U.S. women might have three medal contenders in today's giant slalom in 
Heidi Voelker, Eva Twardokens and Diann Roffe-Steinrotter. 
</P>
<P>
 Roffe-Steinrotter would not have been considered among the favorites in this 
event before her surprising gold-medal victory in super-G. CHRIS DUFRESNE

 Myriam Bedard of Canada won her second gold medal in biathlon here Wednesday 
and Russian Sergei Tchepikov won his first. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedard, who became the first North American to win an Olympic biathlon last 
Friday in the 15-kilometer event, won the women's 7.5-kilometer sprint by 1.1 
seconds, the closest finish in women's Olympic history. She missed twice on the 
rifle range and finished in 26 minutes 8.8 seconds, nosing out Svetlana 
Paramygina of Belarus. Paramygina also missed twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Valentyna Tserbe of Ukraine won the bronze when Inna Sheshikl of Kazakhstan 
fell two yards from the finish. 
</P>
<P>
 The race included two stops at the range for a round each of prone and 
standing shooting. A penalty lap was skied for each miss. 
</P>
<P>
 In the men's race, a 10-kilometer sprint, Tchepikov's perfect shooting put him 
in prime position, then he skiied a fast final segment and knocked Ricco Gross 
of Germany out of the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Tchepikov and Gross shot clean in their two visits to the range, five 
shots each prone and standing. But Tchepikov, who was third in this race at 
Calgary in 1988, finished in 28 minutes 7 seconds, six seconds faster than 
Gross. Sergei Tarasov, also of Russia, winner of the 20k last Sunday, won the 
bronze. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Japan practically assured itself of the gold medal in team Nordic combined, 
taking a big lead over Norway in the ski jumping portion off the normal hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Takanori Kono's 330-foot jump, the longest in either the individual or team 
combined event, helped Japan to a 61.5-point lead, which means the Japanese 
will start today's 30-kilometer cross-country relay with better than a 
five-minute advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 In the team event, each team's jumpers get two jumps. Kono jumped 310-2 on his 
second try, then Kenji Ogiwara gave Japan another boost with a second jump of 
316-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan finished the day with 733.5 points to 672 for Norway and 643.5 for 
Switzerland. Thursday's relay race will determine the medals. 
</P>
<P>
 Norway's Fred Borre Lundberg, winner of the individual competition last week, 
jumped 267-4 and 283-9 Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team was seventh among the 12 teams with 602 points and will start 
the relay 10 minutes 57 seconds behind. MIKE KUPPER

 Second baseman Torey Lovullo unpacked in the Angel clubhouse at Tempe, Ariz., 
on Wednesday, but instead of fretting about a starting job, he said he was 
grateful to be alive. 
</P>
<P>
 His Northridge home was hit the hardest of all the Angels' residences in the 
Jan. 17 earthquake, and certainly, no one was more scared.  
</P>
<P>
 Lovullo, who moved out of his home and spent all but the last three days 
living in Dana Point, is not sure he will move back. He remembers the fear of 
furniture crashing around the bassinet of his 2-month-old son. If they had not 
moved it a week earlier, he hates to envision what might have happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was terrified," said Lovullo, who actually broke one of his wife's ribs 
while reaching for his son. "I don't think I'll ever forget something like 
this."

 Ted Updike, agent for right fielder Tim Salmon, confirmed Wednesday that they 
are progressing toward a three-year deal with the Angels. "I feel pretty good 
about the thing right now," Updike said. Salmon is expected to get about $4 
million for the three years. . . . Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi talked 
with agent Arn Tellem in an attempt to sign starter Mark Langston to at least a 
three-year contract extension. . . . Reliever Scott Lewis signed a one-year 
contract, leaving the Angels with five unsigned players. Bavasi has given them 
-- Salmon, Chad Curtis, Gary DiSarcina, Damion Easley and Mike Butcher -- a 
March 3 deadline to reach a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels' first full-squad workout will be held today with hitters facing 
major league pitchers for the first time this spring. BOB NIGHTENGALE

and is expected in camp today. Sharperson would be available if the Dodgers 
need an extra infielder. . . . Former UCLA football coach Tommy Prothro, who 
lives in Memphis, Tenn., visited with Lasorda on Wednesday at Dodgertown while 
on vacation in Florida. "I called him a while ago and he was very ill, so it 
was so good to see him feeling well," Lasorda said.

 Darren Dreifort was sharp while pitching batting practice here for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's put it this way, facing him on the second day is not the way you want 
to start spring training," Eric Karros said. "He's got a lot of movement on the 
ball and he's got a good slider; all he needs to work on is his location." 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Worrell also pitched batting practice for the second time and said he 
feels good, but may cut back his throwing on the side to feel fresh on the 
mound. Worrell has been on the mound every other day and on the side in 
between.

 Delino DeShields, socks stretched to his knees, said it hasn't hit him yet 
that he's playing for the Dodgers instead of the Montreal Expos. Tim Wallach, 
DeShields' teammate for three years in Montreal, assured him it would all fall 
in place in a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallach, who worked out all winter at Dodger Stadium, looks agile and loose 
and is hitting the ball well. MARYANN HUDSON

NBA ROUNDUP; WILKINS A DISTRACTION TO SEATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If it was Dominique Wilkins' final night in an Atlanta Hawk uniform, he went 
out in style. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seattle SuperSonics probably wished if he was going to be traded, why 
hadn't the process been rushed along a little quicker? 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, rumored going several places before tonight's trading deadline, went 
to the basket in the fourth quarter in Atlanta, scoring nine points in a 19-0 
run in a 99-92 victory over Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We let them wake up, and they did," Seattle Coach George Karl said after 
watching his team blow a 13-point fourth-quarter lead to Wilkins, Mookie 
Blaylock and Craig Ehlo, who scored all 19 points in the rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Payton led the SuperSonics with 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very emotional win," said Wilkins, who can be a free agent at the 
end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever happens happens," he said. "Whatever way it goes, I'll be in a great 
situation. It's been a big distraction for me and, I think, the team as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 106, San Antonio 102 -- The Spurs' franchise-record 13-game winning 
streak came to an end as Karl Malone and John Stockton each scored 31 points 
for the Jazz in a double-overtime victory at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Spurs' first loss since Jan. 20 and their third loss in as many 
games against Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Stockton and Jeff Malone each scored six points in the second overtime, and 
Utah took the lead for good on a layup by Stockton that made it 97-95. 
</P>
<P>
 David Robinson led San Antonio with 25 points and 16 rebounds. Dale Ellis 
scored 15 points, including a three-pointer with 6.2 seconds left in regulation 
that sent the game into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver 102, Boston 94 -- LaPhonso Ellis scored a career-high 29 points and 
Dikembe Mutombo led the Nuggets' defense with 16 rebounds and six of the team's 
21 blocked shots as they sent the Celtics to their 10th loss in a row, tying a 
franchise record set in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Williams finished with 18 points and Mutombo and Bryant Stith each 
scored 16 for Denver, which won for the fourth time in five games. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Fox led the Celtics with 20 points, Sherman Douglas had 17, Dino Radja 16 
and Acie Earl 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 123, Golden State 100 -- Pete Myers scored 20 of his career-high 26 
points in the first half at Chicago, where the Bulls ended the Warriors' 
winning streak at six games. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 106, Philadelphia 102 -- Kenny Anderson had 29 points and 11 
assists and Derrick Coleman added 18 points and nine rebounds at Philadelphia, 
sending the 76ers to their seventh consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 103, Indiana 99 -- Shaquille O'Neal overcame a knee injury scare and 
scored 28 points at Orlando, which won for the fifth time in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal banged knees with Indiana's Derrick McKey just before halftime and lay 
sprawled on the court for three minutes. After X-rays showed no injury, O'Neal 
returned to the game early in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacers were not so fortunate. The team also lost its first-round draft 
pick, Scott Haskin, to a knee injury in the opening period. He did not return 
and will be examined in Indianapolis today. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 106, Washington 96 -- Mark Price scored 22 points and sparked a 
third-quarter run at Landover, Md., that sent the Cavaliers to their fourth 
consecutive victory.

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: THAT LAST LAP WOULDA TICKLED STERLIN'S MAMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a shame that Eula Faye wasn't there when her son Sterling Marlin won the 
Daytona 500 last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Eula Faye died in 1988, but she was there through 18 years of racing while her 
husband, Coo Coo, was trying without success to win a Winston Cup race, and she 
was there for most of the 14 seasons Sterling was trying, with equal lack of 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 Between father and son, they went to the post 444 times before Sterling won 
with the No. 4 Kodak Chevrolet owned by Tim Morgan and Larry McClure. 
</P>
<P>
 When Eula Faye talked, her accent was so backwoods-Tennessee syrupy that even 
Southerners found her hard to understand. By comparison with Eula Faye, 
Scarlett O'Hara spoke the Queen's English. 
</P>
<P>
 Eula Faye was violently opposed to Sterling becoming a race driver -- until 
she realized that he was the one to take over for his dad. The Marlin men, Coo 
Coo and Sterling, waited until the night before Sterling was planning to drive 
in his first race to tell her. 
</P>
<P>
 The story, perhaps apocryphal, has the family at the dinner table when Coo Coo 
says, innocently, "Pass the 'taters, Eula Faye, Sterlin's going racing." 
</P>
<P>
 Coo Coo was a teen-ager driving jalopies on a dirt track near his farm in 
Columbia, Tenn., when he first met Eula Faye Hughes. Four years later, they 
were married. There was never any thought of Marlin not continuing with his 
hobby of racing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just looked at it like going fishing," she said a few years ago. "It was 
something Coo Coo wanted to do, and I accepted that. It was different with 
Sterling. When I knew for sure he was going to drive, I wouldn't let myself 
think about it for a year, I'd get so upset. 
</P>
<P>
 "When time came for his first race at Nashville, I figured he would spin out 
or not make the field or do so poorly that I would be able to convince him to 
forget about racing." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sterling finished seventh, one position behind Darrell Waltrip, then the 
hot shoe of Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did soooo gooood," she drawled. "I knew right there I'd lost the battle." 
</P>
<P>
 Eula Faye made a deal -- if he would go to college for two years, she would 
accept his driving. He graduated from Columbia State Community College. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never quit worrying," she said, "but when he got married, I turned the 
fretting over to Paula (Sterling's wife)." 
</P>
<P>
 Sterling drove in his first Daytona 500 in 1980 as a substitute for his 
father, who became ill on race morning. He started 36th and finished eighth, 
and his payoff of $17,810 was more than his father had ever earned in one race. 
</P>
<P>
 Coo Coo was a character whose antics lived up to his nickname. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1974 Daytona 500, Coo Coo Marlin was running second, just ahead of 
Richard Petty on the track -- but nearly a lap behind -- when the checkered 
flag was given to Petty. Marlin, seeing the flag waving, believed it was for 
him and slowed down, waving to the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 When first Cale Yarborough and then Ramo Stott passed him, Marlin figured 
something was wrong and speeded up. It was too late. He finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I'd won the race," Marlin said, drinking a beer in the garage later 
that day. "I let up right after I get the checkered, and I wondered why those 
other guys went by me in the turn. Then I said to myself, 'Lawdy, Coo Coo, you 
done messed up.' " 
</P>
<P>
 When Sterling began racing, his name was listed as Sterlin -- without the g . 
Eula Faye explained: 
</P>
<P>
 "He was too lazy to spell the whole thing out. When he was a little kid he 
used to bring his test papers home from school, and up in the corner where they 
wrote their name, he would put Sterlin . I would scold him and tell him it was 
Sterling on his birth certificate." 
</P>
<P>
 Coo Coo, who was in Victory Circle on Sunday to help Sterling celebrate, won't 
get caught up in the spelling bee. He has his own stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lord, don't get me involved," he said. "I have trophies at home from my early 
days running at Nashville where they spelled Coo Coo 'Cuckoo'. " 
</P>
<P>
 Nashville is where it all started for both Marlins. Coo Coo was track champion 
there in 1959, '63, '65 and '66. Sterling took the 1980 championship. 
</P>
<P>
 When he came down to the final lap Sunday, knowing Ernie Irvan was hot on his 
bumper, Sterling Marlin said he kept his cool by telling himself it was "just 
like a short-track Saturday night in Nashville." 
</P>
<P>
 Eula Faye was probably smiling about that.

THOROUGHBRED RACING / BILL CHRISTINE; HUBBARD PLANS TO PURCHASE TURF PARADISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unsuccessful in acquiring two race tracks in Maryland last month, Hollywood 
Park had better luck in Arizona, as Chairman R.D. Hubbard announced Wednesday 
that the Inglewood track has signed a letter of intent to buy Turf Paradise in 
suburban Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking from Phoenix, Turf Paradise Chairman Robert Walker confirmed the 
deal, which will involve an exchange of stock worth $33 million to the Arizona 
track's 1,700 shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 When the transaction is completed next month, Hollywood Park will receive 2.6 
million shares in Turf Paradise and the Turf Paradise shareholders will get 1.4 
million newly issued shares in Hollywood Park. The Walker family is Turf 
Paradise's largest investor, owning 48% of the shares, and Walker said that 
under the terms of the deal, he will acquire 3.6% of the Hollywood Park stock, 
which will make him one of that track's largest investors. About one-third of 
the Hollywood Park stock is currently owned by Hubbard, Harry Ornest and John 
Brunetti. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Hubbard became chairman of Hollywood Park in 1991, he and the track have 
aggressively sought other gambling-related opportunities. Hubbard's strategy 
has been to pursue tracks in areas that might be receptive to casino gaming. 
Contrary to the opinions of some racing industry leaders, Hubbard believes that 
race betting and casino gambling are compatible. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbard's recent ventures include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Trying to buy the Pimlico and Laurel tracks in Maryland. This Hollywood 
Park deal collapsed at the 11th hour. Ownership there would have provided 
Hubbard with an opportunity to enter the newly created racing market in 
Virginia, where the owners of Pimlico and Laurel have applied for a license to 
build a track. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Building a card-playing club at Hollywood Park. The club's opening has been 
delayed because the state rejected a Hubbard appointee, Ed Allred, who would 
have run the casino under a lease arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Joining with Hollywood Park's shareholders in becoming a minority partner 
in a new track in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area. Hubbard and Hollywood Park dropped 
out, but Hubbard Enterprises, the Hollywood chairman's private company, landed 
a management contract for the Texas track. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Exploring an investment in a new track in suburban Seattle. Concluding that 
the track would not be financially sound, Hubbard withdrew. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Hollywood Park will go ahead with a plan to buy the Woodlands, 
which races horses and greyhounds in Kansas City, Kan. Since opening in 1990, 
the Woodlands, with Hubbard as a 60% investor, has accrued a debt of about $50 
million, but Hubbard believes that the tracks can capitalize on casino gambling 
if the state legalizes it. A recent state-wide poll, commissioned by the Kansas 
tracks, showed that 63% would vote in favor of casinos if the question were on 
a ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides a stake of about 18% in Hollywood Park, Hubbard also is a majority 
owner of Ruidoso Downs in New Mexico and owns the Multnomah Kennel Club, a 
greyhound track in Portland, Ore. There were unconfirmed reports Wednesday that 
Lonnie Powell, president of Multnomah, might be moving to Turf Paradise as 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding Hollywood Park's imminent purchase of Turf Paradise, Hubbard said: 
"This acquisition meets our strategy of national expansion through racing and 
other gambling opportunities that offer excellent value and significant upside 
potential. Turf Paradise is situated in a highly favorable demographic market 
and owns real estate (275 acres) with strong potential for other uses. We also 
believe that the legislative climate in Arizona may well offer the opportunity 
for other forms of gaming in the next two to three years." 
</P>
<P>
 Turf Paradise is a 38-year-old operation that has rid itself of a $2-million 
debt since Walker took over in 1988. Running a mix of mostly thoroughbreds with 
quarter horses and Arabians, Turf Paradise operated 177 days in 1992-93, from 
October through May, and showed earnings of $1.2 million, which accounted for 
its first stock dividend since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 The track, which draws on-track crowds that average 3,700, either runs or 
leases 35 off-track betting sites in Arizona and offers its races to 
out-of-state facilities at a lower commission than most tracks. Offering 13 
races on a recent Monday, when many tracks were closed, Turf Paradise generated 
a handle of $660,000 just through New York City's off-track betting network. 
</P>
<P>
 The horses the bettors see are mostly cheap, except when California trainers 
ship in for stakes races. Regardless of the quality, Turf Paradise horses run 
inordinately fast times, and the rock-hard racing strip has arguably been 
called the fastest in the world. Zany Tactics, a California invader, set a 
world record for six furlongs with a time of 1:06 4/5 in 1977, and Honor The 
Hero, a 6-year-old gelding who has been unsuccessful at larger tracks, matched 
the record while winning last year's $100,000 Phoenix Gold Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker, 60, had no racing background when he took over at Turf Paradise. 
"We've tried to run this track like I would any of the companies I've owned," 
he said. "Rather than follow what a lot of other tracks have done, we've 
listened to what our fans wanted, and tried to give it to them." 
</P>
<P>
 This has resulted in plenty of betting opportunities, including a bet known as 
the twin trifecta, and a semimonthly $1 breakfast buffet that gives fans the 
chance to meet trainers and jockeys. Turf Paradise might also be the only track 
in the country that doesn't have a daily program. Entries are drawn three days 
before races, a day earlier than other tracks, and this gives the Daily Racing 
Form, which moved its Los Angeles operation to Phoneix last year, the time to 
include all of the program information in its publication. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Wekiva Springs, one of California's most promising 3-year-olds, will miss the 
San Rafael Stakes at Santa Anita on March 6 because of a cracked hoof and the 
colt is also questionable for the San Felipe Stakes on March 20. "We're in a 
day-to-day situation with him," trainer Bob Hess Jr. said. "It's a small crack, 
near the back of the right front foot. The chances of patching it are slim and 
none, so we'll have to clean it out and have it grow back. This is an 
unfortunate injury because of the timing." The plan for Wekiva Springs had been 
to run in one of the prep races, followed by the Santa Anita Derby on April 9 
and the Kentucky Derby on May 7. Wekiva Springs has run four times and is on a 
three-race winning streak, including the Santa Catalina Stakes on Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Taliaferro, a successful trainer of both quarter horses and 
thoroughbreds, died Wednesday at his home near Oklahoma City, Okla. Taliaferro, 
60, learned that he had cancer of the throat last summer.

CULTURE WATCH; BATTERY ON ICE: PARODY IN PRINT

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You remember them: Portland's finest, the Olympic "Scheme Team." 
</P>
<P>
 There's Tonya Harding, who spent Wednesday earning unimpressive short-program 
scores in Lillehammer; Jolly Jeff Gillooly, last seen peddling topless video 
footage of his beloved ex-wife; and Shawn Eckardt (the bulging bodyguard) and 
Shane Stant -- both charged with conspiracy in the Jan. 6 attack on Nancy 
Kerrigan in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Now this lovable bunch is reunited on the pages of "WHACKED! -- The Adventures 
of Tonya Harding and Her Pals," a 32-page, full-color parody comic book to be 
published in March by The River Group of Westport, Conn. It will sell for 
$2.50, with the edition limited to "as many people who want to spend that much 
to buy it," according to Alan Katz, who has written the text for this morality 
play commemorative. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the "scoops" you'll find in "WHACKED!" is Tonya's Family Scrapbook, 
featuring pictures of baby Tonya, right up to her first cigar. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also an "Ask Tonya" feature, where the U.S. National Figure Skating 
champion offers "true glimpses" of her innermost feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz, who has also written for Disney's "Goof Troop" as well as a collection 
of trading cards, said "WHACKED!" avoids tramping into total tastelessness 
because "there's nothing here that you haven't seen or heard on 'A Current 
Affair' or the evening news." 
</P>
<P>
 He noted, too, that "WHACKED!" ends with a brief, but relatively sober 
discourse on winning and losing. ELIZABETH MEHREN

THE VISIONS OF JESUS DURING THE YEARS A.D. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ROURKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Who was Jesus? 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Schweitzer was among the first this century to ask that question in 
print, publishing "The Quest of the Historical Jesus" in 1906. Lately, others 
have explored the subject. Some make their claims with a scientist's caution. 
Others go for shock value. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Scholarly books for non-scholars: 
</P>
<P>
 * John Dominic Crossan's "Jesus: A Revolutionary Biography" 
(HarperSanFrancisco) casts him as a political agitator who never claimed to be 
divine. A New Testament professor at DePaul University in Chicago and 
co-chairman of the Jesus Seminar, Crossan holds that the Gospels' best-known 
stories about Jesus' life are myths. Still, he concludes that his theories do 
not contradict the fundamentals of the Christian faith. 
</P>
<P>
 * Burton Mack's "The Lost Gospel" (HarperSanFrancisco) presents "The Book of 
Q" (Q for Quelle, or "source" in German). He and other scholars believe it once 
existed, is now lost and was made up of quotes from Jesus which the New 
Testament Gospel writers inserted into their own books. Mack is on the faculty 
of the School of Theology at Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
 * John P. Meier's "A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus" 
(Doubleday) aims to distinguish Jesus the man from what later teachings made 
him out to be. It shows him as one of at least seven children who probably 
married, but remained celibate for religious reasons. A New Testament professor 
at Catholic University in Washington, Meier holds that his proposals do not 
conflict with the fundamentals of Christian faith. 
</P>
<P>
 * A.N. Wilson's "Jesus" (Norton) reads like a popular biography, with 
footnotes. A British journalist, Wilson examines several theories that are 
explored in more scholarly detail by Crossan and Meier. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A crossover case, where showmanship all but outdoes scholarship: 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Five Gospels," by Robert W. Funk, Roy W. Hoover and The Jesus Seminar 
(Macmillan), is arguably the most controversial new book about Jesus. The 
combined work of Bible scholars across the country, it concludes that Jesus 
said just 18% of what has been attributed to him for centuries. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Books by scholars that emulate the genre of fictionalized biography: 
</P>
<P>
 * John Shelby Spong's "Born of a Woman?" (HarperSanFrancisco) is his 14th book 
on New Testament topics. An Episcopal bishop and Jesus Seminar member, he 
proposes here that Jesus' mother, Mary, was not a virgin, and that the marriage 
feast at Cana, a well-known Gospel story, is about Jesus' own wedding. This 
book follows Spong's "Rescuing the Bible From Fundamentalism" 
(HarperSanFrancisco), in which he asserts that Paul the Apostle was a 
homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
 * Barbara Thiering's "Jesus and the Riddle of the Dead Sea Scrolls" 
(HarperSanFrancisco) presents an entirely different picture. Among her 
proposals: Jesus came from Qumran, home of the now famous scrolls; he was 
married twice and had three children, and he did not die on the cross but was 
drugged and later revived. Thiering is on the religion faculty of Sydney 
University, in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the first books to relate the new image of Jesus to contemporary faith: 
</P>
<P>
 * Marcus J. Borg's "Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time" blends 
biographical details with early church history, to show how and why the facts 
were embellished. Borg's "Jesus, A New Vision" (HarperSanFrancisco) is a 
biography. He is a professor of religion at Oregon State University and a Jesus 
Seminar member. MARY ROURKE

CBS ON WAY TO OLYMPICS RATINGS GOLD; TELEVISION: THE WINTER GAMES ARE PROVING 
TO BE A WINNER AS THE NETWORK HEADS FOR THE HIGHEST RATINGS FOR ANY OLYMPICS. 
THE HARDING-KERRIGAN DRAMA IS ONLY PART OF THE APPEAL. 
</P>

<P>
 Even before the final chapter in "Skategate," the Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan 
soap opera, the 1994 Winter Olympics have brought ratings gold to CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Record numbers of viewers have been tuning in to the Winter Games from 
Lillehammer, Norway, and CBS is on its way to achieving the highest ratings for 
any Olympics, network executives said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the first week of the Olympics, CBS had its highest rating ever in the 
history of the network," said David Poltrack, vice president in charge of 
audience research. "We are currently pacing at a level that will give us an 
Olympics ratings record, whether for Summer or Winter Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
 Through the first 10 days of the Winter Games, the network has averaged nearly 
a 26 rating in prime time (which translates to more than 24 million homes). The 
previous record for that period was ABC's 23.6 rating for the 1980 Olympics at 
Lake Placid, which featured the surprise win by the U.S. hockey team. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS said that, at mid-point, some 170 million viewers had tuned in to watch at 
least some of its extensive Winter Olympics coverage, with the much-anticipated 
competition between Harding and Kerrigan still to come. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As for why people have been watching in such great numbers, CBS executives 
could only guess. They acknowledged that the massive international publicity 
surrounding Harding and Kerrigan aided them in the ratings, but they noted that 
people wouldn't be watching this much if that was the only thing that 
interested them -- especially since the women's figure skating didn't get under 
way until Wednesday night and was to continue Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were obviously given a great tune-in audience by the Harding-Kerrigan 
controversy, but the fact that we've held that audience night after night means 
that people are satisfied with what they're seeing," said George Schweitzer, 
vice president in charge of marketing for CBS. "We emphasized that the Olympics 
are about human stories, and we talked about Dan Jansen, Bonnie Blair" and 
other U.S. athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS designed its prime-time broadcasts by studying the coverage from the 
Albertville Olympics in 1992, analyzing which events were most popular with 
viewers. Figure skating, for example, is very popular with women, and so there 
has been skating nearly every night. And the demographics for the 1994 Olympics 
are running about 60% female, CBS executives said. 
</P>
<P>
 Television ratings for the Olympics also are running high in other countries, 
according to the U.S. Olympic Committee, which may lend credence to the "global 
water cooler" theory that, with fewer major attractions to bind them, people in 
the United States and around the globe are enjoying being part of an 
international event that they know the whole world is watching. 
</P>
<P>
 The record ratings for CBS are not directly paying off financially, however, 
because the network had sold commercial time this year based on an 18.6 rating. 
So it's the advertisers who are benefiting by getting the additional viewership 
at no additional cost.  
</P>
<P>
 But CBS was able to sell a few 30-second spots that had been held back in case 
it got a lower rating than had been promised and had to make up the difference 
to an advertiser. The cost for one of those spots in women's figure skating? 
About $430,000 -- compared to the average $325,000 paid by sponsors who paid in 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
 The bigger payoff for CBS will come when it begins to sell commercials for the 
1998 Winter Olympics, because those prices will be based on the ratings 
garnered this time out. 
</P>
<P>
 Some viewers and TV critics have criticized CBS for excessively 
"cross-promoting" the Olympics on various programs, but the strategy apparently 
has worked, not only in terms of the Olympics ratings but in ratings for the 
other shows. "CBS This Morning" is expected to beat "Today" and "Good Morning 
America" for the first time ever in the ratings this week, the "CBS Evening 
News" jumped from its usual third position to a strong second last week, and 
David Letterman's ratings last week were the highest since the week his show 
premiered.

LOOK WHO'S ON THE OUTSIDE AT MOVIE EXPO -- L.A.!; MOVIES: AFTER FAILING TO 
OBTAIN A BOOTH AT A KEY GATHERING OF FILM COMMISSIONERS, THE CITY WILL ERECT A 
HUGE TENT IN FRONT OF THE COURTHOUSE IN SANTA MONICA TO WOO PRODUCERS AND 
LUCRATIVE PROJECTS. 
</P>

<P>
 Claiming that location shooting drains more than $1 billion a year from the 
local economy, the city of Los Angeles plans to erect a tent on the front lawn 
of the county courthouse in Santa Monica on Friday to woo Hollywood producers 
attending a movie and TV location trade show this weekend at the nearby Santa 
Monica Civic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles officials are upset that they were unable to secure a coveted 
booth inside the auditorium for Location Expo '94, which is sponsored by the 
Assn. of Film Commissioners International. Film commissioners from all 50 
states and many foreign countries will be out in force at the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't invited inside (the auditorium)," said Cody Cluff, assistant 
deputy mayor for entertainment industry affairs. "They would deny it, but this 
is a show designed to come into Los Angeles and take away our jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Leigh von der Esch, president of the AFCI, denied there was any attempt to 
keep Los Angeles out of the trade show, and said the city simply failed to 
respond to repeated requests to reserve space at the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only at the last minute, when all available space allotted to us had been 
assigned, did the (Los Angeles Film) commission finally request a booth," Von 
der Esch said in a prepared statement. "We would have been happy to accommodate 
the commission, if only they had responded to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Location Expo '94 is the world's largest for film locations and services, 
attracting 168 domestic and foreign film commissions and 29 affiliates, some 
from as far off as the Netherlands, South Africa and the Cayman Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Cluff said Los Angeles did not apply promptly for a booth because the city's 
former film czar, Beth Kennedy, had left office several months before and he 
had not yet taken office. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're telling me that when 60% of the filming in the nation is done here in 
Los Angeles and 80% of the filming in California is done here, that because of 
a technicality, you're going to bar us?" Cluff said. "It looks to me like this 
is a show designed to take business out of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 So, armed with a 30-by-30-foot tent, a portable billboard, big balloons, 
popcorn and refreshments, the city will set up shop on the courthouse lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 His sales pitch to Hollywood: "Los Angeles understands the entertainment 
industry. We have a new mayor and a new attitude toward business. We will 
provide all the assistance we can that producers are looking for." 
</P>
<P>
 Cluff admits that Los Angeles County -- which last year saw 325 films shot out 
of about 600 nationwide -- is facing stiff competition from other locales. 
</P>
<P>
 Some states offer free helicopters, cars and cellular phones as incentives to 
film in their areas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But commissioners in other states say that they are not out to strip Los 
Angeles of its $4-billion industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's raping and pillaging," said Suzy Kellett, director of the 
Illinois Film Office. Illinois reaped a record $115 million last year providing 
location shooting of such films as the Oscar-nominated film "The Fugitive," and 
two television series, "Missing Persons" and "The Untouchables." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not going after every piece of filming in Los Angeles," Kellett said. 
"We are only going after those projects that are going out (of L.A.) anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the films made in Illinois recently were portions of "My Life," "Rudy" 
and two films that have not yet been released: Oliver Stone's "Natural Born 
Killers" and John Hughes' "Baby's Day Out," which shot 27 weeks in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 Some governors have made the pilgrimage to Hollywood to help lure filmmakers 
to their states. Massachusetts Gov. William F. Weld, for instance, made a trade 
mission here last March and got a commitment from Columbia Pictures after 
meeting with them. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last 15 months, Massachusetts has had all major studios shooting motion 
pictures there, including "The Good Son" with Macaulay Culkin, "Malice" with 
Nicole Kidman and Alec Baldwin, portions of "Hocus Pocus" with Bette Midler, 
and snippets of "The Firm" and "The River Wild." In 1992 alone, Massachusetts 
reaped $210 million in direct revenues from Hollywood filmmaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Peterson Warren, director of the Massachusetts Film Office, said her 
state has instigated a number of measures to ease the process of making movies 
there. They include giving production companies a "blue pass" to park curbside 
at Logan International Airport when dropping off film and use of a proposed 
special traffic lane to whisk them past gridlock from the airport to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 She said her office last year worked to help producers of the Tommy Lee 
Jones/Jeff Bridges action film "Blown Away" to carry off dramatic special 
effects in Boston with a minimum of problems, including blowing up a ship in 
East Boston Harbor and detonating a police car in the historic section of the 
city called Copley Square, which features Trinity Church dating back to the 
1700s. 
</P>
<P>
 In Boston Harbor, she said, the film office helped get city and state 
officials on board so that producers could detonate a ship. "Windows were 
broken and people were evacuated at no expense to them (before the special 
effects took place)," Warren said. "They were given dinner and free earplugs."

HAPPY WRITING ABOUT NOTHING; CAROL LEIFER FLED THE GRIND OF STAND-UP TO WORK 
FOR 'SEINFELD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID KRONKE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Carol Leifer started working for the "Seinfeld" series at the beginning 
of this season, she was a "Program Consultant." Now, she's been promoted to 
"Story Editor." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't tell the folks signing her checks, but the fact is, she's a writer. As 
Jerry Seinfeld himself might quickly interject, not that there's anything wrong 
with that. 
</P>
<P>
 Leifer, 37, came to writing for NBC's most popular sitcom after fleeing the 
world of stand-up comedy, where she had spent most of her adult life. Simply 
put, she tired of the endless tours of small-town Chuckle Huts, where the 
owners were more interested in pushing alcohol than comedy. A mere two weeks 
after she had privately made her decision to ditch the road, her old friends 
Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David called. Also veterans of the club circuit, they 
had more recently become very wealthy and very powerful picking through the 
minutiae of everyday life and calling it a TV series. They offered her a gig 
program-consulting, story-editing or whatever. She became the first -- and only 
-- female staff writer for the series celebrated for being about nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I feel about stand-up now, it's like the fall of Saigon," Leifer 
says. "People are hanging on to the chopper, you know, trying to get out. I had 
really lost interest -- I had been doing it a long time, and to really live in 
my apartment now is great." 
</P>
<P>
 Leifer, a New York native transplanted to L.A. two years ago, will still play 
the odd club date in town. Some of her material ("Playgirl magazine is not 
necessary -- all a woman needs to do to see a naked guy is ask him; what I'd 
like to see is a picture of a normal guy calling me back") would seem natural 
for Elaine, "Seinfeld's" female comic foil. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Seinfeld has told interviewers that Leifer was the model for Elaine. 
Leifer is a tad uncomfortable with the compliment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes away what Julia-Louis Dreyfus has brought to the role," says Leifer. 
"I tell people I'm the basis for Kramer." 
</P>
<P>
 Seinfeld, for his part, says this about Leifer: "I, for one, would not like to 
imagine living in a world without Carol Leifer." 
</P>
<P>
 Before "Seinfeld," Leifer wrote briefly for Tom Arnold's defunct "The Jackie 
Thomas Show." "It's completely different to work on a show that was struggling 
to come into its own with one that's a Top 10 show," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, "Seinfeld's" 11 writers (including Seinfeld) have a certain 
freedom that other series simply don't enjoy -- episodes have dealt with 
masturbation and outing. There are few language restrictions; an upcoming 
episode involves Elaine's blind date exposing himself, or, as the script puts 
it, "Little Frank taking some air." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's become so successful that the rules for this show are different than the 
rules for other shows," Leifer admits. "I think (the network) really bends over 
backward to accommodate Larry David with what he wants -- everything's been 
going so well." 
</P>
<P>
 On one hand, the show's success takes off a certain amount of stress; on the 
other, Leifer says it has made Seinfeld and executive producer David perhaps 
more demanding in order to keep the program's quality up.  
</P>
<P>
 "Larry and Jerry are so attuned now that -- it's become such a well-oiled 
machine that you can pitch an idea to them and they know right away whether 
it's gonna be an episode or not," she says. "I came in my first day, and one of 
my ideas was George hires a deaf woman to read the lips of his ex-girlfriend at 
a party, and they both said, 'That will be a show.'  
</P>
<P>
 "Another idea I pitched was that -- you know how the Guardian Angels will ask 
for money? -- I thought it would be a good George idea if he went to a Guardian 
Angel and said, 'I gave you a donation, but I believe I gave you a $20 instead 
of a $1, and could I please have it back,' and as he's leaving the place, he 
gets mugged and nobody helps him. Larry said they had just done something like 
that. That can be frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
 "The challenge of working here is coming up with things that are small and 
quirky, because a lot of times you'll pitch an idea, and the thing they say a 
lot is, 'I could see that on another show.' And they won't do it. It's really 
telling that that's the way your idea gets turned down -- 'I could see that on 
another show.' Larry's always striving for something different, and that's a 
unique environment in Hollywood sitcom writing." 
</P>
<P>
 Leifer's office is sparsely appointed; she doesn't even have a computer (in 
fact, for such a contemporary show, all of "Seinfeld's" writers except one pen 
their scripts the old-fashioned way, in longhand). Writers tend to work alone 
("It's like independent study," she laughs). On a bulletin board Leifer's "idea 
cards" are pinned up -- those which David did approve of -- each containing one 
potential subplot for an episode, which generally boasts three or four 
interweaving stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, Leifer has turned autobiographical incidents into story ideas. 
"I went to see Bette Midler in December at the (Universal) Amphitheatre," she 
says, "and the line for the ladies' room, like most places you go, was 
incredibly long and it was so frustrating that a few women got together and 
said, 'Let's go to the men's room,' and since there were a few of us, it was OK 
and we went. But it's created this monster in me now that if I go someplace and 
there's the remotest bit of a line to the ladies' room, I will go alone into 
the men's room. And we were talking about this at work, and Larry said, 'that's 
a great Elaine story'. . . . The good thing about this job is I do a lot of 
things now that I normally wouldn't do because you can usually get a story out 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The next, admittedly tricky, task is to find the right mix of subplots for 
each episode. "The lip reader episode -- from thinking of it, to it being shot, 
was a couple of months," she says. "But the one I've been working on now 
(Elaine acts as a beard for a gay man at a professional function), has been 
three months" -- she shrugs -- "because there have been so many incarnations of 
it. I'll write a draft, and they'll say, 'You need something better for the 
Jerry story,' and I'll have to go back and do it again. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some writers, a month is really quick, and others will linger around all 
season until you get it exactly right. But I like that about working on this 
show, because when these guys say it isn't exactly there, I believe them, 
because they know what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 And Leifer's longstanding relationship with Seinfeld and David remains intact. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really happy they asked me to work here, but I was -- when you work for 
a friend, it changes the dynamic," she says. "I've seen it work out well and so 
far here, knock wood, it's worked out great, but I've seen people work for each 
other and it destroys the friendship. And I always thought that if it happens 
with this job, then it wasn't worth taking the job." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what the title.

Q&A WITH JOHNETTE NAPOLITANO; 'WE'VE DONE WHAT WE SET OUT TO DO' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Johnette Napolitano, one of the most fiery and colorful figures on L.A.'s rock 
scene for a decade, is closing the book on Concrete Blonde. The trio plays the 
Wiltern Theatre on Saturday, then returns there March 10 for a farewell show .  
</P>
<P>
 The band's often turbulent music succeeded X's as the rock chronicle of Los 
Angeles' state of mind. Now singer-bassist Napolitano is looking forward to 
making a "less intense" kind of music with such pals as Paul Westerberg, Steve 
Wynn and members of Wall of Voodoo. Napolitano, who is deeply involved in the 
life of her Silver Lake neighborhood, is also eager to make a go of her new 
enterprise, the Lucky Nun gallery, which showcases young Latino artists and 
stages a monthly open market in the parking lot.  
</P>
<P>
 Napolitano explained her decision to cut the cord and talked about her future 
in a phone interview from a tour stop in Atlanta.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Why end the band now? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Because it's done. I don't know how else to say it. We've done what we 
set out to do. It's been such a long time and I want to see who I am. There's 
other things I want to do. I might want to start a family of my own. I'm 36 
years old. When do I get to do that? And you keep putting these things aside. 
And then you have earthquakes and things and you just think, well, you know, I 
have my life to do. 
</P>
<P>
 The life just doesn't agree with me anymore. The whole rock thing I just would 
like to ditch for a while. It can get out of control and your life isn't your 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will you be decreasing your involvement in music? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't think so. I think that remains to be seen. I'd like to work with 
some younger bands to get them off and started, with such not white, 
middle-class rock stuff. That's sort of boring me at this point. The Beavis and 
Butt-head factor is a little too much. When these kids start slammin' around I 
could be anybody up there. I'd like to broaden myself a little bit. 
</P>
<P>
 But I'll always play music. It's something that I do. I write like a fiend all 
the time for no particular reason. That'll continue, but I would like to see 
myself having more of a dignity as I get older. Like a Billie Holiday or a 
Bessie Smith, a great blueswoman rather than a kid throwin' a bass around and 
slammin' my head around. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not what I am anymore. I'm pretty content with life in general. I'm 
much more involved with art. I've got the gallery and I'm very happy being 
inspired and surrounded by artists. I'm back to what I like to do. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've had your finger on the pulse of this city for a long time. After all 
the recent crises, are you disillusioned about life in L.A.? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm not disillusioned about anything. But when you have something like a 
quake, you do wonder if you're being punished for something. You have riots, 
you have the quake, you have other things. I think it's important to try to go 
on. Balance things out and neutralize the effect somehow by being as normal as 
you can be. I think people have some real backbone in L.A. The human spirit is 
very strong. It's always my home, absolutely. 
</P>
<P>
 But as far as being able to live where I live now, it's getting very 
difficult. People can drive by and see me in my living room and stuff. I caught 
'em using my mailbox as a drug drop and I just went off. So I think I might 
have a little bit of a price on my head in the neighborhood right now for 
calling the cops so much when I see that stuff go on. So I just might have to 
move over a little bit and rent my house out. It'll break my heart because I 
really love that place. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about the musical side of the city? What do you think of the current 
L.A. rock scene? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think Guns N' Roses changed everything. It really took the diversity 
away. You had Phranc, you had Los Lobos, the Go-Go's, the Cramps, you had a 
real diverse scene. There was so much goin' on. . . . I'd like to see more 
Chicano bands. I'm serious about that. I think some Chicano band is really 
gonna break through. It'll be different in that Los Lobos had a traditional 
angle, and I think the younger Chicanos have more of a statement to make. I 
think they've been inspired by Los Lobos and Los Illegals and a lot of the 
early L.A. stuff. I think that what's good about L.A. right now is there's more 
of that going on. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've been described as a "conscience" of the L.A. rock community. Do you 
feel comfortable with that kind of role? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm a musician and I play and I write music. I don't claim to be anybody's 
role model. I like to drink. I have a lot of fun with a bottle of wine and I 
don't really feel like I have to set an example for anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 I think just the fact that I do what I wanted to do in my life, if that's 
inspiring to anybody, that's great. I had a real crisis a while ago when the 
"Bloodletting" album came out, wondering if I was doing something worthwhile 
with my life or not, and at the end of the day I get mail and people tell me 
they come home from a hard day's work and they put on the record and I take 'em 
somewhere else and it gets them through things. 
</P>

<P>
 Q: Do you remember any specific comments? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Some 12-year-old kid wrote me that she listened to my music when her 
parents started fighting. And I called her up, I called her on the phone and 
told her to keep writing her poetry and everything. It was a real sad letter. I 
said, honey, I did exactly what you're doing. I started playing guitar when my 
parents started fighting, and it really was a good place to go and it's still a 
good place to go. Music is a good place to go when you're not feeling on top of 
things or you feel lonely or whatever. Yeah, I think what I do is very valid. 
If it gets people through bad times and makes you feel better, then damn right. 
It's an honor to be able to do that for people. It's a gift and I appreciate 
it.

A BEATING, RACISM, JUSTICE DENIED -- IN 1880; TELEVISION: HOLLYWOOD SNUBBED A 
LITTLE-KNOWN CHAPTER IN U.S. HISTORY UNTIL L.A.'S 1992 RIOTS. ON SUNDAY, 
SHOWTIME WILL AIR 'ASSAULT AT WEST POINT.' 
</P>

<P>
 It took the Rodney G. King case and the Los Angeles riots of the 1990s to get 
a movie made about the Johnson Whittaker case of the 1880s and its tangled 
roots of racism. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie, "Assault at West Point," written, directed and produced by Harry 
Moses for Showtime, debuts Sunday as part of the cable network's programming 
for Black History Month. 
</P>
<P>
 The 21-year-old Whittaker, one of the first blacks at West Point, was found 
beaten and tied to his bed April 6, 1880, a few months shy of his graduation. 
In an apparent cover-up, the cadet was charged with staging his own assault to 
avoid a pending philosophy examination. In turn, to test the charges, he 
demanded a court-martial rather than expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 The media and national attention to the trial and its verdict, according to 
documents of the period, share many similarities with the events in Los Angeles 
some 110 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing in his career quite prepared producer Moses for the trials he 
faced to get his movie made. 
</P>
<P>
 Moses is no outsider to the way television works, having been with CBS News 
and "60 Minutes" for 14 years, heading up investigative news units and 
producing projects. He and his wife, Judith, a former "20/20" staff member, 
have their own television production company, the Mosaic Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 He found out that the true story of an obscure 19th-Century Army cadet was not 
exactly high-concept, green-light, fast-track development marquee material. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking for a follow-up courtroom drama in 1988 after directing and producing 
an "American Playhouse" production about Bernhard Goetz, the so-called New York 
subway vigilante, Moses came across the story of Whittaker in a high school 
text about American trials, which led him to an earlier book on the Whittaker 
case by historian John Marzsalek. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nature of drama is conflict and the nature of the courtroom is conflict," 
Moses says. Whittaker's case had conflict inscribed all over it. 
</P>
<P>
 Moses went to the National Archives in Washington and started reading through 
the original 12,000 handwritten transcript pages of the court-martial. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the most racist document I have seen," Moses says, referring to racial 
stereotypes and personal characterizations made by the prosecution and others 
during the trial. "But you have to understand the past if you want to mend the 
present. I never understood the nature of racism in this country until I 
researched that transcript. I never saw it articulated before so publicly." 
</P>
<P>
 He wrote a movie outline, took it to executives at most of the broadcast and 
cable networks and was unanimously turned down. He took it to Paramount, having 
heard that Eddie Murphy was looking for a serious feature movie. "I was laughed 
out of the office," Moses says. 
</P>
<P>
 He offered the outline to an agent at CAA. "The agent liked the story," Moses 
says, "but said the trouble with the project is that it's about something and 
television is about nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Moses put the project aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Los Angeles, another April, this time 1992 . . . Rodney King . . . 
another courtroom drama . . . a verdict . . . an aftermath. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moses had a luncheon date scheduled on the first day of the riots with Steven 
Hewitt, senior vice president of Showtime Entertainment. Hewitt was interested 
in a different project, a documentary on King. That morning Moses sent fax 
copies to Hewitt of his West Point outline plus some historic parallels he saw 
between the Whittaker case and King. 
</P>
<P>
 Before they could order lunch, Hewitt told Moses, "We're making your movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the eventual go-ahead, Moses says his five-year effort to get the 
movie made shows "how wretched television can be and how difficult it is to get 
a story of this nature on the air. It is a serious subject. One should not have 
had to struggle this hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Moses landed Samuel L. Jackson ("Amos and Andrew") and Sam Waterston ("I'll 
Fly Away") for the movie's key roles. The accused cadet, played by newcomer 
Seth Gilliam, was represented at the trial by two lawyers: white abolitionist 
Daniel Chamberlain and Richard Greener, the first black graduate of Harvard Law 
and the first dean of the Howard University law school. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two were not exactly a team. Something changed between them during the 
trial. What actually happened between the white 19th-Century liberal lawyer and 
the black activist lawyer in the defense of their client remains a mystery. 
There are no documented clues about how the five-month court-martial altered 
them and their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 The white lawyer, Chamberlain, had led efforts to integrate public schools, 
had once commanded a black Civil War Army unit, but expressed racist views, 
endorsed lynching, then later said that he regretted becoming an abolitionist. 
</P>
<P>
 The black lawyer, Greener, took an active role in the defense early in the 
trial but "disappears" half way through the case, Moses says, the transcripts 
reporting little from him other than his apparent dislike of how the case was 
being tried. 
</P>
<P>
 And cadet Whittaker? 
</P>
<P>
 He was found guilty of all charges against him and was denied a commission for 
not taking a philosophy examination. He was sentenced to one year of hard 
labor, a sentence never carried out because Whittaker appealed to President 
Chester Arthur, who pardoned him. He served no prison time. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittaker went back to his native South Carolina, took up law and became a 
high school principal. He moved to Oklahoma City and was the first black to 
move into a white neighborhood there. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty years after his court-martial, he found himself defending his family and 
his new home as a cross burned on his front lawn.

 There was the Winter Olympics, and then there was everything else. That's how 
last week's prime-time TV ratings broke down in the figures released Wednesday 
by the A.C. Nielsen Co. "60 Minutes" tied for seventh place with Day 3 of CBS' 
snow-and-ice games, but ABC's "Home Improvement," which followed at No. 9, was 
three points behind--meaning it reached 2.8 million fewer homes than the 
lowest-rated Olympics broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS said it was the network's highest-rated week in history, and the largest 
audiences ever for Olympics programming--summer or winter. On average, the 
network's prime-time schedule attracted 40% of the available audience last 
week--a whopping 24.4 million homes, compared to9.8 million for ABC, 8.5 
million for NBC and 6.9 million for Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC had been making a run at CBS in recent weeks, but CBS is now assured of 
winning the prime-time season for the third year in a row.

 Here are the ratings for national prime-time television last week (Feb. 14-22) 
as compiled by the A. C. Nielsen Co. Each rating point is said by Nielsen to 
represent 942,000 homes, or 1% of the 94.2 million U.S. households that have 
TV. Southland Ratings

EXPERTS FIND FLAWS BUT SAY TUNNELS SAFE; ENGINEERING: THIN CONCRETE, AIR 
POCKETS AND MISSING REINFORCING STEEL ARE FOUND IN SUBWAYS. MTA WANTS 
CONTRACTOR TO REPAIR OR PAY FOR DEFECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Specialists hired to examine the Los Angeles subway reported Wednesday that 
they found lax enforcement of construction requirements, along with previously 
undiscovered areas of thin concrete, air pockets and missing reinforcing steel 
in the tunnel walls. 
</P>
<P>
 But the engineers who assessed the structures said the tunnels are safe and 
will remain so if the air pockets are filled and leaks of corrosive water are 
sealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin E. White, chief executive officer of the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority, said he will seek to have the contractor whose work was found most 
defective, Tutor-Saliba Corp., perform or pay for the repairs.  
</P>
<P>
 White and MTA Chairman Richard Alatorre said they also will try to force 
Parsons-Dillingham, the management firm paid in excess of $170 million to 
oversee subway construction, to share repair costs. 
</P>
<P>
 White said he does not know what the repairs will cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some shortcomings in the construction," White said. "There were 
also some shortcomings in the supervision of that construction (by 
Parsons-Dillingham). But again, the key point is that the tunnel, despite those 
conditions, (is) safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald N. Tutor, president of Tutor-Saliba, said that although he believes his 
company has been unfairly singled out for scrutiny, he would make the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect to look at the report, and wherever these areas of (air voids) 
occur, we'll fix them," Tutor said, adding that deficiencies would be found in 
any structure scrutinized like the 1.8 miles of twin tunnels built by his firm 
between Union Station and Pershing Square. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing a need to review the findings in more detail, the MTA board of 
directors postponed a vote on final approval of a new $45-million construction 
contract for which Tutor-Saliba is the low bidder. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Parsons-Dillingham spokeswoman said the firm will try to cooperate with the 
MTA but has not yet agreed to pay for repairs. "We're willing to sit down with 
them and figure out what we can do," Debra Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another representative of Parsons, Ray W. Judson, said in a statement that the 
firm has "put into place an entire new management team" that is doing a better 
job on the construction of new segments of the Red Line subway. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports unveiled Wednesday were prepared by two separate groups hired in 
September in response to an article in The Times reporting that numerous 
sections of the concrete subway tunnels were built thinner than the 
design-specified thickness of 12 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 One group of two engineers and a former tunnel company executive examined the 
physical soundness of the tunnels and produced a 45-page report. The second 
group, a New Jersey-based law firm that specializes in engineering matters, 
examined the performance of Parsons-Dillingham in overseeing construction and 
managing costs of the $1.45-billion subway, including the handling of contract 
amendments called change orders. The firm found that the shortcomings of 
Parsons-Dillingham were extensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Concrete was placed in some instances without inspector approval," the 
engineering law firm, Barba Arkon International Inc., said in a 49-page report. 
"(We) also identified significant deviations from (Parsons-Dillingham's) 
written procedures relative to stop work notices, change order analysis, 
project scheduling requirements and quality assurance/quality control 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 "These deviations from written procedures are at variance with what is 
considered acceptable industry practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Evans M. Barba, chairman of the law firm, said his investigation found that 
the worst problems occurred in Parsons-Dillingham's management of the 
construction between Union Station and Pershing Square. Barba, whose firm was 
paid $150,000, identified seven categories of "substantial deviations" from 
contract specifications. 
</P>
<P>
 The law firm was generally more pointed in its conclusions than was the 
separate panel of three experts hired to review the soundness of the tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel and its team of consultants, who were paid a total of $1.25 million, 
identified at least 350 linear feet of previously undiscovered thin concrete 
and air voids in the crown areas of the tunnels between Union Station and 
Pershing Square. The panel recommended that the voids, located between the 
concrete and a plastic membrane designed to keep the tunnel dry and gas-free, 
be filled with injections of grout. The voids, ranging in width to six feet and 
in length to 20 feet, are serving as conduits for water that has been leaking 
into the tops of the tunnels, the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
 After conducting tests, the panel concluded that the new areas of concrete 
thinness -- along with areas of missing reinforcing steel -- are of no 
structural significance. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract specifications called for 12 inches of concrete, and officials 
have required contractors to place extra rods of reinforcing steel in areas 
where thickness dips below 10 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 The tunnel panel found that Tutor-Saliba had not placed extra reinforcing 
steel in the areas of newly discovered thin concrete. The experts also 
determined that workers had severed the rods of steel at certain construction 
joints, contrary to design plans that called for continuous steel reinforcing. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the panel members said tunnel walls that are at least six inches -- 
with no rods of reinforcing steel -- are adequate. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel was made up of Edward J. Cording, an engineering professor at the 
University of Illinois; John M. Hanson, a retired executive and professor of 
engineering at North Carolina State University, and Paul De Marco, a retired 
tunnel company executive from New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Hanson and Cording said they were unconcerned about missing 
reinforcing steel because they concluded that the steel served no role in 
providing structural strength. 
</P>
<P>
 That conclusion drew immediate reaction.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm flabbergasted," said Michael L. Shank, whose Colorado-based company built 
the subway tunnels between Pershing Square and MacArthur Park. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his firm was required in all instances to place extra steel in any 
area of thin concrete. "We were just saps," Shank added. "All I can say is, 
they held us to a different standard." 
</P>
<P>
 John F. Hall, a professor at Caltech who specializes in earthquake 
engineering, said he, too, was surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't just put steel in tunnels to make ourselves feel good," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that the panel's report acknowledged that the reinforcing steel was 
required at the time of construction, partly "to provide bending capacity for 
ground loads." 
</P>
<P>
 James Pott, an engineer and former board member of the MTA's rail construction 
subsidiary, said the tunnel panel's conclusion that the structures would be 
adequate with six inches of concrete, with no steel rebar, is a "complete 
override of everything that's been designed. Why bother with these construction 
requirements?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to calling for repair of air voids and water leaks, the panel said 
that: 
</P>
<P>
 * Because "grouting records are not available," the MTA should determine the 
extent of other voids between the plastic membrane and the surrounding earth 
and fill them. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Northridge earthquake widened some tunnel cracks, and transit officials 
should consider repairs to "prevent further separation of cracks" that would 
allow pieces of concrete to crumble onto the tracks from the entrances to 
utility rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some water leaking into the tunnel is highly corrosive, and it should be 
monitored "with the aim of detecting changes in conditions at an early stage 
and grouting or making (other) repairs." 
</P>
<P>
 * MTA officials should examine a defective concrete wall along tracks outside 
the Civic Center station to "determine whether additional work needs to be 
done." 
</P>
<P>
 Board members of the MTA were divided Wednesday in their responses to the 
reports. The findings allayed the fears of some, but heightened the concerns of 
others. Some officials said the reports proved that the MTA must exercise far 
more diligent oversight of its multibillion-dollar projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you pay for a system you pay for it to be delivered in operating, Class 
A condition -- not with deficiencies," said county Supervisor Mike Antonovich. 
"It's the equivalent of buying a new car and finding (that) the engine, the 
tires and the transmission go out when you drive it off the showroom floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Councilman Evan Anderson Braude said: "It confirms my feeling that 
the tunnel is safe." Subway Tunnel Inspection 
</P>
<P>
 A panel of experts concluded Tuesday that some tunnel walls in the Los Angeles 
subway were built thinner than designed but are structually sound. The panel 
also found the Red Line subway was built with some voids between the concrete 
tunnel liner an a plastic membrane that surrounds the tunnel. The gaps are up 
to six feet wide, 20 feet long, and 3 3/4 inches deep. The experts recommend 
repair of 18 gaps between Pershing Square and Union Station.

MTA APPROVES PLAN TO LINK SUBWAY, UNIVERSAL; RED LINE: MCA HAD SOUGHT A STATION 
CLOSER TO THE STUDIO THEME PARK. THE COMPROMISE, WHICH AVOIDS COSTLY DELAYS, 
PROPOSES A PEOPLE-MOVER SYSTEM CONNECTING WITH THE LANKERSHIM BOULEVARD STOP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ending months of haggling with entertainment giant MCA, the county 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority on Wednesday approved an agreement to 
link a planned subway stop with MCA's sprawling Universal Studios complex 
through a people-mover system. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal brings to a close an aggressive lobbying campaign by MCA to bump the 
station from Lankershim Boulevard onto a site nearer its CityWalk attraction, a 
move that transit planners considered too expensive and time-consuming. After 
days of intensive talks, MCA and Los Angeles County agreed on a city-brokered 
compromise to keep the station on Lankershim but connect it to a shuttle bound 
for Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very happy that it's over," MCA Development President Larry Spungin 
said. "Just as MTA can embark on what it has to do, we can embark on what we 
have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 For MCA, the next step is to consider its options for a people-mover system, 
which would extend for at least 1,000 feet and which the multimedia concern has 
agreed to fund on its own. Technically, the company is not bound to provide a 
shuttle service if it ultimately deems it infeasible, but representatives said 
MCA is committed to trying to make the concept work. 
</P>
<P>
 City transit officials have suggested a monorail-type system that could cost 
as much as $20 million. However, MCA executives say no particular technology 
has been selected or a maximum price established. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just not knowledgeable enough of the problems," Spungin said, adding 
that his company has two years to work out a plan. 
</P>
<P>
 For the county transit authority, Wednesday's agreement means that the 
Universal City Metro Rail project can proceed as planned, without the costly 
delays of further studying station location or scrapping the present plan. 
Construction was scheduled to have begun earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why we really hustled to get this deal closed," MTA analyst Judith 
Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the compromise, the county will pay for two entrances on the 
east side of the Lankershim station in addition to the pair planned on the west 
side. Passengers will be able to exit through the eastern portals via an 
underground walkway beneath Lankershim. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said the $2 million required for the tunnel and extra entrances can be 
covered through various project reserve funds and will not cause any cost 
overruns. 
</P>
<P>
 The transit authority is also responsible for various roadway improvements to 
ease traffic, such as widening Lankershim by 22 feet, and adding new on- and 
off-ramps to the Hollywood Freeway. Those expenses, estimated at between $4 
million and $5 million, are likewise to be incorporated into the present 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement lays to rest a controversy that has engulfed both MCA and the 
county for five months. In the fall, MCA threatened to withhold millions of 
dollars in benefit assessment fees unless MTA moved the subway stop half a mile 
southeast from the present site to one beneath the Hollywood Freeway, near 
Cahuenga Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 County planners said such a change in plans would cost $42 million and delay 
the scheduled July, 2000, opening by nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
 At the prompting of Mayor Richard Riordan -- who was on hand Wednesday to vote 
on the agreement as a transit authority member -- city officials crafted a 
compromise blueprint that satisfied planners' demands to stay on schedule and 
MCA's request that the station better serve its theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MCA executives said Wednesday that although they still would have preferred 
moving the station, the new agreement constitutes a workable compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a 100% solution, but it's good enough to move ahead," Spungin said. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA officials had planned to fly to Washington this week to lobby for federal 
funds to relocate the station. That trip is now off. MCA lobbyists had visited 
the nation's capital earlier this month to seek funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners near the planned Red Line stop also expressed relief that the 
station site had finally been decided. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're thrilled it's over," said Ronni Rice, who owns a nearby condominium 
that will be demolished by the county to make way for the traffic improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she and others will have to move, Rice said she and her neighbors 
were happy to finally know the fate of their properties, which had been 
undecided under the old plan. "We've been held hostage for two years," she 
said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; READING BETWEEN THE LINES; LIBRARIES: CROWDS 
PACK THE ONLY FOUR CITY BRANCHES THAT REMAIN OPEN IN THE VALLEY IN THE WAKE OF 
LAST MONTH'S QUAKE.

 The competition is tough in San Fernando Valley libraries these days. Just ask 
third-grader Vanessa Foster. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, she went to the Encino-Tarzana branch -- one of only four city 
libraries open in the Valley in the wake of the earthquake -- to get a book on 
Abraham Lincoln for a report. Vanessa felt a special tie to Honest Abe because 
they share the same birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the only presidential biography not already checked out was on Warren G. 
Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to write about this President," said Vanessa, 9, looking 
dejectedly at the book about a President best known for the Teapot Dome 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanessa had gotten caught in the post-earthquake, library book crunch. With a 
dozen Los Angeles Public Library branches in the Valley still closed, the open 
libraries are straining under increased patronage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's crazy here," said Sherrill Van Sickle, a librarian at Encino-Tarzana, 
the only city branch open in the West Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the branch had extended hours and had more than doubled its staff, 
library visitors had to wait in long lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 15 people waiting to check out books, others filling out applications 
for new library cards and six or seven people waiting to return books," Van 
Sickle said. "It's crowded to the point of reaching mayhem." 
</P>
<P>
 The modest-sized library, with 42,000 books, had so many visitors Wednesday, 
she said, that some users parked their cars across the street in a paint 
store's parking lot. Before the earthquake, it was the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
 The three other open branches in the Valley -- Studio City, Panorama City and 
Sun Valley -- reported similar strains on their resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Repair work has begun on five of the closed branches -- Canoga Park, 
Chatsworth, Granada Hills, Northridge and Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The work will be completed at the Canoga Park branch in about two weeks, 
according to a status report issued by Robert Reagan, a spokesman for the city 
library system. Then librarians there will have to spend about two more weeks 
unpacking and re-stacking books before the branch can reopen, library official 
Fontayne Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be two or three months before the Chatsworth, Granada Hills and 
Northridge branches reopen. The Woodland Hills branch, which sustained the most 
damage of any in the city library system, will remain closed for about eight 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least these branches are now undergoing restoration. Work has not begun 
on the seven remaining Valley branches. 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes said these branches would eventually also be repaired and reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, many Valley residents have been forced to commute to the 
nearest open branch. Among those is John Lee, a junior at Granada Hills High 
School. Lee, 17, used to drive less than five minutes to the Granada Hills 
branch three times a weeks to do his work, but he now has a half-hour drive to 
the Encino-Tarzana branch. 
</P>
<P>
 When he does get there, he has to battle to find a chair. "There's way too 
many people," Lee said. "All the seats are filled." 
</P>
<P>
 All but two of the closed branches in the city system are in the Valley. The 
restoration cost for the entire system is estimated to be $2.6 million, 
according to the city's Department of General Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the buildings, the report said, sustained severe structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodland Hills branch tops the repair cost list at an estimated $800,000. 
Next is Granada Hills, the busiest of the city's 64 library branches, at 
$600,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The repair estimates do not include costs of returning fallen books to shelves 
and anchoring shelves against future tremors. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the branches in the county library system have reopened, with the 
exception of Valencia, where the damage to the building and collection has been 
estimated at $1.2 million. Many of the books received water damage from a burst 
pipe, said library official Margaret Wong, who added that the branch would 
reopen this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said 39 of its 87 branches were damaged in the earthquake. 
Total restoration costs will be about $2.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meanwhile, Vanessa's older sister had some advice for her disappointed 
sibling. She could still do the report on Lincoln, as long as she did her 
research in the library. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can use the encyclopedia," said Vanessa's sister, pulling out the volume 
on the 16th President.

RIORDAN BACKS YAROSLAVSKY FOR SUPERVISOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's bid for a seat on the county 
Board of Supervisors gained further momentum Wednesday when he won the 
endorsement of Mayor Richard Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky, who has already amassed more than $700,000 in campaign 
contributions, is considered the front-runner for the job being vacated by 
retiring Supervisor Ed Edelman. The mayor's support is nonetheless considered a 
coup for the councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a critical endorsement," Yaroslavsky, 45, said. "No other endorsement 
means more." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said he supports Yaroslavsky because he admires his "record as a 
fiscal watchdog" and because of the councilman's support for the mayor's plan 
to put more police on city streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zev has been one of the city's most tenacious and effective protectors of 
taxpayer money," Riordan said before signing Yaroslavsky's nomination petition 
at a news conference on the steps of City Hall. "Los Angeles will benefit from 
his tremendous skills and talents." 
</P>
<P>
 City Hall insiders and political consultants said Riordan's endorsement 
improves Yaroslavsky's stock in the San Fernando Valley, where Riordan won 
strong support in his mayoral victory in June. Edelman's 3rd Supervisorial 
District covers much of the Valley while Yaroslavsky has represented a largely 
Westside constituency since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mayor's popularity is at an all-time high and the endorsement is very 
important," said Allan Hoffenblum, a Los Angeles-based political consultant who 
has managed several City Hall campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Yaroslavsky said that because of the mayor's increasing 
popularity he believes Riordan's endorsement will help him with voters 
throughout the district, not just in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline to enter the race is March 11. The primary is June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But in making the endorsement, Riordan is also expected to benefit by gaining 
an important ally in Yaroslavsky, regardless of whether he wins the seat or 
loses and remains a member of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 As chairman of the council's budget committee, Yaroslavsky's support is 
crucial for the approval of Riordan's annual budget proposal, which he is 
expected to submit in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "Win or lose, the mayor is going to have to deal with Zev in some capacity or 
another," political consultant Paul Clark said. "So, from a purely political 
standpoint, it makes as much sense as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The only other declared candidate in the race is Don Wallace, a retired Los 
Angeles County Fire Department captain and Edelman deputy, who has painted 
himself as a political outsider and reformer. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he conceded that Riordan's support is a boost for Yaroslavsky's 
candidacy, Wallace called the endorsement "just another part of the power 
structure lining up behind the business-as-usual crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace has raised about $10,000 in campaign contributions.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUNLAND; EXTENSION GIVEN FOR GOLF COURSE PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council voted Wednesday to give developers of a proposed 
golf course in Big Tujunga Wash a six-month extension on the project to settle 
environmental concerns raised by state and federal wildlife officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The extension is the third continuance granted in the past year to Cosmo World 
Corp., which has been working for six years to build the golf course on 355 
acres it owns in the wash in Sunland. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary reason for the delay has been the presence of a small, endangered 
plant in the wash, called the slender-horned spineflower. 
</P>
<P>
 Cosmo has been meeting with state and federal wildlife officials to reach an 
agreement on how to build the project without destroying too much of the 
plant's habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 A supervisor for the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service said all parties are 
still working to reach an agreement on the project and are likely to complete 
the negotiations soon. But he declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Arline DeSanctis, a planning deputy for Councilman Joel Wachs, who represents 
the Sunland area, said the six-month extension will be the last to be granted 
by the city. If an agreement is not reached by the end of the six months, she 
said the project will probably be scuttled. HUGO MARTIN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; CITY ADVISORY PANEL HAS 15 OPENINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Those interested in having a hand in North Hollywood's future are invited to 
seek election to the Project Area Committee, which advises Los Angeles' 
redevelopment program for the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Hollywood committee's annual elections -- open to all residents, 
property owners and business owners in the redevelopment project area -- will 
be held on March 8 at 7 p.m. in the Parish Hall of St. David's Episcopal 
Church, 11605 Magnolia Blvd. Thirteen two-year and two one-year positions in 
five categories will be on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 All positions are non-paying. Candidates and voters must be at least 18 years 
old and be able to show proof of residency within the project area. 
</P>
<P>
 The 25-member committee is a non-governmental advisory panel that works 
closely with the Community Redevelopment Agency to establish budgets and 
implement programs in the North Hollywood redevelopment area, which was created 
to remove blight and spur investment. 
</P>
<P>
 The 750-acre area, which was established in November, 1979, is bounded by 
Hatteras Street on the north, Camarillo Street on the south, Cahuenga Boulevard 
on the east and Tujunga Avenue on the west. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency has spent or pledged $61 million on such projects in the North 
Hollywood redevelopment area as new housing units and the Academy Entertainment 
and Business Center, home of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 Elected positions will be in the following categories: residential 
owner/occupant (four seats), residential tenant (three seats), absentee owner 
(two seats), business owners and tenants (three seats). Deadline for 
registration in the community organizations category (three seats) has passed. 
</P>
<P>
 All elected Project Area Committee members must file a Conflict of Interest 
Disclosure Statement with the city and attend monthly meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates and voters may register at the redevelopment agency's North 
Hollywood office, 5651 Vineland Ave., Feb. 24 and March 3 from 10 a.m. to 2 
p.m.; Feb. 25 from 1 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.; and March 4 from 2 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Although candidates and voters may also register between 5 and 6 p.m. on 
election night, candidates who register before Feb. 25 will ensure that their 
names are on the ballot and will have an opportunity to provide a statement of 
qualifications at the balloting site. 
</P>

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; TRAFFIC OFFICER HAS HEARD IT ALL ON VALLEY 
BEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Running back from a fast-food stand, a hamburger in one hand and a cellular 
phone in the other, he runs toward where his car is being ticketed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just went to get change, but you don't care do you?" the unidentified man 
shouts at traffic Officer Silka Iglesias, then he gets in his white sports car, 
flings the ticket out the window and speeds off. 
</P>
<P>
 To many people, being the regular target of such anger would probably be 
unnerving. But as a traffic officer for the Valley's Parking Enforcement 
Bureau, being one of that select group of women and men who proudly call 
themselves "the most despised people along Ventura Boulevard," it is just 
another day on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Iglesias, a traffic officer for the past five years, has heard it all. 
</P>
<P>
 The "no change routine" falls on deaf ears; it's the most common excuse people 
give for parking at an expired meter. 
</P>
<P>
 "My challenge is 'give me a story I haven't heard,' " the 38-year-old Iglesias 
said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Fulfilling the suspicions of everyone everywhere who ever got a parking 
ticket, Iglesias indeed has a daily productivity quota; she must write at least 
48 tickets a day. She wrote her first $20 ticket for overtime metered parking 
15 minutes after leaving her office in Van Nuys. "They like to see when you 
started your day," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two more were written as she made her way to her beat, which is Ventura 
Boulevard between Kester Street and Van Nuys Boulevard. Normally, she writes 
about 80 tickets a day, she said, which ranks her among the most prolific 
ticket writers in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Frey, who stopped on the boulevard for lunch, was about to walk away from 
his parked car when he noticed Iglesias driving by. 
</P>
<P>
 "I forgot to put money in and then I saw her," said Frey, 43, of Woodland 
Hills, explaining why he ran back to his car. 
</P>
<P>
 As her day goes on, tempers flare. 
</P>
<P>
 "Motorcycle guys protest a lot because they feel like they don't take up a 
whole space," Iglesias said, as she wrote a ticket for a red motorcycle. "But 
if they are in violation they are going to get a ticket." 
</P>
<P>
 As she stuck the ticket on the seat of the bike, the owner ran up. "I just 
stepped off the stupid bike," said Herman Buitrago, 38, of Sylmar. "I'll see 
you in court." 
</P>
<P>
 She waves and smiles as he mutters some expletives and heads off to her next 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, the ticket-avoidance game continues. Some expired meter 
parkers will dart across busy streets to feed another quarter in the meter, 
Iglesias said, while others wait in their cars in a red zone until she leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 After writing a $330 ticket for a black Volvo for parking in a handicapped 
parking spot at La Reina shopping center in Sherman Oaks, two women approach 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I needed to park there!" Kali Morgan, 26, of Valley Village yells at 
Iglesias. "There were no more parking spaces when we came here!" 
</P>
<P>
 Her friend, Crystal James, 33, who owns the Volvo, adds, "And how many 
handicapped people do you find going up to Moby Disc?" 
</P>
<P>
 Iglesias listens to their excuses and points to a metered parking lot across 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a hit-and-run theory," she explains. "In order to not get yelled at, I 
like to give my ticket and go." 
</P>
<P>
 As she enters the metered parking lot behind Tower Records, three men dash in 
different directions, running toward their cars, glancing back at her to see if 
they will make it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is like a game," Iglesias said. "There is a 50-50 chance that you will get 
caught. And even if we don't get you the first time, we will catch you sooner 
or later. All we have is time." JEANNETTE REGALADO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; COUNCIL ENACTS OIL PIPELINE MORATORIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to concerns raised by a massive pipeline fire caused by last 
month's earthquake, the San Fernando City Council Tuesday night enacted a 
45-day moratorium on oil pipeline agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 Aimed at stalling a proposed crude-oil conduit that would cross beneath the 
city, the move puts San Fernando in step with the city of Los Angeles, which 
last week enacted an identical moratorium. It can also be extended until 
engineers submit reports on pipeline safety and investigate 
earthquake-triggered ruptures of the aging Four Corners Pipeline, which runs 
from Kern County to the South Bay and dates from the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil from one of the ruptures, on Wolfskill Street in Mission Hills, ignited, 
seriously burning a man, destroying a house and charring 17 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night's vote was aimed at a proposed Pacific Pipeline Systems Inc. 
pipe segment that would run beneath a railway right of way in San Fernando. The 
underground line would connect Emidio, about 60 miles north of Santa Clarita, 
to Wilmington and El Segundo, and is a key link between offshore Santa Barbara 
oil fields and South Bay refineries. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Pipeline supports the moratorium, and is confident that it can 
convince elected officials and the public that its line is safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We back it because I feel they should settle any concerns they have about 
pipelines," said Norman Rooney, president of Pacific Pipeline Systems Inc., a 
sister company of the Southern Pacific Transportation Inc. "There's been a 
dramatic improvement in pipeline technology in the last 20 years, let alone the 
last 50 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-pipeline activists from Los Angeles tried to persuade the San Fernando 
council to enact a stronger measure and fund its own safety studies, but the 
council balked at the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a 2.5-square-mile city with limited resources and we're trying to 
protect the citizens of our town," Councilman Doude Wysbeek told members of the 
Los Angeles-based Coalition to Prevent the Pipeline and Pollution. "For us to 
(employ) an independent engineer and expend a tremendous amount of city 
resources on a pipeline that we don't even know will come through at this point 
would be foolish." GEOFFREY MOHAN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; CITY APPROVES CUTS IN FEES FOR REBUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Property owners seeking to rebuild their earthquake-damaged structures will 
receive discounts on construction and utility fees from the city of San 
Fernando, provided they start work quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando City Council voted Tuesday night to waive all construction 
permit fees if owners obtain permits and start work within 45 days. The city 
will also waive half the sum for work started between 46 and 90 days, and 25% 
for work begun between 91 and 120 days. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the City Council voted to waive fees usually charged when 
property owners tap into water or sewer lines, and extend a grace period for 
monthly utility and refuse-collection charges if owners reconstruct within six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials project that they could lose $50,000 to $60,000 in utility 
connection fees, about $10,000 to $15,000 per month in construction charges and 
a small but undetermined amount in monthly utility assessments. But they are 
banking on benefits that could be accrued by getting properties back in 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing we're trying to do is encourage people to rebuild, and rebuild 
in a hurry," city Finance Director Mike Moon said Wednesday. "You don't have a 
blighted town, you don't have empty lots, and you have them back on the tax 
rolls and sales taxes come rolling in." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1% return on sales tax revenues that San Fernando receives from the state 
represents about a third of the city's general fund -- the part of the budget 
that pays for such day-to-day expenses as police patrols, according to Moon. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also voted to ask officials from the Los Angeles Unified School 
District to forgive the $1.65-per-square-foot tax it levies on all property in 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando's move follows a regional trend that has emerged after the Jan. 
17 earthquake. Burbank has waived all building fees for 45 days, while Pasadena 
and Santa Clarita have waived them until further notice. The city of Los 
Angeles is weighing similar action. GEOFFREY MOHAN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CANOGA PARK; RETIRING TEACHER HAS BEEN A HERO TO LATINO 
YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They call him the Cesar Chavez of the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a fitting name for veteran teacher Enrique Duran, who has spent about 30 
years encouraging Latino students to believe in themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt I could inspire and push and shove and otherwise kick our students 
into thinking about higher education and careers rather than just jobs," Duran 
said. "I want them to know that just because you are Latino doesn't mean you 
are going to work as a laborer." 
</P>
<P>
 Duran, 59, will retire in June from Canoga Park High School -- the same campus 
where he graduated as student body president 41 years ago. The youngest of 10 
children born to Mexican immigrants, Duran spent weekends and afternoons when 
he was growing up collecting eggs on a chicken ranch in the days when Canoga 
Park was still a rural patchwork of community farms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell my students about my beginnings," Duran said. "Because I want them to 
go further, succeed more than I did." 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from high school, Duran spent two years in the Army and then 
attended UCLA. He worked briefly as an actor, but knew he wanted to teach in 
his neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe Thomas Wolfe, who said you can't come home again," Duran 
said. "I think you can come a long way around and back." 
</P>
<P>
 After 16 years as a drama teacher at Polytechnic High School in Sun Valley, 
Duran seized the opportunity to return to his alma mater. At Canoga Park, Duran 
taught drama for 10 years before switching to Spanish language and literature. 
He also sponsors the Latinos Unidos group on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 In his Spanish literature class of mostly native Spanish speakers, Duran walks 
around the room slowly as he reads or listens to students read. With a mixture 
of humor and gentle prodding, Duran turns a reading of early 20th-Century 
Spanish literature into a discussion about love and the meaning of commitment. 
Students in the class pay close attention, laugh at his jokes and ponder his 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's like a Cesar Chavez to all of us," said Adan Dias, 17, president of 
Latinos Unidos. "He treats Latinos like we are people -- the same as anyone 
else. When people put us down, he teaches us that's baloney. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad to see him go." SUSAN BYRNES

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; COUNCIL OKS CLUB NEAR CITY HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Surprising a group of residents who had spent two hours berating the Burbank 
City Council for its seeming opposition to a proposed restaurant/nightclub in 
the city's downtown, the council granted a permit for the Australian Beach Club 
to open two doors away from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to apologize to Mr. Sherbondy because the process has been long, 
but we have been following the rules," Councilman Dave Golonski said shortly 
before the council voted 4 to 0 to allow Dan Sherbondy to open the business on 
Olive Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bob Bowne, a local lawyer who has an office in the building the 
Australian Beach Club is to move into, abstained from the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherbondy, a former firefighter who said his three-month battle to get the 
club approved has inspired him to pursue law school, said he will now try to 
open the club within 90 days with 35 to 40 employees and a capacity for 200 
diners, plus a dance floor and pool tables. He owns two other Australian Beach 
Clubs, in Orange and San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did what I had to do to open my place," said Sherbondy, who three weeks ago 
accepted 15 additional requirements as a condition of granting a permit to 
open, including added security, paying for taxis for inebriated customers, and 
a prohibition on advertising drink specials. 
</P>
<P>
 But the council balked at approving the permit three weeks ago, saying time 
was needed to study the compatibility of the club so close to the City Hall 
complex. The hearing during that meeting had been marked with cries from 
Sherbondy's supporters that the process was unfair to him. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's meeting, Sherbondy's lawyer, Vincent Stephano, a former Burbank 
mayor, contended that there had been attempts to defeat the club with "the big 
lie," that the club was to be a "sleazy dive with wet T-shirt contests and 
string bikinis." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members had said they were concerned about the compatibility of the 
restaurant with City Hall because of city and civic groups that meet there. 
Another one of the restrictions placed on Sherbondy is that he pay for any 
police calls to the restaurant that exceed three per month, and that his liquor 
license could be revoked if there are more than 30 police calls to the business 
within any 90-day period. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherbondy told the council he had no problems with the condition because, "I'm 
paying for it. So if I get that many (police calls), I'll be out of business."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; REVENUE DROP MAY MEAN CUTS, TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Agoura Hills officials are considering cutbacks in city services and the 
creation of long-avoided taxes to deal with a projected $1-million revenue 
shortfall next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a very difficult budget year, to say the least," City 
Manager Terry Matz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're having a continued negative impact on our sales tax and property tax 
revenues, and we continue to take hits from the state of California." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of state cuts and tax losses, revenues are expected to fall $662,500 
short of the $5.9 million needed to run the city, and another $343,800 short of 
the required insurance and reserve funds in the fiscal year beginning July 1, 
Matz said. 
</P>
<P>
 If that happens, the City Council may resort to utility taxes or special 
assessments for people who live near city-maintained land to offset the 
shortfall, Matz said.  
</P>
<P>
 Agoura Hills has avoided both since it incorporated 12 years ago, unlike 
neighboring cities of Westlake Village and Calabasas in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 The city may also reduce the services it provides, although no cuts have been 
discussed in detail.  
</P>
<P>
 The preliminary budget is not due for another two months, and a citizens 
advisory panel has been set up to begin scrounging for budget solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, we have been mostly information gathering, and we really haven't 
gotten into any of the discussions yet," said Darlene McBane, a member of the 
committee and former city councilwoman.  
</P>
<P>
 "The general recession is making things tight, and we already have an austere 
budget. So any choice we make is going to be difficult," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is expected to consider input of the committee during the 
first week of March.  
</P>
<P>
 Public hearings will be scheduled after the preliminary budget is drafted.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; TEACHERS VOTING ON CONTRACT PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glendale teachers began voting Wednesday to amend their contract with the 
Glendale Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither union officials nor union officials would disclose the terms of the 
agreement, but Glendale Teachers Assn.President Sandi Steinberg said union 
officials were urging members to support it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the offer is a good one, and I think our teachers are going to go for 
it," Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the new contract would take effect from the remainder of this 
school year until June, 1995, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were seeking a salary increase," said district spokesman Vic Pallos. 
"They agreed to a contract settlement for an undisclosed amount." 
</P>
<P>
 Pallos would not say whether the new contract includes a pay raise. Currently, 
a starting teacher in Glendale makes $27,884 per year and the district average 
is $40,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the previous contract has not expired, representatives of the 
Glendale Teachers Assn. formally asked district officials in October to go back 
to the bargaining table under a clause in the agreement that allowed salaries 
to be renegotiated if the district had higher-than-anticipated revenues. At the 
time, teachers were in their third year of a contract that called for no 
cost-of-living adjustments to their wages. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations lasted for three months, and a tentative agreement was reached at 
the end of January, Pallos said. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of the district's 1,200 instructors are union members. They will 
have until 5 p.m. Friday to cast their votes. Results will be determined by 
late Friday or Monday morning, Steinberg said. TOMMY LI

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: CHURCH SHUTTLE TAKES HOMELESS TO SHELTER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Though government funding has run out for a church-run homeless shelter in 
Glendale, the program's coordinator has started a van pool to bring those in 
need to housing locations in Pasadena or Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The makeshift shelter at St. Mark's Episcopal Church closed Monday after 
housing an average of 35 people a night, church officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of cold weather Monday night, some church members decided to drive 14 
homeless people from Glendale to a shelter at the Pasadena Covenant Church, 
said David Earle, who coordinated the shelter program at St. Mark's. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took 11 people in the first two trips in two vans, came back in the one 
van and picked up three more," Earle said. "We gave them bus tokens so they can 
come back in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trying to move them there. We're just trying to give them temporary 
housing for the night." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Mark's had been housing people in its parish hall since Valentine's Day, 
after county officials agreed to fund the shelter for an extra week in light of 
recent storms. City, county and federal officials had originally committed 
$24,000 for a 60-day program, which started Dec. 16 at Glendale Presbyterian 
Church's gymnasium and ended last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers from the Rotary Club and five other churches participated in the 
operation by providing food service and staffing for the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Earle plans to continue his van pool program for the homeless as long as 
weather forecasts call for an overnight low of 40 degrees or a 50% chance of 
rain. Those conditions would prompt nearby churches in Pasadena or Hollywood to 
open shelters, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He hopes government officials will fund a church-run shelter program in 
Glendale next year that lasts an extra month.  
</P>
<P>
 Anyone interested in volunteering a van or being a driver should contact Earle 
at (818) 240-3860. TOMMY LI

WEST HILLS MAN CHARGED IN SHOOTING OF FRIEND, 21 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prosecutors filed assault charges Wednesday against a West Hills man who 
gravely injured a friend when he pointed a rifle at him and pulled the trigger 
in the mistaken belief the weapon was unloaded. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he was arrested Tuesday on attempted murder charges, Russell 
Edward Rayburn, 21, was formally charged only with assault with a deadly weapon 
in Sunday's shooting of John Lopez Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they could not file attempted murder charges against Rayburn 
because they could not prove that the self-employed construction worker really 
intended to kill the 16-year-old from West Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Lopez suffered severe brain injuries and is in critical condition 
at Northridge Hospital Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the shooting occurred shortly after Rayburn had first aimed 
the weapon at Michael Daugherty, another man who was partying Sunday in the 
bedroom of Rayburn's residence in the 6700 block of Royer Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Daugherty told investigators that Rayburn unloaded the weapon and then aimed 
it at Lopez. But there was still at least one round in the gun. When Rayburn 
pulled the trigger, a bullet was discharged, hitting Lopez in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Rayburn called 911 to report the shooting and was arrested Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert L. Cohen said Rayburn was charged with two counts of 
assault with a deadly weapon, for pointing the weapon at both Lopez and 
Daugherty. He was also charged with one felony count of obliterating the serial 
number on the weapon and with being an ex-felon in possession of a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing in Van Nuys Municipal Court, Rayburn pleaded not guilty to the 
charges. A preliminary hearing in the case is scheduled for March 10. Until 
that time, Rayburn will be held in lieu of $115,000 bail.

COUNTY COMMISSION BACKS BUILDING RESTRICTIONS FOR MALIBOU LAKE; DEVELOPMENT: 
RESIDENTS SUPPORT MOVE AS STEP TOWARD PROTECTING SECLUDED COMMUNITY FROM FIRE. 
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WILL MAKE FINAL DECISION ON THE MATTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A controversial set of building restrictions intended to ease the danger of 
wildfires around the mountain community of Malibou Lake was approved Wednesday 
by the Los Angeles County Regional Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they wanted tighter restrictions, residents of the secluded hamlet 
applauded the move as the first step toward protecting their community from the 
sort of firestorm that roared through the Santa Monica Mountains in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best we could do, and we recognize that," said Joel Schulman, 
treasurer of the Malibou Lakeside Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 But owners of vacant lots around the man-made lake south of Agoura Hills 
complained that the new rules would make building on their land too expensive 
and selling it all but impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes you pay to have a decent house," said Phyllis Daugherty, spokeswoman 
for the Malibou Lakeside Vacant Landowners. "Why should we have to pay extra to 
build on what we've already been paying taxes on? This is a misuse of the 
process." 
</P>
<P>
 The rules approved Wednesday must still be reviewed by the Board of 
Supervisors. If passed by the board, the Malibou Lake Community Standards 
District would make permanent a set of temporary restrictions in effect since 
January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials hope that the guidelines developed for Malibou Lake can be 
applied in other mountain communities prone to fast-moving brush fires, such as 
Topanga. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the rules, new houses must have four parking spaces and interior fire 
sprinklers, and can cover no more than 15% of the lot. In addition, builders of 
new homes can be required to widen streets near their property to accommodate 
firetrucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction proposals that do not meet the requirements must be reviewed 
through the county's conditional-use permit process, which can cost as much as 
$4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A landowner had challenged the constitutionality of the guidelines in court, 
but a judge threw out the lawsuit in July, saying the issue should pass through 
the regular county approval process before a suit could be heard. Opponents 
said they may now launch another legal challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 The need for stricter guidelines emerged three years ago when residents 
complained about new construction proposed for their community, which is 
connected by a network of narrow, winding roads.

 They protested that more houses and more cars would make it nearly impossible 
to escape during a brush fire. Owners of vacant land agreed that fire danger in 
the community was high, but they complained that residents had added to the 
threat by making illegal -- and possibly substandard -- additions to their 
homes.

MAN FOUND NOT GUILTY IN 9 ROBBERIES; COURTS: GILBERT DAVID MICHAELS OF NORTH 
HILLS WAS FOUND TO BE INSANE WHEN HE TOOK PART IN STEALING NEARLY $1 MILLION 
FROM THE VALLEY BANKS.

<P>
 A federal court judge found a North Hills man not guilty by reason of insanity 
for his role in stealing nearly $1 million from nine San Fernando Valley banks, 
prosecutors said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge A. Wallace Tashima rendered his verdict Tuesday, following an agreement 
by prosecutors and defense attorneys stipulating that Gilbert David Michaels, 
51, committed the robberies but was insane at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U. S. Atty. Christopher Tayback said his office chose to accept the 
defense plea because numerous psychiatrists who evaluated Michaels found that 
he was insane when he committed the robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 Michaels was indicted along with James Ambrose McGrath on 18 counts of bank 
robbery with firearms violations. A federal jury convicted McGrath on all 
counts in October and he was subsequently sentenced to 30 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Tayback said McGrath displayed more violence during the robberies than 
Michaels. A hearing to determine Michaels' mental state has been scheduled for 
March 28. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI captured Michaels and McGrath in March, 1992, after the robbery of a 
Home Savings of America branch in Woodland Hills. Both men were also charged 
with robbing a Tarzana bank of $430,000, the largest amount ever taken in a Los 
Angeles bank robbery.

EPA ORDERS BURBANK FIRM TO TEST SOIL FOR CONTAMINANTS; POLLUTION: AIRCRAFT 
MAINTENANCE COMPANY IS TARGETED IN AN EFFORT TO CLEAN UP THE AREA'S TAINTED 
GROUND WATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Continuing its drive to clean up chemically tainted ground water in the San 
Fernando Valley, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has ordered a Burbank 
aircraft maintenance firm to test soil and ground water to determine if it 
contributed to the pollution problem. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials said Wednesday they issued a formal order to Pacific Airmotive 
Corp. because the firm refused requests by the EPA and the California Regional 
Water Quality Control Board to complete testing at its property on Hollywood 
Way in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Airmotive officials have performed some tests and "feel like they 
don't need to go further," said Thomas P. Mintz, EPA associate regional 
counsel. But Mintz said further tests are needed to determine if the company is 
among those that leaked solvents into the ground water, causing the cities of 
Los Angeles, Burbank and Glendale to idle municipal drinking water wells. 
</P>
<P>
 A Pacific Airmotive official did not return a phone call. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting under the federal Superfund toxic cleanup program, the EPA and regional 
water board are investigating scores of companies to determine which will be 
charged for current and future cleanup work. 
</P>
<P>
 A small ground water treatment plant is in operation in North Hollywood and a 
group of companies, led by Lockheed, has to undertake construction and initial 
operation of a large treatment system in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 If Pacific Airmotive refuses to comply with the order, it could be fined up to 
$25,000 per day, Mintz said. Otherwise, the EPA could pay for the testing 
itself and recover the costs plus punitive damages, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The testing is intended to determine if the firm spilled or leaked 
trichloroethylene (TCE) or perchloroethylene (PCE), chemical solvents that are 
the most prevalent ground water pollutants.

2 SERIOUSLY HURT AS 3-CAR CRASH ENDS PURSUIT; PACOIMA: WOMAN INITIALLY STOPPED 
FOR RUNNING STOP SIGN IS BOOKED ON SUSPICION OF DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE. 
</P>

<P>
 A North Hollywood woman driving a stolen truck who fled from a motorcycle 
officer Wednesday after she was stopped for running a stop sign caused a 
three-car crash that critically injured a FEMA claims adjuster, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anna Marie Hernandez, 27, who is known to police under half a dozen aliases, 
was booked on suspicion of felony driving under the influence, Los Angeles 
Police Detective Jim Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, who may have been under the influence of cocaine at the time of the 
crash, suffered a fractured pelvis and leg in the crash, Mann said. She was in 
serious condition at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills, a nursing 
supervisor said. Authorities said Hernandez submitted to a toxicological test 
at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent Holsinger, 29, of Mackinaw City, Mich., a building inspector under 
contract to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, suffered massive head and 
chest injuries in the crash, a Holy Cross nursing supervisor said. He was 
listed in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The chase, which covered less than one mile, began when an officer pulled 
Hernandez over about 10 a.m. at Paxton Street and Arleta Avenue, authorities 
said. When the officer walked up to the vehicle, Hernandez drove off, 
initiating a chase, Officer Jim Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer chased Hernandez east on Paxton at speeds in excess of 60 m.p.h. 
until reaching Laurel Canyon Boulevard, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez lost control of the truck when it bounced over a drainage dip in the 
road and slammed into a FEMA vehicle driven by Holsinger, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact sent Holsinger's car off the road. Hernandez's speed caused the 
truck to continue east and hit another car behind Holsinger's, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Connie Ainsworth, 25, of Burbank was treated for minor injuries at Pacifica 
Hospital of the Valley in Sun Valley, Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the truck had been reported stolen several days ago in Pacoima.

JUDGE REMOVES SELF FROM CASE OF DEPUTY ACCUSED OF SEX WITH INMATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge granted a defense request Wednesday and removed herself 
from a case involving a sheriff's deputy accused of having sex with a female 
jail inmate in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Mary Ann Murphy removed herself from the case after Paul Kinion, an 
attorney representing defendant Larry Fraize, 43, filed a motion to disqualify 
her from hearing the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinion said he did not believe the judge would give Fraize a fair trial. 
Murphy had refused to dismiss charges against Fraize during a December hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 A former bailiff in Van Nuys Superior Court, Fraize was videotaped performing 
a sex act with a jail inmate during a sting operation last May, authorities 
allege. He was also taped watching two female inmates having sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraize was charged with engaging in a consensual sex act with an inmate and 
with aiding and abetting sexual contact between two other inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinion contends that his client could not be prosecuted for engaging in a 
consensual sex act because the law he stands accused of violating applies only 
to inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Alan Yochelson maintains that Fraize can be prosecuted 
under the law as an accomplice to the sex acts. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy reassigned the case to Superior Court Judge Judy Champagne. A pretrial 
hearing in Champagne's courtroom has been scheduled for March 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraize, who has been suspended, could be sentenced to two years in prison if 
he is convicted.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; FIRMS GET 60 DAYS TO MOVE FOR NEW METROLINK 
STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rushing to qualify for federal disaster dollars, the city plans to give four 
Sierra Highway business owners just 60 days to relocate so the city can 
demolish their structures and build a Metrolink station. 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires the city to give a tenant at least 90 days to vacate under 
normal circumstances. But Lancaster staff members urged the City Council on 
Tuesday to use its earthquake-related emergency powers to cut that time to 30 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council compromised on 60-days notice, providing some relief to 
business owners who have not yet lined up new quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still going to be a very tight squeeze for us," Alan Frisch, owner of 
The Woodpecker, a cabinet-making business, said Wednesday. "I don't think 60 
days is enough time. But we all understand that this is a special project, and 
there are special circumstances involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want to be treated fairly." 
</P>
<P>
 The city is trying to speed up the relocation of Frisch's shop and three other 
businesses on the east side of Sierra Highway, just south of Lancaster 
Boulevard, to make way for a covered Metrolink train station and paved parking 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The station must be finished by July 16 to qualify for federal funds reserved 
for new rail projects that serve commuters whose travel was disrupted by the 
Northridge earthquake, Lancaster officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster set up an interim platform and an unpaved lot on the east side of 
the Southern Pacific railroad tracks a few days after the Jan. 17 quake. But 
because those tracks are needed for freight trains, Metrolink is building a 
second set of commuter rails that will require the platform to be at the Sierra 
Highway location. 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to buy this land from Southern Pacific. But before it can build 
the station, the city must clear the four businesses that lease their property 
from the railroad. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's council meeting, two business owners said they were confused 
about how soon they would have to move and how much compensation they would 
receive from the city. They said they could not look for a new location until 
they knew how much money they would receive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't blame them for the statements they're making," said Steven H. Dukett, 
the city's redevelopment director. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday night, he said the city was waiting for reports from two appraisers 
on the value of the four businesses. On Wednesday, the appraisals arrived, and 
Dukett said the four business owners would receive offers for their buildings, 
equipment and fixtures this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Dukett said the city will help the owners find new sites and provide money for 
moving costs and any temporary loss of income. The city will seek reimbursement 
through federal aid programs.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ANTI-GANG UNIT HOPES T-SHIRT WILL MAKE TAGGERS 
THINK TWICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The city's Anti-Gang Task Force, which successfully pulled T-shirts promoting 
illegal activities from store shelves last August, is now selling a T-shirt of 
its own. 
</P>
<P>
 The black shirts being sold for $5 on school campuses and at city offices 
depict two wolves urinating on a rock. The adjacent panel shows two youths 
spray-painting graffiti onto a wall. The caption reads: "What's the diff?" The 
panels are in white, with yellow illustrating both the paint and urine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to figure out a way to appeal to the teens and make tagging 
uncool," said Gail Foy, city public information officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The illustration by political cartoonist Randy Wicks of Newhall originally ran 
in The Signal newspaper six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't see a whole lot of difference between the wolves and the 
graffiti-ists marking their territory," said Wicks, who gave permission to the 
task force to use the cartoon at no cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Wicks acknowledged some may find the picture offensive. That, he said, is part 
of the message. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did it because I feel strongly about it," said Wicks. "I'm just glad to be 
a small part of helping fight a growing problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Graffiti incidents have tapered off in Santa Clarita in recent months. About 
40 to 50 monthly calls have come in to the city's phone line to 
graffiti-removal volunteers since August, down from about 120 a month during 
the same time period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping with my fingers crossed the kids won't take it as a challenge to 
go out and do more graffiti," said Sgt. Lee White, head of the anti-gang unit 
of the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station. "I hope the shirt catches on. I 
know the taggers won't buy any." 
</P>
<P>
 The city task force had 500 of the shirts printed, and will make more if they 
sell out. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we want to do is cover the cost of the shirt," Foy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shirts will be sold for $5 each at student stores on Santa Clarita's 
public junior high and high school campuses beginning next week, Foy said. They 
are also available at Santa Clarita's temporary city offices. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, the group had three T-shirt styles pulled from the shelves of the 
Hot Topic store in the Valencia Town Center, fearing the shirts suggested 
criminal behavior was acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 One recalled style featured a man with a bottle of white-out correction fluid, 
with the applicator brush removed and the word "Rave" above it. Authorities 
were concerned the image encouraged sniffing the fluid to get high.

GIRLS' SWIMMING AND DIVING '94 / SIX TEAMS TO WATCH; MARINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach: John Wright (first year). 
</P>
<P>
 1993: Third in the Sunset League; eighth at Division I championship meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Adrienne Leight, So.; Alison Mijares, Jr.; Regina Rebello, So.; 
Kristi Rietzel, So. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Robin Beauregard, Fr.; Lori Martinez, Fr. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Wright begins his 11th year coaching the boys but inherits the girls' 
team for the first time and looks forward to what this group will accomplish 
over the next few years. "I think we'll do real well," he said, "and regardless 
of our success, we'll be very good the next two or three years." Marina is 
young, and its depth is suspect, but it has a gem in Mijares (second, 500-yard 
freestyle; third, 200 free at section meet). Marina dominated the league in the 
mid-1980s, and with the exception of one season Edison won the title, Fountain 
Valley has won every championship since. Wright again expects a two-team league 
race between the Vikings and Fountain Valley. Newcomers Martinez (sprint 
freestyle) and Beauregard (backstroke, butterfly) should make an immediate 
impact.

<P>
 Coach: Debbie Fleming (11th year). 
</P>
<P>
 1993: Second in the Empire League; 10th at Division I championship meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Amy DeBolt, Sr.; Adrienne Paradeise, Sr.; Jamie Rubino, So.; 
Tatum Schubert, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Joanna O'Kelley, Fr.; Leigh Schubert, Fr. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: It's comeback time. Los Alamitos owned the Empire League, with titles 
from 1984 to 1991. But after back-to-back second-place finishes to El Dorado, 
Los Alamitos thinks this year marks the return of the Griffins. "I'm excited 
about this year," Fleming said. "I think we're going to be really good." Why 
the confidence, considering El Dorado's fifth-place finish at the section meet? 
Two words: Kella Hoblick, last year's co-swimmer of the meet for El Dorado -- 
she defended her titles in the 200 individual medley and 100 breaststroke -- 
has transferred to Fresno to work out with her old coach. DeBolt (team 
captain), Paradeise (sixth, 50 freestyle; sixth, 100 butterfly) and Tatum 
Schubert (eighth, 100 backstroke) anchor the Griffins.

 Outlook: After a hum-ho sixth-place finish at the section meet in 1992, 
Mission Viejo rebounded in 1993, losing the championship to El Toro, 167.5 
points to 160.5. It's never a pretty sight when a swimmer as talented as 
sophomore Terah Gisolo moves, but the Diablos won't miss too many beats with a 
slew of other talented tadpoles. Murphy is simply one of the best backstrokers 
around. She finished second in 1993 at the section meet, where she and winner 
Alyssa Resch of Dos Pueblos swam under the section record. Kuser, a 
long-distance freestyler who had an injured shoulder last year, is being 
recruited by Princeton and won a $5,000 swimming scholastic All-American award 
over the winter. She was a section finalist in the 200 and 500 freestyles her 
sophomore year.

graduates Jennifer Maxwell and Darcy Stuart took third through sixth for 
valuable team points. The addition of Pace gives the divers more strength. But 
the Cougars have the swimmers -- last year's youth movement is a year older -- 
to make a legitimate title run. Returners from the championship 200-yard 
freestyle relay are Carone, McCalley and Povey. Only Kim Davis, a sprint 
freestyler who moved to Northern California, is gone. All three relay members 
were finalists in individual events. Carone is a top backstroker (seventh in 
100) and butterflier (second in 100).

GIRLS' SWIMMING AND DIVING '94 / SIX TEAMS TO WATCH; IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach: Scott Hinman (ninth year). 
</P>
<P>
 1993: Sea View League champion; third at Division II championship meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Taryn Beard, Sr.; Lauren Henne, Jr.; Alice Huszcz, Jr.; Monica 
Huszcz, Sr.; Melissa Lloyd, So., diving; Wendy O'Brien, Jr.; Molly Zak, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Amy Aldinger, Fr.; Lana Kraus, Fr.; Erin Rollins, Fr.; Debbie 
Wold, Fr. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Irvine was impressive in its Sea View League debut last year, winning 
the title. This season, "barring disaster, we'll win, place or show," Hinman 
said in reference to the team's chances in league and at the section meet. 
Irvine boasts only one senior, Monica Huszcz, and the Vaqueros lack the 
power-packed names, but they can creep up on you. Their relays are lethal. 
Irvine finished second in the 400-yard free relay and seventh in the 200 medley 
and return three swimmers from each. Traditionally, Irvine has faltered in 
qualifying individuals for the championship meet, but Hinman believes that's a 
problem of the past.

<P>
 Coach: Sheri Ross (25th year). 
</P>
<P>
 1993: South Coast League champion; Division I champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Kenesha Jespersen, So., diving; Katie Lowes, So.; Katie 
Simmons, So.; Amy Sloan, Jr., diving; A.J. Walters, Sr.; Becky Wilshire, Jr., 
diving. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Christie Kennedy, Fr. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: The top three places at the Division I championship meet were a clean 
sweep for the talent-heavy South Coast League, and El Toro led every step of 
the way. The Chargers won a school-record eighth league championship and every 
meet -- dual, invitational, postseason -- they entered, including their 
first-ever section championship. This year, the finish could be eerily similar, 
though Ross said depth might be a concern. The most prominent name missing is 
Michelle Perry, winner of three consecutive 100-yard section freestyle titles, 
who now swims for UCLA. As much publicity as Capistrano Valley divers get, El 
Toro has some threats of its own. Sloan, Jespersen and Wilshire finished 
second, eighth and 12th at the section meet, and all are back.

MANNING AWAITS FATE AFTER CLIPPER LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A ballboy handed Danny Manning a plastic bag before Wednesday night's game 
against the Portland Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's this?" Manning asked as he opened it. 
</P>
<P>
 It was filled with T-shirts along with a note asking Manning to autograph them 
for the Clipper cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Sportscaster Rich Marotta walked into the locker room with a camera and asked 
a reporter to take a picture of him standing next to Manning. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is for my wall of fame," Marotta told Manning. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning displayed little emotion before and after what could have been his 
last game as a Clipper. He scored 26 points as the Clippers lost to the Trail 
Blazers for the second consecutive night, 121-112, before 8,847 at the Sports 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans pleaded with Clipper Coach Bob Weiss to take Manning out in the final 
minute so they could give him an ovation, but Weiss ignored them. Manning, who 
made 10 of 24 shots and had nine rebounds and five assists, took a three-point 
shot from the right side that glanced off the rim with 12 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the Eagles' "Already Gone" played over the public address system 
at the start of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 As Manning stepped to the podium to address a crowd of reporters after the 
game, he said: "Is this the final time we do this?" 
</P>
<P>
 The leading scorer in Clipper history with 7,120 points in 373 games, Manning 
was asked to summarize his Clipper career, "Bittersweet," he said. "Bitter 
because we probably haven't won as many games as I would have liked us to, 
sweet because I got a chance to establish myself in this league and I got a 
chance to live in a great city and I enjoyed it while I was here." 
</P>
<P>
 Will he spend today waiting by the phone? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my son's birthday, and I don't answer the phone to begin with," Manning 
said. "If I'm traded, I'll get word somehow." 
</P>
<P>
 Did Manning have any special emotions? 
</P>
<P>
 "Nope," he said. "Who's to say that it's my last game in a Clipper uniform? 
Who's to say it's not?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers are likely to trade Manning, who could be an unrestricted free 
agent at the end of the season, by today's 6 p.m. PST NBA trading deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Clippers have closely guarded their intentions, there is growing 
sentiment among NBA general managers that they will deal Manning, the NBA's 
seventh leading scorer with a 23.6 average, to Atlanta for Dominique Wilkins, 
the NBA's sixth leading scorer with a 24.4 average. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins said before last week's game against the Clippers that he can't worry 
about trade rumors. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper owner Donald T. Sterling huddled with his chief lieutenants, Elgin 
Baylor and Andy Roeser, at midcourt during Wednesday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning said he's grown weary of the speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is getting old," Manning said with a laugh. "I'll be honest with you." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers had the opportunity to trade Manning to Miami for forwards Glen 
Rice and Willie Burton last October, but the deal fell through. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Grinker, Manning's agent, claimed that Sterling vetoed the deal, however 
the Clippers say their executive committee of Coach Bob Weiss, Baylor and 
Sterling nixed the deal because they believed that they might be able to 
re-sign Manning. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it quickly became clear that their perception was wrong. While 
Manning has had the best season of his six-year NBA career, his contract status 
and the loss of center Stanley Roberts because of an Achilles' tendon injury, 
seems to have had an unsettling effect on the Clippers, amid their worst season 
since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know what's going to happen, but it's been really tough for the guys 
in general," guard Mark Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper forward Charles Outlaw, whose 10-day contract expires today, said he 
hasn't been given an indication whether the Clippers will sign him to another 
10-day contract.

MIKE DOWNEY: LILLEHAMMER / '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; AFTER HARDING STUMBLES, BAIUL, 
BONALY CONTEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The woman who seven weeks ago screamed, "Why me?" shouted to the world 
Wednesday night, "Why not me?' 
</P>
<P>
 To the question of who will win the women's figure skating in the Winter 
Olympics, resilient Nancy Kerrigan, mugged 49 days ago by a man with a blunt 
instrument and left bruised and crying, has picked herself up, dusted herself 
off and come back good as new. Flawless on opening night, Kerrigan left the 
arena in first place and laughing, while leaving America's other skater, Tonya 
Harding, in 10th place and gagging. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan's principal opposition in Friday's freestyle program for the gold 
medal will come from Oksana Baiul of Ukraine and Surya Bonaly of France -- not 
from Harding, who even with her acrobatic freestyling is too far behind. 
</P>
<P>
 The civil war between Nancy and Tonya? 
</P>
<P>
 That one's over. 
</P>
<P>
 Coughing from asthma and sneezing from an allergic reaction to flowers 
presented to her after her performance, Harding departed the Hamar Olympic 
Amphitheatre with virtually no chance of winning any medal -- gold, silver, 
bronze or good-conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan, in contrast, could hardly have felt any better after the shower of 
flowers that descended toward her. With spectators clapping along in 
encouragement throughout her 2-minute 40-second technical program, and with an 
estimated 70 to 80 million Americans expected to view a delayed telecast of it 
back home, the willowy Kerrigan skated as carefree and naturally as though out 
on a frozen pond by herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Harding applauded. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan's reaction: "I'm really proud of myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Both women actually competed with admirable composure considering the goldfish 
bowl that had become their world. Kerrigan, in particular, was in rare form, 
earning no score lower than 5.6 (of a possible 6) from the panel of nine judges 
and even four 5.9s on her presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a performance worth waiting for, one Harding herself viewed from a 
private, glass-shielded box. Kerrigan skated nearly 2 1/2 hours later than 
Harding, who landed awkwardly enough on a double flip that she received no 
score higher than 5.6 -- with even a couple in the 4's. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding nonetheless pronounced herself satisfied, saying: "It went good. I was 
ready. I went out and did it. I'm happy with my performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Nine other performances were superior to Harding's, however, including one by 
Germany's 28-year-old Katarina Witt, winner of two gold medals during the 1980s 
who was thought to be over the hill. Witt returned strictly as a lark and 
placed sixth for the evening, in spite of being petrified beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
 One would have thought that Kerrigan, 24, of Stoneham, Mass., had more reason 
to feel fearful, but she is leader of the pack with Friday's telltale freestyle 
program yet to come. The 1992 bronze medalist's principal opposition for a gold 
this time will be Baiul, 16, and Bonaly, 20, of France, each of whom is 
eminently capable of winning her country's first gold medal in this event. 
</P>
<P>
 Baiul, dressed like a ballerina, skated to "Swan Lake" and occupied first 
place until Kerrigan came on, next-to-last among the 27 skaters on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Nervous? 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan said afterward: "It would be weird if I wasn't a little nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 From the first stride, though, her knees were steady and ice water coarsed 
through her veins. To a tune called, "Desperate Love," Kerrigan demonstrated 
the grace and almost double-jointed agility that had been her signature before 
the Jan. 6 assault that was meant to sabotage her career. Seven of the nine 
judges graded her in first place by the time she glided to a stop, and 5.9s for 
presentation were hers from judges representing Poland, China, Japan and the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan's costume was cute and conservative -- black at the neck and 
shoulders with an apron of white. She looked like a carhop. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding came dressed like a Las Vegas cocktail waitress. No shrinking violet, 
right to the end, Harding wore an outfit that was scarlet and sleeveless, with 
a bright red bow in her hair and brighter red rouge on her cheeks. For the 
23-year-old skater from Portland, Ore., innocence is an appearance she is not 
wont to convey, although Harding did begin her program with hands folded in 
prayer and concluded it with a curtsy. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently the only human being in Norway who still believes she has a chance, 
Harding, when asked at what point she would feel successful, said afterward: 
"When I have a gold medal around my neck. That's when I'll feel like I've 
achieved what I came here for." 
</P>
<P>
 While waiting for her scores, seated beside Diane Rawlinson, her coach, 
Harding was presented a bouquet of flowers. She promptly had a sneezing fit. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's allergic to flowers," Rawlinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding began to leave, to light applause from a mostly polite audience that 
had acknowledged her original introduction with a smattering of whistles and 
jeers. Then, adding illness to insult, Harding began crouping from an asthma 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 She granted an interview only to a U.S. Olympic Committee official, and spoke 
as though she were in second place, not 10th. Never once did Harding give even 
the slightest hint of concession that her gold-medal chances were nil. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she took a seat and did what everybody else did. 
</P>
<P>
 She watched Nancy Kerrigan skate as though nothing had ever happened. 
</P>
<P>
 * FIRST TEST: Nancy Kerrigan has chance for a gold medal while Tonya Harding 
is all but out. A1.

LILLEHAMMER / '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; BLAIR'S LATEST PERFORMANCE IS A TREASURE; 
WOMEN'S SPEEDSKATING: THE AMERICAN WINS 1,000 METERS FOR SECOND GOLD MEDAL OF 
THESE GAMES AND FIFTH OVERALL, BECOMING ALL-TIME LEADER AMONG U.S. WOMEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 She was 19 when she finished eighth in the 500 meters of the 1984 Winter 
Olympics in Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Speedskater Bonnie Blair cocked her head in recollection Wednesday night, 
smiled and said: "At that time, at that age, I thought I had won. I thought 
finishing eighth was a victory in itself." 
</P>
<P>
 She is 29 now and has experienced the real thing more often than any other 
U.S. woman Olympian. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair blasted into history by winning the 1,000 meters Wednesday night with 
her fastest time since the 1988 Calgary Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 She set an Olympic Hall record of 1 minute 18.74 seconds, the only skater in 
the field of 36 to beat 1:20. 
</P>
<P>
 Anke Baier of Germany was second at 1:20.12 and Qiaobo Ye of China was third 
at 1:20.22. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair said she will skate through the World Championships in her new hometown 
of Milwaukee next February but insisted this was her last Olympic race. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four more years? I'm too old for that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If so, she goes out with five golds, one more than diver Pat McCormick, 
sprinter Evelyn Ashford and swimmer Janet Evans. 
</P>
<P>
 And she goes out with six medals in all, a Winter Games high for a U.S. woman 
and second overall to swimmer Shirley Babashoff, who won two golds and six 
silvers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gone beyond anything I've ever dreamt about," Blair said. "Maybe in time 
I'll realize exactly what all this means, but right now all I can think about 
is the enjoyment I've experienced participating in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, it seems like the Olympics have always got me going no matter what 
kind of year I've had. I'm sad to know this was my last race, but I certainly 
have a lot of good memories." 
</P>
<P>
 Tough, durable and seemingly immune to pressure, Blair fought off tears on the 
victory stand, then let them flow while hugging her mother, Evelyn, 73. 
</P>
<P>
 She later donned the gold cap that distinguished the Blair Bunch, her 
60-strong cheering section of family and friends, and held up a large U.S. flag 
while skating a victory lap with Olympic mascots Haakon and Kristin. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Auch of Canada, who finished eighth and has been competing against Blair 
since before Sarajevo, said of her friend and rival: 
</P>
<P>
 "The big part of it is thinking anything is possible. I mean, I knew Bonnie 
when she wasn't very good. That may be hard to believe, but it's been a long 
haul. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's worked hard and never quit on herself, and a big part of it, too, is 
she's followed guys like Nick (Thometz, now her coach) and Dan (Jansen) and 
skates very much like a guy. She's very strong, very powerful. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can you say? She's definitely special, incredibly talented. I don't 
think anybody compares with her. She's dominated the sprints for almost a 
decade and could probably continue as long as she wants." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Ye, a rival on and off the ice, offered grudging admiration. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like she comes on in the Olympic years," she said in English. "She's 
really strong this year. Nobody can beat her in the 500 and 1,000. To win five 
golds is very good, I have to say. I wish I could get one gold." 
</P>
<P>
 Ye finished second to Blair in both the 1,000 and 500 of the 1992 Olympics, 
only 0.02 back in the 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 However, knee surgery last August cost her a chance for gold, Ye said. 
</P>
<P>
 At 29, she said this was her last race, and she couldn't stop the tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cry because I couldn't do my best, and that makes me sad," she said. "I 
still have pain. I couldn't control my knee well enough to keep a low 
position." 
</P>
<P>
 Six years ago, at the World Sprints before the Calgary Olympics, Ye failed a 
doping test and returned to China, she said later, in humiliation, contending a 
Chinese doctor had given her a mixture of herbs and mushrooms to control a skin 
problem and she was not aware that it contained banned substances. 
</P>
<P>
 Suspicions persisted, however, and Blair, uncharacteristically, has not let it 
rest, often saying she can only do her best "no matter what others put in their 
bodies." 
</P>
<P>
 Ye, training recently in Wisconsin, said of Blair, "I don't like her anymore. 
I don't like such people. I made a mistake that wasn't mine. She shouldn't 
belittle me. I belittle myself enough by remembering." 
</P>
<P>
 Against this tense background, Blair and Ye were paired in the second twosome 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair, however, said she was relaxed and confident from the start and raced 
from a perspective of "never having feared anything or anyone." She also said 
she benefited from having to chase Ye, on the inside lane, for most of the 
first lap. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's always good for me," she said. "It makes me realize there's more 
involved than the clock." 
</P>
<P>
 Blair and Ye shook hands and put arms around each other on the victory stand, 
but exchanged neither greetings nor glances while icily sitting beside one 
another during a subsequent news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to review her Olympic moments, Blair cited the awe of her debut in 
Sarajevo, a world-record 500 in Calgary that she considers the most special of 
the golds, two victories in Albertville after she had been skating poorly, and 
two more in Hamar as the culmination of another up-and-down year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Norwegian fans are absolutely fabulous, and this arena is terrific," she 
said. "The Olympics are unique. I hope to always be involved in some way. It 
will be hard to stay away." 
</P>
<P>
 Harder yet to forget her. You can look it up.

RAMS TARGET MITCHELL, MOON FOR QUARTERBACK; FOOTBALL: THEY INVITE DOLPHIN FOR A 
VISIT, WHILE CONTACTING OILERS ABOUT POSSIBLE TRADE. FALCONS' MILLER ALSO A 
POSSIBILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams have designated free agent Scott Mitchell of Miami and Warren Moon of 
Houston as their top quarterback candidates, and have arranged a visit for 
Mitchell on Tuesday as well as contacting the Oilers about a possible trade for 
Moon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams seek to trade quarterback Jim Everett and either sign Mitchell or 
trade for Moon, whose $3.25-million salary is forcing the Oilers to deal him to 
stay under the new $33.8-million salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd Reese, the Oilers' assistant general manager, confirmed Wednesday that 
the Rams and the Detroit Lions have expressed interest in Moon, but have not 
begun formal talks. 
</P>
<P>
 John Shaw, Rams' executive vice president, said the Rams have made several 
inquiries about Moon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Houston hasn't got back to anyone," Shaw said. "We have inquired about 
several quarterbacks who are with teams." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw refused to reveal who those players were. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would rather not say because those players may or may not be (up for 
trade)," Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moon, 37, who finished last season as the AFC's 10th-ranked quarterback, 
passed for 21 touchdowns and 21 interceptions. Houston probably will ask for 
the Rams' two second-round choices in the April 24-25 draft -- the 33rd and 
47th overall -- in return for Moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, 26, will meet with team officials at Rams Park on Tuesday but will 
not work out. Atlanta's Chris Miller, an unrestricted free agent, also is 
scheduled to visit Rams Park next week, although concerns about his frequently 
injured left knee have placed him behind Mitchell and Moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell has visited Detroit and Minnesota and has planned trips to Washington 
and New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 Rarely used until this season, he improved his free-agent status when he 
replaced injured Dan Marino as the Dolphin starter, completing 133 of 233 
passes for 1,773 yards with 12 touchdowns and eight interceptions. 
</P>

 Miller, 28, threw 15 touchdown passes with only six interceptions through 
eight games in 1992 but has played only three games since tearing a knee 
ligament against the Rams that season. 
</P>
<P>
 He underwent knee surgery on Nov. 2 1992, then started two games and played in 
another last season before going on the injured reserve list because of another 
injury to his left knee.

MICKELSON CAN SLEEP LATE TODAY; GOLF: THERE'S NO NEED TO GET UP EARLY TO MAKE 
HIS TEE TIME AT TORREY PINES, WHERE HE COMES HOME AS DEFENDING CHAMPION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Phil Mickelson was 8 or 9 when he played his first round of golf at Torrey 
Pines. It was not particularly memorable, except perhaps for how it curtailed 
his sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played with my Dad," he said, "and we had to get here real early to get a 
starting time. We were here at 5:30 or 6 to get off by 9:30 or so." 
</P>
<P>
 In that sense, things have not changed much at Torrey Pines. 
</P>
<P>
 However, things have changed for Mickelson. He has a 10:37 starting time this 
morning, when he tees off as the defending champion of the Buick Invitational. 
At 23, he is already a four-time winner on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickelson is unbeaten as a professional in his home county. He won this 
tournament last February, then started this year with a playoff victory over 
Fred Couples in the Mercedes Championship at La Costa. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickelson is paired with Payne Stewart, the only 1993 top-10 player in the 
field, so they probably will be followed by a Sunday-type gallery for the first 
two rounds. They play the North Course today and the South Course Friday, after 
which the field will be trimmed to the top 70 and ties for the final two rounds 
on the South Course. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickelson smiled. "It's nice to be staying in the house I grew up in," he 
said, "and playing in front of people I know and played golf with." 
</P>
<P>
 The pairing -- Mickelson and Stewart -- is a repeat of the one for the first 
two rounds last year, when Mickelson won and Stewart finished third. They also 
played together that Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I remember about those first two rounds," Mickelson said, "was that 
Payne shot two great rounds -- six under (par) -- in the worst weather you 
could imagine." 
</P>
<P>
 In cold, windy conditions, Mickelson opened with a 75, the highest first-round 
score for the winner of a 1993 tour event. He shot 69s in the second and third 
rounds and closed with a 65, his lowest score ever at Torrey Pines. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather was almost perfect for Wednesday's pro-am this year. If it sticks 
around for the weekend, it will take a score considerably lower than the 
10-under-par total Mickelson had last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the person who wins won't have spent much time in the rough," Stewart 
warned. "There's major league rough out there, U.S. Open-type rough."

 Randy Will and Brian Shimer won the two U.S. berths in the four-man bobsled 
competition Saturday and Sunday as Jim Herberich was eliminated in a two-heat 
race-off.Shimer came from behind in the second heat to edge Herberich by 
two-hundredths of a second. Shimer's 52.53 seconds on that run was the second 
fastest in a field of 34 sleds. Will had the field's second-fastest run in the 
first heat, 52.01. 
</P>
<P>
 "I let out a big sigh of relief," the veteran Shimer said of his near 
elimination. "I thought my time was really slow. I was having flashes all the 
way down. I surprised myself." ROSS NEWHAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lots of people will look back on these Winter Olympics as an unforgettable 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's Kristin Matta. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had better vacations," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Matta, director of communications for the U.S. Figure Skating Assn., is the 
U.S. Olympic team's press attache for figure skating at the Games. 
</P>
<P>
 That assignment, of course, has thrust her in the middle of the never-ending 
Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan saga. She probably has been the most in-demand 
person at these Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was talking to my mom (in Costa Mesa) after I'd been on TV at a news 
conference and she said, 'You were the one with the dark circles under your 
eyes, right?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for all, Matta, a former figure skater herself, has kept her poise 
-- and her sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets funny sometimes," she said. "The (non-CBS) TV crews were desperate to 
talk to anybody, so if you walked by with a USA jacket, you were fair game. But 
the morning Tonya arrived, one TV crew was all set up and didn't want me to 
walk through the door, just in case Tonya might be coming out." 
</P>
<P>
 Were she not so principled, Matta could have made a killing in the market -- 
the fish market. 
</P>
<P>
 "One British journalist -- I thought he was with a tabloid but he said he 
wasn't -- offered me a large quantity of smoked herring if I would feed him 
inside stuff on Tonya and Nancy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A large quantity? 
</P>
<P>
 "Half a ton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him, 'If you give me only one smoked herring I'll never speak to you 
again.' It takes more than fish to bribe me."  
</P>
<P>
 Matta was put off a bit by the media attention Harding and Kerrigan drew the 
morning of their first skate-together practice in Hamar, but said she 
understood it. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was pretty sad because the Games were on and there were so many other 
great athletes performing and being ignored," she said. "But it is a big story 
and everybody's doing a job." 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, Matta said, everybody connected with figure skating was saying, 
"Nothing can top this!" at every new development. 
</P>
<P>
 "We quit saying it," she said. "Every time we say that, something does." 
</P>
<P>
 Matta said she never figured on dealing with this kind of thing when she took 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'll always look back on it in a positive light," she said. "It's been an 
enormous learning experience." MIKE KUPPER

DIGEST: CSUN VOLLEYBALL AIDES NAMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lian Kang Lu, Cal State Northridge's new women's volleyball coach, completed 
his staff on Wednesday, announcing the hiring of assistants Carolyn Hueth and 
Maria Reyes-Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
 Hueth, 23, Lu's top assistant, was an assistant coach at Mira Costa High the 
past two seasons. She was a four-year starter at Pepperdine, a three-time team 
captain and the West Coast Conference player of the year in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes-Sanchez, 24, was team captain at UC Santa Barbara in 1990-91 when Lu was 
an assistant coach there.  
</P>
<P>
 She was the team's most valuable player and an All-American selection in 1991. 
Reyes-Sanchez is UCSB's all-time leader in digs and service aces. Football 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge's football recruiting class reached six on Wednesday when Coach Bob 
Burt announced that Virgil Nelson and Anthony Fernandez, defensive linemen from 
Citrus College, have signed NCAA letters of intent. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, 6-2, 250, is expected to play defensive end. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez, 6-4, 257, will play tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 "They give us solid depth at that position," Burt said. "They're solid, 
mature-type people." 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors have defensive line starters Oscar Wilson, Chris Smith and Tim 
Gardner returning next fall. Baseball 
</P>

 Rupert Sapwell is a junior in athletic eligibility, but this will be his final 
season at Cal Lutheran. He expects to graduate in May before starting his 
career in the National Basketball League in his native Australia later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very, very intelligent," Coach Mike Dunlap said. "He has just torn 
through the academic schedule here. He has something like a 3.8 average." 
</P>
<P>
 Sapwell, a 6-6, 220-pound forward, is averaging 11.7 points and 6.6 rebounds, 
and ranks 17th on Cal Lutheran's career rebounding list with 402. 
</P>
<P>
 Emeka Okenwa has moved to 12th on The Master's career rebounding list with 
577. Okenwa has averaged 9.8 rebounds a game during his two seasons at the 
school.

VENTURA IS SOFT AROUND ITS MIDDLE; WRESTLING: COUGARS' WEAKNESS IS THE STRENGTH 
OF EL MODENA, WHICH BOASTS SECTION CHAMPIONS AT 130 AND 135 POUNDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The most successful wrestlers on the Ventura High team are in the lowest and 
the highest weights, but for the Cougars to have a chance in tonight's Southern 
Section Division I team championship match, the Cougars must depend on the 
middle. 
</P>
<P>
 El Modena, Ventura's opponent at 7:30 p.m., is strongest in the middle 
weights. Teak Sato (130 pounds) and Juan Alvarez (135) won Southern Section 
titles last weekend. David Wells, who lost in the 140 final, was section 
champion in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura got a good look last weekend at the strength of the top-ranked 
Vanguards. 
</P>
<P>
 El Modena (24-1 in dual meets) dominated the Division I individual 
championships at El Monte, winning with a meet-record 153 points. Ventura 
finished a distant second with 92 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura (18-1) does possess a top wrestler in the middle weights. Chris 
Karlowsky (140 pounds) advanced from the individual championships to this 
weekend's Master's meet but will likely be matched against Wells. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Coach Paul Clementi hopes to get a lead early, hold on in the middle 
weights, and take his chances with the heavier weights. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're still alive by 189 (pounds), then we're dead," El Modena Coach 
Alan Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavyweight Sean Burdick is Ventura's only individual champion. Last week, 
Burdick clinched the Cougars' semifinal victory when he pinned Santa Ana's 
Frank Picos with one second left in the first period. Ventura was trailing, 
25-24, at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Burdick's younger brother, Ryan (189 pounds), adds to Ventura's strength in 
the upper weights. Ryan advanced to the quarterfinals in the individual 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 At 103 pounds, Ryan Atherton (35-9) has provided Ventura with a quick start to 
most meets. He finished second in the individual championships for the second 
consecutive year.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think our best will win and their best will win," Clementi said. "It's 
what's in the gray area that will decide the champion." 
</P>
<P>
 The teams met in the semifinals last season, with El Modena winning, 39-18.

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: AT THE START, CSUN NEEDS A FEW RUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Offense having some ups and downs? Trouble in the leadoff or cleanup 
positions? For the Northridge baseball team, the answer to each of the above is 
a resounding yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven runs is precisely how many the leadoff batter has scored. Joey Arnold 
(nine games) and Keyaan Cook (one) are a combined eight for 41 (.195). 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold has accounted for all of the six runs driven in by the leadoff spot. 
Northridge leadoff men have struck out 12 times. 
</P>
<P>
 The production the Matadors (4-6) have received out of the fourth spot in the 
lineup also is disappointing. Juniors Jason Shanahan and Kevin Howard and 
freshman Eric Gillespie have batted a combined .293, but have only three runs 
batted in while batting cleanup. And they all came when Howard hit a three-run 
homer to beat UCLA, 10-7. Overall, the Matadors' No. 4 hitter is 12 for 41 and 
has scored seven runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Bill Kernen continues to tinker with the batting order. 
</P>
<P>
 After Monday's 10-5 loss to Fullerton, seven of nine regulars were moved to 
different spots in the order before Tuesday's game with USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still don't know a lot about this team," Kernen said. "I need to find some 
answers before (Western Athletic Conference play) begins." CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
<P>
 Mounds of Mounties 
</P>
<P>
 The gang's all here, practically. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's game with UC Santa Barbara was unofficially a Montclair Prep 
reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Mountie standouts Steve Cain, a pitcher, and infielder Shad Knighton 
are on the Gaucho roster. Montclair Prep's former pitching coach, Tim Montez, 
is coaching at Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge also has three former Mounties in uniform, including second baseman 
Cook and injured first baseman Andy Shaw. Shaw's older brother, P.C., is a 
Northridge assistant and a Montclair Prep graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 Cain, who pitched two innings of scoreless relief, came within an out of 
earning the victory against the Matadors, but former El Camino Real standout 
Pat Treend gave up three runs in the ninth to blow a save opportunity while 
Northridge rallied to win, 13-12. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Through 10 games, Northridge (4-6) has yet to defeat a team with a winning 
record. Victories have come against Cal State San Bernardino, UC Santa Barbara 
and two over UCLA, all of which remain below the .500 mark. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Northridge opens play in a tournament at the University of Florida 
in Gainesville. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors play Oklahoma State (ranked sixth by Collegiate Baseball), 
Florida (22nd) and a doubleheader against Ohio State (16th). 
</P>
<P>
 USC, which on Tuesday defeated Northridge, 10-5, was ranked 13th. Cal State 
Fullerton, which swept a pair of games from the Matadors last weekend, is 
ranked third. 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen believes the Matadors, who are unranked, may be suffering from an 
inferiority complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "These teams are better than we are right now," Kernen said, referring to USC 
and Fullerton. "(Winning) is a mental expectation that comes with experience. 
Until it's in your head that you belong on the same field. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a wall to knock down." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Chevalier, Northridge's shortest player, finally found an opponent he 
physically could pick on. 
</P>
<P>
 Matched against Earl Thompson, Sacramento's 5-9 freshman point guard, 
Chevalier posted up on Thompson and called for the ball early in the second 
half against the Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
 After gathering in a pass, Chevalier backed in, spun around Thompson, and 
scored with a layup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to tell them I've got skills at the post," Chevalier said. "I rarely 
get someone smaller than me, but I finally did it. It took me four years, but I 
got one." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Chevalier, after 10 Northridge players saw at least 14 minutes of 
action in a 36-point blowout win over Cal State Sacramento: "It was fun just to 
see other people play and sit on the bench and listen to them get yelled at." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Call it trial and error or baptism by fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Whichever, Scia Maumausolo and the Matador softball team learned early the 
benefit of being a quick study. 
</P>
<P>
 Maumausolo was an All-American designated hitter as a freshman last season, 
but for at least this campaign Northridge needs her to play catcher. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Matadors' season-opening doubleheader, Cal State Fullerton tested 
Maumausolo's arm and found it not nearly as strong or quick as her bat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans stole three bases and earned a split. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, in the San Diego State tournament, Cal State Long Beach and 
Washington also tried playing fast and loose on the bases. Tried and failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Maumausolo threw out three runners in two games, and turned in the key 
defensive play in a 1-0 extra-inning victory over the Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
 In the tournament's tiebreaker format, a runner is placed at second base at 
the start of an inning.  
</P>
<P>
 Maumausolo picked off the Washington runner, snapping the ball down to center 
fielder Jen Fleming, who sneaked in from behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a real break, to get that front runner out," Coach Gary Torgeson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bottom of the inning, Northridge scored its runner and came away with 
the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more she plays the better she'll get," Torgeson said of Maumausolo. "She 
has all the tools. She just needs game experience." 
</P>
<P>
 And, apparently, not too much of it. JUNIOR COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 Hanky-Panky 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps they ought to move the pitchers' mound closer to the plate. Or 
blindfold the batters. Anything to help those poor junior college baseball 
pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider what happened to some of them over the past few days. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Saturday, Antelope Valley and Oxnard took advantage of gusty winds in 
Lancaster to stage a 30-22 slugfest, won by the Marauders. 
</P>
<P>
 Can you just hear the public address announcer?: 
</P>
<P>
 "That's 30 runs on 30 hits and three errors for Antelope Valley. For the 
Condors, 22 runs on 17 hits and seven errors. Both teams thank you for 
enduring." 
</P>
<P>
 There were 15 home runs in the game, including two each from Antelope Valley's 
Eric Cole and Oxnard's Andy Wilson and Matt Anderson. Ryan Branch hit a grand 
slam for Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen anything like that, even in Little League," said Joe Watts, 
the Marauders' co-coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "That wind was howling by about the third inning. There were some routine fly 
balls that just kept carrying." 
</P>
<P>
 The wind, however, had nothing to do with the Southern California Athletic 
Conference doubleheader the same day in Sylmar between Compton and Mission. 
</P>
<P>
 The Free Spirit swept Compton, 11-1 and 16-3, by displaying a lot of muscle. 
Mission hit four home runs in the second game, including one by outfielder Gary 
Matthews, who also had the only home run of the first game. 
</P>
<P>
 Then on Tuesday, Ventura dismantled the Tartars with a 19-hit attack for a 
29-3 nonconference victory at Compton. Freshman third baseman Hernan Martinez 
had a school-record nine runs batted in. He picked up seven of the RBIs with a 
grand slam and a home run with two men on. 
</P>
<P>
 Do those white hankies being waved by the pitchers mean anything? CAL LUTHERAN 
</P>
<P>
 Bigger Is Better 
</P>
<P>
 After producing their worst field-goal shooting performance (27 of 75, 36%) of 
the season in an overtime basketball loss to Pomona-Pitzer last week, the 
Kingsmen rebounded with their best shooting half of the season (22 of 32, 
68.8%).  
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran raced to a 59-24 lead at intermission against Claremont-Mudd on 
Saturday night, then cruised to a 95-66 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went very hard on Thursday, Friday and Saturday," Dunlap said. "We met 
five times (between Wednesday's loss and Saturday's victory) and none of us 
were happy. We were all grumpy and we took it out on Claremont." 
</P>
<P>
 Claremont-Mudd's loss turned out to be Cal Lutheran's gain as the angry Stags 
upset Pomona-Pitzer, 82-64, on Monday night to give the Kingsmen a share of 
first place in the SCIAC standings with one game left. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran (22-2, 11-2 in the conference) can guarantee itself at least a 
share of its third consecutive SCIAC title with a victory over La Verne 
tonight. The Kingsmen would win the title outright if they defeat La Verne and 
Pomona-Pitzer loses to Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
 A SCIAC title playoff game would be played Saturday at a neutral site to 
determine the conference's automatic entry into the NCAA Division III playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran and La Verne tied for the SCIAC title last year, and La Verne 
beat the Kingsmen for the championship and knocked them out of the playoffs in 
the second round after Cal Lutheran was granted an at-large berth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen baseball team trailed The Master's, 8-0, after an inning and a 
half on Monday even though the Mustangs had only one hit, a looping single. 
</P>
<P>
 In Master's first two at-bats, four Mustang batters were hit by pitches and 
eight received bases on balls.

KEEPING TABS / DANA HADDAD: MARDI GRAS DOESN'T DISTRACT MADISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Aside from playing three basketball games, Tony Madison hardly ventured out of 
his apartment last week. The behavior on the streets was too bizarre for the 
former Antelope Valley College guard. 
</P>
<P>
 People, many of them intoxicated, were running around in strange masks and 
costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 His school -- the University of New Orleans -- was out of session, observing a 
week-long holiday: Mardi Gras. 
</P>
<P>
 Madison and his teammates headed to Bourbon Street one night to catch a 
glimpse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just walked around watching people act crazy," Madison said. "The people 
can just do anything out there. It's like a big, wild party. People screaming . 
. . drinking. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 On the court, Madison made his own festivities. The 6-foot-4, play-making 
guard averaged 19 points in three victories. He capped the week with a 
career-high 33 points and five assists in a 74-64 victory over Texas Pan 
American on Saturday as the Privateers (17-6, 11-4) took over first place in 
the Sun Belt Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I usually come out and hit my first three-point shot and then work the ball 
inside for the rest of the night," Madison said. "But we were struggling down 
low. I made my second three, and then my third. And I said to myself, 'I'm 
taking this all the way.' 
</P>
<P>
 "On some of the shots I was way behind the line. But I felt like they were all 
going in. I was in a zone and I just wanted the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Madison set a Lakefront Arena record for most points by a New Orleans player 
and tied the arena mark for most three-point baskets in a game -- seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Games like this were common for Madison during the 1990-91 season at Antelope 
Valley. He averaged 26.1 points in his sophomore season, second only to J.R. 
Rider's 30.8. But like many guards making the jump to Division I, Madison had 
to shelve his jump shot and concentrate on ballhandling and defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest adjustment was playing defense," Madison said. "We played a lot 
of zone at AV. We play a lot of man-to-man here. I was concentrating on it so 
much, it was affecting my shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 That might be an understatement. At the start of last season, Madison missed 
18 of his first 19 shots. He bounced back to become the Sun Belt's most 
accurate three-point shooter (32 of 74, 43.2%). 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I think I'm becoming a complete player," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 New Orleans Coach Tim Floyd recognized potential in Madison after watching him 
play in a junior college all-star game during his sophomore year. Floyd 
convinced him to come to New Orleans instead of accepting a scholarship to New 
Mexico, as Madison had planned. 
</P>
<P>
 But something got lost in the translation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach Floyd was telling me they needed a shooter," Madison said. "They wanted 
me right then and I was ready to leave. I just went for it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Madison's gun was strapped to its holster. He averaged only 6.5 points 
last season. His average has climbed to 12.9 this season -- second highest on 
the team -- but he has struggled through cold spells. His percentage from the 
field has dropped to 41.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his 33-point outburst, Madison's previous career high was 20, reached 
three times this season. Madison is not exactly filling up the score book, but 
he's not disappointed. Winning has always been more important to Madison. 
</P>
<P>
 His teams won at Dorsey High, they won at Antelope Valley. Now, New Orleans is 
winning. Before Wednesday night's game at Southwestern Louisiana, Madison's 
collegiate record was 95-22 and 56-7 in conference games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winning is what I'm all about," he said. "Last year, we got a look at the 
NCAA (tournament, losing in the first round to Xavier). This year, we're 
winning the conference. We're peaking right now. We're trying to get an 
automatic bid, and I think we can make something happen in postseason." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Checking the fax: Guard Reggie Phillips (Ventura College) leads NCAA Division 
II defending national champion Bakersfield (20-5) in scoring at 15.4 points per 
game. He had made 53.5% of his shots. Although only 5-10, he ranks second on 
the team in blocked shots (10) and third in steals (25). He scored 27 and 23 
points in the past two games. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Kevin Franklin (Taft High) leads Division III power Oklahoma City (20-5) 
with a scoring average of 14 points a game. His percentage from three-point 
range (44.2%) is nearly as good as his overall percentage (45.1). . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Bell (College of the Canyons) has been Quincy's leading scorer in eight 
of the past 10 games and its leading rebounder in seven. In the games in which 
he led the Hawks, Bell averaged 25.4 points and 12.7 rebounds. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Former Cal Lutheran baseball coach Rich Hill picked up the 200th victory of 
his career in San Francisco's 4-0 defeat of San Jose State on Tuesday. Jason 
Chandler (Granada Hills) pitched a three-hitter, improving his record to 3-1. 
USF is 6-4 in Hill's first season. DANA HADDAD

 Citing severe real estate-related problems, Eldorado Bancorp on Wednesday 
reported the first year-end loss in the bank's 21-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tustin-based bank reported a net loss of $1.72 million, equal to 63 cents 
per share, for the fiscal year ending Dec. 31.This compares with net income of 
$2.76 million, or $1 per share, reported for 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a difficult year. California's four-year recession resulted in a 
further decline in real estate values, which was the major reason for the 
bank's losses," said J.B. Crowell, president and chief executive officer of 
Eldorado Bancorp. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, the company reported a net loss of 
$326,000, or 12 cents per share, compared with net income of $137,000, or 5 
cents per share, for the same quarter of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank reported total assets of $323.3 million for 1993 as compared to 
$340.6 million for 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 The company set aside $3.6 million in 1993 for possible loan losses, 
increasing total reserves to $4.7 million. In addition, the company took $4.4 
million in real estate write-downs on distressed properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Eldorado Bancorp, through its principal subsidiary, Eldorado Bank, operates 
through 10 banking offices in Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's stock was down 37.5 cents in trading Wednesday closing at $7.125 
per share on the American Stock Exchange.

 HomeBase's Stickman used to tell TV viewers that home improvement projects are 
simple. Not so anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine-based chain of do-it-yourself stores launched a campaign last week 
saying that it has hired experts and retrained its workers to help 
customers.The company's employees, portrayed by actors and actresses, capably 
handle paint rollers and table saws. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the seven commercials shows a class filled with HomeBase "employees" 
learning how to serve their customers. They fix problems ranging from kids' 
crayon art on the dining room wall to a fork stuck in the garbage disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Created by Lord, Dentsu & Partners in Los Angeles, the $15-million campaign 
will begin airing in colder climates in mid-March. Spanish-language ads are 
scheduled to begin later in the month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stickman campaign "had great awareness and was wonderful when we changed 
from Home Club to HomeBase," said Dave Kenshol, vice president of marketing. 
"But it didn't adequately communicate our strengths."

 "The marketplace has shifted to outsourcing," he said. "A lot of companies 
have downsized, and they are looking for strategic partnerships with other

HUGHES TO SHARE GRANT FOR TRANSIT SYSTEM PROJECT; CONVERSION: FIRM'S FULLERTON 
PLANT WILL USE PENTAGON FUNDS TO MAKE RADAR SENSORS FOR BART. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hughes Aircraft Co. said Wednesday it will share a $19.5-million grant to use 
military radar technology to double the traffic capacity of the Bay Area Rapid 
Transit system in the San Francisco area. 
</P>
<P>
 The award is part of the Pentagon's technology reinvestment project, which 
earmarks federal funds for projects that promise to convert military technology 
to commercial uses. 
</P>
<P>
 The aerospace company's Fullerton plant will work with BART and train-maker 
Morrison Knudsen in Boise, Idaho, to develop radar sensors for trains that will 
tell traffic engineers exactly where each train is located during use, said 
Robert Singer, a Hughes program manager. He said the program, as envisioned, 
could employ 400 to 500 high-tech workers for at least a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 This precise data on the system will allow engineers to shorten the spacing 
between each train moving at a full speed of 70 m.p.h. from 2.5 minutes now to 
about 90 seconds, enabling traffic engineers to place more trains on a given 
stretch of tracks and doubling traffic capacity without compromising safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The Defense Department on Wednesday announced 50 grants worth $190 million, 
the fourth round of technology reinvestment awards to teams of companies and 
organizations that applied for the grants during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Other grant winners included Rockwell International Corp. in Seal Beach, which 
proposed a $7.2-million project to significantly reduce the cost of radio 
frequency components used in analog and digital communications, and a team made 
up of Loral Western Development Labs, UC Irvine and Georgetown University 
Medical Center, which proposed a $2.8-million project to develop an all-digital 
radiology Picture Archiving and Communications System for hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Each member of the Hughes-Morrison Knudsen team will contribute matching funds 
to the project, bringing its value to $39 million.

 BART, which will add 34 miles of track to its 71 1/2-mile regional rail system 
in 1995, needs the extra capacity as it lays tracks between the suburbs of 
Dublin and Pleasanton, said Marv Swensen, manager of train-related programs at 
Hughes in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Dugger, a BART spokeswoman, said that doubling the system's capacity 
across the San Francisco Bay by conventional means, such as building new 
tracks, would cost an estimated $4 billion. She said the new technology could 
allow BART to run 30 trains per hour instead of 16, enabling the transit system 
to carry 60,000 more passengers a day during rush hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "BART is the first in a number of upcoming urban transit upgrades," Singer 
said. "We think the technology could be used to upgrade systems in New York, 
Atlanta, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C." 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes' Fullerton unit developed what it calls the Enhanced Position Location 
Reporting System, a mobile data communications network that could secretly 
transfer orders, to help troops find their location without relying on 
landmarks and to pinpoint friendly troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes' stock, listed as General Motors Class H on the New York Stock 
Exchange, closed at $35.50 a share Wednesday, down 50 cents. Morrison Knudsen 
stock also fell 50 cents to $25.75 a share in NYSE trading. 
</P>
<P>
 In related news, the state of California's Office of Strategic Technology 
approved $3.7 million Wednesday for 16 defense conversion projects that had 
originally applied for federal funding. Among the recipients of the $250,000 
grants were the Beckman Laser Institute and Medical Clinic in Irvine and the 
California Council on Science and Technology in Irvine.

RAMS SHOOTING FOR MOON OR MITCHELL AT QUARTERBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams have targeted free-agent Scott Mitchell of Miami and Houston's Warren 
Moon as their top quarterback candidates and have set their plan in motion by 
contacting the Oilers about a possible trade for Moon and arranging a visit for 
Mitchell next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are looking to trade quarterback Jim Everett and either sign Mitchell 
or trade for Moon, whose $3.25-million salary is forcing the Oilers to deal him 
to stay under the new $33.8-million salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd Reese, the Oilers' assistant general manager, confirmed Wednesday that 
the Rams and Detroit Lions have expressed interest in Moon but have not begun 
any official trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
 John Shaw, Rams' executive vice president, said the Rams have made "several 
inquiries" about Moon. Ram Coach Chuck Knox refused comment, referring all 
questions about Moon to Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
 "Houston hasn't got back to anyone," Shaw said. "We have inquired about 
several quarterbacks who are with teams." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw refused to reveal who those players are. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would rather not say because those players may or may not be (up for 
trade)," Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moon, 37, finished the 1993 season as the AFC's 10th-ranked quarterback (21 
touchdowns and 21 interceptions). Houston will probably ask for the Rams' two 
second-round draft picks in the April 24-25 draft -- the 33rd and 47th overall 
-- in return for Moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, 26, will meet with team officials at Rams Park Tuesday but will not 
work out. Atlanta's Chris Miller, an unrestricted free agent, also is scheduled 
to visit Rams Park next week, although concerns about his oft-injured left knee 
have made him a second priority behind Mitchell and Moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell visited Detroit on Tuesday, Minnesota on Wednesday and has planned 
trips to Washington and New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 Rarely used until this season, Mitchell improved his free-agent stock when he 
replaced an injured Dan Marino as the Dolphins' starter. He was 3-4 as a 
starter, completing 133 of 233 passes for 1,773 yards with 12 touchdowns and 
eight interceptions but missed a month with a separated shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, 28, threw 15 touchdown passes with only six interceptions through 
eight games in 1992 but has played only three games since the ninth week of the 
1992 season, when he tore his anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee 
against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller underwent reconstructive knee surgery Nov. 2, 1992, then started two 
games and played in another last season before going on the injured reserve 
list with another left knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides a quarterback, the Rams are spending the free-agency period, which 
started Friday, in search of a wide receiver, an offensive tackle, and a kick 
and punt returner. They also are looking for depth at safety, linebacker and 
defensive tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas defensive tackle Jimmie Jones is scheduled to visit the Rams next week. 
Jones, 6-4 and 276 pounds, was a backup for the Super Bowl champions last last 
season.

GYM SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS NOW APTLY NAMED; VENUE: DEMONSTRATING A TOUCH OF 
GALLOWS HUMOR TO COPE WITH THE QUAKE, NORTHRIDGE RE-CHRISTENS ITS BASKETBALL 
ARENA THE EPICENTER. 
</P>

<P>
 What once was simply Matador Gym is no longer. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, a quick-witted public-address announcer expunged the original 
name when he planted tongue firmly in cheek and welcomed visitors to "Southern 
California's premier sports palace . . . The Matadome." 
</P>
<P>
 The fans found it amusing. The players loved it. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that name too has fallen by the wayside. 
</P>
<P>
 In case you missed it, the Cal State Northridge gym last week was 
re-christened. 
</P>
<P>
 Its new name: the Epicenter. A banner draped along the gym's west side made it 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 The tag isn't the most original, but what Epicenter lacks in creativity it 
makes up for in appropriateness. 
</P>
<P>
 A Class-A minor league baseball franchise opened a stadium of the same name 
last spring. But the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes based their entire package on a 
marketing gimmick. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge calling its gym Epicenter is as close as you get to truth in 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 The school was at the center of the 6.7 earthquake on Jan. 17 that caused 
millions of dollars in damage to the campus. Several Matador athletic teams 
were forced to interrupt their seasons to allow players to reorganize amid the 
rubble of condemned classrooms and apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 So now the gym is the Epicenter. Dark humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of people lost their lives in the quake, hundreds their homes. But why 
continue to grouse when you can muster a joke? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of the American way, to laugh at tragedy and make the best of 
things," said Pete Cassidy, Northridge's basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Personally, Cassidy wouldn't mind taking this quake business a step or two 
further. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, how about a change in nicknames. The Quakes, perhaps? The idea 
has been tossed around. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a basketball coach's perspective, 'Matadors' is not the best nickname, 
anyway," Cassidy said. "You know, Matador defense? 
</P>
<P>
 "I could tie into Quakes. If Miami can have the Hurricanes and Iowa (State) 
can have the Cyclones then Northridge should have the Quakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe someday. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Northridge seems to be concentrating on earning its basketball team a 
home-court advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 As if it needed to try. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams visiting the Northridge campus must drive by a collapsed, formerly 
three-tiered parking structure on their way to the gym. Then there is the sight 
of the "classrooms" -- hundreds of trailers and tents. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Southern Utah, tonight's opponent in Northridge's final home game of 
the regular season, started practice Wednesday, Northridge assistant coaches 
made sure they explained the heavy chains that can be seen secured above the 
playing floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The chains are designed to hold up the light fixtures in case of an 
aftershock. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the game, songs such as "All Shook Up" and "Shake, Rattle and Roll" 
will be played over the facility's public-address system. 
</P>
<P>
 Anything to make an opponent think twice. 
</P>
<P>
 But if that is truly the goal, there are other suggestions making the rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Paint a crack or two on the gym floor. 
</P>
<P>
 At mid-court put a big 6.7. 
</P>
<P>
 Take a page from Colorado and Northern Arizona, which emphasize the elevation 
of their respective home floors. In front of the opposing bench stencil, 
"Welcome to the Epicenter -- 6.7." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the game, during introductions, turn out the lights, blare Queen's "We 
Will Rock You" over the sound system, and have Northridge fans shake the wooden 
bleachers by stomping their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 It even has been suggested that the school rent some fake boulders from a 
local film studio and roll them down the bleachers into the visiting team's 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
 The players like that idea. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Tom Samson, a freshman forward, would like to expand on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can we rent some more fans too?" he said.

REPRISE IS MORE REWARDING FOR UPSTART CRESCENTA VALLEY; GOFFREDO LEADS FALCONS 
BACK TO SEMIFINALS IN BASKETBALL DESPITE INJURIES, NEW LINEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Crescenta Valley High basketball Coach John Goffredo looked at his team back 
in November -- at the players he had and the players he didn't -- and figured 
this might be a long season. 
</P>
<P>
 He was right. 
</P>
<P>
 Here it is, the last week in February, and the Falcons are still playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There weren't a lot of high expectations . . . but this team has reached its 
potential more than any other team I've ever had," said Goffredo, the Falcon 
coach for 16 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley (18-9) qualified for the Southern Section Division I-AA 
playoffs as an at-large team after finishing fourth in the Pacific League. The 
Falcons pulled off a stunning upset by beating top-seeded Fontana, 85-77, 
Tuesday night in a quarterfinal game. The Steelers (26-2) were ranked fourth in 
the state by Cal-Hi Sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley is scheduled to meet Santa Ana Valley in a semifinal game 
Friday night at Glendale High. It will be the second consecutive semifinal 
appearance for the Falcons, but last season's team and this season's could not 
have taken more divergent paths. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1992-93 team had a solid group of senior starters, led by Adam Jacobsen, 
who graduated as the Southern Section's all-time leading three-point shooter. 
The Falcons were ranked among the top 20 teams in the state and took no one by 
surprise when they advanced to the semifinals in the Division II-AA bracket. A 
61-51 loss to Dominguez ended their season at 22-5. 
</P>
<P>
 But all five starters from that squad graduated. The most significant returnee 
was 6-foot-4 junior Brock Jacobsen, Adam's younger brother. But he was useless 
the first month of the season because he suffered a broken wrist playing 
football with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the projected front line, 6-foot-3 sophomore Mike Greco and 
6-foot-10 junior Blake Jacobson, also were injured. Jacobson suffered a 
sprained ankle and returned after a few weeks. Greco shattered bones in his 
left arm trying to win a $20 bet by making a 360-degree dunk. He has missed the 
whole season. 
</P>
<P>
 The inexperienced Falcons played in three tournament championship games during 
December. They lost them all. "We were just not mature enough to pull off a 
win," Goffredo said. 
</P>
<P>
 They lost to the top teams in the league -- Glendale, Muir and Pasadena -- 
during the first round of the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley lost its gym to the Jan. 17 earthquake. The Falcons have been 
practicing at junior high schools and parks in the area, and playing games at 
Glendale College or Glendale High. Saturday, the team practiced outside for the 
first time in Goffredo's tenure. It seems a badminton class was using the gym 
at Glendale College. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing was going our way this year," Jacobson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Falcons came together after the earthquake. They successfully 
controlled the tempo against running teams Pasadena and Muir, beating both the 
second time through the league. 
</P>
<P>
 They used the same strategy to beat Sierra League champion Nogales in the 
first round and Citrus Belt champion Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we had to control the tempo or (Fontana) would be out there 
fast-breaking and dunking all over us," senior guard Richard O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Goffredo: "It was like the game plan was absolutely perfect. We didn't 
want to run with (Fontana). We wanted to set up and take the shots that we 
wanted and we put them down." 
</P>
<P>
 The two hottest shooters are O'Neill, who is averaging 23.2 points a game, and 
Jacobsen, who has steadily raised his average to 20.8 points. The key for 
Jacobsen has simply been his health. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been shooting extremely well," Goffredo said. "I don't think it's 
anything other than his wrist feeling good. He's scoring the way I thought he 
would." 
</P>
<P>
 He scored 38 and 19 in the first two playoff games. After he scored 33 against 
Fontana, he heard from Adam, now playing at Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't believe we are doing this good," Brock Jacobsen said. "He said we 
have a great coach and if we just keep playing hard, we can keep winning."

CONTRERAS SUCCEEDS REARDON AS RIO MESA FOOTBALL COACH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 George Contreras, a former head football coach at Westlake High for 11 years, 
has been named coach at Rio Mesa, succeeding John Reardon, who resigned in 
January after 26 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras, 46, who served as an assistant at Rio Mesa the past five seasons, 
was a natural selection to replace Reardon, who hinted about retirement before 
the start of last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras led Westlake to a 58-57 record from 1978-88, and his teams won a 
Frontier League championship in 1979 and Marmonte League titles in 1980 and 
'82. Before joining Westlake, Contreras was an assistant at Thousand Oaks for 
eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, being here was a big plus in terms of just knowing the kids and 
the coaches who were on hand," said Contreras, who has taught government at Rio 
Mesa since 1989. "There are a lot of things about being a head coach that are 
attractive." 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras will face a rebuilding job. Rio Mesa (6-4 overall) finished fifth in 
the Channel League last season at 3-4 and failed to qualify for the Southern 
Section Division III playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The departure of Reardon, who compiled a 154-119-4 record over parts of four 
decades, created one of four coaching vacancies. Three other coaches left the 
program for unrelated personal reasons, Contreras said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the first things to do right now is to rebuild the staff," Contreras 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans last qualified for the Southern Section playoffs in 1991 and have 
not won a league title since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Rio Mesa won a section title under Reardon in 1971. VINCE KOWALICK

SOUTHERN SECTION WRESTLING; CALVARY CHAPEL, EL MODENA ATTEMPT TO ADD TO THEIR

 Calvary Chapel and El Modena, two wrestling teams on a roll, will attempt to 
pick up their second Southern Section championships in six days tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Division I and III dual meet wrestling finals will be contested at El 
Modena and Calvary Chapel, on the heels of the Vanguards' and Eagles' titles in 
the individual championships Saturday.It was the fourth consecutive team title 
for Calvary Chapel and the first for El Modena, the top two teams in the county 
all season. 
</P>
<P>
 Century League champion El Modena, which finished second in the individual 
meet and dual Division I championships last year, will meet Channel League 
champion Ventura, runner-up to the Vanguards at Saturday's meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, before losing to Indio in the final, El Modena defeated Ventura, 
39-18, in the dual quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura, strongest at the lighter and heavier weights, has an individual 
champion in heavyweight Sean Burdick, and a runner-up in Ryan Atherton at 103 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 El Modena is packed with talent in the middle classes. Teak Sato (130) and 
Juan Alvarez (135) won championships and David Wells (140) was a finalist. At 
140, the match between Wells and Ventura's Chris Karlowsky should be a 
highlight of the meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills, recent winner of its seventh consecutive Pacific Coast League 
title, meets defending State champion Calvary Chapel. The Eagles' feature five 
two-time Division III section champions in Shane Valdez, Dane Valdez, Mauricio 
Mor, Josh Holiday and Ed Mosely and runner-ups Joe Calavitta, Danny Robinson 
and Matt Van Hook.

THE SCENE: SPREADING LIKE WEED; TEENS LOVE TRENDS. AND THE RESURGENCE OF 
MARIJUANA IS NO EXCEPTION, DESPITE HEALTH WARNINGS FROM DOCTORS, SCHOOLS AND 
PARENTS

 Gina can pick them out of the crowd. They dress in flannels and other grunge 
gear; they go to class after lunch stinking of "bud." It's a ritual that is 
repeated daily for a scattering of students at her Orange County high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Not the "stoner type," Gina, 16, is never asked to join them. Some of her 
friends are "straight edgers" who say no to drugs and snub users. So she tends 
to keep her own weed use to herself.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't do it at parties. I worry a lot about what people think of me. I 
worry a lot (about) everything. I wouldn't do it just to do it," says the Dana 
Hills High School sophomore, who puffs only with her older sisters. "Pot 
relaxes me, and I can think of anything. It makes me more creative." 
</P>
<P>
 While Gina (whose name has been changed, along with those of other students in 
this story) might not share her peers' zeal to light up every day, she is 
counted in the growing scene of high school teens who have significantly driven 
up statistics of illicit drug use -- with marijuana heading the list -- in the 
past two years, according to a federal report issued earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 As one Estancia High junior put it: "Pot's become really trendy." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it's toking to release stress, to seemingly jump-start inspiration or 
just to look cool at a party, high-schoolers continue a tradition of drug 
experimentation. This despite warnings from doctors, schools and parents of 
health risks that can result in lung damage or psychological addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent upsurge is rooted in the '90s renaissance of flower power ideals, 
with many teens figuring their parents survived the era of Woodstock and turned 
out all right. That researchers have determined today's marijuana is 20 times 
more potent than that of the '60s and '70s is either news to them, disregarded 
or considered a fringe benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 The rise has accompanied a widespread attitude shift toward marijuana, which 
was considered counterculture domain by the generation that parented today's 
high-schoolers. The marijuana leaf motif has become the happy face of late, 
emblazoned on baseball caps and T-shirts. Its popularity has been catapulted in 
part by continuing pop-culture favorites such as the Grateful Dead and the 
recent mainstream popularity of reggae and its Rastafarian culture, which 
espouse "ganja" for a spiritual high.

 On a wider scale, credit goes to newer recording artists such as Cypress Hill, 
Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg. Cypress Hills' pot ode "Insane in the Brain" shot 
their debut album "Black Sunday" to the No. 1 slot on the Billboard charts. Dr. 
Dre's album "Chronic" (another term used for marijuana) still claims a 
position, 15 months after its release. Through their music and interviews, 
these self-appointed spokesmen of the current movement convey their mission to 
legalize marijuana and cultivate the plant it comes from -- hemp -- for its 
many practical uses, from medicine to fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of applications for hemp especially appeals to generations 
preoccupied with saving Mother Earth because it is a natural plant. This has 
attracted supporters to the marijuana subculture whose motivation to 
reintroduce hemp farming goes beyond getting high.  
</P>
<P>
 Many clothing companies have been designing a few units or whole collections 
cut from cannabis cloth, a super-strength material that resembles burlap but is 
softer. Because it's made from the fibrous innards of the hemp plant stem, the 
cloth is drug-free. Hemp baseball caps and wallets, by the Hempstead Co. in Los 
Angeles, typically featuring an embroidered marijuana leaf, are hot sellers at 
alternative fashion boutiques such as Sunline Electric Chair in Huntington 
Beach -- despite a price tag that's double that of like products made of 
conventional materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Another item hard to keep in stock at Sunline is a book considered the 
quintessential source on the subject, "Hemp & the Marijuana Conspiracy: The 
Emperor Wears No Clothes," by Jack Herer. First published in 1985 and updated 
almost annually, the book is full of historical, scientific and legal 
documentation, complete with footnotes. Store buyer Jennifer Johnson estimates 
the customers who are primarily doling out the $19.95 for the book are "mostly 
younger kids," between ages 14 to 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Count Mary among them. The high school junior stood in front of her U.S. 
history class last semester reporting how the Declaration of Independence was 
drafted on hemp paper, which accounted for 75% to 90% of all paper in the world 
until 1883. She underscored the environmental positives, such as how one acre 
of cannabis produces as much paper as 4.1 acres of trees. She threw out 
patriotic names like Thomas Jefferson, Bejamin Franklin and George Washington 
as entrepreneurs of hemp product. Mary capsulated centuries of hemp history 
during her 10-minute presentation. She got an A. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before she took her first hit two years ago, Mary says she was well 
versed with Herer's book and had attended several local rallies to legalize 
hemp. Now she smokes it daily, alone or with friends. She adds hard liquor to 
the scene on the weekends. Pot puts her in a "thinking mood . . . sometimes. My 
mom thinks it's fine as long as it doesn't interfere with my life." 
</P>
<P>
 She's rarely ditched class in the past to party, figuring it's not that tough 
waiting until the end of the school day to get stoned, which she does every 
chance she gets. "Ditching parties," which are still widespread among Los 
Angeles high-schoolers, are apparently considered passe among Orange County 
students; they don't need to skip school, because they can use eyedrops to 
relieve the telltale redness.  
</P>
<P>
 Mary keeps a B average in her classes, even with her after-school secretarial 
job. The part-time work covers a bag of "swag" (lower quality marijuana), which 
can cost $15, or 1/8-ounce of prime "skunk," which goes for $60. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even think pot's a drug. It's completely natural," Mary says. 
</P>

 Estancia High junior Mize generally prefers his buds pure, but at some parties 
he's smoked a bowl of "coco puffs," a mixture of pot with cocaine. The varsity 
athlete and his friends say they find that popular recipes such as lacing 
joints with PCP or dipping them in solvents and insecticides adulterate the 
natural essence of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reality. I don't like it. I like the reality of being stoned," says Mize, 17, 
a five-year veteran of weed who frequently gets stoned with his mother. "If I'm 
going to do something, I have to take a bong hit. It's the first thing I do 
when I wake up. We do it during breaks between classes. This way we're never 
sober." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Mize has to consciously exert more willpower to get anything done, he 
says marijuana should be legalized, even more so than alcohol.  
</P>
<P>
 Legalization is about the only reason Evelyn can fathom for participating in 
the democratic process. "The only reason I want to be a registered voter is so 
I can become an activist to legalize pot," says the senior at Monte Vista High 
in Santa Ana. After rattling off facts, some misquoted, from Herer's ganja 
bible, Evelyn explains her use on a personal level: "That's when I can write my 
best poetry and philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill High junior Simone thinks otherwise. The 17-year-old got stoned once, 
and it only gave her the munchies. 
</P>
<P>
 Simone agrees with Evelyn on the issue of legalization, however, saying that 
alcohol and marijuana induce similar effects. "If they're going to keep alcohol 
legal, then marijuana should be legalized as well, and there should be a 
marijuana age just like there's a drinking age." To Simone, alcohol is a 
greater evil at her school than marijuana because it's more widely used. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even with campus debates on legalization at Foothill High, traditional 
problems with marijuana such as smoking out in the parking lot, going "tweaked" 
to class or selling it on school grounds have been nonexistent according to 
both Simone and her assistant principal, Charles Milligan. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it's the convenience of getting marijuana that keeps it popular, 
Milligan says alcohol is still the drug of choice among high-schoolers. "I'm 
not one with my head in the ground, but I think the problem is pretty much the 
same as it's always been," says Milligan, in reference to the recent study 
showing a rise in use of marijuana among teens. "I think we're a little more 
aware of what to look for than in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps so, but many high-schoolers -- including drug users -- believe the 
rise is connected to drug awareness programs that they say are failures for not 
targeting older kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the first generation brought up on 'Just Say No,' red ribbon (week) and 
other campaigns," Simone says. "What a lot of parents and administrators don't 
realize is that by eighth grade those campaigns are absolutely banal, almost 
demeaning. We want more facts. We don't want little bears or ribbons. If 
anything, the surge is an unconscious rebellion against an authority that 
doesn't have a clue."

ANN CONWAY: COOKING UP SPECIAL MEMORIES; AUTHOR REVEALS RECIPES FOR SCHWAB'S 
SODA, BROWN DERBY SALAD

 "The common denominator is they're all history -- gone, " author Betty Goodwin 
says of the restaurants discussed in her new book, "Hollywood du Jour" (Angel 
City Press). 
</P>
<P>
 She penned the 88-page book, which contains recipes from beloved Hollywood 
eateries such as the Brown Derby, La Rue and Perino's, because she understands 
"there is a direct connection between taste buds and memory," she told guests 
at a recent meeting of Round Table West at the Balboa Bay Club in Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "People can cook this food and re-live the special times they had at those 
restaurants," she said. "They were special occasion spots, the sort of places 
where you celebrated birthdays and anniversaries." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodwin shared the fact that her dad gave her mom an engagement ring over 
lunch at La Rue, the Sunset Boulevard spot that was a haunt of Jack Warner and 
Walt Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 "Later, I came along and was lucky enough to visit a lot of these 
restaurants," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 25 recipes featured in the book, Goodwin has a few favorites. "I love 
the Cobb salad from the Brown Derby. It's so good. And the chicken salad from 
Ma Maison is out of this world." 
</P>
<P>
 She also likes the sauteed chicken with roasted garlic and candied lemon from 
Trump's, an '80s hot spot where "agents and publicists lunched with their 
clients because it was flooded with sunlight and everyone could be seen, but 
tables were spread far enough apart to make eavesdropping difficult," Goodwin 
writes. 
</P>
<P>
 When she cooks up this fragrant dish (which calls for 24 garlic cloves), "I'm 
right back at Trump's," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other restaurants featured in the publication include the Bullock's Wilshire 
Tearoom ("The book's recipe for coconut cream pie was on the menu from 1929 
until the tearoom closed last year , " Goodwin said); the Cocoanut Grove; 
Scandia; Schwab's Pharmacy (with the recipe for its famous chocolate ice cream 
soda); Don the Beachcomber, and the Luau, where, Goodwin writes, "there were 
always plenty of celebrities seated around tables made from lacquered ship 
hatch covers -- from Fred Astaire to the Beach Boys . . . Marlon Brando, Hugh 
Hefner, John Wayne, Norma Shearer, Lee Marvin, Robert Evans and Candice 
Bergen." 
</P>
<P>
 "I save my mother's, grandmothers' and aunts' recipes," Goodwin said. "I 
couldn't bear for these wonderful memories to be lost." 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the program was Paddy Calistro, co-author with Jack Lamb and Jean Penn 
of "Cowboy Love Poetry," and Bonnie Churchill and Robert W. Jensen, authors of 
"The Young Athlete."

 Chinese Opera Preview Party: About 100 guests took home Chinese fortune 
cookies when they attended a recent preview party at the Radisson Park Hotel in 
Irvine for "An Evening of Chinese Opera." 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of fortunes, the cookies were stuffed with facts about the 
performance by Shu Rui Yang and Yu Lin Liu, set for March 20 at the Irvine 
Barclay Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 During the festivities, where Yang (winner of last year's Lincoln Center Asian 
Artist Award) and Liu performed, party organizers explained that the opera, 
actually a sampling of music from "Farewell My Concubine," "Flying Tiger 
General," "The Legend of the White Snake" and "The Wedding," would be 
translated for audience members with the use of surtitles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are anxious for the public to come and see Chinese opera," said Ann Wu, 
chairman pro tem of the opera's presenter, Pan Pacific Performing Arts, Inc. 
"It is beautiful and fascinating -- a great opportunity for people to learn 
about Chinese culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Among guests were Pan Pacific President Amy Kiang; Sarah Mar, special event 
liaison for Pan Pacific; Ruth and Dr. Lock Ding; Rosana Chao (whose daughter, 
Rosalind, was featured in the movie "The Joy Luck Club"); Verna Chou; Julie 
Shen; Beatrice Sun, and Ann and Dr. Ben Wu.

QUOTE ME: OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OC High asks: Is the use of marijuana or other drugs on the increase at your 
school? 
</P>
<P>
 "People no longer try to hide it. Smoking (marijuana) is everywhere . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Michel, 16 
</P>
<P>
 sophomore, Villa Park 
</P>
<P>
 "Most definitely. Going to parties, there has always been alcohol, but 
recently -- in the last two years -- marijuana use has gone up. It seems as if 
kids are starting at an earlier age, which also increases the percentage of 
kids doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Catherine Ganiere, 18 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Corona del Mar 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody smokes pot like they used to. It's actually probably on the decrease. 
Speed is the new trend." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Villegas, 17 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Ocean View 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes. Not a dramatic increase, but it seems that lately I hear of more and 
more people trying it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Cloak, 17 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Calvary Chapel 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think so, at least on my grade level. But I think there is much more 
use in the upper grades." 
</P>
<P>
 Eliza Henry, 14 
</P>
<P>
 freshman, Canyon 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, the use of marijuana is increasing. . . . It is used out in the open, 
and there is nobody there to stop the use and the selling of the substance. 
(Marijuana) is out of control; it is easy to get, it is very cheap, and the 
sellers are everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Christian Lozada, 16 
</P>
<P>
 sophomore, Fountain Valley 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, you can walk around and smell the scent. It stays on your clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosie Manning, 18 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Trabuco Hills 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, and I'm glad, glad I tell you. Marijuana and other drugs should all be 
legal. I'm sad that I live in such a restrictive country where people are not 
free to make their own decisions regarding their own lives. Until people are 
brave enough to break these laws, we are not truly free. At school, there is a 
dramatic increase in the use of drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 (Name withheld) 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 "The use of tobacco seems to be on the rise, but I don't know about 
marijuana." 
</P>
<P>
 Narcis Brasov, 16 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Garden Grove  
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, unfortunately, but kids will be kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Tobi Devito, 17 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe it's on the rise. Pot smoking has always been around in high 
schools, but I think it's crossed over into the mainstream due to its promotion 
by popular music groups. At this current time, it has become a marketing 
device." 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Colet, 18 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Troy 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, marijuana and other drugs are on the increase in certain areas -- it 
depends on the group of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Erin Williams, 16 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I think people at our school are using marijuana and other drugs 
constantly, judging by the way they look and act each day and on the weekends. 
Students tend to influence each other and tell each other about the so-called 
'good feelings' of drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Berkus, 16 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Villa Park 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if it were, how would anyone be able to tell? When people do drugs they 
don't go around saying, 'Heh, I use drugs.' They keep it a secret. You can't 
tell who uses drugs and who doesn't. There is no stereotypical drug user." 
</P>
<P>
 Jennie Gadd, 17 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Troy 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I know more people who are starting to use drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Suttle, 18 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Capistrano Valley 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not aware of any use of marijuana or any other drugs on our campus." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Ingram, 16 
</P>
<P>
 sophomore, Fountain Valley  
</P>
<P>
 "It is increasing. Probably because students believe that drugs aren't as bad 
as they thought they were." 
</P>
<P>
 Don Thomas, 17 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Canyon 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen a lot more people that I know using drugs than I can recall from my 
freshman year." 
</P>
<P>
 Esther Yoon, 16 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Sunny Hills 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know, but the subject of drugs always pops up as a concern, so it 
wouldn't surprise (me) . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 An Le, 17 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Santiago  
</P>
<P>
 "I think so." 
</P>
<P>
 Renee Greco, 18 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Capistrano Valley 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I don't hang around with potheads." 
</P>
<P>
 James McAlevey, 18 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Trabuco Hills 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes. It's not visible, but you know it's out there. And everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Fu, 17 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Marina 
</P>
<P>
 "It's either happening more, or people are being more public with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Melanie Sheldon, 17 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 "(I think) the use of drugs is rising in our school because I hear more people 
bragging about using it, though there's nothing to brag about." 
</P>
<P>
 Krista Scott, 17 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Century 
</P>
<P>
 "More people I know are using it or have at one time. I know it's easy to get 
and not very expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Rodriguez, 17 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Rosary 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, but it is sad to see that these kids have to turn to such a destructive 
drug in order to get a false sense of comfort and security." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey Robyn, 14 
</P>
<P>
 freshman, Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea, but it doesn't really bother me because my friends and I 
don't do it, and that's all that really matters." 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Eurs, 15 
</P>
<P>
 sophomore, Cypress 
</P>
<P>
 "The use of drugs is not on the increase at Los Amigos. I can honestly say our 
school is well aware of drugs and the effects. They might party on the 
weekends, but the act of selling or getting drugs on our school campus is not 
usually an issue to be dealt with. I am not saying no one does drugs (here), 
but it's not something I see as being a problem on the increase." 
</P>
<P>
 Meaalii Tagatauli, 16 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Los Amigos 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes. A lot of people don't, but it definitely is becoming more popular, 
especially in the younger grades." 
</P>
<P>
 Ame Amico, 18 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Calvary Chapel  
</P>
<P>
 "I've been to many other schools that had major drug problems. Los Amigos 
doesn't seem to have a (noticeable) drug problem. What makes a difference is 
that if students are caught using drugs or have possession of drugs, he or she 
will be punished severely." 
</P>
<P>
 Fatima Equza, 15 
</P>
<P>
 sophomore, Los Amigos 
</P>
<P>
 "According to my sources (students and the like), there has actually been a 
decrease of marijuana and other drugs at school." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Main, 17 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 "(I think) more students are using drugs because I've seen a couple of them 
using it. They don't care if you see them or not. They take it for granted (as) 
something that would be natural." 
</P>
<P>
 Alma Elizalde, 18 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Century 
</P>
<P>
 "I would guess that it's a problem, even though it's not out in the open a 
lot. Marijuana is also more practical than other drugs, so most people think 
that it's OK to use it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Corbin, 17 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, marijuana and other drugs are on the increase. The reason is because as 
time goes on, society feels that they have the right to interfere in other 
people's lives. By interfering and trying to stop the problem, they are only 
making it worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Heil 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Cypress

 How do you prepare for a big exam?

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 School spirit lagging? At Villa Park High School, enthusiastic students can 
win Spartan spirit bucks by cheering at assemblies and games, participating in 
spirit competitions, wearing Spartan paraphernalia and taking part in spirit 
weeks, the student newspaper, the Oracle, reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The bucks can be used at periodic auctions for gift certificates, movie 
passes, tapes, videos and food.  
</P>
<P>
 The ASB is encouraged by the results, but reaction has been mixed. "I don't 
think you should have to bribe people to be spirited," said one student. "It's 
kind of sad that we have to reward students for showing spirit, but it's 
working," said another. "There are not enough opportunities to earn spirit 
bucks," complains another.

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; DRUG USE 101; A TEEN'S OWN STORY; THE FOLLOWING 
ACCOUNT IS FROM A 16-YEAR-OLD HONORS STUDENT AT AN ORANGE COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I started doing drugs again this semester. Mostly bud (marijuana) and shrooms 
(psychedelic mushrooms). They started coming my way again at the end of last 
semester, right before finals. It'll probably take me 10 years to figure out 
what happened in the last six months. 
</P>
<P>
 I was a good student until last semester when I got really, really sick of 
school. Before that I was an A and B student. I've taken a lot of honors 
courses -- still take them. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly I party on the weekends. Sometimes during the week -- like last night, 
which was an "honorary weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 I've smoked out the past three weekends. I'm not into it as much as before. 
I'm sort of bored with it. I don't dislike it. It's more like, why not use it? 
It enhances things. I don't mind not fiending on it. It's not anything special. 
I don't care that I do it; it's just something I do. Maybe it's a subconscious 
attempt at suicide. I used to exercise, take good care of myself. I drink lots 
of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently I started smoking cigarettes. I like smoking. It's cheaper than 
smoking cloves. I don't want to live to be 1,001 years old. Seventy years old 
would be OK, but if you ask me in 20 years, my answer might be different. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not very good at focusing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's funny. I used to be involved in "Just Say No" to drugs. I even met Nancy 
Reagan. In seventh grade, a friend smoked me out. He just had it on him. He was 
a family friend, a few years older. He didn't know it was my first time. It 
wasn't a big deal. I got a little high. We probably went to the beach or 
shopping -- I don't remember exactly. At first, I'd use it once every three or 
four months. Starting in ninth grade, my friends and I would use it about three 
out of four weekends. We didn't go to parties; we'd just hang out. We'd think 
like "wouldn't it be funny if we smoked in the parking lot of the Richard Nixon 
Library."  
</P>
<P>
 It was just something we did. It wasn't an issue. Somebody would have it, and 
we'd use it. Most of the time someone had some on them. Most were my same age 
and up. They were school friends and camp friends. 
</P>
<P>
 I would always get it from friends who would buy it or get it from someone's 
back yard. Sometimes we smoke, and sometimes we use it as seasoning -- in 
omelets, cookies, pizza or whatever. 
</P>
<P>
 My camp friends I've known since I was little. At camp I didn't see people 
doing it, but I knew it was around. Now we call it "Camp Sex, Drugs, and Rock 
'n' Roll."  
</P>
<P>
 I don't usually smoke at school but lots do. Off and on it seems like there 
are times when half the school is high. I don't at school because I can get 
annoyed with people and use it as an excuse to yell. So I avoid it. 
</P>
<P>
 I've pretty much quit everything at school. I used to be in debate, some clubs 
and a junior government program. This semester I've been able to budget my 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 I have this kind of general goal to get a Ph.D, but it's not in concrete. Last 
semester sort of wrecked my college plans, though. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm dropping plans to try for an Ivy League school -- maybe I'll get a job and 
go to junior college for a year. I seem to have trouble focusing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My parents are really cool about drugs. They'd say "we would like you to do 
them at home if you're going to do them." 
</P>
<P>
 They thought if they were preachy, I would be rebellious. 
</P>
<P>
 My parents smoke pot and I smoke, but not in front of each other. They like to 
get drunk at night. Sometimes when I come home my mom asks, "Did you smoke out 
tonight?" 
</P>
<P>
 I think she has mixed feelings, though. She told me not to do shrooms. I think 
sometime she had a bad experience on them.  
</P>
<P>
 You have to be very careful where you get them because they can be poisonous. 
I only buy from someone I know.  
</P>
<P>
 We always split what we have between how many people there are. So there might 
be several each or just a stem and a small piece. They make me really happy. 
There's a certain contentment. Everything's in sync. When I come down, all of a 
sudden it's like vacation's over. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes we do acid. But I don't like the idea that it's a chemical. And I 
don't get drunk -- although I really like red wine. 
</P>
<P>
 We go to L.A. a lot, and we go to lots of clubs. I had a fake ID for awhile, 
but I lost it. I don't need it now. It's easy to get in -- I know all the 
doormen. 
</P>
<P>
 I hate being underage. I'd like to move in with one of my friends who lives in 
L.A. I get along with my family, but I want to distance myself from them, be on 
my own.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm not concerned about getting busted. I can find an excuse for every drug I 
do. I don't think I'll ever have enough marijuana on me to be a felony. With 
acid, I'd just say I'm crazy. With shrooms, it would be a spiritual thing or 
whatever. 
</P>
<P>
 I've had bad experiences twice -- both times with bud. Once there was other 
stuff in it. Another time the situation got away from me I was smoking from a 
bong. It's like the smoke got caught in me. I had it in my body too long. I was 
really sketching. I had a really bad problem with focus.  
</P>
<P>
 Last week I hallucinated for the first time. It was like a dream where I was 
awake. I was between asleep and awake, and I stood up and it was like, who 
turned the strobe light on? It was in a controlled situation -- at a party at a 
friend's house, and their parents were gone. I was with people who would help 
me, who wouldn't leave me there, so it was OK. 
</P>
<P>
 Lots of people are doing speed now. It's the new rising drug. It's a habit 
with a lot of my friends. I don't like it though. I got so tired I didn't want 
to move or talk. I have really messed up sleeping anyway. Something I do want 
to try is opium. I think I will try.  
</P>
<P>
 Taking drugs is like smoking or eating sugar. It's kind of a philosophy.  
</P>
<P>
 Today I'm doing all my homework so I can have unrestricted fun this weekend. I 
plan to see lots of friends in L.A., to have a drug-filled weekend. Is drug use 
among high school students on the increase? Yes, according to a survey by the 
National Institute on Drug Abuse. The institute has been tracking the question 
for 19 years. For the past 10 years, the answer had been no. However, in the 
past year, the survey found that the trend has reversed. Across the country, 
50,000 junior and senior high school students were surveyed about the use of 
marijuana and other illegal drugs. Among 10th -- graders, the share using 
marijuana went from 15.2 % in 1992 to 19.2% in 1993. The percentage of 
12th-graders smoking the drug increased from 21.9% to 26% between 1992 and 
1993. The number of seniors who reported using an illegal drug at least once 
increased from 40.7% in 1992 to 42.9 in 1993. The number compares to the peak 
of 65.6% reported in 1981. Has the trend changed in Orange County? In an 
individual account of drug use and in interviews with students on high school 
campuses, OC High looks at the issue.

 Teens have a low rate of keeping follow-up medical appointments, a study at UC 
San Francisco found.Half of those in the study -- 166 people between the ages 
12 and 21 -- failed to keep their follow-up medical appointments. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked during their initial visit why they might fail to keep a scheduled 
appointment, one-third said they might forget, while another third referred to 
being busy. More than half of those interviewed admitted that they would not 
return if the health problem disappeared. In addition, more than two-thirds 
admitted a history of failing to keep previous appointments.

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; MY TURN; EVERYBODY WANTS TO FIT IN, BUT 
ACCEPTANCE BEGINS FROM WITHIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SABRINA FRIEDMAN, Sabrina Friedman is a sophomore at Canyon High School in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a need. It's something you and I crave, even if we don't have it. It's 
something you need as a teen, or even later in life as a leader in the business 
world. Psychologists have proven that if we don't have it, our mental health 
will suffer.  
</P>
<P>
 It's the need for acceptance, the desire to fit in, the craving for belonging. 
It's one of the most basic emotional needs, as powerful, in its own way, as the 
need to eat and sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody wants to fit in. Everybody. We want to be accepted, appreciated, 
liked and loved. Nobody can say they don't care what people think of them and 
honestly mean it. 
</P>
<P>
 That's probably not news to many of us. High school can be a miserable place 
if you feel you don't belong. You can be stereotyped as "different" because of 
the way you look, dress, behave, express yourself, what you eat, your grades 
and even where you live. If you've been labeled in a negative way, you're 
probably doing everything you can to change it. 
</P>
<P>
 But like any need, the craving for acceptance can grow out of proportion. 
Unless you can understand and control this emotional need, it can take over 
your life and cause you to do things that you normally wouldn't do. 
</P>
<P>
 Fear of being different is another aspect of peer pressure. Most of us are 
afraid to be different from our friends because we fear losing those friends. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, some people will judge a person by what he wears. They do now; 
they will in college, on the job and at church. At school, if you're wearing 
the wrong kind of jeans, some group may look down on you. If, as an adult, you 
wear jeans to the office, you may not be accepted either. You may even be fired 
depending on the type of job you have. However, in another job, you could be 
laughed at for wearing a tie. Sometimes these rules are pretty useless. People 
should be judging you by what's on the inside, not what's outside.  
</P>
<P>
 But it can be a problem. What if the people you want to fit in with will only 
let you hang with them if you wear expensive jeans and you can't afford them? 
Or what if the "in" style offends parents and teachers? 
</P>
<P>
 I hear girls in my classes discussing how hopelessly "out" one student is 
because she wore a pair of No! jeans to school. Who are they to criticize? 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to blame it on the "I-have-money-and-you-don't-syndrome," but 
that's too easy. Everyone is subject to criticism on what they wear if every 
part of the ensemble is not considered "in."  
</P>
<P>
 Why? Does it honestly make a difference in the grand scheme of things? With 
some things, it's easier to go ahead and wear what fits in -- such as at work. 
But no one should ever compromise their personal style completely to fit into a 
mold of what's "in." It isn't fair, nor right. Save your efforts for things 
that really matter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that too often we want to be accepted by the wrong people, or 
for the wrong reasons. Or we allow our need for acceptance to lead us into 
behaving in ways that are hurtful.  
</P>
<P>
 What if a group wants you to do something that would compromise your beliefs 
-- such as using drugs? Are you afraid to be different in cases when you should 
be? Do you want to be accepted badly enough to "sell your dreams for small 
desires," as Neil Peart of Rush puts it?  
</P>
<P>
 This need for acceptance can go to extraordinary lengths to satisfy itself. 
Combined with negative peer pressure, it can control you. That's why it's 
important remain in control. Don't let your peers decide who you will be. Don't 
sell your personality to pay the dues for that expensive clique.  
</P>
<P>
 For some, the "in" thing to do is drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 But doing drugs does not make you cool. As a whole, girls and guys who do 
drugs, smoke and drink excessively look less attractive to the opposite sex 
than ones who don't. More than half of drug overdoses are blamed on peer 
pressure. Drugs aren't worth it.  
</P>
<P>
 Some other aspects of peer pressure are pointless, but at least they aren't 
deadly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This need can undermine the morals that anchor you and replace them with empty 
values that will make your life hollow and purposeless. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a simple solution. Learn to love and accept yourself. It's the most 
important thing you'll ever have, and no one can rob that from you. Ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitting in is great, as long as you're fitting in with the right people, for 
the right reasons. But remember, everybody gets hungry. When you're hungry, a 
can of dog food may satisfy you, but that doesn't mean you should eat it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same way, when you want to fit in, make sure it is not in the wrong 
crowd. Stay in control of your need for acceptance. Who you are, and what you 
will be, depend on it.

FIRES, QUAKES PROMPT CHELSEA FLOWER SHOW'S CANCELLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A commercial flower show scheduled for March 18-21 at Mile Square Park in 
Fountain Valley has been called off.  
</P>
<P>
 The Chelsea America Flower Show was canceled Wednesday because exhibitors were 
unable to keep their commitment to participate because of the recent string of 
natural disasters, show promoters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joni Nelson, founder of the show headquartered in New York, said in a 
statement that the cancellation best serves the interests of the public and 
exhibitors, many of whom are in the landscape and commercial nursery business. 
She said the commitment to producing future shows in Southern California is 
unchanged.  
</P>
<P>
 Next month's show was to have been the second in what the organizers hoped 
would become an annual event in Southern California. Flower shows are designed 
to foster an interest in gardening and have been long established in cities 
with short growing seasons, including Seattle, Boston and Philadelphia. They 
typically feature display gardens, new products and seminars. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's Chelsea America show, held in Pacific Palisades, was rained out 
two of the four scheduled days. It had 70 exhibitors and drew an estimated 
20,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it has a similar name, the Chelsea America Flower Show is not 
affiliated with the Chelsea Flower Show in England, produced by the Royal 
Horticultural Society. The society is challenging the use of the Chelsea name 
in U.S. Trademark Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chelsea America organization said Wednesday that scheduled exhibitors in 
the Fountain Valley show were being contacted individually and would be offered 
a refund of any fees paid or the option of applying the money toward 
registration for a 1995 show.

YOUTH PLANNED AMBUSH IN OFFICER'S DEATH, POLICE SAY; VIOLENCE: FRIEND SAYS HE 
TRIED TO TALK TEEN-AGER OUT OF RAMPAGE. 'INSANITY IS FUN,' DEAD YOUTH 
REPORTEDLY SAID. 
</P>

<P>
 When 17-year-old Christopher Golly fatally shot a rookie police officer after 
killing his father, he was carrying out an ambush that he planned and discussed 
the day before, Los Angeles police and a friend of the dead youth said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Just hours before the shooting, the young gunman, a heavy methamphetamine 
user, described his mental state to his best friend. "Insanity is fun," the 
friend quoted him as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 The remark was made during one of several conversations on the afternoon and 
evening preceding the attack in which Golly made "specific threats" that he 
planned to kill his father, Steven Golly, 49, and then wage "a gun battle" with 
officers called to the scene, Police Lt. Daniel Lang said. 
</P>
<P>
 But officers did not know about the threats when they were called about 1:20 
a.m. Tuesday to the Northridge neighborhood where Golly had just shot his 
father to death using a military-style semiautomatic rifle. A gun enthusiast, 
Steven Golly had given the weapon to his son so they could share a common 
interest, according to a family friend. 
</P>
<P>
 As Christopher Golly was gunning down his father, the song "The End" -- in 
which Jim Morrison of the rock group the Doors fantasized about killing his 
father -- was playing on the stereo, said witnesses who were in the house at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in a bloody scene that played out precisely as police say the younger 
Golly had threatened, he opened fire on six officers arriving to investigate a 
report of shots fired inside the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Golly was waiting with an AR-15-type assault rifle behind a block wall, said 
Lang, the officer in charge of the LAPD's Major Crimes Investigations Section. 
</P>
<P>
 Killed in the spray of at least 14 shots was police rookie Christy Lynne 
Hamilton, 45, struck by a shot through an armhole in her bulletproof vest, 
which had been a gift from her mother. She became the second female Los Angeles 
police officer to die in the line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth then retreated to the house and shot himself to death with a 
.22-caliber handgun, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators learned that the teen-ager "had made specific threats that he 
was going to kill a police officer," said Lt. John Dunkin, a police spokesman. 
But he said that police only became aware of the threats after Hamilton was 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
 If police had known about the threats, Dunkin said, "we would have tried to 
locate and talk to him well before this situation." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the last people Christopher Golly talked with was Matt Conner, 18, who 
described himself as Golly's best friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Conner told The Times that he talked with Golly at the Northridge house about 
9 p.m. Monday. "He said he was going to take the assault rifle and shoot (his 
father)," Conner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he (planned) on taking a couple people with him. He wanted to take 
out a cop, and a cop car," Conner said. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Gee, Matt, insanity is fun,' " Conner quoted Golly as saying at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Conner said he persuaded Golly to "promise on our friendship" that he would 
not shoot anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 A message written in black marker pen on Golly's bedroom wall when a reporter 
entered it Wednesday said: "Friends & Butt-head made me do this hah-hah. Tell 
Matt I said, 'Sorry.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Conner volunteered his statements before investigators left the 
shooting scene Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Bever, the live-in girlfriend of Steven Golly, said in an interview that 
Christopher had been particularly depressed since a Feb. 14 marijuana 
conviction that led to suspension of his driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Tuesday morning, the constant throb of the bass from the boy's stereo 
could be clearly heard in the couple's bedroom, Bever said. Then, about 1 a.m., 
the volume increased. She said the song "The End" was playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Golly got out of bed. Bever heard him open his son's door and angrily 
ask what was going on. There was a "pop" sound and a flash of light, she 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it was a gun," Bever said, adding that Steven Golly fell face forward 
onto the floor. He had been shot once. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-year-old then calmly asked Bever, Bever's son Aaron and Aaron's 
girlfriend, Connie McGovern, to leave the house. The three obeyed, and McGovern 
said she took a cordless telephone with her. From outside, McGovern called 911. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Golly fired at least 14 shots at two squad cars, including two at 
Hamilton's cruiser. But they said it was too dark for him to be aiming at any 
particular officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton's mother, Marge Hoffberg, the ex-wife of an LAPD detective, said she 
wanted her daughter to become a teacher rather than a police officer because 
she remembered the 17 years she had spent worrying whether her husband was 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her apprehensions, Hoffberg said she was proud when Hamilton graduated 
from the Police Academy on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "She realized a dream that she had," Hoffberg said. "She did what she had to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffberg said she bought the bulletproof vest because her daughter could not 
afford all the equipment needed for police training. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted her chest protected," Hoffberg said. "I wanted to do something to 
save her life if she ever needed it." 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Golly's business partner and friend of 30 years, Yo Hasegawa, said 
Steven and his son often went target practicing and that the AR-15 was one of 
their favorite weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and Golly family members said the shooting culminated a deterioration 
of the teen-ager's attitude, touched off, they believe, by the death of 
Christopher's mother of a cocaine overdose four years ago. 
</P>

Bell Atlantic Corp. on Wednesday said they have canceled their $33-billion 
merger agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies blamed the deal's collapse on the Federal Communications 
Commission, which this week voted to reduce cable television rates against the 
protests of the cable TV industry. But the complex agreement had run into 
problems long before the FCC decision. 
</P>
<P>
 In the more than four months since the announcement of the deal -- which would 
have been the biggest merger in U.S. history -- Bell Atlantic's stock price had 
plunged more than 20%. The companies also missed three self-imposed deadlines 
for reaching a definitive merger agreement, as they struggled to overcome a 
series of complications. 
</P>
<P>
 Those included TCI Chief Executive John C. Malone's growing reservations about 
the deal, according to well-placed sources. Malone, one of the communications 
industry's most aggressive deal makers, is said to have felt increasingly 
penned in by the Bell Atlantic marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 The failed deal may presage problems for other ambitious, technology-driven 
alliances. The TCI-Bell Atlantic agreement was hailed as a crucial step in 
making the information superhighway a reality, since the marriage would have 
allowed people access to hundreds of cable TV channels and new 
telecommunications services, such as instant home shopping and banking. 
Together, TCI and Bell Atlantic would have reached 40% of all households in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger agreement triggered a massive dash among other cable TV operators 
and regional telephone companies -- historically adversaries -- to join and 
create joint ventures in expectation of what is to become the biggest economic 
boom since the Industrial Revolution. Cox Enterprises and Southwestern Bell 
have already entered into a joint venture. Others are under way. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance also catapulted the normally remote Malone and Raymond Smith, the 
ebullient Bell Atlantic chairman, to center stage in the telecommunications 
revolution. The newlyweds made a habit of appearing together at public events, 
largely as a public relations move. 
</P>
<P>
 Malone, who was to become a major shareholder in Bell Atlantic with stock 
worth well in excess of $1 billion, was going to play a secondary role in the 
newly merged company to Smith, who clearly relished the fame the deal brought 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Atlantic is expected to proceed with its interactive TV experiments, even 
without TCI. The regional telephone company has been a leader among the Baby 
Bells in pursuing technology opportunities beyond traditional telephone 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 TCI is widely expected to continue its pursuit of other partnerships. Malone 
has held discussions with at least three major Hollywood companies -- MCA, Sony 
Pictures and Fox Inc. Malone feels that he needs unrestricted access to 
programming to feed into his cable systems. The collapse of the Bell Atlantic 
deal also raises the possibility that Malone will again team with QVC Network 
Chairman Barry Diller, who recently lost the takeover battle for Paramount 
Communications Inc. Malone was one of Diller's chief backers before the Bell 
Atlantic agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the drama surrounding Wednesday's announcement, TCI and Bell 
Atlantic left open the possibility they will cooperate on joint ventures in the 
future, including the building of high-tech cable/telephone systems and 
investments in programming. 
</P>
<P>
 "This deal is so big and under such a microscope you can't simply put it on 
hold," said one person close to the situation. "If you're going to revisit it, 
you have to make a clean break." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the future for TCI and Bell Atlantic, however, the announcement 
set the stage for a battle royal with Washington. Some observers speculated 
late Wednesday that the decision was actually a high-stakes gambit by the two 
companies to embarrass the Clinton Administration -- which has been an 
enthusiastic proponent of a high-tech cable/telephone infrastructure -- and get 
the FCC to reverse its decision to roll back cable TV rates by 7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Malone is notoriously disdainful of politicians and regulators who have tried 
to rein in the cable industry after years of spiraling rates. TCI vigorously 
attacked the FCC on Wednesday, saying it would cut its capital expenditure 
program by $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said in a statement that the "unsettled regulatory climate made it too 
difficult for the parties to value the future today." The FCC's action as well 
as market "uncertainties," added Malone, propelled the two companies to 
conclude "this is not the time to bring our companies together." 
</P>
<P>
 That charge was forcefully rejected by the FCC. Chairman Reed E. Hundt 
criticized suggestions that the agency's cable rate vote had undercut the 
TCI-Bell Atlantic deal. He said the price cut "did not in any way make the 
future of the cable industry more unsettled." 
</P>
<P>
 James Quello, an FCC commissioner, rejected the notion outright. "I'm afraid 
this is too convenient," he said. "They (Bell Atlantic) may be paying too much 
for it (TCI)." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the deal had run into some well-publicized complications over the last 
several weeks. Although Bell Atlantic's stock price shot up in the wake of the 
announcement, shareholder concerns later caused it to plunge so far that Bell 
Atlantic would have been forced to put up more shares to acquire TCI. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, concerns were raised over the proper value of TCI's assets, 
based on recent regulatory actions. Potentially, the regulations could cut into 
the cash flow from TCI's approximately 13 million cable subscribers. TCI and 
Bell Atlantic executives also were vexed in their efforts to determine how and 
when to acquire TCI's programming interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Those delays were said to have frustrated Malone. "Malone could not get his 
hands on the . . . assets that Bell Atlantic could not take in right away," 
said one industry executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Atlantic officials maintained that all the major issues between the two 
companies had been resolved, and that it had hoped to announce a definitive 
agreement next Monday, following a Bell Atlantic board meeting scheduled for 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the decision to break off the negotiations may actually have a 
beneficial effect on TCI and Liberty Media Corp.'s stock price. Both companies' 
stock prices have been under pressure since the merger was announced four 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 TCI and Bell Atlantic's decision to cancel their deal is not supposed to 
affect a simultaneous deal that TCI has to reacquire Liberty, a company spun 
off to TCI shareholders three years ago that contains many of TCI's investments 
in program services, such as Black Entertainment TV, Home Shopping Network and 
an ambitious new pay TV movie service called Starz! 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the original merger agreement, $25 billion had been assigned 
for TCI and Liberty's cable TV subscribers and $5 billion for programming 
investments, which also includes stakes in Turner Broadcasting System and the 
Discovery Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, $3 billion had been assigned as the value of the so-called "in 
market" cable TV subscribers -- those systems which fell within Bell Atlantic's 
service area that federal regulations would have required the merged company to 
divest. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no cable operator was happy about the rate rollbacks ordered this 
week, several executives in the industry were skeptical that TCI and Bell 
Atlantic would succeed in pinning their failed deal on Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this was the last straw, and on their way out the door, they are 
going to take a shot at Washington," said one cable executive. 
</P>
<P>
 The cable TV industry has taken its licks in recent years, with the credit 
crunch of 1990-1991 putting most deals on hold. After credit eased, the 
industry endured more uncertainty with the congressional drive to regulate 
rates, culminating in the passage of a bill in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 After the FCC announced a sweeping set of guidelines last summer, the National 
Cable Television Assn. predicted that consumers would shave $1.7 billion from 
their $14-billion tab for non-premium cable programming. TCI said at the time 
that it would lose as much as $160 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, TCI spun off its minority interest in more than two dozen cable 
companies to create Liberty Media. Although Malone retained his corporate job 
at TCI, he sold most of his 7% stake in that company and shifted his investment 
to Liberty, where he received stock options as the spun-off company's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberty's stock soon skyrocketed, amid Wall Street enthusiasm for the 
burgeoning cable networks in which Liberty had invested. 
</P>
<P>
 Then last October, TCI and Liberty announced a friendly proposal to merge. If 
the deal goes through, Malone will own about 20% of the reunited companies.

KERRIGAN MOVES TO TOP, WHILE HARDING FALTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While a triumphant Nancy Kerrigan stood at center ice, taking her bows and 
watching bouquets of roses descend from the crowd around her, Tonya Harding 
watched stone-faced from behind the window of a private box inside the Olympic 
Amphitheatre and applauded her rival. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the two U.S. figure skaters could hardly be more different, they have 
shared the same dream. But in that moment, it was clear that both knew that the 
Olympic gold medal remains within the grasp of only one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 After seven weeks of questions about her physical and psychological 
well-being, Kerrigan, 24, of Stoneham, Mass., provided answers Wednesday night 
by skating like a champion. If she does it again Friday night, she will become 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 Skating almost flawlessly to the romantic "Desperate Love," Kerrigan, wearing 
an elegant white dress with black chiffon sleeves, won first-place marks from 
seven of nine judges in the technical program. Harding, wearing a flashy red 
dress, committed one major error and skated unevenly for the remainder of the 
two minutes, 40 seconds she was on the ice to finish in 10th place, virtually 
out of medal contention. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who have been exhausted by the Super Bowl-like hype surrounding the 
women's figure skating competition, Harding's music, however, might have seemed 
the most appropriate. She skated to the score from the movie "Much Ado About 
Nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since Kerrigan was attacked during the national championships in Detroit 
on Jan. 6, and Harding was implicated by her ex-husband and other alleged 
co-conspirators in the plot, their confrontation here has become the most 
anticipated event of the Winter Olympics, obscuring almost all of the other 
1,900 athletes from 66 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them are some outstanding female figure skaters, such as Ukraine's 
Oksana Baiul and France's Surya Bonaly, who are second and third, respectively, 
behind Kerrigan entering Friday night's freestyle program. 
</P>
<P>
 If one of those three women wins that phase of the competition, which accounts 
for two-thirds of the final score, the gold medal will be hers. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the same position they were in after the technical program of the 1993 
World Championships in Prague, Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Baiul, who was 15, became the youngest world champion since Norway's Sonja 
Henie in 1927, and Bonaly finished second after Kerrigan collapsed in the 
freestyle program, dropping to fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan, who began seeing a sports psychologist to help her perform under 
pressure when she returned home from Prague, entered this season with renewed 
confidence, declaring at one point that she should be the favorite for the gold 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
 Her coach, Evy Scotvold, said last week that the attempt in Detroit to derail 
her made her even more determined. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been so confident and ready to do a freestyle program," she said 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 She also said she had been more concerned about her technical program, but she 
performed it with only one noticeable mistake. As she was about to begin a 
spin, she had a bobble that her father, Dan, said was caused by the slight 
weakness in her right knee lingering from the injuries she sustained in the 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
 "Way to go, baby!" Scotvold yelled to her as she completed her routine, which 
received a standing ovation from the capacity crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 On a scale of 6.0, she received two 5.9s, five 5.8s and two 5.6s for required 
elements and four 5.9s, two 5.8s, two 5.7s and a 5.6 for presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 No one scored higher for required elements, and only the extraordinarily 
graceful Baiul, portraying the black swan in "Swan Lake," had better 
presentation marks with six 5.9s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Oksana is exquisite," said 1990 world champion Jill Trenary of the 
United States. "There is no one who can touch her artistically. But Nancy 
looked solid as a rock. There was no question she deserved first." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Wylie, the 1992 silver medalist from the United States, raved about his 
former training partner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nancy did the best anyone could do after seven weeks of people breathing down 
her neck, staring at her, taking pictures of her, asking questions of people 
around her and speculating on what she was having for breakfast," he said. "I 
don't think anyone who can go out there and do that has a fragile psyche." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding, 23, of Portland, Ore., is the one with the reputation for her 
strength under fire, but she appeared unnerved from the moment she stepped onto 
the ice Wednesday night. Because she did not earn a berth in last year's World 
Championships, she was unseeded here and skated two hours before most of the 
other contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other prominent skater in her position was two-time gold-medalist 
Katarina Witt of Germany, returning to serious competition at 28 after six 
years as a professional. Her program did not have the technical difficulty of 
many of the others, but she performed it superbly and is in sixth place. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding skated onto the ice a few minutes after Witt for her warm-up and did 
not land cleanly on any of her jumps. Twenty-four seconds into her performance, 
she landed awkwardly on her most difficult jump, a triple lutz, and could not 
complete the required combination jump, costing her an automatic 0.5-point 
deduction. Two other lesser errors sent her scores plummeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there was speculation that the judges would score Harding unfairly 
because of the bad publicity she has brought to the sport, her presentation 
marks were respectable, ranging from 5.3 to 5.6. But the judges had no choice 
but to penalize her for required elements, scoring her from 4.8 to 5.3. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her skating seemed to tell the world what she's been going through," said 
Trenary.

EXPERTS FIND NEW FLAWS BUT CALL SUBWAY TUNNELS SAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WILLMAN and NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Specialists hired to examine the Los Angeles subway reported Wednesday that 
they found lax enforcement of construction requirements, along with previously 
undiscovered areas of thin concrete, air pockets and missing reinforcing steel 
in the tunnel walls. 
</P>
<P>
 But the engineers who assessed the structures said the tunnels are safe and 
will remain so if the air pockets are filled and leaks of corrosive water are 
sealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin E. White, chief executive officer of the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority, said he will seek to have the contractor whose work was found most 
defective, Tutor-Saliba Corp., perform or pay for the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 White and MTA Chairman Richard Alatorre said they also will try to force 
Parsons-Dillingham, the management firm paid in excess of $170 million to 
oversee subway construction, to share repair costs. 
</P>
<P>
 White said he does not know what the repairs will cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some shortcomings in the construction," White said. "There were 
also some shortcomings in the supervision of that construction (by 
Parsons-Dillingham). But again, the key point is that the tunnel, despite those 
conditions, (is) safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald N. Tutor, president of Tutor-Saliba, said that although he believes his 
company has been unfairly singled out for scrutiny, he would make the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect to look at the report, and wherever these areas of (air voids) 
occur, we'll fix them," Tutor said, adding that deficiencies would be found in 
any structure scrutinized like the 1.8 miles of twin tunnels built by his firm 
between Union Station and Pershing Square. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing a need to review the findings in more detail, the MTA board of 
directors postponed a vote on final approval of a new $45-million construction 
contract for which Tutor-Saliba is the low bidder. 
</P>
<P>
 A Parsons-Dillingham spokeswoman said the firm will try to cooperate with the 
MTA but has not yet agreed to pay for repairs. "We're willing to sit down with 
them and figure out what we can do," Debra Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another representative of Parsons, Ray W. Judson, said in a statement that the 
firm has "put into place an entire new management team" that is doing a better 
job on the construction of new segments of the Red Line subway. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports unveiled Wednesday were prepared by two separate groups hired in 
September in response to an article in The Times reporting that numerous 
sections of the concrete subway tunnels were built thinner than the 
design-specified thickness of 12 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 One group of two engineers and a former tunnel company executive examined the 
physical soundness of the tunnels and produced a 45-page report. The second 
group, a New Jersey-based law firm that specializes in engineering matters, 
examined the performance of Parsons-Dillingham in overseeing construction and 
managing costs of the $1.45-billion subway, including the handling of contract 
amendments called change orders. The firm found that the shortcomings of 
Parsons-Dillingham were extensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Concrete was placed in some instances without inspector approval," the 
engineering law firm, Barba Arkon International Inc., said in a 49-page report. 
"(We) also identified significant deviations from (Parsons-Dillingham's) 
written procedures relative to stop work notices, change order analysis, 
project scheduling requirements and quality assurance/quality control 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 "These deviations from written procedures are at variance with what is 
considered acceptable industry practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Evans M. Barba, chairman of the law firm, said his investigation found that 
the worst problems occurred in Parsons-Dillingham's management of the 
construction between Union Station and Pershing Square. Barba, whose firm was 
paid $150,000, identified seven categories of "substantial deviations" from 
contract specifications. 
</P>
<P>
 The law firm was generally more pointed in its conclusions than was the 
separate panel of three experts hired to review the soundness of the tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel and its team of consultants, who were paid a total of $1.25 million, 
identified at least 350 linear feet of previously undiscovered thin concrete 
and air voids in the crown areas of the tunnels between Union Station and 
Pershing Square. The panel recommended that the voids, located between the 
concrete and a plastic membrane designed to keep the tunnel dry and gas-free, 
be filled with injections of grout. The voids, ranging in width to six feet and 
in length to 20 feet, are serving as conduits for water that has been leaking 
into the tops of the tunnels, the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
 After conducting tests, the panel concluded that the new areas of concrete 
thinness -- along with areas of missing reinforcing steel -- are of no 
structural significance. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract specifications called for 12 inches of concrete, and officials 
have required contractors to place extra rods of reinforcing steel in areas 
where thickness dips below 10 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 The tunnel panel found that Tutor-Saliba had not placed extra reinforcing 
steel in the areas of newly discovered thin concrete. The experts also 
determined that workers had severed the rods of steel at certain construction 
joints, contrary to design plans that called for continuous steel reinforcing. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the panel members said tunnel walls that are at least six inches -- 
with no rods of reinforcing steel -- are adequate. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel was made up of Edward J. Cording, an engineering professor at the 
University of Illinois; John M. Hanson, a retired executive and professor of 
engineering at North Carolina State University, and Paul De Marco, a retired 
tunnel company executive from New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Hanson and Cording said they were unconcerned about missing 
reinforcing steel because they concluded that the steel served no role in 
providing structural strength. That conclusion drew immediate reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm flabbergasted," said Michael L. Shank, whose Colorado-based company built 
the subway tunnels between Pershing Square and MacArthur Park. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his firm was required in all instances to place extra steel in any 
area of thin concrete. "We were just saps," Shank added. "All I can say is, 
they held us to a different standard." 
</P>
<P>
 John F. Hall, a professor at Caltech who specializes in earthquake 
engineering, said he, too, was surprised. "We don't just put steel in tunnels 
to make ourselves feel good," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that the panel's report acknowledged that the reinforcing steel was 
required at the time of construction, partly "to provide bending capacity for 
ground loads." 
</P>
<P>
 James Pott, an engineer and former board member of the MTA's rail construction 
subsidiary, said the tunnel panel's conclusion that the structures would be 
adequate with six inches of concrete, with no steel rebar, is a "complete 
override of everything that's been designed. Why bother with these construction 
requirements?" 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to calling for repair of air voids and water leaks, the panel said 
that: 
</P>
<P>
 * Because "grouting records are not available," the MTA should determine the 
extent of other voids between the plastic membrane and the surrounding earth 
and fill them. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Northridge earthquake widened some tunnel cracks, and transit officials 
should consider repairs to "prevent further separation of cracks" that would 
allow pieces of concrete to crumble onto the tracks from the entrances to 
utility rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some water leaking into the tunnel is highly corrosive, and it should be 
monitored "with the aim of detecting changes in conditions at an early stage 
and grouting or making (other) repairs." 
</P>
<P>
 * MTA officials should examine a defective concrete wall along tracks outside 
the Civic Center station to "determine whether additional work needs to be 
done." 
</P>
<P>
 Board members of the MTA were divided Wednesday in their responses to the 
reports. The findings allayed the fears of some, but heightened the concerns of 
others. Some officials said the reports proved that the MTA must exercise far 
more diligent oversight of its multibillion-dollar projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you pay for a system you pay for it to be delivered in operating, Class 
A condition -- not with deficiencies," said county Supervisor Mike Antonovich. 
"It's the equivalent of buying a new car and finding (that) the engine, the 
tires and the transmission go out when you drive it off the showroom floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Councilman Evan Anderson Braude said: "It confirms my feeling that 
the tunnel is safe." Subway Tunnel Inspection 
</P>
<P>
 A panel of experts concluded Tuesday that some tunnel walls in the Los Angeles 
subway were built thinner than designed but are structurally sound. The panel 
also found the Red Line subway was built with some voids between the concrete 
tunnel liner and a plastic membrane that surrounds the tunnel. The gaps are up 
to six feet wide, 20 feet long, and 33 3/4 inches deep. The experts recommend 
repair of 18 gaps between Pershing Square and Union Station.

KREMLIN SPY SUSPECT ELUDED CIA SAFEGUARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW and ROBIN WRIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aldrich Hazen Ames passed CIA polygraph tests in 1986 and 1991, even though he 
was allegedly on Moscow's payroll at the time and actively working to 
compromise U.S. intelligence agents and operations, officials disclosed 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 During the same period, according to sources, he successfully deflected the 
CIA's curiosity about how he could afford a lifestyle far more lavish than his 
federal salary could support by saying that his Colombian-born wife had family 
wealth -- an assertion that apparently went unchecked for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 These revelations and others go to the heart of the central puzzle of what 
officials now concede may be one of the most disastrous breaches of security in 
U.S. history: How could an intelligence officer with access to some of the 
nation's most sensitive information -- including the names of CIA sources 
inside the former Soviet Union and details of their operations there -- have 
eluded detection for years, even though his conduct and lifestyle seemed to cry 
out for examination? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer, as pieced together from government sources and others familiar 
with the CIA, seems to lie in a combination of bureaucratic shortcomings and -- 
at least at the beginning -- an overreaction to a period in the CIA's history 
when its internal counterintelligence unit went to such extremes in its search 
for possible traitors that careers were blighted and reputations were stained 
on mere suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Ames' lifestyle and conduct were apparently more restrained during his 
early years as a Russian mole than they became toward the end, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Intelligence specialists were quick to note that there is no perfect system 
for ferreting out leaks. "It will happen again because you can't devise a 
foolproof system," said Roy Godson, a counterintelligence specialist at 
Georgetown University. "No one in the history of the world has developed a 
perfect system." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there was near-universal agreement among the experts that the Ames case 
raises profound questions about the adequacy of the CIA's system. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem seems to have been misplaced confidence in the polygraph. 
One source said Ames had dismissed lie detectors as unreliable -- and he may 
have proved it. 
</P>
<P>
 "They rely on the polygraph too much," said Stansfield Turner, director of the 
CIA during the Jimmy Carter Administration. "It's a fallible instrument. People 
can be trained to beat the polygraph, and they do." 
</P>
<P>
 Vince Cannistraro, a former CIA counterterrorism official, said a series of 
Cuban double agents (recruited by the United States as agents, but actually 
under the control of the Cuban intelligence service) managed to pass polygraph 
examinations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was in the mid-1980s, and it was a terrible embarrassment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, although CIA procedures call for regular re-examination of officers, 
such tests are heavily backlogged. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts said another significant part of the problem can be traced back 
more than 20 years to the time when a controversial CIA officer named James J. 
Angleton presided over the agency's counterspy program. 
</P>
<P>
 Angleton was a fanatic on the subject of security, and he became convinced -- 
to the point of obsession, according to critics -- that a Soviet mole existed 
within the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 His extreme methods and convoluted theories about KGB penetration became so 
controversial within the agency that he was forced to retire in December, 1974, 
by then-CIA Director William E. Colby. 
</P>
<P>
 That was a decade or more before Ames began working for the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
 But inside the CIA, former officials and other sources said, the reaction 
against what were seen as the abuses of the Angleton era caused a swing away 
from aggressive counterintelligence activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Angleton so ruined counterintelligence that it's never been the same," Turner 
said. "He built such a paranoia that people have realized that 
counterintelligence did some terrible things in the past, and that makes them 
gun-shy about what they do today." 
</P>
<P>
 Some knowledgeable sources, including Robert M. Gates, CIA director in the 
George Bush Administration, said the agency recognized the problem and moved to 
correct it in recent years. Indeed, they said, tightening and improving the 
system contributed to the discovery of the alleged betrayals by Ames and his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
 The CIA's screening methods begin with polygraph examinations and background 
investigations of all employees when they join the agency, an official said. 
Every five years, a new investigation is conducted, including the polygraph. 
But only the recent five-year period is covered, rather than re-examining the 
employee's entire life. 
</P>
<P>
 And it appears that, at least until fairly recently, these examinations did 
not always probe deeply into the financial backgrounds and lifestyles of agency 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence 
Committee, said his committee wants to find out why Ames did not become a 
suspect until 1991 -- six years after he allegedly began spying for the Soviets 
and receiving payments that eventually exceeded $1.5 million, according to an 
FBI affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
 'There's clearly something very wrong here, and we should review it," 
DeConcini said. 
</P>
<P>
 When CIA investigators first raised questions about Ames' finances, "his cover 
was that his wife was from a wealthy family," DeConcini said. "If it had been 
up to me, I would not have been satisfied with that answer." 
</P>
<P>
 DeConcini contended that none of the recommendations of a special panel 
appointed by his predecessors to improve national security provisions had been 
put into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Those recommendations, issued in 1990 and incorporated in proposed 
legislation, failed to attract strong support after the Berlin Wall came down 
and espionage fears diminished, a congressional intelligence source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames not only drove a Jaguar while ostensibly living on a government salary of 
about $68,000 a year but paid cash for a half-million-dollar home and ran up 
more than $450,000 in credit card bills over a period of several years, 
according to government allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 However, sources familiar with the Ames case said it was his spending and 
banking of large sums of money that led investigators to single him out of a 
larger group of CIA employees who had access to secrets that they feared had 
been sold to the Soviets and later to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've narrowed it down to 10 or 15, and one of them has this financial 
situation, it's an eye-opener," said Skip Brandon, who retired last month as 
acting assistant director of the FBI's intelligence division. "The financial 
picture was an important part of this investigation. It really was." 
</P>
<P>
 According to an FBI affidavit made public Tuesday, Ames, and his wife, Maria 
Del Rosario Casas Ames, who was also charged with espionage conspiracy, 
deposited $1,538,685 in their Virginia bank accounts between 1985 and this 
month, none of it derived from CIA salary checks. 
</P>
<P>
 From April, 1985, through last November, Ames' take-home salary totaled 
$336,164, but he and his wife spent four times that amount -- at least 
$1,397,300, FBI Agent Leslie G. Wiser Jr. said in the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
 Cannistraro said that about two years ago, a KGB defector helped spark the 
investigation that eventually led to Ames when the defector told investigators 
that the agency had been penetrated.

COLUMN ONE; DIGGING UP BLASTS FROM THE PAST; IN CALIFORNIA, MORE VICTORS -- AND 
VICTIMS -- ARE FEELING THE EFFECTS OF 'OPPOSITION RESEARCH.' THE GOVERNOR'S 
RACE WILL SHOWCASE THE POWER OF PROBING CANDIDATES' POLITICAL AND PRIVATE 
LIVES.

<P>
 In baseball, it's scouting. In war, it's spying . In politics, it's called 
opposition research. You will not hear much about it from candidates 
themselves, but the California gubernatorial race promises to be a showcase for 
the age-old practice of digging into the public -- and private -- lives of 
political rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask Darry Sragow, who is running state Insurance Commissioner John 
Garamendi's campaign for governor. Sragow is collecting "everything I can find 
out" about Treasurer Kathleen Brown, whom Garamendi faces in the June 7 
Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the motto of the Scouts," Sragow said. "Be prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi is in good company. After years of lagging behind Republican 
research efforts, the state Democratic Party has amassed a database on Gov. 
Pete Wilson so his opponents can, in one party official's words, "move quickly 
when a weakness appears." 
</P>
<P>
 This month, when Brown asked fellow candidates to join her in pledging to run 
a "no-negative" gubernatorial race, she did not mention that her campaign had 
already spent thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours delving into her 
opponents' vulnerable spots. Her political gumshoe: Ace Smith, whose clients 
have included a presidential hopeful named Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's camp has built a fat file on Garamendi and an even fatter one on 
Brown -- an effort made easier by the fact that Joseph D. Rodota, who did 
opposition research on Brown during her 1990 bid for treasurer, is now Wilson's 
Cabinet secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 In one form or another, opposition research has been part of the rough and 
tumble nature of democracy since the first election. Today, rapidly improving 
campaign techniques and communications technology have made research more 
crucial than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign professionals say that to stay competitive they must start research 
earlier, be able to access it more quickly and package it in a dizzying array 
of sophisticated formats, from a television sound bite to an "attack 
facsimile." 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll be accused of malfeasance if you don't do opposition research," said 
Allan Hoffenblum, a Los Angeles-based Republican consultant. "It's part of the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 Campaigns, it is said by those who run them, are won or lost in the library. 
Information is power, and when that power is unleashed in a focused way the 
results can be devastating. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent contender whose dreams were dashed by an opponent who did his 
homework: Orange County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, whose front-running bid 
for Congress in 1988 was derailed after the college degree she listed in her 
campaign literature was found to be nonexistent. And who can forget former 
television commentator Bruce Herschensohn, whose 1992 U.S. Senate bid ended on 
a sour note after a Democratic Party official revealed that the Republican had 
visited a nude dance club? 
</P>
<P>
 Among opposition research specialists, almost everyone agrees on the craft's 
basic tenets: Start early. Be accurate. Investigate your own candidate as 
painstakingly as you do their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Most professional researchers distance themselves from the kind of 
dirt-digging that was used against Herschensohn. Their preferred hunting ground 
is the vast and varied public record -- resumes and campaign finance reports, 
committee votes and newspaper clippings. Their quarry: flip-flops and 
contradictions, unkept promises and outright lies. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it comes to the nitty-gritty of political snooping -- What 
information is relevant? Is anything off limits? -- there are no hard and fast 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very slippery area," said one campaign official. Another political 
veteran, asked to draw the line between what is scrupulous and what is sleazy, 
said bravely: "It depends." 
</P>
<P>
 "So much in politics is situational ethics. It's right or wrong, good or evil 
depending on whose ox is being gored," Hoffenblum said. "A negative campaign is 
when they're talking about you. A truthful campaign is when you're talking 
about them." 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition research was used to powerful effect during the last gubernatorial 
race when Wilson, then a U.S. senator, faced former San Francisco Mayor Dianne 
Feinstein. Insiders still talk about the summer of 1990, when Wilson's 
information gathering team, in the words of one begrudging Democrat, 
"neutralized their biggest negative right off the bat." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein was on the attack, airing a television ad that skewered Wilson for 
accepting thousands of supposedly tainted dollars in contributions from the 
savings and loan industry. Coming at a time when then-U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston's 
ties to the S & L industry were front-page news, the ad could have caused major 
damage. Instead, Wilson's team used research to turn a vulnerable point into a 
non-issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately, his camp aired an ad that accused Feinstein's husband, Dick Blum, 
of owning an interest in a failed S & L in Oregon. Feinstein fought back, 
accusing Wilson of telling the "big lie" and noting that Blum's interest 
amounted to 0.25% of the thrift's assets. But the mission was accomplished: the 
S & L issue -- what some had seen as Wilson's Achilles' heel -- was a soft spot 
Feinstein could no longer afford to poke. 
</P>
<P>
 The man behind this coup, Rodota, has since closed his Sacramento-based 
opposition research firm, Benchmark Research. Campaign staffers insist that his 
role in Wilson's Administration prevents him from playing anything but an 
advisory role in their research efforts. But he may always be known by the 
nickname his colleagues gave him during the 1990 race: "Dr. Death." 
</P>
<P>
 When then-Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley ran for governor in 1982, rival George 
Deukmejian's campaign was alarmed to discover that Bradley had significant 
support in the San Joaquin Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going nuts -- there was no way Bradley was going to be a friend of 
farmers," said Ken Khachigian, a Republican political consultant and a close 
Deukmejian adviser. So Khachigian started digging, searching for something -- 
anything -- to prove his point. 
</P>
<P>
 He found it in a newspaper clipping: In 1973, Bradley had nominated United 
Farm Workers founder Cesar Chavez for the Nobel Peace Prize. "In the ag' 
community, that was death," Khachigian recalls happily. And what made the 
discovery even sweeter was that the tidbit made a perfect one-liner. 
(Khachigian's rule of thumb: "If you can't reduce it to a 3-by-5 index card, 
something's wrong.") 
</P>
<P>
 "If you liked Jerry Brown, you'll love Tom Bradley," began the index card that 
Khachigian distributed to farmers throughout the state. The card mentioned 
Bradley's nomination of Chavez and added this footnote: "Cesar Chavez (has) 
said that California's growers are 'bad people.' He added: 'I hate them.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The card's flip side described Deukmejian as "an advocate, supporter and 
friend of California agriculture." 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide and nationally, Republicans have long had the upper hand in the 
cutthroat research wars. The Republican National Committee's opposition 
research unit, created by the late committee Chairman Lee Atwater, is credited 
with helping to demolish then-Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis during his 
presidential bid in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the weapons that research wrought: Willie Horton, a felon who murdered 
a man and raped his companion while on furlough from a Massachusetts prison. In 
television ads that described Horton's misdeeds, George Bush's campaign 
portrayed Dukakis as being soft on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1992 presidential election, however, Clinton's advisers helped the 
Democrats make up lost ground. And California's Democratic Party got busy too. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, after the primary we would say: 'Oh, let's do research.'. . . We 
were weak and everybody knew it. But now it's a whole new ballgame," said Bob 
Mulholland, who was political director of the state Democratic Party when the 
approach to information gathering underwent a sea change beginning in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the chairmanship of Phil Angelides and now Bill Press, the party set out 
to get the goods on Republicans that could make a difference on Election Day. 
The 1994 governor's race will be the most important test of that new system, 
and the party is taking its anti-Wilson effort very seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Employing up to 10 people at a time to pull court records and hunt down 
committee votes, the party has collected piles of data, "triaged" it to 
determine what is usable and organized it via computer to make it instantly 
accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have moved the party into the 21st Century," executive director Susan 
Kennedy said. Already, that effort has begun to pay off, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, after Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders suggested that legalizing 
drugs deserves study, Wilson called for her resignation. Within 15 minutes, the 
state Democratic Party was sending out attack faxes with "proof" of what 
Kennedy calls the governor's "blatant hypocrisy." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970, when he was an assemblyman, Wilson introduced and carried legislation 
that required police, in certain situations, to release arrested people who 
were under the influence of drugs. Moreover, Wilson in 1968 co-authored a 
measure that reduced the first possession of marijuana from a felony to a 
misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The object is to be able to respond or launch something in the same news 
cycle," Kennedy said. Failure to pounce on an opponent's weakness -- or, worse, 
failure to respond to a rival's attack -- "is the kind of thing that can 
destroy a candidacy. You have to be able to defend yourself without delay." 
</P>
<P>
 That, Brown campaign staffers say, is precisely the reason the 48-year-old 
Democrat is assembling opposition research -- despite what they describe as her 
sincere desire to run a positive campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to do it," said Michael Reese, Brown's campaign spokesman. "They have 
it. We need it. We must at least be prepared for the coming battle because we 
don't know what tactics are going to be used, what weapons will come into play. 
Foolish would be the candidate who didn't prepare . . . for this war." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the only major gubernatorial candidate who insists he is doing no 
opposition research is state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), who has raised 
the least money and says he does not expect to win. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to shoring up her defenses, Brown has begun a little informational 
target practice as well. This month, an item appeared in a San Francisco 
newspaper's political column under the headline, "Garamendi Flip-Flop." It 
noted that while Garamendi told a Los Angeles radio station he had believed in 
the death penalty "for all of my life," he had opposed capital punishment early 
in his political career. 
</P>
<P>
 Sragow, Garamendi's campaign manager, conceded the error. But he was quick to 
note that although Brown was not identified as the source of the tidbit, he saw 
her fingerprints all over it: "Kathleen Brown's people love to talk about 
things that happened back when people were wearing leisure suits." 
</P>
<P>
 Reese, Brown's spokesman, acknowledges that they planted the story. "Part of 
opposition research is knowing what's out there and being able to point 
reporters in the right direction," he said. Indeed, the leaking of hot tips to 
the media is a common campaign technique, although reporters do not always 
bite. 
</P>
<P>
 As eager as some campaigns are to leak the fruits of their research, they are 
often reluctant to talk about the process itself. When asked to describe 
Brown's effort, Reese was initially terse: "Yes, we do opposition research. 
That's it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Schnur, Wilson's campaign spokesman, first greeted inquiries about 
Wilson's research effort with a stab at deadpan humor. "We have no need for 
opposition research because we intend to run on Pete Wilson's record," he said, 
adding a moment later: "I thought I'd give (that answer) a try." 
</P>
<P>
 The topic that really makes political professionals wary is private 
investigators. Most campaigns, fearing the stigma that a cloak-and-dagger, 
garbage-sifting private eye might bring to their candidate, say they do not 
hire sleuths -- although a few acknowledge that they know of others who do. 
However, Harry F. Block, a Newport Beach private detective, says "it happens 
all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've done governors in different states and more than one political figure 
here in Southern California," said Block, who added that he is often asked to 
look for undeclared gifts, misappropriated government funds and, the latest 
hot-button issue, instances of sexual harassment. Not that he always knows 
exactly whom he's working for. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, they don't want to be 'in it.' So you get your money and your 
instructions somewhere else. But when you get into it, you know damn well who's 
behind it," he said, recalling one assignment he got from a lawyer in San Jose. 
"He gave me my instructions. . . . But what does a lawyer in San Jose care 
about an Illinois senator?" 
</P>
<P>
 Block said he is not involved in the California governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaigns never use every fact they gather. Sometimes the information they 
have in reserve is deemed too sensitive or irrelevant. Certain topics -- 
particularly ones dealing with a candidate's sexual proclivities -- are 
difficult to raise gracefully. Many a tawdry detail has been junk-piled for 
fear of a campaign backfire. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why Herschensohn's eleventh-hour embarrassment has been so 
controversial. Four days after the Republican was confronted with a huge 
photograph of the Seventh Veil, a nude dance club he later admitted he had 
visited, Barbara Boxer was elected to the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Mulholland, the Democratic official who waved the photo in Herschensohn's face 
at a campaign stop in Chico, said that issue was relevant because Herschensohn 
had made family values a foundation of his campaign. But others tried to 
distance themselves from Mulholland's activities, and today Mulholland tries to 
draw a distinction between opposition research and the dirt he dug up about 
Herschensohn -- an investigation he characterizes as "a total sidebar to 
research." 
</P>
<P>
 "Research is public policy stuff. . . . People's personal lives should remain 
personal and most of what I call 'the beyond the public record stuff' should 
not be used," he said. "But when (a Republican) gets up there and starts 
preaching to me, they better be careful." 
</P>
<P>
 Khachigian, who was Herschensohn's campaign manager, calls this "the faulty 
logic of hit men and toadies." Boxer and top Democratic party officials can say 
they knew nothing about Mulholland's stunt, Khachigian said, but he is not 
buying it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having participated in this little rancid episode, Angelides, Mulholland, 
Barbara Boxer and all the rest have to pay the penalty," Khachigian said. 
"Forever more I get to attach (the words) 'sleaze and smear' to what they did." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, aggrieved candidates get to do more than that. Former Los Angeles 
County Assessor Alexander Pope will never forget the morning in 1978 when his 
opponent, a tax agent named Frank Hill (no relation to the state senator), held 
a news conference accusing him of resisting arrest in a Sacramento bar. Within 
hours, an embarrassed and apologetic Hill was back before the cameras. Closer 
inspection of police files had shown that Alexendera Pope -- a 27-year-old 
woman -- was the culprit. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had waited until (five days) before the election. . . . They just 
figured there was no way I could respond," Pope said. But respond he did. After 
Pope won the election, he sued Hill for libel and won. When Hill paid up, Pope 
donated the $15,000 judgment to the League of Women Voters. Researching the 
Opposition 
</P>
<P>
 For months, researchers have been sorting through voting histories, court 
records, political fund-raising and campaign literature in search of 
discrepancies, flip-flops and errors. The Times asked several political 
consultants -- not employed in this year's governor's race -- what they would 
look for in the backgrounds of the major contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson -- Lots to analyze in Wilson's decades of public service as a 
state legislator, San Diego mayor and U.S. senator, but what he has done -- and 
not done -- as governor will be the meat and potatoes of the research effort. 
Of particular interest is anything inconsistent with Wilson's current stands on 
hot-button issues such as crime and illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi -- Like Wilson, Garamendi has a lengthy 
public record beginning with his 1974 election to the Assembly. Opponents will 
pore over Garamendi's record as the first elected insurance commissioner as 
well as his unsuccessful 1982 run for governor. Republican researchers will 
scrutinize Garamendi's lengthy legislative record looking in particular for 
liberal votes. 
</P>
<P>
 State Treasurer Kathleen Brown -- Brown's shorter history of public service 
will force researchers to rely more than usual on newspaper clippings and 
correspondence. Brown's five years on the Los Angeles Unified School Board will 
be analyzed because education is central to her campaign. Her four years as 
state treasurer will also be scrutinized, as will her substantial fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Tom Hayden -- Opponents are unlikely to spend a lot of effort 
researching Hayden. "His life story is an open book," said one insider, 
referring to Hayden's history of civil rights and anti-war activism and his 
former marriage to actress Jane Fonda. Hayden's many years in Sacramento and in 
politics also could provide campaign fodder, particularly anything at odds with 
his reform agenda.

ANALYST PREDICTS $6-BILLION DEFICIT FOR WILSON BUDGET; STATE: OVERESTIMATION OF 
REVENUES, 'RISKY' RELIANCE ON FEDERAL AID ARE FAULTED. ADMINISTRATION DEFENDS 
FIGURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL JACOBS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Painting a bleak financial picture for state government, the nonpartisan 
legislative analyst said Wednesday that California faces a $6.1-billion budget 
deficit next year. 
</P>
<P>
 And the outlook does not improve the following year, when analyst Elizabeth G. 
Hill is predicting an additional $4.1 billion in red ink under current spending 
and tax policies. 
</P>
<P>
 In a critical review of Gov. Pete Wilson's budget proposal, Hill said the 
state will end the current spending year with a $2.5-billion deficit and can 
expect another $2.4-billion shortfall next year. In addition, Hill said the 
Administration is being overly optimistic about the state's recovery from 
recession and said revenues could fall $1.2 billion short of Wilson's 
forecasts. This would bring the total deficit to $6.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's budget offers a variety of proposals to deal with most, but not all, 
of that budget gap. However, Hill and her staff say that the state cannot count 
on the success of those efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Wilson's reliance on the federal government to help rescue the 
state with $3.1 billion in added revenue is "a highly risky strategy that could 
result in a multibillion-dollar budget hole," she said. Those funds were not 
included in the federal budget package that President Clinton sent to Congress 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's budget also assumes that the U.S. Supreme Court will rule in 
the state's favor in a court challenge to the state's method of taxing 
multinational corporations. A victory in that case would bring the state an 
additional $600 million in revenue, which Wilson has counted on in his budget 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor has proposed a variety of reductions in state programs, including 
sharp cuts in welfare grants and elimination of a variety of benefits in the 
Medi-Cal program. But even if the Legislature were to enact the changes and if 
the governor gets the added federal support he is seeking, his budget would 
still come up short because it overestimates tax revenues, according to Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilson Administration defended the governor's $55.4-billion spending plan 
for the 1994-95 budget year that begins July 1. That budget proposal calls on 
the federal government to pay a larger share of the state's health and welfare 
programs and to pick up the entire cost of education and other required 
services for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be irresponsible for the state to issue some sort of forgiveness to 
the federal government that we do not expect (it) to pay for the costs of 
federally mandated programs, especially in a time when we are in financial 
difficulty," said H.D. Palmer, a spokesman for the state Department of Finance. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer said that his boss, state finance director Russell S. Gould, was 
meeting with White House officials Wednesday, along with representatives of 
other states, to make the case for increased federal spending in states with 
large numbers of undocumented immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer said the Administration's revenue forecasts, which predict that 
unemployment will bottom out this year, were conservative and in line with most 
economists. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislative analyst's office review of the governor's budget proposal is 
an annual event -- a key step in the building of a spending plan that in theory 
must be adopted before the new fiscal year begins. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an election year, with the Republican governor bracing for a tough 
campaign, the two-inch-thick document provides ammunition for his Democratic 
challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Year after year, Wilson has been "overly optimistic about the revenues and not 
being realistic about his budget proposals," said Michael Reese, spokesman for 
Treasurer Kathleen Brown's campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown agrees with Wilson that the state "is not getting its fair share" from 
the federal government, Reese said. "She thinks California should fight tooth 
and nail to get every penny it deserves. But there is a fundamental 
responsibility to be realistic in crafting a budget." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has not yet described her own state spending plan. But Reese said that 
in past years she has endorsed what he called "belts and suspenders" -- 
automatic expenditure cuts if revenues fall short of expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Democratic candidate, Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, has also 
been critical of the governor's budgeting. "There was a flaw in the first set 
of numbers that Wilson submitted," said Darry Sragow, Garamendi's campaign 
manager. "It's time to cut up the state's credit cards and learn the obvious 
lesson from the '80s: We have to pay as we go along," Sragow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, like Brown, still has no specific plan to reduce the looming 
deficit. That will come later in the campaign, Sragow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Analyst Hill believes that to fund schools at current levels, the state may be 
forced to loan money to school districts -- recovering the money when the 
economy takes a turn for the better. But her report noted that a similar scheme 
to pay for public school funding was struck down recently in the state courts. 
</P>
<P>
 To provide more money for public education, Hill's report calls for changes in 
law to give voters in local districts the ability to raise property taxes for 
schools. To do that would likely require a change in Proposition 13, the 
popular initiative that sharply limited property taxes. Efforts to make major 
changes in that landmark measure have failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill did not offer a set of recommendations to erase the potential deficit.

LEGISLATORS PARDON YELTSIN OPPONENTS; RUSSIA: THE 253-67 VOTE DECLARES AMNESTY 
FOR ALLEGED COUP PLOTTERS AND THOSE CHARGED IN BATTLE FOR PARLIAMENT. REFORMIST 
DEPUTY CALLS MEASURE 'BEGINNING OF CIVIL WAR.'

<P>
 In a stunning challenge to Boris N. Yeltsin, lawmakers voted Wednesday to 
pardon all of the Russian president's foes who face charges for their roles in 
political violence, from the 1991 coup attempt to last October's battle for the 
Moscow White House. 
</P>
<P>
 The Duma, the lower house of Parliament, voted 253 to 67 to declare amnesty 
for all the alleged traitors after its Communist chairman, Ivan Rybkin, argued 
that doing so would be a step toward "civic peace and harmony." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's allies saw the amnesty instead as a move toward disaster, what 
reformist Deputy Sergei Yushenkov called "the beginning of civil war in 
Russia." A presidential spokesman condemned it as "a dangerous path that 
contradicts the national interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Rowdy opposition rallies in Moscow marking the Russian holiday that honors the 
military provided a taste of what may lie ahead, with about 10,000 protesters 
near the Kremlin calling for Yeltsin's ouster. When told of the amnesty, the 
crowd cried thunderously, "Hurrah!" 
</P>
<P>
 The broad pardon set the stage ominously for Yeltsin's State of the Nation 
address today to the new Russian Parliament, which came into being under a new 
constitution last month after Yeltsin dissolved the old Parliament in September 
because it blocked his reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Communist-nationalist coalition that supported the amnesty holds and 
all the opposition leaders do go free, Russia appears doomed again to the cycle 
of endless political battles that Yeltsin tried to break in September at an 
ultimate cost of more than 140 lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's spokesman, Vyacheslav V. Kostikov, said the amnesty is "a challenge 
to Russian democracy" and a sign that the Duma learned nothing from the old 
Supreme Soviet, which Yeltsin ended up getting rid of with tanks and troops in 
October after it defied his order to dissolve. But Kostikov did not indicate 
whether Yeltsin will oppose the amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing the president can do to legally reverse the decision," said 
Sergei A. Pashin, one of Yeltsin's top legal advisers. The Duma has a clear 
right under the new constitution to issue amnesties, and the decision is not 
subject to a presidential veto because it is not a new law but simply a 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Journalists and some relatives began a vigil Wednesday afternoon outside 
Lefortovo prison, waiting for the release of former Vice President Alexander V. 
Rutskoi, former Parliament Chairman Ruslan I. Khasbulatov and others jailed 
after the October clashes. 
</P>
<P>
 The aging accused plotters of the 1991 coup attempt against Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev, who was then president of the Soviet Union, have been living at home 
as their trial has dragged on month after month. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate sign of when the Lefortovo prisoners would be released. 
Some Yeltsin aides predicted that although the Russian president cannot stop 
the amnesty, he can put it off by waging a legal battle claiming that pardons 
cannot be issued to people who have not been convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, expect the release at Lefortovo to come today, when Russian 
prosecutors get the official papers needed from the Duma. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of the return to the streets and podiums of such 
deputies-turned-rebels as Ilya V. Konstantinov, the bellicose leader of the 
banned National Salvation Front, was a daunting one indeed for the Yeltsin 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "People like Ilya Konstantinov are untamable," said Leonid Smirnyagin, a 
presidential adviser. "They do not submit to the logic of history and will 
again try to reunite the irreconcilable opposition under their banner." 
</P>
<P>
 At the opposition rally in front of the Bolshoi Theater, however, protesters 
exulted at the likelihood that their fight against Yeltsin will resume with 
full force. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will mean a revival of the movement for Russia's liberation from 
Yeltsin's capitalist puppet regime," said Tatyana Shevchuk, a 57-year-old 
retired biology teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "This serves the ultimate purpose of getting rid of the president," said 
Andrei Bondarev, 27. "We do not need American valets as Russian president. The 
Russian people need a true Russian president, and we have one: Alexander 
Rutskoi!" 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the danger of freeing opposition agitators, Duma deputies said they 
had voted for the amnesty because they believed it was time to do whatever it 
took to create the national unity needed to straighten out the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives us a chance to start movement in the direction of harmony," said 
Sergei M. Shakhrai, a former member of Yeltsin's government. "Russia has a 
chance now, and so do its main political forces." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Duma vote, only the most pro-Yeltsin faction, Russia's Choice, appeared 
to have opposed the amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
 Extremist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democrats, Communists and several 
moderate factions supported it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Duma thus lived up to all the gloomy predictions that it would, in 
essence, be no better than the Supreme Soviet that Yeltsin dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin can only hope that his powers under the new constitution are great 
enough to allow him to shrug off the constant resistance from lawmakers that 
led him to dissolve the last Parliament. He can also hope that enough has 
changed so that Rutskoi, Khasbulatov and others will find it hard to re-enter 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the time that those guilty in the tragic events of Oct. 3-4 were in 
prison, a new statehood has been created in Russia, in which Rutskoi, 
Khasbulatov and others have no part," Smirnyagin said. 
</P>
<P>
 That new statehood, however, has drawbacks for Yeltsin as well. Before 
December elections brought Russia its new constitution, he could bend the law 
and justify it by claiming he was more legitimate than Russia's patched-up old 
constitution because he had been elected by the people. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, he would seem to be stuck with the system of power he helped to 
create. 
</P>
<P>
 The Duma's amnesty provides the first real test of whether Yeltsin plans to 
abide by the new division of powers or to try once again to ignore it and claim 
presidential rights -- such as, perhaps, the right to block an amnesty -- that 
the constitution does not actually give him.

DANNEMEYER TO MAKE 2ND BID FOR SENATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Orange County congressman William E. Dannemeyer, a champion of the 
religious right and an outspoken opponent of homosexuals, announced Wednesday 
that he will make his second consecutive bid to be the Republican nominee for 
the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer complained that the only other major Republican candidate in the 
race -- Rep. Michael Huffington (R-Santa Barbara) -- is so indistinguishable 
from the Democratic politics of Sen. Dianne Feinstein that he gives voters 
little reason to vote the incumbent out of office. 
</P>
<P>
 The former seven-term congressman said that his anti-abortion, anti-tax and 
anti-homosexual posture offers a clear contrast with both leading candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Conservative Democrats have a reason to vote Republican when we define a 
distinct difference with our liberal opponents," Dannemeyer said at a news 
conference Wednesday in the state Capitol. "We're the party that wants to lower 
taxes, not raise them; restrain spending and provide for growth and job 
creation." 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer, 64, promised a vigorous campaign against Huffington. But GOP 
leaders said Wednesday that unless the Fullerton Republican can raise 
substantial funds, his role may be limited to that of a protest vote. 
Huffington is a wealthy freshman legislator who has said he will spend millions 
of dollars of his own money to finance his Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on his fund raising in the past, he hasn't demonstrated an ability to 
finance a (statewide) campaign," said Sal Russo, a Republican political 
consultant in Sacramento. "Unless he is able to raise more than he has, I don't 
see him being much of a factor." 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer played a similar role when he challenged former Sen. John Seymour 
in the 1992 GOP primary. By Election Day, Dannemeyer never expanded his support 
beyond a conservative base and he lost the primary nearly 2 to 1. Seymour went 
on to lose the general election to Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer said this race is different because he is not running against an 
incumbent who had the support of Republican leaders in Sacramento and 
Washington. And he promised to raise about $2.5 million by the June 7 primary. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Dannemeyer has not filed any financial records for his 1994 Senate 
race, which he is required to do if he raises or spends more than $5,000 on the 
campaign. Federal records also show that he has a debt of more than $100,000 
remaining in his 1992 Senate campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington so far appears to be all but dismissing Dannemeyer's campaign as a 
nuisance, aiming his strategy at a November showdown with Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see that I have a primary," said Huffington, who is already broadcasting 
television commercials statewide. "But I also know that if I want to focus on 
beating Feinstein, I better focus on beating Feinstein. So I speak to all of 
these groups about Feinstein. That's who I am going for." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Huffington and Dannemeyer, the GOP primary ballot will include 
Riverside businesswoman Kate Squires. So far, there are no major Democratic 
challengers to Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 The three GOP candidates will meet in a forum this weekend at the state 
Republican convention in Burlingame, where Dannemeyer promised to confront 
Huffington in front of the party's rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, 44, has emphasized an anti-tax and fiscally conservative platform, 
but he and Dannemeyer are vastly different candidates on social issues. In 
contrast to Dannemeyer, Huffington supports a woman's right to abortion, the 
right of homosexuals to serve in the military and restrictions on guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer has begun criticizing Huffington as a carpetbagger for seeking a 
California office. Until recently, Huffington was an executive in the family's 
Houston oil company. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need to define him as a Texan," Dannemeyer said. "Texas is a wonderful 
state, but I don't think they should have three U.S. Senators." 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer entered politics 31 years ago as a Democratic state assemblyman 
from Fullerton. He switched to the Republican Party four years later and was 
elected to the first of seven terms in Congress in 1979. He retired from the 
House in 1992 in order to run for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 As a congressman, Dannemeyer developed a reputation as a conservative crusader 
against homosexuals and a proponent of a controversial AIDS law that involved 
disclosure and quarantine. He also gained attention and outraged Washington by 
reading graphic descriptions of homosexual sex acts into the Congressional 
Record. 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer said homosexuality is a symptom of the nation's separation from its 
religious roots. For his 1994 campaign, he applied the same concern to a number 
of other problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement on crime, Dannemeyer traced problems back to a 1947 U.S. 
Supreme Court decision that "inserted into our law the myth of separation of 
church and state." He said the lack of religion in public institutions and 
government support for the welfare state have led to the nation's crime 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wonder no longer where gang culture and crime increase comes from -- we 
created it ourselves," he said. "Stated another way, Congress produced it as a 
byproduct of the War on Poverty and the U.S. Supreme Court stole our 
Judeo-Christian heritage."

U.S. PROPOSES CUTTING TIMBER SALES 10% MORE TO SAVE OWLS; ENVIRONMENT: 
ADMINISTRATION DOUBLES ESTIMATES OF JOB LOSSES IN THE NORTHWEST IN A REVISION 
OF COMPROMISE REACHED LAST SUMMER. PLAN GOES TO JUDGE NEXT MONTH. 
</P>

<P>
 In a final report on its plan to protect the endangered spotted owl, the 
Clinton Administration on Wednesday proposed reducing sales of timber from the 
Northwest's forests by a further 10% and almost doubled its estimates of jobs 
that will be lost as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 In a final environmental impact statement, the Administration said it will 
propose further limits on logging alongside stream banks on federal lands -- a 
move cheered by environmentalists. But in a provision they oppose, the plan 
also would relax logging restrictions in California's national forests by 
allowing more frequent timber harvests. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan -- a slightly revised version of a compromise forged by President 
Clinton in July -- will go to U.S. District Judge William Dwyer next month. 
Dwyer ruled in 1991 that because the government had not made adequate 
arrangements to protect the endangered owl, logging had to stop throughout the 
8.6-million-acre range of federal lands west of the Cascade Range. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the plan still could change before its final submission to Dwyer. 
But after that submission on April 1, the plan automatically will take effect 
and sales of new logging tracts in the economically troubled region can begin 
legally for the first time in three years. However, several environmental 
groups have warned that they may file new lawsuits that could bring the renewed 
sales to another abrupt halt. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials argued that the plan released Wednesday will 
stand up against challenges in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "The changes made really strengthen the plan," said George T. Frampton Jr., 
assistant secretary of the Interior for fish, wildlife and parks. "It does not 
save all the old-growth forest, nor does it produce the kind of timber harvest 
level the President and secretary (of the Interior Bruce Babbitt) thought 
they'd get. But it's right down the middle, scientifically credible, fair and 
legally sound. And it's on the cutting edge of ecosystem management." 
</P>
<P>
 Frampton added that he would "love to go into court personally and argue for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan unveiled Wednesday is the final step in an Administration effort to 
arbitrate a seven-year war of wills between environmentalists and loggers in 
the Northwest. At stake have been the habitats of nearly 1,000 threatened 
species, as well as the jobs of thousands of timber industry workers. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the politically sensitive changes reflected in the report, the 
Administration revised its estimates of direct job losses attributable to the 
plan to 11,000. In July, Clinton had said that about 6,000 loggers probably 
would join unemployment rolls because of proposed restrictions on logging. But 
he promised about $1.2 billion for retraining and economic stimulus programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Polsky, spokesman in Washington for the American Forest and Paper Assn., 
said the revised plan "means fewer jobs and more economic hardship in that 
region. It's going to take more money to make this plan work. And they didn't 
have enough money to make the plan work to begin with." 
</P>
<P>
 Frampton said the revised plan would strengthen protections not only for the 
spotted owl but for many other species whose survival has been jeopardized by 
aggressive logging. Although timber harvests on federal lands in the Northwest 
reached nearly 2 billion board feet per year throughout the 1980s, the Clinton 
Administration has proposed limiting logging in such areas to 1.1 billion board 
feet per year for the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The key change -- added protection for riverbanks -- would prohibit logging 
within 100 yards of small streams, rather than 50 yards, as had been proposed 
earlier. That provision, Frampton said, would reduce erosion and enhance the 
habitats of such threatened fish as trout and salmon. It also would place 
roughly 160 million board feet of timber off limits to loggers. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10,000 board feet are needed to build a typical single-family home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased they are doing more to protect streams," said Rep. Elizabeth 
Furse (D-Ore.). "We have to protect a $1-billion fishery." 
</P>
<P>
 Many environmentalists cried foul at a change that would allow the sale of 
logging tracts in California national forests after as little as 110 years of 
regrowth. An earlier provision said that forests must grow back for at least 
180 years before they could be subject to further harvesting. In the Shasta and 
Trinity national forests and Mendocino National Forest, harvesting could resume 
after 110 years of regrowth under the new plan. In the Klamath National Forest, 
the waiting period would be 140 years, and second harvests would have to wait 
180 years in the Six Rivers National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 With some of those expiration dates drawing near, the change would make 
roughly 60 million board feet of lumber available for harvest, and it was 
welcomed by the California Resources Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very positive step forward because it will provide more timber jobs 
for California at a time when communities that rely on the forests for a living 
are suffering dire economic consequences from the harvest reductions," said 
Douglas P. Wheeler, the state's secretary for resources. "The timber harvest 
increase allowed in the plan is not great, but it's an improvement over the 
draft," he said.

SAN JOAQUIN FARMERS PROTEST PLANNED WATER CUTBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK ARAX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The federal government came to the richest farm county in the nation Wednesday 
and got an earful from farmers, fieldworkers and tractor salesmen about the 
delta smelt and the economic ruin they say could befall this heartland if the 
fish gets water once set aside for crops. 
</P>
<P>
 How the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency decides to reapportion the water 
from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta -- a key link in the state's supply as 
well as a vital nursery for fish and wildlife -- is one of the most important 
economic and environmental issues facing California. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes before Wednesday's hearing on the proposed new allocations, hundreds 
of farmers and fruit pickers paraded down the streets of Fresno, shouting "No 
water, no food!" and "Without water, we will perish!" A caravan of tractors and 
trucks loaded with oranges rumbled from City Hall to the hearing room at a 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Once inside, they wasted no time telling representatives from the EPA and U.S. 
Department of Fish and Wildlife about the plan to deed at least 800,000 
acre-feet of water from farms for the smelt and other threatened fish and 
wildlife species. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Nilmeier, a fourth generation grape and fruit grower, strode up to the 
podium wearing a cowboy hat and suspenders and an angry stare. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take my hat off to you today not out of respect for what you're doing but 
so you can see my face and remember it," Nilmeier said. " 'Cause you're talking 
about taking away our jobs and our way of life to save some fish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well look at our faces. We're endangered species too. The family farmer." 
</P>
<P>
 For 15 years, California officials have struggled with how to reconcile saving 
one of the state's most valuable natural resources -- the huge estuary that 
reaches from San Francisco almost to Sacramento -- with the desire to keep the 
tap running to cities and farms. 
</P>
<P>
 But the state refused to act and the federal government, facing a lawsuit by 
16 environmental groups, stepped in last year to propose water quality 
standards that would alter the equation between farms, cities and wildlife. The 
goal is to reduce the estuary's high salt levels by leaving more fresh water in 
the delta certain times of the year to hold back saltwater intrusion from San 
Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 In normal snowpack years, the 800,000 acre-feet held back from San Joaquin 
Valley farms might not be a problem, farmers say. But in drought years, farmers 
say they would have no guarantee of enough water to stay in business. 
</P>
<P>
 "You people don't understand the effect of what you're proposing," said David 
Daniel, a produce packer from Mendota, an impoverished valley town where 
officials predict massive layoffs if the plan goes into effect as written. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can you retrain a 45-year-old farm worker like myself. What kind of money 
will it take to teach people like me another way of life?" 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists point out that there are two kinds of farming in this valley 
-- the sustainable crops grown along California 99 and eastward and the 
subsidized cotton and alfalfa grown on weak, salty land on the westside. The 
farms most affected by the proposed changes, they say, are the less viable 
westside operations. 
</P>
<P>
 But eastside farmers say they too use federal water from the delta and would 
have to fallow good land if the proposed allocations go into effect. Farmers on 
the westside dispute the EPA's estimated economic loss to the area of $20 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you take 400,000 acres of farmland out of production, which these 
proposals will do, you're talking about an economic loss of $400 million," said 
Lawrence Turnquist, president of the board of directors of the Westlands Water 
District.

COLLEGE ACCREDITATION PANEL ADOPTS PLAN ON DIVERSITY 
</P>

<P>
 Brushing aside objections from prestigious California universities, the 
association responsible for accreditation Wednesday adopted a controversial 
diversity statement that encourages institutions of higher education to promote 
multiculturalism on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting in San Francisco, 15 commissioners of the Western Assn. of Schools and 
Colleges unanimously approved a "statement on diversity" that requires 
four-year colleges and for-profit trade schools in California, Hawaii and Guam 
to examine their progress on multiculturalism during accreditation reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-page statement has drawn the ire of Stanford University President 
Gerhard Casper, USC President Steven B. Sample and a number of private college 
presidents who argue that the new diversity guidelines are too vague and an 
intrusion on academic freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 The college presidents contend that the statement could allow outsiders to 
dictate how schools should teach students about racial harmony and cultural 
sensitivity. They also said it portends a dramatic turn in the field of college 
accreditation, where accrediting agencies have concerned themselves with 
minimal standards. 
</P>
<P>
 But Donald R. Gerth, president of Cal State Sacramento, who chaired the 
meeting Wednesday, said commissioners adopted the diversity statement because 
"there is widespread support for this among the leadership of the colleges and 
universities in this region." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerth said the statement is "not a new standard," but a clarification of a 
1988 diversity guideline that was already in the accreditation handbook. The 
1988 policy said that appreciation of diversity should be an "outcome of 
undergraduate education," and the new statement suggests ways this can be 
accomplished -- including extending college curricula beyond traditional 
Western values. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerth said the statement was intended to give "direction or purpose" to 
schools looking at their efforts to promote multiculturalism and fears that it 
would be used as a hard-and-fast standard were "speculative." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have absolutely no intention as a commission for these various ghosts to 
appear," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accreditation controversy has been one of the most hotly debated recent 
subjects in academia, and by the time the statement came to a vote Wednesday it 
had gone through several revisions. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 92 institutions with 433,000 full-time students went on record as 
supporting the new statement, while 14 schools with slightly fewer than 59,000 
students -- among them Pepperdine and smaller religious institutions such as 
Thomas Aquinas College in Santa Paula -- were in opposition. Five schools wrote 
to the association but took no position. 
</P>
<P>
 During almost two hours of discussion Wednesday, 19 speakers testified about 
the statement. Representatives from Stanford and Thomas Aquinas continued to 
voice opposition, while speakers from the California Maritime Academy in 
Vallejo, the state's Postsecondary Education Commission and the University of 
Judaism in Los Angeles urged commissioners to adopt the measure, said Gerth and 
other association employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we took seriously everything that was said," Gerth said. "The members 
of the commission on the whole feel that what we are doing is sensible and 
reasonable. We listened to the comments and we proceeded." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerth said the statement will be included in the criteria used to evaluate 
schools in the accreditation process. 
</P>
<P>
 A Stanford spokesman late Wednesday said Casper, one of the top academics 
opposed to the statement, would have no comment.

BOSNIA CROATS REJECT PLAN TO LINK UP WITH MUSLIMS; BALKANS: THE ABRUPT 
TURNABOUT IS A SETBACK FOR U.S. PLANS FOR A NEGOTIATED PEACE. THE TWO SIDES DO 
AGREE TO HALT FIGHTING.

 Leaders of Bosnia-Herzegovina's Croatian minority have abruptly rejected a 
U.S.-brokered proposal for political union with Bosnia's Muslims, dealing a 
setback to the Clinton Administration's plans for a negotiated peace in the 
divided republic, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Croatian and Muslim military leaders agreed to halt the fighting 
between their forces in Mostar and other central Bosnian towns, giving U.S. 
diplomats hope that political talks can get back on track. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of a new republic that would join Bosnia's Muslims and its Roman 
Catholic Croats has become the center of U.S. negotiating efforts in the former 
Yugoslav republic, and the Croats' rejection of the idea left U.S. diplomats 
scrambling. 
</P>
<P>
 The diplomatic flurry reflected a new reality in the Bosnian imbroglio: After 
months of standing on the sidelines, the United States has suddenly replaced 
Europe as the main broker for any peace deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher strongly endorsed the proposed 
Muslim-Croatian combination, telling the Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
that the idea has "many, many advantages." 
</P>
<P>
 "If they could get together, it would make for a more viable state," 
Christopher said, adding that it would also make the job of international 
peacekeepers -- including U.S. troops, if and when they are deployed to enforce 
a peace accord -- much easier. "I don't know whether that will happen, but it 
is certainly part of the peace initiative that we want to promote with as much 
encouragement as we can," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 An earlier, European-designed peace plan would have divided Bosnia into three 
provinces -- one for each of the country's main ethnic-religious groups -- the 
Muslims, the Croats and the Eastern Orthodox Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime minister of the Muslim-led Bosnian government, Haris Silajdzic, said 
that he is bitter about the Bosnian Croats' sudden turnabout and charged that 
they are being manipulated by both neighboring Croatia and Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 "They agreed and they backed away, probably because there was a consultation 
(by Croatia) with Belgrade," the Serbian and Yugoslav capital, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been talking to them for months" to prevent the division of Bosnia in 
three parts, "but we are not able to convince them," he said. "Frankly, I do 
not know where we go from here." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said Charles E. Redman, the State Department's special 
negotiator for Bosnia, is trying to persuade the Croats to return to talks. 
</P>
<P>
 One senior official, sending a pointed message to Croatia, said the United 
States could seek U.N. economic sanctions against Zagreb if it obstructs a 
solution in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. Security Council is already considering sanctions against Croatia 
because the republic has sent more than 5,000 troops into Bosnia to reinforce 
Bosnian Croat forces there. 
</P>
<P>
 The military truce was signed at the U.N. peacekeeping force base at Zagreb's 
airport by Rasim Delic, the Bosnian government's military commander, and Ante 
Roso, chief of the Bosnian Croat military forces. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the cease-fire, the two forces agreed to position U.N. 
peacekeepers in sensitive areas, withdraw artillery from front-line areas and 
establish a joint truce-monitoring commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muslim-led Bosnian government and the Bosnian Croats fought as allies when 
Serbian-backed forces rebelled against the Sarajevo government in April, 1992, 
but they later began fighting over land that their two communities shared. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher told the Senate committee that he still opposes the idea that this 
week's success in forcing a withdrawal of artillery around Sarajevo should be 
followed by similar operations in other towns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would emphasize that each of the safe areas in Bosnia is quite distinctive 
and quite different and you cannot put a template down on them and have one 
technique be useful in other areas," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he added that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is moving ahead 
with plans to stop Serbian rebel shelling of the airport at Tuzla in 
northeastern Bosnia and to move new peacekeeping troops to the Serbian-besieged 
town of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO agreed to undertake those missions at its meeting in Brussels last month.

U.N. BOSNIA AID PROGRAM 'INADEQUATE,' STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Its humanitarian operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina has long been the United 
Nations' pride. But a prestigious group of policy analysts scrutinized the 
program and Wednesday pronounced it crippled by international politics and 
"inadequate in the face of the immense catastrophe." 
</P>
<P>
 In a long report, the analysts, while granting the United Nations was caught 
in a no-win situation, concluded it "did not manage very well." The analysts 
were sponsored by Brown University's Watson Institute for International Studies 
and the Refugee Policy Group of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Minear, the six-member team's leader, told a news conference that U.N. 
agencies had no overall plan for operating in Bosnia and "did not know how to 
act in a war." 
</P>
<P>
 The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the key agency in 
humanitarian relief, should have acted sooner to help people flee "ethnic 
cleansing," he said. And the agency failed to mount adequate social services 
such as rape counseling, despite "the use of mass rape as a strategy of war," 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Minear and his team, which interviewed scores of U.N. officials and other aid 
workers in the former Yugoslav federation, acknowledged that the U.N. operation 
"succeeded in reaching a substantial number of those in desperate situations, 
keeping people alive and easing their suffering." 
</P>
<P>
 The report made it clear that one critical problem was not the United Nations' 
fault: Many governments embraced the humanitarian program as a "fig leaf" and 
"alibi" to hide or excuse their failure to do anything to stop the war. Maria 
Bellacque-Bellar, a private French relief worker, told the team: "People look 
at us as if to say, 'We know you're feeding us to compensate for the fact that 
your governments won't act.' "

CHRISTOPHER TIES HAITI SANCTIONS TO ARISTIDE OK OF COALITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher, underlining a growing friction between 
the Clinton Administration and ousted Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, 
said Wednesday that the United States will not seek new economic sanctions 
against Haiti's military rulers unless Aristide agrees to name a coalition 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that it would be 
pointless to tighten the embargo against Haiti until Aristide accepts a 
practical political plan to restore democracy to the impoverished Caribbean 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Administration has been trying for more than a week to persuade 
Aristide to endorse a coalition government plan advanced by a group of Haitian 
politicians, Christopher was the first official to link the plan to new 
economic sanctions. Previously, Administration spokesmen had said that 
Washington would impose the sanctions regardless of whether Aristide endorsed 
the compromise proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats from the United States, France, Canada and Venezuela have been 
discussing a draft of a sanctions resolution with members of the U.N. Security 
Council for weeks. The four countries agreed in December to seek stronger 
sanctions if the military government of Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras did not step 
aside to permit Aristide to regain the office he lost in a bloody coup in 
September, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 But Christopher said Wednesday that the United States is wary of tougher 
sanctions because they would increase suffering in the Western Hemisphere's 
poorest country. 
</P>
<P>
 His remarks seemed to plunge relations between the Administration and Aristide 
to a new low. U.S. officials are becoming increasingly impatient with what they 
consider Aristide's inflexibility. For his part, Aristide, the only freely 
elected president in Haiti's history, is said to believe that the 
Administration has lost interest in helping him regain his lost office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that sanctions can add a good deal of pressure," Christopher said. 
"We think that they are most effective, though, when they are moving toward 
some political result. At the present time . . . there is no plan that we can 
be promoting effectively with the sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher said that the coalition government plan, advanced by eight Haitian 
parliamentarians whom he called a "developing centrist group," offers the best 
chance of restoring democracy to Haiti. The plan calls for Aristide to name a 
new prime minister who could form a coalition civilian government to clear the 
way for Aristide's eventual return to office. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide flatly rejected the proposal, saying it contains no guarantee that he 
would ever be able to return to power. Aristide's camp is also concerned that 
the plan would require him to share power with a prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide and Cedras signed an agreement last summer on Governors Island in New 
York Harbor that was supposed to restore the ousted president by Oct. 30. 
However, the military leaders refused to keep their promise to step down. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide's Washington lawyer, former Rep. Michael Barnes (D-Md.), said that 
the proposal advanced by the parliamentarians "is much weaker than what was 
agreed to at Governors Island." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes called on the Security Council to vote for new sanctions to force the 
army to keep the agreements it made at Governors Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) said the Administration's new policy places 
too much reliance on the goodwill of the military leaders who staged the coup. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me we are putting pressure on the wrong party here," Dodd told 
Christopher. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Aristide announced plans to address international human rights 
conferences in Paris on Sunday and in Geneva on Wednesday in an effort to 
generate new pressure on the military regime. 
</P>
<P>
 At the United Nations, a spokesman said that Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali, trying to break the impasse, has invited Aristide to New York, 
presumably to discuss the parliamentarians' plan.

THREAT OF VIOLENCE CIRCLES SARAJEVO DESPITE CALM; BOSNIA: MORTAR BLAST SHATTERS 
ILLUSION OF PEACE. HEAVY WEAPONS ARE STILL BEING FOUND NEAR CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A mortar blast, a surge in machine-gun fire, a thwarted aid delivery and U.N. 
discovery of dozens more heavy weapons in Serbian-held territory made clear 
Wednesday that the siege of Sarajevo has not really ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the capital remains calm in comparison with the unbridled bombardment 
of the last 22 months, U.N. officials are finding it more difficult each day to 
pass off the NATO ultimatum for ending the strangulation of this city as a 
resounding success. 
</P>
<P>
 A mortar that detonated on the city's eastern outskirts overnight was too 
close to the confrontation line between Bosnian government and Serbian rebel 
forces to determine which side had fired it, said Lt. Col. Bill Aikman, 
spokesman for the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials have been assuring the international community since NATO's 
Monday deadline for surrender or withdrawal of all heavy artillery from a 
12-mile zone around Sarajevo that a sophisticated French radar system in place 
here could precisely locate any weapon firing on the capital in violation of a 
cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 But Aikman said the explosion was too distant from the radar system located at 
the eastern extreme of the city, making it impossible to determine the source 
and fix a target for retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. troops likewise claimed that they could not pinpoint the source of heavy 
artillery fire on a convoy of Swedish peacekeepers near the northeastern city 
of Tuzla on Tuesday, in which five soldiers were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 North Atlantic Treaty Organization flyovers were ordered, but no return fire 
was authorized by U.N. officials at mission headquarters in Zagreb, Croatia, 
despite a reported request from the besieged peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman said the source of the fire could not be determined. But the chief of 
staff of the Nordic battalion that was targeted in the attack, Lt. Col. Alf 
Gorsjo, told news agency reporters in Tuzla that the fire came from 
Serbian-held territory. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most telling indications that NATO's Feb. 9 edict for liberating 
Sarajevo has evaporated amid U.N. objections to Western military intervention 
was the refusal by French peacekeepers to allow an aid official to cross the 
U.N.-patrolled siege line. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sarajevo director of the International Rescue Committee, John Fawcett, had 
obtained the support of the U.N. commander in Bosnia, British Lt. Gen. Michael 
Rose, for a first attempt to deliver humanitarian relief goods directly from 
central Sarajevo to the Serbian-held Grbavica neighborhood a few hundred yards 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the siege, Serbian rebels had forced all relief supplies to run a 
gantlet of armed checkpoints that began at the far eastern extreme of the city. 
Rebel gunmen routinely delayed convoys, demanding authorizations from Serbian 
nationalist leaders in the rebel stronghold of Pale, and extorted parts of the 
cargoes as the price for passage. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the NATO ultimatum for ending the siege, U.N. troops have taken 
over patrols of the front lines between Serbian-held and government-held 
sectors. Rose has said these patrols should lead to free movement in and out of 
the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gen. Rose said as far as he was concerned, the roads are open and we should 
start using them ASAP," Fawcett said, noting he had a written directive from 
the U.N. commander to that effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, French troops standing watch on the Bridge of Brotherhood and 
Unity connecting central Sarajevo with Grbavica halted Fawcett, who was 
traveling with one other aid colleague and a truckload of boots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried and we got stopped by UNPROFOR. I guess the policy just hasn't 
filtered down to some levels," Fawcett said, adding that his agency will try 
again today to deliver its relief goods. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. troops may have barred the agency's passage on the assumption that 
Serbian rebels manning a checkpoint just beyond the bridge would turn the 
convoy back, as they continue to resist outside efforts to restore free 
movement in the capital they have trapped. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials here also appear to be backing away from a March 7 date for 
opening Tuzla airport for relief supplies that was set by the U.N. chief of 
peacekeeping operations, Kofi Annan. More than 750,000 people are in desperate 
need of aid in the Tuzla region, which is cut off from road convoys by Serbian 
rebels to the north, west and east and has been blocked by Muslim-Croatian 
fighting along the only access route from the south. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has refused to agree to humanitarian 
relief flights into Tuzla, claiming the effort could funnel weapons to the 
mostly Muslim population there. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Bosnian Serb military official has threatened to fire on any foreign 
plane landing at Tuzla over Serbian objections. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at our resources and capabilities," Aikman said of the March 7 
date for starting a Tuzla airlift. "That is a proposal rather than a firm 
date." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. spokesman also conceded that despite earlier assurances that the 
Serbs had complied with the NATO deadline for withdrawing or surrendering heavy 
weapons, "a surprising amount of stuff has been left in every imaginable 
location around the countryside." 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman said 121 suspicious sites had been identified by NATO air and U.N. 
ground inspections since the deadline elapsed. Although most of those were 
determined to be vacant, at least 32 sites were found to have combat-ready 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. troops are being assigned to each site.

 President Clinton's federal budget for 1995 proposes no big tax hikes other 
than a 75-cent cigarette tax increase to help finance health care reform. But 
tucked within its pages are several dozen new or increased "user fees and other 
collections" that would raise a combined total of $1.5 billion next year. Here 
are a few of the new revenue-raisers that Clinton is asking Congress to 
approve, and the amount of money they would generate in 1995:

 * Food and Drug Administration fees, including new levies authorized by the 
Prescription Drug User Fee Act and Mammography Quality Standards Act: $338 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. Department of Agriculture fees for overtime inspections of meat and 
poultry plants: $103 
</P>
<P>

catastrophic crop insurance: $40 
</P>
<P>
 * New 15% surcharge on judgments for debt collected by the Justice Department: 
$39 
</P>
<P>
 * National Park Service fees for park entrance and recreational facilities: 
$27 
</P>
<P>
 * New $15-per-hour fee for assistance provided at Small Business 
Administration Development Centers: $26 
</P>
<P>
 * Increased license fee paid by firearms dealers to the U.S. Treasury 
Department: $25 
</P>
<P>
 * IRS fee hike for making photocopies of tax returns, (from $4.25 to about $12

CITIES EMULATE THE LITTLE METROPOLIS THAT COULD; INNOVATIVE ARIZONA CAPITAL 
DRAWS PRAISE FOR COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCESS. RESIDENT LIKES THE SMALL-TOWN 
FEEL OF GOVERNMENT.

<P>
 And now, a news flash: Things are going well in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not stop-the-presses news, but Phoenix's quiet success as a municipality 
is beginning to be recognized. At a time when the Clinton Administration is 
discussing the concept of reinventing government, Phoenix is basking in the 
attention it is receiving for pioneering its own form of government, a system 
experts are lauding and other municipalities are adopting. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Paul Johnson believes that Phoenix's accomplishments bode well for the 
nation. "What's going to happen to government is going to have to happen at the 
local level first," he said. "I'm convinced the federal government is watching 
what's going on at the local level. And it's going to filter up." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Vice President Al Gore has pointed to Phoenix's competitive bidding 
process as an example of how an innovative government can increase 
productivity. The system, which pits the city against private enterprise in the 
delivery of city services, is being used in Indianapolis, Milwaukee and 
Philadelphia. Versions are being considered in Los Angeles and San Diego 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The competitive bidding system was praised by the German-based Bertelsmann 
Foundation, a nonprofit organization that last fall declared Phoenix one of the 
two best-managed cities in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Phoenix has been honored in other ways over the years, city officials 
say the Bertelsmann prize is the most gratifying. It is a onetime award with a 
worldwide scope. And the fact that a city the size of Phoenix (population 1.04 
million) was judged to be as well-managed as the much smaller Christchurch, New 
Zealand, (population 140,000) is a further source of pride. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Frank Fairbanks said Christchurch deserves the award, but he 
noted that the city reformed its management as part of a national mandate. 
Phoenix, on the other hand, has been able to produce an efficient, effective 
government without any guidance from above. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (Bertelsmann) judges called us 'The Lone Ranger,' " Fairbanks said. "We 
had been able to do all the same things as Christchurch, but we've done them 
alone and we've invented them for ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 So what is so great about Phoenix's form of government? What is it that has 
prompted more than 200 businesses, cities, counties, states and countries to 
inquire about Phoenix's management methods? 
</P>
<P>
 The Bertelsmann committee applauded lots of attributes that, government-speak 
aside, boil down to this: The city has been able to communicate effectively 
with its citizens and employees; it has been able to serve them efficiently, 
and it has not been afraid to try new tacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairbanks believes that innovation is the most important factor in Phoenix's 
success: "We don't get entrenched in things and do them the same way we've done 
them for 50 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Employees are encouraged to suggest new ways to serve the community. And 
officials level with the citizenry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people understand," Johnson said. "They understand that they can't have 
everything they want." The secret, he says, is to involve them in the process 
and encourage them to be part of the solution. 
</P>
<P>
 To those who might dismiss awards as bureaucratic back-patting and Johnson's 
philosophy as rhetoric, here are a few examples of success: 
</P>
<P>
 * The city has saved $25 million through the competitive bidding process begun 
in 1978. Tried first for garbage collection, the system now is used for 
delivery of 20 services, ranging from street sweeping to staffing the city's 
public defender's office. Another 40 are being considered for inclusion in the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 * Since the Phoenix Fire Department took over the ambulance services after 
competitive bidding in 1985, ambulances arrive at emergency scenes within 10 
minutes 94% of the time, doubling the private companies' response record. 
</P>
<P>
 * During what Johnson calls "the biggest budget crisis since the Great 
Depression" -- while population grew and demand for services increased -- the 
city trimmed 500 positions from its 11,000-member work force and spent less 
money last year than the previous year. All of that was accomplished without a 
tax increase, a labor dispute or any noticeable effect on services. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ordinary citizens participate in government. City Council meetings and 
budget hearings are regularly conducted on the road to give residents of the 
sprawling city better access to their leaders. Volunteers also take part in the 
Phoenix Futures Forum (an ongoing planning process), Neighborhood Watch crime 
prevention programs and Neighborhood Fight Back improvement programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have volunteered in droves to clean up mountain preserves, to 
maintain streets and medians, to read to children as part of the Mayor's 
Reading Corps and to support public schools through a corporate adoption 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Ima Jean Dolan got involved for the first time last year, attending public 
budget hearings to protest the planned cancellation of the annual electrical 
Christmas parade. Dolan, whose family had made participation in the amateur 
parade a holiday tradition, carried a jar of pennies and encouraged people to 
"throw in their two cents' worth." After Dolan collected nearly $6,000, the 
city reinstated the event and made Dolan grand marshal. 
</P>
<P>
 What impressed her most, she said, was the small-town feeling she got during 
meetings with the city's top officials. "I can't say enough about them," Dolan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Warm feelings aside, Phoenix is not a small town. It's the ninth-largest city 
in the country, and it faces serious problems like crime, air pollution and 
transportation woes. But because the government is efficient, Johnson said, it 
can better use resources to target such problems.

RUSSIAN SCIENTIST JAILED OVER PUBLISHING OF SECRETS IS FREED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A scientist being prosecuted for publishing an article about a top-secret 
Russian chemical-weapons program has been released from jail, raising hopes 
that the charges against the whistle-blower may be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "The general prosecutor's decision to free me was based on the fact that the 
accusation against me was completely falsified," chemist Vil S. Mirzayanov told 
reporters Wednesday, after his release from Matrosskaya prison late Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 If prosecutors agree to drop the case, that will end a highly politicized 
trial that has embarrassed the administration of Russian President Boris N. 
Yeltsin and raised questions about Moscow's commitment to human rights and 
chemical disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirzayanov was arrested in October, 1992, and charged with divulging state 
secrets after he published an article detailing Russia's development of a 
potent new generation of binary chemical weapons. He was released after 12 days 
but was arrested again last month after refusing to appear for a trial he 
considers an unconstitutional farce. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirzayanov said he will ask the Red Cross to visit the prison, where he says 
inmates are being held in overcrowded cells without sufficient food or fresh 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirzayanov's release follows loud protests by human rights activists and U.S. 
diplomats; embarrassing courtroom scenes reminiscent of the way the Soviet 
Union treated its dissidents, and a threat by a fellow scientist to reveal more 
state secrets unless Mirzayanov was freed.

 Israeli and Palestine Liberation Organization negotiators meeting in Cairo 
reported progress toward implementing their accord on limited Palestinian 
self-rule in the occupied territories. In a joint statement issued at the end 
of three days of talks, negotiators said they still need more time to resolve 
security and administrative issues and hope for further progress when talks 
resume next week.The latest round of talks focused on security arrangements for 
the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, the size of the Palestinian 
police force and where Palestinian police will be deployed. In Jerusalem, 
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said Israeli troops can withdraw from the 
Gaza Strip and the West Bank region of Jericho four weeks after Israel and the 
PLO resolve disputes holding up an autonomy agreement.

ARGENTINA BLOCKS TESTIMONY IN ITALIAN RIGHTS HEARINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM R. LONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Carlos Saul Menem's administration succeeded Wednesday in blocking 
legal testimony on the disappearances of 82 Italian citizens in Argentina while 
this country was under military rule. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge and a prosecutor from Italy stirred up a hornet's nest here after 
arriving Feb. 13 to hear testimony on the disappearances.Military authorities 
made it known that they were "concerned and irritated" over the Italian 
proceedings. Past and present military personnel, including former presidents 
of governing juntas, are implicated in the disappearances and could be tried in 
absentia in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Under military pressure, Menem spoke out against the hearings, putting himself 
in the middle of revived controversy over past human rights violations. Menem's 
justice minister initiated a request for an injunction to prevent the hearings. 
Human rights groups protested. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina's federal court of appeals ruled Wednesday that the matter is 
outside the jurisdiction of a lower federal judge who had agreed to aid the 
Italians in hearing the witnesses. If the judge disputes the ruling, the matter 
of jurisdiction may be decided by the Supreme Court, but that could take years. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentine investigations have documented the disappearances of more than 9,000 
civilians in the so-called "dirty war" between security forces and leftists 
during the 1976-83 regime. Military pressure, including a series of revolts, 
resulted in amnesties and pardons for hundreds of officers charged with 
violating human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the end of the regime, in 1982, Italian consulates in Argentina had 
received complaints that more than 600 Italian citizens were among those who 
had disappeared.

MEXICO REBELS SEE U.S. AS KEY TO PEACE AGREEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The southern rebels here acknowledged Wednesday that they are relying on 
international pressure -- particularly from the United States -- to enforce the 
peace agreement they are now negotiating with their government. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. government is going to pressure the Mexican government to make 
changes in order to prevent these kinds of movements from arising," said 
Subcommander Marcos, the spokesman for the rebels who took control of several 
towns in southern Mexico on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels, who call themselves the Zapatista National Liberation Army, 
quickly withdrew from the towns but still control large tracts of jungle in 
eastern Chiapas, a Mexican state on the Guatemalan border. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcos said he expects the United States to support the Zapatistas once U.S. 
intelligence agencies are convinced the movement is not influenced by Cubans or 
Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally, they are going to conclude that this is a Mexican problem, with just 
and true causes, and they will have to speak out because this affects U.S. 
security," he said, adding: "We are not talking about communism versus 
capitalism. We are talking about life or death." 
</P>
<P>
 International pressure was largely credited with pushing the government to 
declare a cease-fire on Jan. 11 and to invite the rebels to the negotiating 
table. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Wednesday, negotiators said they had agreed on issues of health care, 
education, housing, true and timely information and respect for Indian cultures 
and traditions; no specifics were provided. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, in a news conference with radio reporters before the third day of 
talks began, Marcos and 18 rebel delegates outlined their proposals for 
enforcing a peace pact and their objections to the North American Free Trade 
Agreement, which they said harms poor Mexican farmers.

 Gov. Chris Patten's push for electoral reform in Hong Kong, despite strong 
Chinese government opposition, cleared its first legislative hurdle.The British 
colony's 60-member Legislative Council overwhelmingly passed a "first stage" 
reform bill containing the least controversial elements of a reform package 
that Patten unveiled in October, 1992. The bill's passage allows Patten to 
begin work on a second bill containing further reforms. That bill -- which 
China finds even more objectionable -- includes steps to significantly broaden 
the voting base for future elections. China says it will scrap such reforms 
when it assumes control of the colony in 1997.

WORLD IN BRIEF; PHILIPPINES; MARCOS ESTATE ASSESSED $1.2 BILLION

 A federal jury in Honolulu ordered the estate of the late Philippine President 
Ferdinand E. Marcos to pay $1.2 billion in damages to thousands of dissidents 
said to have suffered under his rule. The award was made in an unprecedented 
class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of more than 10,000 dissidents and 
political opponents alleged to have been subjected to torture, murder, rape and 
imprisonment from 1972 until the overthrow of Marcos in 1986. The same 
10-member jury found Marcos' estate liable in September, 1992, for the human 
rights abuses, but legal wrangling delayed the award phase of the trial.

U.S. SEEKS TO AVOID SPY RIFT WITH RUSSIA; ESPIONAGE: INTELLIGENCE SOURCES BLAME 
CIA SUSPECT FOR THE DEATHS OF AT LEAST TWO AGENTS. WHITE HOUSE CALLS FOR MOSCOW 
TO COOPERATE WITH PROBE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration sought Wednesday to keep U.S.-Russian relations 
from suffering a major setback, even as intelligence sources blamed the deaths 
of at least two agents and possibly many more on the CIA official accused of 
spying for the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with congressional calls for an immediate suspension of Russian aid, the 
White House warned of diplomatic reprisals unless Moscow ceases its espionage 
activities in the United States and cooperates with efforts to assess the 
damage investigators believe was done to U.S. intelligence by Aldrich Hazen 
Ames. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames, former head of the CIA's Soviet counterintelligence division, and his 
wife were arrested on espionage charges Monday. The government contends that 
since 1985 they traded intelligence secrets first to the Soviets and then to 
the Russian Federation for payments totaling $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very serious case and it has to be pursued aggressively and we will 
do that," President Clinton told reporters at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 On Capitol Hill, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. 
Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), said the damage inflicted on the CIA's 
intelligence-gathering operations in the former Soviet Union had been enormous 
during the nine years that Aldrich is alleged to have been a Kremlin "mole." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm assuming some executions occurred," DeConcini said, refusing to 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Former intelligence officials told The Times that at least two CIA agents, 
both Russians, were executed after being caught while Ames was providing Moscow 
with information about the CIA's intelligence-gathering abilities in the former 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 One senior CIA official, now retired, said the agents were captured in 1991 as 
a result of information supplied by Ames. Another senior intelligence official 
confirmed the deaths but said it was unclear whether they were the result of 
Ames' alleged betrayal. 
</P>
<P>
 According to some accounts, the number of executions may have been as high as 
10, although not all may ever be linked to Ames. 
</P>
<P>
 DeConcini led a chorus of congressional calls Wednesday for temporarily 
freezing aid to Russia as a means of persuading Moscow to disclose to U.S. 
officials the information allegedly supplied by Ames. Officials said that Ames, 
who remains in federal custody, is refusing to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
 "My guess is the Russians will respond positively and cooperate" if threatened 
with a suspension of their share of the $2.5 billion in economic assistance 
that Congress appropriated for the former Soviet republics last year, DeConcini 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although warning of possible reprisals, Clinton and other senior 
Administration officials took pains Wednesday to try to contain the scandal, 
warning that anger over it must not be allowed to throw U.S.-Russian relations 
back into a Cold War-style freeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton stressed that America's strategic interests still are best served by 
encouraging Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin's democratic reforms. He said he 
would wait for Moscow's response before deciding on a next step. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly concerned about the possible backlash on Capitol Hill, other 
Administration officials sought to portray the scandal as something of an 
aberration in U.S.-Russian relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to move forward into the future with our eyes wide open and we have 
to note the extent to which this is a story whose origins are in the past," 
Vice President Al Gore said in a speech to the U.S.-Russia Business Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said privately that Clinton, a strong supporter of 
Yeltsin, has asked the Russian leader to ease the pressure for retaliation by 
helping with the damage assessment and by recalling the two Russian Embassy 
officials who were believed to be Ames' control officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't take action, we will," White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher said the extent of damage to the U.S.-Russian relationship 
"will depend on Russian actions in the days ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to be more specific. But a number of senators said more than just 
the recall of diplomats or expressions of outrage will be needed to cool 
congressional anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's safe to say the future of aid to Russia, supported on a bipartisan basis 
last year, is now seriously in question," said Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), 
ranking Republican on the subcommittee that determines foreign aid levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Siding with the Administration, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the 
Appropriations Committee's subcommittee on foreign operations, said he hopes 
that members of Congress will not "lose sight of where our strategic interests 
lie and what must be done to serve them" when the 1995 aid package is debated 
later this year.

SPECIAL COUNSEL APPOINTS 8 WHITEWATER PROBE AIDES; INVESTIGATION: ONE WILL 
FOCUS SOLELY ON EVENTS SURROUNDING FOSTER'S DEATH. TEXAN WILL TRY CASE 
INVOLVING LOAN TO PARTNER IN THE REAL ESTATE DEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA FRITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. on Wednesday appointed eight lawyers to 
assist in his investigation of the Whitewater affair -- most of them, like 
himself, attorneys from New York, but two of them Southerners whose style will 
be more familiar in President Clinton's home state of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Fiske declined to discuss details of the investigation, his 
appointments revealed much about the strategy he intends to use in pursuing a 
wide investigation of Clinton's joint investment in the Whitewater Development 
Corp. with James B. McDougal, the owner of a failed savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Fiske made it clear that he regards as serious the allegations 
that Whitewater may have precipitated the apparent suicide last year of White 
House lawyer Vincent Foster. Files on the Whitewater deal were removed from 
Foster's office by Clinton aides shortly before law enforcement authorities 
arrived to investigate the suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske said one of his appointees, Roderick C. Lankler, a New York lawyer and 
former prosecutor, will be located in Washington and assigned to focus strictly 
on events surrounding Foster's death. Once chief litigator under New York Dist. 
Atty. Robert M. Morgenthau, Lankler has assisted in several New York political 
corruption inquiries since entering private practice in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 The special counsel, appointed by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno little more than a 
month ago, also made it clear that he intends a fast start that will enable him 
to complete the investigation within a year. To that end, he said he will be 
ready by March 28 to prosecute former Arkansas Judge David Hale, along with two 
co-defendants, on loan fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the charges against him are technically unrelated to Whitewater, Hale 
contends that he acted on Clinton's request when he loaned $300,000 from his 
government-subsidized venture capital investment fund to Susan McDougal, James 
McDougal's ex-wife and another partner in the Whitewater deal along with First 
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, sources said, Fiske has refused to offer Hale leniency in exchange for 
his testimony about the Clintons. But Fiske's decision to take responsibility 
for the Hale case, which was being investigated by the Justice Department, was 
seen by lawyers in the case as an acknowledgment of Hale's contention that the 
cases are related. 
</P>
<P>
 A partner in the prominent New York law firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell and a 
former U.S. attorney in Manhattan during the Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter 
administrations, Fiske predictably selected mostly attorneys with backgrounds 
similar to his. Only three of his appointees were from outside New York. 
</P>
<P>
 But recognizing that his legal team may encounter some hostility from friends 
of Clinton in the President's home state of Arkansas, Fiske chose an 
experienced Texas trial lawyer with a thick Southern drawl, Russell (Rusty) 
Hardin Jr., to try Hale's case in federal court in Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske said he does not intend to ask for a postponement of the trial while 
Hardin becomes familiar with the case. He said Hardin already is working with 
Denis J. McInerney, a close Fiske associate who joined the investigation 
shortly after the independent counsel was chosen but was not officially 
appointed until Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The other Southerner appointed by Fiske is William S. Duffey Jr. A resident of 
Atlanta and a partner in the firm of King & Spalding, Duffey has specialized in 
complex civil and criminal investigations, including an internal investigation 
of E. F. Hutton after the firm pleaded guilty to 2,001 counts of mail and wire 
fraud. He also participated in the internal Exxon inquiry after the 1989 
grounding of the Exxon Valdez in Alaska's Prince William Sound resulted in the 
biggest oil spill in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Fiske is said to be undaunted by the length of time that has passed 
since the events of Whitewater or by the number of missing documents, he is 
understood to be sensitive to feelings of many former Clinton associates in 
Arkansas who think that they have been falsely portrayed in the Northern press 
as a network of "good ol' boys." 
</P>
<P>
 That sentiment was expressed recently by McDougal's attorney, Sam Huer of 
Little Rock, who said in an Associated Press interview that he resented the new 
round of "Arkansas-ology" that the Whitewater investigation had sparked. 
</P>
<P>
 As many reporters have discovered, most Arkansans involved in Whitewater have 
repeated their recollections so often to the news media and law enforcement 
officials that Fiske will be hard-pressed to find fresh witnesses whose stories 
have not been simplified by constant repetition. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske already has met with lawyers representing many of the key figures in the 
case, among them Bobby McDaniel, lawyer for Susan McDougal, and Randy Coleman, 
Hale's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske's investigation must determine, among other things, whether federally 
guaranteed funds from McDougal's Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan were funneled 
into Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske's assistants bring an impressive record of experience in white-collar 
crime cases. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Lankler, Hardin, McInerney and Duffey, his staff includes Julie 
R. O'Sullivan, a Stanford graduate who worked with Fiske at Davis Polke & 
Wardwell until she became assistant U.S. attorney in New York in 1991; Patrick 
J. Smith, an associate at Davis Polk; Mark J. Stein, another former Davis Polk 
lawyer who was deputy chief of the criminal division of the U.S. attorney's 
office in New York, and Carl J. Stich Jr., a partner in the Cincinnati law firm 
of Dinsmore & Shohl.

CLINTON ALLIES PUSH HEALTH COOPERATIVES; CONGRESS: LAWMAKERS WHO BACK THE IDEA 
SAY IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO ENSURE CHOICE. BUT A PANEL CHAIRMAN PREDICTS THAT THE 
APPROACH WILL FAIL.

<P>
 President Clinton's allies on Capitol Hill mounted an offensive Wednesday to 
rescue a central element of his health care reform plan: the gigantic 
purchasing cooperatives through which most Americans would be required to 
obtain their health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.) insisted that the alliances must 
remain in the legislation because they are "the heart and soul of what health 
care reform is about." 
</P>
<P>
 Only the purchasing cooperatives could assure that consumers would have a 
choice among health plans, said Rockefeller, Senate Labor and Human Resources 
Committee Chairman Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and several other key Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 And only the purchasing cooperatives, they told reporters, would spread the 
risks of insuring certain groups, such as people with costly health conditions, 
who might otherwise be unable to find affordable care. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way to replicate the advantages" of alliances, Sen. Thomas A. 
Daschle (D-S.D.) insisted. "You'll lose efficiency. You may lose universal 
coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, even as these senators showed their support for the concept, Rep. Pete 
Stark (D-Oakland), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee's 
subcommittee on health, repeated his prediction that the government-organized 
purchasing cooperatives would not be approved by his panel or by the House as a 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Stark, an opponent of the purchasing cooperatives and proponent of competing 
"single-payer" health care delivery, said no one on the subcommittee supports 
mandatory alliances. Some subcommittee members have complained that the 
alliances would inject big government into the health care system, he said, and 
others have said they believe that the alliances' task would be more than they 
could manage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President has great goals we're going to try to achieve," Stark said. 
"The alliances will not survive, so we're going to have to find other ways to 
do what the alliances would have done." 
</P>
<P>
 Stark's subcommittee, which is scheduled to begin piecing together its version 
of the legislation next week, will be the first of at least two in the House 
and two more in the Senate that will be part of the bill-drafting process. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, the Finance Committee's views on the alliances are likely to 
become clearer today when it conducts a hearing on the subject. Daschle and 
Rockefeller -- supporters of the concept -- are on the panel but Chairman 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) has made it clear that he is deeply skeptical 
of mandatory alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 With the health reform focus shifting to Capitol Hill, President Clinton met 
late Wednesday with about a dozen House members who support a rival 
Canadian-style single-payer proposal, assuring them that he remains committed 
to the principle that any reform plan must lead to universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The President reiterated his intention -- disclosed during a speech to 
Congress in January -- to veto any bill that does not guarantee coverage for 
every American, said Rep. Jim McDermott (D-Wash.), author of the single-payer 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "He realizes that the committees are starting their work, and he just wanted 
to hear where the single-payer people are," McDermott said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another participant in the hourlong White House meeting said afterward: "We 
let the President know that, if he retreats from universal coverage, we're not 
going to be with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Also attending the meeting were Vice President Al Gore, First Lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton, Deputy White House Chief of Staff Harold Ickes and senior 
advisers Ira Magaziner and George Stephanopoulos. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, another senior Administration official, seeking to shore 
up support for another element of Clinton's massive reform plan, told reporters 
that its long-term care provisions are essential to provide all Americans with 
"health security." 
</P>
<P>
 When the plan is fully implemented by the year 2003, more than 3 million 
Americans would be eligible for home- and community-based care that would keep 
them out of nursing homes, said Judy Feder, a deputy assistant secretary at the 
Health and Human Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Russell D. Feingold (D-Wis.), a co-sponsor of the single-payer approach, 
also praised Clinton's long-term care proposal, which would institute a new 
program financed largely by the federal government but designed and 
administered by state and local governments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a big mistake" to eliminate the long-term care program, Feingold 
told a group of reporters. "We've got to work hard (to preserve it) because 
everything's at risk." 
</P>
<P>
 The President also intends next week to stage an event to highlight the 
long-term care provisions. Many elderly groups told Clinton during a White 
House meeting last week that, without long-term care coverage, they would not 
support his overall agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 The $65-billion program, to be phased in starting in 1996, would be financed 
mostly through anticipated savings from reductions in the growth of Medicare 
and Medicaid, Feder said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal is modeled after a 12-year-old program in Wisconsin that has 
saved the state significantly more than $100 million by keeping people at home 
instead of in nursing homes, where costs are much higher, said Feingold, the 
program's creator. 
</P>
<P>
 Feingold said the average per-capita cost of providing home care subsidies in 
Wisconsin is $8,724 a year, contrasted with about $30,000 in a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Wednesday, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, after much internal 
discussion, decided at least for now to adhere to its opposition to Clinton's 
requirement that employers pay for the bulk of their workers' health insurance 
costs.

JURORS BEGIN DELIBERATIONS IN CULT TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIANNE HART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jurors began deliberations Wednesday in the murder-and-conspiracy trial of 11 
Branch Davidians charged in the deaths of four federal agents during a botched 
raid on the cult's compound a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Asserting that the cult members not only had a right but a duty to defend 
themselves against excessive government force, defense attorney Dan Cogdell 
said in his closing arguments that "the government has taken the position that 
as long as a person has a badge and gun, it doesn't matter. They can hit your 
house with 75 agents, they can gas it . . . in the name of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole world is going to be looking at the verdict in this case to 
determine the standard of care of law enforcement in this country," Cogdell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agents died when the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms tried to 
serve a search warrant for illegal weapons and an arrest warrant for cult 
leader David Koresh at his Mt. Carmel complex near Waco, Tex., last February. 
</P>
<P>
 The 51-day siege that followed ended in the fiery deaths of more than 80 sect 
members after federal agents assaulted the compound. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors disputed claims that the ATF used excessive force, saying 
it was ludicrous to put the government on trial when the 11 cult members had 
the opportunity to walk away from the complex at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (federal agents) didn't use enough force. They went up against an armed 
camp -- not a home, not a church, but an armed camp," prosecutor John Phinizy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why didn't (the defendants) walk out? If you want to save yourself, you walk 
out the door. They stayed. And is it self-defense? No. Are they trying to kill 
somebody? You bet," Phinizy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's case is based on an alleged conspiracy by the Branch 
Davidians to kill federal agents. But defense attorneys asserted that many of 
the cult members lacked knowledge of Koresh's plans, and therefore lacked the 
necessary intent to conspire to kill. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury deliberated about two hours Wednesday before recessing for the day. 
Deliberations were to resume today.

EXAMINERS TO USE SPECIAL GEAR TO AUTOPSY FUME-FILLED BODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The autopsy of a woman who apparently contaminated a hospital emergency room 
last Saturday, injuring six medical personnel, has been postponed until at 
least this evening while investigators procure full hazardous material gear for 
protection, the Riverside County coroner's office said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The body, double-bagged and sealed in an aluminum case, is being stored in a 
refrigerated room while preparations are being made. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the team is searching for other clues to explain the bizarre 
incident in which Gloria Ramirez, a 31-year-old cancer patient, was brought 
into the emergency room of Riverside General Hospital suffering a heart attack. 
While she was being unsuccessfully treated, fumes apparently emanating from her 
body overcame a doctor and five nurses. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Julie Gorchinski, the most seriously injured, remained hospitalized 
Wednesday in fair condition at Loma Linda University Medical Center, hospital 
spokeswoman Anita Rockwell said. Physicians hoped to wean her from a respirator 
Wednesday evening, Rockwell said, but a similar attempt the night before proved 
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorchinski's muscles have not completely relaxed since the incident and she 
has had periodic, mild spasms. 
</P>
<P>
 Blood tests have shown that Gorchinksi was exposed to a chemical in the 
organophosphate family, which includes the primary ingredients of nerve gas and 
many pesticides. She is expected to recover. 
</P>
<P>
 Nurse Sally Balderas is expected to be released from Parkview Community 
Hospital in Riverside by the weekend. Four other nurses were treated and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 Loma Linda officials also issued a clarification Wednesday of Ramirez's 
medical history. Rockwell said Ramirez was first examined at Loma Linda on Feb. 
9 for a "previously diagnosed" advanced cancer of the cervix -- not ovarian 
cancer, as had been reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez received neither radiation nor chemotherapy at Loma Linda, Rockwell 
said, and treatment plans for her did not include chemotherapy. It was not 
clear Wednesday what treatment she may have received elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to procuring the special safety outfits -- "Level A" gear, the 
highest level of protection available to hazardous materials workers -- 
authorities at the coroner's office were contacting other agencies to ensure 
that all necessary precautions will be taken, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The autopsy was scheduled for after 6 p.m. today in a special isolation room 
at the Riverside County morgue usually used for subjects with infectious 
diseases or chemical exposures. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the use of hazardous materials gear is unusual, autopsies of 
contaminated or infected subjects are not, said Scott Carrier of the Los 
Angeles County coroner's office. Bodies contaminated with chemicals, HIV and 
other infectious diseases "are occupational hazards that you deal with at the 
coroner's office," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One alternative to the use of special gear, he said, would be the use of a 
commercially available plastic pouch that would completely encase the body, 
allowing investigators to work on it through built-in gloves.

BOY PLANNED TO KILL FATHER, AMBUSH POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER and DOUG SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 When 17-year-old Christopher Golly fatally shot his father and then opened 
fire on police with an assault rifle, killing a rookie female officer, he was 
carrying out an ambush that he planned and discussed the day before, Los 
Angeles police officials and a friend of the dead youth said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Just hours before the shooting, the young gunman, a heavy methamphetamine 
user, described his mental state to his best friend with the words "Insanity is 
fun," the friend told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The remark was made during one of several conversations the afternoon and 
evening preceding the attack in which Golly made "specific threats" that he 
planned to kill his father, Steven Golly, 49, and then fight "a gun battle" 
with officers called to the scene, said Police Lt. Daniel Lang. 
</P>
<P>
 But officers did not know that when they were called to the middle-class 
Northridge neighborhood about 1:20 a.m. Tuesday, where Golly had just shot his 
Vietnam veteran father to death using a military-style semiautomatic rifle -- 
which his gun enthusiast father had given him as a gift so they could share a 
common interest, according to a family friend. 
</P>
<P>
 The son gunned down the father to the music of "The End," a song by The Doors 
in which singer Jim Morrison fantasized about killing his father. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in a bloody scene that played out precisely as police say the younger 
Golly threatened, he opened fire from an ambush position beside the dark house 
on six officers arriving to investigate a report of shots fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Golly was waiting with an AR-15-type assault rifle behind a brick wall where 
he had "a visual kill zone of 180 degrees," said Lang, officer in charge of the 
Los Angeles Police Department's Major Crimes Investigations Section. 
</P>
<P>
 Killed in the spray of at least 14 shots was police rookie Christy Lynne 
Hamilton, 45, struck by one shot through an armhole in her bulletproof vest, a 
gift from her mother. She became the second female Los Angeles police officer 
to die in the line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth then retreated to the house and shot himself to death with a 
.22-caliber handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators learned that the teen-ager "had made specific threats that he 
was going to kill a police officer," said a police spokesman, Lt. John Dunkin. 
But, he added, "we became aware after the officer was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we knew that (beforehand), I can assure you that other steps would have 
been taken," Dunkin said. "We would have tried to locate and talk to him well 
before this situation." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the last people Golly talked with was Matt Conner, 18, who described 
himself as Golly's best friend. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with The Times on Wednesday, Conner said he talked with Golly 
at Golly's house about 9 p.m. Monday and "he said he was going to take the 
assault rifle and shoot him," meaning his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he plans on taking a couple people with him. He wanted to take out a 
cop, and a cop car," Conner said. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Gee, Matt, insanity is fun,' " Conner quoted Golly as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 But Conner said he persuaded Golly to "promise on our friendship" that he 
wouldn't shoot anyone. "The last words he said were, 'I give you my word that I 
wouldn't do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A message written in black marker pen on Golly's bedroom wall when a reporter 
entered it Wednesday said: "Friends & Butthead made me do this hah-hah. Tell 
Matt I said, 'Sorry.' 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Conner, who volunteered his testimony to officers even before they 
left the shooting scene Tuesday morning, will not be charged with any crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Bever, the live-in girlfriend of Steven Golly, said in an interview that 
Christopher Golly was especially depressed since a Feb. 14 marijuana conviction 
that led to suspension of his driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
 After a quiet dinner Monday night, Christopher defied the suspension by taking 
his truck for a drive, she said, prompting his father to say that he would 
"have to disable the (truck)." 
</P>
<P>
 Early Tuesday morning, the constant throb of the bass from the boy's stereo 
could be clearly heard in the couple's bedroom, Bever said. Then, about 1 a.m., 
the volume suddenly increased. She said the song was "The End." 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Golly got out of bed. Bever heard him open his son's door and angrily 
ask what was going on. There was a "pop" sound and a flash of light. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it was a gun," Bever said, and Steven Golly fell face-forward onto the 
floor, shot once. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-year-old then calmly asked Bever and Bever's son Aaron to leave the 
house. Aaron's girlfriend, Connie McGovern, had already left the house. 
</P>
<P>
 McGovern returned to take the cordless telephone with her. From outside, 
McGovern called 911. 
</P>
<P>
 In conducting a routine review of the fatal confrontation, police determined 
that there were no tactical errors, but that officers unwittingly exposed 
themselves because Golly's corner house had an address that made them expect to 
find it in the middle of the block, where they saw a woman waving to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, they pulled their black-and-white squad cars up right in front 
of the Golly house or next to it, making them easy targets. 
</P>
<P>
 "They stop in what they think is a position of advantage down the street, and 
unbeknownst to them it is right in front of the house," said Dunkin. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Golly fired at least 14 shots at two squad cars as the officers 
emerged, including two shots at Hamilton's cruiser. But they said it was too 
dark for him to be aiming at any particular officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton's mother, Marge Hoffberg, former wife of an LAPD detective, said she 
wanted her daughter to become a teacher rather than a police officer, because 
she remembered the 17 years she had spent worrying whether her husband was 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her apprehensions, Hoffberg said she was proud when Hamilton graduated 
from the Police Academy only last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "She realized a dream that she had," Hoffberg said. "I'd rather she'd be here 
with me tonight, but you can't live your children's lives. She did what she had 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffberg said she bought the bulletproof vest because her daughter could not 
afford all the equipment needed for police training. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted her chest protected," Hoffberg said. "I wanted to do something to 
save her life if she ever needed it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Golly family, the father apparently used guns to maintain a 
relationship with his increasingly estranged son. Steven Golly's business 
partner and 30-year friend, Yo Hasegawa, said that Steven Golly and his son 
often went target practicing and that the AR-15-type rifle was one of their 
favorite weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew he had bought it for his son and they used it a lot for target 
shooting," said Hasegawa, a partner with Golly and another man in the Acme 
Electric Supply Co. Inc. of Culver City, a wholesale supplier of electrical 
equipment. "I know the son had shot that gun a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and other members of the Golly family said the bloody neighborhood 
shooting was apparently the finale of a long deterioration in the teen-ager, 
touched off, they believe, by the death of Christopher Golly's mother from a 
cocaine overdose four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was close to no one that I know except for his mom and possibly his dad," 
said the youth's maternal grandfather, Ernest J. Reepmaker. "He has always been 
an inward person, never showed feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 Reepmaker partly blamed his daughter, Pamela Golly, who lived in a house in 
Acton after separating from the boy's father. 
</P>
<P>
 "She'd make a date with him to go to a movie and dinner and a couple hours 
before she'd call up and give him out-of-your-mind excuses." 
</P>
<P>
 A good student in elementary and junior high school, Christopher had recently 
been skipping class and had begun a study-at-home program after being 
transferred from Granada Hills High School to the Granada Hills Continuation 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends said that he liked to play video games and pool and that he favored 
"speed metal," a driving guitar-based music that is a marriage between punk and 
heavy metal. 
</P>
<P>
 Although friends said Golly had become a frequent user of methamphetamines, no 
drugs were found in the house, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting drew national attention when President Clinton referred to it 
during his comments on new earthquake aid to California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though this is a time of renewal and reconstruction for the people of 
Los Angeles and California, it's also a day of sadness for many people in that 
area and for many of the rest of us who believe in the rule of law and 
appreciate those who enforce it," Clinton said.

LAUGH-FILLED DINNER GAVE NO HINT OF THE RAMPAGE TO COME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHAU LAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A few hours before Christopher Golly shot his father, Steven, and then later 
killed a police officer and himself, the five members of the Golly household 
sat down for an uneventful dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 For Susan Bever, Steven Golly's live-in girlfriend, there was no hint of the 
horrific events to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris ate like a horse," said Bever in an interview at the house in 
Northridge on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He took roast beef, poured gravy all over it and made a sandwich. We all 
laughed." 
</P>
<P>
 Also at the dinner were Bever's son, Aaron, 22, and his girlfriend, Connie 
McGovern, 21. There was none of the friction, Bever said, that had so often 
arisen between Steven, 49, part-owner of an electrical supply company, and 
Christopher, 17, over the teen-ager's school and drug problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Tensions in the house had been especially bad since Feb. 14, when Christopher 
was convicted of possession of marijuana, and the judge suspended his driver's 
license for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "He went into a depression, his personality became darker than before," Bever 
said. "He didn't take it too well." 
</P>
<P>
 After dinner, while Bever was doing the dishes and Steven Golly was reading a 
newspaper, Christopher defied the suspension by taking his truck for a drive, 
Bever said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Christopher returned about 8:30 p.m., father and son argued and Steven 
said he intended to make sure Christopher could no longer drive the truck. "I 
guess I have to disable the (truck)," he told Bever. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher's friend Matt Conner, 18, came by the house about 9 p.m., 
according to Conner, who was also interviewed Wednesday. The two teen-agers sat 
on the front lawn and talked. Conner said his friend was angry at his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris said he was going to take the assault rifle and shoot him," Conner 
said, referring to Steven Golly. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he wanted to be on the news," Conner said, "he wanted to be famous." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Christopher confessed to Conner that he thought he was crazy. 
But he didn't seem worried about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gee, Matt, insanity is fun," he told Conner. 
</P>
<P>
 During the approximately hour-and-a-half that the teen-agers sat talking, 
Steven came out three times and argued with his son about the truck, Conner 
said. "Each time it was longer and more explosive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conner tried to console him by saying, "There's always tomorrow," but 
Christopher replied: "No, this is the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Conner said he left and Christopher went back into his house about 10:30. By 
11 p.m., Bever said, she and Steven Golly had gone to bed. 
</P>
<P>
 McGovern, also interviewed Wednesday, said she returned home from an evening 
with a friend about 11:30 p.m. Christopher asked her to drive him to a nearby 
service station to buy cigarettes. When they came back, she said, they went to 
the back yard where he sniffed nitrous oxide, an anesthetic often called 
"laughing gas." At 12:30 a.m., McGovern said she went to bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before 1 a.m., Bever said, she awoke and felt vibrations from the 
stereo in Christopher's room next door. About five minutes later, she said, 
"suddenly, the stereo was cranked on high." 
</P>
<P>
 Loudly enough that McGovern could hear it in a bedroom on the opposite side of 
the house, Christopher Golly turned up the volume on "The End," by The Doors -- 
a song in which the singer fantasizes about killing his father. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed only in white pajama shorts, Steven Golly headed to his son's door. 
</P>
<P>
 Bever heard Steven open the door and angrily ask his son what was "going on?" 
</P>
<P>
 There was a "pop" sound and then a flash of light. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it was a gun," Bever said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hallway she saw Steven face down on the floor of Christopher's room. 
Christopher was standing next to the body, she said, holding a rifle in his 
right hand. 
</P>
<P>
 She said to Christopher, "Oh my God, Chris, you really did it," and walked 
toward the body, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher calmly warned her away. "Get out of the house, you don't want to 
see this," she said he told her. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Bever joined his mother in the hallway. He spoke to Christopher. "I told 
him to give me the gun," Aaron said on Wednesday, "and he told me to get out of 
the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "He seemed scared, but he seemed to know what he was doing," Aaron Bever said. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan and Aaron Bever left. McGovern was already outside -- she had gone out 
when the music was turned up because she thought the sound was coming from the 
garage. When she heard the shots, McGovern said, she immediately thought 
Christopher had gone on a rampage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew right then it was Steve," she said. "I was waiting to hear another one 
for Susan." 
</P>
<P>
 McGovern ran back for a cordless telephone. As she walked to the street, she 
called 911. 
</P>
<P>
 As all three walked toward a neighbor's house, they heard the sirens of 
approaching police cars, and McGovern walked back toward the house to meet the 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she got as far as the mailbox on the sidewalk in front of the house 
when shots rang out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard people scream, 'Get down!' and a police officer pushed me to the 
ground," McGovern said, but she saw neither Christopher, nor the policewoman he 
fatally shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm lost," Susan Bevers said quietly during the interview. "Steven was my 
best friend."

FAMILY OF SLAIN OFFICER REMEMBERS A 'SURVIVOR'; TRIBUTE: OFFICERS AND FRIENDS 
VISIT CHRISTY HAMILTON'S PARENTS. THEY HAD CELEBRATED HER GRADUATION LAST WEEK.

 This wasn't supposed to happen. Not to Christy, they thought. Not now. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Christy Lynne Hamilton. Killed in the line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
 The words tested their faith. The unthinkable had happened and it was easier 
to deny than accept. "My sister's a survivor. She's always been a survivor," 
said Los Angeles Firefighter Kenneth Brondell Jr. "I can hear her voice all the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 For those who loved Christy Hamilton, there was little left to do Wednesday 
but follow the well-worn rituals that guide people through times of shock and 
grief. In Van Nuys, a steady stream of police officers filed by the home of 
Hamilton's father, retired LAPD detective Kenneth Brondell Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 In Palm Desert, friends carried casseroles to the home of her mother, Marge 
Hoffberg, and spoke about how they all loved Christy. 
</P>
<P>
 And Wednesday evening, about 10 friends and relatives gathered to remember 
Hamilton at the Canyon Country home of her brother. Mechanically, they ate 
sandwiches and watched television news accounts of Hamilton's shooting death at 
the hands of a troubled teen-ager who shot at police with an assault weapon in 
suburban Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seeing Christy on TV and all those interviews, it makes it seem like she's 
still alive," her brother said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over five short days, Hamilton's friends and family have endured enough highs 
and lows to give them a severe case of the emotional bends. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, she graduated at age 45 from the Police Academy, honored by her 
peers as the most inspirational member of their class. On Saturday, she thanked 
her friends and family, singling out each person for special acknowledgment 
during a speech at a party celebrating her Police Academy graduation. 
Forty-eight hours later, she was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hamilton entered the Police Academy eight months ago, her mother and 
father bought her gifts that bespoke their own reactions -- he gave her a gun, 
she gave her a bulletproof vest. Her father beamed with pride at his daughter's 
late career choice. But Hoffberg could not forget the 17 years of fear she 
lived with when he went to work each day, a fear she blames for the ultimate 
demise of their marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was married to a cop and he was married to the job," she said. "I was 
always frightened." 
</P>
<P>
 But since those days, Hoffberg had learned how to let go. Although she regrets 
her daughter's decision to become a cop, she accepts it. 
</P>
<P>
 "She realized a dream that she had. What can I say? Sure, I'd rather she'd be 
here with me tonight. But you can't live your children's lives. She did what 
she had to do," Hoffberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton was spunky and determined. Born with an intestinal tumor, she barely 
survived infancy, her mother said. Her parents divorced when she was 15. A 
marriage at 19 quickly ended. Her second marriage broke up when she went back 
to school at Cal State Northridge in the late 1980s after raising a family, a 
responsibility which long postponed her dream of joining the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was devastated over the breakup of her marriage," Hoffberg said. "She 
threw herself into the training program of the Police Department. I think what 
happened was she realized she had lost him and she'd better have a job that 
would give her some security." 
</P>
<P>
 Although often battered and bruised from the physical training, Hamilton never 
missed a day at the academy. "When she'd get off some of these shifts, she'd be 
dog tired," Brondell, her brother, recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "She'd have bruises all over her, and she would only have two or three hours' 
of sleep. I don't think anybody went through that place with more adversity 
than my sister." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she confided to her mother that sometimes she hurt so badly she 
doubted she'd make it, Hamilton always presented a brave face to her father. 
</P>
<P>
 "She told me, 'I wasn't ever the first, but I was never the last,' " he 
recalled.

ROBERTI SEEKS STATE BAN ON 'COPY CAT' ASSAULT RIFLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Sen. David A. Roberti, who faces an April recall election mounted by gun 
activists, Wednesday called on the state attorney general to immediately add 
"copy cat" assault rifles -- particularly those patterned after the AR-15 like 
the gun used in Tuesday's killing of a rookie policewoman -- to the state's 
list of banned weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We strongly urge Atty. Gen. (Dan) Lungren to use his power to ban the 
manufacture, sale and transfer to every single assault weapon on sale in 
California today . . . and every new variation that Colt or any other assault 
weapon-maker wants to put onto the streets," Roberti said at a news conference 
from his Van Nuys office. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Lungren said the attorney general is already compiling a list 
of additional assault rifles to add to the list of those now banned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just about there," said Dave Puglia, Lungren's press secretary. "There 
is no disagreement with the senator." 
</P>
<P>
 An official with Hartford, Conn.-based Colt's Manufacturing Co. disagreed that 
the Colt Sporter -- which Roberti asserts is a look-alike to the banned Colt 
AR-15 -- is an assault rifle and vowed to continue to fight any ban on that 
firearm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe it should not be banned," said Mike Reissig, a Colt vice 
president. "This weapon is designed and produced for hunting and sporting use, 
such as target shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 Reissig also downplayed the role of assault weapons in criminal activity, 
saying less than 1% of all crimes involving guns include such weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 But an AR-15 type assault rifle was used to kill LAPD Officer Christy Lynne 
Hamilton, 45, a recent Police Academy graduate who died Tuesday after being 
shot once in the chest as she and other officers responded to a call of gunfire 
at a Northridge home. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Christopher Golly, 17, used an AR-15 type, a civilian version of 
the military's M-16 rifle, to shoot Hamilton after shooting his father, Steven 
R. Golly, a Vietnam veteran and gun collector. The teen-ager, who was described 
by friends as a troubled drug user at odds with his father, later shot himself 
before police stormed the house. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, President Clinton eulogized Hamilton as a "policewoman who 
could have made a difference to people on her beat" and used the occasion to 
urge passage of anti-crime federal legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our duty is clear, we have pending before the Congress an opportunity to pass 
crime legislation that is both tough and smart, that would put another 100,000 
police officers on the street -- a proposal of real value for the cities of 
California -- and at the same time ban the kinds of semiautomatic weapons that 
are used for killing people like Christy Hamilton and which have no 
justification for sporting or hunting purposes," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti authored the state's landmark Assault Weapons Control Act of 1989, 
which outlawed 67 specific semiautomatic assault rifles and gave the attorney 
general the power to extend that ban to cover other assault weapons that were 
substantially the same as those already on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Roberti trotted out an AK-47 assault rifle and had it fired at 
watermelons in a noisy demonstration to underline his contention that backers 
of his April 12 recall election are angry at him for authoring the weapons act. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti, whose term expires this fall and is not seeking reelection, is 
expected to seek statewide office. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Lungren began the process to add the Colt Sporter to the list of 
banned weapons, saying it was essentially the Colt AR-15 under a different 
name. But Colt and other manufacturers responded by filing suit challenging the 
constitutionality of the act, and were successful in getting a court order 
preventing Lungren from adding any new guns to the list until the issue was 
decided. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, a Sacramento Superior Court judge decided that the weapons act 
was constitutional, and last week the 3rd District Court of Appeals lifted the 
injunction allowing Lungren to proceed with expanding the list of banned 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Puglia, Lungren's spokesman, said the attorney general -- who is up for 
reelection this year -- has always been in favor of reasonable restrictions on 
gun ownership.

KILLER WAS FAN OF 'SPEED METAL' MUSIC OF ALIENATION, FRIENDS SAY; VIOLENCE: 
EXPERTS DISMISS ANY LINK BETWEEN THE AGGRESSIVE STYLE OF GROUPS SUCH AS PANTERA 
AND THE RAMPAGE THAT LEFT THE BOY, HIS FATHER AND AN OFFICER DEAD. 
</P>

<P>
 Ever since Metallica burst on the scene with its city-leveling sound 10 years 
ago, parents have alternately celebrated the wild freedom and denounced the 
forged-in-the-furnaces-of-Hell sounds of metal music. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as analysts sort through the wreckage and gore of Christopher Golly's 
short life, eyes are once again turning toward the metal culture that he 
drifted into at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends describe Christopher as a devotee of what is known as "speed metal" 
music, favoring one band called Pantera. According to experts, speed metal is 
virtually identical to thrash, and is a subgroup of heavy metal music. The 
difference between speed metal and the older metal bands such as Metallica is 
the staccato-like sound of the guitars, influenced as much by the English punk 
bands of the late 1970s as by the American heavy metal groups of the early 
'80s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disenfranchised youth that have problems are drawn to this kind of music," 
said Toni Isabella, a former assistant to deceased rock impresario Bill Graham 
and the onetime manager of Bay Area heavy metal band Exodus. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Times pop music writer Richard Cromelin agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of the punk tempo and some of the punk attitude," he said. 
"Maybe more so than in metal music itself it has an anger, alienation vibe to 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 This apparently was a vibe that Christopher found resonant with his own soul 
as conflicts with his father and disaffection with school worsened. Still, 
experts familiar with the speed metal subculture dismiss any possible link 
between violence and the music. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliot Cahn, a former manager of the band Testament, said killers such as 
Christopher "are very unhappy people from horrible families. The music of 
alienation comes very naturally to these kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher had been an indifferent student, first at Granada Hills High 
School, then at West Granada high, a continuation school where attempts to 
correct his truancy were unsuccessful. By the end of his life, the 17-year-old 
boy was doing schoolwork at home through an independent study program and had 
developed a daily habit of snorting crystal Methedrine, even selling some on 
the side. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike acid rock of the late '60s, according to Isabella, there is no specific 
drug connected to the speed metal culture. Though the racing rhythms of speed 
metal might seem to be a perfect match to the racing heartbeat and edgy nerves 
of a speed freak, Isabella said the explanation for Christopher's drug use is 
much simpler. 
</P>
<P>
 "Speed is a very popular drug with young people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher's drug of preference, apparently, was Pink Champagne, a form of 
speed named for its coloring that sells for $20 per quarter gram. 
</P>
<P>
 One adult who knew the boy at school said too much was being made out of 
Christopher's supposed descent into an urban subculture, blaming instead 
another common target for public outrage: the easy access to firearms at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think outside pressures had anything to do with it," said this 
person, who asked not to be identified. "His father kept all those damn guns in 
the house." 
</P>
<P>
 But friends said that after Christopher began getting high, he would sometimes 
talk crazy, and sometimes the talk would be about killing his father, Steven 
Golly, a Vietnam vet known as a disciplinarian. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thought about it a lot," said James Carieri, 18, a friend of Christopher. 
</P>
<P>
 The lifeblood of the speed metal subculture are the concerts: loud, 
non-melodious demonstrations featuring vocalists who one ex-manager said 
sometimes sound more like they are barking than singing. Down in the "moshing 
pit," according to this man, fans flail around and jump up on top of the mass 
of bodies to do what is called "crowd-surfing." 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of fans within the speed metal culture are young males. The 
dress is basic black and there are lots of tattoos and chains. In the past, 
satanic themes showed up in the music, but Cahn said the groups were rarely 
serious about the things they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Devil rhymes with revel the same way moon rhymes with June," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts said the metal subculture is basically a working class phenomenon, 
with politics a little to the right of center. Indeed, when the Gulf War was 
going on, Cahn received many letters from kids in foxholes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said Testament gave them hope," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The song lyrics are dramatically different from the sugary themes of sex and 
love that sustained the boys at the front in World War II. Instead, speed metal 
trades on anger, alienation, people who portray themselves as mad at society. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since Elvis shook his pelvis, people have worried that music with 
anti-Establishment and anti-parent themes exacerbates the natural alienation 
teen-agers feel as they grow up and leave home. Tipper Gore's campaign against 
obscenity and violent themes in rock music several years ago tapped into the 
same concern: that young people should not be exposed to violent, obscene 
material when they purchase music. She called music companies "cultural strip 
miners, profiting from the sex and violence and ignoring the scars." 
</P>
<P>
 But Isabella terms any linkage between the revolting act Christopher carried 
out with the music he listened to and the subculture he belonged to as 
"ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 "This music serves a purpose by allowing most people a good outlet" for their 
aggressive feelings, she said.

SANTA ANA OKS HOME-BUYER PLAN TO AID GRADUATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to bring role models back to the city's troubled neighborhoods, 
the City Council has approved a program to assist residents who have four-year 
college degrees in buying their first home. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ted R. Moreno said he devised the loans as a way to stem the city's 
brain drain, and encourage college-educated residents to give back to the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was looking for incentives to try to keep the kids here. A lot of the kids 
I went to high school with moved out of the city when they got a four- year 
degree," said Moreno, who was elected to the council in November, 1992, at age 
25. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess they thought, 'Now I'm educated. I deserve a better life.' But we 
need to try to keep those people here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members unanimously approved the Student Assisted Mortgage Program 
during Tuesday night's meeting.  
</P>
<P>
 The program will provide a maximum $30,000 loan toward a home and a possible 
incentive for students to finish high school and make it through four years of 
college, said Patricia C. Whitaker, the Community Development Agency's housing 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're struggling through those four years and saying, 'Is it really 
worth it?' Well, $30,000 toward your first home. . . . That might make it worth 
it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno and Whitaker said they do not know of any other similar program 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify, borrowers must have lived in Santa Ana when they were in high 
school, fall within a certain income level, meet normal loan requirements and 
pay a minimum 5% down payment on the home. The city then pays up to $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest on the loan does not start to accrue until the sixth year, and if 
Santa Ana's college-educated residents stick around for a decade, 50% of the 
loan will be forgiven in the 11th year, Whitaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They go to the Tustins, the Irvines and the Oranges, and kids here need those 
role models," Whitaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to send out notices about the program in upcoming water bills, 
and begin registering high school seniors this year who plan to go to college 
and express an interest, she said. Colleges in the area also will be notified 
of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker said $300,000 should be available for the program annually, enough 
for about 10 loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The program represents a "long-run solution to try to stabilize Santa Ana with 
college-educated residents," Moreno said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to see more of the children who grew up here and know the problems 
come back and work on those problems," he said. "The best role model, for a 
young Hispanic kid, is someone who's gone off to college and got educated." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said the program may offer Santa Ana's youth much-needed 
inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we can start promoting it to the kids, saying: 'Listen, your city is here 
to look after you. We're here to help you out to buy your first house,' " 
Moreno said. "That's the toughest American dream that can come true." 
</P>
<P>
 Community activist John Raya said he considered the program "a good gesture," 
but said other measures should be taken to ensure that Santa Ana offers a 
healthy business climate to young entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy for people who were going to stay here anyway to take advantage of 
it, but those who have a broader vision of where they're going, is this 
compelling enough for them to stay?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He approached the program with guarded skepticism, saying that few young 
professionals fresh from college would have enough income to qualify for home 
loans. "Ultimately people stay in a place because they believe it's a good 
place to be, they believe their concerns are being responded to," Raya said. "I 
don't know if trying to buy that level of faith is something you can do with a 
first-time home-buyer program." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker said her staff took a closer look at the recipients of another 
home-buying assistance program, the Community Development Agency's general 
Mortgage Assistance Program, and found that most were not college educated. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's fine. These are the people we should be helping, but we weren't 
getting those people who are upward bound, who were going into professional 
careers, who we need to go into our schools and talk to our kids," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 That program is for low-income residents, but they do not have to be 
first-time home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also authorized implementation of a third home-buyer program -- 
this one for first-time buyers -- using federal funds received in 1992. That 
money must be allocated by June of this year, Whitaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Housing Department will begin accepting applications for that 
program -- which is open to the general public, not just college-educated 
residents -- on March 5 at 500 W. Santa Ana Blvd., she said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials had to adapt the Mortgage Assistance Program in order to use 
the $500,000 in available federal funds, which require applicants to meet a 
stricter income standard and be first-time buyers to qualify, she said. Another 
$500,000 will come out of redevelopment funds. 
</P>
<P>
 About $1.1 million more in federal funds will be allocated by June for 
residents to bring their homes up to code, and for a joint project with Civic 
Center Barrio, a low-income housing group, Whitaker said.

HEARING SET ON TODDLER'S FATE; COURTS: JUDGE WILL RULE TODAY ON WHETHER TAJ 
JAYYUSI WILL REMAIN IN ORANGEWOOD OR BE RETURNED TO HIS FOSTER MOTHER. THE 
CHILD'S PARENTS REMAIN JAILED IN THE ABDUCTION.

<P>
 Four-year-old Taj Yaser Jayyusi's parents are locked away in jail for 
allegedly abducting him. He has a loving foster mother who wants him back. 
</P>
<P>
 So why has the child spent the last six days at the Orangewood Children's Home 
-- a county shelter for neglected and abused children who have nowhere else to 
go? 
</P>
<P>
 Children's Services Director Gene Howard said Wednesday that Taj was put in 
protective custody at Orangewood Saturday -- rather than returned to his foster 
mother -- because officials can't be sure others weren't involved in the Feb. 
12 abduction. Officials want to keep Taj at Orangewood and safe from a repeat 
kidnaping, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taj was taken Feb. 12 from foster mother Sue White's home in Rancho Santa 
Margarita just days before a court hearing to determine whether his parents 
would be stripped of their parental rights. Such a decision would allow Taj to 
be put up for adoption. According to Howard, White is seeking to adopt the 
child. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, an Orange County Juvenile Court judge is expected to rule on whether 
Taj will remain in Orangewood or be returned to his foster mother. Howard said 
Taj's biological parents, Yaser Majed Jayyusi, 55, and Deborah Ann Jayyusi, 35, 
will attend the proceedings under armed escort, then be returned to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 According to sheriff's officials, the child was snatched from a play area in 
the garage of White's home while she was taking a shower. Six days later, 
deputies who were staking out a business in Cerritos where Yaser Jayyusi worked 
arrested the couple when they arrived to pick up his check. Taj was with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Both parents were arrested on suspicion of child abduction and are being held 
in Orange County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time the child was recovered, we had no idea whether the parents were 
acting alone or in concert with friends or relatives," Howard said. "There was 
good reason to take some time and consider the circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard disclosed that Taj has relatives in Orange County, suggesting one 
possible placement option. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Deborah Ann Jayyusi appeared briefly in Municipal Court in 
Laguna Niguel, but her arraignment on felony charges was postponed. She is 
charged with taking Taj outside her court-assigned visitation period and 
violating Susan White's custody rights as a foster parent. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaser Jayyusi, who reportedly underwent a minor surgery, did not appear. He 
remained hospitalized Wednesday, jail officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taj and a 2-year-old daughter entered foster care two years ago after being 
taken from the Jayyusis because of allegations of physical abuse, according to 
social services officials and court records. The 2-year-old, who was at another 
foster care home until the kidnaping, was transferred to Orangewood because of 
concerns for her safety, Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Social services officials are seeking a foster parent who would be willing to 
take both children since state law requires that social workers keep siblings 
together when possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard ruled out the possibility that Taj would be returned to his parents' 
custody. According to court records, White complained to sheriff's deputies 
that "Yaser, who worked as a security guard and had access to guns, had 
threatened to kill anyone who tried to keep Taj away" from him.

SMILES ALL AROUND; UNUSUAL CAMERA TAKES 360-DEGREE GROUP SHOT OF 500 STUDENTS, 
STAFF AT CYPRESS COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 While Kornelius Schorle was setting up his Cyclo Pan 70 camera, said to be one 
of only 10 worldwide, the surrounding circle of about 500 Cypress College 
students, faculty and staff whiled away the 20-minute wait by doing the wave, 
cracking jokes and enjoying the Wednesday morning sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Some knelt on the damp grass, while others stood outside the circle, unsure 
whether to join in.  
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, get in the picture!" security guard Dan Nava urged a reluctant 
bystander. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Carnes, a student in auto mechanics, beckoned to two students sitting a 
safe distance away, but a nearby classmate wisecracked: "Naw, (the 
photographer) set the ugly people aside." 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of male drama students wore yellow dresses for the occasion, claiming 
"we always dress this way. We're theater students." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Jerry Burchfield, the college's photography instructor who arranged 
for the group portrait, admonished the crowd to stop the wave, and Schorle's 
camera spun slowly around on its tripod, capturing the images of the assembled 
students and staff. A few people hammed, and some hands still went up in the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 "One more time, and no waving this time!" Burchfield bellowed through a 
bullhorn. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few spins, the photo shoots were declared over, the crowd applauded, 
and everybody wandered away. 
</P>
<P>
 Said a gleeful Schorle: "We have it frozen in time." 
</P>
<P>
 Burchfield, who arranged for Schorle to take the 360-degree picture, hopes 
that the 16-inch-high by 50-foot-long print will capture a rare moment at 
Cypress College when people actually got together for something. 
</P>
<P>
 "A community college is made up of a community of people," he remarked. "We 
often lose sight of that." 
</P>
<P>
 The print, which will probably be delivered to the campus next week, will 
likely be displayed in the Theater Arts building, which also served as a 
backdrop for part of the picture. "We need a site with public access and a big 
wall," Burchfield said. "The only spot that seems appropriate is the lobby of 
the Theater Arts building." 
</P>
<P>
 Schorle, who specializes in panoramic photography and is the owner of the Long 
Skinny Picture Co. in Irvine, is donating the picture to Cypress College, which 
plans to sell smaller versions and T-shirts commemorating the event in the 
campus bookstore. Profits raised through the sales will be used to fund events 
that promote diversity at Cypress, said Burchfield, who has known Schorle for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Schorle has already done panoramic pictures for various Saddleback Valley 
Unified elementary schools, and Burchfield wanted one for Cypress College, a 
quiet community college of about 15,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a public activity to get people together and . . . give more life to 
the campus," the five-year Cypress College faculty member said. 
</P>
<P>
 Major group activities are not, apparently, something the campus is used to. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time I've seen a group picture," said Nava, as he edged in 
on the circle before the shoot began. The college is strict about class 
attendance, he said, "so many are still in class." 
</P>
<P>
 Burchfield, who had chosen Wednesday morning because more students were likely 
to be on campus, said he would have liked to have had a bigger turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if there were too many more, we'd have had trouble getting them all in 
the picture," he acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 John Reed, a Schorle assistant who helped him with the Cypress College 
picture, said they have taken panoramic pictures of as many as 850 people with 
the Cyclo Pan 70, which they said is one of only 10 in the world. Schorle has 
specialized in 360-degree photography for 20 years, selling to gift shops, 
overseas clients, and even doing prints of national parks, for the Port of Long 
Beach, and of airport sites for the Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way you can come back from a photo adventure with a conventional 
shot, a squatty picture, and say, 'This is what I saw,' " he said, noting that 
people prefer an "extended version -- what I saw with both eyes."

FILLET SANDWICH IS PLAINTIFF'S BONE OF CONTENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By E.J. GONG JR., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Claude Allan Hart, an unemployed truck driver, was eating a boneless McChicken 
sandwich at a McDonald's restaurant in Orange when he crunched on something 
hard. It was, according to Hart, a one-inch chicken bone that dislodged the 
right side of his jaw and caused a painful disorder that will require surgery 
to correct. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart, 42, sued the McDonald's franchise owner, the chicken patty manufacturer 
and the trucking company that delivered it, alleging negligence as well as a 
violation of the "expressed warranty" of a boneless sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
 All three companies refused to settle. So on Wednesday, the lawsuit went to 
trial in Orange County Superior Court and now it is up to a 12-member jury to 
decide the case of the chicken sandwich that bit back. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart's attorney, Johnna J. Hansen, is seeking $40,000 in medical expenses, 
along with compensation for pain and suffering she said her client has endured 
since the 1989 "chewing accident." 
</P>
<P>
 But the defendants say the allegations are all wrong. The attorney 
representing the restaurant's owner, Dunkleman Enterprises, and the patty-maker 
and the trucking company, said Hart suffered from a jaw ailment before he bit 
into the $1.99 sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Michael E. Wenzel told jurors that Hart's jaw problems were 
caused by years of dental neglect and that Hart had not visited a dentist for 
12 years before the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial, which is expected to include testimony from medical experts, Hart's 
former roommate and employees from the restaurant, is expected to last seven 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Lon Hurwitz, president of the Orange County Trial Lawyers Assn., said it is 
unusual for such a case to make it to trial.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's a need to analyze the propriety of taking these cases to full-blown 
trial because when it costs $4,000 a day to run a courtroom, you have to start 
determining whether the value of the case will exceed the cost to taxpayers and 
the attorneys involved," Hurwitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, trial is the last option "when one side feels they are dealing with 
an unreasonable opponent," Hurwitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute began Sept. 29, 1989, when Hart ordered his usual lunch of large 
fries, a chocolate milkshake and a McChicken sandwich at the McDonald's at 606 
N. Tustin Ave.  
</P>
<P>
 Hansen said the bone was hidden in the breaded chicken patty, and lodged 
vertically into Hart's jaw when he bit into it. The next day, his jaw was sore, 
swollen and made "popping and clicking sounds" whenever he opened it, Hansen 
told jurors during opening statements. Soon thereafter, she said, her client's 
ailment was diagnosed as temporomandibular joint dysfunction, a malfunctioning 
of the hinge mechanism in the jaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Hart said, he can only eat soft foods such as oatmeal, cereal and 
peanut butter on bread. He blames his slurred speech on the chicken bone and 
said he lost nearly 20 pounds because of poor eating habits. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a backup singer in a rock band, Hart said he can no longer carry a tune 
and suffers from frequent head and neck pains. He said he takes 10 Advil a day 
and cannot open his mouth wider than an inch without tremendous pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen said her client has accumulated $9,200 in unpaid medical bills and 
needs a $30,000 operation to fix his dislocated jaw. 
</P>
<P>
 But the defense attorney said the mishap could not have caused the damage that 
Hart described. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem was not aggravated or occasioned by biting down on a bone," 
Wenzel said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; OCTA SEEKS TO SWAP MEASURE M FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time, county transportation officials are proposing a major 
revision to Measure M highway funding due to a shortage of state tax dollars 
for the large, $1.6-billion Santa Ana Freeway widening project. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Transportation Authority officials said the agency's board will 
be asked Monday to approve a Measure M amendment, which would transfer about 
$208 million from other projects to the Santa Ana Freeway work. About $94 
million would come from the Costa Mesa Freeway widening north of the Garden 
Grove Freeway, and $114 million from the widening of the Riverside Freeway 
between the Orange Freeway and the Los Angeles County line. 
</P>
<P>
 The transfer would delay for about two to four years the projects on the Costa 
Mesa and Riverside freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reconstruction of Interstate 5 has been identified as the highest 
transportation priority in Orange County," states an OCTA staff report that 
supports the funding amendment. "A $3-billion shortfall in statewide 
transportation funding may now restrict funding for this project and delay its 
completion." The report noted that Orange County will not at this time receive 
a "commitment for additional state funding for construction of the remaining 
four projects" on the Santa Ana Freeway between the Garden Grove and Riverside 
freeways.  
</P>
<P>
 OCTA officials hope to swap Measure M dollars now for state funds later. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed change would have to be approved by a two-thirds vote of both the 
OCTA board and the Measure M Citizens Oversight Committee. Measure M was 
adopted by voters in 1990 and created a half-cent sales tax to be used for 
specific traffic improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Lawrenz Jr., a Newport Beach health care administrator who chairs the 
oversight committee, declined Wednesday to speculate on how controversial the 
proposed swap might be when it comes before his panel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all depends," Lawrenz said. "All our meetings are public, and so the 
public is going to have an opportunity to comment on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrenz said the committee was briefed about 90 days ago on the state's 
$3-billion shortfall in planned transportation expenditures. The shortages are 
being attributed mostly to recession-related reductions in state tax revenue.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; CHESSEN TO RUN FOR STATE SENATE SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Donna L. Chessen said Wednesday she will begin a run for the 
state Senate seat from the 34th District by entering the June 7 Democratic 
primary election. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe I've gone as far as I can as a city councilwoman in trying to 
convince Sacramento to give local government the essential tools and support to 
deliver essential services," said Chessen, who has served on the council for 
nine years. "I believe now is the time to go to Sacramento to make these 
effective changes." 
</P>
<P>
 Chessen, 56, said she will file nominating papers by the March 11 deadline and 
will not seek reelection to her council seat. Her term on that panel expires in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of redistricting, the 34th District now includes nearly all of 
central Orange County, including parts of Buena Park, Garden Grove, Santa Ana, 
Anaheim, Stanton, Westminster, La Palma, Orange, Fountain Valley and Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Chessen's only declared opponent so far is Wayman L. Nelson, a health care 
consultant from Santa Ana who has already turned in nominating papers, 
according to the county Registrar of Voters. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove), has said he will seek the Republican 
nomination from the 34th District. Hurtt currently represents the 32nd 
District, but the area has been re-designated as a result of reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Frank L. Adomitis of Anaheim, a certified public accountant who has 
already submitted nominating papers, will also run in the Republican primary. 
Another potential candidate is Libertarian Thomas E. Reimer, an engineer from 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Since she was elected to the council in 1985, Chessen said she has faced the 
challenge of balancing the city's shrinking budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned how to make tough decisions . . . that government can do the 
same for less while still providing quality service," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Chessen, who works as an office manager in her husband's chiropractic office, 
has hired campaign consultant Larry Sheingold Associates of Sacramento as well 
as a fund-raising team of Robert Kaplan Co. of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Last December, Chessen held a fund-raiser that netted $17,000. But Chessen 
said she needs to raise between $500,000 and $700,000 to run for the Senate. In 
comparison, Chessen said she raised about $37,000 for her last City Council 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Chessen is a 20-year resident of the city. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; LOOKING IN NEW PLACES FOR LEADERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A one-day leadership conference was held Wednesday to encourage 80 Costa Mesa 
High School students to become more active at school. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Ed Harcharik said the conference, called "Together We Can," is 
different from most other student development programs because it does not 
focus on students who are excelling. Typically, he said, leadership programs 
are held to teach the school's elected student leaders to be more effective in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 But not this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the kids are at risk, or are the really quiet kids who are never 
asked to participate," Harcharik said. "We're trying to get them involved in 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Scott-Hunnicutt, a motivational trainer from Sebastopol, broke the 
students into eight groups and led them in games during the morning -- to help 
develop friendships and improve relationships, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The students, who were nominated by teachers for the program, built castles 
out of playing cards and each group developed a short performance around the 
idea of "Together We Can." Many created humorous songs; one was to the tune of 
"The Brady Bunch" theme song. 
</P>
<P>
 During the afternoon, the students were scheduled to stay in groups to discuss 
peer pressure, drugs, racism, sex, teen pregnancy and other issues, 
Scott-Hunnicutt said. Students were to develop a skit at the end of the day to 
show what they learned in these discussions, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Imiguez, 17, said he enjoyed meeting people outside his group of friends. 
"Usually at school you just see people pass by and you don't say anything to 
them," said Imiguez. "Most of the things I learned (at the conference) are 
about making friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Imiguez, a 10th-grader, said he wants to improve his schoolwork and take part 
in more athletic programs. He now lifts weights at a community center and 
operates video cameras for "Living Room Dialogue," a community cable television 
show broadcast in English and Spanish. Imiguez said he would like to find work 
in television broadcasting after he graduates. 
</P>
<P>
 Laleh Vakili, 17, another student in Imiguez's group, agreed that the morning 
activities were a good opportunity to meet different types of students. 
Harcharik said he wants to create a school club for the students who took part 
in the workshop, so that they can continue to work together and help each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 The workshop, held at the Neighborhood Community Center, 1845 Park Ave., was 
funded by a federal grant, Harcharik said. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; HOLLY SEACLIFF SPECIAL DISTRICT REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BARKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week declined to form a special district that would have 
required landowners to help pay for street improvements and other public 
services to accommodate the $1-billion Holly Seacliff development. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry property owners claimed that the district would have unfairly forced 
them to pay about $10 million for public improvements that would benefit 
Seacliff Partners and the company's plans for nearly 4,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is taxation without representation," Connie Mandic told council members 
at their meeting Tuesday. "It's not done anywhere else. It's outrageous and 
highly discriminatory." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandic said she and her husband would have been assessed more than $400,000 
for three acres of undeveloped land in the proposed district had the district 
been approved. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Public Works Department, which recommended approval of the special 
reimbursement district, said its purpose was to provide reimbursement to 
Seacliff Partners for costs of improvements the company makes that would 
benefit other properties within the district boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners wouldn't have to pay the fee until they develop their property. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Holman, an official with a company that owns the land for the Holly 
Seacliff project, argued that other owners should be required to pay fees on a 
"fair-share basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Total costs for public improvements, including a new police and fire station, 
new streets, sewers and a water system, are estimated at $60.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Victor Leipzig said the reimbursement district would have been 
unfair to landowners. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a real change in policy to single out these property owners," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Holly Seacliff development takes up 460 of the 560 acres that would have 
been in the district. Individuals and companies own the other 100 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 When Seacliff Partners signed a development agreement with the city in 1990 to 
provide about $87 million in land dedications and improvements, city officials 
agreed to use their best efforts to obtain maximum reimbursable costs to 
Seacliff. 
</P>
<P>
 City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga told council members Tuesday night that 
he informed company officials at the time that there was a possibility that 
reimbursement "will not occur." 
</P>

 A 72-year-old time capsule discovered during construction of BJs Chicago 
Pizzeria on Main Street will be unveiled today when the eatery celebrates its 
grand opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers discovered the time capsule inside a copper box last month while doing 
seismic retrofitting at the two-story brick building that houses the 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The capsule, which contained old papers and photos, was placed below the 
building foundation in 1922 when the structure was built, said Paul Motenko, 
co-owner of BJs. 
</P>
<P>
 The time capsule will be on display beginning at 5 p.m., when the grand 
opening celebration gets underway. Mayor Gwen Forsythe will cut the 
restaurant's first slice of pizza at the event. BJs is at 209 Main St. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant will also be accepting items to be placed in a new time 
capsule. "We are looking for things that really represent the 1990s," Motenko 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new time capsule will be placed inside the building and is scheduled to be 
opened in 50 years. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; MEETING ON SALE OF CEMETERY TO BE HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A town meeting is scheduled for tonight in Garden Grove to allow residents to 
discuss the proposed sale of the Magnolia Memorial Park, a six-acre public 
cemetery that was founded in 1874. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents and civic groups have expressed concern that the deal, which 
would mark the first time in California history that a public cemetery has been 
sold to a private company, might disrupt the sanctity of the park's 1,000 
graves. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been a number of people who have had some worries, and this is a 
chance for them to get a better picture of what's going on," said Sam Randall, 
general manager of the Orange County Cemetery District, which maintains the 
county's public cemeteries. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents, among them Charles Everett of Fullerton, bristled at news of 
the proposed sale and wondered if they were going to have any chance to 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have several generations of family there and (my relatives and I are) very 
uneasy about the plans," Everett said. "If the sale in inevitable, we want to 
make sure there are protections in place for the park." 
</P>
<P>
 Everett and others said they are worried that mausoleums, crematories or other 
developments might mar the cemetery at 12241 Magnolia St. in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia Memorial Park, the smallest of the four sites controlled by the 
Cemetery District, costs $30,000 to maintain each year. The sale to the Omega 
Society of Santa Ana would relieve the cash-strapped district's budget, Randall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 During tonight's meeting, Cemetery District officials will explain the sales 
agreement and discuss the safeguards the district has in place to protect the 
park's future, Randall said. The proposal will go before the Board of 
Supervisors on March 1 for consideration.  
</P>
<P>
 The town meeting begins at 7 p.m. at the Garden Grove Community Center, 11300 
Stanford Ave. For more information, call the Orange County Cemetery District at 
(714) 951-9102. GEOFF BOUCHER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; 3 MEN CHARGED IN BANK-CARD SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Newport Beach police recently arrested three men and charged them with 
operating a bank-card scam out of a hotel room in Costa Mesa that may have 
netted them $100,000 in cash, said Sgt. Andy Gonis. 
</P>
<P>
 The men, Faheim Dawish, 23, possibly a resident of Costa Mesa, Donald 
Skenandore, 25, of Costa Mesa, and Victor Camarillo, 30, of Milwaukee, appeared 
in federal court Feb. 11 to face charges of counterfeiting, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The men are currently in custody at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los 
Angeles awaiting arraignment March 7. 
</P>
<P>
 The men were arrested Feb. 9 shortly after police stopped them for speeding in 
Newport Beach. During the traffic stop, police found credit cards and devices 
for counterfeiting or altering cards in the car, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Days later, police seized 500 automated teller machine cards, magnetic strips 
for altering the cards, a telescope, $20,000 in cash and two firearms during a 
search of a hotel room where at least one of the men was believed to be 
staying, Gonis said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to get a handle on the scope of this," Gonis said. "Losses are 
estimated to be at least $100,000." The Secret Service was asked to investigate 
because the case may involve counterfeiting of credit cards, a federal offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The three men allegedly used a telescope to stake out ATMs, Gonis said, adding 
that they allegedly watched bank customers typing in their secret access codes. 
</P>
<P>
 "When (bank) patrons leave behind their receipts, then (counterfeiters would) 
have all the information they need to encode a new card. We believe this is a 
big operation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are not sure how much money may have been taken by the group. 
Gonis said that the bank card operation may have targeted any number of banks 
in Orange County and that people who believe they might have been victimized 
should contact their bank.BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; CLUB GETS PUPILS INTO SCIENCE OF THINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 "Wow! Ours actually works!" 
</P>
<P>
 Fifth-grader Erin Rose was beaming. The small car topped with an aluminum foil 
sail that she and classmate Brittany Clements put together had just passed its 
initial test with flying colors. 
</P>
<P>
 When an electric fan was turned on, their "land yacht" caught the breeze and 
took off across the tile floor of Crown Valley Elementary's multipurpose room. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, after some review, 11-year-old Erin and 10-year-old Brittany thought 
about changing the design of the pocketlike sail they had made. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to do science," Erin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls were among 36 fifth-graders Tuesday who were getting an opportunity 
to learn scientific principles and concepts at a new after-school club 
introduced to the Capistrano Unified School District's elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Devised by an organization called Future Scientists and Engineers of America, 
the program is being used in other California school districts and was started 
at the district's Capistrano Valley High School in Mission Viejo a few years 
ago. But this is the first time that it has been tried at one of the district's 
elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18-week program, which began this month, was made possible through a 
$1,000 grant from Southern California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Watkins, a teacher and assistant principal at Crown Valley, said she hopes 
the program will prove successful so it can be expanded to other elementary 
schools in the district next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real hands-on program," Watkins said. "They're getting a chance to get 
in there and do it themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The club meets once a week for an hour after school and is led by Watkins and 
a mentor from the community. At Crown Valley that mentor is Alan Gray, a health 
physics supervisor for Southern California Edison at the San Onofre Nuclear 
Power Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the club's first meeting three weeks ago, Gray has been using the land 
yacht project to help the children learn about concepts such as friction and 
gravity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's actually a learning experience for me," said Gray, who was asked to 
volunteer by his daughter, Abby, a student in Watkins' class. "I'm learning as 
much as they are about this level of applied physics. I can run a reactor but 
I'm still learning about land yachts." 
</P>
<P>
 For the project, pairs of students were given a small block of wood with holes 
drilled in it, four wooden wheels, two long wooden sticks and two short ones, a 
foot-square piece of aluminum foil and tape. The students were to design their 
own land yachts using those parts. 
</P>
<P>
 They were given a few tips -- and this is where science came in -- on such 
things as sanding down wheels and axles to reduce friction, or positioning 
sails differently to catch the breeze. They also could paint the vehicles, if 
they desired. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the students put their creations through time trials. Next week 
they will have a contest to see whose goes farthest and fastest. 
</P>
<P>
 LaMar Toombs, training director for the Future Scientists and Engineers of 
America, said the program was started several years ago and is now in 80 Los 
Angeles and Orange County schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole reason for this (program) was borne out of the fact that we were 
concerned where our future scientists and engineers would be coming from," said 
Toombs, who worked the electric fan and gave advice to the children Tuesday. 
"For the next generation of scientists and engineers we had to get to the kids 
early on. Especially the girls and minority students, who have not tended to be 
exposed to these things." RICHARD CORE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; MAN HELD IN PHONE NUMBER 'CLONING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 21-year-old man described as a "computer whiz" by police has been arrested 
for allegedly "cloning" cellular telephone numbers, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathan A. Koval of Fountain Valley had allegedly devised a sophisticated and 
illegal method of obtaining free cellular telephone time with his computer, 
said police Sgt. Dann Bean. 
</P>
<P>
 "In his files, we found more than 50 telephone numbers that he's tried to 
clone," Bean said. "But it will take investigators weeks to determine the 
extent of the calls and the total cost." 
</P>
<P>
 Police estimate that Koval "cloned" at least $20,000 worth of calls, Bean 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators from the Fountain Valley Police Department, U.S. Secret Service 
and the Orange County Auto Theft Task Force began investigating Koval last 
month after receiving a tip. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from PacTel Cellular in Irvine met with police Wednesday to 
study Koval's paperwork. They looked up several accounts listed among Koval's 
records, Bean said, and determined that customers had reported numbers 
improperly charged to these accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Police allege that Koval conducted the "cloning" from the home he shares with 
his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Koval is also suspected of conducting a telemarketing scheme. Police said he 
may have used his computer to obtain names and phone numbers of potential 
victims and allegedly would "call them and tell them they won $50,000." 
</P>
<P>
 "Then he would say that they would have to send him a money order for several 
hundreds of dollars in order for them to claim their prize," Bean said. 
</P>
<P>
 Koval is being held on $10,000 bail at Huntington Beach Jail on suspicion of 
possessing stolen property, telephone and mail fraud, and "cloning" cellular 
telephone numbers. GREG HERNANDEZ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; CSUF PROF WINS COPPER PROJECT GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dr. Maria Linder, a Cal State Fullerton biochemistry professor, is accustomed 
to receiving grants for her research on copper and iron in the body.  
</P>
<P>
 In her 17 years at Cal State Fullerton, she has won more than $2 million in 
research grants from organizations including the National Institutes of Health, 
the National Science Foundation and the American Heart Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she conceded, "it's much harder than it used to be" to receive research 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 So, it was with a sense of "relief" that she learned of a newly awarded 
$100,000 grant from the National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
 Linder, 55, received the Shannon Award, named for former NIH Director Dr. 
James A. Shannon, for her research on how copper and iron is transported to a 
fetus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found a protein (ceruloplasmin) we thought was only in blood plasma. But 
it is also found in amniotic fluid, breast milk and cerebral spinal fluid -- 
the brain is producing it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Too much copper in a baby's intestine can cause colic, a common digestive 
problem that affects infants between 1 and 3 months old, Linder said. But the 
ceruloplasmin protein may prevent copper from reaching the baby's intestine. If 
so, it could be used in baby formulas in the future, Linder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Linder is also researching the effects of iron on heart disease and cancer, 
and how the body stores it in the blood. She hopes to get more funding for that 
project.  
</P>
<P>
 Linder, who earned undergraduate and graduate degrees from Harvard University 
and then did postdoctoral work at Harvard and MIT, won the 1993 American 
Chemical Society Award for Research at an Undergraduate Institution, her 
previous major award. She has been involved with copper and iron research since 
the late 1960s. She also won an outstanding professor of the year award in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really nice working with her," said graduate student Philip Cerveza, one 
of the six students working with her on the copper project. "She's always there 
to challenge us to solve the problem." AILEEN CHO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; STUDENTS UPSET OVER SCHOOL DENIAL OF CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of Esperanza High School students are angry about the school's refusal 
to allow them to form a chapter of MEChA (Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de 
Atzlan), a student organization that focuses on Chicano culture and history. 
</P>
<P>
 Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District officials say allowing the 
organization would violate its closed-forum policy, which permits only those 
clubs that are directly related to the curriculum. The district adopted the 
policy in October, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lupe Lopez, president of Golden West College's MEChA chapter, who is 
advising the Esperanza students, said the fact that the school doesn't include 
Latino history and culture in its curriculum should not be used against the 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chicano history isn't taught in the high school," Lopez said. "If it were, 
MEChA would" qualify as being directly related to the curriculum.  
</P>
<P>
 District trustees were addressed Tuesday night by Lopez and Esperanza senior 
Grace Lopez, who is not related. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't just Hispanic students" who want MEChA, Grace Lopez said. "Other 
students want to know what Aztecs and Esperanza are all about."  
</P>
<P>
 The school's athletic teams are named for the Aztecs, the native Mexican 
civilization that flourished in the 15th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon McHolland, the district's assistant superintendent for instructional 
services, said MEChA is not considered curriculum-based even though the 
district's social science and language classes include aspects of Latino 
history and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our curriculum (in those classes) embraces all cultures," McHolland said. 
"MEChA would be based on just a narrow part of that curriculum." 
</P>
<P>
 But teachers from several other county high schools say MEChA, which 
emphasizes community service, can be considered curriculum-based. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time students (in a club) are doing good in the community, that club can 
be tied to the curriculum," said Frank Thompson, a history teacher and MEChA 
adviser at La Habra High School in the Fullerton Joint Union High School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 Javier Rivera, an industrial arts teacher and MEChA adviser at Katella High 
School in the Anaheim Union High School District, said MEChA is 
curriculum-based at least as much as football, cheerleading or other athletic 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stress higher education," Rivera said. "We encourage students to get 
through high school, then pursue at least a bachelor's degree."  
</P>
<P>
 Even if the club isn't considered curriculum-based, both advisers said, MEChA 
does benefit students academically. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every student benefits from associating with other students in the same 
special interest areas," Thompson said. "Students who feel good about 
themselves perform better." 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza student Eddie De La Torre said MEChA would help keep students in 
school by giving them something to identify with outside of class. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would give more of a reason to go to school," he said. "Like some football 
players only go to school so they can play. That's their reason for staying in 
school. Well, MEChA (would be) my reason." DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; COUNCILWOMAN PUTS SEAT UP FOR GRABS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Eileen Krause, one of the city's original five council 
members, has announced she won't seek reelection in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Krause, 50, a resident of Monarch Bay, was first elected in 1988 before the 
community was incorporated. Krause made her intentions known Tuesday night at a 
City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided it made sense to announce it now so people could start thinking 
about running," Krause said Wednesday, adding that she believed it was time for 
new council faces. "I think new people will add some fresh blood and energy, 
which is good. But we will always have overlap of council members to give the 
city continuity." 
</P>
<P>
 Krause is one of three council members whose seats expire in June. 
Councilwoman Karen Lloreda is expected to run for reelection, and Councilman 
Mike Eggers, another member of the city's first council, will make his 
intentions known March 8 but is not expected to enter the race. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said Krause's announcement is certain to lure more candidates 
into what is expected to be a wide-open race. 
</P>
<P>
 "It definitely opens up the field because there are people out there who don't 
like to run against incumbents," Eggers said. "Also, if it turns out there are 
two open seats, it will make the race very different. The lone incumbent will 
be the only person to defend the city . . . and it's easier to criticize than 
praise." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman William L. Ossenmacher agreed, saying, "If you have a couple of 
seats open, people might think they have a better shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Krause, who owns a Santa Ana-based company that cleans and services air 
pollution equipment, thought it was a good time to step down because she had 
"accomplished what I wanted" on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially, even before cityhood, I wanted to make sure Monarch Beach became a 
part of Dana Point," Krause said. "Then I wanted to help the city incorporate, 
meld the three former communities together and set up a city that is 
functioning well. I think these are lofty goals and are major accomplishments." 
</P>
<P>
 If Eggers indeed does not run, that would leave Mayor Judy Curreri as the only 
remaining member of the original council. LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: VILLA PARK; HIGHER RATES CITED IN FUND TRANSFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members this week voted to transfer about $584,000 of the city's 
reserve funds in a state account to a county account for more interest 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 The city currently has $834,000 in a state-run investment fund, the Local 
Agency Investment Fund, which gives the city a 4.4% interest earning 
annually.When city officials transfer the money to a county-run investment 
fund, Villa Park will receive 7.8% interest annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has $517,000 in the county account and with the additional money, 
city officials anticipate making about $5,000 in interest by June. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no intention of risking any of this city's modest reserve account, 
nor do we have the resources to bring aboard anyone to make such investments," 
Councilman Bob Patchin said. "It takes time and skill to manage money well and 
we have neither at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the money in the state account will be transferred to the county 
account within days and that all the interest earned will go into the city's 
general fund to pay for street improvements and other similar projects. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said about $250,000 has to stay in the state investment fund 
because that money can be withdrawn at any time. Money in the county account 
would take seven to 30 days to be withdrawn. MIMI KO

FELONY ASSAULT CHARGED IN ATTACK ON VOLLEYBALL TEAM; VIOLENCE: THEIR VAN WAS 
SMASHED AND AN ATHLETE'S ARM WAS BROKEN. TWO BROTHERS ARE ACCUSED IN THE FEB. 
11 INCIDENT.

<P>
 One of two brothers arrested on suspicion of attacking a van full of 
volleyball players and breaking one of the athlete's arms was arraigned 
Wednesday on felony assault charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Delatorre, 18, and his 19-year-old brother Armando Delatorre were 
arrested Saturday morning at their Santa Ana home, Costa Mesa Police Sgt. Neil 
Leveratt said. 
</P>
<P>
 They were accused of taking part in the Feb. 11 beating of nine volleyball 
players from Palomar College in San Diego County, police said. The players had 
stopped in Costa Mesa about 8:30 p.m. on their way home from a tournament in 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "They thought Long Beach was too dangerous to eat there so they decided to go 
to Costa Mesa," Leveratt said. "That was bad luck on their part." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Burger King restaurant, 3150 Harbor Blvd., the suspects and another 
youth apparently mistook the volleyball players for rival gang members, 
Leveratt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three suspects allegedly used a metal crutch and a wooden club to smash in 
the windows of the van, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Armando Delatorre allegedly broke the arm of Sean Thomas, 18, of San Diego, 
according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Paer. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, officers served search warrants in Santa Ana and Costa Mesa, 
Leveratt said. In Costa Mesa, they arrested Tony Henriquez, 20, on suspicion of 
being the third accomplice in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Henriquez was later released for lack of evidence, Paer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Delatorre pleaded not guilty Wednesday to four felony assault 
charges, and his preliminary hearing was scheduled for March 7, Paer said. 
Armando Delatorre was scheduled to be arraigned March 21.

RILEY TO UNDERGO SURGERY TO CORRECT PINCHED NERVES; ILLNESS: SPINAL OPERATION 
IS INTENDED TO RELIEVE SEVERE PAIN IN LEGS OF BOARD OF SUPERVISORS CHAIRMAN. HE 
IS EXPECTED TO BE IN HOAG HOSPITAL FROM THREE TO SIX DAYS.

<P>
 Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley is scheduled to undergo spinal 
surgery today at Hoag Hospital to relieve the severe leg pain that his doctors 
attribute to pinched nerves in his lower back. 
</P>
<P>
 The 81-year-old politician returned to the Newport Beach hospital Wednesday 
afternoon, just two months after he was admitted for treatment of a foot 
infection, said Christie McDaniel, his chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-hour surgery will begin at 7:30 a.m., and McDaniel said an early 
estimate of the hospital recovery was three to six days. 
</P>
<P>
 McDaniel said Wednesday that Riley has weathered agony in recent months 
because of the pinched nerves, which have sporadically sent sharp jolts of pain 
through his legs. In recent weeks, the pain's frequency began to increase, most 
recently striking when he put even the slightest weight on his legs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't really notice it too much because with his foot problem, he wasn't 
using his legs anyway, he was in the wheelchair," McDaniel said. "But then as 
he started recovering and using his legs more, he started complaining more and 
more." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley underwent magnetic resonance imaging last week, a scan that pinpointed 
nerves in his lower back as the likely culprit behind the discomfort, McDaniel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley's wife, Emma Jane Riley, said Wednesday: "There is certainly an element 
of risk and he's aware of that. We have a fine neurologist, and we have the 
utmost confidence in our doctors." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley, a retired Marine Corps general, has represented the 5th District on the 
board since his 1974 appointment by then-Gov. Ronald Reagan. Riley, now serving 
as chairman of the board, has announced that he will retire when his term 
expires next year. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Riley has weathered a series of maladies. 
</P>
<P>
 The infection of his left foot, an inflammation of the soft tissue called 
cellulitis, left him hobbled for more than a month and, during December, 
undergoing antibiotic and whirlpool bath treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 He was hospitalized for several days just before Christmas because doctors 
feared the infection could spread to his bloodstream.  
</P>
<P>
 Riley was checked into Hoag twice in 1992 for observation because of concerns 
linked to his diabetic condition. During one of those stays, doctors discovered 
that he suffered from bronchitis. For years he has had emphysema and asthma, 
and in 1991 he underwent quadruple bypass heart surgery.

CITY TO STUDY COSTS OF MUNICIPAL LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Council members considering pulling away from the county library system asked 
the city staff Wednesday to look more closely at the costs of running a 
municipal library. 
</P>
<P>
 If the city ran its own library, "at least the community could decide for 
itself what level of service it wants," Councilman Robert D. Breton said at a 
council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 A decision to separate from the 27-branch library system would be 
unprecedented in the county, county library officials say. Since Mission Viejo 
began looking into seceding from the county system, several other cities have 
expressed interest, City Manager Fred Sorsabal said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out of those in the O.C. library system, there are four (cities) who have 
talked to me about what we're doing," Sorsabal said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials referred constantly Wednesday night to a recently issued 
consultant's report that they said confirmed many criticisms and suspicions 
that they had harbored about the local county branch. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the conclusions made in the report: 
</P>
<P>
 * The 9,155-square-foot library, which serves about 106,000 residents of 
Mission Viejo and parts of surrounding communities such as Laguna Hills, is 
severely undersized. The branch is twice as congested as county standards allow 
and five times more crowded than recommended in state library guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mission Viejo residents have been charged $4.5 million in special district 
taxes since 1988 that city officials say should have been used to build a new 
library. The Orange County Board of Supervisors chose instead to use the money 
to support the county firefighting system. 
</P>
<P>
 * Local taxpayers also contributed about $1 million in property taxes that is 
earmarked for the local library branch, which only costs about $800,000 to 
operate. County library officials dispute those figures in the report, saying 
the Mission Viejo branch ran a loss of about $200,000 in fiscal year 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the city spent $2.5 million to purchase land at La Paz Road and 
Marguerite Parkway for a new library, but a $5-million construction bond failed 
to win approval from voters. Since then, the city and an independent library 
committee have failed to find new sources of funding for the planned 
25,000-square-foot library. 
</P>
<P>
 County Librarian John Adams says the county is no longer responsible for 
building libraries in communities that have incorporated. The county would 
contribute proceeds from the sale of the current library building -- about $1 
million -- but will not commit any more funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Since receiving word of the report's conclusions, council members have come to 
believe that the city can do a better job of running the library. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members were still cautious about committing to leaving the county 
system. More research is needed to make certain that taxes are enough to run 
the library, council members said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt that the five of us want a new library," Councilman William 
S. Craycraft said. "The challenge will be funding it." 
</P>
<P>
 And even if the books balance, getting the county to turn over the tax 
revenues earmarked for the local library could be a long and complicated 
process. A legal report issued last week by City Atty. Peter M. Thorson was 
inconclusive about the city's legal rights to the library tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Thorson said it would take about five months to complete the process of 
separating from the county.

ELEPHANT POACHING DOWN, CONSERVATIONIST SAYS; WILDLIFE: RICHARD LEAKEY TELLS 
UCI AUDIENCE THAT ANIMALS' FUTURE IS STILL TROUBLED AS GROWING POPULATION PUTS 
STRESS ON AFRICA'S LIMITED PARKLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kenyan wildlife conservationist Richard Leakey said Wednesday at UC Irvine 
that poaching of elephants has declined dramatically in Africa, but other 
problems continue to face the giant mammals. 
</P>
<P>
 From a rate of more than 3,000 a year in the mid-1980s, poaching has declined 
to less than 50 a year today, Leakey said. Pressures from growing human 
populations, however, cloud the animals' future. 
</P>
<P>
 Leakey, 49, has found both celebrity and controversy in each of his public 
careers, as a conservationist who helped establish a worldwide ban on the sale 
of ivory, and as a paleo-anthropologist whose inquiries into the origins of 
humankind have extended the pioneering work of his parents, famed fossil 
hunters Louis and Mary Leakey. 
</P>
<P>
 The past year has been difficult for Leakey. Last June, a small plane he was 
piloting crashed outside Nairobi. His lower legs were crushed, and both were 
later amputated below the knee and he was later fitted with prosthetics. On 
Wednesday, he walked to the podium without the aid of a cane, and said in a 
brief interview before the lecture that he is "doing very well."  
</P>
<P>
 Political troubles have followed his physical setbacks. Last month, he 
tendered his resignation as head of the Kenya Wildlife Service, a post he has 
held since 1989. Senior government officials had accused him of corruption and 
mismanagement, charges he vehemently denied at the time of his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Donor organizations (including the World Bank), international conservation 
groups and Kenyan tour operators have come to Leakey's defense. The resignation 
has been characterized as an ultimatum to Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi to 
back Leakey or fire him, but Moi has yet to act. 
</P>
<P>
 Leakey's 1989 appointment to the Kenya Wildlife Service was a surprise to 
many, but he pursued the job aggressively. He instituted a shoot-to-kill order 
to fight poachers, sought to curb corruption with widespread firings in the 
wildlife agency, and led the call for the worldwide ivory ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of his methods have been criticized, both within Kenya and 
internationally, but he has numerous supporters throughout the conservation 
community. In his own defense, Leakey points to the bottom line: Since his 
appointment in 1989, elephant poaching in Kenya has been virtually eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 In his talk, Leakey attributed the decline in poaching largely to a shift in 
public sentiment against the use of ivory. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebounding elephant populations are putting increased pressures on limited 
parkland in Kenya and elsewhere, leading to complex management problems, Leakey 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Overall, however, Kenya has "turned a negative situation into a positive 
situation," Leakey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leakey was born in Nairobi, Kenya, in 1944 and often accompanied his parents 
as they worked at Tanzania's Olduvai Gorge, where they made startling fossil 
discoveries in the late 1950s and through the 1960s. Louis died in 1972, but 
Mary continues to work in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Leakey made his first fossil discovery, the skull of an extinct pig, 
at age 6, but later vowed not to follow in his parents' footsteps and became a 
safari guide. 
</P>
<P>
 However, at age 23 and largely untrained, he started an excavation at Koobi 
Fora, near the shores of Lake Turkana in northern Kenya, and uncovered an 
extremely rich trove of early human remains. Perhaps the most significant find 
was the so-called "Turkana Boy" in 1984. About 1.5 million years old, it is by 
far the most complete skeleton ever discovered of Homo erectus, widely accepted 
as the most immediate ancestor to modern humans, Homo sapiens. 
</P>
<P>
 His interpretations of the human fossil record have sometimes put him at odds 
with colleagues in the anthropological field, but then he is no stranger to 
controversy. He has outlined his discoveries and theories in several books, 
most recently "Origins Reconsidered," published in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Leakey has not actively pursued anthropology since his appointment to the 
wildlife position in Kenya, but his wife Meave is a paleontologist with the 
National Museums of Kenya.

STATE PARKS OFFICIAL INVESTIGATED FOR SMOG-CHECK FRAUD; PROBE: MAINTENANCE 
CHIEF FOR 11 SITES IN ORANGE AND SAN DIEGO COUNTIES ALLEGEDLY USED PUBLIC MONEY 
TO PAY FOR INSPECTIONS THAT WEREN'T MADE. NO CHARGES HAVE BEEN FILED.

<P>
 State officials are investigating allegations that an Orange County-based 
parks official used state money to buy smog checks for state vehicles that 
apparently were never inspected. 
</P>
<P>
 In a search-warrant affidavit filed last month in Riverside County Municipal 
Court, state investigators alleged that David V. Gallardo, maintenance chief 
for 11 state parks in the Orange Coast district in Orange and San Diego 
counties, paid a Riverside garage to issue smog-check certificates for at least 
10 vehicles that officials said were never tested. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallardo, 39, of Riverside declined to comment Wednesday. Officials with the 
state Department of Parks and Recreation also declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 No charges have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Consumer Affairs' Bureau of Automotive Repair, which 
oversees the investigation, is expected to hand its case over to the Riverside 
district attorney's office this week or early next week. Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Mark McDonald, who will handle the case, said the allegations against Gallardo 
are unusual and "ironic." 
</P>
<P>
 "I had never heard of anything like this before," McDonald said Tuesday. 
"California is trying to bring its smog level down to federal compliance. And 
in this case, it's the state's vehicles that are not meeting current standards 
and are out there polluting the sky." 
</P>
<P>
 In the affidavit, state investigators allege that Gallardo, along with owners 
of two Riverside garages, were involved in a "conspiracy . . . for the purpose 
of defrauding the state of California out of public monies." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the charges that investigators will ask McDonald to consider are 
embezzlement, falsification of records by a public officer, entering false data 
into the state's computer system, perjury and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not clear how much of the state money Gallardo paid to the garage for 
inspections that were never performed, McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators allege that Gallardo issued state checks to H & H Smog and 
Tune-Up Center of Riverside -- and allegedly received kickbacks for them -- to 
pay for smog inspections and repairs that were never done. Gallardo is 
authorized to issue checks, drawn from the district's purchase-voucher fund, of 
up to $500 to pay for maintenance and operation of the parks in the Orange 
Coast district, which includes Crystal Cove, Huntington and Doheny state 
beaches.  
</P>
<P>
 Investigators were tipped to the alleged scheme last September when an 
employee with the state Parks and Recreation Department provided them copies of 
invoices and vehicle mileage logs showing discrepancies between the records 
kept by H & H and the Orange Coast district. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the affidavit reported, state computer records, as entered by H & 
H, show that a 1988 Dodge truck owned by the Orange Coast district underwent 
smog testing at 3:14 p.m. on May 25, 1993. The confidential informant gave 
investigators state mileage logs that recorded the same truck as being at a San 
Diego County beach at the time, the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records, the informant also provided records to show that 
Gallardo signed checks to pay for smog checks and repair on at least 10 state 
cars. The state mileage logs showed that the cars were elsewhere during the 
purported inspections logged in H & H records. 
</P>
<P>
 The affidavit also stated that the informant told investigators H & H was 
provided a parks and recreations document that lists the mileage, license 
plate, year and make of each vehicle under the jurisdiction of the Orange Coast 
district.

CANDIDATE SAYS FOE OFFERED HIM BRIBE TO PULL OUT OF RACE; DEMOCRATS: ZEKE 
HERNANDEZ SAYS TED MORENO OFFERED SANTA ANA COUNCIL CAMPAIGN FUNDS IF HE WOULD 
ABANDON RUN FOR 69TH ASSEMBLY SEAT. MORENO DENIES CLAIMS.

<P>
 A Democratic candidate in the 69th Assembly District race filed a complaint 
Wednesday with the Orange County district attorney's office and the grand jury, 
claiming that one of his opponents in the June primary tried to force him out 
of the race through bribery and intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
 During a news conference at the county Hall of Administration, candidate Zeke 
Hernandez alleged that Santa Ana Councilman Ted R. Moreno told a third party 
that he had "a group of attorneys that would raise $10,000" for Hernandez to 
run for the Santa Ana City Council instead of the Assembly seat being vacated 
by Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez said he was filing the complaint because he did not believe 
"politics as usual" should be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
 "When somebody does something like that, it does not matter if he or she is 
Latino or Anglo or African American. Something like this shouldn't occur," 
Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a later interview, Moreno said he never offered Hernandez, or any 
intermediary, campaign funds to get Hernandez out of the Assembly race. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had attorneys that would give $10,000, don't you think I am going to use 
it for my campaign?" Moreno said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing to Hernandez's four previously unsuccessful City Council campaigns, 
Moreno said he would never offer Hernandez's campaign financial support 
"because he is a weak candidate. . . . I would lose credibility in the 
community by endorsing him." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez identified the third party as political activist Arturo Montez, who 
later confirmed that Moreno had approached him with the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 County prosecutors could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Democratic Party Chairwoman Dorianne Garcia said that if 
Hernandez has evidence to substantiate his charge, then he has the right to 
file a complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am hoping that this was all a misunderstanding between Zeke and Ted," she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Hernandez and Moreno, the Democratic field in the 69th Assembly 
District race includes Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce President Michael Metzler 
and Santa Ana contractor John Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez also released a tape recording of a Feb. 14 telephone conversation 
between himself and Moreno, two days before the campaign funds were allegedly 
offered to the intermediary. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno is heard on the tape urging Hernandez to do "what's best for the 
(Latino) community" and let Moreno be the Latino candidate in the June 7 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
 If both Latinos stay in the race, Moreno argues on the tape, a white candidate 
will be guaranteed victory in the heavily minority district that includes 
Anaheim, Garden Grove and Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno, who said he did not know the telephone conversation was being 
tape-recorded, described it as a "heart-to-heart" talk. "If Zeke cannot handle 
running with the big boys, then he should get out of the race," he said.

STUDENT ALLEGEDLY HIT AT ENTRANCE TO MEETING; INQUIRY: YOUTH SAYS TEACHER 
STRUCK HIM AS HE TRIED TO JOIN GATHERING OF SUPPORT GROUP FOR GAYS. INSTRUCTOR 
DENIES IT.

<P>
 A 17-year-old student has alleged that a teacher assaulted him last week as he 
tried to attend a meeting of a support group for gay students at Fountain 
Valley High School, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged confrontation happened Feb. 17 as the Student Alliance was about 
to begin a meeting after school, police Sgt. Dann Bean said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The group was meeting and apparently the student wanted to attend the meeting 
and there was some problem with letting him into the room," Bean said. "The 
student is claiming that he was hit in the face with the teacher's forearm." 
</P>
<P>
 The student, whose name was not released, filed an assault-and-battery report 
with the Fountain Valley Police Department that evening. Bean said the teacher 
denied the charge to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley High School Principal Gary Ernst said Wednesday that the 
campus administration also received a complaint from the student and are 
investigating the allegation. He declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
 Bean said he has not yet interviewed the student but that he apparently is not 
a member of Student Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, which has gained formal status, sparked months of politically 
charged debate between supporters and those opposed to allowing it to meet on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the Huntington Beach Union High School District Board of Trustees 
voted to keep a district policy that allows student groups not related to the 
curriculum -- such as the gay and lesbian alliance and Bible study groups -- to 
hold meetings on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, a group of about 20 Huntington Beach High School teen-agers formed 
a support group for gay and lesbian students on the campus.

JR. WALKER'S STILL RIDING 'SHOTGUN'; POP MUSIC: THE ARTIST, WHOSE HONEST, 
DOWN-HOME STYLE OF RHYTHM AND BLUES HAS LONG PROPELLED HIM DOWN A LESS-TRAVELED 
ROAD, PLAYS TONIGHT AT THE COACH HOUSE.

 Jr. Walker always was an anomaly at Motown Records -- blacker, funkier, 
greasier, more rooted in traditional R&B than in the high-gloss stylizations of 
such Motown superstars as the Supremes, the Miracles and the Temptations. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Motown acts evoked mental images of silk tuxedos, polished Italian shoes 
and Hollywood glitter. Walker's honking tenor sax and raucous, down-home vocals 
brought to mind bubbling pots of chitlins, wild rent parties and Dixie Peach 
Pomade. 
</P>
<P>
 So perhaps it's not surprising that Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Smokey 
Robinson and the others have enjoyed fruitful, productive careers post-Motown 
while Walker has faded into the background. His record releases, few and far 
between, have gone unnoticed among all but the hard-core faithful. 
</P>
<P>
 He was born Autry DeWalt in rural Arkansas. His press biography lists 1942 as 
his year of birth, although during a recent phone interview from a hotel room 
in Washington, D.C., he claimed to be 58 years old. Like his music, his 
personality and outlook on life remain rooted in the simple values he grew up 
with. Polite and good-natured, he nonetheless is a man of few words, to the 
point that he refuses to install a telephone at his home. 
</P>
<P>
 He was inspired to take up the tenor sax during the '50s, a golden era of R&B 
honkers, shouters and screamers. The sound and style of the time still 
reverberate in his music. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was listening to all the tenor players," he recalls. "I had some stuff on 
Earl Bostic; he was blowing some nice stuff back in those days. Also Illinois 
Jacquet, Lester Young and all those people. Boots Randolph, I really liked him. 
'Yakety Sax' is really what got me interested in playing. You can't find 
records by them anymore. I go to see what can I dig up in record stores, but 
there's nothing there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Walker played in his high school's marching band and turned pro at age 16 when 
he joined a local group called the Jumping Jacks. The band settled in Battle 
Creek, Mich., became Jr. Walker and the All Stars, and recorded a handful of 
singles for the small Harvey label in Detroit before hooking up with Motown 
mogul Barry Gordy, who placed the group on his Soul subsidiary label in 1964. 
"Shotgun," released early the following year, became a smash hit, the song with 
which Walker remains most associated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people still want me to play the old hits, man. If I do something new, 
they like it, but they want to hear mostly the old songs. I'm doing mostly the 
same thing anyway, but now I've got a couple of girls singing with me." 
</P>
<P>
 He seemed oblivious to most trends in modern music and wasn't even aware that 
Los Lobos recently recorded a cover version of "Shotgun." But he did have a 
word or two to say about the state of rhythm & blues in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of them have got off into too much rap, and that's taking away from it. 
That doesn't get enough music to me; they don't get enough feeling in it. We're 
gonna see if we can come back strong and put the feeling back in." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He said he and the current lineup of All Stars have been in the studio 
wrapping up an album that he wants to release this summer. But -- as he is with 
most subjects -- Walker was hesitant to talk too much about the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're gonna go ahead and put it back where it belongs, put it back on top," 
he said. "At least we're gonna try. I've got a plan I'm gonna start this 
summer. Everybody wants to know what it is, but I don't want to say too much 
about it. I'll just lay back and do it. When you tell people what you're up to, 
everybody'll jump on it and do what you say you're gonna do." 
</P>
<P>
 * Jr. Walker and the All Stars, the John Huessenstamm Band and the Topy Fiske 
Experience play tonight at the Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan 
Capistrano, starting at 8. $16.50. (714) 496-8930.

POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM: THE PUZZLE OF ELI RIDDLE; WHAT YOU DON'T HEAR IS 
BLUSTER, BUT THE MUSIC IS CATCHY, MELODIC 
</P>

<P>
 How could a reserved pawnbroker with no taste for theatrics or 
self-dramatization be responsible for some of the most vibrant rock music ever 
to come out of Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the enigma posed by Eli Riddle and its leader, Jon Melkerson. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking his very reticence as a core theme for his philosophically inclined 
songwriting, the 29-year-old Westminster resident has been a main cog in the 
creation of three excellent albums over the past five years. Two were by his 
previous band, Eggplant. Now comes "Eli Riddle," the much-delayed but deeply 
satisfying debut from the band that sprouted from Eggplant nearly three years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Tall, with a long face, a receding hairline and the stubble of a barely 
sprouted Vandyke ringing his chin, Melkerson looks a bit like a younger version 
of Richard Thompson. His talents parallel those of the great British musician, 
one of the few triple-threat rockers: He can write involving songs, sing them 
effectively and drive them home with electrifying guitar leads. 
</P>
<P>
 Melkerson writes with a fine ear for catchy riffs and melodic hooks, and an 
understanding of how to build dynamic, shifting song structures -- something he 
shares with one of his key influences, Tom Verlaine, the New York City 
underground rock guitar hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Melkerson's singing is steady and tuneful with a circumspect cast ideally 
suited to the central tensions in his songs. It's with the guitar that 
Melkerson is best able to break through the restraints of a reserved 
temperament and speak with emotional force in a cascade of freely ranging but 
cannily harnessed notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these abilities, and a five-year track record of steady local gigging, 
Melkerson and Eli Riddle remain one of the least appreciated, smallest-drawing 
bands on the local alternative rock scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Quiet wheels don't get a lot of grease in Orange County, where the biggest 
acts typically have featured a hammering punk sound, flamboyant stage presence, 
or a striking look. Eli Riddle has none of the above. Melkerson estimates that 
the band's average concert draw is a few dozen; low billings are common, 
including the one that finds Eli Riddle playing in the opening slot on a 
three-act program tonight at the Electric Circus in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just too careful. I don't feel comfortable getting up and showing off, 
and if I do, it's by accident," Melkerson said Tuesday, speaking in his 
affable, low-key way as he sat in a restaurant around the corner from his 
cubbyhole apartment. "The only time I'm not careful is when I'm just jamming on 
guitar and playing spontaneously." 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of the time, he said, he just shuts his eyes and tunes out his 
surroundings. "There's always that bit of self-consciousness that can creep in. 
If I have my eyes closed, I can just think about the music; I can get closer to 
it. The songs have more personality than anything I can do onstage, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "How I work (on the band's stage effectiveness) is by keeping the music busy," 
he added. "I spend a lot of time on the arrangements, throwing in highlights, 
keeping the variety going. We're more like a jazz band, where you're watching a 
band play and not expecting them to do anything but get off on the music." 
</P>
<P>
 That stage shyness has been there since the first gig Melkerson played with 
John Kelly and Dave Tabone, the guitarist and drummer who have been with him in 
both Eggplant and Eli Riddle. They debuted at a party at Kelly's house in 1981 
when they were all classmates at Westminster High.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was afraid to be seen. It was a big question who would be up front. 
Having people look at you, analyze you" was a fearsome prospect, Melkerson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 After high school, Melkerson took a brief stab at UC San Diego but decided he 
wanted to play rock instead. Eggplant took shape in the mid-'80s and emerged in 
'89-90 with two fine albums for Doctor Dream Records, "Monkeybars" and "Sad 
Astrology." In Eggplant, Melkerson shared the singing and songwriting with Jeff 
Beals. They harmonized well and were good songwriting foils for each other; 
Beals interjecting a sense of whimsy that balanced Melkerson's more 
introspective bent. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1991, though, Melkerson wanted full control and split amicably with Beals. 
Kelly and Tabone followed him into Eli Riddle, which was named after a song 
from "Monkeybars." Joining them at first was David Black, an accomplished 
bassist whose main gig was with the Pacific Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I felt intimidated," Melkerson said. "He was so good, and he was an 
older guy. I didn't think I could demand of him the same things I could demand 
of my friends." 
</P>
<P>
 About two years ago, Melkerson brought in another bassist, Richard Ivemeyer, 
who had played in Huntington Beach punk bands. Ivemeyer was a customer at the 
Westminster pawn shop where Melkerson worked for seven years. (Melkerson since 
has gone on to become the manager of another pawn shop in Anaheim. Of his day 
job, he said: "Every person you deal with, you have to barter back and forth. 
It gets to be a grind. I try to keep on an even keel with people but it's hard 
to have a heart in a pawn shop, that's for sure.") 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out the band as a recently recruited harmony singer is Chris 
Fairbanks, Melkerson's fiancee of four years. They plan to be married in April. 
</P>
<P>
 After an aborted first stab at recording in 1992, and a tepid attempt to 
attract a record deal, Eli Riddle set about recording its album about a year 
ago. The band secured a good deal at a Los Alamitos studio through another of 
Melkerson's pawn shop acquaintances but could work only when the studio wasn't 
otherwise booked. Consequently, the project stretched out to nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Brought in at a total recording and manufacturing budget of $7,000, the 10 
songs on "Eli Riddle" lay out Melkerson's core dilemma: Given a world we know 
is fraught with disappointment and circumscribed by heartbreaking limitation, 
how can we get up the gumption to move forward? 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't go on. I must go on," is how the Irish writer Samuel Beckett put it. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Shellfish," the album's opening song, Melkerson puts it like this: 
</P>
<P>
 I cannot boast of many things,  
</P>
<P>
 I cannot hope for anything . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I'll be myself, my enemy,  
</P>
<P>
 I keep on, I keep on.  
</P>
<P>
 As the album continues, we deepen our acquaintance with this sympathetic, very 
human speaker who is self-defeating, yet determined to overcome his weaknesses, 
who sees himself as an underdog, yet is quietly dogged in his conviction that 
the main thing is not to give up. 
</P>
<P>
 Melkerson says he accumulates fragments of thought in notebooks, then stitches 
together pieces that seem to fit after he has found a musical framework. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put it together more out of feel and phrasing and mood" than a concern for 
a unified theme, he said. "I like to leave it loose. But a certain 
philosophical thing is going on there. I've always been interested in that, 
just thinking about the whole deal. You can get overwhelmed. You have high 
aspirations, and you know your stuff's good. But you know how hard it is. I do 
take the band seriously, and maybe that crops up in my lyrics: How hard it is 
to do what you want." 
</P>
<P>
 True to the ambivalent outlook in his songs, Melkerson sees both hopeful and 
disappointing possibilities for Eli Riddle. 
</P>
<P>
 College radio could take to the album. A following could build. A record 
contract could result. The band members even might be able to quit their day 
jobs and make a living playing music.  
</P>
<P>
 But the world being what it is, Melkerson also knows the band could continue 
to do fine work in obscurity. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a manager, without label muscle to push the record, "I can only do so 
much. I would like to play to larger crowds. I would like to play to an 
enthusiastic audience that knows the tunes and wants to see us play, where 
we're not just an addition on a bill. That's my goal. But (achieving) more than 
that is a crapshoot." 
</P>
<P>
 To get maximum local exposure for the CD release, he is selling it for just 
$5, at gigs, at Moby Disc stores or through the band's own label, Vital Music 
(P.O. Box 908, Westminster, CA. 92684-0908). He said hearing the record "is 
what's going to make somebody come back to see you again. If 10% (of those who 
hear it) come back, that's enough to (gather) a following and get on (good) 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the music is ripe enough that it would satisfy a lot of ears. It just 
depends if we get lucky and the buzz thing starts. If it doesn't generate 
momentum, we'll probably be just a hobby. But I'll play forever; I'll always be 
in a band. The bottom line that makes it all worthwhile is I play with really 
cool people. There's a real good unspoken thing there. We're all in it for 
wherever it goes." 
</P>

FOR THE GARCIAS, MUSIC'S ALWAYS A FAMILY AFFAIR; JAZZ: THE BAND THINKS MUCH OF 
ITS SUCCESS COMES FROM BEING KIN. 'IT'S LIKE BALLPLAYERS,' ONE BROTHER SAYS. 
'THE BETTER THEY KNOW EACH OTHER, THE BETTER THEY WORK TOGETHER.'

 The Garcia Brothers didn't start out playing Latin jazz. It took conguero 
Poncho Sanchez to influence the three siblings -- bassist Raul, 
pianist-arranger Robert and timbale player Rudy -- to abandon their careers as 
straight jazz musicians and to turn to the world of salsa and Afro-Cuban 
sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first band we had," Raul recently recalled, "was a trio that played the 
basic standards and contemporary jazz tunes. We picked up on Horace Silver, the 
Crusaders. . . . Those were the kinds of people we emulated, dissected and 
studied." 
</P>
<P>
 But when they heard Sanchez in 1978 "playing the Latin stuff, it blew us away. 
We kept saying, 'We've got to start doing this music and get back to our 
roots.' " 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, "moving into the Latin field was easy. Because we had 
studied jazz, we had a sense of the music; jazz prepared us for the structure 
and harmony that you find in Latin music. And the rhythms, well, we had that 
Latin jazz thing in our blood." 
</P>
<P>
 Today the three brothers lead a nine-member band modeled after Sanchez's 
successful octet. The ninth member, guitarist Bobby Redfield, has close ties to 
Sanchez, having played in his first ensembles. 
</P>
<P>
 Raul remembers meeting "Bobby through our conga player, Rolando Mendoza, who 
introduced us in '86 or '87. Bobby had some guys cancel on a New Year's Eve gig 
and asked my brother Robert to sit in. He asked Robert if he knew anyone who 
played bass, and Robert said, 'Yeah, my brother plays bass.' Then he said he 
needed a timbale player, and Robert said, 'Yeah, my other brother plays 
timbales.' Later that week, he offered us the gig full time. He put us to work 
for three years. Now we return the favor." 
</P>
<P>
 "I play with them when I can," said Redfield, who still leads his own quintet 
in the area. "My group is more like what Cal Tjader did, with some bossa nova 
and Brazilian music thrown in. Their group is more like Tito (Puente) and 
Poncho with full rhythm section and horns playing more Cuban and Puerto Rican 
styles. With my small group, I can call standards or boleros, and the guys know 
what to do. There's more orchestration and chart reading with the big (Garcia 
Brothers) band." 
</P>
<P>
 The Garcia Brothers' connections to Sanchez go beyond his having inspired 
them, and their subsequently having sat in with him. Arranger Robert studied 
with pianist Charles Otwell, who did the majority of the arranging for the 
Sanchez band during its first eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 Otwell was introduced to Sanchez by none other than Redfield. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As family, the Garcias are comfortable with this tightknit quality of the 
Latin jazz clique. Indeed, Raul thinks a lot of their success has to do with 
their being related. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like ballplayers," he said. "The better they know each other, the better 
they work together. And the instincts we have for what each other is doing, 
because we've known each other for our entire lives, always has us thinking 
along the same lines." 
</P>
<P>
 Rudy and Raul are 40-year-old twins; Robert is a year older. Their uncle, Rudy 
Garcia, was a professional piano player who led a trio in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our dad also played a little bit of piano," said Raul, "but he was best at 
emphasizing the technical side of the music -- and instilling discipline. He 
often told us we couldn't go out and play ball until we practiced our 
instruments." 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers began their musical pursuits when Rudy and Raul were 8 and Robert 
was 9. "We came home from the ballpark one day," Raul said, "and there were 
three little accordions lined up on the floor for us. And my dad said, 'There 
they are. You start lessons tomorrow.' " 
</P>
<P>
 From there, all three brothers moved on to piano. Raul moved on to guitar and 
then picked up the bass in the late '70s, when the brothers' band needed a 
bassist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Redfield, 56, also started at age 8, but he was a guitarist from the start. He 
also, as a teen-ager, worked at the Fender Guitar plant in La Habra and played 
with Ellis Marsalis -- the father of Wynton, Branford and Delfeayo -- when 
Marsalis was stationed at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station in the '50s. 
"There used to be a little jam session in Santa Ana at a little Mexican 
restaurant called the Casa Grande, and Ellis would come down and play with us," 
Redfield said. "He was a real teacher even then. I was having trouble playing ' 
'Round Midnight' and he showed me how to play it the right way." 
</P>
<P>
 Redfield went on to make a living playing with various R&B bands, hooked up 
with the Righteous Brothers in the early '60s and spent five years touring with 
Bill Medley after the brothers went their separate ways. He also played with 
saxophonist Art Pepper and studied with the revered be-bop pianist Joe Albany. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, one fateful night in 1972, he sat in with the late bandleader Cal 
Tjader. "It changed my whole outlook on music and was the beginning of my Latin 
jazz career," Redfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Garcia Brothers, featuring Redfield, will release their first recording 
next month on the Dos Coronas label, a subsidiary of A&M. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Garcia Brothers, featuring Bobby Redfield, play Friday at 9 p.m. at Cafe 
Lido, 501 30th St., Newport Beach. (714) 675-2968.

 Forrest Sawyer Hit by Malaria: "Day One" anchor Forrest Sawyer, who thought he 
was suffering from a bad flu, finally checked himself in to a New York hospital 
and has been diagnosed as having malaria. Despite taking precautionary shots, 
Sawyer apparently picked up the bug while in Vietnam for an early-January 
edition of "Day One" featuring a reunion of U.S. and Vietnamese veterans of the 
bloody 1965 Battle of Ia Drang Valley. At least one of the U.S. vets who went 
to Vietnam with the ABC newsmagazine has also come down with the disease.

 Cruise Toys With Harvard Image: Tom Cruise traded his pin stripes and dress 
whites for a bra and hot-pink pumps as he accepted the man of the year award 
from Harvard University's Hasty Pudding club Tuesday night. Cruise, who played 
Harvard-schooled lawyers in "The Firm" and "A Few Good Men," donned the pumps 
after his hosts joked about the 5-foot-9 actor's reputation for not wanting to 
share a stage with anyone taller. Men in drag then ran up, kissed Cruise and 
gave him a bra with a bright red satin Harvard insignia on each cup. Cruise put 
it on over his tuxedo, and joked: "I know for certain that (this award) . . . 
has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that I just played two Harvard 
grads."

 MPAA Expands Anti-Piracy Efforts: Pirated videocassettes valued at more than 
$18 million were seized by the Motion Picture Assn. of America in cooperation 
with federal and state law enforcement officials during 1993, and in May the 
FBI closed down the largest unauthorized video duplication operation ever 
uncovered in the United States. That Virginia-based operation alone could have 
cost American film companies an estimated $60 million in annual income. The 
information is contained in a report on anti-piracy efforts issued Wednesday by 
the MPAA. Included are 1993 criminal cases against six people charged as the 
result of raids at 49 California locations in June, during which 20,000 alleged 
pirated tapes were seized. POP/ROCK

JARMAN: ARTIST, ACTIVIST AND ICONOCLAST; APPRECIATION: THE DIRECTOR WAS 
ADMIRABLE AS A FILMMAKER FOR THE RISKS HE ALWAYS TOOK AND AS A MAN FOR HIS 
OUTSPOKEN ADVOCACY OF GAY RIGHTS. 
</P>

 Britain's iconoclastic Derek Jarman, who died Saturday at 52 from AIDS 
complications, made the kind of films you either loved or hated. His 
experimental work confounded and often outraged audiences with their surreal 
style and frank eroticism. He is perhaps best known for his most recently 
released film, the 1992 "Edward II," his most accessible work, a modern-dress 
version of Christopher Marlowe's Elizabethan tragedy. Jarman transformed the 
monarch's scandalous, ill-fated affair with a handsome courtier into a timely, 
fiery attack on homophobia. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three other of his pictures have received local theatrical releases: 
"Sebastiane" (1978), about the life of a martyred saint in which everyone 
speaks Latin; "Caravaggio" (1986), his highly innovative biography of the 
16th-Century Italian painter; and "War Requiem" (1990), in which Jarman 
accompanied Benjamin Britten's oratorio with a flow of anti-war imagery, 
presented as reminiscences by a World War I veteran (Laurence Olivier, in a 
fitting screen farewell). 
</P>
<P>
 Jarman was consistently admirable as a filmmaker for the risks he always took 
and as a man for his outspoken advocacy of gay rights. Although Jarman never 
made a remotely commercial movie in his career of more than 20 years, he 
commanded the front pages of all three of London's "serious" papers on the 
occasion of his death, a tribute to the impact of his high-profile activism far 
more than his bold artistry. Jarman did not have the same celebrity in America, 
but was nonetheless deeply admired by gays -- in England he was even called 
"Saint Derek" -- and by sophisticated filmgoers; for all their gay sensibility, 
Jarman's films were never aimed exclusively at gay audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 In person, Jarman, who came to Hollywood in May, 1992, to promote "Edward II," 
proved to be in many ways much more the traditional Englishman than his films 
would ever suggest him to be, and he described himself as the product of a 
supportive "suburban family." He was a warm, open, good-looking man of much wit 
and typically impeccable British manners.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Diagnosed with HIV in 1986, he went public with his health status in 1987; by 
1990 he had already rebounded from tuberculosis of the liver and temporary 
blindness and had resumed his career. He said that even before his own 
diagnosis, AIDS, to which he had lost many friends, began to shape his work.  
</P>
<P>
 "War Requiem" was preceded, for example, by his apocalyptic "The Last of 
England" (1987), envisioning a Britain after the fall of government, and 
followed by the even more dazzlingly surreal "The Garden" (1991), in which the 
story of Christ is juxtaposed with the fate of a pair of young gay lovers, who 
are also crucified. Jarman went on to complete "Wittgenstein," a fiercely 
demanding account of the life of the philosopher that unfolds in tableaux, and 
"Blue," in which the only visual image is an unchanging blue screen, a metaphor 
for Jarman's virtual blindness; its soundtrack is structured around his 
illness. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 From the start, Jarman, who began as a painter and was a production designer 
for Ken Russell's "The Devils" (1971) and "The Savage Messiah" (1972), was 
plunged into censorship battles, beginning when Channel 4, England's minority 
TV channel, announced plans to air "Sebastiane" and his next film, "Jubilee," 
which was an exceedingly free adaptation of "The Tempest." He caused an 
international uproar in 1991 when in a letter to the Guardian newspaper he 
criticized Ian McKellen, an openly gay actor, for accepting a knighthood from 
the Tory government, which under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher passed an act 
forbidding local government funding of activities thought to "promote" 
homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarman in turn was criticized by 18 individuals prominent in the British arts, 
who publicly declared their own homosexuality in support of McKellen. "The 
whole thing was rather like the Nazis giving an Iron Cross to a rabbi for 
saving Jews," remarked Jarman with characteristic sharpness. "Ian was co-opted, 
like all Shakespearean actors are. It is, after all, the Royal Shakespeare 
Company! Ian is a very nice man, and he's very put out with me, but somebody 
had to stand up and not be counted."

MOVIE REVIEW; WEIRDNESS IS CORNERSTONE OF THE 'CEMENT GARDEN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Most movies are so bland that occasionally the sheer differentness of a plot, 
an idea, a character can count for a lot. But sometimes a cigar is just a cigar 
and sometimes weirdness is just weirdness. "The Cement Garden," adapted from 
the 1978 Ian McEwan novel, certainly gets points for being different, but is it 
good? 
</P>
<P>
 The film (at the Nuart) opens with the kind of ghastly dysfunctional family 
dinner scene that immediately deposits us in Weirdsville. Jack (Andrew 
Robertson) is a surly, languid, pimply 15-year-old. His eldest sister Julie 
(Charlotte Gainsbourg) is combative. Their younger sister and brother, Sue 
(Alice Coultard) and Tom (Ned Birkin), seem normal until the plot kicks in. 
(Tom, for example, enjoys dressing up as a girl and wearing wigs to dinner.)  
</P>
<P>
 Their parents, played by Hanns Zischler and Sinead Cusack, are a classic 
mismatch: He's a martinet, she's an earth-mother realist. They live in a 
block-like building in the middle of nowhere on the rubbishy outskirts of 
London. When Father wants to cement over their garden, Jack discovers the joys 
of masturbation. His climax coincides with Father's collapse from a heart 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it goes. 
</P>
<P>
 McEwan's novel was celebrated for its matter-of-fact surrealism and the film, 
written and directed by Andrew Birkin, manages to capture McEwan's air of 
nightmare plausibility. But it's a coy, drab, chuckling nightmare . When the 
four kids also lose their mother, they contrive a cement coffin in the cellar 
and proceed to play out their oddest tendencies. Jack, who is priapic toward 
Julie in a dreamy, disconnected way, spends most of his time circling around 
her seductions. (She snipes at him, then asks him to rub her back with suntan 
lotion.) When she takes up with a rich, sporty twit (Jochen Horst), Jack's 
distress becomes painfully comic. Jealousy makes him industrious. 
</P>
<P>
 Birkin at least has the good sense to let this material play itself out 
without winking at the audience. He understands the demented complacency at the 
heart of McEwan's particular madness. A few of the performances, notably from 
Cusack and Gainsbourg (whose French accent, amazingly, is nowhere to be heard), 
are inspired. 
</P>
<P>
 But the direction isn't. Too often the matter-of-fact nuttiness is just blah. 
Cocteau and Polanski and Bunuel worked with similar material and managed to 
make their movies hair-raising without losing their cool. With Birkin, cool is 
just about all there is. His straight face is encased in cement. 'The Cement 
Garden' Andrew Robertson: Jack Charlotte Gainsbourg: Julie Alice Coultard: Sue 
Sinead Cusack: Mother
