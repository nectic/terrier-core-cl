ART REVIEW; MUSEUM UPDATES ITS LOOK; THE UCLA/ARMAND HAMMER CENTER PUTS AWAY 
ITS OLD MASTERS FOR A COLLECTION OF WORK FROM THE 1980S. MOSTLY WORTHWHILE ART 
IS FOUND IN 'THE ASSERTIVE IMAGE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 There's something delicious about galleries that ordinarily house Old Master 
paintings being rehung with contemporary art -- and looking infinitely better 
for it. A pious veneration of established names from history can blind a viewer 
to the reality that even the greatest artists are capable of routine 
mediocrity, while artists of our own day can produce work equal to most 
anything in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 This principle is being amply demonstrated at the UCLA/Armand Hammer Museum of 
Art and Cultural Center. The young museum's largely second-rate collection of 
Old Master and 19th-Century paintings has been taken down, temporarily replaced 
with a loan exhibition of art (mostly paintings) from the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a lot more worth looking at in "The Assertive Image: Artists of the 
Eighties From the Eli Broad Family Foundation" than there is when the Hammer's 
minor Fragonard, Renoirs and Fantin-Latours occupy the walls. (A number of 
those will be reinstalled in a different part of the museum in mid-July.) 
Architecturally, the museum's handsome, sky-lit, permanent collection galleries 
were designed as a subtle mix of modern spareness and Beaux Arts detailing, and 
they have never looked better than they do right now. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 76 works on view are 20 exemplary pieces by Cindy Sherman, who, with 
each passing season, more assuredly seems to rank at the very top of the most 
important artists to have emerged in the last decade. The show is also marked 
by estimable paintings and mixed-media works by Anselm Kiefer, Lari Pittman, 
Tim Ebner, Julian Schnabel, Jean-Michel Basquiat, David Salle and others. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 John Ahearn's painted fiberglass wall reliefs, which are life casts made from 
kids and adults in ordinary Bronx neighborhoods, have been installed on outdoor 
walls at the gallery entrance. There, they give a good sense of the poignant 
heroizing of the everyday so compelling achieved in Ahearn's best work. 
</P>
<P>
 Some artists, notably Barbara Kruger, are more erratically represented. Her 
signature blast of feminist-inspired, graphically acute agitprop, "Untitled 
(Your Body Is a Battleground)," rendered at billboard scale, blows away her 
lesser works on nearby walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the thin representation of Mike Kelley's scatalogically incisive 
work, soon to be surveyed in a high-profile retrospective at the Los Angeles 
County Museum of Art, feels perfunctory. The graffiti-like paintings of Keith 
Haring are not among his best, and Jonathan Lasker's small abstractions, which 
actually read as paradoxical attempts to represent a critical idea of what 
abstraction is, are mostly mediocre examples. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also works by artists of considerably over-inflated reputation. 
Robert Morris' baroque efforts to viscerally picture modern violence and 
genocide are stylish bombast. Peter Halley's flashy, Day-Glo abstractions add 
up to little but vacuous yard goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, though, considerably more worthwhile than forgettable art of the 
1980s will be found in the exhibition, which makes it a pleasure to see. That 
said, however, there's also a decided oddness to the show. 
</P>
<P>
 A sampler drawn from a privately formed assembly of works of art, it reveals 
more about an individual's taste than about the period under review. For 
instance, all the art is by well-known artists who were commercially successful 
during the high-flying marketplace of the 1980s. You won't find any surprising 
work by artists outside the commodity glare, although good, and sometimes even 
great, artists can be found there. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme of "assertive imagery" is also dubious. Hardly a phenomenon unique 
to the 1980s, a desire for an art of dramatic confrontation could describe a 
judiciously selected body of work from almost any decade in our volatile 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does it appropriately describe Ebner's conceptually elegant, modular 
works, or Sean Scully's single canvas of painted stripes. And if there is a 
polar opposite to the concept of assertive imagery, surely the joke-painting 
and wall-mounted fiberglass cast of an automobile hood by Richard Prince 
together define it. The exhibition's ostensible theme seems more a rationalized 
afterthought, mostly useful for promotional packaging. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, despite its subtitle, more than a third of the show does not come from 
the Broad Family Foundation; instead, it has been lent from the personal 
collection of Eli and Edythe Broad. Significant distinctions separate 
foundation collections, which are legally bound by public responsibilities, 
from private collections, which are not. Disappointingly, especially for a 
university museum, the show does not articulate those differences. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eli Broad recently joined the board of the Hammer Museum, as part of its 
warranted restructuring from an independent entity to an affiliate of UCLA. He 
houses much of his family's foundation collection in a seaside building in 
Santa Monica. Not a museum open to the general public, the foundation is a 
study center that also has operated as a kind of art-lending library to 
cash-strapped museums, especially in the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 However, its galleries are also accessible to an art-interested public, who 
can (and do) request tours of its periodically changing installations. To a 
local art audience that has been actively engaged since the foundation opened 
its building in December, 1988, few of the works that have been transported the 
few miles from Santa Monica to Westwood will be unfamiliar. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply put, it's hard to say to what end "The Assertive Image" has been 
organized. The show offers many individual works to relish, but it's also 
something of a puzzlement.

CLUB REVIEW; IT'S THE ROOM WITH MUSIC AND MIRRORS 
</P>

<P>
 Good thing the Room is simply called the Room, because the year-old Hollywood 
night spot is really not much else. It's just another black-and-red space in a 
town that's filled with them -- many concentrated within a quarter-mile radius 
of the Room. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering the club through a back alley gives a sense of something unusual or 
different to come, but once inside, not even the dozens of mirrors that hang on 
the walls can conjure the illusion of something interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 The size of the Room -- small even by Hollywood standards -- probably limits 
the potential for live music, but even the smallest space should allow room for 
a proper deejay setup. 
</P>
<P>
 The music here is spun from turntables placed on two bar stools. On a recent 
night, the deejay sifted through records strewn to the right of the bar area, 
carefully placing recent records from Gang Starr and A Tribe Called Quest on 
the rickety setup. The deejay's halfhearted attempt to enliven the crowd by 
mixing old Santana with contemporary hip-hop, which was met with a lukewarm 
response, made the whole experience seem pretty depressing.

ART REVIEWS; VISIONS OF SEDUCTION, REPULSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KANDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At Christopher Grimes Gallery, Lisa Yuskavage is showing paintings of doe-eyed 
females who are less pulchritudinous than pathetic. Here are Vargas girls minus 
the sex appeal, Barbies minus the soignee proportions, post-adolescent Kewpie 
dolls minus the pedophiliac charm. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Hostess Twinkies, these girl-creatures consecrate themselves to the task 
of seduction, yet are only able to master repulsion. They are obscenely sweet, 
absurdly bloated and leave a distinctly chemical aftertaste. 
</P>
<P>
 Yuskavage preps us for a series of soft-core mise en scenes , dressing her 
figures in costumes that suggest choreographed sexual encounters (the bellhop, 
the ballerina, the suburban housewife), or dressing them in next to nothing (a 
polka-dotted diaper or a strategically placed cup of tea). With no narrative 
context, just color-coordinated backdrops of leaf green, lemon-yellow or 
tangerine, only the imagination limits the fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, with their massive thighs and narrow shoulders, knocked knees and pointy 
breasts, the would-be pinups wholly elude the reach of the pornographic. 
Yuskavage exaggerates their proportions such that they become less failures 
than mutants. 
</P>
<P>
 This sense is redoubled as you study the images: a squatting blonde has only 
one foot; another has breasts at cross purposes with one another, one shown in 
profile, the other head-on, so eager to please they wind up shattering the 
illusion. 
</P>
<P>
 To a large extent, all this comes out of formal concerns. First impressions 
aside, Yuskavage is very much a Minimalist, struggling to portray the figure in 
the most efficient manner, even if that means tossing out body parts and 
limiting her palette so that each element is knit into an overall ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the subject matter is deliberate, and as far as feminism goes, difficult. 
These paintings depict the flip-side of painter Nicole Eisenman's Amazon 
warriors, who whoop it up with their booty of lopped-off penises. There is 
nothing empowering about these vulnerable if overstuffed waifs. 
</P>
<P>
 Yuskavage is not interested in role models or role reversals. She works in a 
much more complex way, cajoling us into acknowledging our dread power as 
viewers, and into experiencing the shame we provoke in those things and people 
upon whom we habitually and relentlessly gaze.

 Sleight of Hand: It is difficult to imagine the work of either Brian Moss or 
Warren Neidich, juxtaposed in a witty two-person exhibition at the Annex at Jan 
Kesner Gallery, without the example of Sherrie Levine. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine's project, which involved rephotographing images by well-known male 
photographers only to present them as her own, has come to figure the highly 
theoretical practice that dominated in the 1980s. Into Levine's critique of the 
intertwined pieties of originality and authorship, Moss and Neidich insinuate a 
bit of computer-generated sleight of hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is work that is technically and conceptually slick, though rather 
more flippant than its forerunner. If Levine hints at what critic Harold Bloom 
has called the exhaustion of being a "latecomer" -- one who arrives on the 
scene once everything seems to have been said and done -- Neidich makes this 
exhaustion explicit. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of archival photographs of Surrealists, Italian Futurists, Andy Warhol 
and the Factory retinue are presented salon-style. One dark-haired mustachioed 
fellow pops up in every picture, transcending time, space and, presumably, 
artistic style. This figure is the very slippery, very determined Neidich. 
</P>
<P>
 Assisted by a simple computer program, he gleefully deletes Richard 
Pousette-Dart from Nina Leen's 1951 photograph of "The Irascibles" and 
substitutes himself. He erases an unidentified member of the Bauhaus so he can 
hang out with Walter Gropius and Paul Klee. With tongue-in-cheek precision (and 
a serious debt to Woody Allen's Zelig), Neidich enacts the romance of trespass. 
He enters the sacred realm of creativity, while paying only cut-rate dues. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss moves in the opposite direction, taking familiar images from the history 
of photography and removing certain elements entirely. This is not so much to 
rob the images of their meanings, but to reveal meanings that have long been 
obscured. What makes this endeavor resonant is that Moss begins with images 
whose veracity is already questionable. 
</P>
<P>
 The protagonist is eliminated from a 1936 Robert Capa photograph, "Death of 
Loyalist Soldier," leaving behind nothing but a barren landscape. According to 
the story, Capa asked the soldier if he could take his picture, only to record 
the latter being shot by a sniper while posing. 
</P>
<P>
 An abandoned gun is the centerpiece of an altered version of Alexander 
Gardner's 1863 "Sharpshooter's Last Sleep, Gettysburg." Moss has removed the 
figure, thereby mimicking Gardner, who is said to have moved the dead body to a 
more picturesque spot expressly for the purpose of the photograph. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Neidich, Moss plays a re-styled game of hide-and-seek. In both bodies of 
work, this game becomes the mechanism by which to suggest that the dialectic of 
presence and absence is the only "truth" a photograph ever promulgates.

 Trashing Books: A young woman sits at a makeshift table in a makeshift room 
that has been slipped inside the gallery space as neatly as the lining of a 
glove. 
</P>
<P>
 Oblivious to those who watch her -- and then, when bored, abandon her -- she 
concentrates upon the task at hand: cutting strips of text from a book and 
winding those strips into small, medium and large balls. Language is dispatched 
like so much trash. More precisely, it is transformed through labor into 
something visual -- something, it is implied, of value. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Hamilton's new installation, "lineament," now on view at Ruth Bloom 
Gallery, recapitulates the logic of her installation "tropos," seen this past 
winter at New York's Dia Center for the Arts. In the earlier work, Hamilton's 
inevitable woman-at-a-table busied herself with singeing line after line of 
printed matter. The meticulous nature of her work was announced, for those who 
weren't already listening, by the rug that covered the floor, an elaborate 
concoction of woven horsehair. 
</P>
<P>
 With a gargantuan nod to Joseph Beuys, Hamilton continues to make a fetish of 
absorption over reflection, ritual over critique and, above all, action over 
words. While there is certainly something seductive about concentrated silence, 
especially in the sunset years of post-Conceptualist verbosity, there is a 
retrogressive quality to Hamilton's particular take on it. 
</P>
<P>
 She rejects cognition, here represented by the endless words that fill endless 
books, in order to privilege mind-numbing repetition. Though this repetition 
serves the ostensibly greater cause of sensual fulfillment, what's troubling is 
its explicit association with the feminine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your highest female grace is silence," Ben Jonson once wrote. Indeed, if we 
could watch Hamilton singe or snip this very line, "lineament" might have been 
more a more important, and certainly more political, work.

 A Piercing Look: Catherine Opie's luminous photographs at Regen Projects 
depict lesbians in the process of turning themselves into men, drag queens 
strutting their stuff, men whose bodies are swathed in exquisite tattoos up to 
their thigh-high, lace-up boots, and more pierced ears, nipples, eyebrows, lips 
and tongues than have filled a Westside gallery in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Opie makes not only visible, but mesmerizing, those whose invisibility has 
long upheld the mythology of what is supposedly natural. In her portraits, 
gender barely registers. It is portrayed as a well-calibrated performance, a 
matter of costuming, a question of attitude and something always up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
 What is most interesting is not the political thrust of the work, nor even its 
insistent aesthetics. It is the way in which the images, seen en masse, reveal 
that the passage from subcultural resistance to the subcultural generic is 
occurring, with lightning-quick speed. 
</P>
<P>
 Take a few variables -- white undershirt, blue jeans, silver hoop earrings, 
tribal tattoos -- and you can come up with infinite permutations, each a minute 
variation on that which preceded it. Ironically, Opie's would-be rogues' 
gallery looks much like artist Mitchell Syrop's constellation of nearly 
identical high school yearbook photos: a vision of the institutionalization of 
style.

THEATER REVIEWS; AN ALL-FEMALE 'OTHELLO' AT ODYSSEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Women's Shakespeare Company, which stages all-female versions 
of Shakespeare's classics, is by its very nature iconoclastic. There is an 
implicit radicalism in the notion of women playing the great male Shakespearean 
roles. However, there's nothing polemical about the company's production of 
"Othello" at the Odyssey. This is simply good, solid Shakespeare, thoughtfully 
staged and performed. 
</P>
<P>
 From the outset, when the cast assembles to sing "I Am Not What I Am," it is 
evident that this "Othello" isn't a novelty act. There's not a trace of 
gimmickry or gimcrackery about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, for the women of the company, this production is more a subtle 
revenge, a longstanding vendetta dating to the days of the Globe Theater, when 
men played all the parts, both male and female, up until the present day, when 
the surest path to stardom for an attractive young woman is flashing flesh on 
the silver screen. 
</P>
<P>
 The production elements are handsome, particularly Jeanne Reith's painstaking 
period costumes. The acting, on the whole, is good. Apparently relieved at 
their respite from the proliferation of wife and victim roles, the actors who 
play the male roles capture the essence of masculinity without parody.  
</P>
<P>
 Though her performance lacks the rich dimensionality that marks the truly 
great Othellos, Fran Bennett invests the Moor with an almost mystical dignity 
that is authoritative. Leigh Curran's Iago has a sardonic malignity that 
transcends the inherent limitations of Shakespeare's stock villain. (One can't 
help but imagine Iagos through the centuries asking, "But what's my real 
motivation for hating the Moor?") 
</P>
<P>
 Karole Foreman plays Cassio with an affecting boyishness that gibes well with 
her slight physical stature. Lisa Wolpe's buffoonishly gullible Roderigo 
provides welcome comic relief until the bitter end. Emilie Talbot's nicely 
astringent Emilia explodes with passionate intensity at the folly wrought upon 
her beloved lady, Desdemona, and Virginia Ray's performance as this ultimate 
wife/victim is touching, never treacly. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolpe, who also founded the company, directs tastefully and respectfully. 
Indeed, there are times when one wishes that Wolpe had been a little more 
outrageously revisionistic in her approach. However, perhaps the point of this 
production is not to shock the audience with the offbeat, but rather to press 
home the universality of Shakespeare's themes. 
</P>
<P>
 So why are men dressed as women funny, and women dressed as men dignified? Let 
the sociologists ponder the question, while Shakespeare lovers hie themselves 
posthaste to the Odyssey for an evening of the real thing. 
</P>

THEATER REVIEWS; TWO VISIONS OF THE UNIVERSALITY OF SHAKESPEARE; GENDER-BENDING 
WITH 'HENRY V' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Go west for gender-bending Shakespeare. In Culver City, a new group, 
FreightTrain Shakespeare, is staging an adventurous "Henry V" in which several 
men's roles are played by women -- and a man and a woman play, respectively, 
the erstwhile Mistress Quickly and her husband, Pistol. Not too far away, L.A. 
Women's Shakespeare Co. is presenting an all-female "Othello." 
</P>
<P>
 In "Henry V," FreightTrain's purpose isn't so much pro-feminist as 
pro-imagination. Director Tom Quaintance, a former assistant of La Jolla 
Playhouse's Des McAnuff, plants his actors -- in nondescript contemporary 
clothes -- inside the audience, before they rise to go onstage. His point (also 
discussed in program notes) is that the action takes place primarily in the 
audience's imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Shakespeare himself made the same point when he gave the Chorus (Erick Avari) 
a number of lines that emphasize that this is just a play, not a real invasion 
of France. We take the cross-gender casting in the same spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Stripped of its realistic detail, the play presumably becomes more of a 
meditation on universal themes and less of a historical pageant. Of course this 
also is the least expensive route for a brand-new company. But in this case 
economies of budget coincide happily with the interpretive spin. 
</P>
<P>
 This approach is also well-timed. A "Henry V" that's distanced from its 
historical period is an ideal choice for the 50th anniversary of our own 
century's most famous invasion of France. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that this "Henry" is set in 1944 any more than in the original's 1415. As 
Henry, Joseph Haj resembles a pirate, not Dwight Eisenhower. He wears a scarf 
around his head, and his undershirt conceals only half of a tattoo. Especially 
in the opening scenes, assisted by John D. Palmer's moody lighting, Haj's eyes 
beam out of haunted pools of darkness. His body is lean and wiry, his voice 
skittishly intense rather than deeply resonant. 
</P>
<P>
 This Henry could lead men to victory, but he can be cold and ruthless too -- 
which is precisely Quaintance's intent, judging from his program notes. Still, 
Haj is audibly relieved when he's spared the ordeal of carrying out his most 
harrowing threat. He's no monster. 
</P>
<P>
 Quaintance has deleted enough lines to make for a lean, sinewy "Henry," with 
no intermission. That still might seem like a long sit, but Quaintance keeps 
the action swift and stirring, aided by Michael Cowell's percussive music. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 15 actors play two or three roles; among the outstanding creations 
are Maria Spassoff's Pistol/Alice, Weston Blakesley's Hostess/French 
King/Fluellen and Ellen Idelson's Boy. A long staircase at the back dominates 
Katherine Ferwerda's otherwise bare-bones set.

 Mulgrew Miller, whose trio opened Tuesday at Catalina, has often been 
described as a hard bop pianist. But there's much more to him than that. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller is a talented composer whose works include modal moments and 
exceptional harmonic diversity. His first set on opening night consisted of six 
extended pieces -- two originals, one blues and three standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The opener was "If I Should Lose You," with a solo introduction followed by a 
rhythm section ostinato as Miller led the group into a series of hard-driving 
variations. "Carousel," from his current album, was an engaging original in 3/4 
time, during which Richie Goods' bass solo was well served by both Miller's 
support and drummer Tony Reedus' brushwork. 
</P>
<P>
 The high point of the set was Miller's salute to "Body and Soul," a piece 
that's been played a million different ways in its 64 years but seldom with 
such subtly conceived harmonic deviations. This tour de force wound up 
surprisingly with a quote from "Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller showed his personalized way with the blues on "Blue Monk" before 
rounding things out with a sensitive treatment of "It Might as Well Be Spring." 
</P>
<P>
 * Mulgrew Miller Trio at Catalina Bar & Grill, 1640 N. Cahuenga, Hollywood, 
(213) 466-2210. 9 and 11 p.m. Door charge: $12; $15 Saturday. Ends Sunday.

TV REVIEW; MTV'S 'DEAD AT 21' LIMPS INTO ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If young Ed, who just celebrated his 20th birthday, doesn't find the mad 
scientist who implanted a fatal microchip in his brain during the next year, 
he'll be a drinking-age farm-buyer, a twentynothing can-kicker, dead at 21 . 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from the kickoff of "Dead at 21" -- MTV's first attempt at an 
action-adventure series -- it's going to be a long year, for Ed (Jack 
Noseworthy) and anyone watching this strained high-concept combination of "The 
Fugitive" and "D.O.A." Please, MTV, doesn't "Dead at 20 1/4" have just as nice 
a ring? 
</P>
<P>
 Ed's birthday is one of those good news/bad news days. First he has the swell 
fortune to find a slightly punky-looking gal he's never met before, Maria (Lisa 
Dean Ryan), in his bedroom, crashing his party and waiting to seduce him 
apparently at random. They've scarcely had a few moments to exchange postmodern 
romantic-comedy repartee when another party crasher -- a young fugitive with a 
shotgun -- leaps through Ed's sliding-glass window, followed in short order by 
a slick-haired government hit man. 
</P>
<P>
 The kid gets blasted, but not before handing Ed a crucial videotape. Our hero 
does what anyone would in the situation: noisily burglarizes a Silo store to 
play the tape, in which it's revealed that both he and the dearly departed were 
part of a "neurocybernautic" lab test to artificially increase intelligence. 
From all outer indications, the experiment was a bust, but never mind: Framed 
by the government for murder, Ed goes on the run, joined on his cycle by Maria, 
who explains, "I got nothing better to do" -- a hopeful projection of the 
target audience's Weltanschauung if ever there were one. 
</P>
<P>
 Both romantic leads are impressively big-lipped but hardly equipped to blow 
life into the dialogue. (Second-episode sample: "I'm filthy!" "That's what I 
like about you!" "I'm serious!" "Me too!") But long chats are naturally kept to 
a minimum as the series focuses on wacky visual stylization -- including some 
Ed hallucinations right out of a '60s "trip" movie -- and a nonstop barrage of 
usually inappropriate alternative-rock hits as scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 The mind wanders toward an even higher concept -- maybe combining MTV's 
previous, truly successful serial, "The Real World," with this one, selecting 
real Gen X-ers to place in mortal jeopardy. Just a thought. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Dead at 21" premieres at 11 tonight on MTV. Its normal time slot will be 
Wednesdays at 10 p.m.

APPRECIATION; AN ALL-AMERICAN; SHE WROTE THE BOOK ON PRE-COLUMBIAN CUISINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sophie Coe was a serious food historian, but at heart she probably always 
remained the playful schoolgirl who kept a tarantula in her dorm room. She 
certainly kept an eye for the unexpected: The Aztecs relishing frog tamales and 
tadpoles stewed with corn. The Mayas raising bees in gigantic bee yards with 
thousands of wooden hives. Inca gourmets and their taste for a particular kind 
of clay called pasa as a sauce for potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 She died May 15, just three weeks after the publication of her book "America's 
First Cuisines" (University of Texas: $14.95 paper/$35 cloth, 288 pp.). Her 
death is a misfortune not only for those who knew her but for everyone who's 
ever been interested in what people were eating in the Americas before 
Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, her book's title is a misfortune too. It calls to mind the media 
overkill about New World foods at the time of the Columbus quincentenary. But 
Coe knew vastly more about Aztec, Inca and Maya food than any of us journalists 
who were writing about the Columbian Exchange two years back. 
</P>
<P>
 She was born in Pasadena in 1933, the only child of the famous geneticist 
Theodosius Dobzhansky, who was teaching at Cal Tech at the time; later the 
family moved to New York, where her father taught at Columbia University and 
the Rockefeller Institute. She met her future husband when she was attending 
Radcliffe. Her roommate was engaged to Michael Coe's roommate at Harvard, and 
the roommates were constantly trying to get the two together. 
</P>
<P>
 As it happened, though, Michael Coe and Sophie Dobzhansky first met in a 
physical anthropology lab. They were working side by side measuring the cranial 
capacity of skulls by filling them with mustard seeds and then counting them 
when he suddenly realized that this was the girl his roommate had been telling 
him about, the one who kept a tarantula in her dorm room. (Sophie had picked up 
the tarantula on one of her father's trips to Brazil to collect the insects he 
studied; the Coe family still has it.) The Coes were married in 1955 and raised 
five children. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Coe, who joined the Yale faculty in 1960, went on to specialize in the 
Maya and other ancient Mexican and Central-American peoples. The most recent of 
his 13 books is last year's "Breaking the Maya Code," a history of the 
decades-long struggle to understand the Maya hieroglyphic writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophie Coe started writing about food history in the early '80s, encouraged by 
Alan Davidson, who published her first food essays in his magazine Petits 
Propos Culinaires. "America's First Cuisines" is a vast elaboration of those 
articles and the papers she presented at Davidson's annual Oxford Symposium. At 
her death she had partly completed a book about chocolate, which her husband 
reportedly plans to finish. 
</P>
<P>
 She was a natural to study Central American food history. She knew the area, 
she'd read obscure 16th and 17th century European writings on New World foods, 
and as a Harvard anthropology Ph.D. (and the wife of a major student of the 
Mayas), she was thoroughly up to date on the latest archeological and 
anthropological studies.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, she was really interested in food. All kinds of food. In Tashkent 
last year, when I looked up the family of a great scholar of Uzbek and Central 
Asian food, they took me into the great man's study and to my surprise showed 
me his correspondence with Sophie Coe (whose name they pronounced in 
quasi-Russian form as ko-yeh ). 
</P>
<P>
 Here and there in her writings, as she describes the flavor of some very odd 
thing, you suddenly realize it's from first-hand experience. For instance, she 
mentions that the poisonous hydrocyanic acid extracted from manioc root can be 
boiled down into "a very tasty sweet-sour sauce." 
</P>
<P>
 She once began a scholarly paper with the all-too-true words, "Archaeologists 
know an immense amount about cooking pots. Unfortunately, most of them know 
little or nothing about cooking." With an attitude like this, it's not 
surprising that "America's First Cuisines," scholarly though it is, never 
degenerates into a battle of footnotes. 
</P>
<P>
 The book concentrates systematically on the Aztecs, the Mayas and the Incas 
because most of the available historical material is about them. Aztec food is 
most familiar to us (as Coe points out, the most readily available 
pre-Columbian dish is guacamole, which is still often made simply of avocado, 
tomato, onion and Mexican cilantro). Still, as she shows, modern Mexican food 
and ancient Aztec food are not the same. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A sidelight on the Aztec character is their use of food as weapons. When they 
were upwind of their enemies, they'd set fire to chiles as a sort of tear gas. 
Even more diabolical, when they were besieging a city they'd roast and stew the 
fish and ducks of their lakes "so that the smoke will enter their city, and the 
smell will make the women miscarry, the children waste away, and the old men 
and old women weaken and die of longing to eat that which is unobtainable." 
</P>
<P>
 Most people have heard about how the potato (and the health-foodie grain 
called quinoa) were domesticated in the Inca's territory, and many have heard 
of various other tubers that are still eaten in Chile and Peru. It may be a 
surprise to learn that nasturtiums -- among the edible flowers that have been 
showing up on people's plates in restaurants -- were also food to the Incas, 
but they only ate the tubers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Incas' drink was corn beer ( asua ); as Coe points out, they hated water. 
In fact, they hated it so much that when the Spaniards wanted to punish an 
Inca, they'd force him to drink water. 
</P>
<P>
 Maya cooking is the least well known of the three, even though the Maya were 
the source of chocolate (and subsequent European ideas of flavoring chocolate, 
such as vanilla). At first glance their cookery looks close to Aztec, but there 
was always some Maya twist to it. For instance, instead of putting a lump of 
filling in a tamale, as the Aztecs did, they might spread out a thin layer of 
masa, cover it with a thin layer of filling and then slice it up, making 
tamales with a spiral pattern. Even today, the Maya make a 13-layered tamale 
representing the 13 levels they believe to exist in Heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everything that was cooked in the Americas in pre-Columbian was equally 
good, Coe acknowledges, but in her opinion a number of promising food ideas 
have been forgotten in the intervening centuries. "We would do well to return 
to the kitchens of the Emperor Motecuhzoma and see what we could learn there," 
she wrote. "Hot chocolate with chile is quite delicious." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before the coming of the Europeans, New World cooks had no cooking fats, not 
even vegetable oils. As a result, the pre-Columbian tamale was not the soft, 
lard-rich product made in Mexico today. In the following recipe, Sophie Coe 
recreated a variety favored by the ancient Maya. It makes a fat-free tamale 
with a good corn and bean flavor but quite a different texture -- smooth, heavy 
and gummy.  
</P>
<P>
 The Mayas used the same dough for small loaves ("as long as the palm of the 
hand and four fingers thick") that they cooked by barbecuing, frying on an 
ungreased griddle or baking in an earth oven. They seem even more archaic than 
the tamales. In baking (one hour at 450 degreees, if you really want to try 
it), the surface of the loaf dries, stiffens and cracks grotesquely, making a 
rather chewy contrast with the interior.  
</P>
<P>
 MAYA BREAD OF MAIZE AND BEANS 1 cup dried beans, soaked overnight Water 2 cups 
masa flour (not masa dough) or corn meal 1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 In pot cook beans in water several hours until they begin to fall apart. 
Result should be about 4 cups of beans and liquid. 
</P>
<P>
 If using masa flour, let beans cool, then mix well with masa flour and salt. 
If using cornmeal, pour boiling beans on cornmeal and stir furiously, then add 
salt. 
</P>
<P>
 Form corn-bean dough into balls about 2 inches in diameter, wrap in corn husks 
or foil and steam 1 hour. Makes about 20 (2-inch) tamales.

BOSNIA: SURVIVAL; MAKING FOOD PALATABLE IS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF WAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANICA KIRKA, Kirka, a former articles editor for The Times Opinion section, 
is a special correspondent working in Croatia. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Zemira Tanovic nearly embraces her brown ceramic pot, sheltering the unlikely 
symbol of sharing in a time of sacrifice. Removing the lid, she surveys her 
homemade yogurt carefully, almost as if she could see the cultures multiplying 
if she'd only look hard enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hold on to some of the last batch because you can't buy it," she says. 
Before the war, Sarajevans, unlike cooks in the countryside who raised yogurt 
from a starter culture the old-fashioned way, were used to getting their 
versions of Yoplait and Knudsen in grocery stores just like Americans. "(Now), 
it's passed among the neighbors . . . from hand to hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Food -- in a city with precious little of it -- obsesses Sarajevans. Garden 
plots watched over by armed guards have replaced grass patches; planters made 
from empty cooking oil cans have converted the city's balconies and windowsills 
into oases of salad greens. Wild herbs are collected, dried and stored. Basins 
and jugs of drinking water are held in reserve, should water be cut off again 
unexpectedly. 
</P>
<P>
 Survival itself has evolved into a ritual. Even the humanitarian rations have 
fallen into patterns: sometimes oil, sometimes what Sarajevans only 
half-jokingly refer to as Vietnam-era biscuits, often rice, always flour . . . 
and beans, beans, beans. 
</P>
<P>
 Making this food palatable continues to be one of Sarajevo's most involved 
challenges, a job shouldered by women in this patriarchal society. Cooks have 
responded with ingenuity, using experience and resolve to defy the 
circumstances and create the edible from banal basics. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get tired of eating the same thing all the time," Tanovic says. She 
especially frowns on rice and beans. "We never ate them before and we'll never 
eat them again." 
</P>
<P>
 Tanovic tries to make the beans less identifiable by smashing them into a 
paste reminiscent of the inexpensive meat pate consumed before the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Such manipulation of humanitarian aid to replace unavailable food items is the 
cornerstone of a war-time cookbook, "How to Survive on Humanitarian Aid," a 
43-page photocopied pamphlet held together by staples. Backed by the World 
Health Organization and written by a Sarajevan now living in Zagreb, the book 
should soon be distributed throughout Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Author Enesa Seremet says she chemically broke down the elements of some 
foods, considered the humanitarian aid offerings, and substituted. That means 
her recipe for cream breaks down into powdered milk, salt, water, oil and yeast 
-- staples supplied by the United Nations' High Commissioner for Refugees and 
other organizations. Her recipe for halvah breaks down into flour, oil, sugar, 
water and cinnamon. "Cheese" is formed from rice, water, vinegar and powdered 
milk.  
</P>
<P>
 The recipes form a catalogue of resistance in the war that has engulfed 
Sarajevo's civilians. Seremet argues that cutting off food supplies for 
Bosnians took on spiritual as well as physical significance for a people with a 
tradition of lengthy family meals and unquestioning hospitality. Taking away 
food, Seremet says, "is certainly the right way to kill people in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one more part of the war," she says. "We wouldn't have felt this war so 
deeply if it had not been for the food." 
</P>
<P>
 Seremet's culinary expertise arose as a consequence of war. In prewar 
Sarajevo, the one-time teacher, her husband and their two children mostly ate 
in restaurants or got takeout. "I hated to cook," she admits. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the war necessitated individual independence, Seremet set out to create 
from scratch many of the things she would once buy. 
</P>
<P>
 Things began badly. While serving her first home-baked traditional Bosnian 
bread, pita, a bomb shattered her family's apartment. The mortar blast ripped 
through the dining room and splattered fragments into Seremet's back and legs. 
Severely injured and with all hospitals filled to capacity, Seremet was forced 
to recuperate in the only room of her apartment that had escaped damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Hungry and without recourse, she experimented in the kitchen during the 10 
months she and her family waited for medical evacuation. Cooking by 
candlelight, often with little or no fuel, she wasted nothing and consumed her 
failures as well as her successes: "When you are hungry, everything works." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The women of Sarajevo realize that they are their own best source of 
information. Most don't have war-time cookbooks like Seremet's. They share 
expertise and news while waiting in food lines, at water pumping stations or, 
as in the past, over precious cups of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 Word-of-mouth recipes include Stojanka Hodzic's no-bake chocolate cake, made 
with stale bread and cocoa gleaned from the humanitarian parcels. Recipes like 
hers comprise elements of the common struggle to approach the standards of the 
past, a skirmish of the overall conflict that united women in the city's 
struggle to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone in the whole neighborhood knows one another . . . so we all know 
who's come up with another recipe," she says. "We pass it around, and for that 
week all 13 apartments (in the building) will make the same cake." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hodzic cooked her "war cake," on top of a crude cast-iron stove when Sarajevo 
faced its most violent days. With electric power now becoming more regular, the 
cake is easier to make. It melts with the consistency of pudding and looks like 
a flourless torte. Serving her creation on china and with Turkish coffee, 
Hodzic recalls better times. But, she says, Sarajevo's siege has forever 
changed the way she'll prepare -- and think about -- food.  
</P>
<P>
 The new collective memory is demonstrated by the small black volume Hodzic 
pulls from her bookcase, an ad hoc cooking literature compiling the recipes of 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have learned so much . . . to cook without eggs, butter," she says. "I 
don't even remember how to cook the way I used to." 
</P>
<P>
 The caution in cooking continues, even as the conditions of the siege ease. 
More food is available, though Sarajevans might wait most of the day in crowds 
clustered around the doors of a store that may have gotten bits of merchandise 
from Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina's new partner in a recently created 
confederation. That deal eased food prices as recently opened truck routes made 
possible the delivery of supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, after two years of war, much of the financial resources of Sarajevo's 
citizens have been exhausted, leaving most dependent on humanitarian assistance 
and packets of aid sent by families abroad to those still trapped in the noose. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tanovic's relatives in Austria have sent things, but parcels can take as long 
as eight months to arrive. So when Tanovic makes creamed spinach, she uses 
ingredients that she has watched grow from her kitchen window. Cooking the 
green glob bubbling on the stove proves much easier now than when the war first 
broke out. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the beginning of the war, we didn't even have a wood stove," she says. 
"(The tenants) of the entire building went out front and we put two rocks down 
and laid a big, flat metal plate (on top of them) to cook over a wood fire. 
Seven families used that to cook every day. Afterward, someone managed to make 
us a wood stove. And somehow, everyone else eventually got their own wood 
stoves." 
</P>
<P>
 With electric service becoming more frequent, Tanovic now worries less about 
gathering firewood and more about the seedlings outside her front window. It is 
a plot the Muslim woman shares with her neighbors -- the Serb family upstairs, 
the Croat family downstairs and the mixed-marriage couple across the hall -- an 
unintended but symbolic illustration of the integrated effort to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we saw the war going on, we managed to adapt," she says. But after two 
years of cooking on wood stoves, hunting the hillsides for herbs and other 
taxing ventures, Tanovic, 60, adds wearily, "We hope to God it doesn't go on." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 These recipes, devised to be made with wartime staples, are obviously not 
dishes you would make for entertaining in a land of plenty. But they 
demonstrate the ingenuity of people who refuse to give up living, even in the 
face of extreme adversity.

GARDEN FRESH; BEETS; WHICH SIDE ON ARE YOU ON? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIA THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding beets, there are two camps: those who have never eaten beets and 
intend never to eat them, and those who are mad about beets. I've never met 
anyone simply indifferent to these gorgeous roots. Which leads me to believe 
that if we can coax those who have never tasted beets into tasting them, we can 
pull the naysayers into our camp. 
</P>
<P>
 What are the reasons for being anti-beet? 
</P>
<P>
 Could it be all that scarlet? Scarlet's a passionate color and some people may 
not care for passion in their food -- blood-red oranges, a favorite around the 
Mediterranean, have never caught on here, perhaps for the same reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus we might entice the anti-beets with golden beets. Golden beets are the 
color of sunshine, with buttery sweetness red beets can't match. In a salad 
bowl, mix grated raw golden beets with orange chunks, rings of red onion, a 
handful or two of watercress and curly endive, and toss with olive oil and 
fresh orange juice. When the anti-beet person asks what those delicious shreds 
in the salad are, change the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Or steam golden beets in their jackets until tender, slice them into 
matchsticks and sprinkle chopped fresh dill on top. Or serve hot golden beets 
with butter and chopped candied ginger. Only when the anti-beet is frantic to 
know what glorious vegetable it is, confess. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it may be that golden beets are too vivid still for the introverted. Then 
bring out the cool white beets. Albina Vereduna is heir to the pale beets 
Europeans have loved for centuries. Its leaves are particularly splendid. 
Steam, cool and slice equal parts white beets and White Rose potatoes into a 
pottery bowl. Add lots of finely chopped Italian parsley. Toss with your 
favorite oil and vinegar dressing, to which you added minced flat fillets of 
anchovies. 
</P>
<P>
 You can also combine slices of hot white beets with chopped fresh mint, 
chopped shallots, shallot leaves and orange calendula or nasturtium petals. 
Dress with extra-virgin olive oil and mild vinegar. 
</P>
<P>
 For an especially tough anti-beet try simmered white beets thinly sliced, 
moistened with cream and sprinkled with mace or nutmeg. That should do it. 
</P>
<P>
 It's possible that it's not out of timidity or dread of passion that beets are 
spurned. Maybe it's large plain round rough market roots that are perceived as 
boring. Then serve ultra-sweet candy-apple-red Chioggias. Steam them whole, the 
size of small plums, and present them drizzled with honey and lemon juice. When 
your anti-beet cuts a slice and discovers a peppermint-striped pinwheel in the 
center, we've won. 
</P>
<P>
 Or perhaps the won't-eat-beets person is one of exquisite sensibilities and 
gargantuan roots are unappealing. Then offer Little Ball beets, smooth and 
sweet. Enjoy them cool as a separate course served in small glass bowls heaped 
with slivers of lemon zest and a dollop of creme frache on the side. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Of course, there are those in the anti-beet contingent who have eaten beets 
once or twice, beets far from where they were grown, beets with fibrous texture 
and muddy taste. Rather than try to convince these people that today's freshly 
harvested beets are heavenly, pull out a secret weapon. No one can resist the 
rich succulent sweetness of beets simply scrubbed and set in an earthenware 
dish, drizzled with walnut oil, and roasted in a moderate oven until tender (an 
hour or more). The roots will be wizened, but one bite . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Then we mustn't forget the greens! Until a few hundred years ago, beets' roots 
were spindly and the vegetable was grown for its leaves. Kissing cousin to 
chard, today's beets have the best of both ends -- a plump sweet tender fine 
grained root and lush plush tender leaves. The leaves are delicious and far 
more nutritious than the roots. The best way to serve them -- past chopping 
them into a Slavic beet borscht -- is to pull the green parts off the stems, if 
they're tough, and steam the greens in the water that clings to them from 
rinsing, in the manner of spinach. A little olive oil, lemon juice and garlic 
are all they need. The leaves are also delicious raw in salads. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're one of us who love beets, start them in very early spring when you 
sow peas. In the hot interior parts of Southern California, sow from late 
winter to mid-spring, then again in August -- through the heat of the summer, 
try growing beets in pots set in a cool part of the garden. In citrus climates, 
sow from mid-winter till early summer. Along the coast, you can sow beets from 
mid-winter through early autumn. For a continuous supply, tuck in a short row 
here and there every two weeks or so. For beets through winter, sow deep purple 
Lutz Winter Keeper in early July and harvest big sweet roots in early October. 
Layer them in cool moist sand and keep in a dark place below 45 degrees. In the 
coldest parts of Southern California, in mid-October, you can sow again and 
mulch with straw. The seeds will slumber through winter, then rouse come spring 
and give you the earliest possible crop.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In the landscape, you won't see more of beets than the rounded top of their 
roots, but the perky leaves are delightful. Mix beets among dwarf dahlias 
(either from seeds or from the nursery). Dahlias come in yellow, red, pink, 
purple, orange, scarlet and cream -- gay against the ruffled deep green to 
purple leaves with scarlet or green veins and stalks. Set young dahlias three 
feet apart and fill in with fast-growing baby beets like Little Ball. Sow the 
seeds about two dozen per square foot, patting them in firmly. When the 
seedlings are three inches tall, start thinning. Thinnings of tiny leaves are 
lovely in a grated carrot salad. Thin to an inch apart, then harvest when the 
babies are 3/4 inch across. For maximum fineness in larger cultivars, I never 
let beets get past two inches. Carefully pull beets furthest from the dahlias 
-- as you harvest, the dahlias will fill in, leaving no gaps in the border.  
</P>
<P>
 Beets do best in full sun in humus-y soil on the alkaline side, kept moist but 
not sopping. Beets are slow to germinate, but you can harvest two months from 
sowing. Few pests bother beets, although some insects love to nibble the 
leaves. A floating row cover (from the garden supply) will keep them off. 
</P>
<P>
 Beets do beautifully in containers 6 to 12 inches deep filled with a 
well-draining soil mix. Sun and water requirements are the same. In a big pot, 
add a petunia and trailing blue lobelia. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In the unlikely event that the anti-beets aren't moved by all your tasty 
offerings, get them to grow their own. All of those mentioned grow easily, but 
the superb hybrid Red Ace is ideal for beginners. One taste of these gems fresh 
from the garden, and the hold-outs will say they knew beets were sublime all 
along. Sources

 Cook red beets whole, leaving the root tip and a couple of inches of stalks on 
so the color won't seep out of the roots -- goldens and whites don't bleed. 
Steaming whole beets or simmering them in salted water can take from 30 minutes 
for small ones to an hour for larger beets. They may be cooked in advance and 
reheated without harm.

 We all have a sentimental attachment to certain foods from childhood. At the 
Eunice Knight Saunders School, we were served Harvard beets for lunch every 
Wednesday. I was in the second grade, and it was my first taste of the 
fascinating play of sour/sweet flavors found in Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, 
and Asian cuisines. And I loved the red. The dish is said to be more than 60 
years old; the color comes from Harvard University's crimson. My California 
version is dazzling strawberry -- orange juice fixes the color. These are as 
good with older beets as with babies. This is a delicious plate-brightener with 
pale fish and potatoes. Apples in any form are great with beets, so drink cold 
cider with the supper. Add a salad of celery hearts for crunch (olive oil and 
lemon juice), then for company, a dessert of cheesecake.  
</P>
<P>
 CALIFORNIA HARVARD BEETS 1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch 1/3 cup water 2/3 cup 
fresh orange juice 1 tablespoon rice vinegar or other mild vinegar 1 tablespoon 
sugar 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 3 cups tender-cooked beets, either babies, 
or larger beets cut in small chunks, about 1 pound Salt Freshly ground pepper 
Chopped flat-leaf parsley or chervil 
</P>
<P>
 In medium-large non-reactive saucepan, whisk cornstarch and water until 
smooth. Add splash of orange juice and bring to simmer over medium-high heat, 
whisking frequently. After mixture thickens, turn heat to low and stir 1 to 2 
minutes to cook cornstarch. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove from heat. Whisk while slowly adding vinegar, sugar and remaining 
orange juice. Add butter in flakes. Stir in beets and either cover and set in 
cool place until time to reheat, or return to burner until beets are heated 
through. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Turn into serving dish. Sprinkle 
with parsley to taste. Makes 4 servings.

 Perhaps you didn't know June is Turkey-Lover's Month. So says the National 
Turkey Federation, which is putting its money where its mouth is with a turkey 
recipe contest.The winner (recipe must use at least one pound of turkey meat) 
gets $2,500; for more information, write to the federation at 11319 Sunset 
Hills Road, Reston, Va. 22090. Deadline is July 30, so you actually get to work 
on your recipe a little during July, which is possibly Ahi Tuna-Lover's Month. 
Pavlova: It's Tutu Divine

<P>
 The Pavlova, Australia's chief contribution to world cuisine to date, was 
created 68 years ago to honor the famous ballerina Anna Pavlova when she danced 
"Swan Lake" Down Under. It's cholesterol- and gluten-free, like a huge 
marshmallow in a meringue crust crowned with fruit. The easy way to make it is 
to add water and sugar to an Australian product called Pavlova Magic, available 
at specialty stores such as Bristol Farms and Louis Foods in Pasadena. Hard 
Times for Cod 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two years the Canadians have essentially stopped fishing for 
northern cod. One reason: The Russians are flooding world markets with cod. 
Even so, U. S. fastfood outlets have largely switched to lower priced fish such 
as pollock and hoki.

 After a century of being the most heavily planted grape in California, 
Zinfandel was nosed out by Cabernet in 1992, 34,567 acres to 34,142.The race is 
still still on, though. Even though 773 acres of Cabernet were planted last 
year, the state Cabernet total only reached 34,933 acres because vines infested 
with the new strain of root louse (phylloxera) and other ailments were taken 
out. Meanwhile, Zinfandel climbed to 35,341 acres. DAN BERGER

SCHOOL LUNCH REFORM: NO STRAIGHT A'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The long-awaited federal proposal on reforming government-subsidized school 
lunches was criticized on several fronts even before its formal release 
Wednesday in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, which was hailed as a major reform by U.S. Department of Agriculture 
officials, actually did not address some of the most controversial aspects of 
food service in the nation's elementary and secondary schools. An estimated 25 
million government subsidized lunches are served each day to 54% of the 
nation's school children. 
</P>
<P>
 Left untouched by the 123-page proposed regulation was the presence of 
fast-food chains on campuses; the widespread availability of soda, candy and 
junk food vending machines, and the continued serving of whole milk as opposed 
to reduced-fat versions. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, after a final 90-day public-comment period, is scheduled to go into 
effect for the 1998-1999 school year. The implementation period was called 
reasonable by representatives of school lunch workers, but nutrition activists 
decried it as far too long a phase-in. Some critics disagreed with the 
philosophy behind the reform; others felt that the plan has too many 
inconsistencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The key component of the "Nutrition Objectives for School Meals" is a 
requirement that the meals served students -- eligible for federal assistance 
-- meet the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal among the guidelines are recommendations on reducing fat, saturated 
fat and cholesterol in the typical American diet. They state that fat as a 
percentage of total calories should not exceed 30% per day. Saturated-fat 
content should not be in excess of 10% of the day's calories. And cholesterol 
should be limited to 300 milligrams daily. 
</P>
<P>
 For the purposes of the federal school lunch program, the meals served during 
the course of a week are to be averaged in order to determine if they meet the 
guidelines. States are being asked to enforce the regulation and to determine 
whether schools seeking federal meal assistance meet the new regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 USDA appeared to exempt itself from complying with the dietary guidelines. The 
department sidestepped the issue of whether USDA should distribute to schools 
only those surplus agricultural commodities that meet the dietary guidelines. 
Some of the commodities currently distributed are butter, cheese and meat. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, USDA's own data indicates that reduced-fat meals are not popular 
with students. The proposal states, for instance, that about 40% of schools 
currently offer lunches that meet the dietary guidelines, yet "few" children or 
teens select the meals. Current data also indicate that when fat content of 
meals is reduced below 32%, there is a corresponding 6% drop in the number of 
children choosing such lunches. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got real problems with what they are proposing," said Rod Leonard, 
executive director of the Community Nutrition Institute, a Washington-based 
consumer advocacy group. "The issue for school children, especially children in 
primary and secondary schools, is (that) they are still in a growing phase. The 
single most important nutrient they require is calories. . . . Government 
policy should focus on adequate caloric intake till the child has finished his 
or her growth phase. If we adopt other criteria and goals, then we will create 
an increased risk to health that is unnecessary in those age groups." 
</P>
<P>
 Suzanne Kordesh, a nutrition specialist who works with school districts in 
Oakland, San Jose and Alameda, agreed that providing adequate calories for 
growth was an issue in reformulating school lunches. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are watching that," she said. "When you reduce fat, then you reduce the 
calories and you need to make up for that loss in other ways . . . such as 
serving more fruit, vegetables and whole grains." 
</P>
<P>
 School food-service officials have testified at four hearings, held to gather 
public comment on the proposal, that the new guidelines will make it difficult 
to serve ethnic meals to children and that the low-fat regimen may increase the 
amount of plate waste. 
</P>
<P>
 "Student behavior needs to be addressed (in this reform), as well as what is 
served or what appears on the menu," said Kevin Dando, government affairs 
manager for the American School Food Service Assn. in Alexandria, Va. "This 
needs to be done carefully so that the changes do not drive students from the 
school lunch program to vending machines." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to the plan, USDA is not "proposing any specific provision on fast 
food . . . at this time." And the department stated that requiring that low- or 
nonfat milk be served in school in place of whole milk, with a 4% fat content, 
can only be changed by an act of Congress. The issue of vending machines was 
not addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "From our point of view, all items (whether fast-food meals or whole milk) 
should meet the federal dietary guidelines. Certainly it is unfortunate that 
the issue of whole milk is not addressed in this regulation," said Tricia 
Obester, spokeswoman for Public Voice for Food & Health Policy, a 
Washington-based advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
 Obester said that legislation introduced in Congress by Sen. Patrick Leahy 
(D-Vt.) addresses the issues of whole milk, fast food and vending machines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope when USDA officials testify before Congress on this issue that they 
will highlight how inconsistent it is to continue to offer whole milk at 
cafeterias when they are trying to pare down the fat content of school 
lunches," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Public Voice has also been critical of the four-year phase-in for the school 
lunch reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school lunch program needed drastic change but there is no reason that it 
should take four more years to implement these change," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A coalition of consumer and health advocacy groups petitioned USDA to 
implement the reforms for the 1995-1996 school year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no reason USDA should be so far behind," Obester said.

GOOD COOKING: LOOKING FOR A FEW GOOD CALORIES

<P>
 Lowering fat consumption is not an easy thing to accomplish. Not only does fat 
make everything taste better, but it is an essential ingredient in many foods 
we covet. 
</P>
<P>
 Moderation is the key in any diet, especially where fat is concerned. I have 
found that, in a typical baked-goods recipe that calls for several eggs, one 
egg yolk will often do. As we know, egg yolks are the source of much fat in 
baking. This is how the formula generally works: I use just one egg yolk and at 
least an equal volume of egg whites to substitute for the total volume of whole 
eggs. (Two egg whites equal one egg.) 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, I use cake flour instead of all-purpose flour. Cake flour is a 
fine-textured, soft-wheat flour with a high starch content, producing very 
tender results in baking. Be aware that cake flour weighs less than all-purpose 
flour (one cup of cake flour is four ounces; one cup of all-purpose flour is 
five ounces). 
</P>
<P>
 Low-fat buttermilk also gives fat-restrained recipes great flavor and a light 
texture. Canola oil can often be substituted for butter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The following recipes for waffles, muffins and chocolate cake have lowered fat 
content but still smack of their expected goodness. Once you have tried them, 
you can apply the same adjustments to your own favorite baked goods. 
</P>

 Crisp outside and soft inside, these waffles are enticing on the breakfast 
table. The batter can be refrigerated overnight, but it is best used when the 
beaten egg whites are just folded in.  
</P>
<P>
 CRISPY WAFFLES 2 1/2 cups cake flour 3 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 
Sugar 1 large egg yolk 2 cups buttermilk 2 tablespoons canola oil 3 large egg 
whites Sliced strawberries, optional Maple syrup, warmed, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Sift together flour, baking powder, salt and 3 tablespoons sugar in large 
bowl. Beat egg yolk in small bowl. Stir in buttermilk and oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Beat egg whites in separate bowl with electric mixer until stiff but not dry. 
</P>
<P>
 Add yolk-buttermilk mixture to flour mixture. Stir just until moistened. Do 
not overmix. Fold in egg whites with rubber spatula. 
</P>
<P>
 Lightly spray waffle iron with oil. Heat waffle iron. When hot, pour 1/2 to 1 
cup batter on iron. Close iron and bake until waffle is browned and steam no 
longer escapes from iron, about 4 to 5 minutes. Do not make waffles too thick. 
</P>
<P>
 Serve hot. Sprinkle strawberries with sugar to taste and place on top of 
waffles. Serve with warm maple syrup. Makes 5 to 6 waffles.

 Father's Day is just around the corner. But some fathers can't indulge in the 
huge holiday breakfasts they used to love. That doesn't mean you can't plan a 
special brunch for Dad. 
</P>
<P>
 This low-fat version of scrambled eggs Europa is quick and easy to prepare. 
Only a small amount of sausage (turkey instead of pork) is added for flavor to 
sauteed onions and peppers, so there isn't a lot of added fat. 
</P>
<P>
 After the sausage is cooked, nonfat egg substitute is stirred in. With the 
flavor of the garlic, onions, peppers and sausage, Dad will never know these 
eggs are not eggs from the shell. The nonfat egg substitute cooks best when 
allowed to set on the bottom of the pan each time before gently folding over 
the eggs. This allows the uncooked portion to flow to the bottom of the 
skillet. 
</P>
<P>
 Serve eggs topped with plain yogurt, a touch of mustard and a sprinkling of 
paprika. Round out the brunch with toasted French bread, sliced tomatoes and 
fresh fruit. SAVORY BRUNCH EGGS 1 teaspoon oil 1 large onion, chopped 1 clove 
garlic, minced 1/4 sweet red pepper, chopped 1/4 sweet green pepper, chopped 
1/4 sweet yellow pepper, chopped 1/4 pound turkey sausage, casing removed (1 
link) Salt, pepper 2 (8-ounce) cartons nonfat egg substitute (equivalent to 8 
eggs) Nonfat plain yogurt or nonfat sour cream, optional Horseradish mustard, 
optional Hungarian paprika, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Place oil in non-stick skillet and add onion and garlic. Saute over medium 
heat onion begins to brown, about 10 minutes. Add red, green and yellow sweet 
peppers and continue to saute until tender. Add turkey sausage and saute, 
stirring and breaking up sausage, until cooked.  
</P>
<P>
 Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add nonfat egg substitute. Cook and stir 
as for scrambled eggs, letting eggs cook until set before gently stirring each 
time. Divide onto serving dishes. Garnish with yogurt and mustard. Sprinkle 
with paprika to taste. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving, without yogurt and mustard garnish, includes about: 109 
calories; 360 mg sodium; 12 mg cholesterol; 3 grams fat; 6 grams carbohydrates; 
14 grams protein; 0.22 grams fiber.

OUR COMPLEMENTS TO THE PROTEIN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ceci e pasta was a favorite Friday-night dinner when I was growing up. More a 
thick soup than a pasta dish, it was eaten out of shallow soup plates with 
large soup spoons. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, I'm sure that my mother wasn't aware of the term "complementary 
proteins" or the now slightly outdated notion of eating two incomplete 
(vegetable) proteins in one dish in order to get the nutritional benefit of a 
complete (meat) protein. But she did know that pasta and beans made a wholesome 
combination. She also knew that we loved it. 
</P>
<P>
 My version of ceci e pasta is slightly different from the dish I grew up with. 
We always had made it with small elbow macaroni, and because I don't remember 
it being red with tomatoes, I suspect Mom used a combination of undrained 
canned ceci beans (also known as garbanzo beans or chick peas) and a ladle full 
of the pasta cooking water for the liquid. Because I love the salty starch 
taste, I still use the pasta cooking water, but I have added canned Italian 
tomatoes, and I use small shell pasta instead of elbows. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Round out the menu with a simple room-temperature broccoli, lemon and olive 
oil side dish. For dessert, serve an Italian-style orange ice, called orange 
granita because of its grainy consistency. CECI E PASTA 1/4 cup extra-virgin 
olive oil 1 medium onion, chopped 3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 1/2 carrot, 
chopped 1 (28-ounce) can Italian plum tomatoes with juice 1 (16-ounce) garbanzo 
beans (ceci beans), rinsed and drained 1 (16-ounce) package small pasta shells 
Salt 1 cup pasta cooking liquid 1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley Freshly 
grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese 
</P>
<P>
 Combine oil, onion, garlic and carrot in large skillet. Cook over low heat, 
stirring, until onion is tender, about 10 minutes. Do not brown. Add tomatoes 
with juice and garbanzo beans. Simmer over low heat about 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile cook pasta in plenty of boiling salted water until al dente, or 
almost tender. Reserve about 1 cup pasta cooking liquid. Drain pasta and 
immediately stir pasta into skillet with garbanzo beans. Add enough reserved 
pasta cooking liquid for extra moisture. Mixture is supposed to be very juicy. 
Sprinkle with parsley and cheese. Pass extra cheese to sprinkle on each 
serving. Makes 4 generous servings. BROCCOLI WITH LEMON AND OLIVE OIL 1 bunch 
broccoli, thick ends trimmed, cut into florets with stems separated lengthwise 
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, or more to taste Kosher salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 lemon, cut into wedges 
</P>
<P>
 Place broccoli in steamer basket and set over boiling water. Cover and steam 
until tender, about 8 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 Transfer broccoli to serving platter. Drizzle with olive oil and salt to 
taste. Garnish with lemon wedges. Squeeze juice from lemon wedge over each 
portion when served. Can serve immediately or at room temperature. Makes 4 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This dessert is also delicious when made with tangerine juice. Fresh juice is 
preferred, of course, but if there isn't time to squeeze fresh juice, frozen is 
an acceptable substitute.  
</P>
<P>
 ORANGE GRANITA 1 cup boiling water 1/3 cup sugar 2 cups orange juice 1 
tablespoon fresh lemon juice 1 teaspoon grated orange zest 
</P>
<P>
 Stir together boiling water and sugar until sugar is dissolved. Stir in orange 
and lemon juices and grated orange zest. Stir to blend. Pour mixture into 
shallow metal pan and freeze until slushy. Stir well. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeze until firm enough to mound, 1 to 2 hours, depending on temperature of 
freezer. Spoon into wine glasses and serve. Makes 4 servings.

IN THE KITCHEN; A DAB WILL DO YOU

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some people, when they think of San Francisco, think of the Golden Gate 
Bridge, cute little trolley cars or City Lights book store.  
</P>
<P>
 When I think of San Francisco, I think of fish houses. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco has fish houses in the same way Detroit has chop houses -- 
honest places that use the honest ingredients. Places like Tadich's or Sam's, 
with old dark wood walls and professional waiters who have been at work for 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 At these places they wouldn't dream of serving mesquite-grilled ahi with 
cherry-chipotle salsa. This isn't food that screams "Look at me!" 
</P>
<P>
 The dishes are cooked simply -- poached, broiled or sauteed -- and served 
plainly -- usually adorned with nothing more than butter, lemon and a little 
parsley. Side dishes are the likes of boiled parsleyed new potatoes and creamed 
spinach. 
</P>
<P>
 And the fish itself is simple too. Rarely do you see anything exotic from warm 
waters. Mostly, there is sole. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, none of the West Coast flat fish are true soles, they are all 
members of the halibut family, specific to this side of the continent. But 
that's a matter of nomenclature, having nothing to do with taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the whole halibut bunch, I think sand dabs are my favorite. Rex sole is 
very good and, of course, so is the California halibut itself. But for my 
taste, sand dabs are the best eating, with their sweet sea flesh offset by a 
distinctive iodine-y edge. 
</P>
<P>
 They're also the most difficult to eat. Because the sand dabs are the smallest 
of the flat fish, each fillet has a thin, spiny-looking bone running its length 
(the fillets are so small there would be nothing left if they were boned before 
cooking). Though this looks like a backbone, it is actually the long set of 
feather bones that attaches the dorsal fins to the fish. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a nice little headwaiter's trick to getting rid of them. After the 
fish are cooked, run a knife down the middle of the fillet on the top side. 
Using a dull knife or a fork, push aside the meat on either side of the cut, 
dividing the meat neatly into two pieces. Grab one end of the exposed bone with 
your hand and gently lift, running the knife or fork underneath to separate the 
meat. Lift away the bone and you're done. 
</P>
<P>
 With this kind of fish, I think the simplest cooking is the best. And 
nothing's simpler than a saute meuniere (a French term said to refer to a 
miller's wife -- flour is certainly involved). 
</P>
<P>
 Pat the fish dry, dredge it lightly in flour (pat it between your hands to 
remove the excess) and saute it quickly. Remove the fish to a warm platter and 
cover. Then simply brown a little butter to use as a sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 It couldn't be easier. And the best thing is, it means you really don't need 
San Francisco at all. SAND DABS MEUNIERE 2 pounds cleaned sand dab fillets Salt 
2 tablespoons oil 6 tablespoons butter Flour Juice 1/2 lemon 
</P>
<P>
 Pat fillets dry on both sides with paper towel. Sprinkle lightly with salt to 
taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil and 2 tablespoons butter in wide skillet, preferably nonstick, over 
medium-high heat. Put flour on plate. Lightly dip 1 fillet at time in flour on 
both sides, then shake off excess. Lay fillets in hot skillet. Repeat until 
skillet is fairly full, being careful not to crowd fillets. Fry until 
light-brown, 4 to 5 minutes, then turn fillets and finish cooking on other 
side, another 3 to 4 minutes. Remove cooked fillets to paper towels and keep 
warm in oven. Repat until all fillets are cooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove pan from heat and wipe clean with paper towels. Put remaining 1/4 cup 
butter in pan and cook over medium heat. Butter will foam, foam will subside, 
then butter will begin to brown and smell nutty. Remove pan from heat and add 
lemon juice. While butter is cooking, arrange sand dabs on warmed platter. Pour 
butter sauce over sand dabs and serve immediately. Makes 6 servings.

18 grams fat; 4 grams carbohydrates; 23 grams protein; 0.01 grams fiber.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: MOLLUSK MADNESS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Honduras Kitchen is a splendid little place on the western edge of Huntington 
Park, alive with the fragrance of onions and frying meat. One wall is covered 
with a mural of a mythically beautiful Honduran rancho; the other side of the 
room is lined with Honduran travel posters labeled with handwritten tags. There 
is a rustic eave over the cash register, soccer flyers on the counter, and a 
framed collection of Honduran money by the door. The restaurant feels as if it 
is on the other side of the world, but over surface streets it is only a 
10-minute drive from downtown. Though Los Angeles teems with restaurants 
serving Salvadoran, Nicaraguan and Guatemalan food, this may be the only 
Honduran place in town. 
</P>
<P>
 The single-item restaurant thrives in the Southland: Chili John's for a bowl 
of red, Lawry's for prime rib, Cole's for dipped roast-beef sandwiches, the 
Oyster House for a dozen bluepoints. When you're in the mood for steak, there's 
Taylor's; for bean curd, Beverly Soontofu. There's even a Taiwanese rice-gruel 
joint called Porridge King. 
</P>
<P>
 Painted on the window of Honduras Kitchen, in bold red script, is the legend ' 
'La Casa de la Sopa de Caracol. " Though it serves garlicky grilled pork chops, 
good fried fish, a mushy though flavorful carne asada , the restaurant is 
something of a shrine to the mighty caracol , a Caribbean mollusk that is 
culinarily, if not biologically, identical to the Italian scungilli and the 
Florida conch . . . though the word caracol translates literally as "snail." 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant serves caracoles fried in crisp batter, doused with citrus and 
grilled until they resemble a sort of veal piccata of the sea. They also come 
raw in spicy cocktails and boiled in the restaurant's famous soup. At Sunday 
lunch, over the blare of salsa music, over the din of conversation and wailing 
babies, is the thwack- thwack thwack- thwack of somebody in the kitchen 
pounding caracoles to chewy, abalone-like tenderness. As far as I know, this 
sort of mollusk single-mindedness has not been equaled in the Los Angeles area 
since the Bahamian conch specialty joint down on Pico went out of business a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Before lunch come French-fry basketsful of paper-thin sliced green plantains, 
tajadas , fried to a shattering crispness, like good, vaguely fruity potato 
chips. Tajadas de carne molida involves a bed of the fried plantains topped 
with cabbage slaw and a mound of a blandish ground-meat stew; tajadas de 
chicharrones includes the cabbage but replaces the beef with crunchy pieces of 
fried pigskin, like a Honduran version of the Nicaraguan vigoron . Baliadas are 
thick flour tortillas folded over a filling of pureed beans and thick Honduran 
cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Sopa de caracol is a spectacular bowl of soup -- chowder really -- with gentle 
broth, milky-white with coconut, slightly sweet, faintly aromatic of bananas 
and of the sea. In its tropical lushness, sopa de caracol seems almost less 
like the cooking of neighboring Central American countries than it does like 
some Southeast Asian soup, perhaps Thai, with many fewer chiles. In the broth 
are starchy slabs of potatoes, cassava and plantains; long-cooked carrots and 
bell peppers, and a great mound of sliced conch meat, which is chewy -- though 
not excessively so -- and has a sweet marine flavor far milder than that of a 
clam.  
</P>
<P>
 The other unusual soup here is tapado , also based on coconut milk but 
spicier, tinted red with chiles, and featuring chunks of Honduran "dried" beef, 
which gives the soup an astonishing complexity but whose gaminess can at first 
be off-putting. Arroz con pollo is an astonishing thing -- closer to 
Cuban-Chinese fried rice than to a Mexican arroz con pollo -- a bowl-shaped, 
delicious, slightly oily mountain of stuff, garnished with strips of grilled 
ham and American cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 If you decide to have dessert, pastel Hondureno is more or less like a slice 
of yellow birthday cake, vaca negra is a root-beer float, but arroz con leche 
is one of the best rice puddings around, rich, creamy, not too sweet, just the 
thing to top off a caracol afternoon. Honduras Kitchen

BOOK REVIEW; GERMAN FOOD LIGHTENS UP; THE NEW GERMAN COOKBOOK: MORE THAN 230 
CONTEMPORARY AND TRADITIONAL RECIPES, BY JEAN ANDERSON AND HEDY WURZ ;

<P>
 Time was when some bastions of German cooking enjoyed real international 
renown. But not in very recent time. The great hotels of the casino towns, spas 
and Hansa ports were at their zenith before World War I. At tony pre-Depression 
men's clubs, wealthy Berliners dined as augustly as wealthy Londoners. Between 
the wars, Alfred Walterspiel, among the reigning European chefs of his age, 
presided over a celebrated kitchen at the Four Seasons Hotel in Munich. And 
then -- well, when postwar America started busily "discovering" that people 
knew how to cook in a zillion other parts of the world, the food of Germany was 
mostly ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning back enough eclat to reach American awareness took a while, though a 
canny observer could have guessed that the territory pictured in Mimi 
Sheraton's fine "The German Cookbook" (published in 1965 and still an endlessly 
pleasurable introduction) was no kitchen wasteland. In time, food professionals 
who read the language began seeking out first-rate publications from West 
Germany (for a long time a center of interesting food photography and reference 
works). In the 1970s and '80s, glowing reports and Michelin stars signaled the 
rising trajectories of a few bright young post- nouvelle chefs. American and 
even French tourists at last began to visit Munich in quest of drop-dead 
elegant restaurants. Around the time of reunification, a New Yorker cartoon 
fantasized a Berlin-style cafe as the next wave of Manhattan chic. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Anderson and Hedy Wurz's enjoyable new survey clearly acknowledges the 
current wave of glamour, but without the too-familiar tactic of ignorantly 
brushing aside anything more ancient than last Thursday. Their take on the 
"new" German scene capably steers between reportorial judgment of recent 
developments and home cooks' personal gleanings. Different insular 
possibilities of the subject are firmly rejected. This isn't a trend-spotters' 
Germany of gaudy invention or a pretentious archaizers' Germany of supposed 
Ur-ingredients. It is also a long way from the Reformhaus, the health-food 
store, which has many earnest Teutonic devotees -- or the very, very German 
wonderland of everything canned, powdered and instantized. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What's left is far from negative despite the absence of some illustrious 
traditional specialties like steak tartare, May wine, Rapunzel (mache) salad, 
or fruit compotes. The Anderson-Wurz new Germany rapidly defines itself as a 
domain of pleasant hobby-cooks and chefs from whom the old Deutsche Ku che 
blends naturally into newer styles. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the roughly 215 recipes, most could be described as "traditional, with a 
difference." A very few are the kind of opulent presentations that might grace 
stylish restaurant menus anywhere from Brussels to Seattle -- for example, a 
warm salad of roast squab and julienned vegetables with a dressing based on the 
pan drippings, or a sole-salmon-lobster terrine served with a sorrel-dill 
sauce. More are sturdy old faithfuls like apple-horseradish sauce, boiled beef, 
sauerkraut and apples cooked in Riesling, Zimtsterne (cinnamon stars, without 
which Christmas is hardly official in many households), or Bohnen, Birnen, und 
Speck (green beans, pears, and bacon -- a strange-sounding but venerable 
combination). And many give a traditional dish a minor facelift or whimsical 
spin -- e.g., Bavarian cream with fine pumpernickel crumbs in the custard, some 
filo-wrapped versions of things that would more usually be made with short 
pastry or yeast dough, or chef Eckhart Witzigmann's "Lebkuchen souffle." (This 
has no earthly connection with Lebkuchen, the dense, chewy German equivalent of 
gingerbread, except that it contains some of the same spices.) 
</P>
<P>
 The sort of mix that Anderson and Wurz are after is obvious from a little 
browsing. The appetizer section is almost entirely devoted to fish and seafood, 
anything from miniature potato pancakes prettily adorned with smoked salmon 
rounds or vinegar-marinated raw fish fillets in sour cream-herb sauce to good 
old Rollmops or herring salad. Pungent, smelly cheese spreads of the 
"handcheese" and "cooked cheese" tribes are notably missing. But the authors 
take great pains with the different members of the dumpling family and the 
traditional holiday yeast breads. The bread chapter also investigates 
home-baked non-sweet breads, ignored in the Sheraton book. (Germans 
historically have been able to buy a splendid variety of breads including 
dense, flavorful rye and mixed-grain loaves from their local bakers, who also 
supplied the sourdough starter for those who wanted to make sourdough breads at 
home; from-scratch bread-baking is a relatively new field for sophisticated 
hobby-cooks.) A handful of interesting venison recipes testify to this abiding 
German passion -- in the most unusual, the meat is roasted in a coating of 
pureed chestnuts. The national love of wild mushrooms finds lively expression 
in a sauce for pork medallions, a filling for crepes and a noble-sounding 
combination of asparagus and morels. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One part of the "new German" emphasis strikes me as limiting: the heavy 
reliance on kitchen machinery. Many recipes tie you to an electric mixer or 
food processor without mentioning hand methods as alternatives, even for 
something as simple as pureeing raspberries. I also wish that the many mentions 
of "rich beef broth (preferably homemade)" in ingredients lists had moved 
someone to provide a recipe for the characteristic German beef broth with its 
interesting accents of celery root, parsley root and leek, a major building 
block of the cuisine for those who don't joyously substitute that classic 
German expedient, the Suppenwurfel (bouillon cube). Another minor annoyance for 
people who grew up on the German name of some old favorite is that the index 
almost wholly omits German terms, even for such familiar dishes as Hasenpfeffer 
or Maultaschen. (Sheraton's "German Cookbook" has separate German and English 
indices, a nice touch that few publishers would spring for nowadays.) 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Anderson and Wurz provide a long and intelligent glossary 
of German culinary terms that's almost a book's worth of information in its own 
right. This volume also has a good chapter on German wine and beer by the late 
Lamar Elmore, an unintimidating primer for those ordinarily driven up the wall 
by words like Trockenbeerenauslese.  
</P>
<P>
 Jean Anderson's reputation for clear, reliable directions was amply borne out 
by my three cooking experiments. A full-flavored but surprisingly subtle mussel 
soup was a good example of an approach that seems to be frequent here: making 
use of rich ingredients like cream and egg yolks without apology but also in a 
decidedly careful, restrained manner to give the suggestion of creaminess 
rather than a lushly opulent texture. Onions hollowed out and baked with a 
savory pork filling had the faint bittersweet headiness of the dark beer used 
to finish the sauce. Best of all were braised veal shanks -- not left in one 
piece as they often are in German treatments of this cut, but sawed into rounds 
osso buco-style and served with a rich, intense sour cream sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The great attention of this book is that it is soundly enough rooted in 
traditional cooking to please those loyal to past memories, shrewdly enough 
geared to the cosmopolitan present to make prejudiced American cooks take a 
second look at "that soggy German cooking," but not heavy-handed in pursuit of 
either goal. Many -- if not most -- of the familiar areas are covered more 
thoroughly in Mimi Sheraton's book, but Anderson and Wurz excel in discreet, 
uncontrived originality.

 Great artichokes aren't raised to be supporting players next to a chicken 
breast. They should be the stars of a dinner menu. 
</P>
<P>
 The following mixture of garlic, prosciutto, Parmesan cheese and basil is just 
the stuffing a prize artichoke richly deserves. 
</P>
<P>
 The dish can easily be turned into a vegetarian one if you use vegetable broth 
in place of the chicken broth and substitute chopped, smoked almonds for the 
prosciutto. PROSCIUTTO-STUFFED ARTICHOKES 2 large artichokes Salt 1 clove 
garlic, smashed 2 rounded tablespoons bread crumbs 1 tablespoon chopped parsley 
1 shallot, minced 1 ounce prosciutto, minced 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan 
cheese 1 tablespoon minced fresh basil 1 egg yolk 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground 
white pepper 1/2 cup chicken broth 1 tablespoon olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 Trim pointed tips off artichokes. Trim off stems. Place artichokes in pan of 
salted, boiling water with garlic. Cook at low boil until tender, about 40 
minutes. Discard water and garlic. 
</P>

 "I've never seen a waif consume a pound of Brie in less than five minutes 
before," says Michele Economou, "but it happened that night." 
</P>
<P>
 Economou knows that most mannequins aren't the finicky eaters everybody thinks 
they are. Sure, they eat lots of fresh fruit and vegetables, but the 
pencil-thin figures also gobble up platters of lasagna, spicy sausages, even 
brownies. As caterer for Prima Modeling Agency, Economou's even gotten used to 
the body-builder types who won't touch anything. "All they talk about is body 
fat," she says. "It makes me want to run straight to Taco Bell." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, when Economou catered Detour magazine's seventh-anniversary party 
last month, the Brie binging took her off-guard, mostly because more hungry 
style scenesters showed up than she expected. Co-hosted by Prima and Photo 
Impact, a photography laboratory specializing in black-and-white printing, the 
party, held at the lab's small gallery, featured an exhibition of the 70 best 
photos that had run in the fashion magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was told it would be a cocktail party for 300, and supposedly these people 
were going to be eating light," Economou says. "Instead, 700 turned out, and it 
ended up being a Weight Watchers escapee free-for-all." 
</P>
<P>
 Before Economou could set up the food, which had been trucked over from the 
Prima kitchen around the corner, the fashion mavens began tearing the plastic 
wrap off the trays and snatching hors d'oeuvres. They grabbed the stuffed grape 
leaves, the miniature spanakopita , the cheese, the antipasti , the eggplant 
terrines. And then they gorged on the platters of bread pudding.  
</P>
<P>
 "We worked 72 hours straight, and we barely had enough food," says Economou. 
"I learned a lot from this one." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 This eggplant terrine served at the Detour party is very beautiful, and not 
difficult to make. It can be sliced and served at room temperature, or chilled 
and served in a sandwich.  
</P>
<P>
 EGGPLANT TERRINE 2 large eggplants Roasted Sweet Red Peppers 1 1/2 cups 
ricotta cheese 1 1/2 cups goat cheese 2 teaspoons lemon juice Olive oil 3 
tablespoons chopped mixed fresh herbs 1 large bunch basil Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Cut eggplant horizontally into slices 1/2-inch thick. Purge eggplant by 
standing 1 layer of slices upright against inside of colander and sprinkle with 
salt. Repeat process until all eggplant is salted. Place deep-dish under 
colander to collect drippings. Let eggplant stand about 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Prepare Roasted Sweet Red Peppers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cream ricotta, goat cheese, lemon juice, 2 teaspoons olive oil and mixed herbs 
in medium bowl. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Rinse and pat each eggplant slice dry with paper towels. Brush slices with 
olive oil to taste. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Grill eggplant over 
extremely high heat, approximately 2 minutes on each side, or until 
translucent.  
</P>
<P>
 Line 7-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap. Layer bottom with grilled eggplant. 
Top with 1 layer of cheese mixture. Top cheese mixture with 1 layer of basil 
leaves. Repeat layering until loaf pan is full, ending with eggplant. 
</P>
<P>
 Cover top with plastic wrap and weight down, using milk carton or another loaf 
pan filled with something heavy. Let stand overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 To serve, turn layered mixture onto board and carefully remove plastic wrap. 
Top loaf with Roasted Sweet Red Pepper mixture, then slice. Makes 8 to 12 
servings.

</P>
<P>
 Roasted Sweet Red Peppers 2 large sweet red peppers 1 large clove garlic, 
minced 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Halve peppers lengthwise and remove seeds. Place peppers skin-side-up on 
baking sheet and broil 2 to 3 inches from heat until skins are charred black, 
12 to 15 minutes. Transfer peppers to paper bag, close tightly and let peppers 
steam about 15 minutes. Slip off charred skins. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut peppers into strips and place in flat bowl or pie plate. Sprinkle peppers 
with minced garlic. Drizzle with olive oil and lemon juice. Season to taste 
with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.

WINE: YQUEM: NOW JUST $130 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you asked wine lovers the world over to name the one wine that exceeds all 
others of its type by the greatest margin, surely all would name Chateau 
d'Yquem. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweet white wine of the Sauternes district in Bordeaux is considered best 
of all wines of the region, and it leads the second grouping of great Sauternes 
by such a wide gulf that as far back as 140 years ago, when the Bordeaux region 
was classified, not a single other wine was listed alongside it; it is the only 
wine listed as Grand Premier Cru. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, a good vintage of Yquem (as it's called by the collector set) sells for 
$200 a bottle on a shelf, $250 or more at restaurants. (Almost no one discounts 
this wine, but a few wine shops offer 1988 Yquem at $175; half bottles are $85 
or so.) 
</P>
<P>
 Is Yquem worth it? Oz Clarke, the irreverent Brit who is rarely so 
enthusiastic about a wine, virtually rhapsodized when he described Yquem in the 
latest edition (1993) of his Encyclopedia of Wine: 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . a frantically expensive wine which is nonetheless in constant demand 
because, for sheer richness, for exotic flavours of vanilla, pineapple, melons, 
peaches and coconut, enveloped in a caramel richness so viscous and lush your 
mouth feels coated with succulence for an eternity after swallowing the wine . 
. . for all that, and for the ability to age a decade, a generation, a century 
even, when the wine will be deep, dark brown . . . and will taste of orange 
chocolate, butterscotch, barley sugar and caramel . . . no wine in the world 
can touch Chateau d'Yquem." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All true -- except for the demand part. At least in California. As great a 
wine as Yquem is, the price has been a barrier, especially in an economy not 
yet recovering fast enough to sell caseloads of this wine. Rumors persist that 
quantities of the excellent 1988 Yquem are backlogged in warehouses and that 
sales are slower than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 So slow, in fact, that merchants in the Los Angeles area were surprised 
recently to be told that if they wanted any of the reportedly great 1989 Yquem 
(which will be released this summer), they had to buy two cases of the 1988 
vintage. (Not that there's anything wrong with the '88; in fact, it comes from 
a year ranked among the best ever in Sauternes.) 
</P>
<P>
 This may prove to be a barrier to some merchants, since for three cases of 
this wine they'll have to ante up more than $5,000, with no guarantee they'll 
sell the wine very quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the Comte Alexander de Lur-Saluces, proprietor of Yquem, could well 
argue that he can't sell the wine until nearly five years after the grapes are 
harvested, and even then he'd be making only 42 cases out of acres of vines -- 
about a tenth of what a standard table wine would produce from an acre. This 
works out to about one glass of wine per vine.  
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the painstaking method used to produce this liquid is costly. Add to 
the equation the fact that it is not even possible to make Yquem every year. A 
few months back, Lur-Saluces announced that the 1992 harvest in Sauternes was 
so poor that no Yquem would be made at all, joining 1964, 1972 and 1974 as 
bypassed vintages. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of four vintages in 30 may not seem like much, but consider that even 
in some years when Yquem is made, production is reduced to make the wine good. 
In 1978, for instance, only 15% of a normal crop could be used. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, production of Yquem is so small to make sure it is very good, which 
is the secret to any great wine. But in the case of Yquem, nature limits what 
may be done to make great wine, and there is a very fine line between greatness 
and disaster since the wine is so dependent on a mold developing in the 
vineyard and infecting the grapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Not any mold will do, however. It must be the so-called "noble mold," Botrytis 
cinerea , which pokes tiny holes in the grape skins and allows moisture to 
evaporate slowly, concentrating the sugars in the juice. 
</P>
<P>
 In years when there isn't enough concentration, some producers resort to a 
new, controversial method of winemaking for Sauternes and other sweet wines 
called cryo-extraction. In this technique, the grape juice is chilled to near 
freezing, until ice crystals form. The pressing eliminates the ice, 
theoretically concentrating the resulting wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Lur-Saluces admits he tried the technique in 1986 and 1987, but he didn't like 
the result, so none of the cryo-extraction wine was ever bottled. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Harvesting is also done to maximize the proportion of mold-affected grapes. 
Instead of simply waiting until the vineyard is ripe, pickers go through the 
vineyard any number of times, as many as 12 over a 60-day period, picking only 
the perfectly moldy clusters. And the wine remains in the barrel for some 3 1/2 
years, nearly twice as long as hearty red wine, gaining complexity as it goes.  
</P>
<P>
 "Sauternes, as a category, is a slow-moving wine," says one Westside wine 
merchant. "Sales rise a few percent every year, but you don't have many people 
buying by the case. They buy a bottle or three." 
</P>
<P>
 For those who are eager to try Yquem once in their lives, now is as good a 
time as any. The 1987 vintage, which some considered to be rather poor in 
Sauternes, still produced what I consider an absolutely smashing, spectacular 
Yquem. I love the fresh fruit and balance, and the great acidity to offset the 
high sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1988 is sweeter, but the 1987 is more approachable. It may be found at 
$130 or so per bottle, a relative bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lur-Saluces was in Southern California last week and he previewed the as-yet 
unreleased 1989 Yquem. 
</P>
<P>
 The wine shows wonderful floral notes, but is very difficult to judge right 
now because it lacks the bottle bouquet one would expect from a $200 wine. 
Lur-Saluces says the 1989 vintage had near-perfect weather conditions, and the 
wine is developing nicely. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, I feel the 1987 is the sleeper Yquem to look for, a "bargain," if one 
can use that word about Yquem. 
</P>
<P>
 A few stores still carry some older vintages of Yquem at prices that make it 
possible to consider springing for one. And since half-bottles are far easier 
to buy and use (they contain just 12 1/2 ounces each), they will be well below 
$100. 
</P>
<P>
 A full bottle could well serve two dozen people, with each getting an ounce. 
The aroma and taste are so incredible you don't need much more than that to 
appreciate it. But if you're a real wine lover, you may realize that a full 
bottle of Yquem is barely enough for a couple. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the seductiveness of this most remarkable wine. Wine of the Week 
</P>
<P>
 1993 Queen Adelaide Chardonnay ($7) -- Penfolds, Australia's largest winery 
group, makes wine under a number of brands, all of them good values. This wine, 
a new addition to Penfolds' import list, is made by Seppelts and is the largest 
selling Chardonnay in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 The fruit aroma is like melons and pears, with lime and other citrus elements 
as an intriguing addition. There is no oak aging to muck up the bright, crisp 
fruit, and the aftertaste is so lush and tasty it may be served as an aperitif. 
Also, it goes well with lightly seasoned seafood dishes. (There is a tiny trace 
of residual sugar here, but even the most expert tasters won't be able to 
tell.) A bargain at the above price, but it may be found at some discounters at 
less than $6.

STILL HARD ON LARD

 Regarding "Everything but the Squeal," the author deserves the prize for the 
coldest cook I never want to know. She had a little pet pig, taught him some

 Thank you so much for refreshing my memory on why I no longer subscribe to The 
Times. The April 28 issue was bizarre to the point of gross! Lard, of all 
things, is being touted as a preferred ingredient in recipes? There is no way 
you could convince me that lard is great. Perhaps you have some connection to 
those who make pacemakers and bypass instruments!

 I wholeheartedly agree that lard has gotten a bad rap. Everyone feels so 
virtuous for cutting lard out of their diets, yet they continue with abandon to 
eat foods made with butter. Hypocrisy abounds. I am a waitress in a local 
restaurant and see over and over again holier-than-thou customers who come in 
and order their plain vegetable and fish entrees with no sauce, no seasoning -- 
and no flavor -- whatsoever, then turn around and order the most fatty things 
for dessert!

COD IS GREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROBERTS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dried codfish is a popular staple in Scandinavia, Northern Germany and the 
Mediterranean countries. Why, you may ask, would one want to eat a preserved 
fish when fresh is available? Well, basically because it tastes great, better 
by far than the fresh version. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh cod is not a terribly tasty fish; its flesh is white and mild and tends 
to flake when cooked. It's traditionally been a poor man's fish. In the old 
days, it was about the only fish available for rural people far from either the 
Atlantic or Mediterranean coasts. Especially after the discovery of the New 
World, when the Newfoundland banks supplied most of Europe with an endless 
supply of cod, which was salted aboard ship and brought back to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Long considered unworthy by chefs and gourmands alike, it's stewed, fried, 
mashed, roasted and served in salads by cooks from Portugal to Greece. 
Recently, Parisian chefs have given this homey staple a coup d'elegance , and 
it has become the reverse chic fish of choice. 
</P>
<P>
 It's part of the trend of cooking in the comfortable style of one's grandme re 
. I, myself, have put two versions of it on the menu of my own restaurant in 
Pasadena. I can happily report that both my curried salt cod fritters (called 
acras) and the classic mash of salt cod, olive oil, garlic and potatoes (called 
brandade ), for which I give the recipe here, are literally flying out the 
kitchen door. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are two varieties of this dried delicacy. Stockfish is cod that's been 
gutted and stretched on a stick to dry (The Dutch word for stick is stok ). Cod 
that's been salted and then dried is called baccala in Italy, bacalao in Spain, 
bacalhau in Portugual, bakalarios in Greece and morue in France. 
</P>
<P>
 Salt cod is so common and "old France" that to call a woman a morue is about 
the worst epithet you can use, because it implies that the poor dear is the 
most common of the common, that she is, in fact, completely dispensable. 
</P>
<P>
 The fishmongers in Paris desalt whole fish, beginning on Wednesdays, for 
people to take home and cook on Fridays, still the traditional fish day in 
Catholic countries. And it's the dish of choice for Vendredi Saint, or Good 
Friday, as ubiquitous as an American's Thanksgiving turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional way of salting, then air-drying the cod to a stiff-cardboard 
appearance may not seem appetizing to the uninitiated. Its aroma is 
unmistakable too. But persevere: The flavor is incomparable. In Portuguese and 
Brazilian markets, the fish is found whole. Having to pick through bones and 
skin is probably a bit much for most people to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
 More common is filleted salt cod, whose nice thick fillets have been salted, 
but only partly dried. They are packed in pretty wooden boxes and are often 
sold in the refrigerator case of supermarkets. What they lack in soul, they 
gain in convenience. (I've never found stockfish in any American market.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Salt cod must be soaked in water for at least 48 hours or up to three days 
before being used. Change the water three or four times. The resulting fish is 
creamy, with delicious fresh-tasting flavor -- sweet, not even salty. It's 
often paired with potatoes and tomatoes. The texture of this revived cod 
enables it to absorb oil. In France, it's often pounded into a truly fabulous 
concoction called brandade . SALT COD WITH ONIONS AND POTATOES 1 1/2 pounds 
salt cod, cut into 2- to 3-inch pieces 2 medium onions 4 cloves garlic 1 pound 
large new potatoes 3 tablespoons olive oil 1/4 cup dry vermouth 1 teaspoon 
ground white pepper 1/4 cup sour cream 2 tablespoons chopped parsley 
</P>
<P>
 Two days before preparing brandade, place salt cod in bowl, cover with water 
and place in refrigerator. Change water 3 to 4 times. Drain salt cod and 
discard water. 
</P>
<P>
 Thinly slice onions and garlic. Peel potatoes and slice thinly. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil over medium heat in heavy skillet. Add onions, garlic and potatoes. 
Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Uncover skillet, add vermouth and salt cod. Sprinkle with white pepper. Cook 
another 5 to 7 minutes until salt cod is opaque white and flaky. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove from heat and stir in sour cream. Transfer contents of skillet to 
serving platter. Sprinkle with parsley and serve immediately. Makes 4 servings. 
BRANDADE DE MORUE 1 1/2 pounds salt cod 1/2 pound potato 1/2 to 3/4 cup olive 
oil 2 tablespoons finely minced garlic Toast 
</P>
<P>
 Two days before preparing brandade, place salt cod in bowl, cover with water 
and place in refrigerator. Change water 3 to 4 times. Drain salt cod and 
discard water. 
</P>
<P>
 Rinse potato. Bake at 375 degrees 45 minutes or until potato is tender. Remove 
potato from oven, cut in half, scoop pulp into mixing bowl and discard or eat 
skin. 
</P>
<P>
 While potato is baking, place cod in medium pot. Cover with fresh cold water. 
Place over medium heat, bring to boil, remove from heat and let stand 10 
minutes. Drain fish and discard water. Remove and discard skin and bones. 
</P>
<P>
 Add cooked fish to mixing bowl. Mash with potato. Large wooden pestle works 
best. Potatoes and fish also can be placed in mixer fitted with paddle. Then 
mix until fluffy. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, combine oil and garlic in small saucepan over medium heat. Cook 
until oil begins to bubble around garlic, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. 
Slowly pour garlic oil into bowl, mixing vigorously until incorporated. Mixture 
should be fluffy and shiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Mound mixture onto serving platter and surround with toast. Serve crisp green 
salad along side brandade. Makes 4 servings. SALT COD BAKED WITH TOMATOES AND 
CHARD 1 1/2 pounds salt cod 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 pound green chard, center 
stem removed 2 large onions, thinly sliced 3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 1 
(1-pound) can whole peeled tomatoes, drained 1 bay leaf 1 sprig thyme 1 sprig 
rosemary 1 teaspoon ground white pepper 1/2 cup white wine 
</P>
<P>
 Two days before preparing brandade, place salt cod in bowl, cover with water 
and place in refrigerator. Change water 3 to 4 times. Drain salt cod and 
discard water. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil over medium heat in skillet, add chard and cook, turning, 2 minutes, 
until very tender. Transfer chard to 2-inch-deep oven-proof casserole or baking 
dish. 
</P>
<P>
 Distribute onions, garlic, tomatoes, bay leaf, thyme, rosemary, white pepper 
and salt cod on bed of chard. Moisten with wine. Bake, covered, at 350 degrees 
35 minutes. Makes 4 servings.

 CUP CONTENDERS: Months of hard work paid off this week when the soccer team 
from the African nation of Cameroon began preparing for the World Cup on newly 
laid fields at Oxnard College. . . . Decked out in green, gold and crimson, the 
Cameroonians have drawn hundreds of fans to their practices. They take on 
Ventura County all-stars tonight at 7 at Channel Islands High. . . . "Their 
practices are really supercharged and really something to take in," college 
spokeswoman Cathy Garnica said. 
</P>
<P>
 IN THE CLEAR: Prosecutors have cleared Simi Valley High baseball coach Mike 
Scyphers of criminal wrongdoing, stemming from accusations that he mishandled 
team money and discipline (C1). . . . Parents who have supported the coach all 
along said their children's baseball season was devastated. "I blame the school 
administration absolutely, in total, for ruining my son's senior year baseball 
experience," parent Maureen Celusta said. 
</P>
<P>
 PLAYING GAMES: It has come to this: even pool halls have gone upscale and 
become politically correct (Ventura County Life, Page 8). . . . Once near 
extinction, pool rooms have rebounded from the depths of disrepute by evolving 
into safe and wholesome places. Still, there remain some parlors that cling to 
their dark-and-dingy reputations. . . . "The new places have no character," 
says Mark Morales, whose gritty Santa Paula pool hall is the oldest in Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 QUAKE RELIEF: Former Laker basketball star A.C. Green will tour Fillmore and 
Piru on Monday to see how merchants are recovering from the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
. . . Green, who now plays for the Phoenix Suns, helped provide modular 
trailers for merchants displaced by the quake. Officials have been trying to 
get Green to visit for some time. . . . "Unfortunately, he has the time now to 
come out because his team is no longer playing," said Nancy Bocovich, a program 
assistant with the county. The Suns were eliminated from the NBA playoffs last 
month.

SCOTT HARRIS: A CONVERSE RESULT OF TERM LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There were no television cameras at this victory party. There was no speech, 
no cheering partisans. I can't recall a single balloon. There were cold cuts 
and Cokes and a dozen or so of the candidate's supporters watching returns on 
two TVs. There was also a storeroom loaded with an arsenal of campaign signs 
that were deemed unnecessary for the primary, but will soon be planted on lawns 
in Van Nuys, North Hollywood, Pacoima and elsewhere. They looked something like 
this: 
</P>
<P>
 Another Valley Voter for  
</P>
<P>
 Senator  
</P>
<P>
 ROSENTHAL  
</P>
<P>
 Democrat  
</P>
<P>
 Seven well-chosen words should be more than enough to assure that state Sen. 
Herschel Rosenthal will successfully complete his hop from his home district, 
rooted primarily in the Westside, to the 20th, entirely in the Valley. "Another 
Valley Voter . . ." mutes the charges of carpetbagger. "Senator" connotes 
experience and implies incumbency. "Democrat" speaks volumes in a district that 
is only 28% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 I had dropped by because I wanted to talk with Rosenthal, a 20-year veteran of 
the Legislature, about term limits. Fans of term limits say politicians like 
Rosenthal are the reason term limits are a fine idea -- to bring in new people, 
new ideas. People prefer the idea of "citizen-politicians" to the idea of 
"career politicians." I'm still not sold. Haven't voters always had the power 
to end a politician's career? 
</P>
<P>
 The odd thing is, term limits are extending Rosenthal's. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you ask Herschel Rosenthal why, at age 77, he is still running instead of 
retiring, you'll hear a lot of ifs. "If it wasn't for the earthquake" is one. 
"If Barbara Friedman had decided to run" is another. Another is the fact that 
reapportionment in 1990 bequeathed to Rosenthal, accustomed to his Westside, 
heavily Jewish base, a turf farther east with a 46% Latino population. And 
another is his failure to beat Tom Hayden in a 1992 race for the 23rd Senate 
District on the Westside -- the seat Rosenthal coveted as his solution to 
redistricting. 
</P>
<P>
 But of all the ifs, none is bigger than term limits. If not for that, state 
Sen. David Roberti would not have run, unsuccessfully, for treasurer. Roberti, 
having survived carpetbagging charges himself, would have run for reelection 
and retained his considerable power as Senate majority leader. Even Valleyites 
who don't care for Roberti may miss the way his clout might have aided Valley 
causes, from earthquake recovery to the crusade to dismantle the Los Angeles 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead it will be Rosenthal, serving one last term. Only months before he had 
announced his intention to retire and held a fund-raiser to cover campaign 
debts. 
</P>
<P>
 How did this happen? The official story is that, after Assemblywoman Barbara 
Friedman, busy with an adopted baby, opted against a run for the Senate in a 
overlapping district, the Democratic leadership turned to Rosenthal and 
encouraged him to run. Rosenthal, whose district has always included southern 
portions of the Valley, said he decided to switch districts only because of the 
Northridge earthquake and his fervent belief that the Valley needs an 
experienced hand to help with quake legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 To some political observers, this earthquake explanation seems almost quaint. 
Instead of a selfless public servant, they see a cog in a political machine 
that simply adapts and mutates to the new reality of term limits. They see a 
man who long ago was busy volunteering for other candidates before he was 
anointed by the political alliance headed by congressmen Henry Waxman and 
Howard Berman. They say Rosenthal won election in a safe district, and now 
simply doesn't want to let go of the privilege, prestige and perks. In the 
campaign against Hayden, he was criticized for accepting gifts and travel from 
special interests.  
</P>
<P>
 Michael Del Rio, the neophyte who was Rosenthal's only opposition in the 
primary, couldn't resist a chuckle when told that it was the earthquake that 
made Rosenthal run. Del Rio, an investment banker, received 25% of the vote -- 
"a respectable showing," he said, "for being a 27-year-old Hispanic from the 
Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Del Rio, unlike Rosenthal, is a fan of term limits. "Anytime somebody's in 
office for more than two terms," he says, "it becomes a boys' club . . . a 
boys' and girls' club. And really, everybody's in somebody's pocket." 
</P>
<P>
 But he speaks respectfully of Rosenthal, praising him as "one of the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Del Rio, who had filed for both the 20th Senate District and for Friedman's 
Assembly seat in case she pursued the upper house, intends to try again. 
"Basically this was a steppingstone for me to get name recognition," he 
explains. 
</P>
<P>
 And if Del Rio plans to run in '98, it would be nice to have the incumbent's 
support. Even better, it would be nice if Rosenthal encouraged him to run -- 
just as Waxman urged Rosenthal to run for his old Assembly seat back in '74.

EVANGELIST'S TAX CONVICTION CLEARS WAY FOR L.A. CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Evangelist Tony Alamo, whose religious empire included country and Western 
clothing boutiques, was convicted Wednesday in Memphis, Tenn., on federal tax 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict clears the way for Alamo to be returned to Los Angeles to stand 
trial on charges that he ordered the beating of a young boy at his Saugus 
commune in 1988. A hearing in that case has been scheduled for today in Los 
Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Alamo built his church from a small street ministry begun in California more 
than 20 years ago. Known for his diatribes against the Pope and the news media, 
Alamo also had churches and followers in Arkansas and Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal court jury convicted him Wednesday of falsifying his federal income 
tax return for 1985 and failing to file returns from 1986 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors deliberated 90 minutes on Monday and all day Tuesday and Wednesday 
before convicting Alamo on all counts. 
</P>
<P>
 Government prosecutors said Alamo used the tax-exempt Tony and Susan Alamo 
Christian Foundation and, later, the Music Square Church, to avoid paying 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The case wasn't about religion and Alamo can't find defense for his tax 
problems in the Bible, said Justice Department lawyer Christopher Belcher. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted in closing arguments that Christ was born when Joseph and Mary 
returned to Bethlehem to pay their taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "All Tony Alamo had to do was go to the mailbox and drop a return in the 
mail," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alamo's attorney, Jeffrey Dickstein, blamed Alamo's legal troubles on his 
ex-wives, overbearing government agencies and former church members, many of 
them former drug addicts. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Alamo's businesses operated at a loss and Alamo had no income himself. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Angeles case, Alamo is accused of directing four men via telephone 
from another location to punish the boy with 140 strokes of a large paddle. 
Alamo, who turned down a plea bargain offer that would have spared him from 
jail if he agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor child abuse charge, has 
denied any wrongdoing. He could face a possible six-year sentence.

CHANGES TO MEDICARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am writing to correct the inaccuracies in "Siphoning Medicare to Aid Health 
Plan Appears Risky" (May 2).  
</P>
<P>
 The authors are dead wrong about Medicare's cost-containment record.Since 
1986, while private insurance premiums have grown at a rate of over 9% per 
year, the Medicare program has kept its growth rate at 7.2%. At the same time, 
private insurance benefits have been cut back and Medicare benefits have been 
improved. There's no disputing that Medicare's cost-containment efforts have 
been more successful than private sector efforts.  
</P>
<P>
 The President's Health Security Act will achieve both public and private 
sector reductions in the rate of all health care spending. Without health care 
reform, additional isolated cuts in Medicare will jeopardize the program for 
beneficiaries and providers. Today, Medicare pays providers adequately and our 
beneficiaries receive good care. But as long as private sector health care 
costs grow at an unconstrained rate, private payments to providers will always 
grow faster than Medicare payments. 
</P>
<P>
 The Medicare savings under the Health Security Act are not diverted to finance 
universal coverage for the entire population; they pay for new benefits for the 
elderly and disabled. These savings primarily come from reductions in the 
growth rate of payments to providers.  
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's health reform plan provides for universal coverage; it 
improves and protects the Medicare program; and it achieves real cost 
containment that will help ensure the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund.

AGAIN, REST OF NATION FACES WESTWARD TO TEST POLITICAL WIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As usual, California seems to be incapable of holding an election that 
non-Californians don't notice. And Tuesday's was extremely noticeable. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly the White House had to notice it. It will note that Republican Gov. 
Pete Wilson fought off challenger Ron K. Unz, from the party's right wing, for 
the gubernatorial nomination. The thought of Wilson, battered by the economy, 
somehow winning a second term in November and emerging as a plausible GOP 
candidate for the presidency from electoral-vote-rich California has got to be 
scary for President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington -- reeling from the unflattering imagery of the recent indictment 
of then-House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski -- was 
watching for any anti-incumbent tide here. It looks as if the answer was mixed. 
Some familiar figures lost -- most notably state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van 
Nuys), who in an April recall survived an ambush by the gun lobby but was 
gunned down Tuesday for the state treasurer's job by better-financed Phil 
Angelides, a rising young star in the state Democratic Party. Tony Miller, the 
first openly gay candidate to run for statewide office, upset two familiar 
faces in the Democratic primary for secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
 But incumbents prevailed in the state's three congressional primaries singled 
out for national scrutiny. In Riverside, Republican incumbent Ken Calvert won 
his primary in spite of a sex scandal. In Ukiah, incumbent Democrat Dan Hamburg 
prevailed despite a strong challenge. In Diamond Bar, Republican Jay C. Kim -- 
the first Korean American to serve in Congress -- won his primary despite 
allegations of financial impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
 Political observers at large will also take note of the electorate's defeat of 
the four statewide bond measures. Once again, the state that gave birth to the 
tax revolt with Proposition 13 is sending out a warning signal about government 
spending. Alas, the measures defeated -- they carried Los Angeles County, but 
not the state -- represented, on the whole, needed infrastructure investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County voters showed their customary unwillingness to spend new money, 
which is understandable. But in one unfortunate instance, they even recalled 
City Council members who already had spent it in an effort to close a 
$3-million city budget deficit, which is sad. This happened in Fullerton, where 
the three council members who last July imposed a 2% utility tax in a 3-2 vote 
were dumped even though the utility tax was due to lapse next year -- and was 
needed to avoid cutting fire and police services. At the same time, local 
revenue-raising measures in Pasadena, Altadena and Hawthorne -- for libraries 
and schools -- did get voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
 But voters statewide rejected a bond measure to fund California's 10% share of 
the total Jan. 17 earthquake repair bill -- the deal with the federal 
government, which ponied up 90%. That was unfortunate -- but hardly surprising. 
We only reluctantly supported the bond measure when the Legislature failed to 
enact a temporary state sales tax hike to cover the state's matching-funds 
obligation. Now the Legislature has to go back to the drawing board and find 
financing of some kind. It would be nice to see -- though we're not holding our 
breath -- Kathleen Brown and other top Democrats announce support for whatever 
sensible measure might be agreed on -- to give Gov. Wilson the political cover 
needed to sign a temporary revenue measure without getting clobbered with it 
during the fall campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown especially should be sympathetic. Because although she won, handily, the 
right to be the Democratic nominee for governor, she like Pete Wilson looks to 
have a lot of convincing to do among the party faithful. In aggregate she got 
less than half the Democratic vote; in the governor's case a third of the 
Republican vote went to a total newcomer. So both candidates have internal 
party problems to overcome. It would be nice if certain issues, such as meeting 
our obligation for Washington's massive earthquake relief, could be kept on a 
high plane. Dream on. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course that won't be the only hot race this fall. Democratic Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein appears to be facing a serious challenge from Rep. Michael Huffington 
(R-Santa Barbara), who will run a well-financed campaign out of his own pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it will take a hot campaign or two to get out the vote in this state. On 
Tuesday Californians broke an unenviable record. In a year when South Africans 
stood in lines that wound for miles in order to exercise the privilege of 
voting, Californians stayed away from the polls in unprecedented numbers. 
Secretary of State-elect Tony Miller put voter turnout statewide at 32.9% of 
registered voters (which comes to less than one-fourth of eligible voters), far 
below the previous record low, 38.8% in 1990. The numbers were no better in Los 
Angeles County and worse in Orange County. But rather than merely bemoan the 
decline of an engaged democratic society, we all need to take a look at what 
feeds voter apathy and hope the passion meter will be higher come November. 
</P>
<P>
 But turnout cannot and should not depend on passion alone. When more 
Californians see a connection between what's going on in their often busy and 
stressed-out lives and what's on the ballot, they will return to the polling 
booths. Until then, one-fourth will continue to make the decisions for the 
other three-fourths, in a nation where that really shouldn't happen.

FOREIGN POLICY PROFILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A President whose tenure is likely to always be shadowed by his own avoidance 
of military service could have felt some awkwardness as he led ceremonies 
honoring those Americans who fought and died a half-century ago to help achieve 
Europe's liberation. But Bill Clinton met the occasion with a dignity that did 
credit to the moment and to his office.Everywhere, he spoke with feeling, grace 
and sometimes memorable eloquence. Like the veterans of the war against Nazism 
who returned to the battlefields of their youth, most Americans who followed 
the D-Day ceremonies surely were moved. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, in short, met the high expectations the American people have for 
their President on such occasions. But in a context where every word and step 
can be scripted and rehearsed -- and saying this in no way detracts from what 
he accomplished -- that is really the easy part of the job. The far greater 
task is to bring the same degree of sureness and competency to the day-to-day 
management of his office. 
</P>
<P>
 For any modern President, whether he likes it or not, foreign policy is half 
the job. It's no secret that after 17 months in office Clinton's approach to 
foreign policy still seems to lack context and direction; it lacks, in other 
words, clear leadership. Clinton's visit to one of World War II's climactic 
battlefields inevitably evokes memories of one of his great predecessors, 
Franklin D. Roosevelt, who also faced a formidable domestic agenda but who was 
compelled also to think and act globally. The global challenges haven't gone 
away. They still insistently demand and must have the President's urgent 
attention.

HAITI POOR IN EMBARGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Haiti Poor Get Poorer in Embargo" (May 23) needs to be absorbed by our 
politicians. How can we expect the people of Haiti and Iraq (against whom we 
also have an embargo) to rise up against their dictators when their countries 
are in chaos? People are too weak and sickly to do anything against their 
governments while those in government don't seem to be suffering any adverse 
effects.It seems to me that we are actually helping the dictators to stay in 
power. We say we allow food and medicine into the countries but the poor are 
not getting either because they have no money. 
</P>
<P>
 We are causing vast numbers of people to suffer miserably. We've got to find a 
more effective way to deal with these cruel regimes. Allowing babies and their 
parents to suffer and to die is surely not the American way.

ABORTION IN HEALTH PACKAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Kinsley's argument to keep abortion separate from health reform lacks 
the logical depth he normally shows (Column Left, May 26). He says anyone who 
thinks that abortion is murder can opt out if she wants to. But women always 
have that right; what pro-lifers want is to prevent other female citizens from 
exercising their own moral judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinsley also argues, unconvincingly, that moral objections to war differ from 
moral objections to taxes that subsidize abortion because war supposedly serves 
the general good. Abortion, like war, is an admittedly repugnant procedure 
deemed necessary by the cold realities of a crowded planet. Both of these 
procedures can be abused; neither should be taken lightly. But both can also 
serve the social good. A drug-addicted woman, for example, would be doing a 
greater kindness by terminating her pregnancy than by presenting society with a 
deformed, un-adoptable baby to support. Similarly, keeping the population down 
has social benefits for the entire planet. 
</P>
<P>
 The small number of the passionate partisans on either side is irrelevant to 
the concepts of equal justice and health care needs. Admittedly, 
right-to-lifers deserve the right to choose. But they should not impose their 
choice on others, especially not when they discriminate against poor women. 
</P>

 * I want to applaud Kinsley for revealing the hypocrisy of the "pro-choice" 
movement. Pro-lifers must not be forced to pay, through taxes, for the murder 
of the unborn. The pro-choice movement seeks not to promote "choice," but to 
extinguish all alternative options from which to "choose." 
</P>
<P>
 The rush to ensure that abortions are among the guaranteed benefits in 
President Clinton's health care package is another example of the deterioration 
of one of our basic rights. That is, the right against government interference 
into our moral principles. 
</P>
<P>
 Wake up, America! The choices in our "democracy" are dwindling fast.

 * Great article. I'm so glad Kinsley understands so intimately what it is like 
for a woman facing the choice of abortion. It is also wonderful that he has 
come to the conclusion that cost is not an issue when making this decision. As 
he stated, "Even a poor woman often can scrape together $250." Of course she 
could -- maybe by prostituting a few nights. Why not? She's already pregnant! 
If cost were not an issue, perhaps Kinsley ought to explain to me why poorer 
communities have more children than affluent communities. 
</P>
<P>
 I am left wondering if Kinsley believes women become pregnant all by 
themselves -- where is there any acknowledgment of male responsibility in all 
this?

 * Some people object to blood transfusions. Some people object to birth 
control. Some people object to genetic engineering. Is Kinsley proposing that 
we provide ourselves with medical coverage that looks like Swiss cheese, or are 
only pregnant women to be targeted?

ENFORCING CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your editorial "A Serving of Justice at Denny's" (May 27) was right on the 
mark concerning the need to vigorously enforce civil rights laws. No pun 
intended, but the lawyers in the Civil Rights Division at the Justice 
Department hit a "grand slam."  
</P>
<P>
 As important as the Denny's case may be from a legal perspective, there is a 
larger, unenforceable issue to be considered: the obligation we all have to be 
responsible citizens. Obligations imply a moral, not merely a legal, command. 
Criminal laws punish stealing, but not a lack of generosity. They penalize the 
man who uses his hand as a weapon, but not the man who fails to extend it in 
help. In the case of civil rights, the law can enforce their observance, but 
not their respect. 
</P>
<P>
 So the real lesson learned from the Denny's case is that 30 years after the 
passage of our most important civil rights laws discrimination still exists. 
Only when we accept the full equality and dignity of each individual can we 
fulfill the promise of America, and create an awareness of something that is 
higher and more sensitive than any requirement of the law. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * We applaud your story on the federal civil rights suit against Denny's 
restaurants ("Denny's Restaurants Settle Bias Suits for $54 Million," May 25). 
These suits are important because they do affect public perceptions and private 
behaviors, and redress is provided for individuals wronged. But it's not 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Your story says that Denny's will be required to "train its employees in 
racial sensitivity"; but is it the quick Band-Aid approach that's going to be 
acceptable to the court? We must strive harder to change American corporate 
culture to show the harmfulness and the wrongfulness of such discrimination -- 
and it's all the staff of these companies who must understand that it's harmful 
and wrong. Meaningful cross-cultural human relations training must be done in a 
serious and systematic way to be truly effective. 
</P>
<P>
 We must begin to see that a fight for fairness and equal opportunity/access 
must be waged in every workplace setting.

REP. ROSTENKOWSKI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to "Rostenkowski Faces 17 Counts," June 1: 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) has all the class and resourcefulness of an 
itinerant purse snatcher. With the entire multitrillion-dollar federal treasury 
at his disposal, he settles for grubbing a few measly bucks out of the House 
Post Office till.What kind of petty and uninspired example is this to set for 
the new members of his celestial profession? 
</P>
<P>
 Has the fellow no knowledge or appreciation of history? His ridiculous little 
misappropriation is an embarrassment and humiliation to his numerous political 
antecedents who labored so mightily to achieve the high standards of corruption 
and malfeasance required to bring us the spellbinding scandals of Tammany Hall 
and Teapot Dome, the impeachment-inspiring misdeeds of Watergate and the 
creative machinations of Iran-Contra, to name but a few of the more celebrated 
perversions of political trust. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be advisable for Rosty to retire, for he obviously does not have the 
right stuff, and his financial ambitions seem far too humble to excite the kind 
of PAC support that everyone of his calling needs to sustain himself in office. 
</P>

<P>
 * It has occurred to me that President Clinton can assist himself with the 
Congress and Rostenkowski's influence therein regarding health care legislation 
by using a well-tried, more-than-once-executed Republican President's maneuver: 
Grant a pardon! Former Presidents Ford, Reagan and Bush all did for their 
friends and cohorts! Just an idea. 
</P>
<P>

REALITY BITES CALIFORNIA'S BUDGET DEFICIT; STATE FINANCES: BONDS MUST BE LINKED 
TO SPENDING CUTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM CAMPBELL, Tom Campbell (R-Stanford) is a state senator. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state's budget is out of balance by more than $6 billion. The voters have 
turned down the earthquake-bond initiative, adding $2 billion to our shortfall. 
If we lose a pending lawsuit in the U.S. Supreme Court, the deficit will exceed 
$10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Constitution requires that borrowing of the size necessary to 
cover this deficit be approved by the voters. Smaller amounts of borrowing, 
reasonably related only to the cash-flow problems of state finance, can be 
handled by revenue-anticipation notes. In recent years, however, reliance on 
these notes has gone far beyond their legitimate purpose. To rely on them to 
finance a deficit of this size is contrary to our Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue-anticipation notes also carry higher interest rates than long-run 
debt. If we must borrow to finance our deficit, therefore, it would be more 
economical to borrow in the long-term market. That is particularly true if the 
Federal Reserve continues its present policy of raising rates in the short-term 
debt market, where revenue-anticipation notes must compete. 
</P>
<P>
 I agree with the governor that the federal government should fund our state's 
costs caused by immigration, both legal and illegal. We should keep maximum 
pressure on the federal government to comply with their obligation. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudence, however, requires planning for undesired alternatives. This budget 
makes no such contingency plans. It was based on assumptions that California 
would receive federal immigration assistance, win the pending Barclays 
litigation (multistate and foreign corporations are challenging California's 
unitary tax; $2.7 billion is at stake) and pass the earthquake bonds. The bond 
measure is gone, and the President and Congress have shown reluctance to 
provide the immigration funding. The total from all three assumptions is 
almost$8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 This failure to provide for adverse contingencies will hurt California's 
credibility in the debt markets when it eventually becomes necessary to borrow 
again. Even more important, it is untrue to our state constitutional obligation 
to make the difficult decisions to balance our budget or ask the people for 
permission not to do so through more long-term bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eventual compromise, there will be those calling for cuts in spending, 
increases in sales or gasoline taxes and more bonds. The bonds should be 
coupled with spending cuts and presented as an alternative to tax increases. 
Tuesday's bonds weren't; they were seen as additional spending, and that's what 
the people rejected.  
</P>
<P>
 California's economic crisis was not created in a day. It is a result of 
massive cuts in federal defense spending, the collapse of our nation's 
financial institutions and the resulting glut of commercial and residential 
property. We Californians will work our way out of these difficulties. The rest 
of the country is recuperating, and we are the best-positioned state to take 
advantage of the North American Free Trade Agreement by selling in Mexico. But 
these positive trends will take some time to offset the negative trends that 
brought us to where we are. 
</P>
<P>
 If we make a case to the long-term lending community that our state's economic 
recovery is certain if not imminent, if we continue to show an actual decrease 
in the amount of state spending -- as we have each of the last three years 
under Gov. Pete Wilson -- the lending community will extend the credit to 
California to make the transition we need. It will not do to increase spending 
and go to the lending institutions; that's what New York City tried in the 
1970s with disastrous results. But if we present a budget with actual spending 
cuts below current levels, we will present a credible case for long-term debt. 
</P>
<P>
 We should present the same case to the voters of California, because it is 
only they who can say yes to such a plan. I believe they and the lending 
institutions will say yes, if we present in our budget a sincere attempt to 
provide for the undesirable contingencies and continue to cut spending. If our 
budget only assumes the happy outcome of these contingencies, we risk losing 
the confidence of the electorate and of the institutions whose financial 
assistance we'll need.

COUSCOUS: SALAD STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN RAICHLEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most of us can recall a budget food that sustained us during our penurious 
student days. For me, that food was couscous. I was studying in Paris, but the 
glories of French gastronomy were beyond my modest budget. I nourished my body 
and soul at that city's numerous Tunisian and Algerian restaurants, where a 
small sum would purchase mountains of this North African staple. 
</P>
<P>
 Couscous is often, but incorrectly, described as a grain. Actually, it's a 
type of pasta made from a dough that contains durum wheat (semolina) and water. 
Instead of being rolled out or extruded to form noodles, the dough is rubbed 
through a sieve to make tiny pellets. Moroccan cooking expert Paula Wolfert 
believes the word "couscous" is onomatopaeic for the sound of the pellets 
hitting the water. 
</P>
<P>
 But couscous also refers to a North African style of eating. The couscous (the 
pasta) arrives in a steaming mound on a platter. A spicy stew is ladled over 
the couscous, followed by a spoonful of harissa (fiery hot sauce). Often, for 
extra flavor, the couscous is steamed right over the stew. Like pasta, couscous 
can accommodate an almost endless variety of toppings and sauces. Its 
versatility has endeared it not only to North African cooks but to American 
chefs as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Couscous is a staple throughout North Africa where, according to Wolfert, it 
has been eaten since Roman times. Moroccan couscous is the mildest, lightest 
and fluffiest, while Algerian couscous is firm and dense. Couscous also turns 
up in Sicily, where it is served with seafood, and in Tunisia, where one 
version calls for pomegranates and orange flower water and is served as a 
dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional method of cooking couscous is to sprinkle it with milk and 
water, air-dry it (raking it with your fingers as it dries), then cook it in a 
steamer. The procedure is repeated three or four times; in the process, the 
individual couscous grains swell to seven or eight times their original size. 
This, the traditional Moroccan method, produces couscous of uncommon and 
ethereal lightness. For a complete account of this method, see Wolfert's book, 
"Couscous and Other Foods From Morocco." 
</P>
<P>
 Algerian restaurants in Paris use a slightly different method: The grains are 
rubbed with oil, rinsed with water and steamed only twice, with liberal 
buttering between steamings. The resulting couscous is harder and more compact; 
you can taste each individual grain when you take a bite. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, most of the couscous sold in the United States is quick-cooking 
couscous. To prepare couscous, saute 1/2 cup chopped onion and a few 
tablespoons each of pine nuts and currants in 1 tablespoon of butter or olive 
oil in a heavy saucepan over medium heat until tender, but not brown. Stir in 
one cup of couscous and toast for one minute. Add 1 1/2 cups or chicken or 
vegetable stock or water and season to taste with salt and pepper. Bring the 
mixture to a boil. Remove the pan from the heat, tightly covered, and let the 
couscous stand five minutes. Just before serving, fluff the couscous with a 
fork. For extra richness, add one tablespoon of butter before fluffing. This 
quick-cooking process produces a slightly heavier couscous than the traditional 
North African methods, but you can't beat the convenience. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It used to be that couscous could be found only in Middle Eastern markets. 
Today, it's sold boxed in virtually all natural food stores and gourmet shops, 
and even in the grain section of most supermarkets. Here is a recipe for 
enjoying this healthful grain-like pasta. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This dish makes a great salad for picnics. (Unlike green salads, it won't wilt 
. ) The flavorings are characteristic of Morocco, but the salad is purely 
American.

NBA FINALS; ROCKETS, RESTED BUT RUSTY, WIN, 85-78; GAME 1: HOUSTON SCORES ONLY 
13 POINTS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, BUT KNICKS FAIL TO TAKE ADVANTAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Son of Choke City, the next generation of indignities for the Houston Rockets, 
was coming fast Wednesday night at the Summit when who should ride in to save 
the day for the Houston Rockets but. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 No one. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets were ripe for another embarrassing moment, such as when they blew 
a 20-point lead to Phoenix earlier in the playoffs and got jumped by the 
headline writers, but again lived to tell. 
</P>
<P>
 They ran out of fuel, ran low on superstars and ran out of offense but did not 
run out of time, finding enough to recover and beat the New York Knicks, 85-78, 
in Game 1 of the NBA finals at the Summit. 
</P>
<P>
 The guy who usually comes in with the white hat, Hakeem Olajuwon? He made his 
last field goal with 7:25 left in the third quarter, missed his final seven 
shots and went zero for four in the fourth quarter. He scored 28 points, but 19 
of those came in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the team? They clocked out early, too, scoring 13 points in the 
fourth quarter while going two of 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Coach Rudy Tomjanovich, probably joking: "We made that many?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets' biggest advantage in their first appearance in the championship 
series since 1986 was that they played the Knicks, who will never be confused 
with a team that can spell the word "offense." 
</P>
<P>
 Given the opportunity to make up a 12-point deficit in the fourth quarter and 
steal a victory on the road, they exploded for 15 points in those dreadful 
final 12 minutes on six-of-24 shooting, making it the lowest-scoring quarter in 
a championship series in league history. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the kind of game that we wanted in the second half," Knick Coach Pat 
Riley said. "I thought we definitely began to wear a little bit on them. We 
made some adjustments that helped us. But when you get this far and work this 
hard, you've got to make some shots." 
</P>
<P>
 To think everyone wondered beforehand whether the Knicks would be exhausted 
because they were playing on the heels of two consecutive seven-game series, 
with only two days of to rest since beating Indiana on Sunday night in New New 
York. They seemed fine, conditioning wise, but it was the Rockets, they of the 
eight-day R & R since winning the West, who hit the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston was up, 77-65, with 8:53 left and seemingly coasting. But they didn't 
score again until 5:19 remained, and then it was on a pair of free throws. The 
Knicks started to reel them in, and the crowd grew antsy. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time John Starks made one free throw with 2:13 left -- what became an 
afterthought as he missed 15 of 18 attempts from the field -- the Rocket lead 
was down to 79-76. Houston kept missing, but the Knicks couldn't take 
advantage. Their next two possessions ended with Starks' three-point airball 
and Greg Anthony's pass that flew out of bounds 20 feet from the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, with 1:03 to go, the Rockets got another basket, a slam dunk from 
Otis Thorpe, part of his 14 points and 16 rebounds. That was worth an 82-76 
cushion, which held up. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a sense of relief to get the first game out of the way," Thorpe 
said. "We have a lot of confidence in our defense. We don't care if we score in 
the 70s or get into the 100s. We have confidence just the same." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Olajuwon: "Sitting down a week, we were pretty rusty. I'm just so happy 
we won. Sitting all week, practicing and waiting, was very difficult. Our 
timing is so different. . . . I was struggling the whole game to get into the 
flow." 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon finished 10 of 22 from the field but was nine of 13 in the first 
half. His counterpart in the much-anticipated matchup, Patrick Ewing, had 23 
points on 10-of-26 shooting and nine rebounds and had the advantage on defense 
of not having to worry full time about Olajuwon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks attacked him by committee. Ewing, Charles Oakley, Anthony Mason and 
Charles Smith all got shots at the regular-season most valuable player, but 
could only hope they had a hand in wearing him down as much as the layoff did. 
Olajuwon was successful until he wore down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was important to us that he just stuck in there," Thorpe said. "His shot 
wasn't falling, a couple people's shots weren't falling. I missed some inside. 
But at the same time, we hung in there. We hit some big free throws at the 
end."

FALLEN ANGELS RISE TO OCCASION; BASEBALL: JACKSON AND OWEN COME TO LIFE WITH 
EARLY HOME RUNS TO HELP LANGSTON AND ANGELS TO 5-4 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It is perhaps the most cruel and painful transition of an athlete's life. 
</P>
<P>
 One day you're a star, the focus of media and fan attention, knowing that your 
teammates rely on your talent. The next thing you know you're on the bench, 
willing to give anything just for another opportunity to prove you can still 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 No one will ever confuse Angel teammates Bo Jackson and Spike Owen, but on 
Wednesday afternoon in the Angels' 5-4 victory over the Minnesota Twins at 
Anaheim Stadium, they felt as if they never had more in common. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson and Owen each hit first-inning home runs that not only helped provide 
Mark Langston (3-4) his first victory in five starts, but showed the baseball 
world that it might be foolish to give up on either of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "People can say what they want about me," said Jackson, who in 107 at-bats has 
seven homers with 28 runs batted in, "but I speak with my actions. You look at 
my numbers, and look around the league at guys who play every day, and I've got 
nothing to be ashamed about." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, one of the world's most famous athletes, realizes that he no longer 
will play every day. Rookie Jim Edmonds has the starting left-field job. 
Jackson will be used only in spot starts against left-handers and pinch-hitting 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Is he complaining? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've accepted not playing every day," Jackson said. "If that's what (Manager 
Marcel Lachemann) wants to do, that's fine. Besides, I'm getting old, I can't 
be running out there every day." 
</P>
<P>
 This could be the final year of Jackson's career, but Owen suddenly is 
resurrecting his. The final year of his three-year, $7-million contract expires 
after the 1995 season, but if this keeps up, Owen says he may want to play 
another five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Owen, thrust into the starting third-base job when Damion Easley went on the 
disabled list, continued to show why the New York Yankees paid him that much 
money in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Owen became the first Angel in two years to lead off a game with a homer, and 
Jackson compounded Twin starter Jim Deshaies' misery by hitting a two-run homer 
that ended the scoring in the first inning. Owen continued to punish Deshaies 
in the second inning, hitting a two-run double to left field. 
</P>
<P>
 Owen, who never had played third base before this season, has become a savior 
since Easley's injury. He has started the last eight games at third base and 
has been stellar. He has hit safely in the last 10 games, batting .382 with two 
doubles, one triple and one homer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what's going to happen to me when people start getting healthy," 
said Owen, "but I'm trying to make a case for myself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I'm one of the older guys on a young team, but I'm showing people I 
can still play this game." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Langston: "Spike's been unbelievable. It's been difficult for him to go 
from being an everyday player to sitting on the bench. But look at him, he's 
the ultimate leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "The same goes for Bo. You don't see him going around moping about not 
playing. He may not have the range he had before the hip injury, but he proved 
today he can still play." 
</P>
<P>
 The early lead provided by Owen and Jackson proved to be the perfect cure-all 
for Langston and the Angels (25-34). Langston, who had not lasted longer than 
six innings in his five previous starts since returning from his April 12 elbow 
surgery, yielded four hits and two runs, striking out seven in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
 The mystery behind Langston's woes, he said, was hidden behind his closet 
door. He was rummaging through his closet Tuesday, noticed a few game films 
from his days in Seattle and sat down for a viewing session. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides being amazed at how young he looked six years ago, he was astonished 
at his discovery. He challenged hitters back in those days. Now, he suddenly 
realized, he had lost his aggressiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 This day, instead of nibbling at the corners, he came right at the Twins. He 
threw sliders that had them buckling at the knees. Curveballs were snapping 
over the plate. Fastballs were whizzing past. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked like he had the stuff to throw a no-hitter," Twin second baseman 
Chuck Knoblauch said. "He supposedly has a sore arm. I'd hate to see him 100% 
healthy."

EWING-OLAJUWON: MATCHUP FOR AGES; GAME 1: TEN YEARS AGO, THESE PLAYERS WERE AT 
CENTER STAGE IN THE NCAA BASKETBALL FINAL IN SEATTLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They have met before, this Patrick Ewing and this Hakeem Olajuwon. Also, 
Jupiter aligned with Mars and King Kong met Godzilla. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be like the Rockies against the Alps," predicted Don Donoher, coach of 
Dayton University, a victim. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't specify which was which; we do know the Lord alps those who alp 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would pay for a ticket to see Akeem against Ewing, if I could get one," 
said Anthony Teachey of Wake Forest, another victim. 
</P>
<P>
 That was back before Olajuwon decided to spell his name with an H, which meant 
heck for people who publish record books as well as to anyone assigned to play 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in the spring of 1984 that Olajuwon and Ewing met at the summit for the 
first and only other time. It was the NCAA final at the Kingdome in Seattle. It 
was anticipated with sucked-in breath, 7-footer against 7-footer much as it is 
for the NBA finals beginning Wednesday night at the Summit with a capital S. 
</P>
<P>
 Two big big men. You can hear the earth shudder under their footsteps. College 
basketball hadn't had a confrontation of post men like them since George Mikan 
and Bob Kurland in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 And what do Olajuwon and Ewing remember of their first confrontation? 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember that we lost," Olajuwon said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just the fact that we won it," Ewing said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a typical response from either or both. Actually, the event was more 
than that, especially in anticipation. Olajuwon was the big man from Nigeria 
who'd played handball and soccer and never had sneakers big enough until he 
came to the University of Houston. As a sophomore the thought of ice cream made 
him laugh. Ewing came from the island of Jamaica in time to play basketball in 
high school before going on to Georgetown. He was more polished, doing more 
things reflexively than Olajuwon, whose raw athletic talent simply glowed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He couldn't have been too raw, because he was the first pick," Ewing 
recalled. That was in 1984. Ewing was the first pick the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Their meeting had background. Olajuwon had been an object of some ridicule as 
a freshman, he knew so little basketball. By the time he was finished at 
Houston, he had been to the title game twice and the semifinals once. And lost 
all three. He has not yet won a championship anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing played in the NCAA championship game three times and won once. It is his 
only championship. "He has made us acutely aware of that," Knicks General 
Manager Dave Checketts notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgetown beat Houston, 85-74. The great man-against-man that was expected 
turned out, as if often does, less than expected. The giants largely canceled 
each other. The stars of the game were Georgetown freshmen Michael Graham, 
whose glare could have made small children cry, and Reggie Williams, who was 
named the MVP. 
</P>
<P>
 In the post-game television interviews, neither could speak a complete 
sentence. And Olajuwon wept. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember that Olajuwon was under the basket thunderstruck the year before when 
Lorenzo Charles made his last-instant dunk for North Carolina State to beat 
Houston. The year before that, Michael Jordan had stolen a pass with seconds to 
play as North Carolina beat Georgetown for the title. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing was a leadership figure for Georgetown, as much as John Thompson would 
permit any player to be a leadership figure. In an early round, Georgetown was 
on the brink, and Thompson went to Ewing at halftime and said, "Hey, let's stay 
in (the tournament) a while. Take over the game." 
</P>
<P>
 And Ewing took the expression for his own. During the game and subsequent 
games, he would say, "I don't want to go home yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The morning of the game, Ewing asked Thompson how he was feeling. Thompson 
said he felt terrible. "He told me not to feel terrible because we were going 
to be national champions," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 If anyone wants to see a parallel between that and what Ewing has been saying 
to the Knicks, go right ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing was such a dominating college player. "It's frightening," said Roosevelt 
Chapman of Dayton. "He's like an octopus; hands all over." 
</P>
<P>
 In the final, if there was a key moment in their struggle, it was at 16-16. 
Olajuwon rebounded and had the ball 3 feet from the basket. He faked; Ewing 
never moved. He went up and Ewing went with him. The little shot rolled off the 
rim. It was the last time Houston had a tie. Ewing had shown himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon still didn't know what to show. In the semifinal overtime victory, 
Houston was killing the clock and Olajuwon took two ill-advised shots. "There 
are probably 25,000 other American players who would have known to throw the 
ball out," Houston Coach Guy Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final, Olajuwon made six of nine shots for 15 points and had nine 
rebounds. Ewing made 4 of 8 for 10 points and had nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're both 31 now," Ewing said. "Older, wiser and smarter." 
</P>
<P>
 Both of them appear to be full of the thought of each other. "If you win a 
championship," Olajuwon said, "you truly win a championship."

WORRELL TWISTS; LASORDA SHOUTS; BASEBALL: RELIEVER IGNORES MANAGER'S MESSAGE TO 
HOLD RUNNER AND BLOWS TWO-RUN LEAD IN 5-4 LOSS TO MARLINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When it was over, and Manager Tom Lasorda had finished screaming in the 
clubhouse, and Todd Worrell had finished explaining how he blew Pedro Astacio's 
game, it all came down to this: Not only do the Dodgers have a closer who can't 
close, but he's not comfortable holding runners on and pitching at the same 
time. Even when it's the potential tying run. 
</P>
<P>
 Worrell, a day after once again being pronounced the official closer, blew his 
fourth consecutive save opportunity Wednesday night, surrendering a two-run, 
ninth-inning lead against the Florida Marlins and losing, 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marlins, who have delighted in the Dodger bullpen, drew two walks, had two 
hits and scored three runs off a combination of Astacio, Worrell and Al Osuna 
to take the series, 2-1, at Joe Robbie Stadium, sending the downcast Dodgers on 
to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just sick," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda, trying to win with a bullpen that has blown 15 of 24 save 
opportunities, even had Tom Candiotti warming up during the game. But he got 
sicker when he learned that Worrell had ignored a message from the bench to 
hold the potential tying run on at first base because he wanted to concentrate 
on the hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said what? " Lasorda asked with incredulity. 
</P>
<P>
 With one out, Kurt Abbott on third base and Chuck Carr -- who led the league 
with 58 stolen bases last season -- on first, Lasorda sent out a message to 
Worrell to use the 'slide step' in his delivery, and hold Carr on. But Worrell 
had other plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just going to concentrate on getting the hitter," Worrell said. "When 
I try to hurry up and pitch, especially the way things are going right now, I 
don't have as good stuff on my pitches. That's why we didn't make an effort on 
Carr. We decided to concentrate and get a good pitch on the hitter." 
</P>
<P>
 With pinch-hitter Jesus Tavares -- who is becoming the Marlins' version of 
former Atlanta Brave Francisco Cabrera -- at the plate, Carr stole second base 
easily. Actually, he could have walked to it. Mike Piazza didn't even make a 
throw, and that's good, because no one covered the bag. Only first baseman Eric 
Karros was trying to hold Carr on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, it's an important run, but you're trying to ask (Worrell) to do 
something he's not used to doing," Piazza said. "It was pretty much a mutual 
decision. . . . I told Joey (third base coach Joe Amalfitano) that if we 
weren't going to hold him on, I wasn't going to throw and take the chance of 
the ball going into center field." 
</P>
<P>
 Tavares hit a line drive to left field and Cory Snyder, trying to catch the 
ball on the fly to end the game, couldn't get to it. The ball short-hopped him 
and he ran past it. By then, Abbott and Carr had scored to tie the game and 
Tavares was on second. Osuna came in, and pinch-hitter Mario Diaz hit a line 
drive to center. Brett Butler, who took the game off, had just replaced Raul 
Mondesi in center field. Butler fielded the ball on the hop but his throw to 
the plate was high. Diaz scored, and Lasorda went screaming into the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda, after hearing a reporter recount Worrell's explanation for ignoring 
Carr, couldn't believe it. "OK," Lasorda said sarcastically, "that's good to 
know. So the guy that got that base hit off Worrell hit his good stuff?" 
</P>
<P>
 Astacio said he understood why he was taken out in the ninth inning after 
walking leadoff batter Kurt Abbott. An early 4-1 Dodger lead helped Astacio 
pitch the best he has in three starts, but it would all be for naught when he 
turned the ball over to Worrell, who has struggled badly since returning from 
the disabled list two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just keep pitching, that's about the only thing you can do to try and work 
out of it," said Worrell, who has converted only two of seven save 
opportunities. "The answer isn't to take time off." 
</P>
<P>
 Worrell was patient with reporters after the game, but Lasorda is clearly 
running out of patience with him. When asked if Worrell would get the ball 
again in a closer situation, he said: "In the words of the great Winston 
Churchill, we will cross that bridge when we come to it."

 "One year, the El Salavador captain approached Britain's Sir Alf Ramsey and

COLLEGE BASEBALL WORLD SERIES; GEORGIA TECH ELIMINATES CS FULLERTON, 3-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Georgia Tech is going to the championship game of the College World Series; 
Cal State Fullerton is returning home. 
</P>
<P>
 Nomar Garciaparra's leadoff homer in the top of the 12th inning Wednesday 
night gave the Yellow Jackets a 3-2 victory over the Titans. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Tech (50-16), seeded second in its first appearance at the series, 
will play the survivor of Bracket 2, in which Oklahoma (48-17) meets Arizona 
State (45-17) today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sooners will advance to the title game with a victory, while an Arizona 
State victory would force a second semifinal game between the teams on Friday. 
The championship game is Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Tech Coach Danny Hall, in his first national championship game as a 
player or a coach, said the game was the most exciting he had been in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was frustrating from my end and, again, it was a case that (starting 
pitcher) Brad Rigby kept us in the ballgame," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton, seeded seventh, ends the year at 47-16 after a game in which the 
Titans were 0 for 13 with runners in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
 "We left somewhere between 12 and 14 on base (actually 15, and) the most 
noticeable one was in the last inning," Titan Coach Augie Garrido said. "It was 
a devastating defeat." 
</P>
<P>
 Garciaparra's homer, his 15th of the year and first of the series, came 
against Titan reliever Ted Silva (4-4). It made a winner of Chris Myers (6-3), 
who gave up four hits and struck out six in four innings of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Garciaparra said Georgia Tech coaches gave him the green light to swing on a 
2-0 pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really looking for a good pitch to hit," he said. "I had to make sure I 
had a good pitch. I looked down at the coach and he said one spot, and he 
(Silva) happened to throw it there." 
</P>
<P>
 Silva said the pitch was a fastball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to challenge him," Silva said. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers' victory didn't come without a scare. Dante Powell singled to right with 
none out in the bottom of the 12th and advanced to third on Matt Saier's error. 
</P>
<P>
 Catcher Bret Hemphill walked, Sal Mancuso struck out, and D.C. Olsen popped 
up. Myers then walked pinch-hitter Jim Betzsold to load the bases before 
getting Brian King to fly out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're normally very good at converting those kinds of opportunities." Garrido 
said. "But that's also to the credit of the Georgia Tech pitching and defense."

 Georgia Tech struck early on Jay Payton's two-run homer with two out in the 
first inning. It was Payton's 20th of the year.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; SABERHAGEN SHOWS ARTISTRY; ROCKIES SHOW BATS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bret Saberhagen kept throwing hard and inside, sawing off the wood in Colorado 
batters' hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a lot of firewood for my fireplace this winter, but not much else to 
show for it," he said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because, despite being jammed and breaking their bats, Dante Bichette 
and Joe Girardi got enough wood on the ball for run-scoring singles in the 
eighth inning to rally the Rockies past the New York Mets, 5-4, at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Girardi, who had lined out to Saberhagen on his first at-bat and was called 
out on strikes on his next two appearances, got the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "He pretty much abused me the whole day, and he abused me on the last at-bat, 
too," Girardi said. "The two previous times he got two strikes on me and I had 
no chance. This time, I was trying to hit the first pitch I could hit. He threw 
me a fastball inside and jammed me. It was basically a lucky hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got five runs off a guy who's got as good a stuff as anybody in the 
league. They weren't five pretty runs, but they were winners." 
</P>
<P>
 Saberhagen (6-3) overcame an early 3-0 deficit and nursed a 4-3 lead into the 
eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put a lot of pitches where I wanted," said Saberhagen, who struck out seven 
and extended his streak without a walk to a club-record 41 innings. "They had 
four hits off broken bats, and four or five were jam shots. That hurt me." 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 5, San Diego 2 -- Terry Pendleton, fighting one of the worst slumps of 
his career, had three hits and three RBIs as Tom Glavine and the Braves won at 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the Braves' eighth in nine games and improved their record to 
20-2 against the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
 Glavine (7-5) allowed a run and six hits and struck out seven before leaving 
for a pinch-hitter after seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 8, Cincinnati 2 -- Terry McGriff drove in three runs and Allen 
Watson won his second consecutive start as the Cardinals used a 14-hit attack 
to win at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 McGriff, a reserve catcher, had a two-run double off John Smiley (4-8) in the 
second inning and an RBI groundout in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson (4-3) left with a blister on the middle finger of his pitching hand in 
the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Smiley has lost his last six decisions, going winless since May 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 9, Montreal 2 -- Jeff Bagwell hit two home runs and pitcher Brian 
Williams went two for four and drove in the deciding runs as the Astros won at 
Montreal to snap the Expos' six-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams (3-2) broke a 2-2 tie in the sixth inning with a two-out, two-run 
single to left field on an 0-and-2 pitch from Jeff Fassero. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagwell's home runs, a three-run shot off reliever Brian Looney in the seventh 
inning and a solo homer off Fassero (4-4) in the fourth, were his 14th and 15th 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 3, Chicago 0 -- David West pitched seven strong innings at 
Philadelphia and the Phillies sent the Cubs to their ninth loss in a row, 
longest losing streak for Chicago in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 West (2-5) allowed three hits, struck out five and walked two, and allowed 
only two runners to reach second base. It was his fourth start of the season 
after joining the rotation because of injuries to other starters. 
</P>
<P>
 Heathcliff Slocumb pitched the eighth inning for the Phillies and Doug Jones 
worked the ninth for his 16th save. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 3, San Francisco 1 -- Denny Neagle pitched his first complete game 
in 124 major league appearances, shutting down the Giants on four hits at 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Van Slyke, back in the lineup after a slump-induced two-game benching, 
tripled in a run as the Pirates beat the Giants for the first time in six 
tries. 
</P>
<P>
 Neagle (6-6), making his 28th start in the majors and 12th of the season, 
never allowed more than one runner in any inning.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; TIGERS HAVE A WEEK IN ONE INNING

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gar Finnvold, still looking for his first major league victory, found out in 
the fourth inning he wouldn't get it Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He had pitched 3 1/3 innings and given up four runs for the Boston Red Sox. 
And that was as good as it got. Actually, Finnvold was lucky he got out early. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers sent 14 batters to the plate in the fifth inning and scored 10 runs 
in beating Boston, 14-5, at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Frohwirth allowed six runs on three hits in two-thirds of an inning in 
relief of Finnvold and reliever Greg Harris surrendered four runs on five hits 
in 2 2/3. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, if a guy in the bullpen is struggling, another guy will pick him 
up," Frohwirth said. "That hasn't been the case the last 10 days. The bullpen 
is getting a lot of work, but no one is getting the job done. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen anything like this before." 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth inning was a nightmare for Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Cecil Fielder singled and moved to second when first baseman Mo Vaughn 
misplayed Kirk Gibson's grounder. After Mickey Tettleton flied out, Junior 
Felix walked, loading the bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Gomez doubled in Fielder and Gibson. Chad Kreuter singled in Felix and 
Gomez and Tony Phillips walked. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris relieved Frohwirth and Lou Whitaker doubled in Kreuter and Phillips. 
Travis Fryman singled and Fielder singled home Whitaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson doubled in Fryman before Tettleton popped out. Felix doubled in the 
final two runs of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 3, Toronto 2 -- Mike LaValliere singled home the winning run in the 
bottom of the ninth inning as the White Sox rallied to win at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 With the White Sox trailing, 2-1, Julio Franco opened the inning with a single 
off reliever Darren Hall. Pinch-runner Joey Cora took third base on a single by 
Robin Ventura and scored on Darren Jackson's single to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
 Lance Johnson struck out before LaValliere singled up the middle, scoring 
Ventura with the winning run. Hall (1-2) allowed four hits in one-third of an 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 6, New York 5 -- Dean Palmer doubled in two runs and scored the other in 
a three-run sixth inning at Arlington, Tex., that led the Rangers to their 
fourth victory in five games. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Oliver relieved for Texas with the bases loaded and none out in the 
ninth inning with a 6-4 lead. He got Gerald Williams to ground into a 
run-scoring double play on the first pitch, then retired Bob Melvin on a foul 
pop for his first major league save. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Smith (1-0), called up Monday night, earned his first major league victory 
by pitching 1 2/3 scoreless innings. He relieved Bruce Hurst in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 6, Kansas City 4 -- Cal Ripken Jr. homered for the second game in a 
row and later ignited a three-run seventh inning that carried the Orioles to a 
victory at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripken hit his sixth homer in the third inning, giving the Orioles a 3-1 lead. 
Mike Macfarlane's RBI triple helped give the Royals a 4-3 lead in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripken's two-out single sent Mark McLemore to third base in the seventh 
inning, from which Rafael Palmeiro knocked him in to tie the score, 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Baines and Leo Gomez also had run-scoring hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 6, Oakland 1 -- Dave Nilsson doubled home the go-ahead run and John 
Jaha and Matt Mieske hit consecutive two-run doubles as the Brewers broke loose 
in the eighth inning to win at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 The score was tied, 1-1, when Bill Spiers led off the eighth with a single 
against A's reliever Vince Horsman (0-1). After B.J. Surhoff sacrificed, Mark 
Acre relieved and walked Greg Vaughn. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiers scored when Nilsson doubled to left. Brian Harper was then 
intentionally walked to load the bases, and Jaha doubled into the left-field 
corner. Mieske followed with a double to right-center. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 5, Seattle 3 -- Albert Belle and rookie Manny Ramirez hit home runs 
as the Indians broke a nine-game losing streak at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Clark (7-1) won his fifth consecutive decision.

NEWSWIRE: CHIEFS RELEASE LOWERY BUT HOPE TO RE-SIGN KICKER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The most accurate kicker in NFL history is out of work. 
</P>
<P>
 In a salary-cap move, the Kansas City Chiefs released Nick Lowery on 
Wednesday, hoping to re-sign him for lower pay as a free agent. Lowery, 38, 
will be asked to take a cut from his scheduled base salary of $675,000. Bonuses 
and incentive clauses could have raised the figure to $771,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowery said last month that if he were cut, he would be curious about his 
market value. Kicker Pete Stoyanovich signed a $4.25-million contract with the 
Miami Dolphins in February. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs had approached Lowery about taking a pay cut last April, but he 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City has signed free-agent kicker Lin Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowery was 23 for 29 last season. Four of the misses were from farther than 40 
yards and one was blocked. He is 329 for 411 in his career, the NFL leader at 
80%.

 Unless an agreement is reached soon, All-Pro cornerback Deion Sanders will not 
play for the Atlanta Falcons next season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons are offering Sanders, who also plays baseball and was recently 
traded by the Atlanta Braves to the Cincinnati Reds, a one-year contract for 
$2.88 million, pro-rated according to the number of games he plays. Sanders is 
demanding a three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
 If Sanders rejects the latest overtures, the Falcons are expected to sign 
linebacker Clay Matthews, an unrestricted free agent formerly with the 
Cleveland Browns. Falcon Coach June Jones said the team could not afford to 
sign both.

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: CAIN HOPES TO LASSO A VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steer roping and bull riding seem like a strange background for Jet Ski 
racing, but it has been a natural transition for Jerry Cain of Newhall, a 
one-time rodeo champion who is now campaigning on the Budweiser Jet Sports Tour 
as a Sea-Doo rider. 
</P>
<P>
 "Balance is so important in team roping and riding bulls, and I found out last 
year when I tried racing Jet Skis that balance was just as important in riding 
one of them, too," Cain said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also found he could get more speed by pressing down on his heels while 
bouncing across the water, a maneuver similar to one he used 20 years ago when 
he pushed his heels in the stirrups while riding horses on the Professional 
Rodeo Cowboys Assn. circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Cain, 37, is one of more than 250 touring professionals and amateurs who will 
compete this weekend in the Westcoast Performance Nationals on Puddingstone 
Lake at Bonelli Regional County Park near San Dimas. It is the second stop of a 
10-event national series featuring 24 classes in closed course, slalom and 
freestyle divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Amateur finals for men and women will be held Saturday; professionals will 
race Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cain was California champion in team roping when he was 22, then retired to 
start his own merchant financial assistance business in Newhall. Four years 
ago, he bought a vacation home on Mohave Lake, where he and his wife began 
riding Sea-Doos on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a couple of years, my friends quit riding with me because they said I 
was too aggressive," Cain said. "One day, I saw a Jet Ski race on TV and I 
said, 'I can do that.' The next weekend, I tried it and I've been racing almost 
every weekend since." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Cain planned to enter only the San Diego and Los Angeles races on 
the national schedule, but after a surprising victory in one event, he decided 
to tackle the full tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really a lark," he said. "We didn't even have a truck or trailer and 
we had to leave on Wednesday to make the next race at Denver. We bought the 
truck about an hour before we took off."

 Cain won four national events and qualified for the Skat-Trak World Finals 
last October at Lake Havasu City, Ariz., where he won the International Jet 
Sport Boating Assn.'s amateur/expert championship before an estimated 35,000 
spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world championship is a one-day event, not a series, and it all came down 
to a race between the oldest competitor, me, and the youngest, Chris Mays, who 
was 14 and looked younger. He won the slalom and I was second, but I had better 
finishes than he did in the limited and modified events, so I won overall." 
</P>
<P>
 Cain moved up to the professional ranks this year, and last week in the season 
opener at San Diego's Mission Bay he finished third in the slalom, posting the 
fastest time of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've turned what for many my age is strictly a means of recreational 
enjoyment (into a way) to fulfill my competitive fire," Cain said. "I'm proof 
that anyone at any age can enjoy personal watercraft." 
</P>
<P>
 Mays, of Vero Beach, Fla., is still competing as an amateur/expert. Last week 
at San Diego, he swept all events and is expected to do the same at 
Puddingstone. 
</P>
<P>
 Christy Carlson, 23, a five-time national champion from San Diego, is favored 
in the women's professional class after setting a world closed-course slalom 
record last week on her Kawasaki. The men's favorite is Victor Sheldon of 
Vista, also a Kawasaki rider, who is the defending national champion. Sheldon, 
27, started the 1994 season by winning overall honors at San Diego.

 Canyon's Nina Lindenberg scored two runs and drove in two more to lead the 
North a 7-0 victory over the South in the third Orange County North-South 
all-star softball game Wednesday at Brea-Olinda High. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindenberg scored the only run the North needed in the first inning against El 
Toro's Misty Lauby. 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-out walk, Lindenberg stole second and scored on a single by 
Cypress' Christa Saindon. Lindenberg also keyed the North's five-run third 
inning. Lauby surrendered six runs despite giving up only two hits in three 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 The South committed three errors in the third and three times allowed runners 
to reach base by failing to throw out the lead runner. 
</P>
<P>
 An error and two fielder's choices loaded the bases, and Lindenberg singled up 
the middle, scoring Los Alamitos' Debbie Wilson (two runs batted in) and 
Rosary's Nicola Walsh, whose slide allowed her to elude the catcher's tag. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge's Alison Johnsen had three of the South's four hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, Rancho Alamitos' Jill Otto and El Dorado's Heather Hamer combined for 
the shutout.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; TRAFFIC: GOOD SINGIN', GOOD PLAYIN', GOOD SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was no great sense of occasion, no buzz of anticipation as the reunited 
Traffic arrived at the Pond of Anaheim on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no great thematic subtext to lend fresh meaning to songs from more 
than 20 years ago: Traffic was always more about jams and melodies than lyrical 
ideas. There wasn't any essential new material to play, the revived band's "Far 
From Home" album having a lot more in common with the tired ramblings of 
co-leader Steve Winwood's last two solo releases than the adventurous spark of 
Traffic's prime years in the late '60s and early '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 There wasn't even a close-to-capacity crowd, which perhaps was inevitable for 
a classic-rock band arriving a few days after the Eagles had finished sucking 
something on the order of $8 million to $9 million in concert grosses out of 
the Southern California market. 
</P>
<P>
 But the youthful-looking Winwood, his worn and craggy old sidekick Jim Capaldi 
and their four supporting recruits managed to make a convincing case in favor 
of Traffic's rekindled existence. Their collective argument was simple and 
straightforward: good singin', good playin', good energy, good songs. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience didn't begin to stand and roar with approval until halfway 
through the two-hour show, when "Empty Pages" launched a closing string of some 
of the band's best-loved nuggets. But the vital signs were strong from the 
opening numbers: "Pearly Queen" and "Medicated Goo," two '60s-vintage songs 
that found Traffic playing it both bluesy and funky, showing a sharp group 
cohesion, but also enough limberness to free the show from the dull neatness of 
the "Far From Home" album. 
</P>
<P>
 The new album was acknowledged but not belabored. Early on, Traffic played 
three of its stronger songs in succession and kept the momentum going. But a 
stretch of languid numbers slowed the middle going of a show that bypassed two 
zestful gems of psychedelic pop, "Coloured Rain" and "Heaven Is in Your Mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, Traffic scored on the strength of a fine catalogue and excellent 
all-around musicianship. Winwood may not be "pound for pound the best musician 
on the planet," which is how Capaldi introduced him, but it's hard to think of 
a rock musician who can surpass his combined abilities as a singer, a guitarist 
and a piano and organ player. Each facet was given its due, culminating in a 
truly explosive "Dear Mr. Fantasy," in which Winwood's probing, cutting guitar 
lines and impassioned singing set a standard for middle-aged rockers trying to 
recapture a spark. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Allman Brothers Band in its strong '90s stage comeback, Traffic was 
worth hearing again even without new material that could match its most 
glorious past. It may have entered the show with two strikes against it, but, 
in the end, even a skeptic had to agree that a line from the show-closing 
refrain of "Gimme Some Lovin' " could sum up the live aspect of Traffic's 
reunion: so glad you made it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Traffic plays tonight through Saturday at the Universal Amphitheatre, 
Universal City, (818) 980-9421, 8:15 p.m. ($27.50-$62.50); Sunday at the Santa 
Barbara County Bowl, (805) 568-2695, 7 p.m. ($25-$32.50), and next Thursday at 
the Glen Helen Blockbuster Pavilion, Devore, (909) 886-8742, 8 p.m. ($23.50 -

IN THE HEART OF THE CITY; RECOVERY: EXECUTIVES TAKE A TOUR TO LOOK BEYOND THEIR 
RIOT-SCARRED IMAGES OF SOUTH-CENTRAL. THE AIM IS TO INCREASE INVESTMENT THERE. 
</P>

 Like tourists headed out for a turnaround trip to Las Vegas, four busloads of 
bankers and executives sallied forth Wednesday for a look at that place they 
had heard so much about: South-Central Los Angeles and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 But in this city where it is possible to drive the freeways for a lifetime and 
never set foot in the neighborhoods whizzing by, this was not exactly the inner 
city the captains of corporate Los Angeles had been led to expect. 
</P>
<P>
 There was Leimert Park, with its neat rows of Spanish-tile roofs. And Compton, 
with a new shopping complex and rising condo developments. And 
Watts-Willowbrook, with its gleaming Metro Rail station a stone's throw from 
the graffiti-scarred Imperial Courts housing project. 
</P>
<P>
 There were also the signs of decay that had for so long defined their view of 
the area. But from Crenshaw to Lynwood and back, there were also rows of neatly 
tended houses, manicured lawns and flower beds that proved the bright, common 
thread running through each community. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-hour tour, led by 28-year-old John Bryant, the director of the 
nonprofit Operation HOPE, was the organization's second annual Banker's Bus 
Tour, aimed at persuading the denizens of the city's wealthiest corporate 
enclaves to invest in its most neglected neighborhoods. Bryant -- a 
self-described broker of South-Central -- hit upon the idea last year as a way 
to pitch the area to corporate investors who might otherwise never venture into 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 The ride was determinedly upbeat, with Bryant at the helm of one bus acting as 
part tour guide and part wiseacre, intermittently spewing positive statistics 
about the inner city. ("Does anyone know of the 3,000 buildings damaged in the 
riots, how many were homes? None!") 
</P>
<P>
 When it was all over, many said their riot-influenced perceptions of the inner 
city had begun to change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seeing is believing," said Won H. Chung, president of Saehan Bank in 
Koreatown. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the first time I had ever gone through these areas. . . . Some of it 
was cozy and quiet; other parts were as I expected. But it made me realize, 
there has to be a cash flow, investment, for things to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant, whose group was formed in the wake of the 1992 riots to help revive 
the economy of the inner city, said he wanted to let investors see for 
themselves that what they might think of as an economic dead zone is brimming 
with opportunities for investment. Because it was exactly such a tour that 
sparked the formation of Operation HOPE, Bryant decided to turn it into a 
yearly event with the goal of showing the right people firsthand what 
South-Central and surrounding areas are made of. This year's focus, in keeping 
with Bryant's newly opened home loan center in Leimert Park, was housing.  
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I thought I knew the area pretty well. I had heard people call 
Crenshaw 'The Jungle,' so I figured that's how it looked," said Daniel 
Descargar, a distributor for a security electronics firm. "I was amazed that 
this was just a beautiful part of America. . . . There's really no color to it. 
It's the American dream." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For a few of Wednesday's "tourists," it was like going home again. "I grew up 
on South St. Andrews Place (in South-Central) about 35 years ago," said Dan 
Fedrick of South Bay Bank, leaning forward excitedly in his seat as the bus 
rumbled south on Van Ness Avenue. "And it hasn't changed a bit. It looks 
great!" 
</P>
<P>
 Yet as the bus rolled farther and farther south and east to Athens, Compton 
and Watts, as the cheery homes gave way to barren commercial strips, the crowd 
got noticeably quiet, as if the joy ride were entering a dark, forbidding 
tunnel.  
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted, Bryant called such junctures "challenging areas," pointing out that 
as in all neighborhoods, there is bad as well as good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad he (Bryant) said that," said Craig Hudson of the Independent Bankers 
Assn. "He didn't gloss things over, or try and show people only the best 
things. People have to understand this is a total community, and that there 
really is a need for funds." 
</P>
<P>
 The trip was not without its problems -- the buses pulled off late, and Rep. 
Walter R. Tucker III (D-Compton) came too late and was left in the dust. 
Bryant's assistant, Rachael Farr, tried to give directions over a cellular 
phone as the bus headed to West Imperial Highway and Van Ness Avenue at the 
southern tip of Inglewood, to a church and school waiting with midmorning 
refreshments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aren't we in Compton?" asked one businessman when Farr wondered aloud what 
part of the city the church was in. Corrections flew from all corners of the 
bus, and Bryant took up the discussion of exactly where -- and what -- 
South-Central is. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Kaye, a producer for "The McNeil-Lehrer Report," shook his head in 
amazement that with so many well-kept homes, South-Central's precious few 
lending institutions don't do more business with their own communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would bankers in the area have to take a tour of their own city?" he 
asked more than once. "Isn't it incredible?" 
</P>
<P>
 For Ann Brooks, a community investment officer at CenFed Bank in Pasadena, the 
ride was a shock to the senses, albeit a bracing one. "I've seen more of 
South-Central this morning than I've ever seen," she said. "I expected to see 
more graffiti, more 'For Sale' signs. It's been a real pleasant experience."

CHAPLAIN ADMITS HE MOLESTED 50 SCOUTS; COURTS: SEMINARY GRADUATE IS SENTENCED 
TO FIVE YEARS IN PRISON FOR ABUSING TWO YOUNGSTERS AT CATALINA SUMMER CAMPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A convicted child molester from Garden Grove admitted having sexual contact 
with more than 50 Boy Scouts while working as a chaplain at summer camps on 
Santa Catalina Island between 1991 and 1993, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Khamh Van Nguyen, 24, a Vietnamese immigrant, was sentenced in Long Beach 
Superior Court on Friday to five years in prison on charges that he molested an 
11-year-old and a 12-year-old at Cherry Valley Camp. 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles Sheriff's Department officials said they hope some of the 
dozens of other boys who were molested will contact detectives so Nguyen can be 
charged again. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Detective Doug Blaydes said the man targeted the Boy Scouts because 
the Catalina Island camps, which are attended by Scouts from across the country 
every summer, gave him discreet contact with the boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "He preferred the isolation of the island," Blaydes said.  
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen was a graduate of St. John's Seminary College in Camarillo, but other 
details of his background are sketchy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Schoenmehl, assistant executive with the Boy Scouts' San Gabriel Valley 
Council, said Nguyen emigrated from Vietnam. "As I understand it, he had a 
difficult arrival here in the States. There was some dramatic instance that 
happened that allowed him to get into the country. . . . He told a real 
tear-jerking, sad story."  
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen had worked with the Roman Catholic Church and youth programs in 
Vietnam, Schoenmehl said. He applied to work for the Boy Scouts locally and 
passed background screening and a six-day training program before he was 
accepted as a camp chaplain.  
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen also taught for about a week in September at St. John Bosco High School 
in Bellflower, but was suspended when the school discovered that he was being 
investigated on the molestation charges.  
</P>
<P>
 Blaydes said Nguyen told him he had been attracted to boys from a young age. 
"He was extremely graphic," Blaydes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two boys who pressed charges, both California residents, are traumatized 
and are in counseling, Blaydes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoenmehl said the organization did not know Nguyen had confessed to abusing 
so many boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know he had contact with a great many people," Schoenmehl said, "but the 
information we had from police was that it was just these two victims." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Walker, a national Boy Scouts spokesman, said the organization gave 
the police a list of more than 500 boys with whom Nguyen had contact. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boy Scouts does the best it can to ensure that campers are safe, 
Schoenmehl said, but Nguyen was "very clever and slipped through the cracks. 
All the background checks we did showed he was considered a wonderful man."  
</P>
<P>
 Blaydes said this was one of the worst cases of child molestation he has 
investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the position (Nguyen) had as a teacher and a leader, he did everything 
in the world against his own personal beliefs and violated the boys and 
everything they understood," Blaydes said.

LOCAL ELECTIONS; YAROSLAVSKY HAS AGGRESSIVE PLANS; GOVERNMENT: NEW COUNTY 
SUPERVISOR IS LIKELY TO BE A DRIVING FORCE, OBSERVERS SAY. BUT IT WILL TAKE 
TIME, SOME CAUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, newly elected to the county Board 
of Supervisors, brings an aggressive agenda for change to the Hall of 
Administration, and many local officials said Wednesday that he may possess the 
political savvy, budgeting skills and populist ideology to accomplish much of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 After Yaroslavsky passed twice on races for mayor of Los Angeles, many 
political analysts thought his political career had reached a dead end. But now 
fellow elected officials say he has a chance to play a key role in reshaping 
one of the most powerful legislative bodies in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll be the motivating force on the board," said City Councilman Hal 
Bernson, who has worked side by side with Yaroslavsky for 15 years. "He'll 
quickly take charge." 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky is proposing an overhaul of the county's notoriously complex and 
secretive budgeting process. He wants to make peace with the county's unions 
while holding the line on raises. He is questioning the fundamental approach to 
health care by asking whether the county should even own hospitals and says 
he'll quickly propose campaign finance reform. 
</P>
<P>
 And as the supervisor for the 3rd District, which includes much of the 
Westside and San Fernando Valley, he will work to protect open space in the 
Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't be boring," City Councilman Richard Alatorre said. "He's not an 
ideologue. He's a doer, he's a reformer." 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky, who will replace the retiring Ed Edelman in December, will be the 
third new supervisor to join the board in as many years, following the 
elections of follow Democrats Gloria Molina and Yvonne Brathwaite Burke. His 
arrival is seen by many as the element necessary to reach a critical mass for 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke said Yaroslavsky will provide the third vote necessary to "solidify the 
reform bloc" on the board. Burke said she and Molina want to introduce ways to 
handle the massive county budget, such as the line-item budgeting, and pare 
back long-established perks for officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina agreed. She said he'll help form "a solid bloc for fiscal 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll be a positive change," said Molina, who served with Yaroslavsky on the 
City Council for four years. "Zev is like me, he likes to scrutinize a lot of 
things. Now I won't be the only one asking the hard questions." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who anchors the conservative 
wing of the board, said he is looking forward to having Yaroslavsky as an ally 
for beefing up the budgets of sheriff, district attorney and other public 
safety departments. 
</P>
<P>
 At the City Council, where he arrived in 1976 as a 26-year old, longhaired 
activist, Yaroslavsky quickly developed an expertise in budget matters. As 
chair of the Budget and Finance Committee for the last decade, he played a lead 
role in drafting many city spending plans. 
</P>
<P>
 He is difficult to label either as a liberal or conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he championed social programs, as head of the Budget Committee he 
often was compelled to pare them back to balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 He has remained close to the unions, although he successfully advocated 
no-raise contracts for most employees. And although he fought for more money 
for the Los Angeles Police Department, he also advocated sweeping reforms and 
the removal of former Police Chief Daryl F. Gates. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was unable to achieve his agenda through the council, Yaroslavsky has 
tried some less traditional approaches. He sponsored the successful ballot 
measures to regulate growth and halt oil drilling in the Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Wednesday, Yaroslavsky said he would consider going to the 
ballot again to achieve some goals at the county as well. If the state 
Legislature does not allow the county to tap new revenue sources, he said, he 
would consider a ballot measure to give local jurisdictions more power to levy 
"sin" taxes on alcohol, tobacco and firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some officials who are familiar with the tradition-bound ways of the 
county say Yaroslavsky may have to crawl before he can walk. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no training ground for this," Supervisor Deane Dana said. "The county 
is a big, complex place. Until you've been here, you can't imagine what it is 
like. It will take him some time to gain the experience." 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Nate Holden, who served as a supervisorial aide to Kenneth 
Hahn for 13 years, agreed, saying the differences between the city and county 
are enormous. 
</P>
<P>
 "People there are very strong-willed, every one of them," Holden said. "You 
can be part of the routine, or you can upset the apple cart and not get a 
second" on your motion. Holden said that in time Yaroslavsky will learn the 
rules. "He's smart enough to know that if you can't break 'em, bend 'em a 
little." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Edelman echoed the sentiments of Dana and Holden. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like the City Council, where you make speeches," he said. "This is a 
governing body. You need to line up your votes." 
</P>
<P>
 Some elected officials said that style, rather than philosophy, may well be 
the biggest change between Yaroslavsky and Edelman. 
</P>
<P>
 John Ferraro, who worked along side Edelman at the City Council in the 1970s, 
joked that they once missed a quorum because the cautious Edelman "was 
downstairs and couldn't decide to take the stairs or the elevator. Now Zev, on 
the other hand, he takes off a little too quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky acknowledges the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ed is the one you want when you need to bring warring parties together," he 
said. "Me?, I'm a warring party. . . . I'm provocative. I take risks, I'm an 
activist." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the pugilistic imagery, Yaroslavsky is actually hoping to be a 
peacemaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic development efforts, he said, are hampered by the deep-seated enmity 
between the city and county governments. 
</P>
<P>
 The two governments have been at odds for years on a host of issues, including 
development plans and homeless programs and are currently suing each other over 
the collection of parking taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping that the city and county can work together on economic 
development," said Yaroslavsky, emphasizing his close relationship with Los 
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky and his new colleagues will have a honeymoon of sorts. He won't 
take office until Dec. 5., allowing for a six-month transition effort. 
</P>
<P>
 But Molina, who made the same move from City Hall to the Hall of 
Administration, said her advice is simple: "Bust right through the door and 
roll up your sleeves."

LOCAL ELECTIONS; PARKLAND AGENCY LEFT HIGH AND DRY; PROP. 180: DEFEAT OF 
MEASURE MEANS SANTA MONICA CONSERVANCY MUST LAY OFF STAFF AND PUT LAND 
ACQUISITIONS ON HOLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A day after voters rejected a $2-billion bond measure to buy parkland, the 
Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy found itself Wednesday in a familiar 
situation: underfunded and under fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 180 would have directed more than $85 million to the state agency 
to acquire open land in the Santa Monica Mountains from Griffith Park to Point 
Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the conservancy and a sister agency -- the Mountains Recreation and 
Conservation Authority -- will be forced to lay off more than one-third of 
their employees and put off critical property acquisitions as their limited 
funding dwindles further, said Joseph T. Edmiston, the conservancy's executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Edmiston refused to concede total defeat. He said the conservancy is 
still owed more than $13 million by the National Park Service for other 
acquisitions in the mountains and still has a small amount of cash in accounts 
earmarked for special projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to sit back and say, 'The people have spoken' and let the 
environment of Santa Monica Mountains go down the tubes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most significantly, Proposition 180's failure calls into question the 
conservancy's effort to pull off what was heralded a few months ago as one of 
its greatest accomplishments: the last-minute, $19.9-million purchase of Canyon 
Oaks Estates, a huge swath of Topanga Canyon land proposed for development. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics outside the agency doubt the conservancy will be able to come up 
with the $5.8 million it owes on part of the property before next year, when 
the developer is entitled to propose a new project. 
</P>
<P>
 And even some of the conservancy's staunchest allies grumble that the 
high-profile purchase of Canyon Oaks was a high-priced mistake that leaves the 
agency without money to buy other important parcels at a time when the cost of 
vacant land is at its lowest in years. 
</P>
<P>
 The price of Canyon Oaks was the highest the conservancy has paid for a single 
property since its creation in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy officials conceded when they bought Canyon Oaks in April that they 
did not have enough money to close the deal. They even put other acquisitions 
on hold to come up with the initial payment of $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
 They counted on Proposition 180 to not only round out the remainder of the 
Canyon Oaks money, but also to put other purchases back on track. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston said it was realistic to count on Proposition 180 funds because 
voters have been willing to fund parkland measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Political consultant Mark Litchman, who has worked for the conservancy, said 
most parks agencies have no choice but to rely on voters to stay alive.

GROUND TURBULENCE; WINDS AT LAX THREATEN HUGE CANVAS WALL MURAL FOR WORLD CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It looked more like the start of the America's Cup than the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 There Lilya Voroby was, barking out orders to her crew to pull the ropes and 
hoist the canvas into the wind as she tried to tack to the left. 
</P>
<P>
 Except that Voroby was at Los Angeles International Airport on Wednesday 
afternoon -- not the ocean. And instead of clutching the wheel of a 12-meter 
racing yacht, she was hanging on to the edge of a 46 1/2-foot-tall soccer 
mural. 
</P>
<P>
 She was trying to hang the hand-painted mural on the side of an airport 
parking structure elevator tower as a welcome to sports fans arriving for the 
upcoming World Cup soccer matches. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 30 m.p.h. wind that funnels past the United Airlines terminal was 
causing the $35,000 mural to billow and snap like a mainsail caught in a 
hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second day that Voroby had struggled to attach the 40-foot-wide, 
half-ton mural on the airport wall. On Tuesday, the mural had turned out to be 
too heavy for the rod it was rolled onto and had bent in the middle as it was 
being hoisted off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The colorful painting is one of five murals around town commissioned by World 
Cup organizers to promote the soccer championships. It is the only one designed 
to hang from a wall instead of being attached to it, however. 
</P>
<P>
 The mural's billowing sent artist Willie Herron bellowing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to raise it like a sail," said Herron, 40, a native of City 
Terrace. "When I got here and saw what was happening, I blew up. They're 
jeopardizing my work. This is real serious." 
</P>
<P>
 Herron, who spent 16 hours a day for two months painting the mural with 
assistant Umberto Caiafa, 29, said the flapping has caused the paint and sealer 
used on the canvas to crack. That means the painting -- depicting soccer 
players reaching for a globe -- could wash away the first time it rains. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is supposed to be up until 1999. It may not last the week." 
</P>
<P>
 The five soccer murals were commissioned by World Cup officials through a 
Venice-based group called the Social and Public Art Resource Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Debra Padilla, associate director of the center, said airport officials 
insisted on a hanging mural that could be removed easily because the city may 
soon use the wall for revenue-producing advertising. She said World Cup leaders 
chose the elevator wall, even though airport officials warned that the site was 
a "wind channel." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Winfrey, a Department of Airports spokesman, replied: "The mural was 
presented to us as a temporary thing. We are considering advertising at the 
airport, but where and how has not been determined." 
</P>
<P>
 The flapping mural was causing a mural flap of another kind from onlookers, 
meantime. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving passenger Juan Quesada of Puerto Rico said the soccer players in the 
painting looked more like rugby players to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take it down!" said airport baggage handler Charles L. Davis III. "We don't 
want to look at this thing for four years." The Laker Girls might be a better 
subject, he suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport security guard Michael Simpson pronounced the mural's pastel colors 
"dull looking." 
</P>
<P>
 But airport passenger Guy Wright, a Miami jewelry designer, praised the colors 
as "exquisite." "The minute I walked out of the terminal and saw it I said, 
'Wow, that's beautiful!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Bobbi Vix of Chatsworth agreed. "It's cheery and very optimistic looking," she 
said. Back at the elevator shaft, Herron shook his head. "I wish I could have 
painted it directly on the wall," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-five feet over his head, Voroby was gradually getting an upper hand with 
the balky canvas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish he'd painted it on the wall too," she said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: WELFARE MOTHER OF 2 
REALIZES A DREAM WITH COLLEGE DEGREE 
</P>

 Olympic gold medalist Florence Griffith Joyner on Wednesday exhorted the class 
of 1994 to persevere despite adversity, but one Cal State Northridge graduate 
already had learned that lesson all too well. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, Irene Brennick's husband left her with two children to bring 
up and only a welfare check for support. Like Joyner, who overcame poverty to 
become the most decorated sprinter in U.S. Olympic history, Brennick surmounted 
daunting obstacles in pursuit of her goal: a college degree. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, Brennick, 34, graduated with honors at an outdoor ceremony for 
1,000 students, underscored by Griffith Joyner's stirring words. The occasion 
capped four days of graduation events at the quake-damaged school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to be discouraged today, but you must fight on," said Griffith 
Joyner, who briefly attended CSUN before transferring to UCLA. "Have faith 
through hard times. That's what life rewards -- perseverance."  
</P>
<P>
 Brennick knew exactly what she meant. Swallowing her pride, she had managed to 
feed, clothe and shelter her family on an annual income of about $12,000 by 
working part-time and accepting scholarships and welfare benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past five years, she hasn't had a weekend away from the kids, gone to 
the movies or bought a single item of new clothing for herself or her 
daughters, she said. Until recently, she even shared a bedroom with her 
children.  
</P>
<P>
 "I learned to live on nothing," said Brennick, a wiry woman with large hazel 
eyes, a Boston accent and an easy smile. "People ask me what I'll do when I'm 
working and have enough money. I tell you, it'll be a luxury just to buy paper 
towels."  
</P>
<P>
 Brennick said her quest was even more difficult because of the low 
expectations nearly everyone she met had of welfare recipients. Strangers in 
the line at the grocery store jeered when she paid the bill with food stamps, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It took all the strength she could muster to continue her education in the 
face of state and federal regulations that she criticized as discouraging 
people to better themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 But buoyed by her religious beliefs, Brennick eventually found 
state-subsidized child care and a supportive church to help her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew deep down I was a good person no matter what society said about people 
like me," Brennick said. "I knew all along I was a winner whose husband just 
happened to walk out." 
</P>
<P>
 Brennick has been on the dean's list every semester since she enrolled, first 
at Pierce College and then at CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was an excellent student," said Isabelle Walker, a CSUN professor who 
guided Brennick's academic career. "She's very optimistic. That might have put 
her ahead of other welfare mothers in the same situation." 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, she is an intern at United Way and plans to go off welfare once 
she finds a permanent job as a fund-raiser.  
</P>
<P>
 "I love asking rich people for money to help the poor," she said. "I'm a 
living example of what good it does." TRACEY KAPLAN

<P>
 A man was arrested Wednesday on suspicion of kidnaping and raping 15 women in 
the Wilshire and Hollywood areas over the past four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Patrick Mitchell, 33, of Los Angeles, allegedly began his crime rampage 
by kidnaping lone women coming out of restaurants. More recently, he allegedly 
began kidnaping and sexually assaulting women in pairs, said Los Angeles Police 
Lt. Ross Moen.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the victims were white brunettes in their early 20s who were abducted 
while leaving restaurants, then robbed and raped, Moen said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; GARCETTI 
URGES REVISION OF 'THREE STRIKES' LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unless the "three strikes you're out" law is limited to violent repeat 
offenders, the justice system will be crippled and civil courts will have to 
close down, Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti predicted Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County prosecutors have filed 443 third-strike cases and 1,234 
second-strike cases since March, when Gov. Pete Wilson signed the three strikes 
law, Garcetti said. Most will go to trial, he said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do believe in the three strikes principle," he said. "But it should 
reserved for the violent repeat offender." Otherwise, he said, "The civil 
courts will have to close down because criminal cases take precedence." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti said he and a delegation including the family of murder victim Polly 
Klaas will go to Sacramento on Thursday to urge the Senate to adopt Assembly 
Bill 167. They will also ask Wilson to sign the bill and put it on the November 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill provides for life sentences without parole for serious or violent 
felons convicted of a third strike. Under the initiative already on the 
November ballot, the third strike may be any felony, including petty theft, and 
the sentence is 25 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti said the current three strikes law, which is identical to the one on 
the ballot, is clogging the system with trials because those facing life in 
prison are unwilling to plea bargain.

A DEAD ZONE'S HISTORY; WRITER DETAILS COVER-UP OF JAPAN GERM WARFARE TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A few months after Japan surrendered in World War II, an elaborate funeral was 
held in a village outside Tokyo to mark the death of a wealthy general who had 
supervised gruesome human experiments as part of the Japanese Army's germ 
warfare program. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lt. Gen. Shiro Ishii wasn't dead, according to a new book by retired Cal 
State Northridge history professor Sheldon H. Harris. The funeral -- complete 
with mourners, priests and burnt incense -- was a ruse to throw American war 
crimes investigators off his trail, Harris writes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ishii eventually was found and provided American authorities with details of 
Japanese biological warfare tests in Manchuria that killed large numbers of 
Chinese. In exchange, U.S. officials agreed not to prosecute him for crimes 
against humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Factories of Death: Japanese Biological Warfare 1932-45 and the American 
Cover Up," Harris writes that American officials struck a bargain with Ishii to 
avoid a public trial that would reveal details of Japanese germ experiments to 
the Soviets as the Cold War dawned. 
</P>
<P>
 After he came out of hiding, Ishii played a clever game with U.S. authorities, 
receiving them at his home dressed in his best kimono, releasing tantalizing 
bits of information as he held out for a written guarantee that he would not be 
prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 Wary of the political uproar that might ensue if the deal became public, the 
U.S. government covered it up for decades and even today continues to withhold 
information, according to Harris' book. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris learned of the Japanese experiments while lecturing on American history 
at Chinese universities in 1984. A Chinese professor urged him to visit the 
remnants of a huge germ warfare plant outside the Manchurian city of Harbin 
that was run by Ishii's dreaded Unit 731. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what he was talking about, so I was very polite and said, 
'Sure. Be delighted to,' " said Harris, 65, sitting in the sun-dappled patio 
behind his Granada Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, he was researching in another Manchurian city, Changchun, when the 
Tian An Men Square massacre occurred in far-away Beijing. Pro-democracy 
activists clogged the streets of Changchun, making it impossible to reach the 
railway station. He finally was able to flee by hitching a ride on a plane 
chartered by some friendly Canadians. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say it was a pleasant experience, but it was one of the most 
extraordinary experiences of my entire life, doing this book. The people I met, 
the places I went to. . . . I was riding camels in Inner Mongolia. That's 
something not many people do, especially at my age," said Harris, grinning. 
</P>
<P>
 Peppering the U.S. government with requests under the Freedom of Information 
Act, Harris obtained 1,000 pages of documents -- many formerly classified -- 
detailing how the U.S. handled Japanese germ scientists after the war. At one 
government office, he got some unexpected help when a bureaucrat plunked down a 
stack of papers that he hadn't been aware of. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'You don't know where you got this. When you get back to California, 
Xerox it and send it back,' " recalled Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although American scientists at first thought that there was much to learn 
from the Japanese, they later concluded that the U.S. Army's biological warfare 
program was far more advanced, Harris said. The Japanese never produced usable 
germ weapons of mass destruction, but U.S. forces were ready to manufacture 
enough bacteria bombs for large-scale attacks on Japan by the war's end, he 
writes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The data Ishii and the others furnished the United States with were -- at 
best -- of minor significance," he writes. "The cost to the United States in 
terms of honor and integrity appears to be high in comparison to the worth of 
the material it purchased from Ishii and the remaining BW (biological warfare) 
specialists." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, U.S. officials have reluctantly confirmed giving immunity to 
Ishii, who died of throat cancer in 1956. But the Japanese government has never 
acknowledged that Unit 731 carried out experiments on live humans in Harbin and 
other Chinese cities during the 1930s and 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris' book focuses on the brilliant but ruthless Ishii, a wealthy 
landowner's son who became a doctor before joining the army in 1920. 
</P>
<P>
 Possessed of a booming voice and almost superhuman energy, Ishii was a 
relentless womanizer who often went on all-night drinking binges and prowled 
local geisha houses after a hard day's work at an army hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1920s, he became convinced that biological weapons offered Japan a 
particularly cheap and effective battlefield weapon, and set out to persuade 
his army superiors. In the prewar years, his efforts helped make Japan the 
world's leader in germ warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1932, after Japan had brutally occupied Manchuria in northern China, Ishii, 
then a major, erected a biological warfare station in the village of Beiyinhe, 
south of the bustling Manchurian metropolis of Harbin, according to Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 In later years, Ishii and his cohorts -- many of whom became prominent 
scientists, academics and businessmen after the war -- built several more germ 
warfare facilities throughout Manchuria, turning the region "into one huge 
biological warfare laboratory," Harris writes. 
</P>
<P>
 By far the biggest was the Ping Fan complex, also south of Harbin. Its 76 
buildings included laboratories, dormitories for civilian workers, barns for 
test animals, greenhouses and a special prison for human test subjects. Built 
on six square kilometers, it employed 3,000 Japanese doctors, technicians and 
soldiers and rivaled Auschwitz in size. 
</P>
<P>
 For pure grisliness, Ishii's experiments were on a par with those of the 
infamous Nazi doctors, who performed horrific medical "tests" on Jews and other 
concentration-camp inmates, according to Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 Ping Fan prisoners -- often Chinese guerrillas, criminals or ordinary citizens 
snatched off the streets of Harbin -- were injected with plague, typhus, 
smallpox, cholera and other deadly diseases. They died in slow, feverish agony, 
with Japanese scientists observing them closely to see the exact doses needed 
to kill humans. 
</P>
<P>
 The local population was told that the vast death complex was actually a 
lumber mill. Among themselves, the Japanese mockingly referred to human test 
subjects as " marutas ," or logs. 
</P>
<P>
 While prisoners lived in terror, Ishii and his colleagues lived in relative 
luxury. They enjoyed swimming pools, a bar, gardens, a 1,000-seat auditorium, a 
Shinto temple, even a brothel. Ishii lived in a Harbin mansion, commuting to 
his death lab in a chauffeured limousine heavy with armor plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides killing captives at Ping Fan, the Japanese conducted "field tests" 
against both Chinese troops and civilians. Ishii and his operatives slipped 
into towns and villages, poisoning water wells and even feeding local children 
chocolates laced with anthrax, Harris writes. 
</P>
<P>
 Because many records were destroyed during and after the war, there is no 
reliable count of how many people died in Japanese germ warfare operations. But 
Harris estimates that the total was in the hundreds of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ishii and his underlings killed at least 12,000 prisoners at Ping Fan and 
other death factories, and probably far more, Harris writes. Tens of thousands 
more died in the field tests and in epidemics that erupted in Manchuria during 
and after the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris writes that Unit 731's victims included Han Chinese, White Russian 
exiles, Harbin Jews and Soviet prisoners of war. But he casts doubt on the 
persistent rumor that Ishii experimented on American POWs, saying no U.S. 
servicemen interned at the big Mukden prison camp reported such treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ishii and others were able to freely kill human test subjects because "they 
knew their victims were inferior beings who were being sacrificed to a higher 
cause," writes Harris. "The superior Japanese race would benefit immeasurably 
from the sacrifices of people who were, in general, of little value to 
mankind." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris says that ironically, the American biological warfare program, begun 
only in 1943, was far superior to the Japanese. By 1945, the United States was 
preparing to produce 1 million small bombs laden with anthrax that could have 
been dropped on Japan.

HOTEL OKS 4-YEAR CONTRACT ON EVE OF WORLD CUP; LABOR: UNION HAD BEEN READY TO 
STAGE MULTIETHNIC PROTESTS AT THE RADISSON WILSHIRE PLAZA, THE SITE OF A BITTER 
DISPUTE IN 1992. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK J. McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Averting a divisive battle just as thousands of visitors are arriving for the 
World Cup soccer tournament, management of a major Koreatown hotel has 
unexpectedly agreed to a new four-year contract with unionized workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor leaders called last week's contract signing at the Radisson Wilshire 
Plaza a major victory in their aggressive push to organize low-wage, mostly 
Latino immigrant hotel employees throughout the Los Angeles area. Workers had 
accused owners of attempting to break the union and reduce wages and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was an extremely important victory for us," said Maria Elena Durazo, 
president of Local 11 of the Hotel Employees & Restaurant Employees Union. "All 
we're looking for is some respect for the workers and for the union's position. 
. . . If we hadn't won, we would have been allowing standards that are already 
too low to deteriorate further." 
</P>
<P>
 Many had feared that the anticipated battle centering on the predominantly 
Latino work force could signify a repeat of a racially charged 1992 labor 
dispute. The dispute resulted in almost a year of picketing outside the same 
facility after it was bought by the Seoul-based Koreana chain. 
</P>
<P>
 But activists said the accord illustrated how employers could avoid such 
confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The implications here could be far-reaching in terms of educating corporate 
citizens who are coming into this community from other countries that don't 
have a history of labor unions," said Angela Oh, an attorney who is active in 
Korean American and other community issues. 
</P>
<P>
 In a novel show of unity, workers say, Korean American restaurant employees at 
the hotel joined with Latino staffers in forming a cross-cultural front to face 
management. That development heartened union strategists who were grappling 
with ways to organize immigrant work forces that are often fragmented along 
ethnic lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilshire Plaza's estimated 130 workers, whose previous contract was to 
expire this week, approved the new pact unanimously Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although management preferred a shorter contract, the owners agreed to the 
four-year accord in an effort to promote harmony and get on with business, said 
Wayne Williams, the hotel's asset manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were not interested in having a war," said Williams, who participated in 
the negotiations and denied any intention to break the union. 
</P>
<P>
 Local 11 activists had placed top priority on retaining a favorable contract 
at the Wilshire Plaza. The 12-story, 397-room hotel -- the largest in the 
Koreatown/Mid-Wilshire area -- is one of only a dozen or so major Los 
Angeles-area hotels with unionized work forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Having launched a high-profile organizing campaign throughout the region 
earlier this year, Local 11 strategists decided their movement could not afford 
a setback at a facility that was already unionized. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were ready to throw everything we had at this," said Jennifer Skurnik, 
staff director for Local 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating a lengthy struggle, the union had prepared a major public 
relations campaign, which was to include a multiethnic march through Koreatown 
this week and other highly visible actions during the World Cup. Some Asian 
American groups had vowed to lend their support. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not all Koreans or Korean Americans in the community were going to sit by and 
let hotel management go about its previous anti-union practices," said Paul 
Lee, an organizer for the Korean Immigrant Workers Advocates, a community group 
supportive of the hotel employees. 
</P>
<P>
 A letter-writing initiative started last month targeted hotel management and 
Hang Kyung Kim, the South Korean consul general in Los Angeles. (The hotel's 
parent chain is owned by the prominent Bang family, who are also chief 
proprietors of Chosun Ilbo, South Korea's largest daily newspaper.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles does not want another bitter, divisive conflict at a time when 
what our city most needs is reconciliation and economic development," the union 
wrote to supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The mid-priced hotel (formerly known as the Wilshire Hyatt and Wilshire 
Koreana) is a social anchor in the Koreatown/Mid-Wilshire area, the site of 
many banquets, business meetings and other events. 
</P>
<P>
 In accepting the union's demands, management essentially agreed to a four-year 
extension of workers' existing contract. The pact is modeled after a citywide 
agreement that covers about 6,000 unionized hotel workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract includes free medical and dental benefits, job security 
protections and a $1.45-per-hour raise for non-tipped employees during the life 
of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, wages for non-tipped employees at the Wilshire Plaza range from 
$6.70 an hour for room attendants to $11 for cooks. At comparable non-union 
hotels, labor leaders say, such salaries range from about $5 to $8 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilshire Plaza's acrimonious recent labor history has given the facility a 
special symbolic importance to labor leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 When the hotel was still part of the Hyatt chain, Local 11 fought for more 
than two years in a bitter but ultimately successful campaign to win a 
contract. Shortly after signing a pact with the union, however, Hyatt sold the 
Wilshire facility to Koreana.

jobless; some had worked there for 20 years.

ALAMO CONVICTED, CLEARING WAY FOR L.A. CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Flamboyant evangelist Tony Alamo was convicted on federal tax charges in 
Memphis, Tenn., on Wednesday, clearing the way for him to return to Los Angeles 
to stand trial on charges that he ordered the beating of a young boy at his 
onetime Saugus commune. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing in the Saugus case is scheduled today in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
Alamo is accused of directing four men via telephone from another location to 
strike 11-year-old Jeremiah Miller 140 times with a large paddle at the Mint 
Canyon commune in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 A Memphis grand jury indicted Alamo in April, 1993, on charges of filing a 
false income tax return in 1985 and failing to file tax returns the next three 
years. Federal court jurors in Memphis found the former country singer guilty 
on all counts Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Alamo faces a maximum penalty of six years in prison and a $550,000 fine, said 
Dan Boone, an Internal Revenue Service spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Alamo, whose real name is Bernie Lazar Hoffman, had blamed Satan for his woes 
when he was arrested. But Alamo cannot find a defense for his tax problems in 
the Bible, said Justice Department lawyer Christopher Belcher, who noted in his 
closing arguments that the Bible says Christ was born after Joseph and Mary 
returned to Bethlehem to pay their taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "All Tony Alamo had to do was go to the mailbox and drop a return in the 
mail," Belcher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alamo's attorney, Jeffrey Dickstein, blamed Alamo's legal troubles on his 
ex-wives, overbearing government agencies and former church members, many of 
them former drug addicts. He said Alamo's businesses operated at a loss and 
that Alamo had no income. 
</P>
<P>
 IRS officials say Alamo and his wife, Susan, who died of cancer in 1982, 
shortchanged the IRS an estimated $10 million in taxes on income earned from a 
variety of businesses, using the tax-exempt Tony and Susan Alamo Christian 
Foundation and later the Music Square Church. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alamos founded the Holy Alamo Christian Church in the 1960s, taking young 
dropouts and drug users off the streets of Hollywood and providing them with 
food, shelter and anti-Catholic religious sermons. 
</P>
<P>
 Their religious following grew to hundreds of members in California, Arkansas 
and Tennessee in the 1970s and 1980s, when communes and church-owned businesses 
staffed with free labor from their followers earned millions of dollars, 
particularly off production of glitzy, rhinestone-studded denim jackets that 
sold in exclusive boutiques for as much as $600 each.

RETIREMENT FUNDS RULED OUT FOR BUDGET; FINANCES: THE EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION 
BOARD TELLS THE COUNTY TO FIND SOME OTHER WAY TO REDUCE ITS DEFICIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A proposal to use $150 million in Los Angeles County employee retirement funds 
to help balance the county's rickety budget was pronounced dead Wednesday by 
retirement officials who said such a move might harm their own finances. 
</P>
<P>
 The county will have to find some other way to close its deficit, said members 
of the board of the Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Assn. at their 
monthly meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means the county has less revenue to fund their services," board Chairman 
Robert Hermann said after the meeting. "But that $150 million should never have 
been included in the county's calculations." 
</P>
<P>
 County Chief Administrative Officer Sally Reed said Wednesday that she had not 
had a chance to talk to the retirement association's officials and could not 
judge what impact the loss would have on the county's fragile spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will follow this now and see if it absolutely closes off any option or 
determine if there might be some other possibilities," she said. "We are 
concerned about the $150 million, we are concerned about what is happening with 
the state budget; we are going to have to pursue every option for getting more 
state and federal revenue." 
</P>
<P>
 Reed last month submitted a $14.7-billion budget to the Board of Supervisors 
that includes a deficit of about $184 million. The proposed budget calls for 
1,100 layoffs and deep cuts in health, welfare, cultural and recreation 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 A major source of revenue in Reed's proposed budget had relied on agreement 
being reached with the retirement association to siphon $150 million in excess 
earnings to the county to help pay for programs that might otherwise face cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Retirement officials early on said they opposed the plan. That opposition was 
cemented Wednesday when a report was presented to the association by an 
independent consultant showing that the pension fund's own deficit grew by $362 
million in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials declared that any excess earnings must be used to pay off the 
retirement system's own debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Yvonne Brathwaite Burke expressed 
disappointment at the events but held out hope that the county and the 
association could reach some other agreement that would allow use of retirement 
funds to help pay for county programs.

LONG BEACH ELECTS FORMER COLLEGE PRESIDENT AS MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a relatively close contest, Long Beach voters elected a first-time 
politician to the mayor's office Tuesday, giving former community college 
president Beverly O'Neill the nod over two-term City Councilman Ray Grabinski. 
</P>
<P>
 City voters also elected their first Latina to the City Council, former school 
board member Jenny Oropeza, and may have elected two -- if Tonia Reyes Uranga's 
29-vote lead over her challenger holds up. An undetermined number of absentee 
and other ballots have yet to be counted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach election, which also saw veteran Councilman Warren Harwood 
ousted in favor of a new challenger, was one of a handful of municipal 
elections held throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Monica, a $27.1-million plan to revamp the Civic Center complex won 
voter approval by a surprisingly wide margin of more than 60%. The vote allows 
the city to convert decades-old parking lots and other property into parks, 
ponds, walkways and affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision on ballot measures D and E also gave a green light to RAND Corp., 
Santa Monica's third-largest private employer, to expand the company's nearby 
headquarters and develop other properties. Opponents contended that the massive 
renovation would cost too much and cause traffic bottlenecks and environmental 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In Long Beach, O'Neill, 63, will replace Mayor Ernie Kell, the city's only 
mayor since voters made the job full-time in 1988. Kell ran fifth among 13 
candidates in the city's April primary. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill, who narrowly led Grabinski in the primary, defeated him in Tuesday's 
runoff 53% to 47% 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a measure to reform campaign financing passed by a healthy margin. 
Modeled after a similar reform in Los Angeles, Long Beach's Proposition M will 
offer matching campaign money to candidates who agree to limit spending. 
</P>
<P>
 One important difference in Long Beach's reform, backers said, is that 
lawmakers closed a loophole that allowed Los Angeles mayoral candidate Michael 
Woo to accept city campaign money in 1992 and then legally exceed spending 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is terrific," said Councilman Alan Lowenthal, who introduced the measure 
that could cost taxpayers $1 million every four years. "This means that nobody 
can buy an election here." 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach may see a much-changed City Council after new members are sworn in 
July 19. Currently, there are eight white males and one black female on the 
council. But if Uranga's slim lead over opponent Mike Donelon holds up, the 
council will include three minority women.

SHERIFF BLOCK, ASSESSOR HAHN SAY STAFFS SHARE THEIR VICTORIES; COUNTY: BOTH 
TELL EMPLOYEES THAT REELECTION IS A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE IN THEIR DEPARTMENTS' 
PERFORMANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheriff Sherman Block and Los Angeles County Assessor Kenneth P. Hahn savored 
reelection victories Wednesday by advising the personnel in their departments 
that the votes for them amounted to a vote of confidence in the work the 
employees are doing. 
</P>
<P>
 In a message to all 12,000 sheriff's deputies and non-sworn members of his 
agency, Block declared, "My reelection is not so much a personal victory as it 
is a reflection of how the people we serve view (your) performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn too declared, "This is not only a vote of confidence for me but also for 
the employees in my department." 
</P>
<P>
 Block ended up getting 53.5% of the votes in the sheriff's race, which had six 
candidates, and Hahn got 56.5% of the vote in a 16-candidate race. Both 
officeholders thus escaped November runoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Block's margin was the lowest of any of the four sheriff's races he has won. 
This time he had an opponent, sheriff's reserve captain and businessman Robert 
Irmas, who outspent him and had a TV ad campaign while Block had none. Hahn, by 
contrast, faced little advertising and few mailings against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign consultant Joseph Cerrell, not affiliated with any of the candidates 
in either race, said Wednesday, "The constituency of Los Angeles County offices 
is greater than 44 states of the Union. How do you unseat an incumbent when you 
have to reach 10 million people just to find those who vote?" 
</P>
<P>
 Another reflection of how difficult it is to overcome the high name 
identification of the officeholders was runner-up Irmas' suggestion that next 
time he might try to run for an office in a district with a smaller area and 
population, where his campaign funds would stretch further. 
</P>
<P>
 Block said in an interview that he was well satisfied with his margin of 
victory. "I feel I won by a landslide when you consider my nearest runner-up 
got only 17% of the vote," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn, meanwhile, took issue with those who suggest that the only reason he 
keeps winning is that the voters confuse him with retired Supervisor Kenneth 
Hahn, a much-loved Los Angeles political figure over many decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure (my victories are) not a confusion with the former supervisor," the 
assessor said in an interview. "The name has been good, the name is 
recognizable, but it is also recognizable for the achievements I have made." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Hahn noted that the other Kenneth Hahn was his honorary campaign 
chairman. "I called Supervisor Hahn today," he said. "He told me, 'I've sure 
been pulling for you.' " Cerrell, however, commented simply, "The Hahn name is 
still a good name," and Joe Scott, a consultant to the fourth-ranking candidate 
in the voting, former Assessor John J. Lynch, declared, "Although every paper 
said this was not the same Kenny Hahn, the name was still there in the voters' 
minds." 
</P>
<P>
 Both winners Wednesday were already looking forward to their next four years, 
with Hahn vowing to continue to fairly re-evaluate properties that have lost 
taxable value due to the real estate downturn, and Block saying he would remain 
dedicated to the Sheriff's Department doing the best it can with limited fiscal 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Block, who has tried to develop a more ethnically diverse department, marked 
his victory by appointing three new sheriff's captains, one white, one black 
and one Latino.

 This is one NBA finals when the crowds should be pleading, "Off-ense, 
Off-ense. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 A million excuses were given for the lousy marksmanship in the last quarter 
Wednesday night, but we've been seeing this kind of thing in the NBA all 
season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It figures to be a history-making night at Madison Square Garden. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If the heavily favored New York Rangers beat the Vancouver Canucks and win 
their first Stanley Cup since 1940, the first American winner of the Conn 
Smythe Trophy will be named. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Ranger defenseman Brian Leetch is the runaway leading candidate for the award 
that goes to the most valuable player in the NHL playoffs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Second choice might be Leetch's teammate on the 1988 U.S. Olympic team, Ranger 
goaltender Mike Richter. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the presence of Leetch and Richter, the United States didn't win a 
medal at Calgary. . . .

 The Coliseum press box might have to be demolished because of the earthquake 
damage. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Makeshift accommodations in the stands will be used by sportswriters if 
football is played at the Coliseum this season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The working stiffs sat outside during the 1984 Olympic Games while VIPs 
watched from the press box, and the same thing will happen at World Cup venues, 
including the Rose Bowl. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Sigi Schmid, U.S. World Cup team assistant coach, says: "If I had to pay to 
watch any player, it would be Carlos Valderrama of Colombia. He could dribble 
through and around six guys in a telephone booth."... 
</P>
<P>
 Schmid, who has coached UCLA to two national titles, points out: "Soccer is a 
game of turnovers, and the teams that make the quickest transitions from 
offense to defense and vice versa are the most successful." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Among the differences between soccer and hockey is that a penalty shot is 
practically a gimme in the World Cup, but none has ever been made in a Stanley 
Cup finals game. During his attempt Tuesday night at Vancouver, Pavel Bure made 
a neat move on Richter but was stopped. . . . 
</P>

<P>
 I wonder how big a lead the Dodgers would have in the National League West if 
they hadn't traded Pedro Martinez to the Montreal Expos for Delino DeShields. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was the best middle-inning relief pitcher in the league last year. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields, the second baseman who replaced Jody Reed, has been the victim of 
rotten luck and was just starting to contribute when he was put on the disabled 
list again because of a finger injury. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers might get 10 years of good service out of DeShields, who is only 
25. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But today they are in dire need of instant relief. . . .

 Look for Brocco to get out of the gate in good order, unlike in the Kentucky 
Derby, and win the Belmont Stakes. . . .

 The USA Network made a big deal about Orlando Canizales tying Manuel Ortiz's 
record of 15 successful bantamweight championship defenses Tuesday night. The 
difference is that Canizales holds only the IBF title and Ortiz, one of the 
greatest 118-pound fighters ever, was undisputed champion in 1942-46. . . .

THOROUGHBRED RACING / BILL CHRISTINE; STRODES CREEK HAS THE LOOK OF A FAVORITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At Belmont Park's Barn 1, trainer Charlie Whittingham peered through the 
webbing that served as a front door for Strodes Creek's stall. The big, dark 
brown colt was stretched out diagonally on a bed of straw, taking an 
early-morning nap despite the hubbub along shed row. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at him," Whittingham said approvingly. "Nothing worries him. There's not 
a nerve in his body." 
</P>
<P>
 At almost 8-1 in the Kentucky Derby, Strodes Creek was a shorter price than he 
had a right to be. He had run in only one stake, finishing third behind Brocco 
and Tabasco Cat in the Santa Anita Derby. Neither of his two victories was at a 
distance beyond a mile. At Churchill Downs, they were betting on Whittingham 
more than the horse, and the Hall of Fame trainer almost won his third Derby 
when Strodes Creek finished second, two lengths behind Go For Gin. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, for the 126th running of the Belmont Stakes on Saturday, Strodes Creek 
may be overbet again. In a preliminary line published by Roxy Roxborough, the 
Las Vegas oddsmaker, Strodes Creek, still without a stakes victory, is the 2-1 
favorite, followed by Brocco and Go For Gin, each at 5-2, and Preakness winner 
Tabasco Cat at 4-1. The other probable starters -- Amathos, Signal Tap and 
Ulises -- will go off at much higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the early odds surprised him, Go For Gin's trainer, Nick Zito, said: 
"Yes and no. Maybe Strodes Creek's getting all the support because Charlie has 
told some people that he's got the Belmont in his back pocket." 
</P>
<P>
 Whittingham is neither surprised nor apologetic about being the possible 
Belmont favorite. The only times he has run in the Belmont, he came with 
Kentucky Derby winners, and both were beaten at short prices. Ferdinand, the 
second choice, ran third on a sloppy track in 1986, and Sunday Silence, who 
could have had a $5-million payday with a victory and a Triple Crown sweep in 
1989, was 9-10 when he finished second, eight lengths behind Easy Goer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This track (the 1 1/2-mile Belmont Park, which is the same circumference as 
the distance of the race) is perfect for Strodes Creek," Whittingham said. 
"It's got sweeping turns, the kind that are made to order for a big-striding 
horse like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Strodes Creek was withheld from the 1 3/16-mile Preakness, second leg of the 
Triple Crown. His stablemate, Numerous, finished fifth after a terrible start 
from the outside post at Pimlico. Whittingham will run Numerous in the $100,000 
Colin, a 1 1/8-mile race for 3-year-olds on Saturday's Belmont card. 
</P>
<P>
 "Numerous has already run his 1 1/2-mile race," Whittingham cracked. "After 
that start, that's what it took for him to get around the track at Pimlico. I 
probably would have run Strodes Creek there, too, if the bonus was still at 
stake. It's just as well that I didn't. He's had a lot of races this year, and 
he really didn't become a 3-year-old until after the Derby." 
</P>
<P>
 Horses automatically gain a year on Jan. 1, but Strodes Creek was foaled on 
May 17, 1991.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite losing to Easy Goer in the Belmont, Sunday Silence scored enough bonus 
points in the Derby and Preakness to earn an extra $1 million in 1989. The 
Chrysler Corp. dropped the bonus after last year, retaining the $5-million 
guarantee for a Triple Crown sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 Strodes Creek races for the three-way partnership of Whittingham, Arthur B. 
Hancock III and Robert and Janice McNair. Hancock, who owns the dam, Bottle 
Top, received a full brother to Strodes Creek about a month ago when she foaled 
a colt who was also sired by Halo. 
</P>
<P>
 Strodes Creek was not among the many horses that broke badly in the Kentucky 
Derby, but he ran into trouble on the first turn. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was going to be in good position but got shuffled back," Whittingham said. 
"That left him with an extra five lengths that he had to make up." 
</P>
<P>
 Strodes Creek gave Whittingham a scare Sunday morning at Belmont. After a 
two-mile gallop, his regular exercise rider, Sonia Simmons, sensed that he took 
a bad step, and jumped off instead of riding him back to the barn. Strodes 
Creek was returned in a horse ambulance, but extensive X-rays showed no 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The horse was perfectly sound the next day," Simmons said. "I think he 
bothered his testicle during the gallop. I thought that he might have hit 
himself or fractured one of his legs, and that's why I jumped off, to see what 
happened. It seemed very bizarre, but it's the only conclusion we can come to. 
He galloped a mile Monday morning, and he did it perfectly. It was just one of 
those freak accidents." 
</P>
<P>
 Like A.P. Indy, who won the Belmont and was voted horse of the year in 1992, 
Strodes Creek had one testicle surgically removed. The operation normally 
doesn't prevent a horse from becoming a breeder. 
</P>
<P>
 The Strodes Creek incident Sunday capped an eventful weekend for the 
81-year-old Whittingham, who was taken to a nearby hospital Friday morning 
after complaining of stomach pains. He was released after a series of tests 
were taken. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I ate some chicken that didn't agree with me," Whittingham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently the problem was unrelated to a hospital visit that Whittingham made 
in Louisville, a week before the Derby. The diagnosis that time was an impacted 
bowel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm all right," Whittingham said Wednesday. "I'd rather be here with a bad 
stomach than a bad horse." 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Chris McCarron, who will ride Go For Gin in the Belmont Stakes, has the mount 
on Numerous in the Colin. McCarron rode Numerous to victory in the Kentucky 
Derby Trial. . . . With Jerry Bailey riding Strodes Creek, Craig Perret has 
picked up the mount on Ulises. . . . Tabasco Cat was the last Belmont horse to 
arrive in New York. He had been training at Churchill Downs since winning the 
Preakness. . . . Trainer Charlie Whittingham plans to be at Hollywood Park on 
Sunday to saddle double Eclipse Award winner Flawlessly in the Gamely Handicap. 
. . . Scattered thunderstorms are in the forecast for Friday, and there's also 
a chance of rain Saturday. Go For Gin, who won the Kentucky Derby in the slop, 
has three victories and two seconds in five starts on off tracks.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; GAMELY HANDICAP FEATURES TWO ECLIPSE AWARD FILLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Eclipse Award winners Flawlessly and Hollywood Wildcat could get together for 
the first time in the $150,000 Gamely Handicap on Sunday at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Idle since finishing third in the La Canada Stakes on Feb. 5, Hollywood 
Wildcat is considered possible for the Gamely, which is run at 1 1/8 miles on 
the turf.After being scratched out of the Hawthorne Handicap on May 29 when she 
came down with a slight cough, the daughter of Kris S., who won the Eclipse as 
the nation's top 3-year-old filly in 1993, worked seven furlongs on the turf in 
1:27 4/5 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Flawlessly, unbeaten in six starts on the Hollywood Park turf course, was 
assigned 124 pounds, two more than Hollywood Wildcat, for her first race in 
more than seven months. She worked five furlongs on the grass in 1:01. The 
6-year-old daughter of Affirmed won her second consecutive Eclipse Award as the 
nation's top female grass performer last year. BOB MIESZERSKI

LOS ALAMITOS; SPOTLIGHT FOCUSES ON 2-YEAR-OLDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODY BERGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first round of futurity trials, Dicey Secret and Dash Of Cider stepped 
up as the 2-year-old filly and colt to watch. Then the filly lost and now the 
colt is going to New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 But another promising 2-year-old is sure to appear in the Kindergarten 
Futurity trials this weekend. Even without dominant contenders in either the 
colt or filly division, trainers agree there is one out there -- a 2-year-old 
waiting to stand out. 
</P>
<P>
 Colts will compete Friday night for 10 spots in the $100,000 Kindergarten 
Futurity, a Grade II event scheduled June 24. The $100,000 Miss Kindergarten 
Futurity, also a Grade II event, will be run June 25, with trials Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dash Of Cider, the California Sires Cup Futurity winner, will skip this 
month's race and the next couple of rounds in California in favor of the 
All-American Futurity at Ruidoso Downs in Ruidoso, N.M. A Grade I, 400-yard 
test, the All-American is run on Labor Day weekend with trials two weeks 
earlier.  
</P>
<P>
 "We probably won't run here before then because the next trials (for the 
Governor's Cup) are in late July and that's too close to the All-American 
trials," trainer Brian Koriner said. "We'll train him up to the race." 
</P>
<P>
 Koriner will start Chenilles Dasher and Too Too Twain in the Kindergarten 
trials. Like Dash Of Cider, both are owned by Gordon Shultz. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy Monji's Dicey Secret, the fastest qualifier for the California Sires Cup 
Futurity, was bumped from either side in the first 100 yards of that race and 
finished third. The experience left her a little body-sore, and trainer Danny 
Mitchell was not sure she would start this weekend. But on recent mornings, the 
filly dispelled any concern.  
</P>
<P>
 "Oh yeah, she's bucking and playing," Mitchell said.  
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell is also starting Mighty Fancy Pass, a filly he trains for William 
Peeples. Mighty Fancy Pass ran third in a futurity in Utah and is eligible for 
the Ed Burke Memorial and the Breeders futurities later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a nice bunch of babies this year," Mitchell said. "I've seen a few 
and I'm sure we'll see some more. They'll start coming out of the woodwork 
pretty soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Conventional wisdom on the backstretch points to trainer Daryn Charlton as the 
man with the best 2-year-olds. He will start Dollars Chick and Outlasting in 
the Miss Kindergarten for owner Spencer Childers. Jungle Raised, who completed 
the three Childers-owned, Charlton-trained fillies, missed too much training 
because of a persistent fever. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fling King and Hi Tech Attack from the Jaime Gomez barn and the Dennis 
Givens-trained My Left Foot could serve notice in the colt division. Although 
Givens is hesitant to tout his own runners, he acknowledged that the colt was 
impressive in his first outing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a little trouble, grabbed himself leaving the gate and he still won by 
a length," Givens said, adding that he would have liked more time to bring the 
colt up to the Kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainers entered 18 colts in the Kindergarten trials, and more than 20 are 
likely for the filly division. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have Caits Dash and Merri Beduino in the filly half," trainer Dennis Ekins 
said. "They're both nice fillies, but they haven't shown a great deal." 
</P>
<P>
 A 22-year veteran of the quarter horse circuit, Ekins thought this might be a 
light crop of 2-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen a lot of really good 2-year-olds," he said. "I've seen a lot 
of good ones with respectable times but nothing outstanding. It's early, 
though, and there's still a lot of 2-year-olds that haven't had any races. 
Hopefully we have one waiting in the wings." 
</P>
<P>
 Connie Hall, who has four futurity hopefuls, agreed. "There hasn't been any 
horse that looks like a great horse, but we've only had one futurity," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall, who was recently awarded the lifetime achievement award by the Women 
Behind Racing, will start Yuubasan in the colt's division and Ruby Red 
Corvette, Ms Dash Fascination and She's a Chic Kid in the filly trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Although trainers expect a 2-year-old to jump up this weekend, racing 
secretary Ron Church doubts it. He said talent is more evenly spread out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're running these trials later this year, and still there isn't one 
outstanding 2-year-old as there has been in years past," Church said. "It's 
better for the owners, and I think we'll get more competitive races this way." 
</P>

 At 33-1, Streakin Dunes surprised almost everyone by winning the $20,000 James 
Smith Memorial Handicap -- including his trainer, Charles Treece. 
</P>
<P>
 Treece also saddled Mr. Diddy Wa Diddy, the 3-5 favorite in the 870-yard race. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't break as sharp as he usually does," Treece said of Mr. Diddy Wa 
Diddy. "The (No.) 7 horse kind of bumped him on the right side." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewards thought Trucklin Six, who broke from the fourth post and finished the 
race second, also did some bumping. They disqualified the Connie Hall-trained 
colt, moving him to last, and elevated third-place Mr. Diddy Wa Diddy into 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 "Streakin Dunes has been training great. He came up to the race a winner," 
Treece said, referring to the gelding's last victory over $8,000 claimers. "But 
we had never run him in anything that tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Jockey Oscar Monroy picked up his first stakes victory in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could hear them coming as we got close to the wire, and all I could think 
of was to keep riding Streakin Dunes well past the wire," Monroy said.

 Although "Doonesbury" creator Garry Trudeau refers to the Catholic church as 
blessing same-sex unions, most, but not all, of the claims of such unions point 
to rituals and practices of Catholics who later came to be identified with the 
Eastern Orthodox Church. Church spokesmen dispute the claims made in a book by 
Yale University professor John Boswell.

FASHION / INSIDE OUT: BY DESIGN; TWO FIRSTS: ONE BY KLEIN, ONE FOR BEENE

<P>
 You're nobody till somebody sells it to you wholesale. That was made painfully 
clear to us this week when we heard that Calvin Klein's fall-winter collection 
was being shown to tout le Hollywood -- not in a store (that happens at Neiman 
Marcus later this month), but in a private suite at the Regent Beverly Wilshire 
Hotel. What's more, said our source, the merchandise was being sold at cost. 
</P>
<P>
 But when we tried to invite ourself to the party, guess what? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid all of the appointments are booked up," said Elizabeth Rogers, 
Klein's West Coast public relations rep and Hollywood liaison, reached Tuesday 
by phone at the hotel. Sure, designers have their favorite clients, but even 
those familiar with the fashion world's courtship of Hollywood deemed this 
arrangement unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
 One insider speculated that the move was an attempt "to build a customer base" 
before Calvin Klein's Rodeo Drive boutique opens for business at a not-yet 
disclosed date. Still another was sure that the extra-early preview of the fall 
collection would irritate the Wilshire Boulevard retailers -- such as Saks 
Fifth Avenue, I. Magnin, Barneys New York and Neiman Marcus -- that carry the 
Klein line. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at Neiman Marcus' Dallas buying offices could not be reached for 
comment, but Beverly Morgan, spokeswoman for the Beverly Hills store, said she 
hadn't heard about the Klein sale. "I'm sure we're fine with it," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers said the collection had never been sold in this manner. "What it is, 
basically," she stammered, "is a preview. We're showing it privately, before it 
hits the trunk-show circuit, to celebrities who like to wear Calvin Klein and 
those we'd like to wear Calvin Klein." 
</P>
<P>
 Meg Ryan, Anjelica Huston, Patricia Arquette, Goldie Hawn and Natalie Cole had 
already stopped by, she said. So, apparently, had assorted studio execs and 
high-powered agents. All of whom know a deal when they see one. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers bristled, however, when asked about the deep discount -- typically 
offered only when the season has ended. "This is a private event -- it's not to 
be written about. We'd rather not comment about what's going on here." 
</P>
<P>
 His Excellence: A New York designer who actually likes L.A.? Geoffrey Beene, 
in town this week to accept the LACMA Costume Council's first Award of 
Excellence, has even named his next collection "Santa Monica." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting at a shady table on the balcony of the museum's Bing Theater, where 
his fall collection was shown Monday, Beene reminisced about the glamorous 
turban-wearing aunt he visited in Los Angeles each summer, starting at age 14. 
He refreshed some of those memories over the weekend, he said, with a stroll 
through Santa Monica. "My aunt would wear short-sleeved blouses, printed pants 
and high, cork wedgies" -- a look he's incorporating for next spring's 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
 "My clothes are never retro," Beene said, "but good things are never retro." 
Nor will the spring collection contain anything too fragile. Think of two of 
Beene's best-known clients, Glenn Close and Paloma Picasso, and you get the 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
 A Marriage of Convenience: From now on, the marketing, selling and development 
of Fred Hayman Beverly Hills Fragrance Collections will be in the hands of Ilia 
Lekach, chairman and CEO of Pompano, Fla.-based Parlux Fragrances Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very hard for a small company to sell to department stores these days," 
Lekach said this week. By merging Parlux, which sells Vicky Tiel, Animale 
Parfums and Todd Oldham (due in March), with Fred Hayman Fragrances (273 and 
Touch), Lekach has nearly doubled Parlux's worldwide wholesale volume to more 
than $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
 By licensing his name, Hayman becomes a major shareholder in Parlux. It's an 
arrangement that makes both parties fairly giddy with excitement. "I did an 
analysis of the company," Lekach said, "then I went courting. It's a perfect 
marriage." For his part, Hayman said he's happy to let Parlux expand 
international sales while he concentrates on his Beverly Hills boutique. 
</P>
<P>
 Wish List: We can only hope that when Bloomingdale's hits Beverly Hills -- 
rumor has it, on the parking lot next to R.J.'s on Beverly Drive, north of 
Wilshire Boulevard -- our dreams of a Fantasy Department Store will come true. 
At our FDS (an unfortunate acronym), we'd never have to wait 15 minutes for a 
clerk to retrieve a pair of Size 8 shoes, only to be presented with a Size 8 
1/2. At our FDS, we would never have to listen to salesclerks discuss tedious 
luncheon plans before tallying our purchases. At our FDS, we wouldn't have to 
squat in a dimly lit corner to hunt for the right size kids' tights while 
salesclerks argue about whose turn it is for a break. It's the customer's turn 
for a break, OK? There, we feel better now. 
</P>
<P>
 Blinded by the Light: Forget bonding. Forget teeth whiteners. We hear the best 
way to make your smile seem brighter is to make your gums redder. It sounds 
gruesome, but a local beauty swears by a dentifrice rouge called Email Diamant. 
She asks anyone going to France to bring it back for her, or she orders it for 
$10 from Boyd's cosmetics in New York City. Anything for beauty . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Lunchables: Surprise visitor at the New Yorker's soiree at Bistro Garden in 
honor of Fragrance Week, hosted by West Coast editor Caroline Graham, was Sen. 
Alfonse D'Amato (R-N.Y.), who -- despite being the subject of the magazine's 
criticism -- was charming to one and all . . . Rome-based jeweler Bulgari 
introduced its new Chandra collection of white porcelain with 18-karat gold 
jewelry at the Bel-Air Hotel, leaving us to ponder whether to buy the $500 ring 
or the $23,000 necklace . . . We hear that Mr. Inside Out's favorite "Mod 
Squad"-er, Peggy Lipton, is the possible replacement for Isabella Rossellini at 
Lancome.

 Just because Donna Karan, Giorgio Armani, Dolce & Gabbana and Dries Van Noten 
have included skirts in their menswear collections doesn't mean your ordinary 
Joe will ever wear one. But who wants to be ordinary? Uh, nobody at the 
Temple's second annual Skirt Party and fashion show Saturday night.A pink tutu 
worn with pearls and a biker jacket didn't even rate a second glance at this 
event, held at the West L.A. spot once occupied by Wolfgang Puck's now-defunct 
brew pub, Eureka. 
</P>
<P>
 Men in skating skirts, sarongs and kilts crowded around the runway for the 11 
p.m. show, while in an impromptu dressing room, wrap skirts were re-wrapped and 
silk rope belts retied. Surrounded by scantily clad male models, a woman 
whispered loudly to a friend: "I gave up Barbra Streisand tickets to be here." 
</P>
<P>
 The difference between men's and women's skirts boils down to one word: " Hips 
!" said designer Dean Harris -- or the lack of them. John Bartlett solved the 
no-hips, no-waist problem by leaving his thrift-shop patchwork granny skirt 
completely unzipped for the night. "This is like something I always wanted to 
wear in high school but couldn't," he said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 We asked one towering guy from New Zealand, who wore a wool wrap skirt, where 
he draws the line, skirt-wise. "That," he sneered, motioning to a fellow in a 
fringed rayon mini. "You don't want to look like a bad Tonya Harding." DEBRA

 If you'd prefer not to scrutinize those warmly mystical feelings of deja vu 
and "eyes at the back of your head," or if you're disinclined to question the 
holy visions that strike others, then read no further. 
</P>
<P>
 For the "Neil" of this book's title is an epileptic, and in explaining the 
nature of his seizures, neurophysiologist William Calvin and neurosurgeon 
George Ojemann ride roughshod over the sensations that we traditionally hold up 
as evidence of our special link with the sacred. 
</P>
<P>
 Those eyes at the back of our head, they tell us, are really just the "truly 
egocentric" neurons in Area 7 of the brain's parietal lobe, which 
subconsciously decipher signals sent from the optic nerve to detect objects 
moving in the space just beyond our skin. 
</P>
<P>
 And that vision Paul had on the road to Damascus, they contend, was likely 
brought on by an epileptic seizure, the same electrical brain storm that may 
precede deja vu. Similarly, they reason, the voices that told Joan of Arc to 
save France may well have been auditory hallucinations with temporal lobe 
seizures brought on by tuberculosis, a disease that would explain the reason 
(calcific pericarditis) Joan of Arc's heart refused to burn at the stake. 
</P>
<P>
 These explanations, appearing to invest our most sacred stories with all the 
artistic grandeur of a TV repair manual, may type the authors as rather 
unromantic and unspiritual souls. But Calvin, whose voice narrates this text 
(Ojemann serves as a sort of technical consultant), is in fact a "spiritual 
secularist," a would-be Buddha with a mission for showing that science can 
evoke just as much wonder and instill just as much purpose as religion. 
</P>
<P>
 In his ambitious and successful "The River That Flows Uphill" (Macmillan, 
1987), for instance, Calvin took his readers on a rafting trip in the Grand 
Canyon. While tossing rocks on a beach, he showed how the need for hand-eye 
coordination helped our brains develop; while gazing up at the stars, he 
explained how snow on the TV screen offers evidence of the Big Bang. 
</P>
<P>
 The fields for this outing -- a hospital where part of Neil's temporal lobe 
will be lopped off to cure his epilepsy -- are considerably less Elysian. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvin, nevertheless, does his best to evoke the scenery ("Neil and I had the 
round table to ourselves, amid the smell of fresh coffee and the sound of rain 
on the glass roof") and his literary device ("Neil" is a composite of many 
patients) occasions great dialogue. After the operation, for instance, a 
baseball-capped Neil greets his two doctors: 
</P>
<P>
 Neil: "Well, I guess I gave you a piece of my mind!" 
</P>
<P>
 Calvin (groaning): "No, only a piece of brain. Anatomy. The mind is the brain 
in action, its physiology. Mind is like what the computer produces, rather than 
the computer itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Neil: "Now, if it were my computer, knocking out a piece of it would cause it 
to crash. And it could never reboot itself. . . . I think the analogy you want 
is not a computer, but rather a computer network. One that can share work among 
the idle processors. You ought to figure out how the brain can reorganize 
itself . . . then patent it quickly, before a computer designer does!" 
</P>
<P>
 Ojemann: "Except for the little problem that we don't know enough about how 
the brain works." 
</P>
<P>
 Calvin: "The usual hyperbole, even repeated by the New York Times in a 
headline, is that the principles they use are 'based on the human brain' . . . 
. Which is a gross overstatement. . . . A more appropriate headline, 
considering the current state of the art, would have been 'based on slug 
nerves.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Calvin's decision to organize this book around an operation to cure epilepsy 
does have a big drawback: Such an operation must focus on charting speech and 
thought areas so as not to excise them along with diseased brain tissue. The 
brain, however, is such a Byzantine brier of neurons that not even a 
cartographer as skilled as Calvin can offer a map that lay people can decipher. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus the best parts of this book are the more philosophical ones, wherein 
Calvin concedes that human thought is best understood as "a process, not a 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 Calvin is too modest to reveal that the theory currently favored for 
explaining that process -- neural Darwinism -- is one that he helped fashion. 
Nevertheless, he explains the process lucidly as a kind of game in which our 
subconscious chooses among competing networks of neurons -- each one offering 
its own way of interpreting perceptions by summoning up specific memories. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning "neural network" gets to weave our story for the day -- a story we 
call "consciousness."

<P>
 The Colorado Street Bridge that spans the Arroyo Seco in Pasadena has had its 
ups and downs over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 At best it's been a majestic monument to a city proud of its past -- citizens 
fought to preserve it even when the 210 Freeway built next to it would 
presumably make it obsolete.At worst -- well, let's just say some locals are 
still wont to refer to it as "Suicide Bridge."  
</P>
<P>
 Whatever its name, one thing is certain: that it's looking as impressive as 
ever after a recently completed reconstruction. It will be closed to cars again 
on Saturday -- but this time, it's to make way for a celebration, welcoming the 
landmark back to its stately self. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena Heritage will host an evening of live music, featuring such 
performers as the jazz group Nairobi Trio, Black Dot Troopers (African hip-hop) 
and Pat Lubow with the blues. Scottish fiddlers and Aztec dancers will also 
entertain, along with Frank Jordan's Compact Big Band, Snotty Scotty & the 
Hankies playing 1950s and '60s music, and the Friendship Baptist Gospel Choir. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1909 fire engine and vintage cars and bicycles will be on display for 
nostalgia's sake. Numerous Pasadena restaurants will provide food, including 
Abiento, Green Street, Mijares, Pie and Burger, and Crown City Brewery.  
</P>
<P>
 The event takes place from 6-11 p.m. Tickets are $12.50 in advance; $15 at the 
gate. For information, call Pasadena Heritage at (818) 793-0189. LAURIE K.

O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW / MIKE BOEHM; REVIVED TRAFFIC: NOT FAR FROM HOME AFTER 
ALL; THE BAND'S ABILITY AND ITS ENGAGEMENT WITH THE MUSIC MAKE A COMEBACK 
JUSTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was no great sense of occasion, no buzz of anticipation as the reunited 
Traffic arrived at The Pond of Anaheim Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no great thematic subtext to lend fresh meaning to songs from more 
than 20 years ago: Traffic was always more about jams and tunes than lyrical 
ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 There wasn't any essential new material to play, the revived band's "Far From 
Home" album having a lot more in common with the tired ramblings of Steve 
Winwood's last two solo releases than with the adventurous spark of Traffic's 
prime years in the late '60s and early '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 There wasn't even a close-to-capacity crowd, which perhaps was inevitable for 
a classic-rock band arriving a few days after the Eagles had finished sucking 
something on the order of $8 million to $9 million in concert grosses out of 
the Southern California market. 
</P>
<P>
 But the youthful-looking Winwood, his worn and craggy old sidekick Jim Capaldi 
and their four supporting recruits managed to make a convincing case in favor 
of Traffic's rekindled existence. Their collective argument was simple and 
straightforward: good singin', good playin', good energy, good songs. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience didn't begin to stand and roar with approval until halfway 
through the two-hour show, when "Empty Pages" launched a closing string of some 
of the band's best-loved nuggets. But the vital signs were strong from the 
opening numbers, "Pearly Queen" and "Medicated Goo," two '60-vintage songs that 
found Traffic playing both bluesy and funky, showing a sharp group cohesion but 
also enough of a limber quality to free the show from the dull neatness of the 
"Far From Home" album (not to mention the live snooze-athon that was Winwood's 
show at the Pacific Amphitheatre three years ago). 
</P>
<P>
 The new album was acknowledged but not belabored. Early on, Traffic played 
three of the stronger songs in succession: the bluesy "Here Comes A Man," the 
funky "Some Kinda Woman" (with its echoes of Winwood's leading mentor, Ray 
Charles -- who plays in Costa Mesa tonight) and "Every Night, Every Day," a 
slight but serviceably bopping take on the Memphis soul sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Questionable selections bogged Traffic down during the middle of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Winwood's splendid, cleanly etched guitar playing partly redeemed the 
slogging, self-descriptive plaint "(Sometimes I Feel So) Uninspired" (the only 
song taken from "Shoot Out at the Fantasy Factory," the album that began 
Traffic's decline in 1973. The band's farewell album from 1974, "When the Eagle 
Flies," was skipped altogether in a set that drew seven of its 13 oldies from 
the early '70s albums "Low Spark of High-Heeled Boys" and "John Barleycorn Must 
Die," and only one or two songs each from the band's first three releases). 
</P>
<P>
 "Nowhere Is There Freedom," the fourth (and least, and thankfully last) new 
selection, and "Forty Thousand Headmen" -- dedicated to Chris Wood, the Traffic 
sax and flute player who died in 1983 -- finished the too-long stretch of 
placid songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Those choices were especially questionable given that Traffic left out such 
vibrant songs as "Heaven Is in Your Mind" and "Coloured Rain," two brilliant 
examples of '60s psychedelic rock wrought with pure-pop buoyancy, rather than 
with the genre's more typical druggy droning. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, Traffic scored on the strength of a fine catalogue and excellent 
all-around musicianship. Winwood may not be "pound for pound the best musician 
on the planet," which is how Capaldi introduced him. But it's hard to think of 
a rock musician who can surpass his combined abilities as a singer, a guitarist 
and a piano and organ player. 
</P>
<P>
 Each facet was given its due. Vocally, his instantly soulful voice has lost 
nothing. As a guitarist, he shares the firm blues grounding, good taste, and 
tonal presence of Eric Clapton, his once-upon-a-time band mate in Blind Faith. 
His piano workouts on "Empty Pages," "Low Spark of High-Heeled Boys" and "Glad" 
were inventive improvisations that didn't merely replay the old-familiar parts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Capaldi and Walfredo Reyes traded off between trap drum and conga percussion 
slots; along with bassist Rosko Gee, they kept the rhythm churning and 
percolating nicely. (Capaldi also stepped out front to give good, gruff-voiced 
renditions of "Rock & Roll Stew" and "Light Up or Leave Me Alone," the two 
earthy rockers he sang on the "Low Spark" album). Randall Bramblett did a close 
Chris Wood impersonation with distorted saxophone solos and fluttering, 
piercing flute sallies. 
</P>
<P>
 The show involved little chatter and less stagecraft, but neither was greatly 
missed. Winwood, never a flamboyant showman, left what few announcements needed 
to be made to Capaldi (among them: the song dedication to the late Wood and, 
near the end of the show, "thanks for waiting 20 years"). Slides of minimalist 
paintings and the inevitable psychedelic sloshing and swirling of colors were 
projected on a screen behind the band. 
</P>
<P>
 The playing was the thing, and it was enough. It yielded such peak moments as 
a truly explosive "Dear Mr. Fantasy" in which Winwood's probing, cutting guitar 
lines and impassioned singing set a standard of achievement for returning 
rockers trying to recapture a spark. Also notable was the driving conclusion to 
"Freedom Rider," in which the band courted chaos (again, that defeating 
fastidiousness was flung far out the window). 
</P>
<P>
 The only song not originally done by Traffic was the stomping show closer, 
"Gimme Some Lovin'." This barn-burner from Winwood's first prominent band, the 
Spencer Davis Group, rolled along on new rhythmic tracks that were part Bo 
Diddley hambone beat, part Latin groove, and part country train-rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Allman Brothers Band in its strong '90s stage comeback, Traffic was 
worth hearing even without new material that could match its most glorious 
past. Entering the show with two strikes against it, Traffic scored a hit with 
its ability and its engagement with the music. In the end, even a skeptic had 
to agree that a line from the show-closing refrain could sum up the live aspect 
of the group's 20-year reunion: So glad you made it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The opening act was Sonia Dada, a group from Chicago that issued its debut 
album in 1992 but is trying to start over now that its label, Chameleon 
Records, is kaput. 
</P>
<P>
 The oddly named R&B band resembles that other even more oddly named Midwestern 
R&B-rock band Was (Not Was). Both have gifted, harmonizing soul singers out 
front, but Sonia Dada lacks the quirky vision of the Was band, and its 
instrumental backup often was heavy-handed, long on routinely shrieking, 
note-shredding blues-rock guitar solos. 
</P>
<P>
 The band clicked when the players got out of the way and performed with 
efficient restraint, leaving the spotlight on Michael Scott, who brought a 
piercing, almost otherworldly tenor wail to the concluding "Jungle Song," and 
Paris Deland, who contributed the kind of deep, resonant bass singing that 
Melvin Franklin made famous in the Temptations, and sang smooth falsetto 
backups. Sam Hogan, an effective rasper, completed the promising vocal front 
line.

WESTSIDE WATCH: LIMITS ON BOARDWALK STALLS SPUR A GRASS-ROOTS PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 15 years, Jack Herer has been telling anyone who will listen that hemp is 
"the most important thing in the world. . . . Sails, flags, maps, newspapers -- 
they're all made from hemp, which is the same thing as marijuana." 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows? Maybe there is even a little ganja in the paper used to produce a 
new plan that limits the spaces and operating hours of groups such as Herer's 
-- HEMP, or Help End Marijuana Prohibition -- that set up their shops on the 
Venice boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a pilot project approved by the Los Angeles Department of Recreation and 
Parks, booths along Oceanfront Walk will be subject to a variety of 
restrictions -- among them, that they can be no longer than six feet. Officials 
contend that the booths are getting so big that they block emergency traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 That burns Herer, whose, uh, grass-roots organization hands out literature and 
merchandise every day from a table on the boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're just trying to upscale (the beach)," Herer said. "It's the last place 
I know of in Los Angeles where people can take their families and walk in a 
parade atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 "Naturally, everyone in the community is very upset about this," said Jerry 
Rubin, whose Los Angeles Alliance for Survival, a nonprofit peace group, also 
hands out literature. "It's unfair, unnecessary and restrictive. It destroys 
the free spirit of Venice Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Niki Tennant, an aide to Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, said the pilot program, 
which began May 30, will continue through September. City park rangers will 
first warn violators, then start ticketing later in the summer, she said. The 
City Council may make the program permanent. 
</P>

 TALKING TRASH: No, the "D" in D-day does not stand for Dumpster.  
</P>
<P>
 Someone should tell that to the trash haulers who stormed a West Hollywood 
City Council meeting Monday on the 50th anniversary of the Normandy invasion. 
Waving miniature American flags and invoking everyone from Thomas Jefferson to 
Henry Kissinger, haulers and their supporters protested a plan to have one 
company collect all trash in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 That would cut truck traffic and help coordinate recycling efforts, the city 
contends. But it also could mean lost business for the more than 15 other 
haulers serving many apartments and businesses, plus higher prices for a third 
of city residents and businesses.  
</P>
<P>
 Full of D-day fervor, opponents cast the plan as an unpatriotic assault on 
Americans' fundamental right to choose . . . their own trash hauler. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal would create a "legal monopoly that goes against the American 
way," said attorney Tim Agajanian, representing a haulers group. "That's not 
what we fought D-day for." 
</P>
<P>
 Unmoved, the council approved the idea. Angry opponents vowed to take their 
offensive to a second front: the city voters. Two separate challenges may show 
up on the local ballot this fall. It could be a lively little Dumpster war.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: RANCHO PALOS VERDES WANTS THE POSTAL SERVICE TO ZAP THIS 
ZIP IDEA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 RETURN TO SENDER: Thanks to the TV show, 90210 may be the world's most famous 
ZIP code -- actually, it's the world's only famous ZIP code. But ZIP code 
status-consciousness is not confined to Beverly Hills. It has also spread to 
the Palos Verdes Peninsula, where some Rancho Palos Verdes denizens are none 
too pleased they'll soon be sharing numbers with "less desirable" places to 
live. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of what it calls a database overload, the U.S. Postal Service plans to 
divide street addresses on the peninsula into two ZIP codes, effective July 2. 
All Rancho Palos Verdes addresses will now come under a 90275 code, and 
addresses in the three other peninsula cities will keep the 90274 number. 
</P>
<P>
 But the change also means parts of San Pedro and Eastview, which lies adjacent 
to Rancho Palos Verdes, will get the 90275 code, leading one resident to 
protest he feels he's being "ghettoized into a less desirable ZIP code." 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the local postmaster, W. E. Ballard complains: "I have nothing 
against San Pedro . . . but I paid a significantly higher price to move to the 
'real' Rancho Palos Verdes. I deeply resent being separated out from the rest 
of the peninsula and having my ZIP code 'bused' to another area." 
</P>
<P>
 However, many Rancho Palos Verdes residents already share numbers with San 
Pedro and Lomita. The city uses 90732 (San Pedro) and 90717 (Lomita) as well as 
the 90274 ZIP. 
</P>
<P>
 Other residential concerns about the changes: the cost and inconvenience of 
having checkbooks and business cards reprinted, and the difficulty the Postal 
Service might have in getting used to its new delivery system. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, don't blame Rancho Palos Verdes city officials for the zippy 
changes. Assistant City Manager Pam Antil said that the city has been 
requesting the merger of the three ZIPs since the early 1980s, and the recent 
changes made by the Postal Service were entirely its own. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 STAMPING OUT CRIME: They can handle rain, sleet and snow -- just don't call 
them the Postal Posse. 
</P>
<P>
 Postal carriers were apparently peeved when they learned that an experimental 
program in Redondo Beach, in which two letter carriers are toting cellular 
phones to report crimes, was being called the Postal Posse. They've asked that 
the name be changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Postal Posse is catchy, it has a nice ring to it and you could probably do a 
miniseries around it, but we've called it 'carrier alert' for years," said Jim 
Goins, president of the local letter carriers union. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the name Postal Posse sends the wrong message. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes it sound like we're rounding up crooks," Goins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Goins said he received complaints from area letter carriers that the name pits 
the postal workers against criminals, putting the postal workers in potential 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to go tap someone on the shoulder and say: 'You're under 
arrest in the name of the Postal Posse,' " Goins said. "They might just attack 
the carrier." 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager William E. Kirchhoff said he would be happy to change the name. 
The program has been successful in its first month, he said, with the carriers 
making about five helpful calls to police. 
</P>
<P>

 SPECIAL DELIVERY: Not getting enough TV in your life? Stop by your friendly 
Torrance Main Post Office, where you are now able to watch TV while you're 
waiting in line. 
</P>
<P>
 No, you won't be able to watch a rerun of the entire "Shogun" miniseries, or a 
complete edition of "60 Minutes" -- even at the post office you wouldn't have 
enough time for that. But you will get a chance to watch some three-minute 
Postal Service infomercials on a variety of fascinating postal-related topics: 
dog bites and letter carriers, overnight mail services for Father's Day 
procrastinators, that hot new Christmas stamp -- the list goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 The Torrance Main Post Office at 2510 Monterey St. set up its infomercial TV 
screen about six weeks ago. Other branches will probably add the equipment as 
well, said postal spokesman Larry Dozier. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gotten some very postive responses from it so far," Dozier said. "It 
makes the time pass while you are in line." QUOTE OF THE WEEK 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt . . . not a part of the class, because we did not receive our 
diplomas. We felt, a little bit, outsiders." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Frank Endo, a Japanese American student who did not graduate from San Pedro 
High School in 1942 because he was taken to an internment camp during the war.

ELECTIONS; ALTADENA, SOUTH PASADENA VOTERS APPROVE LIBRARY TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an extraordinary double victory for library boosters at the ballot box, 
Altadena voters overwhelmingly supported a tax to bolster their library Tuesday 
as South Pasadena voters narrowly approved a similar measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Altadena tax proponents celebrated Tuesday night after their grass-roots 
campaign for a tax to keep the library's doors open seven days a week defied a 
statewide trend against measures by winning easy approval. 
</P>
<P>
 More than four of five Altadena residents who went to the polls voted for the 
tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess my 11-month-old son won't remember this night, but in years to come I 
will tell him how Altadena citizens came together to do this extraordinary 
thing," said Reynolds Cafferata, 27, chairman of the Save Our Altadena Library 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have a library that has been the center of the community for 
decades, like this one, it's easy to sell such a measure to people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In South Pasadena, tax proponents had to wait until the early hours of 
Wednesday morning to hear that they had mustered more than the two-thirds 
majority need to pass the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means the library is protected for five more years as a seven-day-a-week 
library. Boy, it felt like I'd graduated college again or gotten married when I 
got the news," said Jan Wetzel, 66, chairman of the Committee to Protect Our 
Library. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were sweating a bit when we trailed on the absentee votes, but we knew our 
big army of campaign volunteers walking the precincts and working the phones 
brought out the voters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The final count in South Pasadena was 68.7% for the tax and 31.3% opposed, 
with a voter turnout of 39%. In Altadena, 85.3% voted for the measure and 14.7% 
opposed it; 34.4% of the unincorporated area's voters cast ballots. Both 
measures needed a two-thirds majority, or 66.6%, to win. 
</P>
<P>
 The Altadena levy will draw an extra $29 a year from each homeowner, $20 from 
each apartment owner and $59 to $79 from each non-residential property. That 
will provide $430,000 to restore services to 1991 levels. 
</P>
<P>
 In South Pasadena, the library tax will raise $219,500 a year to maintain 
seven-days-a-week library service and a variety of programs. Homeowners will 
pay $29 to $48 a year based on the square footage of their houses, apartment 
owners will chip in $12 per unit and businesses will pay $24 to $96 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax had faced tough opposition from the South Pasadena Taxpayers Assn. 
because only property owners, not tenants, would pay it. 
</P>
<P>
 However, its leaders were conciliatory Wednesday. "The people have clearly 
spoken (that) they want this tax. That is how the system is supposed to work," 
said Tom Biesek, a leading association member. 
</P>
<P>
 Both communities' taxes stay in effect for five years and have exemptions for 
low-income homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaigns built support on the threat of severe cuts if voters rejected 
the measures. In South Pasadena, proponents spread the message that with a city 
budget shortfall the library would close three days a week, lay off part-time 
employees and cancel special children's programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In Altadena, librarian Bill Tema announced that the main library would close 
two of the six days it is now open and the branch library would be cut from 
five to two days. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents in both communities said the challenge was getting people to the 
polls because most residents were more than willing to give moral and vocal 
support.

LEGISLATURE; PRIMARIES SET STAGE FOR TWO ELECTION FIRSTS; WINS IN NOVEMBER 
WOULD PRODUCE THE STATE'S ONLY OPENLY LESBIAN ASSEMBLYWOMAN AND A FATHER-SON 
TEAM IN OFFICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Westside has emerged from its state legislative primaries with two 
possible firsts. 
</P>
<P>
 One is women's rights attorney Sheila James Kuehl, who swept the Democratic 
primary in the 41st Assembly District Tuesday. Kuehl could become the first 
openly gay member of the state Assembly -- provided she wins November's general 
election fight for the swing district, which runs from Santa Monica into the 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The other potential first involves attorney Kevin Murray, winner of the 
Democratic primary in the 47th Assembly District, which includes the Crenshaw 
area and Culver City. Because the district is overwhelmingly Democratic, Murray 
-- along with his father, Assemblyman Willard H. Murray Jr. (D-Paramount) -- 
has an excellent chance of becoming part of the Legislature's first father-son 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 In another closely watched Westside race, for an open Assembly seat, Community 
College Board Trustee Wally Knox vanquished six opponents to win the Democratic 
nomination in the 42nd District. He will face Republican businessman Robert 
Davis in November for this heavily Democratic turf, which includes Beverly 
Hills, West Hollywood and Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, veteran state Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-El Segundo), who is 84, won 
the Democratic primary in the 28th District, which reaches from the South Bay 
up to Venice and Marina del Rey. His GOP opponent will be Redondo Beach 
attorney David Barrett Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
 Attracting the most attention, however, were the victories by Murray, who in 
November will take on Republican businessman R. Jonathan Leonard of Los 
Angeles, and Kuehl, who will face law student Michael Meehan of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing to me that I could be the first open lesbian to be elected to 
the Assembly," Kuehl said. "It seems so late in the century for there still to 
be such discrimination that we wouldn't have been there before now." 
</P>
<P>
 Supported by Santa Monica's rent control forces and by female voters, Kuehl 
was thought by many to be the front-runner in the race. But few thought she 
would win by as wide a margin as she did in her race against five male 
opponents -- all but one of them well-financed. Kuehl garnered 40.5% of the 
vote, with her closest opponent, attorney Edward Tabash, trailing far behind 
with 15.5% and outgoing Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman's hand-picked successor, 
Bill Rothbard, in third. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl appeared to have done extremely well in the Valley portion of the 
district, despite forecasts by some pundits that she would not fare well there. 
With 25% of the vote counted on Tuesday night, nearly all of it from the 
Valley, Kuehl was in first place with 35%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where's the mismatch between me and the Valley?" Kuehl asked late on election 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl's success in the Valley was a blow to Rothbard and Tabash, who had 
targeted that half of the district. Tabash, who was on two major slate mailers, 
walked more than 60 precincts, nearly all of them in the Valley. Rothbard 
blanketed Valley voters with mail featuring strong anti-crime stances but sent 
no mailers to Santa Monica renters. One Rothbard mailer recommended punishing 
graffiti gangs with "hard labor or hard time." 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, candidates in the race refrained from negative campaigning. 
But Rothbard put out a hit piece accusing Tabash of being a hypocrite on crime 
issues and accusing Kuehl of saying rioters in Los Angeles acted in 
self-defense. Kuehl struck back with one mailer to renters that linked Rothbard 
to real estate interests who oppose rent control. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 47th District, Murray attributed his victory over eight other Democrats 
to his family and community ties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a lot of response from people who actually knew me since I was a kid," 
Murray said. "In the end, we pushed the family thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Murray took 21.2% of the vote, edging out congressional aide Ed Johnson, who 
finished with 16.9%. Johnson had support from his boss, Rep. Julian C. Dixon 
(D-Los Angeles), and a group of Westside Jewish officeholders, such as Rep. 
Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-way race in the 42nd Assembly District was notable in that Knox won 
with a hard-edged law-and-order message in what is one of the most liberal 
legislative turfs in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox spent more than $400,000 to finish with 21.9% of the vote, followed by 
West Hollywood City Council members Paul Koretz and Abbe Land. Los Angeles 
school board member Mark Slavkin, who had a comparatively weak fund-raising 
effort, finished fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents criticized Knox for fear-mongering on the crime issue. But he 
defended his message, saying it was time for liberals to be tough on crime, 
instead of focusing solely on social programs aimed at reducing crime. 
</P>
<P>
 In walking precincts for five hours every day for two months, Knox said he 
became convinced that crime is on everyone's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Literally every single person I spoke to would tell me what happened to them 
or a member of their family or a next-door neighbor recently," he said. "The 
paramount concern on people's minds is the crime situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Dills' victory, meanwhile, came as a surprise to many who thought that, in 
this era of term limits, his age made him vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe all these people voted for Dills," said a disappointed 
volunteer for one of his opponents. "Most people in the district weren't even 
alive back when he (first) was a public official in 1938." 
</P>
<P>
 But a victorious Dills said voters liked his experience. "They like the power 
that goes with it," Dills said. "Despite the fact that I'm 84, I carry my 
weight. I'll be there rapping the gavel at 4 a.m. when a lot of them have gone 
home."

CONGRESS; DEMOCRATS REVEL IN PRIMARY WINS BUT LOOK AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Westside congressional delegation smoothly sailed through Tuesday's 
primary, but two of the incumbent Democrats are expected to face tough 
Republican challenges in the November general election. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks' bitterly fought victory over 
millionaire businessman Ron Florance pits her against first-term Rep. Jane 
Harman (D-Marina del Rey), who had no opponent in the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real job is ahead of us," said Brooks, who narrowly defeated her 
Republican rival in the coastal 36th District, which stretches from Venice to 
the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Rich Sybert, a former aide to Gov. Pete Wilson, easily won the 
Republican nomination in the 24th District, which includes Malibu, for the 
right to face veteran Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) in the 
general election. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, who trounced four rivals, said he will run as a centrist candidate in 
the fall and immediately derided Beilenson as "a classic, off-the-shelf 
liberal." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, facing token opposition, collected 87% of the vote to whip his 
Democratic challenger. 
</P>
<P>
 The two other Westside incumbents, both Democrats, are expected to get by 
their GOP challengers with few problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 29th District, which covers much of the Westside, powerful Rep. Henry 
A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) garnered 80% of the vote to defeat his lone 
challenger, Jon Rappoport, a free-lance writer. 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman, a champion of health reform who has taken on the tobacco companies, is 
widely considered to be a shoe-in for an 11th term in November in the solidly 
Democratic district. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 32nd District, veteran Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles) also 
figures to have little difficulty as he seeks a ninth term in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon garnered 90% of the vote, squashing two challengers -- businessman Peter 
J. Duvall and retiree M. Gordon Yaker -- in the district that stretches from 
Baldwin Hills and Culver City to near Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 But pundits predict that the Harman-Brooks contest will be quite a battle. 
</P>
<P>
 In Brooks, who won the 36th District primary with 51.5% of the vote over 
Florance, a former Palos Verdes Estates councilman, Republicans see a good 
chance to unseat Harman. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are slightly more registered Democrats than Republicans in the 
district, analysts believe the race may be close because Republicans tend to 
have better voter turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 After an especially rancorous campaign, however, Brooks faces some political 
fence-mending. 
</P>
<P>
 Florance, in a sharply worded concession speech, said that he was not ready to 
support Brooks, calling her attacks on his character and business practices 
"despicable." 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a campaign of smear and character assassination that is beyond 
reproach," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks used extensive research on her opponent's litigation history, which 
included more than 40 lawsuits over the past nine years that named him or one 
of his companies as a defendant. She portrayed Florance as a tight-fisted 
millionaire with a "tainted business background." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the race, Brooks defended her tough campaigning. "People think this 
is a high tea here," Brooks said last week. "This is politics. I'm not running 
for Jackie Kennedy's job." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Republicans worry that the lack of harmony could hurt the party's hopes 
of beating Harman, who already has a hefty campaign war chest and has lined up 
support among top executives of the district's aerospace companies. 
</P>
<P>
 In what may foreshadow the battle to come, Brooks on Monday filed a complaint 
with the Federal Election Commission, contending that Harman and Hughes 
Aircraft Co. improperly raised funds for Harman's campaign. Harman and Hughes 
denied the charges and have produced campaign receipts to refute the 
allegation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 24th District, Beilenson, the third-ranking Democrat on the influential 
Rules Committee, faced only nominal opposition in Sherman Oaks businessman 
Scott Gaulke, who had run previously as a follower of political extremist 
Lyndon LaRouche. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans, who blamed George Bush's poor showing in California for helping 
Beilenson to win 56% of the vote in the newly drawn swing district in 1992, are 
eager for another crack at the veteran Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 The sprawling district stretches from Malibu to Sherman Oaks and includes 
Republican strongholds in Thousand Oaks and the west San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert is the president of a small Santa Barbara toy company. He was Wilson's 
director of planning and research until last year, when he moved to Woodland 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert made a splash earlier this year by loaning his campaign $430,000 of his 
own money. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, he far outdistanced his closest challenger, Robert K. Hammer, a 
Newbury Park investment banking consultant. Newbury Park businessman Sang 
Korman, who spent more than $800,000 of his own funds in three previous 
unsuccessful congressional bids, finished a distant third.

KIM CREDITS FAITH BY VOTERS FOR WIN IN 41ST DISTRICT RACE; CONGRESS: INCUMBENTS 
MATTHEW MARTINEZ AND CARLOS MOORHEAD HANDILY BEAT CHALLENGERS IN PRIMARY 
CONTESTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The primary victory was surprisingly easy for Rep. Jay Kim (R-Diamond Bar), 
the target of an ongoing federal probe into alleged violations of election, tax 
and labor laws stemming from his 1992 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 His main opponent had sent out mailers saying Kim had "betrayed" his 
constituency and calling him two-faced for running as a reform candidate during 
his last campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 So how did Kim do so well? "Hard to say," said the nation's first Korean 
congressman after his victory. "I think (the constituents are) reading 
carefully and looking at my voting record and my record as a congressman and 
they're happy with what I've done. I'm lucky my district is very intelligent, 
very high-quality." 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, the congressman became the target of the federal probe after The 
Times reported he used about $480,000 from his engineering corporation to 
finance his 1992 federal campaign despite federal prohibitions. Kim has said he 
is, at most, guilty of technical violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim said he had not yet thought about his campaign for the general election, 
but he may have survived his toughest test. Voter registration in the district 
is 48% Republican to 40% Democrat, which does not bode well for urban 
redeveloper Ed Tessier, who won the Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
 The 41st District includes Diamond Bar, Pomona, Walnut and Rowland Heights, as 
well as parts of Orange and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim said the negative campaign took a personal toll, but at the same time gave 
him strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurt me. My wife cried. It was tough on me and my family," Kim said. "In 
spite of all the attacks, (the voters) love me. They have faith in me. I'm 
going to give everything I have. I want to be the best congressman in the 
history books." 
</P>
<P>
 Pundits said Kim benefited from the power of incumbency, which enabled him to 
raise far more money than his opponents. In addition, four challengers split 
the anti-Kim vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "The opposition vote (was) spread too thin," said veteran political consultant 
Joe Cerrell, who noted Kim finished without winning a majority of the vote. 
Valerie Romero, 30, finished her first campaign for public office second to 
Kim. She conceded the race shortly before midnight Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero's campaign was aided by her father, Richard (Dick) Romero, an auto 
dealer and political fund-raiser who helped her raise money and gave instant 
legitimacy to her effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero, a vice president of her father's firm, fired the campaign's first 
negative barrage with her mailers. But Kim quickly responded, saying she 
misrepresented his legal problems and calling her a political novice who was 
propped up by her father. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero said she would have done better if two other challengers -- Bob Kerns 
and Todd Thaker -- had not received so many votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a split vote," said Romero, who is now supporting Kim. "To take on the 
power of an incumbent was a great task, and if you divide that . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in the 31st District, Rep. Matthew G. (Marty) Martinez (D-Monterey 
Park) easily won his primary against a challenge from lawyer Bonifacio (Bonny) 
Garcia and two other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, who lost to Martinez in the primary two years ago, finished a distant 
second to the seven-term incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 He blamed his defeat in part on his opposition to abortion, an unpopular 
stance among many Democrats. Martinez is an abortion rights advocate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think abortion was the quiet issue," Garcia said. "Anti-Marty voters went 
with Marty or (candidate Maria) Escalante as opposed to me because of that 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia had run a negative campaign, hitting hard on Martinez's seemingly 
inconsistent stance on regulating firearms, his recent position on local Latino 
issues and his overall performance in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez is expected to hold on to his seat in the largely Democratic district 
against John V. Flores, who won the Republican primary. 
</P>
<P>
 The 31st District includes Alhambra, Azusa, Baldwin Park, El Monte, South El 
Monte, Glendora, Industry, Irwindale, Monterey Park, Rosemead, San Gabriel, 
South San Gabriel, Temple City, West Covina, East Los Angeles and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 27th District, Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale), the dean of the 
GOP members of California's congressional delegation, skated through his 
primary and will seek his 12th term in November. Elizabeth Michael, a former 
candidate for state Assembly, finished a distant second to Moorhead. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Kahn, an Altadena print-shop owner, won the Democratic primary and could 
present Moorhead with a challenge in November. Kahn received 40% of the vote in 
1992 against the congressman. The 27th District stretches from San Marino to 
Tujunga and has become more Democrat since reapportionment in 1992.

MARTINEZ IS EASY WINNER FOR ASSEMBLY; LEGISLATURE: DEMOCRAT DEFEATS CHU IN 49TH 
DISTRICT. IN 57TH DISTRICT, GALLEGOS WINS; SOLIS TAKES 24TH DISTRICT SENATE 
RACE. 
</P>

<P>
 Assemblywoman Diane Martinez (D-Monterey Park) handily defeated well-financed 
Monterey Park Mayor Judy Chu in the Democratic primary for the 49th District. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, who declined to comment after her victory, sought to neutralize 
Chu's scathing attacks on her performance in office by cultivating an image as 
a political maverick who kept true to her ideals while irritating Capitol 
insiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Chu attempted to portray Martinez as an ineffective legislator and used an 
aggressive mail campaign and a small army of volunteers to try to unseat the 
first-term assemblywoman. 
</P>
<P>
 As the centerpiece of her attack, Chu publicized a recent survey by the 
California Journal, a magazine on state politics, that rated Martinez as an 
ineffective legislator. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez's reputation received a boost last week when the Assembly approved 
her bill to allow Caltrans to continue the Long Beach (710) Freeway through 
South Pasadena without the usual agreement of the city, which has long fought 
the extension. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials and residents of Alhambra, which is in the 49th District, and other 
constituents strongly support the extension. 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to the primary loss, Chu said: "It's an uphill battle against 
incumbents." 
</P>
<P>
 Political experts agreed, saying that although Martinez may not be considered 
a legislative star, she has done nothing egregious to warrant expulsion by 
voters. They also said ethnic politics played a key role in the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of its sizable Asian population, the 49th District is considered one 
of the best for Asian candidates. In Monterey Park, for example, people of 
Asian descent make up 53% of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 But districtwide, Latinos are about 55% of the population, whereas Asians make 
up 29%, according to census data. The 49th District includes parts of Monterey 
Park, Alhambra, San Gabriel, Rosemead, Temple City, El Monte, Los Angeles and 
unincorporated East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates downplayed the role of ethnicity in the race, but it was 
difficult to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
 A large chunk of Chu's campaign contributions, for example, came from 
Asian-surnamed donors, according to campaign disclosure statements. Had she 
won, Chu would have become the first Chinese American in the Assembly since 
March Fong Eu, now U.S. ambassador to Micronesia, left the Legislature in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 Chu quickly jumped to a sizable lead in fund raising. But Martinez, with the 
support of the Assembly's Democratic leadership, was able to close the gap in 
the final weeks of the campaign with donations as large as $20,000, according 
to campaign disclosure statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Exact figures on spending in the race will not be known until the candidates 
submit financial disclosure statements this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez is virtually guaranteed victory in November because Democrats 
outnumber Republicans in the 49th District by more than 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Assembly's 57th District, chiropractor and Baldwin Park Councilman 
Martin Gallegos narrowly defeated college professor Tony Fellow in their 
Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
 The district includes all or part of Azusa, Baldwin Park, El Monte, Glendora, 
Industry, Irwindale, La Puente, South El Monte, West Covina and the county area 
of Bassett, Hacienda Heights and Valinda. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegos received some key endorsements, including those of the state 
Democratic Party and two area congressmen and state senators. He also received 
thousands of dollars in contributions from other chiropractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow had the support of former Assemblywoman Sally Tanner and the California 
Orthopedic Assn., a group of orthopedic surgeons who donated $45,000 in the 
final weeks of the campaign to keep a chiropractor from winning the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegos is expected to win in November. The 57th District has nearly twice as 
many Democrats as Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Hilda Solis (D-El Monte) did not seek reelection in the 57th 
District so that she could run for the state Senate's 24th District seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Solis easily beat former Azusa Mayor Eugene F. Moses in the Democratic primary 
in the District, which includes all or part of Alhambra, Arcadia, Azusa, 
Baldwin Park, El Monte, Hacienda Heights, Industry, Irwindale, La Puente, 
Monterey Park, Rosemead, San Gabriel, West Covina and La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
 Moses tried to make an issue out of a pending pay raise for legislators. The 
raise, due Jan. 1, will boost their annual salaries by $19,500, to $72,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Some legislators said they will decline to accept the raise in light of the 
state's financial problems, but Solis said she is still considering the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Solis benefited from the endorsements of Latino political heavyweights such as 
Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina. She also was able to raise about 
twice as much money as Moses. 
</P>
<P>
 The assemblywoman is expected to win the seat in November. Democrats account 
for 58% of the registered voters in the 24th District, compared with 29% for 
Republicans.

JUDICIAL; FRIEDMAN, MORIARITY HEADED FOR RUNOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After a race marked by a last-minute advertising blitz that included an 
airplane towing a banner over Downtown Los Angeles, Westside Assemblyman Terry 
B. Friedman finished virtually neck and neck with Van Nuys attorney John L. 
Moriarity in a countywide judicial election Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest for the Superior Court seat will be decided in a runoff election 
in November after what is expected to be an expensive and hard-fought campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In another Superior Court race, Beverly Hills-based incumbent Irving Shimer 
easily brushed aside a challenge from attorney Stuart H. Hirsh, who was found 
by a State Bar Court to be suffering from a "borderline personality" disorder 
and "poor impulse control." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was told at the inception of this matter that 30% (to) 35% of all the 
people who vote in these judicial elections vote against the incumbent," said 
Shimer, a 12-year veteran of the bench. "So I beat the norm." 
</P>
<P>
 Shimer picked up 71% of the vote, compared to Hirsh's 29%. Hirsh was rated 
"unqualified" by the Los Angeles County Bar Assn. and his license to practice 
law was suspended earlier this year for, among other things, keeping more fees 
than he was entitled to, according to the State Bar report. 
</P>
<P>
 Hirsh did not respond to a telephone call seeking comment on the election 
results. He said earlier that he was running against Shimer, who has been 
criticized for using sarcasm from the bench, because he "had never heard 
anything good about the man." 
</P>
<P>
 In Culver City, attorneys Paul A. Jacobs and Allan J. Goodman will face each 
other in a November runoff for a seat on the Municipal Court. Jacobs, a former 
City Council member, got 31% of the vote, while 24% went to Goodman, an 
ex-deputy state attorney general. Five other candidates also ran. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding his runoff with Friedman, Moriarity said that an endorsement from 
the third candidate in the primary, Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Schirn, should 
help him prevail in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 So far Friedman and Moriarity have spent more than $120,000 each on the race, 
compared to just over $11,000 for Schirn, the head of the district attorney's 
special crimes unit, who won 29% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Friedman is opposed to the death penalty and that is just going to 
present problems," Schirn said. He said he also favors Moriarity because of his 
more than 30 years of experience as an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman practiced landlord-tenant law and headed the Bet Tzedek Legal 
Services Agency, which serves low-income clients, before going to the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Moriarity, a civil attorney who ran as a strong proponent of law and order, 
filled the radio airwaves with ads in the days before the election. He also 
hired an airplane to tow a banner reading "Vote for Moriarity" over large 
swatches of the county.

ELECTIONS; BROOKS, SEN. DILLS TRIUMPH IN KEY PRIMARY BATTLES; STATE SENATE: 
RALPH DILLS, 84, BEATS THREE CHALLENGERS FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION IN 28TH 
DISTRICT. REPUBLICAN DAVID BARRETT COHEN WAS UNOPPOSED. 
</P>

<P>
 He may be 84 years old and a veteran of many long election nights, but a 
spirited state Sen. Ralph Dills swung into a celebratory series of saxophone 
solos Tuesday as returns showed him headed for a decisive primary victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Dills (D-El Segundo) and his supporters hailed his victory over three 
challengers as proof he will successfully stave off Republican challenger David 
Barrett Cohen, 34, in November. They also interpreted it as a clear signal from 
voters in the 28th state Senate District that Dills' long tenure in Sacramento 
is not an impediment but a strength. His legislative and judicial career dates 
to 1938. 
</P>
<P>
 Those voters "like the experience. They like the power that goes with it," 
Dills said as he took a break from playing the sax late Tuesday. "Despite the 
fact I'm 84, I carry my weight. I'll be there rapping the gavel at 4 a.m. when 
a lot of (other legislators) have gone home." 
</P>
<P>
 Dills squarely confronted the age issue by sprinkling his South Bay-based 
district with billboards depicting him toting his saxophone and emblazoned with 
the slogan, "Too old to quit."  
</P>
<P>
 While some had wondered if that approach would backfire, Dills finished well 
ahead in the race for the Democratic nomination.  
</P>
<P>
 Torrance Councilman George Nakano lagged behind, followed by Venice attorney 
Mike Sidley and Manhattan Beach real estate broker Jo Ann Rodda. 
</P>
<P>
 But some Republicans are promising to resume where his Democratic primary 
rivals left off by hammering at his long tenure in the state capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Democrats hold 53% to 32% majority in district voter registration, 
the GOP's Cohen said he sees a chance to win by targeting Dills' tenure and 
forging a coalition of minority groups he called "a rainbow on the right." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be a different Republican campaign in contrast to your 
suburban, white-bread, country-club campaign," said Cohen, who is half Samoan. 
An attorney and Redondo Beach resident, he was unopposed in the GOP primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen noted Wednesday that Dills failed to capture 50% of the vote and called 
that a poor showing for a sitting incumbent. He also stressed that Dills is a 
new face in much of the Senate district, which was extensively redrawn after 
the 1990 Census. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the only state Senate race (in Los Angeles County) where we have a clear 
chance of taking it," Keith McCarthy, chairman of the Los Angeles County 
Republican Party, said earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dills' campaign coordinator, Timothy Mock, predicted the senator's showing 
was decisive enough that Republicans may invest less money in challenging him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I anticipate that they will still target our district, but how strong that 
targeting will be is questionable," Mock said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Returns dribbled in so slowly that candidates were still waiting at midnight 
for voting patterns to emerge. Dills, sporting black patent-leather shoes and a 
polka-dot tie, passed the time by joining a swing band in such classic tunes as 
"New York, New York" before a crowd of about 100 at the Radisson Hotel in 
Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Sidley, 32, joined more than 100 youthful supporters in the back 
rooms of the trendy West Beach Cafe in Venice, where they cheered their 
candidate over pizza, beer and billiards. 
</P>
<P>
 Sidley blamed his poor showing on the general apathy of voters disenchanted 
with negative political campaigns. He praised Dills for maintaining a positive 
tone despite attacks from Nakano. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to run a positive campaign and to talk about change," Sidley said. 
"But I think people are frightened of it." He expressed satisfaction that he 
was able to communicate such ideas as his handgun ban proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakano finally conceded at 1:30 a.m., blaming two factors for his defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "One was that Dills was able to spend the money he was able to spend. . . . 
The other factor would be the splitting of the vote" among Dills' opponents, 
Nakano said.  
</P>
<P>
 Nakano, 58, got strong support from many local elected officials, and his six 
Torrance City Council colleagues visited his election-night gathering at 
Dante's restaurant in Redondo Beach. But the mood was generally somber, the 
only outburst of emotion surfacing when campaign manager Debbie Cox momentarily 
transposed the vote counts, mistakenly making it appear Nakano had taken the 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance Mayor Dee Hardison said she thought Nakano sent out his campaign 
mailers too late. As for Dills, she said: "He has never bothered to find out 
who the political leaders from his area are and come to introduce himself." 
</P>
<P>
 The redrawing of district lines forced Dills to campaign in new turf. The new 
district stretches from Venice to Palos Verdes Estates and extends inland to 
Torrance, Carson and Compton. 
</P>
<P>
 That, coupled with the large field of challengers, made this the strongest 
primary challenge of Dills' political career, which began in the late 1930s, 
and one of his most expensive. He had spent $337,000 by the end of May, more 
than the three other candidates combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Dills tried to appeal to liberal beach area voters, using his early mailers to 
emphasize his support of opposition to the creation of Japanese internment 
camps during World War II.  
</P>
<P>
 Nakano attacked Dills for supporting offshore oil drilling in the past and 
accepting contributions from oil companies. Nakano had the endorsement of the 
Sierra Club and the California League of Conservation Voters. Sidley was backed 
by the local environmental group, Heal the Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such efforts, Dills took the lead with the first ballot returns and 
held it throughout the night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe all these people voted for Dills," said Wanna Hadnott, a 
disappointed Sidley volunteer. "Most people in the district weren't even alive 
back when he was (first elected) a public official in 1938."

ELECTIONS; BROOKS, SEN. DILLS TRIUMPH IN KEY PRIMARY BATTLES; CONGRESS: RANCHO 
PALOS VERDES COUNCILWOMAN WINS BITTER RACE TO BECOME THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE IN 
THE 36TH DISTRICT. SHE WILL FACE REP. JANE HARMAN. 
</P>

<P>
 Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks narrowly won the 36th 
Congressional District Republican primary early Wednesday after a bitter race 
that left opponent Ron Florance doubting whether he would support her in the 
general election. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks, 44, will face Rep. Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey) in November. Harman 
was unopposed in the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now is the big job, guys; the real job is ahead of us," Brooks said to the 
remnants of her campaign staff at about 1:40 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Their race was the liveliest of four South Bay congressional primaries. Rep. 
Walter R. Tucker III (D-Compton) trounced his only Democratic challenger, 
Rancho Palos Verdes businessman Lew Prulitsky. He has no Republican opposition 
in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 38th District, incumbent Steve Horn (R-Long Beach) easily defeated John 
B. Duke and will face Democrat Peter Mathews, a Cypress college professor. In 
the 35th District, incumbent Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) will face Republican 
businessman Nate Truman. Both had no primary opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans say they have the best hopes of gaining Harman's seat. Democrats 
have a slight edge in registration in the district, but Republicans 
traditionally are more likely to go to the polls and vote for their party's 
candidate, according to political analysts. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bruising primary race may have divided Republicans in the district, 
which stretches from San Pedro to Venice. Florance, in a sharply worded speech 
conceding the race, said he was not ready to support Brooks. He outspent her by 
more than 2 to 1 by late May, but Brooks was able to cast doubt on Florance's 
business background through mailers in the final days of the campaign, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sad commentary on the political world," said Florance, a real estate 
financier and former Palos Verdes Estates councilman. "It's despicable. It's 
repugnant. This was a campaign of smear and character assassination that is 
beyond reproach." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the race, Brooks defended her use of character as an issue -- to 
the dismay of some Republicans on the Palos Verdes Peninsula -- as a necessary 
component of a primary. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think this is a high tea here," Brooks said last week. "This is 
politics. I'm not running for Jackie Kennedy's job." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks' campaign conducted extensive research on her opponent's legal history, 
which included more than 40 lawsuits over the last nine years that named him or 
one of his companies as a defendant. Brooks tried to use the information to 
paint a picture of Florance as a tight-fisted millionaire with a "tainted 
business background." 
</P>
<P>
 But Florance fought back. He called most of the lawsuits frivolous. Disputes, 
he said, come with the territory of owning a real estate firm that would do 
1,500 transactions a year. He characterized Brooks as reckless in not checking 
the facts before attacking.  
</P>
<P>
 "Let me say, I can look at myself in the mirror in the morning and say that I 
ran a clean and honest campaign," he said Wednesday. "I can live with myself. 
This woman has got a lot of things to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Florance, however, did send out a mailer in the final days of the race that 
quoted peninsula residents questioning Brooks' qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was constantly looking under every rock to find what he could on me, and 
he couldn't find anything," Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Brooks has argued that her pugnacity will prove an asset when 
campaigning against Harman. Possibly foreshadowing the battle to come, Brooks 
filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission on Monday, claiming that 
Harman and Hughes Aircraft Co. improperly raised funds for Harman's campaign. 
Harman and Hughes deny the charges and have produced campaign receipts to show 
that they did not violate election laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman already has a hefty campaign war chest and has lined up support among 
top executives at many South Bay aerospace companies.  
</P>
<P>
 Brooks and Harman differ sharply on many issues. Brooks co-authored a report 
for the Southern California Assn. of Governments that supported the North 
American Free Trade Agreement. Despite pressure from President Clinton, Harman 
voted against the pact. In addition, Brooks has criticized Harman for 
supporting the President's deficit reduction plan last year, which Brooks 
maintained might raise taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman signaled that she is prepared for a rough-and-tumble battle with 
Brooks. "I will not let unsubstantiated charges lie," Harman said. "I'm 
prepared to do what I have to do to get my true record out." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 37th District, Tucker easily outdistanced Prulitsky. Tucker is seeking 
his second term in a district that includes Compton, Carson and Hawthorne. He 
faces one challenger, Libertarian Guy Wilson, a seaman from San Pedro, in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 38th District, Horn was recuperating from surgery during the final 
weeks of the campaign and unable to wage a strenuous political battle. 
Nevertheless, Republican voters gave him a healthy win over Duke, a quality 
assurance consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 But Horn may face a tough battle in November to keep his seat for a second 
term in a district where less than half the voters are Republicans. His 
Democratic foe, Peter Mathews, captured more votes than any other candidate, 
including Horn, in the primary. Mathews, a college government professor who 
lives in Long Beach, was unopposed in the Democratic primary. The district 
includes San Pedro, Long Beach, Lakewood and Paramount.

5 DECADES LATER, A DEGREE OF JUSTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When the war came home to San Pedro, Frank Endo was a high school senior 
preparing to graduate with the class of '42. 
</P>
<P>
 He was well-known as a top school gymnast and one of the students who led the 
cheering at the San Pedro High School football games. Every night, he caught 
the ferry home to Terminal Island, where he and his family lived in a fishing 
village that he calls "Fish Harbor." 
</P>
<P>
 All that changed overnight in early 1942, when the U.S. government rounded up 
thousands of Japanese Americans on the West Coast and sent them to internment 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Endo left so abruptly that he could not say goodby to his teachers. When his 
class was awarded diplomas just a few months later, he and his Japanese 
American classmates were missing. 
</P>
<P>
 But this week, 52 years after that graduation, Endo is at last receiving his 
San Pedro diploma. In all, about 30 Japanese American students from the San 
Pedro classes of 1942 and 1943 were scheduled to be honored Wednesday afternoon 
at a special ceremony in the school cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were mostly a forgotten group until now," said Endo, of Gardena. "Most of 
us are all 70 years old. I'm 71." But despite their ages and the decades 
separating them from high school, this ceremony is still a milestone. Endo 
received a high school diploma at the Colorado internment camp where he spent 
most of the war, but he said it never carried the significance of a San Pedro 
degree. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of us still want the official diploma," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they are getting them, complete with the signatures of school dignitaries, 
said San Pedro High Principal Joseph Viola, who was to officiate at this week's 
graduation, organized by members of the two classes, some Japanese American, 
some not. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're asking for something they've wanted for over 50 years," Viola said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony was to be simple, without caps and gowns ("Those are for the 
kids," Endo said), but with a few speeches and refreshments afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the classes of 1942 and '43 had been together since elementary school, 
and about 10% were Japanese American. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say that the mood at the school changed immediately after the Japanese 
attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the students we knew since seventh grade, they wouldn't talk to us," 
recalled Miyo Higashi Shundo, 69, of San Pedro, who would have graduated in 
1943. She said the principal at the time held a special assembly for Japanese 
American students, advising them not to speak Japanese or to "huddle" together, 
but to mix with other students. 
</P>
<P>
 Shundo and her family were sent to a relocation camp in Poston, Ariz., where 
she remembers crying bitterly from homesickness. "I said, 'I want to go home -- 
but where is home?' It was just a desert. No sidewalk. No street. Just dry." 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, she returned to San Pedro, where her son, Don, graduated from 
San Pedro High in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Endo served as a U.S. military interpreter before returning to Southern 
California, where he runs a gymnastics supply company with his sons. He credits 
San Pedro High with introducing him to gymnastics and his future occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has attended reunions of his high school class, something didn't 
feel right. "We felt . . . not a part of the class, because we did not receive 
our diplomas. We felt a little bit outsiders." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that could change. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the expected guests at this week's ceremony are some who did graduate in 
the cap-and-gown ceremony in the school auditorium 52 years ago, including 
class President Richard Reese, 69, of Rancho Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think, golly, why didn't we think about this earlier?" Reese said. "This 
was long overdue."

CLOSE RACES PUT FIREWORKS IN REPUBLICAN ASSEMBLY CONTESTS

 Democrats hold all five Assembly seats that include parts of the South Bay, 
but the liveliest races were in the Republican primary.  
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Palos Verdes Mayor Steve Kuykendall beat better-financed opponent Jeff 
Earle in the Republican 54th Assembly District contest to face incumbent Betty 
Karnette (D-Long Beach) in November. 
</P>
<P>
 In another close Assembly race, insurance agent Julian Sirull beat insurance 
claims adjuster David Bohline for the GOP's 53rd District nomination to face 
incumbent Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey). 
</P>
<P>
 In the only contested Democratic primary for a South Bay Assembly seat, 
incumbent Willard H. Murray Jr. easily defeated former Compton City 
Councilwoman Patricia A. Moore and Los Angeles businessman Stephen Hamlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans say they have the best chance of defeating Karnette. Democrats 
hold only a slight edge in voter registration in the 54th District, which 
includes the Palos Verdes Peninsula and Long Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 Both Republican candidates criticized Karnette, saying that she would accept 
an Assembly pay raise that a citizens commission recently granted to 
legislators. Karnette's spokesman said she has taken no position on the raise.  
</P>
<P>
 Kuykendall spent Monday and Tuesday walking the precincts encouraging people 
to go to the polls. He had phone banks targeting registered voters that his 
campaigners had identified as supporters, especially in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Earle also staged an Election Day effort to get out the vote, standing with 
supporters at Pacific Coast Highway and Hawthorne Boulevard and waving at 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Earle, 35, who runs the Red Onion restaurant that his family owns in Rolling 
Hills Estates, said he will endorse Kuykendall in the general election. He said 
that Kuykendall's name recognition was "a tough obstacle to overcome" in the 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty close for a taco-flipper from Palos Verdes," Earle joked of his 
narrow defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Earle assembled a list of high-profile Republican endorsements, ranging from 
former Senate candidate Bruce Herschensohn to former Reagan Administration 
Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III. Kuykendall was endorsed by former Gov. George 
Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
 Earle also had more campaign funds. By May 21, he spent $87,000 to 
Kuykendall's $59,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no way we were going to match him dollar for dollar," Kuykendall 
said. "But we (had) a huge base of people working for us. It's a tremendous 
base that money can't buy." 
</P>
<P>
 But he expects the Democrats to invest money in Karnette's campaign.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to take a very hard campaign," said Kuykendall, 47, a mortgage 
banker. "You can be assured she'll be very well financed." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 53rd Assembly District, which stretches from Venice to Palos Verdes 
Estates, Sirull and Bohline differed on only a few issues. Sirull favored a ban 
on assault weapons; Bohline did not. Sirull said he would accept the recent 
Assembly pay raise; Bohline said he would not. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sirull spent about $2,000 to Bohline's $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe it," Sirull said Tuesday night when early reports showed him 
in the lead. "I was afraid I was going to get killed, that I was going to be 
embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
 Sirull, 36, cooked spaghetti at the Redondo Beach apartment of a friend and 
watched the election returns on television. 
</P>
<P>
 Bohline, 26, said Sirull did a better job of targeting absentee voters. 
Bohline fell behind by nearly 700 votes after the absentee votes were tallied 
and never overcame the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Republicans have all but conceded Bowen's reelection, but Bowen was an 
unknown when she won the seat two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "She hasn't done anything controversial," Sirull said. "But she hasn't done 
anything great either." 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats make up 43% of the voters in the district to the Republicans' 41%. 
"With the Republican registration in this district being as high as it is, I 
think we have a great chance to recapture the seat," Sirull said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 52nd District, Assemblyman Murray was painted by critics as ineffective 
and arrogant, but cruised to an easy victory as he defeated Moore for the

 Murray, 63, said his victory was vindication for unpopular legislation he 
authored that allowed the state to take control of the insolvent Compton school 
district last year in exchange for a bailout loan. Murray had long defended his 
actions as being necessary to save the struggling school system, and said 
voters would understand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never had any fear about losing," Murray said as returns showed him 
clinching the primary.  
</P>
<P>
 The campaign was expected to generate fireworks, considering the controversies 
generated by Murray and Moore. Compton civic leaders complained that Murray had 
grown out of touch with the district, which includes Gardena, Paramount, 
Lynwood and part of south Los Angeles. Moore's critics described her as a 
political opportunist.  
</P>
<P>
 But for all its potential, the race failed to attract widespread interest, and 
neither candidate campaigned aggressively.  
</P>
<P>
 Murray appears to be headed for his fourth term. He faces Republican Richard 
A. Rorex, a Gardena engineer, in November in the heavily Democratic district. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Juanita McDonald (D-Carson) appears to be headed for reelection 
in the 55th Assembly District. She was the lone candidate in the Democratic 
primary and will face only a Libertarian candidate, Daniel Dalton, in the 
general election. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 51st District, Assemblyman Curtis R. Tucker Jr. will face Republican 
businessman Adam M. Michelin in November. Neither of them faced primary 
opposition.

COMMUNITY NEWS: PASADENA; COUNCIL AGREES TO CLARIFY ORDINANCE GOVERNING CONDUCT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has voted to clarify the city's conduct ordinance, which is 
being challenged in a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union and by 
Councilman Isaac Richard as a violation of the 1st Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 After a closed-session discussion about the lawsuit Monday, the council in 
open session approved a resolution to make clearer the 1992 ordinance requiring 
council members to be civil to one another.The resolution succeeded on a 5-1 
vote, with Richard dissenting. Councilman Bill Crowfoot was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Rick Cole said the resolution specifically notes that the city 
conduct ordinance applies only to "conduct, not speech. . . . Speech is 
protected by the 1st Amendment and I support that," Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard, who has been censured twice after complaints from city staff members, 
lambasted the council members' move, predicting that the city would still lose 
the lawsuit. Richard's yearlong loss of privileges resulting from a June, 1993, 
censure ended Wednesday.

CANDIDATES PAYING HIGH COST OF LOSING

<TEXT>
<P>
 South Bay primary election candidates who dipped into their own pocketbooks 
may have little hope of recouping their investments. Those who chipped in the 
most ended up losing in Tuesday's primaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Ron Florance, running for the 36th Congressional District 
nomination to face Rep. Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey) in November, had lent 
his campaign $180,000 by late May. But he lost to Rancho Palos Verdes 
Councilwoman Susan Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 28th State Senate District, Venice attorney Mike Sidley backed his 
campaign with a $35,000 loan as well as a $50,000 loan from his father, Milton 
Sidley. But he came in third, behind incumbent Ralph C. Dills (D-El Segundo) 
and Torrance Councilman George Nakano. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the 54th Assembly District, Rolling Hills Estates restaurateur Jeff 
Earle threw in $25,000 and his mother lent his campaign $50,000. But he lost to 
Steve Kuykendall, who will go on to face Assemblywoman Betty Karnette.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH PASADENA; ASSEMBLY OKS BILL TO AID FREEWAY EXTENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Assembly approved a bill Thursday that would allow Caltrans to build 
the long-delayed extension of the Long Beach (710) Freeway through South 
Pasadena without the city's agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing fears that it would split the city in half and destroy historic homes, 
South Pasadena has vowed not to approve the extension. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, proposed by Assemblywoman Diane Martinez (D-Rosemead), revitalizes 
legislation written in 1982 by her father, Rep. Matthew G. Martinez (D-Monterey 
Park). 
</P>
<P>
 South Pasadena is one of four cities to be crossed by the proposed 6.2-mile 
710 extension north from the San Bernardino (10) Freeway to the Foothill (210) 
Freeway. Pasadena, Alhambra and Los Angeles have already given permission. 
Construction of the Long Beach Freeway has been stalled by South Pasadena since 
it stopped at the San Bernardino Freeway in 1965.

 To applause by local golfers, the City Council on Monday rejected a proposal

 After hearing from golfers opposing the $1 raise in green fees and after

COMMUNITY NEWS: LA PUENTE; CITY TO REQUIRE PERMITS FOR NEW LIQUOR OUTLETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The La Puente City Council amended its municipal code to require new 
businesses wishing to sell packaged liquor to obtain an unclassified use permit 
from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, only a license from the state Alcoholic Beverage Control Board is 
required. The amendment will take effect June 23. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure will give the city more control over new alcoholic beverage 
outlets, City Planner Gregg Yamachika said. In deciding on permits, the city 
will consider the outlet's impact on the surrounding area, how close it is to 
homes and the proposed hours of operation.

TOPICS; RELIGION; CRECHE BRINGS HEATED SUMMERTIME DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sun of late spring beats down on Sierra Madre, where the talk is all about 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sierra Madre News stirred up considerable passion last month after it 
reported that this year would mark the end of a decades-old tradition of having 
a manger scene in a city park from Thanksgiving to Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, say officials with the city and the Sierra Madre Chamber of Commerce 
-- which oversees the creche and organizes a candlelight walk and caroling. 
They say the manger scene will not be relocated. 
</P>
<P>
 Although newspaper editor and publisher Jan Reed stands by her story, city 
officials say the account about the creche was inaccurate and purposefully 
provocative. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a small town. Word travels fast," Mayor Maryann MacGillivray said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council "has never, ever had a conversation to change things" 
regarding the creche, she said. Nor, she said, is there reason to change. 
</P>
<P>
 City Administrator Sean Joyce was quoted in the newspaper last month as saying 
that "a small minority of complainants over the last three years vehemently 
opposed using" the sliver of a park at the town crossroads of Sierra Madre 
Boulevard and Baldwin Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 Because of that opposition, based on the principle of separation of church and 
state, Joyce was quoted as saying, city officials approached church leaders and 
asked them to consider rotating the creche location annually among the town's 
eight churches. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce declined to comment on the newspaper's account. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chamber of Commerce last year rented the park for the creche but Joyce was 
quoted as saying that practice would have to end: "What happens if a Nazi group 
wanted to rent the park?" 
</P>
<P>
 The news of Joyce's remarks set off immediate reaction. Each year, an 
estimated one in four of the town's less than 11,000 residents participate in a 
candlelight walk on the Sunday night before Christmas.  
</P>
<P>
 One letter writer to the Sierra Madre News called for a citywide referendum, 
adding: "I would like to confront the few individuals who must have an awful 
lot of hate in them not to allow something as sweet and harmless as a Nativity 
scene . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Another wrote: "If (people) feel the creche . . . is offensive, they can 
choose to ignore it, learn to accept it or move . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 But one letter writer, Ivy Dodwell, a 14-year resident, dissented. "My only 
objection is with leaving the creche in the public park," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodwell, 43, now says that she was among the few who have called city 
officials to complain, especially after city workers' time was used to 
dismantle the creche last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is city-sanctioned religion," she said. "There are certain laws about 
separation of church and state. I think people forget the concepts this country 
was founded on." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor says legal precedent favors the city. The creche, she said, is an 
international symbol of Christmas, as are the Christmas tree, Santa Claus and 
candy canes.

TOPICS; COURTS; $27-MILLION SUIT CITES DEFECTS IN TOWNHOMES; HOMEOWNERS AT 
543-UNIT DIAMOND BAR COMPLEX SAY SHODDY CONSTRUCTION PUTS THEM AT SEISMIC RISK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing everything from leaky roofs to fire hazards to seismic peril, 
homeowners from the 543-unit Montefino townhome complex in Diamond Bar are 
suing the buildings' developer, Presley Cos., for $27 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The homes, built in phases between 1982 and 1988, exemplify the worst excesses 
of the 1980s condo boom, said Lee Barker, attorney for the Montefino Homeowners 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Presley Cos. refused to comment while the case is in litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the late '80s there was a lot of shoddy construction because of the 
pressure to build homes," Barker said. "The homes with the most trouble were 
built in the years when the market was white-hot, during the 1987 to 1988 
period." 
</P>
<P>
 Those problems include leaking roofs and windows, broken water mains and 
slipping bathtubs, as well as grossly inadequate safety provisions, Barker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a serious earthquake these homes will suffer far more damage than homes 
built to code," he said. "The metal straps that connect the wood frames to the 
concrete slabs are not there or are improperly installed. . . . Under the 
stairway the fire barrier is missing, so people run down staircases into the 
fire." 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged deficiencies have hurt residents' abilities to refinance and sell 
their homes, added John Rafter, president of the homeowners association. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowners group is conducting structural tests to determine the extent of 
the problems. Barker said he hopes the case will go to trial in 1995.

TOPICS; BUSINESS; ORIGINAL HEADQUARTERS OF WHAM-O WILL BE CLOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENEE TAWA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mattel Inc. has announced that it will shut down the original San Gabriel 
headquarters of Wham-O, the company that brought Hula Hoops, Frisbees and 
dozens of other toys to the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattel is the new owner of Wham-O, which was founded in 1948 by Rich Knerr, 
who grew up in South Pasadena, and Arthur (Spud) Melin, who grew up in 
Pasadena. On May 31, Mattel closed a deal to buy Wham-O's parent company, 
Kransco, for an undisclosed amount. Mattel is the country's largest toy maker. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the Mattel takeover are still being worked out, Mattel spokesman 
Glenn Bozarthsaid. But Mattel does not plan to keep Wham-O's 
171,000-square-foot complex, which Kransco has been trying to sell for more 
than a year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Wham-O's eight buildings have been empty since 1982, when Knerr and 
Melin sold the company to Kransco, a San Francisco-based toy and sporting goods 
manufacturer. Within five years, Kransco had shifted most of Wham-O's 
production to Mexico and laid off all but a few of the 300 full-time employees. 
Since then, Wham-O's San Gabriel warehouse has served mostly as a distribution 
center for its three products -- Hula Hoops, Frisbees and Hacky Sacks -- that 
are made elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next few weeks, a majority of Wham-O's remaining 20 employees will be 
offered positions at Mattel's El Segundo headquarters or at its distribution 
center in the City of Industry, Bozarth said. He did not rule out the 
possibility of layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The transition signals an end of an era, said Danny McInnis, Wham-O's project 
coordinator and a 10-year employee. During the Hula Hoop's heyday, more than 
1,000 people worked for the company, which Knerr and Melin started out of a 
garage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mood here is kind of an end-of-an-era thing," McInnis said. "It's kind of 
a piece of Americana. . .that's closing out." 
</P>
<P>
 San Gabriel City Administrator P. Michael Paules said he is sorry to see 
Wham-O go, but he looks forward to a new business in its place. Last December, 
the Wham-O property was rezoned as a general commercial area, which would allow 
for retail stores and other businesses that generate sales tax. The Wham-O 
property is part of a redevelopment plan for the area.

TOPICS; HEALTH; MAN IS ILL WITH RARE FORM OF STREP; ALHAMBRA RESIDENT WAS 
STRICKEN WITH POTENTIALLY DEADLY BACTERIA THAT EATS AWAY AT FLESH. IT'S THE 
FIRST SUCH COUNTY CASE THIS YEAR. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Alhambra man is recovering from surgery after being stricken with a 
potentially deadly bacteria that eats away at the flesh -- the first such case 
reported in Los Angeles County this year, according to health officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The condition, a rare but virulent form of the streptococcus bacteria called 
necrotising fasciitis, has been the subject of lurid press reports in Britain 
recently, where 11 people have died of the disease since Jan. 1. Stateside, 
three people fell ill, in Connecticut and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County health officials Wednesday emphasized that this form of 
strep is extremely rare and poses little risk for public health. However, they 
said, they have seen a slight increase in the number of cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not being invaded by a new flesh-eating bacteria, and we don't see this 
as an imminent danger," said Carol Peterson, a medical epidemiologist for the 
county. "It's very unusual for these complications to result." 
</P>
<P>
 However, she continued, "we are concerned, as we are with every communicable 
disease. This is the same bacteria that causes strep laryngitis. In a few 
cases, more severe infections can result. Necrotising fasciitis is one of those 
complications that does seem to be increasing, but it's still very rare." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Kyaw, 37, was admitted to Garfield Medical Center in Monterey Park on 
May 20 with a lesion on his thigh, a hospital spokeswoman said. The hospital's 
quick-witted emergency room physician, Stanley Toy, suspected the rare bacteria 
because he had seen two such cases in San Francisco some years back. 
</P>
<P>
 During the two hours it took to prepare the emergency room for surgery, Kyaw's 
lesion grew from 8 centimeters to 20 centimeters to cover most of his thigh, 
said hospital spokeswoman Wendy Chan. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors had hoped to treat the infection with antibiotics, but it spread so 
quickly that they were forced to cut away the skin and part of the leg muscle 
to remove the infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Kyaw told hospital officials he did not recall how he injured his leg, 
allowing the infection to take hold. But he suffers from a muscle-weakness 
disorder, and health experts say this may have played a role in his 
susceptibility to the disease.

HAWTHORNE; COSTCO FILES $1-MILLION CLAIM ON LOAN TO CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Retail giant Costco Wholesale Corp. has filed a claim against the city and the 
Community Redevelopment Agency of Hawthorne for nearly $1 million, saying 
agency officials have failed to make payments on a $5.1-million promissory 
note.  
</P>
<P>
 Under an agreement signed by a redevelopment agency official in 1987, Costco 
opened a store on Marine Avenue.In return, the redevelopment agency agreed to 
pay Costco $5.1 million with a rebate of sales and property taxes generated by 
the store.  
</P>
<P>
 According to the claim, filed May 19, neither the redevelopment agency nor the 
city has made payments on the note for more than three years. Costco is asking 
for $953,000 in back payments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Costco site has been generating money and the city has been collecting 
the taxes but they haven't made payments," said Michael Greene, Costco's 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene estimates that Costco pays the city more than $600,000 a year in taxes. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The acting director of the redevelopment agency, Bud Cormier, said he does not 
know how much the city has collected from Costco or paid to the redevelopment 
agency, but he confirmed that the agency has not paid Costco. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is in financial straits," Cormier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Kunle Aderonmu said the city has made an offer to settle the 
case based on what it can afford but declined to comment on the terms of the 
offer. JON GARCIA

CRITICIZE THE $50,000-A-YEAR SOUTH PASADENA JOB, SAYING IT COMES AT THE EXPENSE 
OF MUCH-NEEDED INSTRUCTORS. BOARD DEFENDS ITS ACTION.

 A decision by the South Pasadena School Board to create a $50,000-a-year, 
full-time athletic directorship has raised the ire of teachers who say the 
position is unnecessary and will take up funding desperately needed for 
classroom teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not in our interest to have a new management position created," Pat 
Hawkins, president of the teachers' association, told the board last week. 
"Because of the financial straits we've been in the past few years, there's not 
enough money to create a management position that a teacher has already been 
handling." 
</P>
<P>
 The athletic director will administer all competitive sports in the district, 
work out scheduling, determine eligibility of athletes and serve as a liaison 
between athletes and teachers.  
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena High School teacher Jim Yang has performed those duties for 23 years 
in a part-time post that pays a stipend of $2,700 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Yang said he knows of no other district in the California Interscholastic 
Federation's southern district that has a full-time administrator for 
extracurricular sports programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what that guy is going to do all day," Yang said. "We're in dire 
need of teachers. Our math class is overcrowded. Our English teacher is 
overworked. Where they got that $50,000 is a mystery." 
</P>
<P>
 Yang said he was not consulted about the new position before job announcements 
were posted, and will not be eligible to apply for it, because he does not have 
the administrative credential the job requires. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Pat Martinez-Miller said the new position will expand the 
responsibilities that Yang has handled. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be some aspects of the job he didn't do: more liaison with school 
groups, a more visible presence with coach supervision and hiring," she said. 
"His interpretation of what his job actually entails and what we would like it 
to be are not congruent. And he was right. The job the way he was doing it was 
not a full-time job." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past few years, Hawkins said, the district has cut positions in the 
music, physical education, library and custodial departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been the priority to reinstate the cuts before creating new 
positions," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 South Pasadena Supt. Leslie Adelson said the cutbacks Hawkins referred to were 
several years old, and stressed that while music or gym teachers' positions 
were eliminated, no academic teaching positions were cut. 
</P>
<P>
 While the policy calls for reinstating frozen positions before creating new 
ones, Adelson said, the district determined that the athletic director was 
needed first.

TOPICS; FILM; AN ITALIAN TRAGEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY KAPITANOFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Italy beckoned German filmmaker Margarethe von Trotta six years ago. Known 
abroad for her intense dramas that focus on passionate, complex women 
("Marianne and Juliane" in 1981, "Rosa Luxemburg" in 1986), she has made three 
films in Italy since moving permanently to Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 Her most recent film, "The Long Silence," is a contemporary story of political 
corruption in Italy and centers on a woman gynecologist (Carla Gravina) who is 
married to a prosecutor (Jacques Perrin) investigating Mafia ties to government 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Living with death threats and a horde of bodyguards, their lives are 
physically and emotionally restricted. The suspenseful film, released last 
year, lays bare the tragic price Italian society -- especially honest 
individuals and their families -- has paid for trying to stop the corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Von Trotta is well-known in Italy. Yet the film, which is in Italian, received 
virtually no distribution there after an initial screening in Palermo, Sicily, 
in March, 1993, said Felice Laudadio, "The Long Silence" writer-producer with 
whom she lives. Most of the 30 theaters that had booked the film canceled plans 
to show it after that screening. 
</P>
<P>
 The filmmakers suspect that some people, probably the Mafia, pressured theater 
owners to not show the film. It ran in Rome, Milan and five other cities for 
only a few days before it was shut down. "People wanted to see this film," 
Laudadio said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was sort of a very strange boycott then," von Trotta said in a recent 
telephone interview from Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Long Silence" comes to Los Angeles as part of the Human Rights Watch 
International Film Festival that starts Friday night at the Nuart Theatre in 
West Los Angeles. It will also be shown June 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Von Trotta and Laudadio were motivated to make the film after the 1992 murders 
of the two leading Mafia prosecutors, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino. 
Von Trotta and Laudadio recalled the furor and desperation Italians felt at 
that time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody asked himself, 'What can we do? What could be an immediate answer? 
To say 'No, it can't go on like this?' " Laudadio said. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'We have the cinema, so let's do something out of it,' " Von Trotta said. 
"On one hand, yes, I am still German, living here. I'm in a way an outsider. 
But on the other hand, when I saw both these killings, the consequences, I 
cried like every Italian cried." 
</P>
<P>
 Von Trotta went to Palermo and met with several widows of prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Because these women were familiar with her film, "Marianne and Juliane" -- 
about sisters, one who works within the system, the other a terrorist -- "They 
already knew that I didn't want to use them just to make a spectacle out of 
their lives," she said. "I was interested in their way of feeling, also in 
their way of thinking and living after the deaths. They were very helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only after this meeting I thought, 'I have to do the film, also for these 
women.' It's a political film and it's a film which is dealing with a certain 
moment in Italy, but it tells the story from the woman's point of view, from 
her life, her fear, her love for this man." And how she goes on after his 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's screening in Palermo was organized with a Sicilian women's 
association established to counteract the Mafia. "That was a screening in front 
of 1,000 people," von Trotta said. "There were some judges and (prosecutors) 
with their bodyguards and there were some very angry people. There was a big 
tension." 
</P>
<P>
 After the screening, von Trotta and actress Gravina joined a group of widows 
to discuss the film with the audience. During that exchange, a woman stood up 
and told the audience, "You all know who killed my husband and you never will 
say it," von Trotta said. At the Palm Springs Film Festival, Laudadio had told 
a "Long Silence" audience this woman also declared that the suspected killers 
were in the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very strong moment," von Trotta said. 
</P>
<P>
 Von Trotta also remembered a man in attendance who described the film as "the 
first really anti-Mafia film because I'm not using all this blood and 
spectacular things, which then makes a pleasure out of the film, like all these 
war films," she said. "I just tried to show the consequences toward the people 
inside, which is much crueler than to only (show) dead bodies or blood. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the Mafia films, where you always see people running around with guns and 
shooting -- it's a genre in a way. I tried to kill the genre, or to go in 
another way. It comes from inside, the tension." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the film is a call for people "not to always be the victims," Von 
Trotta said. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Von Trotta has returned to her German roots, spending the last year 
in Berlin to make a love story set in the Berlin Wall era. Tentatively titled 
"The Years of the Wall," it begins with the construction of the wall and ends 
the first night of its dismantling, Nov. 9, 1989. It is expected to debut in 
Italy at the Venice Film Festival in September. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Long Silence" screens Friday at 9:30 p.m. and June 16 at 9 p.m. at the 
Nuart Theater, 11272 Santa Monica Blvd., West Los Angeles. (310) 478-6379.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CATALINA ISLAND; CHAPLAIN GETS 5 YEARS IN PRISON FOR 
MOLESTATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former chaplain at a Boy Scout camp on Santa Catalina Island has been 
sentenced to five years in state prison for sexually molesting two children at 
the camp.  
</P>
<P>
 Khamh Van Nguyen, 24, was sentenced by Judge Sheila Pokras in Long Beach 
Superior Court on Friday for molesting two boys under age 14 at Cherry Valley 
Camp last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen, who immigrated to America from Vietnam with his sister in about 1991, 
completed his studies for the priesthood at St John's Seminary in Camarillo 
last year but had not been ordained, Deputy Dist. Atty. Bob Villa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Schouemehl, Boy Scout assistant executive, said Nguyen had worked with the 
Roman Catholic church and youth programs in his native country. He applied to 
work for the Boy Scouts locally and was trained and hired as a camp chaplain, 
Schouemehl said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had the background in the Catholic church and the background in Scouting, 
and that's what led him to our doors," Schouemehl said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen taught at St. John Bosco High School in Bellflower before his arrest in 
September but was not accused of any wrongdoing there. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just here for a couple of weeks and then the situation he was involved 
with came to our attention, and he was suspended," St. John Bosco Principal 
Bill Goodman said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: HAWTHORNE; 49ERS FOOTBALL STAR HELPS YOUTHS TACKLE STUDYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON GARCIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During football season, San Francisco 49ers defensive end Karl Wilson tackles 
quarterbacks and running backs. In the off-season, he takes on more formidable 
opponents: seventh- and eighth-graders.  
</P>
<P>
 The eight-year veteran of the National Football League took time out from 
summer training recently to teach Yukon Middle School math students how basic 
math is used in the world of professional sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to realize that Mom and Dad aren't going to be paying for 
everything. (The students) are going to need the education," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson drove from San Diego to Hawthorne for the day at the urging of Yukon 
math teacher and family friend Charles Salter. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the students want to be professional athletes, and having Wilson teach 
was a good way to reach them, Salter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson used a fictional football player to illustrate the basics.  
</P>
<P>
 "If John Doe signs a contract for $350,000 for his first year out of college, 
how much money will he take home?" Wilson asked the students. 
</P>
<P>
 Silence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Will he get it all?" Wilson asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, they take taxes," said Jayvon Logan, a seventh-grader. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's right. Uncle Sam gets his share," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, Wilson tackled agent fees, salary bonuses, incentives, 
endorsements and the world of high finance. 
</P>
<P>
 "What should John Doe do with the money he makes?" Wilson asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buy a car and put it in the bank," said Bevlita Moore, an eighth-grader. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, he shouldn't, Wilson said: "He should try to put it in a tax-exempt 
bond or mutual fund. That way it will make 8% to 10% more . . . and it's tax 
free," he told the 13- and 14-year-olds. Some smiled and nodded politely. 
Others stared at Wilson with blank expressions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope the kids will ask the teacher or their parents about the things they 
didn't understand," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 While many students seemed intimidated by their 6-foot, 5-inch, 277-pound 
guest teacher, almost all of them wasted no time asking for autographs after 
the dismissal bell rang. 
</P>
<P>
 Studying, working hard and setting goals is the way to succeed, Wilson told 
the students. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not easy, but you won't be able to do what you want in life if you don't 
study," he said. JON GARCIA

SCHOOLS; RULING DOESN'T STOP PLAN FOR HIGH SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SULLIVAN and DENISE HAMILTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Gabriel school officials say they will go ahead with plans to open a high 
school in the fall despite a Superior Court ruling invalidating the 1992 
election creating the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, released late Monday by Judge Diane Wayne, found that the State 
Board of Education's decision to limit voting to residents of the 3,218-student 
San Gabriel Elementary School District violated the constitutional rights of 
the residents of the Alhambra City and High School District by excluding them 
from the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Alhambra officials said they were elated with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court ruling vindicates us; it says, 'Yeah, you were right,' " said Heber 
Meeks, superintendent of the 21,000-student district. "Our contention all along 
was that you can't hold an election without including voters in Alhambra." 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne's order, which declares the election null and void, restores the 
authority of the Alhambra school district to enroll high school students from 
San Gabriel. Until the 1992 election, San Gabriel students attended elementary 
school in their own district, then attended high school in the larger Alhambra 
district. The election, in effect, had San Gabriel seceding from the Alhambra 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeks said parents with incoming ninth-graders this fall should enroll them at 
San Gabriel High School in the Alhambra School District, just as they always 
have. 
</P>
<P>
 But San Gabriel superintendent Gary Goodson said their high school will 
operate as planned next fall pending an appeal. "We're going right ahead with 
our plans for the high school this year. This is part of the ongoing process of 
this legal issue. It's very premature for Alhambra to make announcements to the 
kids in this district to go ahead and enroll in their district." 
</P>
<P>
 Meeks said, however, that he requested the names and addresses of students 
enrolled in San Gabriel next year from the San Gabriel school district and will 
consider further legal action if the district does not comply. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids, at this point until an appeal is filed, belong to Alhambra, not San 
Gabriel," Goodson said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Gabriel has existed as a unified school district for two years. It has 
hired teachers, modernized buildings and prepared to enroll high school 
students this fall at temporary facilities in Jefferson Intermediate School 
until a new high school could be built. 
</P>
<P>
 But plans for a new high school were dashed in April, when San Gabriel voters 
rejected a $30-million bond issue that would have paid for a new campus. 
</P>
<P>
 This week's decision is the latest twist in a dispute that has consumed 
officials and lawyers for more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Controversy intensified several years ago, when the State Board of Education, 
in a highly contentious decision, ruled that only voters within the boundaries 
of the San Gabriel School District would be allowed to vote in the April 1992 
unification election. 
</P>
<P>
 This incensed officials in Alhambra, who responded by suing the State Board of 
Education. In a preliminary ruling issued March 22, Wayne agreed that the 
Alhambra district would lose state funding because of the election, a matter 
that greatly concerned voters in that district. 
</P>
<P>
 But Goodson pointed out that Wayne also declared that San Gabriel's 
unification would not harm the ethnic balance or disrupt education in Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many aspects of Judge Wayne's decision that can be appealed," he 
said. "An appellate judge taking a look at it is going to wonder how it was 
allowed to go this far."

<P>
 Teachers here will seek an 8.8% salary increase for the 1994-95 school year, 
union officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Torrance Teachers Assn. also will ask for changes in health care, dental, 
vision and life insurance benefits, said spokesman Bill Franchini. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's goal is to reduce employees' out-of-pocket expenses, which have 
continued to rise although the district's contribution to those costs has not 
changed since 1991, Franchini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Franchini presented the plan at Monday's school board meeting. The board will 
hold a public hearing on the matter July 5. 
</P>
<P>
 After members of the board have an opportunity to comment, the district's 
negotiators will meet with teachers union representatives. MARY GUTHRIE

COMMUNITY NEWS: INGLEWOOD; CITY OKS OIL DRILLING NEAR EARTHQUAKE FAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council voted to allow oil drilling near the Newport-Inglewood 
earthquake fault. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 3-2 vote, the council agreed to let Vortex Energy and Minerals Ltd. drill 
up to five exploratory wells on 1.1 acres next to Inglewood Park Cemetery. An 
offshoot of the Newport-Inglewood fault runs under the cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Garland Hardeman and Judith L. Dunlap voted against the 
proposal.  
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the project say that drilling would harm the environment and 
possibly trigger an earthquake. The main problem with the project is that a 
full environmental report hasn't been done, said Michele Grumet, an area 
resident and member of Coalition Against the Pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all about money," Grumet said. "It's greed over public safety and 
interest."  
</P>
<P>
 If oil is found, oil company officials say, the project could bring millions 
of dollars in revenue to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very pleased with the vote," said Alan Fraser, president of Vortex.

 This is the second time the council has approved the project. It unanimously 
approved the proposal in December, 1992, but a Los Angeles County Superior 
Court judge overturned the decision, saying the city failed to consider the 
effect drilling would have on the earthquake fault. The court ordered the city 
to study the effect of drilling, although it did not order a full environmental 
report.  
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap, who was not a member of the council when the proposal was initially 
approved, said the issue goes beyond environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "The residents of the community who will be impacted were ignored by the 
people elected to represent them," Dunlap said. The voters never approved that 
land for oil drilling, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition Against the Pipeline plans to appeal to the court to overturn the 
decision again, attorney Lawrence Teeter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is clearly not in compliance with the California Environmental 
Quality Act," Teeter said. JON GARCIA

COMMUNITY NEWS: EL SEGUNDO; CHEVRON TO RESTORE DAMAGED SURFING AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Chevron Oil Co. has agreed to pay up to $300,000 to improve surfing conditions 
along a stretch of beach near El Segundo that surfers say was damaged by the 
construction of a rock jetty in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement ends 10 years of negotiations among Chevron, the California 
Coastal Commission and the Surfrider Foundation, a decade-old surfers' 
environmental group, over how to improve the lost surf. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is possibly the most significant public mandate ever in favor of 
surfing," said Jake Grubb, executive director of the San Clemente-based 
Surfrider Foundation. "It recognizes the intrinsic value of a wave." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, which was approved by the Coastal Commission last month, 
Chevron will pay to study artificial reefs and construct a reef off the coast. 
Surfrider officials will oversee the project, and final plans must be approved 
by the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the study, Surfrider scientists will consider several types of 
reefs, including one made of sandbags weighing 1,200 pounds each, Grubb said. 
</P>
<P>
 A five-year study completed in 1989 showed that the natural sandbars on the 
ocean floor had been worn down after the 127-yard jetty was built, reducing the 
quality of the waves. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Coastal Commission granted a permit to Chevron to build the rock 
jetty into the water off El Segundo, the commission said the oil firm would be 
held responsible if surfing conditions in the area were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 The jetty protects the pipes that link Chevron's El Segundo refinery to 
tankers moored offshore. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevron proposed paying $100,000 for a study to identify ideal surfing areas 
in the Southland and study actions that would endanger or enhance those 
beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Coastal Commission agreed with surfers that a study did not represent 
true mitigation of the damaged surf. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement released Wednesday, Chevron officials hailed the agreement as 
the first of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
 "The agreement reflects a cooperative effort by the three parties to recognize 
each other's concerns and accept shared responsibility for the development of a 
successful surf restoration project," Chevron spokesman Rod Spackman said in 
the statement. JAMES BENNING

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY COVER STORY; TAKING THE HIGH ROAD; WHY HELICOPTERS ARE 
GIVING POLICE DEPARTMENTS A LIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Each pilot of a police helicopter has a favorite tale. 
</P>
<P>
 For Investigator Bob Mulhall, Pasadena's chief pilot, it's the time he caught 
two car thieves and recovered the stolen car without even trying. 
</P>
<P>
 One night, he said, he was simply sweeping his spotlight along the ground as 
he flew patrol when two guys slammed on the brakes and jumped out of their car. 
</P>
<P>
 "For bad guys, that light is like a death ray -- they have to get out of it," 
said Mulhall. "They always think Big Brother is up there watching them." 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena police pilot George Ramos' favorite chuckle involves the guy who was 
about to vault a fence to elude his pursuers. Suddenly, the suspect heard a 
voice in the sky from a seemingly omniscient presence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you sure you want to jump that fence?" Ramos' voice boomed through the 
chopper's speaker system. "There's a big dog waiting for you over there." 
</P>
<P>
 Rapid response times and the advantage of having an all-seeing eye to back up 
ground officers are two of the reasons more and more San Gabriel Valley police 
departments are following the example of larger cities and swapping beat cops 
for beating rotorblades. 
</P>
<P>
 One-fifth of the departments in the area have helicopter programs in place, 
and several other departments are taking a look at adding choppers. Pasadena 
and Pomona police and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which 
patrols several valley cities, have been flying helicopter patrols for over 25 
years. El Monte started its own helicopter program in September 1993 and 
Baldwin Park started a part-time helicopter program last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how a police department can get by today without a helicopter," 
said Lt. Terry Blumenthal, who heads up the Pasadena police helicopter program. 
</P>
<P>
 A major consideration fueling such programs is manpower: statistics from the 
state Attorney General's office reveal that the San Gabriel Valley is 
technically under-policed. The area's 19 police departments average 1.3 
officers per 1,000 residents; the national average is 2.2. More departments are 
finding that helicopters enable their finite police force to keep up with a 
load of calls that sometimes seems as if it's approaching the infinite. 
</P>
<P>
 Blumenthal points out that his team of a half-dozen officers, three pilots and 
three observers assisted on 1,000 arrests in 1993 and handled about 10,000 
calls. Considering the entire 222-officer department made 10,201 arrests in 
1993, his six officers were involved in one-tenth of all the collars made last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Helicopters so reduce response times. . . . You can catch people you never 
would've caught," Blumenthal said. "Our worst response time is 58 seconds, and 
when you consider cars take about six minutes to get to crimes even on priority 
one calls, that's a big difference." 
</P>
<P>
 One recent night, the infrared screen flickered in the fishbowl cockpit of the 
two-seat Pasadena police helicopter as the rotors beat the air and sped it to a 
crime scene at more than 100 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 The infrared system turns the world into a black-and-white negative of real 
life, with hot images showing up bright white and darkened city streets flowing 
across the screen an inky black, their borders defined only by the heat from 
the streetlights. 
</P>
<P>
 A man who had been spotted brandishing a handgun in a Pasadena neighborhood 
and officers responding to the call showed up on the screen like tiny 
characters in a real-life video game, the police the ghosts relentlessly 
chasing the Pac-Man of the fleeing suspect through the maze of the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more afraid you are or the more you run, the hotter you are and the 
better you show up," Mulhall said. 
</P>
<P>
 The helicopter crew spotted the man crouching in the bushes by the side of a 
home -- the heat sensors are advanced enough that footprints show up in grass 
on cool nights -- and even picked out the dark shape of the man's steel 
handgun, which stood out against the warmer background of the living grass. Via 
radio, the pilot led officers directly to the surprised gunman, who figured he 
was safe as long as he stayed quiet under the cover of the bushes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found this guy within one minute," added Mulhall, noting that with no red 
lights or traffic to contend with in the sky, the helicopter responded within 
30 seconds of the call. 
</P>
<P>
 Departments also find the helicopters useful in the search for ways to keep 
police use of force to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinning down a suspect in a spotlight and waiting for help to arrive is being 
seen as a preferable alternative to pinning down a suspect with a physical 
takedown, said Bryan Vila, an assistant professor in the criminology department 
at the University of California at Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's nighttime and you're chasing some person in the dark through back 
alleys, you have no way of knowing if it's some scared teenager or some three- 
or four-time heavy loser who's been pumping iron in prison and is heavily 
armed," said Vila, who served with the sheriff's department for nine years 
before going back to school for his doctorate. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if you have the helicopter, they can tell you, 'He's huddled behind some 
bushes, you're almost on top of him.' It's a much safer situation for you and 
for the suspect. The more control police have, the more they're able to 
attenuate their use of force." 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena owns five helicopters, one Bell Jet Ranger 206IIIB and four 
turbocharged Enstrom F28Fs, which fly about 10 hours a day, Mulhall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though police departments maintain that the high visibility of the choppers is 
a major key to developing the mentality among crooks that the long arm of the 
law can reach them anywhere, officers still field occasional calls from 
residents complaining about the aircraft buzzing like giant mechanical gnats 
above their houses all night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to address any kind of inquiry immediately," said Lt. Tom Oldfield as 
he sat in front of the phones at Pasadena police's Benedict Heliport. "We check 
with the guys flying and we'll tell (the callers), 'We're checking out a liquor 
store that's been robbed.' That usually suffices, most people will say, 'Oh, 
thanks, we were just wondering.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents of northwest Pasadena, an area well-trafficked by the 
helicopters, regard the hovering choppers as a necessary evil. "I would rather 
hear them circling overhead than hear shooting in my neighborhood and have them 
not be there," said Alma Nelson, a community service representative who works 
the phones at the Jackie Robinson Community Center and lives nearby. Nelson 
added she does not hear any serious complaints from neighborhood residents 
about the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Complaints are the last thing on the minds of area shopkeepers. "I can only 
give those guys praises and pluses on my behalf," said Walter Butler, 53, the 
owner of Walt Butler Sports Shoes on North Lake Avenue. "It's the one service I 
feel is totally worth paying for." 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona and El Monte report similar situations. "We understand that some people 
have complained about the helicopter," said training Sgt. Mark Sullivan, who 
heads up the El Monte program. "But we've also gotten petitions with 20 
signatures of people in support of the helicopter. And at 2 a.m., when you see 
a prowler, it's nice within 30 seconds to have a 15-million candlepower light 
circling your house." 
</P>
<P>
 Pilots admit that the hardest part of patrolling from the air is knowing where 
you are, and occasionally choppers drop low to read freeway signs or look for 
landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Most government-owned structures and automobiles, including low-income housing 
projects and city buses, are topped with numbers who help the crews find their 
way around. But most of the time, the pilots memorize landmarks and count 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos, 37, worked as a patrol cop for eight years before becoming a helicopter 
trainee. After passing a battery of tests, he worked as an observer for about 
three years before being trained as a pilot. While no pilots have ever been 
killed flying for Pasadena, he is one of the few who has been injured while on 
duty, shot during the riots that followed the not guilty verdicts in the first 
Rodney G. King beating trial in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "A fragment of a 9mm bullet came up through the canopy and ricocheted and hit 
me under the chin," he said. "Felt like someone had hit me in the jaw as hard 
as they could." He landed the helicopter safely and his wound turned out to be 
minor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crashes are rare among helicopters, as the aircraft can pivot their rotors to 
let air pressure keep them spinning even if their engines cut out. "I had an 
electrical failure back in the summer of 1988," Mulhall recalled. "My engine 
cut out and had to I put it down in the middle of the Fuddrucker's parking lot 
over by Michillinda (Avenue) . . . We put up some tape around it, and everybody 
just thought the police helicopter was on display." 
</P>
<P>
 Cost is the major stumbling block for operating a helicopter program. 
Pasadena's program cost $1.45 million, though Blumenthal noted that about 
$362,000 went to actual helicopter-related costs, with the rest going towards 
salaries for the pilots, observers and ground crews. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona's program used to boast three helicopters, but budget problems in the 
mid-1980s forced the city to ground two of the aircraft, said Sgt. Ken 
Gillespie, the officer in charge of the air support program. The Pomona budget 
is about a third of Pasadena's -- $465,000 -- but the department's Enstrom 
280FX still assisted on 300 arrests in 1993, and flies about five hours a day, 
five days a week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin Park and El Monte have been able to keep their helicopter costs lower 
-- around $78,000 per year -- by renting low-cost aircraft for a set number of 
hours each month, about 10 hours per week. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin Park Police Chief Carmine Lanza said money from the department's asset 
forfeiture fund and funds from public safety Proposition 172 is financing his 
city's helicopter program for the first year of operation. El Monte, whose 
program has been operating since September 1993 on a 10-hour per week basis, 
went the same route, paying for all costs through its seized assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Costs are cut further because the Robinson R-22, the helicopter used by both 
El Monte and Baldwin Park, is a low-maintenance, two-person aircraft that costs 
about $115 per hour to fly, compared with about $450 per hour for a larger 
chopper. 
</P>
<P>
 Lanza hopes to interest other departments in sharing the price of the air 
support. "We're planning on approaching chiefs in other areas to try and put a 
regional shared-cost program together," he said. Departments in Alhambra, 
Covina and Monterey Park have expressed interest, but most are waiting to see 
how El Monte and Baldwin Park fare before actually committing any financial 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's a great idea, a great program, but what holds us back is the 
money," said Covina police Chief John Lentz, whose city is still wrestling with 
a potential $1 million deficit 
</P>
<P>
 Though U.S. Helicopters, a firm based in Long Beach, is just squeaking out a 
profit on the aircraft rentals now, director of operations Bob Muse hopes he 
will land more contracts with more departments as they see what the helicopters 
can do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started out with this idea about three years ago," said Muse, who also is 
the primary pilot of the El Monte police chopper. 
</P>
<P>
 "We approached all the agencies in the San Gabriel Valley ... and before, we 
couldn't get anyone to listen," he said. "But once we got El Monte, (the 
departments) are actually calling me now."

COMMUNITY NEWS: YOUTHS FIND FEW SUMMER JOBS AVAILABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN STEINBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beverly Hills High School senior Neille Iliel is looking forward to a long 
summer. But instead of lounging poolside or on a sandy beach, she and thousands 
of other Westside students will join the seasonal work force. 
</P>
<P>
 At least they'll try. 
</P>
<P>
 According to high school career departments, the summer job outlook is 
anything but sunny. Rhoda Sharp, director of career/vocational education at 
Beverly Hills High, says there are fewer jobs available these days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five years ago, we'd have 50 jobs (displayed) on our job (bulletin) board for 
the summer," she said. "Right now, we have only six." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best jobs, a clerical position at a local law office, was expected 
to be snapped up immediately because of the $7-an-hour pay, Sharp said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids aren't going to run for the jobs that pay $4.95 an hour," she said, 
referring to a West Hollywood recreation department position that had remained 
unfilled for more than a week. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Sharp said, 127 jobs have been posted at the high school -- less than 
half the number of five years ago. The story is the same throughout the 
Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not getting the calls we used to, and it's reflective of the lousy 
economy," said Anna Paikow, career adviser for Fairfax High School in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "There used to be new job cards every day, now we're lucky to get one once a 
week," Paikow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, she said, she tells her students to go directly to nearby Beverly Center 
and other malls and movie theaters to find summer work. 
</P>
<P>
 According to career counselors and teen-agers, the types of jobs available 
depend in large part on the makeup of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Many students do not have cars, so they are constrained to jobs within walking 
distance or a short bus ride. That fact narrows the numbers of jobs that 
teen-agers can take, as well as leaving it up to the local community to hire 
the youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairfax High gets many jobs from nearby Universal Studios, the Greek Theater, 
movie theaters and local businesses; the vast majority of positions being 
offered via Beverly Hills High are clerical jobs in medical and law offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the stalled economy, many businesses in the area of Fairfax High 
have closed, and the competition for the remaining jobs has grown more fierce, 
Paikow said. Even jobs that pay minimum wage -- the so-called McJobs that once 
were the province of teen-agers -- are now being taken by job-hungry adults. 
</P>
<P>
 In Beverly Hills, there is a dearth of fast-food jobs, simply because the 
city's zoning code restricts traditional fast-food restaurants. And many 
clothing shops in the city seek sales clerks who are more experienced than is 
the typical high school student. 
</P>
<P>
 Having done a short stint as a sales clerk, Beverly High junior Kadiji Ellis 
says she would advise her fellow teen-agers against working retail. Most 
clerks, whose pay is often based on the amount of merchandise they sell, are in 
their 20s and 30s and are very competitive, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're working for a living," Ellis said. "We're working to buy more clothes 
and stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Monica, where retail boutiques and restaurants abound, youths are 
also finding a tight summer job market. Chris Robinson, office assistant at 
Santa Monica High's Regional Occupational Program, said students are coming 
into the high school office seeking summer employment, but she has little to 
offer. Only a few businesses have contacted the school to post summer 
positions, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sorry for the kids. They want to work but if the jobs aren't there. . 
. ." Robinson said. "Maybe they are hiring in fast-food places, but they don't 
call in here much. Students get them on their own." 
</P>
<P>
 High school counselors urge employers to make an effort to hire youngsters for 
the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really wish that employers would take a chance with our kids," Paikow said. 
"They want to be trained, they want to work, and they learn very quickly."

SOUTH BAY COVER STORY; THE PARKING PARADOX; BEACH CITIES' TOUGH POLICY ON 
VIOLATIONS CAN BACKFIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a Friday morning at Manhattan Beach City Hall, and the cash register 
was harmonizing with the sound of parking violators opening their wallets. 
</P>
<P>
 Manhattan Beach resident Mark Hardy took out two crisp $10 bills and handed 
them to the cashier. He said he got pinched when he parked his car and ran into 
a downtown coffee shop for a quick cup of java. When he came out a few minutes 
later, there was a ticket on his windshield. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just forgot to put a quarter in the meter," he said, stashing his slightly 
thinner wallet in the back pocket of his shorts and shaking his head. "That was 
a 21-buck cup of coffee." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy's neighbor, Laura White, understood. Moments later, she paid the same 
fine for a ticket she got while picking up lunch on Rosecrans Avenue the 
previous week. "I was all ready to get my sandwich, and then I looked out the 
window and, boom!, the meter guy got me," she said. "I try not to get 
(tickets). I hate 'em. But what can you do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Similar complaints echo across the South Bay, where a handful of coastal 
communities -- Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach, Redondo Beach -- are among the 
most congested areas in Southern California during summer months. Faced with 
critical parking shortages, these cities respond by giving out thousands of 
tickets each year. Hermosa Beach, for example, writes about 63,000 tickets 
annually -- the equivalent of three per resident -- and in fiscal 1992-93 
collected almost $1 million from scofflaws. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the parking problem is more than cops playing "gotcha" with weary 
motorists. Parking is inextricably linked with traffic flow, real estate 
planning and economic development. How a city handles parking can affect the 
quality of life and even the health of the business community. 
</P>
<P>
 Much more is at stake, in other words, than a ticket stashed beneath a 
windshield wiper. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is that illustrated better than in Hermosa Beach, where a hard-nosed 
attitude toward parking seems to have backfired and even jeopardized the city's 
economy. In recent months, city officials have moved to end decades-old 
restrictions that have kept businesses from expanding if they could not provide 
parking. Business leaders and residents say such policies were strangling 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get parking tickets all the time, and so does everybody else (who lives 
here)," said Robert Benz, a Hermosa Beach councilman. "Most of the tickets are 
written not to non-residents, but residents. It just becomes another tax." 
</P>
<P>
 But Benz argues that the city's parking problem is responsible for more than 
ruining a motorist's trip to the beach. He says that restrictive parking 
measures "killed" the city's downtown area. "That's why Hermosa Beach is in 
such dire straits," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 An engineer by profession, Benz says the parking problem is symptomatic of a 
larger anti-business attitude that once pervaded the city. Officials saw the 
goals of fostering commercial growth and building a comfortable bedroom 
community as mutually exclusive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Hunt, executive director of the Hermosa Beach Chamber of Commerce, 
summarized the age-old problem as simply "a lot of cars in a 1.3-square-mile 
city." City officials were concerned that new businesses would bring an influx 
of cars and worsen the parking shortage. So, beginning in the 1960s, they began 
placing restrictions on new businesses or firms that wanted to expand. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoning laws required four parking spaces for every 1,000 square feet of 
commercial space and 10 parking spaces for every 1,000 square feet of 
restaurant space. Owners could provide half the number of required spaces if 
they paid the city $6,500 for each remaining space. Many small business owners 
who wanted to expand or remodel had to pay tens of thousands of dollars because 
of a lack of parking spaces.  
</P>
<P>
 The result? According to commercial brokers and city records, the parking 
restrictions caused remodeling and rebuilding in the downtown area to slow to a 
trickle. 
</P>
<P>
 In January and February of this year, city records show, Hermosa Beach issued 
four permits for alterations or repairs on commercial buildings, with a total 
estimated value of $48,900. During the same period, by comparison, neighboring 
Manhattan Beach issued nine permits with a total value in excess of $828,000. 
In March, 1993, Hermosa Beach issued just five permits, with a total value of 
$23,100, but Manhattan Beach issued 15, with a total value of $417,979. At that 
time, Manhattan Beach also issued a permit for a new commercial building, a 
rare occurrence for both towns these days.  
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that no buildings have been built (or remodeled) downtown (in 
Hermosa Beach) speaks for itself," said Missy Sheldon, a commercial real estate 
broker in Hermosa Beach. "People were aware of the restrictions and didn't 
bother" to remodel or expand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our downtown is (in) a time warp," said Jerry Newton, a Hermosa Beach 
attorney and chairman of the Downtown Enhancement Commission, a group of 
business leaders interested in revitalization. He glanced out at the weathered 
storefronts of T-shirt shops and swimsuit boutiques along Pier Avenue. "It's 
basically the same downtown as 30 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Benz said that although the city collects almost $1 million annually from 
parking fines, costs related to enforcement and administration run around 
$780,000 per year, a figure confirmed by city Finance Director VikiCopeland. 
The resulting profit is so small, Benz argued, that it hardly justifies "all 
the grief and pain and suffering" inflicted on local residents. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two years city officials have taken a new tack. In 1992, a group 
of volunteer urban planners visited the city and delivered a 60-page report 
that recommended abandoning the parking restrictions downtown and noted that 
"merchants and residents alike resent overzealous enforcement of meter 
regulations." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the City Council dropped the old zoning requirements and is 
developing a plan to provide new parking and to revitalize downtown. The plan 
would have to be approved by the California Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, city officials have in recent months instructed officers to back 
off their take-no-prisoners approach to parking. Hermosa Beach police were once 
notorious for insisting on completing tickets even when motorists arrived 
breathlessly to put change in the meters.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've received directions to be more understanding of motorists, to try to 
relate to the community more, to give people the benefit of the doubt and not 
cite them (in borderline situations)," said Hermosa Beach Police Sgt. John 
Kearin. 
</P>
<P>
 Hermosa Beach is not the only South Bay community struggling with the problem 
of too many cars and not enough places to put them. Police officers in many 
communities say parking scofflaws help cause traffic tie-ups and block 
emergency vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighboring Manhattan Beach also aggressively tickets parking violators, 
collecting almost $560,000 in 1993. Any car with five or more unpaid tickets 
may be towed and impounded or immobilized with a Denver boot, a metal device 
that locks the left front wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parking is a big problem in the coastal areas," said Sheila Argueta, a 
Manhattan Beach community services supervisor, "because it's all high-density, 
with houses and apartments stacked on top of one another and very narrow 
streets dating from the turn of the century, when they were built to handle 
horse-and-buggies and Model Ts." 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo Beach collected $1.1 million on 43,000 tickets in just nine months 
from July, 1993 to March, 1994, said Budget and Finance Manager Lynell Soladay. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Farther inland, space is a bit more plentiful, but cities still enforce 
parking rules concerning street sweeping and fire lanes. Sgt. Stephen Baker of 
the Hawthorne Police Department said about 80% of the town's 25,000 parking 
tickets each year are for street-sweeping violations. 
</P>
<P>
 South Bay cities generate so many tickets, in fact, that municipal accountants 
have a hard time keeping up with them. So the city of Inglewood has stepped in 
to help.  
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Inglewood has marketed itself as the Big Brother of parking, 
selling its tracking and collection services to cities across the state, 
including Lawndale, Palos Verdes Estates and Torrance in the South Bay, and 
Berkeley and Palo Alto near San Francisco, said city spokesman Jim Nyman.  
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood's weapon? A computer mainframe hooked up to the Department of Motor 
Vehicles in Sacramento. If a scofflaw doesn't pay up, Inglewood informs the DMV 
and prevents the car from being registered. In 1992, Inglewood also pioneered 
the use of legislation that allows cities to deduct outstanding fines from 
state tax refunds. Nyman, in the meantime, has become an outspoken advocate of 
get-tough parking policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parking is a decision you make," he said. "You decide to park illegally." 
</P>
<P>
 Fines can more than double for late payments. For example, motorists charged 
with illegally occupying a parking space intended for the disabled pay a fine 
of about $330. If they don't pay within 30 days, they can owe $700 or more.  
</P>
<P>
 Hermosa Beach, meanwhile, is still smarting from its years of Draconian 
parking regulations, and reversing the town's fortunes may prove difficult. The 
city was $150,000 in the red at the end of 1993, said Copeland, and Benz said 
another shortfall is expected this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Copeland said recent years have seen layoffs and other cutbacks, with the 
proposed elimination of three more full-time municipal jobs for 1994-95. She 
blamed the shortfall on the poor economy and the state's precarious finances. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial remodeling is picking up, according to city records, but building 
department spokeswoman Sherria Lawrence said most of the increase so far is a 
result of the January earthquake and quake-related retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, city officials say no amount of urban planning is going to make the 
parking crunch go away.  
</P>
<P>
 "A city the size of Hermosa Beach," said Newton of the downtown business 
association, "can't fit all the cars that come through it on a hot Sunday in 
August. It can't, and it never will." Parking Tickets 
</P>

Bay cities during the 1993 fiscal year. Some numbers have been rounded off by 
reporting officials. 03,17,23,17 City No. of Tickets Issued Total Collected

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; LOVE CONQUERS ALL IN DRAMA OF A LIFETIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sascha Schneider always wanted to give his parents the wedding ceremony they 
never had, the one robbed by the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 As smitten teen-agers in a ghetto in Riga, Latvia, Helma and Benno Schneider 
had hoped for a formal ceremony. But that was destroyed when the Germans 
liquidated the city's Jewish quarter in 1943. 
</P>
<P>
 The only rite they managed to receive was a quick Hebrew blessing on a 
November evening from Helma's parents, followed by a bottle of Cognac. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they were trucked off to a labor camp. Of both sides of their family, 
only a brother and three uncles survived. 
</P>
<P>
 But 50 years later, after the Schneiders, who now live in West Hollywood, 
survived their ordeal and emigrated to the United States, their dreams of a 
traditional wedding become reality, thanks to eldest son Sascha, a documentary 
producer, and his wife, Laurie. 
</P>
<P>
 The acclaimed "Chuppa: The Wedding Canopy," which will be shown tonight at a 
Santa Monica theater, is a filmed recording of the wedding preparations and 
ceremony that explores the unique relationships within a multi-generational 
survivor family. 
</P>
<P>
 The 80-minute film was first shown in March at the Santa Barbara Film 
Festival, where it won the top documentary award. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been my dream to give my parents a formal wedding and to make this 
film," Sascha said. "This film deals with the transmission of a legacy of pain, 
suffering and, finally, healing." 
</P>
<P>
 After surviving the horrors of two concentration camps and a year of hiding in 
the Russian forest, where they fled while being transferred to another camp, 
the Schneiders returned to Riga after the war. The state granted them official 
papers recognizing their marriage, but a formal wedding seemed meaningless. 
Only a few relatives could have celebrated the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1992, on the 50th anniversary of their union, their son organized a 
formal ceremony that was witnessed by three generations of Schneiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie Schneider said the making of the film and the preparations for the 
ceremony itself highlighted the differences between generations and the 
difficulty in easing a painful history. 
</P>
<P>
 The giving away of the bride and groom, and the separation of parent and child 
it symbolizes, took on special meaning for Helma and Benno Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many camp survivors who have lost so much, any kind of separation is 
equated with death," said Laurie Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie depicts the family's struggles over cultural and religious 
practices. For example, Sascha and Laurie Schneider battle with their parents, 
and between themselves, over whether to continue such rituals as a bris -- the 
Jewish rite of circumcision -- for their son (she was pregnant at the time.) 
</P>
<P>
 Having grown up as an American Jew, Laurie Schneider confronts the emotional 
demands of her in-laws -- steeped in the traditions of the schtetl , the sense 
of a community acting as a family -- while trying to retain the integrity of 
her immediate family. 
</P>
<P>
 As licensed family therapists, Sascha and Laurie Schneider have a deep 
understanding of the intergenerational problems of families. Sascha Schneider 
has conducted many workshops in America and Europe for the second-generation 
survivors of the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 For many such families, concentration camps remain a forbidden topic, a 
subject too painful for discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Sascha Schneider said the children of Holocaust survivors in therapy sessions 
often spoke of a strange condition that would afflict their survivor parents -- 
"camp," a vague feeling of depression, withdrawal and anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every survivor had 'camp' when they came to America, but an important part of 
Jewish legacy is to keep talking, keep exploring, and that's what we hope our 
film does," said Sascha Schneider. Laurie Schneider said her in-laws "took 
tremendous risks to live, and they have taken tremendous emotional risks to 
heal" and pass on their experiences to their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Phyllis de Picciotto, artistic director of the Santa Barbara Film Festival, 
said the Schneiders' feature was the hit of the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The movie really touched people," she said. "I have a theory about good 
movies -- they make you laugh and cry, and this one surely did both." 
</P>
<P>
 The Schneiders are seeking a distributor for the feature and will show the 
film at a benefit for the Southern California Counseling Center at 7 tonight at 
Laemmle's Monica Fourplex in Santa Monica. Information: (213) 937-1344. ADRIAN

TOURIST 'LOST' IN L. A. RETURNS TO KOREA

 For Young Moon Kim, it was the vacation nightmares are made of. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim was visiting Southern California for the first time from South Korea, when 
$9,000 in items were stolen from the Gardena apartment where a friend had 
arranged for him to stay. Then Kim, 46, got lost while taking a walk May 12. 
Unable to speak English and afraid or unwilling to ask for help, he slept on 
the streets for three weeks, surviving largely on cupcakes and milk purchased 
from a small market in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim's disappearance prompted a frantic search by police and Kim's few friends 
in town, who put out the word at churches, Korean organizations, community 
groups, even the Korean consulate.  
</P>
<P>
 But a few days ago, his saga came to a bizarre end when he finally remembered 
the telephone number for B. F. Choy, plant manager of a Rancho Dominguez 
textile mill and Kim's main Los Angeles connection. Choy said Kim was near a 
golf course at Van Ness Avenue and El Segundo Boulevard, 50 blocks north of the 
apartment.  
</P>
<P>
 Unkempt, dazed and confused, Kim was anxious to get back to familiar ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim, who left the apartment with no identification, continued walking for more 
than an hour until he reached the Chester Washington Golf Course at Van Ness 
Avenue and El Segundo Boulevard. He told police that he decided to stay in the 
general area of the golf course until someone found him. 
</P>
<P>
 James Kim, who is not related to Young Moon Kim, served as an interpreter for 
him during his stay in California. He said the man simply did not know how to 
get help. As days passed, Young Moon Kim said people increasingly thought he 
was homeless. On a particularly cold night he built a fire, but firefighters 
arrived and quickly put it out. The tourist could not communicate to officials 
that he was lost, James Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Moon Kim found a phone booth near a fast-food restaurant and tried 
fruitlessly to recall Choy's phone number, dialing many wrong combinations. On 
Tuesday he hit the right configuration of numbers about 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 James Kim said he immediately drove to the 2100 block of El Segundo Boulevard 
to pick up the stranded tourist.  
</P>
<P>
 Young Moon Kim had to wait until Wednesday afternoon to head get a flight back 
to Seoul, where he works in a textile mill.

CITY HALL ROUNDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 BEVERLY HILLS: The City Council just may give its members an additional year 
in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members this week said they would consider giving themselves another 
11 months in office because of a change in the 1996 election schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue arose after the state Legislature changed the date of the California 
presidential primary from June, 1996, to March 26, 1996, so that it is held 
earlier in the presidential campaign. The Legislature also authorized cities to 
reschedule general municipal elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder's office, which oversees the 
elections, has asked municipalities that receive its help to reschedule the 
date of local elections from April, 1996, so that it is not so close to the 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has said it would be unavailable to help Beverly Hills conduct the 
April 9, 1996, municipal election because of the date's proximity to the 
presidential primary. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they require the county's aid to conduct elections and 
would like to reschedule the city election to coincide with an existing 
county-run election. The possibilities are Nov. 8, 1996, and March 4, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 November would not be good, officials said, because voters may confuse issues 
with the Beverly Hills Board of Education election already scheduled for that 
date, council members said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will vote June 21 on whether to hold the election in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 The terms of Beverly Hills Mayor Vicki Reynolds and councilmen Allan Alexander 
and Tom Levyn are scheduled to expire April 9, 1996. If the date is changed to 
March 4, 1997, Levyn, who would be the senior council member then, could rotate 
into the mayoral position without facing reelection. The two council members 
elected this year, MeraLee Goldman and Les Bronte, would have their terms 
extended from April, 1998, to March, 1999. MEETINGS NEXT WEEK

FBI PROBES ALLEGED BEATINGS BY OFFICERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The FBI is investigating allegations that a mentally ill 18-year-old man was 
beaten last year by Baldwin Park police and Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
deputies in two separate incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Undertaken at the request of the U.S. Department of Justice, the investigation 
focuses on possible civil rights violations as charged by Laurence Jones of 
Baldwin Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies responding to a complaint of a domestic dispute arrested Jones on 
Sept. 13, 1993, in the Baldwin Park home of his parents, Ralph and Barbara 
Jones, both 52. Jones, whose diagnosis indicates that he suffers paranoid 
schizophrenia and is manic-depressive, attacked police and was charged with 
assaulting an officer. He pleaded no contest and was sentenced on April 18 of 
this year to 90 days in home custody. 
</P>
<P>
 During his arrest last year, Laurence Jones was beaten by two Baldwin Park 
police officers, his mother said. Five days later, while he was in custody in 
the jail ward at County-USC Medical Center, sheriff's deputies beat him a 
second time as he was strapped to a gurney, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't know why he got beat up (by sheriff's deputies)," Barbara Jones 
said. "He kept asking could he get up out of bed to use the bathroom and they 
called him (names) and beat him." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the Sheriff's Department refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin Park Police Chief Carmine Lanza said, "Our officers acted 
appropriately and within policy. . . . They suffered worse injuries than he 
did."

 As soon as your eyes adjust to the Buggy Whip's dark foyer, you'll make out a 
group of photographs lining the wall. One shows Paul Darricarrere, owner of 
this Westchester stalwart, with two old-time Los Angeles restaurateurs: Raymond 
Andrieux of the Tower and Alexander Perino of Perino's, which was one of the 
city's premier restaurants from the '30s to the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buggy Whip is from the old school too. It opened in 1953 -- a dinosaur by 
Los Angeles restaurant standards. Judging from its popularity, though, it won't 
become extinct for ages to come, and the reasons are clearly not lost on 
Darricarrere, who took over the Buggy Whip in 1977. He has carefully maintained 
the restaurant's atmosphere: fresh flowers, soft lighting, red leather booths, 
caricatures from the '20s magazine Vanity Fair on the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Darricarrere owns a large fish-importing business, so there is always a good 
selection of fresh fish. As an appetizer, you can get Florida stone crab claws 
($14.95 for two), accompanied by a horseradish-jolted mustard sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Main course fish specials usually include broiled Atlantic salmon ($16.95) and 
occasionally Chilean sea bass ($16.95) steamed in foil with tomatoes, onions 
and ginger. Meat lovers can order a broiled 20-ounce Delmonico steak ($21.95) 
or veal Williamsburg ($18.95), sauteed slices of milk-fed veal topped with 
avocado and tomato. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunch offerings include large sea scallops sauteed in garlic butter ($10.95) 
and breast of chicken broiled with lime and cilantro ($8.95). From 5 to 7 p.m., 
$9.95 twilight dinners are offered with selections such as broiled mahi-mahi 
with lemon butter and beef tenderloin strips stroganoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buggy Whip is at 7420 La Tijera Blvd., Los Angeles. 645-7131. Open Monday 
11 a.m. to 9 p.m., Tuesday through Friday 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. and Saturday 4 
p.m. to 10:30 p.m. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

TEACHER HELD IN SHOOTING OF HER EX-HOUSEMATE 
</P>

<P>
 A high school teacher has been charged with attempted murder in using the gun 
in her former housemate's Glendora home last week to shoot that woman, who may 
be permanently paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Ruth Greene, 51, a physical education teacher and former teacher of the 
year at Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton, entered the Glendora home she 
used to share with Loretta Coller, 62, a retired teacher, Wednesday night and 
shot her in the upper chest, severing her spinal cord and possibly leaving her 
permanently paralyzed, Glendora Police Sgt. Tim Pfeiffer said. Greene also 
reportedly shot Coller's current companion, Martha Pereida, 49, of Alhambra, in 
the leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Coller was first listed in serious but stable condition at Huntington Memorial 
Hospital in Pasadena. The hospital is not releasing further details but doctors 
initially told police she may be paralyzed. Pereida was treated and released at 
Foothill Presbyterian Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene is being held in lieu of $300,000 bail and her arraignment, scheduled 
for last Friday, was continued to June 13. She is charged with two counts of 
attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records, Greene called Coller several times last Wednesday, 
saying she had had a bad day. About 7 p.m., Greene called Coller again and 
asked if Pereida was there. Upon learning that she was, Greene then allegedly 
threatened to kill the two women. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime between 8:15 and 8:30 p.m., Greene arrived at Coller's home at 2130 
E. Canterbury Lane. She jumped the fence and entered the home through an 
unsecured glass door in the den, Pfeiffer said. She armed herself with a 
.38-caliber revolver that Coller kept in the bedroom, police said. Greene 
allegedly fired a shot into a couch. Pereida then charged Greene and the gun 
went off three more times -- hitting Coller, Pereida and the ceiling.  
</P>
<P>
 Pereida called the police. When they arrived, they found Greene administering 
first aid to Coller. Greene told police that the gun had gone off accidentally. 
</P>
<P>
 She later told officers that she went to Coller's home to persuade her to 
resume their relationship and to discuss financial matters.  
</P>
<P>
 Records indicate that Greene's blood alcohol level was measured at .14. She is 
on paid administrative leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene and Coller lived together for seven years in the home near the Glendora 
Country Club.

 EL MONTE: A 19-year-old Rosemead woman returning to her car from church 
services Sunday was the victim of an alleged carjacking and kidnaping. The 
woman, who was not identified by police, said she had attended evening Mass at 
Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church at 11547 Iris Lane and was returning to 
her 1989 Thunderbird when she was confronted by a man armed with a handgun. He 
allegedly forced the woman into the passenger seat and drove away, ordering the 
woman to get out a short time later. After a pursuit on the San Bernardino (10) 
Freeway, California Highway Patrol officers arrested Eric Moore, 25, of Los 
Angeles. He was booked at El Monte city jail on suspicion of armed robbery, 
carjacking and kidnaping.

former boyfriend allegedly shot at him and caused him to fall on his head. Jose 
De Macias, 23, of El Monte is on life support systems at County-USC Medical 
Center, and Enrique Delacruz, 39, of Fontana is being held at El Monte city 
jail without bail on suspicion of murder. De Macias and a passenger, Anulfo 
Figueroa, 26, of La Puente, were driving east in the 11200 block of Dodson 
Street around 12:15 a.m. Sunday. A gunman who had been hiding in the back of 
the van suddenly appeared and began shooting, deputies said. De Macias jumped 
out of the van and hit his head on the pavement. He was not hit by gunfire. 
Figueroa was shot in the left arm and ran away. Figueroa was listed in fair 
condition at County-USC on Tuesday.

 POMONA: Police are searching for the owner of a medium-blue 1978 Datsun B-210 
station wagon that hit a 2-year-old Pomona boy last week and did not stop. 
Trevon Labert Mitchell suffered head injuries, including a fractured skull, 
after he dashed in front of the car June 2. He is listed in critical condition 
at Loma Linda University Medical Center, police said. Trevon was walking home 
with a group of children on the sidewalk along westbound Holt Avenue about 6:40 
p.m. The children called out for an adult to help them cross the street, and 
the boy's aunt, who was on the other side of the street, went to assist them. 
As the rest of the group walked to the crosswalk, Trevon ran into traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 POMONA: Police recovered about half a pound of methamphetamine, valued at more 
than $16,000, at a home in the 500 block of Lincoln Avenue on Friday. Officers 
served a search warrant after undercover officers bought methamphetamine, or 
"speed," from people at that address. Daniel Allen, 34, David Abernathy, 25, 
and Linda Pearson, 26, all of Pomona, were taken to Pomona City Jail and booked 
on suspicion of possession of methamphetamine for sale. A fourth suspect, Fidel 
Hernandez, 22, a transient, arrived while officers were still inside. He was 
found to be in possession of a quarter-pound of the drug. He was also taken to 
Pomona City Jail and booked on suspicion of possession of methamphetamine for 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
 POMONA: An 18-year-old man was in extremely critical condition Tuesday after 
being shot Monday night in his car. Bruce Haywood of Pomona was found lying in 
the front seat of his car at 12th and Main streets about 6:30 p.m., police 
said. He was taken to Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center, where he underwent 
emergency surgery. Witnesses said Haywood was shot with a handgun by male 
suspects who drove alongside him in a small blue truck. The investigation is 
continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 SAN DIMAS: A 4-year-old girl was killed and eight people were injured when a 
La Verne motorist allegedly ran a red light and hit two other cars about 7:50 
p.m. Monday. Angela Sundharawipata of Azusa was riding in her family's car with 
her father, mother and younger sister when the accident occurred. She was 
pronounced dead at San Dimas Community Hospital a short while later, sheriff's 
deputies said. Angela had been secured in a seat belt at the time of the 
accident. The driver of the car, Farah Kia, 39, apparently went through a red 
light at the southbound off-ramp of the Foothill (210) Freeway, deputies said. 
The injured people were treated at local hospitals and released. 
</P>
<P>
 VALINDA: A Whittier caretaker was electrocuted Tuesday night after he pried 
open an electrical transformer, sheriff's deputies said. Richard Freyre Jr., 
28, was killed about 7:45 p.m. outside a commercial building under construction 
at 18421 Valley Blvd., where he was employed as a night caretaker, deputies 
said. The electrocution caused a brief power failure in 1,640 homes. Freyre 
inadvertently tapped into a live wire, deputies said. They did not know why 
Freyre pried open the transformer.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MALIBU; MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO CHARGE OF SEX WITH GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 49-year-old Malibu man has pleaded not guilty to charges that he committed 
and photographed sex acts with a minor. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Bruce Sindoni, a producer for Malibu's cable television public access 
channel, faces arraignment June 16 in West Los Angeles Municipal Court on 
charges including statutory rape, oral copulation and having a minor pose for a 
photo in a lewd and lascivious manner.He is being held in lieu of $210,000 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors filed charges against Sindoni two weeks ago after employees at a 
Venice one-hour photo store gave the photographs to police. Police questioned 
him at the store and arrested him later when it was determined the girl in the 
pictures was 15 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 During testimony at a preliminary hearing Monday, the girl said she met 
Sindoni in January at KBU-TV, a nonprofit television production company that 
tapes City Council meetings and events for cable Channel 15. She said she and 
Sindoni began a consensual sexual relationship while she worked at the 
production company learning film editing and that the photographs were taken 
with her consent. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement to the judge, Sindoni accused the court of violating the 
minor's constitutional rights "to eat, act and be who she wants to be."

WESTSIDE COVER STORY; THE MAGIC TOUCH; THE LANDMARK MAGIC CASTLE TURNS TO A 
WITCH'S BREW OF MARKETING TO MAKE A HUGE DEBT DISAPPEAR. THE CLUB IS BETTER 
RUN, BUT SOME NOW FEAR IT FOCUSES MORE ON MONEY THAN MAGIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It commands a hilltop overlooking Hollywood, a Victorian landmark that for 
more than three decades has beckoned wizards the world over. Blackstone, 
Wilson, Henning and Copperfield are among the hundreds of illusionists who have 
been drawn into its elegant brass and mahogany halls, its dusty libraries and 
its vaudevillian theaters. There, they practiced the mind-boggling, the 
jaw-dropping, the flat-out spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
 But ask any member of the Magic Castle, and they will tell you the most 
astounding feat of magic ever performed in those halls was wiping out a 
half-million-dollar debt that only a year ago threatened to send the ghostly 
Victorian club to a fate no modern-day Merlin could have reversed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The club rallied, and we paid off all outstanding debts," says a relieved Al 
Davis, general manager at the Magic Castle, with a sigh. "As of now, we're in 
the black." 
</P>
<P>
 In the process of clearing the slate, however, the Magic Castle was forced to 
turn to a witch's brew of marketing that effectively transformed it into a very 
different place of business from the venerable private club that had survived 
for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Once operated as a simple gathering spot for local magicians and magic buffs, 
today's Castle is run like a multimillion-dollar business, with all of its 
attendant benefits and drawbacks. Non-magicians' membership fees, for a decade 
only $220 a year, have been boosted nearly 50% -- to $325 -- as part of a major 
fund-raising effort to meet the club's operating budget of about $3 million a 
year. Gone are the sympathetic booking policies, where a magician with more 
heart than talent occasionally got a chance to perform in one of the magic 
community's finest venues. Missing most of all is a piece of the club's 
exclusivity, with large groups and corporations now able to rent the Castle on 
any given day and a governing board that has held preliminary discussions about 
opening the club to the public one night a week. 
</P>
<P>
 In its place is a club that is more professionally run and offers better 
entertainment for the casual guest, but which some magicians fear is focused 
more on money than magic. Under new Castle policies, most of the performers 
must be experienced club favorites. Only about 10% of the acts are new talent. 
</P>
<P>
 A financial analyst reviews all of the club's statements each month and Castle 
directors review the findings. With the addition of special theme nights, and 
even the possibility of establishing a gift shop, there is new hope that club 
membership will rise after nearly 10 years of holding steady at 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Castle was well-run before, but by people who were inexperienced with 
multimillion-dollar businesses," says Lewis Horwitz, an investment banker who 
last year became treasurer for the nonprofit Academy of Magical Arts, the group 
that operates the Magic Castle. "Sure, there are a lot of good business people 
who were on the board (in the past), but the academy grew to very substantial 
proportions, and then when the recession hit and people stopped going to dinner 
as much as they used to, the directors didn't want to cut anything out for the 
membership. Expenses stayed the same, while income went down, down, down." 
</P>
<P>
 At about the same time, the Castle's president, co-founder and business 
manager, Bill Larsen, was stricken with a lengthy illness and eventually died 
of a liver ailment in February, 1993. At the time of Larsen's death, the club 
had a $200,000 bank loan outstanding and faced $300,000 in additional bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came in and said, 'All right, you guys, this is what you have to do,' " 
says Horwitz, who believes the club's longtime focus on magic and service to 
its membership had the undesired effect of delaying belt-tightening. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Horwitz's direction, the academy's board ordered a 50% increase in 
membership dues -- for non-magicians -- and upped the entrance fee for new 
members from $800 to $900. In addition, the Castle's 5,000 members were asked 
to make a one-time contribution of $100 each and efforts to rent the Castle to 
private parties were stepped up, making the building available five days a week 
instead of two. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a sharp departure for a club that had grown out of one family's 
enthusiasm for magic. The Castle was founded in 1963 by Larsen, then an 
associate producer at CBS, and his brother, Milt Jr., a writer for the Truth or 
Consequences television show. The pair, fans of magic since they were children, 
found a home for their club in a hilltop mansion built in 1908, once a 
residence overlooking an orange grove. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lew Horwitz has done the greatest magic act I've ever seen, because he's been 
able to take what had been a very casual kind of operation and give it some 
very specific business responsibilities and parameters," says Harry Blackstone 
Jr., a new member of the Castle's board of directors and a performer at the 
Castle since first appearing there with his legendary father in the early 
1960s. "It needs to be run that way, and there are only a few who have to take 
that attitude, so therefore the others can just come in and enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
 Cognizant of a skeptical membership, Castle management has been careful to 
avoid becoming too blatant about its newly adopted marketing practices. Michael 
Fleming, who heads up the Castle's efforts to persuade corporations and groups 
to rent the building for board meetings and other gatherings, says he has 
intentionally avoided running advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to approach businesses on a low-key basis," Fleming says. "I wouldn't 
want to go outside of low-key, person-to-person contact. I talk to (Castle) 
members on the phone, tell them what we can do for them or their company. I 
mean, if a company is doing an instructional seminar, before the VP comes out, 
you have a magician loosen up the crowd and all of a sudden the VP becomes a 
lot more listenable." 
</P>
<P>
 Companies such as AT&T, Shell Oil and Northrop Management Assn. have paid from 
$25 to $70 a head (the price varies according to the scope of the event) to 
rent the Castle within the past several months. With a minimum group of 40 
people required to book the Castle, these efforts have resulted in income of 
several thousand dollars per booking. 
</P>
<P>
 The academy's management cites member donations and increased fees as reasons 
that the Castle was able to wipe out its debts, but several board members 
privately admit that it was the corporate parties that made the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Complaints among magicians about the Castle's rental policies have been low. 
The same cannot be said for the informal discussions about whether the club 
should open to the public one night a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would cut into the exclusivity of the Castle," says Brian Gillis, a 
Redondo Beach magician who has appeared on the Tonight Show and performs at the 
Castle several times a year. "When I was out here from Tennessee, I'd tell 
someone I was working the Magic Castle and it was, 'Oh my god, can you get me 
in? Can you get me a pass?' It was really an exciting thing. If it opens to the 
public, it won't be like that. Right now it has a lot of prestige, and you get 
audiences that really appreciate the skill and the talent of what you're 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Most magicians agree, saying the Castle is the one place where they garner 
respect from an audience, rather than being viewed as con men who know a few 
card tricks. As a result, Milt Larsen Jr. says he would do everything he could 
to prevent public access. Larsen leases the Castle from the Thomas Glover 
Estate and sublets it to the academy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the mystique of the Castle is based on it being a private club, and 
frankly, if it ever came down to a vote, I would be totally against (opening to 
the public)," says Larsen, who is not an academy board member but attends the 
meetings as the club's co-founder. "It would be a tremendous mistake, and I 
really don't think it was ever seriously considered. Certainly, if they got 
that hard up for business there would be other ways to make money." 
</P>
<P>
 But Horwitz and other board members tell a different story, saying that while 
the matter has tentatively been tabled, it is far from concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to be honest with you. That's something that we have been discussing 
and we've had debates on it until we were blue in the face," Horwitz says. "We 
have not acquiesced to that as yet, only because one of the things that has 
kept the Castle going is the mystique and part of the mystique is that you 
absolutely cannot come unless you are the guest of a member." 
</P>
<P>
 Blackstone, citing the same mystique, said he too would oppose opening the 
club to the public and claimed the matter had not come up since he joined the 
academy board in January. But he also made it clear that he would "not discuss 
the business of the board outside of the board. We're all given to keeping 
secrets in the world of magic. They're like secrets in the military; you only 
tell those with a need to know." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Horwitz expects the matter to come up again at some point. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been no final decision, but we have not closed our minds to it," he 
says. "I would be willing, personally, to try it for a limited period of time 
and see whether it works or not, but I haven't polled the rest of the board 
because we discussed it in a different context and we've not come to a decision 
on it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the changes in the Castle's approach to doing business have 
not affected its vaunted status among magicians, who gather nightly to exchange 
tips, watch each other's acts, or just study the art of magic in the Castle's 
20,000-book library. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many magicians there, and there (is) a good stable of reference 
material to work with," says magician Gillis. "I go there and see guys with 
different types of gimmicks -- guys who invented different tricks. They're like 
magic nerds, guys that invent very creative magic presentations and effects, 
and they're real creative-genius types, so it's a pretty neat place to make 
contacts." 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, Gillis says, the acts are consistently better since changes were 
made to the booking policies.  
</P>
<P>
 "They've gotten more conscientious lately about booking better acts," Gillis 
says. "A lot of times in the past there might have been some situations where, 
'This guy's a real nice guy. He's a member. He has a good personality. Let's 
give him a week.' I think they're more concerned about the caliber of performer 
now. The last three times I've been there, there have been some dynamite acts." 
</P>
<P>
 The academy still operates a youth organization that gives children the chance 
to perform with and be critiqued by top-name magicians. In addition, a $30,000 
expansion to the Castle's basement is nearly complete, dedicated to performance 
art and featuring collectibles such as Jimmy Durante's breakaway piano and the 
bar from "Hello, Dolly." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, the Castle's general manager, says the new emphasis on good business 
will not mean the club will stray from its original goal of teaching and 
promoting magic. He also admits that as a non-magician, it can be difficult to 
run a business that is not 100% dedicated to turning a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been approached by people all over the world to create another Magic 
Castle, but I'm a bottom-line kind of guy, and this place just doesn't work" 
strictly as a business proposition, Davis said. "It's the love of magic that 
makes it go, so while you're compelled to make decisions for a business reason, 
every time you make a move you do so in consideration of the membership. This 
wasn't intended to be a money-making expedition." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the Castle's 75 employees were laid off during last year's revamping, 
and Davis says he now hopes to expand by importing more acts from Europe and 
launching a series of instructional seminars that would travel throughout the 
United States as part of the current membership drive. The academy has also 
established an executive committee of magician and associate members, asking 
them to review all Castle policies and provide opinions on offering perks such 
as free dinners for members on their birthdays. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, what we must do and are dedicated to doing is to increase the 
pleasure of the membership," says Horwitz, who notes he is investigating 
whether the IRS will classify member dues as tax-deductible. "For a long time, 
with the Castle short of money, they didn't cut anything but they didn't do 
anything, either. We want to try to run the club as a business, but keep the 
thought in mind that you increase that business by making the membership very 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the Castle's legendary status, happy is what they seem to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably the nicest place to showcase in the L.A. area," Gillis says. 
"It's nationally famous because it's the only place of its kind, and in the 
magic community it's ultra-famous." 
</P>
<P>
 Sums up Blackstone, whose father's name is bestowed on one of the Castle's 
rooms: "It's really the lifeblood of all the hobbyists and the professionals in 
magic."

<P>
 Environmentalists are having some success as they try to stop plans by the 
city of Gardena to build a market next to a wetland.  
</P>
<P>
 Smith's Food and Drug Centers has indicated it will consider alternatives to 
the site at Artesia Boulevard and Vermont Avenue if the city and the developer 
are willing. 
</P>
<P>
 And developer John Vidovich, a partner at De Anza Properties in Sunnyvale, 
said that although he does not believe the 64,000-square-foot market will 
affect the adjacent 7.3-acre willow wetland, he is also willing to look at 
other sites in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to do some economic revitalization for the area, but nobody 
wants to hurt the wetland, including me," Vidovich said.  
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the plan say noise, litter and runoff from the development would 
threaten the wildlife that inhabits the wetland, including ducks that rest 
there every winter on their migration from Canada to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Known as the Gardena Willows, the patch of dense vegetation is all that 
remains of a vernal marsh that once stretched over 15 square miles of the South 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The market) will box it in with development all the way around," said Walt 
Wright, a consulting ecologist. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got commercial development on the west side, you've got apartments and 
roads, and then you put a wall of a building all along the last side." 
</P>
<P>
 Gardena resident Sherry Roberts is leading local opposition and has been 
joined by Torrance-based Friends of Madrona Marsh and the Harbor Park Advisory 
Board in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will pursue all legal means to prevent commercial development on one of 
the last remaining wetland areas in the South Bay," said Frank O'Brien of the 
Harbor Park group. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmentalists argue that the market should be relocated and an 
interpretive center built on the acreage with $1 million the city recently 
received in Proposition A funds to enhance the wetland. The rest of the land 
should be left as a buffer zone, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, city officials are divided on the development plan. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kenneth Landau said an agreement with Caltrans to buy the eight 
acres for $3.74 million is in escrow and the city is intent on putting the 
market on that site. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Jim Cragin, a longtime supporter of preserving the Gardena 
Willows, believes several sites on Rosecrans Avenue would be suitable for the 
market.

BRIEFLY; COLLEGES: MARYMOUNT LOSES BID FOR SITE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Marymount College lost out on its bid for Northrop Corp.'s research and 
technology center on Crest Road in Rolling Hills Estates. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop accepted a higher offer of about $17 million from an unnamed spa 
company, a source said. 
</P>
<P>
 The college's bid was between $14.5 million and $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't compete with those figures," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Competition for the 34.4-acre site intensified when Marymount delivered an 
offer to Northrop after a special meeting of the college's board of trustees 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
 College officials said they hoped to begin classes at the new campus in 
September, 1995. President Thomas McFadden said the site would have allowed 
students now housed in San Pedro to live on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're disappointed," McFadden said Monday. "We really think it would have 
been a very good site for the college." 
</P>
<P>
 The Northrop site, which has seven buildings, was built in 1961 and has been 
for sale since 1991. SUSAN WOODWARD

BRIEFLY; FESTIVALS: LOMITA SEEKS DONATIONS FOR FIREWORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lomita is trying to give its 30th anniversary celebration more of a bang, but 
first it needs to find the bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are hoping to stage a fireworks display on the final day of the 
annual Founder's Day festivities June 24-26.But budget concerns and a $4,600 
price tag have kept the plans in check. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Ben Traina appealed to the community for donations to pay for the 
fireworks. Last year, the Chamber of Commerce, which used to pay for the show, 
eliminated it in favor of a street fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want the citizens of Lomita to have to go outside of the city for 
fireworks," Traina said. "I think a show would help bring the city together." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Traina said he has received $500 from the local Veterans of Foreign 
Wars post. If organizers fail to raise enough money to hold a show, Traina said 
the donations will be used for a display next year.  
</P>
<P>
 Lomita officials also revived another community event for this year's 
celebration: the Lomita Jim Thorpe 5K Run/Walk, which was cut in 1986 because 
it lost money. 
</P>
<P>
 More than $5,300 in donations from residents and businesses helped bring back 
the race, scheduled for June 26. The expected cost for the race is more than 
$5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the City Council said it would cover any race losses up to 
$1,000. Lawson Pedigo cast the lone dissenting vote, saying he objected to 
using city money to cover potential losses. SCOTT SANDELL

LAND PRESERVE: CLOSE PARTICIPANTS SHARE VIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many have urged me to write and correct the various mischaracterizations, 
misleading juxtapositions and other inaccuracies in Susan Woodward's May 5 
cover story regarding the recent preservation of the 28 1/2-acre Chandler 
Trusts property. Indeed, the reporter in question seems, unfortunately, to have 
either: a) been duped by a small group of longtime area naysayers into 
believing that there actually is a controversy surrounding the preservation of 
this land (something which is not the case, except perhaps in the 
all-too-imaginative minds of a few); or b) has chosen to ignore focusing on the 
far more important but perhaps less salacious news of the preservation of this 
land in favor of the easy appeal of a manufactured "controversy" (a temptation 
to which I hope Ms. Woodward did not succumb but one to which, sadly, many may, 
given her article, feel she did). 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, to focus on the article in question, even if merely to correct it, would 
take many words and risk missing that which is most profoundly important: the 
fact that dozens of people directly, and hundreds of others indirectly, worked 
long and hard to preserve many acres of valuable land as natural open space, 
something to be enjoyed by all forever. Thus, rather than criticize (the 
reporter), I hope everyone will instead both see and appreciate one of those 
rare and happy times when a group of people didn't just sit on the sidelines 
and complain or criticize but, instead, set out to do -- and actually did -- 
something constructive for the entire community. 
</P>
<P>
 It is this active handful, a relative few in any walk of life, who, with the 
support of the quiet majority, actually achieve positive results for everyone. 
And it is these people -- in this case the Chandler grandchildren and 
individuals at the city of Rolling Hills Estates and the Palos Verdes Land 
Conservancy -- who deserve both our accolades and those of the press. 
</P>
<P>
 I, for one, am both thankful for that relative minority of "doers" and am 
honored, in the case of the creation of the Linden H. Chandler Preserve, to 
have worked with them. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 I want to express our organization's disappointment with the recent article on 
the preservation of the Chandler Trust property in Rolling Hills Estates (May 
5). 
</P>
<P>
 We were disappointed for two reasons: First, our organization is run by 15 
well-known and respected members of the community -- volunteers who dedicate 
considerable time and talent to preserving open space. To imply, as your 
article did, that because one of our board members happens to be a developer, 
our organization is somehow planning an under-the-table deal to sell or trade 
the very land we have worked hard to preserve impugns the integrity of our 
organization and the individual involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, many volunteers worked for years to make this happen. Beginning with 
Sally Kinsey's effort in 1989, we worked hard to create the opportunity, we 
worked hard to raise the money and we worked hard to close the deal which 
finally preserved this beautiful site. We were hoping that The Times would 
print an article celebrating our community's accomplishment, an article 
congratulating all of the volunteers who made it possible, an article we would 
be proud to show our friends and relatives. Instead, based on incorrect 
information, you suggested a conspiracy to benefit a developer. Actually, the 
easement which is key to your conspiracy theory is not owned by the developer 
at all; it was acquired in 1991 by a neighbor who has restricted access to 
pedestrians and equestrians only. 
</P>
<P>
 The article made little mention of the preserve's dedication ceremony and the 
accolades the conservancy and the city received from elected officials 
including Rep. Jane Harman and Assemblywoman Betty Karnette. We dedicated a 
plaque that day which reads: "The Linden H. Chandler Preserve; preserved in 
perpetuity by the City of Rolling Hills Estates, the Palos Verdes Peninsula 
Land Conservancy, and the Eight Grandchildren of Linden H. Chandler." That 
plaque states the complete intentions of all involved in the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 We and the City of Rolling Hills Estates have done our best to insure that the 
Chandler Preserve will remain natural forever. We have established a special 
committee to develop a long-range management plan for the preserve, and a 
number of community leaders and environmentalists have agreed to help us make 
this a very special natural area. 
</P>
<P>
 We hope that members of our community who share the fears expressed in your 
article will become active in helping us to manage the preserve. We invite The 
Times to re-look at the issues involved and help us celebrate what our 
community has accomplished.

EDUCATION: SPENDING TAX DOLLARS ON SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I wish to respond to the current public outcry, and El Camino College faculty 
voting no confidence in the Board of Trustees of El Camino College and 
President Sam Schauerman (May 26). 
</P>
<P>
 I have taught full time as a professor of business administration at El Camino 
College for more than 14 years. Like most faculty, out of necessity, I spend a 
lot of my own money to improve the classes that I instruct. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino faculty and students are being denied the basic resources to teach 
in our classrooms. Faculty understand the cutbacks on the state level, but not 
the insensitive priorities of El Camino College upper-management 
administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, El Camino administrators recently allocated over $250,000 to 
expand even further an already bloated bureaucracy, adding new administrator 
positions; while district management is simultaneously and unilaterally cutting 
over 275 class sections in the fall! Anyone who knows even a little bit about 
the current El Camino College curriculum understands that current programs have 
already been decimated in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Faculty do not accept, nor do we agree to, the lack of respect afforded us by 
Sam Schauerman's administration. It is well known that Sam Schauerman controls 
a well-meaning, but ill-informed Board of Trustees who basically rubber-stamp 
anything Schauerman wants. The out-of-touch Board of Trustees previously met 
twice a month. However, now, with "nothing to do," they only meet monthly. 
</P>
<P>
 Faculty are fighting for much more than compensation. The issue is respect! 
Barely 50 cents of your education tax dollar is spent on the cost of 
instruction at El Camino College; the rest is spent on administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Faculty are right to be concerned for our students, for without the proper 
allocation of resources, or the respect of the administration, competent 
instruction is impossible. It is just plain wrong to spend 50 cents of every 
education tax dollar on administration!

 Sixty students in their early teens sitting in the Carson school library focus 
on their classmate standing at the front of the room, shushing anyone who dares 
to make a sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want you to hold me," Jabari Uko, 13, wails and then collapses against 
a woman's shoulder, sobbing. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, Jabari beams at the crowd, wiping tears from his cheek, looking 
like someone who just won a prize. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt good to get all the frustration out," Jabari tells the group. "I 
guess I was angry." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the exchange with Jabari, actress Sally Kirkland prompted him to 
focus on his feelings by saying to him: "I'm your mother. What do you need from 
me?" 
</P>
<P>
 By helping students at Glen Hammond Curtiss Junior High School tap into their 
emotions, Kirkland hopes to help them release some of their frustrations -- and 
maybe become good actors. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can actually use some of their own lives and turn it into art," Kirkland 
says. "Or they can turn this into just plain therapy and get it off of their 
chests." 
</P>
<P>
 Kirkland got hooked on coming to the school through the Achievement and 
Commitment to Excellence Program, a part of the nonprofit Educare Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1987, ACE has worked in more than 60 schools across the country. The 
program adopted Curtiss last fall, and since then has worked with school 
officials to create partnerships among businesses, community groups and the 
school. ACE officials estimate the group will work with Curtiss for at least 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Kirkland's eight acting workshops, ACE took 70 students to Soka 
University in Calabasas for a weekend retreat in March. They attended seminars 
on leadership skills and conflict resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also arranged the donation of a drum set for the school band and 
found a copying machine for teachers to use until the school's copier can be 
replaced. In a few weeks, ACE will oversee the installation of 12 to 15 stall 
doors in the boy's bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see ourselves as a support system to really meet the needs the schools 
have," says Stu Semigran, ACE's program director.  
</P>
<P>
 School Principal Bill Elkins says an equally important aspect of the program 
is that it boosts campus morale by showing students and faculty that people on 
the outside take an interest in them. 
</P>
<P>
 Through its leadership and self-esteem training, ACE also reinforces the 
themes the school staff promotes: be prompt and prepared for school, treat 
others as you want to be treated and do your best. 
</P>
<P>
 Elkins says Kirkland's sessions serve as a reward for students who stick to 
these principles. As Elkins describes it, if you don't measure up, you don't 
participate. Even Kirkland's manner during the sessions bolsters the school's 
emphasis on courtesy and respect, Elkins says. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is very demanding in the sense that she doesn't allow any side talk. That 
reinforces the kind of expectations we have for our kids -- the sense that they 
are here for business," Elkins says. 
</P>
<P>
 But taking care of business doesn't mean they don't have fun. With Kirkland 
circling the room trying to engage even the shyest students in the activities, 
the noise level is a controlled roar. 
</P>
<P>
 When she asks for attention she gets it, but there's plenty of time spent 
singing along and dancing to rapper Hammer's "2 Legit to Quit." One student 
leads the dancing and the rest try to mimic the moves, with Kirkland and other 
professional actors in her group joining in. 
</P>
<P>
 All ninth-graders interested in acting or entertainment could attend the 
two-hour workshops. Teachers' approval is required for participation, and this 
is based on the student's citizenship and academics, which must be 
satisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
 "That doesn't mean getting all A's," Elkins says. "It means doing the best 
they can."

REGIONAL REPORT; MANHATTAN BEACH; OFFICIALS PUT THE BRAKES ON SKATEBOARDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Zak Rangwala and Paul da Costalove to skateboard on Manhattan Beach's 
challenging downtown sidewalks, but they may be skating on thin concrete.  
</P>
<P>
 With the wind in their hair and the rush of pavement under their feet, the 
South Bay teen-agers frequently jump on their boards to brave the bumpy blue 
tiles and dodge weekend strollers. 
</P>
<P>
 But soon they might also get cited by police. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials recently posted signs banning skateboarders from the area. In 
response to merchants' complaints over sidewalk surfers, the City Council voted 
unanimously last month to exclude them from downtown sidewalks and much of 
Manhattan Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It reeks," says Billy Peretti, an eighth-grader at Manhattan Beach 
Intermediate School. The new law takes aim at Peretti's main set of wheels, his 
only transportation between school and work several miles away.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's bogus, plain and simple," says Mark John Hayes, 20, a Manhattan Beach 
surfer who cruises area streets on his skateboard when the wind-whipped waves 
turn bad. "What else do kids have to do?" 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say the skateboarders can take their fun elsewhere. The new 
law, which also bans skateboarders from city parking lots, is designed to 
protect pedestrians and parked cars from freewheeling skateboarders. Hermosa 
Beach has a similar law. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say the boards sometimes shoot out from under skaters' feet to dent 
cars or hit strollers. Since the law took effect about two weeks ago, police 
have issued only warnings, but eventually violators will be fined $100 to $200, 
said City Atty. Tim McOsker. 
</P>
<P>
 That's good news to many merchants and pedestrians. Tom Scalzo, a well-tanned 
Manhattan Beach man, says he's seen plenty of near-misses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's only a matter of time before some kid would nail some old lady," says 
Scalzo, 33. But many skateboarders say Manhattan Beach's new law is too broad, 
punishing all skateboarders when only a handful skate dangerously. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Zucker, 24, who owns the Ocean Gear surf shop in downtown Manhattan 
Beach, says many area skateboarders hang out outside his shop, sometimes 
practicing "curb grinds" along the nearby sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has received a few complaints, Zucker says the skateboarders 
outside his shop are considerate of passersby. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids could be out vandalizing," he says.

REGIONAL REPORT; SOUTH BAY; CHEMICAL REACTION; DISCOVERY OF DDT IN THE BACK 
YARDS OF TWO LOCAL HOMES HAS REKINDLED CONCERN AND FEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At first, federal officials spoke cautiously about the white chunks unearthed 
in a South Bay back yard. This mysterious material, they said, could be 
something as harmless as construction debris. 
</P>
<P>
 But just to make sure, they shipped a few clumps to a laboratory for testing. 
And on the May morning after the results came back, the white chunks were 
suddenly a hot news story. 
</P>
<P>
 Television vans jammed the alley leading to the excavation site. Reporters 
took turns holding up a vial of the material as cameras zoomed in. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a startling find: DDT had been dug from the yard of an unsuspecting 
couple on West 204th Street in the Harbor Gateway area of Los Angeles. No one 
-- not the residents, not their neighbors, not even the experts at the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency -- could say where it came from. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary. Stuff like this should not be happening. This is the 20th 
Century," said Robin Hatch, 30, a mother of two who lives only three doors from 
where the DDT was found. 
</P>
<P>
 Chunks of DDT as big as bowling balls simply are not supposed to be buried in 
yards where one resident grew tomatoes and another held family barbecues. In a 
society that has grown ever more wary of pesticides -- even to the point of 
diligently scrubbing its organic vegetables -- the back-yard discovery on West 
204th Street seems like an American nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials say they have no evidence that the chunks came from a DDT 
factory once located nearby. Yet the drama is a disconcerting reminder that 
DDT's legacy looms large in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, federal officials and consultants have been quietly measuring the 
DDT content of neighborhood soil, attic dust, ground water, storm drains and 
even crabs and fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Their mission: to analyze the effects of the DDT manufacturing plant operated 
by Montrose Chemical Corp. from 1947 to 1982 on Normandie Avenue, just east of 
Torrance in Harbor Gateway. 
</P>
<P>
 The task resembles some long but engrossing detective novel, with numerous 
plot twists and many chapters still unwritten. It illustrates the Gargantuan 
job that government agencies, companies and residents confront as they try to 
identify and clean up industrial pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 Montrose became one of the world's leading DDT producers in an era when the 
white powder was hailed as a magic potion. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Americans' enthusiasm for the pesticide cooled, Montrose's fortunes 
faltered. Today, the former factory site is one of 1,200 on the federal 
Superfund list of the most hazardous toxic-waste sites in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Its impact has been felt far beyond the 13-acre site, now a vacant lot. 
Thousands of pounds of DDT are trapped in sediment inside a local sewer line, 
and still more pollutes water underground. 
</P>
<P>
 Health experts emphasize that although DDT is a suspected carcinogen and, in 
large doses, can affect the human nervous system, most deposits detected around 
the Montrose site are too small to threaten human health. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, there are only a few routes by which residents could be exposed to 
the DDT, health officials say. Contaminated soil could be eaten by children. 
Adults could consume home-grown produce sprinkled with tainted soil or eat 
DDT-laden eggs laid by back-yard chickens. People could ingest attic dust, 
which experts say is unlikely. Or they could eat DDT-contaminated fish, which 
is one reason the state recommends against eating white croaker caught at 
places such as White's Point and Los Angeles Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Government experts say they have no evidence that such exposure has caused 
health problems in the area. Still, some residents wonder if the pesticide 
could be the source of the rashes, nausea, dizziness and aching joints that 
they say are prevalent in the West 204th Street neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The outpouring of public concern in recent weeks has lent new urgency to the 
ongoing federal studies of how DDT affected the South Bay environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Montrose's neighbors say they just want the government to hurry in its cleanup 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just hurting human beings. It's hurting our planet," Hatch said. "I 
want them to have whoever is responsible clean it up."  
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the 14-year-old federal Superfund program is supposed to be 
exactly that: to pinpoint which companies polluted a site and require them to 
investigate and, as much as possible, finance the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 At Montrose, the scope of that project is enormous. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, Montrose and its insurance companies have spent at least $17 million 
for studies and initial remediation, and that's only the beginning. A Montrose 
study estimates that cleanup costs for ground water alone could range from $30 
million to $359 million. And although the Montrose site was first proposed as a 
Superfund candidate in 1984, an overall cleanup plan has yet to begin or even 
be announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Montrose says it broke no laws and notes that industrial practices changed 
over the past several decades. Throughout, the firm did its best to operate 
within industry norms and follow legal requirements, said attorney Karl S. Lytz 
of Latham & Watkins, a law firm representing Montrose. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, despite years of costly studies and legal haggling, no one can say 
when the South Bay's DDT inheritance will be cleaned up for good. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after DDT was banned for most uses in the United States in 1972, Montrose 
continued making it for export to Africa, India and elsewhere. By the late 
1970s, the South Bay plant was the only American DDT plant still operating. It 
finally shut down in June, 1982, and the building was torn down soon after. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the environmental drama was just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators concluded that rainwater had carried some DDT from the plant 
into the storm drains. Montrose installed an asphalt cap over much of the 
property, and testing continued. 
</P>
<P>
 The site officially attained Superfund status in 1989. By then, monitoring 
wells had detected ground water tainted with monochlorobenzene, a chemical used 
in DDT manufacturing that can cause liver and kidney damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The testing went on, unnoticed by many residents living nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the trouble started on West 204th Street, and DDT again became a 
household word in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 It was almost by happenstance that DDT was spotted in the back-yard soil. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA was screening soil from 14 yards along West 204th Street to make sure 
it was not tainted by chemicals from the proposed Del Amo Superfund site to the 
north, where a synthetic rubber factory once operated. 
</P>
<P>
 With Montrose in mind, an agency official decided to add a test for DDT. When 
the tests came back last winter, Del Amo chemicals were barely detectable -- 
but DDT showed up in samples from two back yards on the street's north side. 
More tests, taken beneath the surface in the two yards, found the pesticide at 
45 times the level considered safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Frightened residents formed a committee and fought successfully to have 25 
families temporarily moved to hotels while federal crews removed toxic soil and 
took it to a hazardous-waste landfill in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleanup was supposed to take only two weeks, but a glitch developed May 6 when 
workers uncovered the first of the DDT chunks. In response, EPA officials 
agreed three weeks ago to keep residents in temporary housing for up to six 
months during an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The DDT deposits appear to be scattered in fill soil that goes as deep as 
seven feet in one back yard. Investigators now hope to trace where the fill 
came from -- and determine if it extends under homes to the east of the two 
excavated yards. 
</P>
<P>
 That probe, which could last through the summer, will help decide how much 
cleanup is needed and if residents should be permanently relocated. That would 
be an unusual step -- taken only once before in the EPA's four-state Western 
region -- but one that the agency has promised to study. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't necessarily think there's an acute health risk out there," said 
Nancy Lindsay, chief of the Superfund enforcement branch for the EPA regional 
office in San Francisco. Although residents can choose to return to West 204th 
Street during the investigation, gardening or even allowing children to play in 
their own back yards is not advised. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly four weeks after the discovery of the first DDT chunks, the EPA says it 
is still perplexed about how they got there. 
</P>
<P>
 Montrose's attorney says he is not aware that the DDT came from Montrose. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no idea of where the material came from," attorney Lytz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the uncertainty, the federal government is not charging Montrose 
for the back-yard cleanup. The cost to date: more than $500,000.  
</P>
<P>
 For many neighbors, an underground soup of monochlorobenzene and talk of 
60-year timelines to clean it up are simply too colossal to dwell upon. Much 
more immediate -- and more alarming -- are the white chunks of DDT. For many, 
that simple image has poisoned the sense of security that once characterized 
their neighborhood. Now they worry less about cleanup schemes than about how to 
avoid returning to West 204th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunia Ponce feels like a fool for having ever bought her two-bedroom house 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked very hard to buy my American dream," said Ponce, 33, a registered 
nurse. "I know it's not a mansion, a palace. But it's everything to me."

EDUCATION: HOOKED ON PHONICS ISN'T AS DIFFICULT AS IT MAY SOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LAINE YARBER, Mary Laine Yarber teaches English at Santa Monica High 
School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a recent column about the importance of learning phonics (a method of 
learning the sounds associated with alphabet letters) to improve reading 
skills, I recommended the Hooked on Phonics program as a supplement to 
classroom study. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, I've been deluged with questions from people who are interested in 
buying the program for their children but first want to know what it entails. 
</P>
<P>
 Such research is wise because the Hooked on Phonics package's $229 price is a 
hefty sum for many parents. 
</P>
<P>
 I can't tell you whether the program is right for your child or your budget -- 
but I can certainly tell you what's in the box. 
</P>
<P>
 Pop the lid of the kit and you may be intimidated by the many components, 
bright colors, busy pictures and instructions chart. I opened my kit, took one 
wide-eyed look, then put it off until after lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 But once I dug in, I found that the instructions were easy. 
</P>
<P>
 The program consists of two parts: Hooked on Phonics, which teaches basic 
sounding-out of words and brief sentences, and Your Reading Power, which 
polishes comprehension and analysis of longer passages and stories. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hooked on Phonics portion must be completed first and is made up of 
coordinated workbooks, cassette tapes and flash cards. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also an instruction booklet and cassette tape, which are reasonably 
clear, although I had to rewind a couple of times to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
 A student-progress booklet and about 75 colorful achievement stickers -- such 
as "Super!" "You're on the Right Track!" "Doggone Good!" and "You're Number 
One!" -- are also included. 
</P>
<P>
 The child listens to a cassette tape while following along in a book in order 
to hear the correct pronunciation of the letters and words. Each workbook is 
about 100 pages long and targets a particular category of letter sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Book 1 tackles the sounds of each alphabet letter, along with short vowel and 
consonant sounds. Sounds that are generally found at the beginning or ending of 
words are taught in Book 2. Book 3 continues with beginning and ending sounds, 
then progresses to long vowels and other sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Diphthongs and other related sounds are featured in Book 4, along with more 
vowel and combination sounds. Book 5 hits combination sounds and silent 
letters, and prefixes and silent letters. Suffixes and silent letters and other 
related sounds are covered in Book 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Book 7, the Reading Review Book, gives the child plenty of practice 
on concepts from the preceding books. 
</P>
<P>
 All the books include color illustrations, reviews and exercises. 
</P>
<P>
 If matching the cassettes with the right book and stack of flash cards sounds 
chaotic, don't worry. Every component is color-coded, so your child will be 
able to pick the right materials and start a study session without your help. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost everyone who has asked about the Hooked on Phonics program wants to 
know how long it takes to complete. My answer is inherently sketchy: speed 
depends largely on your child's age, amount of motivation, and frequency and 
length of study sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the child has finished the program, you can send in an enclosed coupon to 
receive a personalized certificate of completion. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he or she moves on to the second half of the overall Hooked on Phonics 
program, Your Reading Power. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a home-use version of the Science Research Associates reading 
comprehension program, which has been widely praised and used in the primary 
grades.  
</P>
<P>
 I used it every day for several years and will be forever thankful; it's the 
reason I can immediately notice and remember the salient points in any reading. 
</P>
<P>
 Your Reading Power contains 100 typed and illustrated selections that range 
from short passages to longer stories, and four cassette tapes that narrate 
them. The child reads a story while listening to it, then answers questions 
about it in the "student record book." 
</P>
<P>
 The passages and stories progress in difficulty from first grade through high 
school. They're color-coded to indicate reading level. 
</P>
<P>
 As with the Hooked on Phonics portion of the program, Your Reading Power 
includes an instruction tape and booklet. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, a first glance at the size and number of components of the whole Hooked 
on Phonics package may seem cumbersome. 
</P>
<P>
 But the instructions and exercises are interesting, thorough, academically 
sound -- even enjoyable. And after about half an hour of studying the 
directions, everything will make sense. 
</P>

BIKE PATH: LETTING WALKERS AND BICYCLISTS SHARE THE SCENIC ROUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 21.6 miles of bike path featured in the May 19 Westside section is exactly 
the same 14-foot width from Pacific Palisades to Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1.5-mile segment in Pacific Palisades, however, has a designated walker 
path included in that width. Then, the walker portion is arbitrarily painted 
away and the bike path is suddenly expanded. I have often wondered why this is 
so. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not extend the walker portion for the full length of the path? Then 
everyone would travel single file in peace and order.

QUAKES: REVEALING ANOTHER SEISMIC DANGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every earthquake reveals a new problem. The Northridge quake exposed one with 
steel-framed structures. The concern of experts and the city and state with 
this problem is reassuring. 
</P>
<P>
 What good, though, is knowledge that goes unused? I continue waiting to hear 
word one about the No. 1 quake danger of the Westside: the thousands of 
pre-Sylmar multistory wood-frame apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1971 quake exposed the weaknesses of multistory wood-frame apartments, as 
then built. The city imposed additional requirements for new construction but 
did nothing to strengthen existing buildings, as it did for unreinforced 
masonry structures. The wood-frame apartment problem showed up again in the 
Marina District of San Francisco. Those units also revealed a special problem 
of buckling and collapse in buildings with open first-floor garages and 
carports. In Northridge, the same problem appeared again. Unlike the Marina 
apartments, in which the first floors contained only parking areas, the 
Northridge units had both living units and parking spaces on the first floor. 
When the buildings buckled and collapsed, people, not just cars, were trapped 
and crushed. 
</P>
<P>
 The known seismic faults on this side of the mountain could generate a quake 
as strong, if not stronger, than the Northridge temblor. Such a quake would be 
even more deadly because of older, un-retrofitted, multistory, open 
first-floor, wood-frame apartment buildings here. 
</P>
<P>
 After three straight urban quakes demonstrating the danger to life of 
wood-frame apartments, retrofitting remains a non-issue at City Hall and in 
Sacramento. How many Westsiders must die next time before our elected 
representatives realize that un-retrofitted wood-frame apartments, like the 
masonry units, pose an unacceptable risk of death?

MEDIA: PROS AND CONS OF NEW WESTSIDE FORMAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My husband and I applaud the new Westside format. We find increased in-depth 
coverage of Westside issues, events and individuals.The cover photographs lead 
us into the centerfold feature story, which now receives more column space. We 
now think of Westside as a local, twice-weekly magazine.

 Why fix (it) if it ain't broke? Your new Westside (section) is AWFUL. (It's) 
hard to find the things about the Westside one likes to read. It looks like a 
small-town news sheet. Your old format was quite interesting.

VOTE LEAVES POLICE SEEKING NEW FUNDING RESOURCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Declaring "a gloomy day" in Port Hueneme, police and city officials on 
Wednesday began looking for a new strategy to fund the Police Department after 
voters defeated a ballot measure to assess an annual fee on residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Oak Park, an advisory vote against cityhood prompted dismay but 
not concession of defeat in at least one supporter, who said the measure could 
come back to life if the area's incoming county supervisor fails to heed the 
concerns of the small, unincorporated community. 
</P>
<P>
 The two proposals were among four local and nine statewide ballot measures 
that Ventura County voters considered on Tuesday. Countywide, voters 
overwhelmingly passed a measure to spend public transportation funds on 
commuter rail. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Paula, voters approved a measure to increase property taxes to buy 
new library books and keep the doors open longer. 
</P>
<P>
 But on statewide bond issues, Ventura County voters mirrored California, 
defeating the measures that would cost them money. Voters here turned down a 
parklands measure that would have brought more than $50 million to Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 They also voted down a measure that would have funneled $10 million to Ventura 
County Community College District's three campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 In Port Hueneme, Measure Z would have cost residents $56 a year as homeowners 
or $47 a year as renters. Police Chief John Hopkins said he was disappointed 
because he had believed the measure enjoyed strong support in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of upset and disappointed people around here today," he said. 
"It's a gloomy day." 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the ballot measure would have made up the $500,000 deficit needed 
to pay for the city's 26-member police force.  
</P>
<P>
 Officer Steve Hart said he appreciated the community's support. "There's a 
little bit of stress involved, this unknowing feeling," said Hart, a three-year 
veteran. "Whatever happens, I'll still do the best job." 
</P>
<P>
 But City Manager Richard Velthoen said he will recommend to City Council 
members next week that they impose a utilities tax to save the department. 
Unlike Tuesday's ballot measure, which was passed by 64.6% of the voters but 
came just short of garnering the required two-thirds support, a utilities tax 
would not need voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering the impressive support the measure had, there is a good chance 
the council could approve a utility tax," Velthoen said. "A minority of the 
people dictated the opposite of what almost two-thirds of the people wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Other options to save the department include cutting other General Fund 
expenses by reducing hours at the community center, and cutting back on life 
guards or general maintenance in the city, Velthoen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other scenarios include contracting for services with the Ventura County 
Sheriff's Department or signing a joint powers agreement with Oxnard that would 
allow Oxnard Police to patrol neighboring Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 In the tiny community of Oak Park, David Ross, a former Municipal Advisory 
Council member and supporter of cityhood, complained that many of his neighbors 
are complacent, at least until a problem arises with county services. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, if the new supervisor who takes office after the first of the 
year is unsympathetic to the community's needs, that could help resurrect the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have to see how our new supervisor treats Oak Park," Ross said. "If the 
supervisor treats us nice, the issue is dead. And if the supervisor treats us 
nasty, there may be interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross also said Measure A, which was sponsored by Supervisor Maria VanderKolk, 
may turn out to have been a waste of time and money. 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk was in New York and unavailable for comment, but her administrative 
assistant, Doug Johnson, said the supervisor felt the time and money were 
well-spent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time the public is given the opportunity to decide which way they want to 
go, that's not a waste of time, that's a democracy," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the county, supporters of the two successful local measures were 
more upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It continues my faith in the community of Santa Paula," said Dan Robles, 
director of the Blanchard Community Library, of the resounding success of 
Measure Y, which was approved by 83.7% of the voters. "It will be the first 
year in 17 years that we'll have money to make library services better. I'm 
anxious to get started." 
</P>
<P>
 The first $25 assessment will appear on December property tax bills, and 
Robles said he hopes that will translate to longer library hours beginning Jan. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters approved another measure that would allow the county to tap a special 
state gas-tax fund to bring $1.2 million annually to the county to pay for mass 
transit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're absolutely delighted," said Ginger Gherardi, executive director of the 
Ventura County Transportation Commission. Commission Chairwoman Vicki Howard 
called Measure X a "no-risk proposition" that enables the county to "develop 
innovative transportation programs that will benefit Ventura County's air 
quality." 
</P>
<P>
 The funds can be used to help build rail or bus stations or buy new rail cars 
or buses. 
</P>
<P>
 But proponents of the parks and wild lands initiative were disappointed on 
Wednesday by voters' defeat of Proposition 180. 
</P>
<P>
 More than $50 million was slated to come to Ventura County through the 
initiative to fund river restorations, bike and hiking trails and the purchase 
of open space. The largest chunk of that was designated for the Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy, which had planned to acquire another 2,000 acres or more 
of park lands in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a time for reassessment on staffing and other things, but we'll be 
working as hard as we can to keep our mission going," said Rorie Skei, 
assistant executive officer of the Mountains Recreation and Conservation 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will not be big land acquisitions, but we will work on keeping our 
programs going and managing the properties that we have," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett Millais, director of community development for the city of Ventura, 
said the city will try to find other sources to fund the planned Ventura River 
Bike Trail to connect an existing beachfront trail with the Ojai Valley Trail. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said projects such as the restoration of the Ventura River, beyond the 
initial phase that is already funded, and developing the Seaside Wilderness 
Park at the river estuary will be put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 He said voters did not want to part with more tax dollars during tough 
economic times. "It's not a rejection of the project, but of the funding," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Community College District Trustee Pete Tafoya echoed 
sentiments of disappointment Wednesday after the defeat of Proposition 1C, 
which would have funded capital projects in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously there are a number of projects that are in significant jeopardy," 
he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The district had planned to make earthquake repairs at the Moorpark College 
campus library and at other buildings in the district. Plans were under way to 
build a new Letters and Science Building in Oxnard. And the district wanted to 
refurbish some of the old buildings on the Ventura Campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without this proposition, I don't know what we're going to do," Tafoya said. 
"It appears that the state would tend to freeze projects. It's a pretty gloomy 
picture." 
</P>

OJAI VALLEY RESIDENTS HELP VICTIMS OF FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Donations poured in Wednesday for a black family whose Ojai Valley home was 
destroyed by fire Tuesday, but investigators said they are moving cautiously in 
determining whether the blaze was deliberately set. 
</P>
<P>
 While still looking at the fire as a possible arson, investigators said they 
plan to re-interview members of the family to try to resolve differences 
between the witnesses' account of the blaze and physical evidence gathered at 
the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire patterns don't match up with what the witnesses are stating," said 
Nina Raya, a spokeswoman for the Ventura County Fire Department. "What 
(investigators) are doing right now is re-evaluating the witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to make sure they're telling the truth," she said, adding that 
investigators so far have not ruled out any possible cause of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Wednesday, an FBI agent interviewed at least one of the victims. The 
FBI's involvement came after a call by the Ventura County NAACP on Tuesday to 
investigate potential civil rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
 The agent declined to discuss details of the interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Lonnie Stanford, a 30-year Navy veteran who now works for the federal 
Department of Veterans Affairs, and other members of his family said they are 
convinced that the fire -- which injured three people -- was an arson attack 
motivated by racial hatred. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't prove anything, but holes don't get there by themselves," said 
Stanford, who told investigators Tuesday there was a hole in the living room 
window moments before the fire engulfed his house. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I know is (the fire) didn't start in the house," said Winnie Stanford, 
Lonnie Stanford's wife, who was treated for smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the discrepancies cited by arson investigators, Stanford said: "I'm not 
a fire inspector. All we're doing is saying what we saw, and we hope they can 
determine what really went on." 
</P>
<P>
 Property owner Robert M. Featherston, a former insurance company investigator 
for 12 years, also said the fire was deliberately set. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out," said Featherston, who 
on Tuesday was one of the first people to offer the family help. "I knew it was 
a hate crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Featherston, who was rummaging through the burned-out home with his insurance 
adjuster Wednesday morning, added: "I think someone threw a Molotov cocktail 
through the window, and I think it was racial."  
</P>
<P>
 The American Red Cross has relocated the Stanfords to a motel until the family 
finds a temporary place to live. But the Stanfords vowed Wednesday to help 
rebuild the charred home on Grande Vista Street in the unincorporated community 
of Oak View -- a house they said they hope to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Regardless of race, creed, sex, religion or national origin, all individuals 
have the right to feel free to live as they choose in society," Lonnie Stanford 
said. "We'll have to stand up. People of conscience will have to stand up 
also." 
</P>
<P>
 While investigators were trying to determine the cause of the fire, donations 
of cash and clothing for the family were arriving at a number of Ojai Valley 
firehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 sacks of clothing had been dropped off at fire stations by 
Wednesday evening. Typical of the cash donations was a $100 bill that an 
unidentified man handed to Fire Investigator Norman Plott. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just amazed at the public response," Plott said. "The generosity has been 
unbelievable." An account to receive donations for the victims has been opened 
at the Ojai Valley Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze, which caused $150,000 in damage and destroyed virtually all of the 
family's belongings, broke out about 4 a.m. Tuesday near the living room of the 
single-story, three-bedroom house. Family members said they first heard "a big 
pop," then discovered flames roiling through the house. 
</P>
<P>
 But a search by a trained dog failed to sniff out incendiary devices or other 
potential sources of fuel, in part prompting investigators to re-examine the 
Stanfords' statements. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze occurred within a few weeks of a request by 13-year-old Shuwana 
Stanford to graduate with her former classmates at Matilija Junior High School 
in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuwana withdrew from courses in January in favor of a home-schooling program 
after she was targeted by a series of racial threats at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Matilija Principal James Berube said many of his students knew that Shuwana 
planned to attend the commencement exercise but added that "students didn't 
seem to care" if she participated or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 300 students going through (the ceremony), and it's special to all of 
them," Berube said. "Shuwana is hopefully a part of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Shuwana, the most seriously injured, with first- and second-degree burns on 
her head and face, said Wednesday that she is still determined to graduate with 
her class on June 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a part of my life," she said. "It'll show them that I'm not afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 At nearby Nordhoff High School, students and faculty on Wednesday were 
organizing a relief effort and clothing drive to help the Stanfords. Shuwana's 
cousin Keyana, who also was roused by the fire, is a sophomore at Nordhoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a large outpouring of concern and the desire to do something," 
said Nordhoff Principal Michael Maez. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai officials on Wednesday expressed concern over the fire and its potential 
impact on the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want anyone to think Ojai is a place where people are not accepted 
because of color," said Councilwoman Nina V. Shelley, who sent a get-well note 
to Shuwana on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want the city's image destroyed," Shelley said.

TWO D.A. WORKERS CLEARED OF EAVESDROPPING CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge accused by prosecutors of being too lenient dismissed 
charges against two defendants Wednesday -- but this time even the district 
attorney's office cheered the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Lawrence Storch dropped the charges against two of Dist. 
Atty. Michael D. Bradbury's own employees, deputy prosecutor Stacy A. Ratner 
and investigator Katherine Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 The state attorney general's office charged Ratner and Smith with 
eavesdropping on May 20, after they allegedly listened in on a conversation 
between a burglary defendant and his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 In a news release, the attorney general's office said it is considering an 
appeal of Storch's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's ruling comes seven weeks after Bradbury ordered Ratner and other 
prosecutors in the county to disqualify Storch from hearing new criminal cases. 
Prosecutors can remove a judge from a case by swearing that the jurist is 
biased against them. 
</P>
<P>
 Public Defender Kenneth I. Clayman said it was ironic that the judge accused 
of bias against the district attorney's office ended up dismissing charges 
against two of its members. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would imagine they are going to take another look at their policy," Clayman 
said. "They've got to realize that they've got a judge who is not 
discriminating against them." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bradbury has not specifically stated why he ordered Storch removed 
from hearing new criminal cases, he has in the past called the judge overly 
lenient. Bradbury's office also has cited a case in which Storch reduced the 
conviction of a Newbury Park man from first-degree murder to second-degree 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin J. McGee said prosecutors are pleased with the 
judge's decision in the Ratner-Smith case. Nonetheless, they plan to continue 
disqualifying Storch from criminal cases, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two matters are totally unrelated," McGee said. 
</P>
<P>
 The eavesdropping case marked the first time any prosecutor or investigator in 
the county has been charged with a felony, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratner and Smith have been on paid administrative leave since being charged 
but will return to work today, McGee said. 
</P>
<P>
 In dismissing the charges on Wednesday, Storch agreed with defense attorneys 
that California's eavesdropping law, enacted in 1967, is ambiguous. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, a person commits eavesdropping by using an electronic or 
mechanical device to listen in on a conversation. Harland W. Braun and Stuart 
B. Adams, attorneys for Ratner and Smith, asked Storch to drop the charges 
because neither was accused of using such a device. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratner and Smith were charged with eavesdropping on a conversation between 
burglary defendant Robert Lee Morrow and his attorney, Deputy Public Defender 
Mary Fielder. 
</P>
<P>
 In court Wednesday, Deputy Atty. Gen. Robert Ottinger told Storch that Ratner 
and Smith broke the law even without using an electronic or mechanical device. 
Law enforcement officials cannot eavesdrop on a conversation between suspects 
and their attorneys even if they don't use such devices, he argued. 
</P>
<P>
 Ottinger left the courthouse without commenting on Storch's decision. But in a 
news release, the attorney general's office said: "If this ruling stands, the 
Attorney General will likely propose legislation to correct any perceived 
ambiguity in the law, so that eavesdropping on private conversations between a 
lawyer and a client, priest and penitent or doctor and patient in in-custody 
settings is strictly forbidden under California law."  
</P>
<P>
 Despite his ruling, Judge Storch said he believes it is inappropriate -- and 
in some cases illegal -- for law enforcement officers to eavesdrop on suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Ratner-Smith case would be better handled administratively either by 
the court, the State Bar of California or the defendants' superiors, Storch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayman agreed, even though his office has asked for the burglary charge to be 
dropped against Morrow because of the alleged eavesdropping incident. A judge 
is scheduled to rule on that request today. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly did not initiate charges, and would never take any pleasure in 
seeing any lawyer charged," Clayman said.

TATUM NAMED PRINCIPAL AT OXNARD HIGH SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oxnard Union High School District has named one of its most popular 
administrators to head Oxnard High School, where the current principal resigned 
under pressure from some teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Daisy Tatum will take over from Rick Rezinas as principal at the school at the 
end of this school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Known for her good rapport with both students and teachers, Tatum, 49, will 
face the tasks of uniting a divided faculty and moving the school's 2,400 
students in January from Oxnard High's 5th Street campus to a new building on 
Gonzales Road. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tatum, who will be Ventura County's first black female high school 
principal, said she is up to the challenge. And she said she is thrilled to 
return to the same school she graduated from 32 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm just excited because I'm going back to my high school." 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate of the University of Arkansas, Tatum joined the Oxnard district in 
1969 as a physical education teacher at Channel Islands High School. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1974, she became a vice principal at Channel Islands and has since held 
various administrative jobs, making her the second longest-serving 
administrator in the district. Only Hueneme High School Assistant Principal Jim 
Miller has more administrative experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the long record of service, Tatum had been passed over twice in her 
bid to become a principal. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, her application to head Hueneme High School, where she had served as 
assistant principal since 1980, was turned down in favor of Terry Taylor. When 
Taylor became ill and unable to serve in 1992, the district again passed over 
Tatum. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite protests from parents, teachers and students, district officials named 
Joanne Black to run Hueneme High and appointed Tatum as principal of the 
district's continuation high school and independent-study programs. 
</P>
<P>
 District Supt. Bill Studt said Wednesday that Tatum had needed more experience 
working with school curriculum issues, experience that she gained during her 
past 1 1/2 years at Frontier Continuation High. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is Tatum's talents as a consensus builder that district officials said 
they are counting on when she moves to Oxnard High. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she'll be able to pull the staff of Oxnard High together," Studt 
said. "I think she'll be able to provide a focus for the school." 
</P>
<P>
 Tatum will be the third principal at Oxnard in the past seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 The district hired Rezinas three years ago after the school was rocked by a 
violent brawl between black and Latino students. Rezinas replaced Ruperto 
Cisneros, who had served in the position three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Rezinas' leadership, Oxnard won a $116,400 state grant to revamp its 
curriculum to enhance learning. But some of Rezinas' specific ideas for 
restructuring the school ran into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 His plan to put Oxnard High on a year-round calendar sparked heated opposition 
from parents and some teachers, leading district officials to scuttle the 
proposal. And other restructuring proposals from the principal also caused 
controversy among school staff, according to parent leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Rezinas has accepted a position as principal at Rancho Cordova High School 
outside Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Oxnard teachers said Wednesday they expect Tatum to bring positive 
changes to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am just excited about the change," veteran swim coach and science teacher 
Larry Raffaelli said. "I think its going to improve morale." 
</P>
<P>
 Tatum won the position at Oxnard over four other finalists, including three 
from inside the district. The board approved her by a 4-1 vote, with Trustee 
Janet Lindgren the lone dissenter. Lindgren could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But board President Nancy Koch said she chose Tatum because of Tatum's 
commitment to helping students in all aspects of their high school experience 
-- academically, personally and socially. 
</P>
<P>
 "She really is somebody who students, high school kids, relate to," Koch said. 
"We've known that all along." 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Tatum said she tries only to treat high school students with 
respect. 
</P>
<P>
 School administrators need to remember, Tatum said, that each student is an 
individual. "And that person has goals and that person has dreams. You want to 
try to help them to hold on to their dreams."

ECONOMIST SAYS AREA'S RECOVERY IS SLOWING; ECONOMY: HE CONTENDS IT WILL TAKE 
YEARS FOR THE COUNTY TO RETURN TO PRE-RECESSION LEVELS. JOB LOSSES AND 
MIGRATION ARE BLAMED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Job losses in manufacturing, coupled with migration of the county's richest 
population groups, are slowing down Ventura County's economic recovery, a UC 
Santa Barbara economist said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 About 230 county business men and women at a seminar in Westlake listened as 
Mark Schniepp, director of the UCSB Economic Forecast Project, used words such 
as "modest" and "austere" to describe the county's recovery from the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Using slides, Schniepp showed a series of bar charts illustrating aspects of 
the economy from average salaries to high technology employment, nearly all 
creeping steadily downward or barely holding even. The number of durable 
manufacturing jobs in the county has fallen by 3,000 since 1990, to a current 
total of about 21,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schniepp did offer a glimmer of hope, saying true recovery should start this 
summer, judging by building permits, gains in auto sales and growth in service 
industries. But he said the rebound will be slow and it will take at least four 
years for Ventura County to return to pre-recession levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Loss in manufacturing jobs is the principal reason," Schniepp said. "We just 
hope other sectors can make up for it." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since 1948, more people are leaving Ventura County than 
moving in. While population continues to increase due to births, statistics 
show the numbers of residents in the 30-to-44 and 45-to-65 age groups dropping. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 30-to-44 population is usually growing, but now it's going down," 
Schniepp said. "That's a bit disturbing because that's your principal labor 
force." 
</P>
<P>
 The primary destinations for departing residents are Arizona, Nevada and 
Colorado, with Washington and Oregon a close second, he said. A moan rose from 
the audience when Schniepp put up a slide showing the dramatically growing 
number of jobs in Colorado -- the polar opposite to those he had shown for 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The departure of older residents has contributed heavily to a drop in the 
county's wealth, he said. Meanwhile, the number of people in the 18-to-29 age 
group is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
 Those people tend to fill lower-paying jobs in the service sector, one area 
that Schniepp said showed continued signs of growth despite the recession. But 
salaries in those fields remain low, he said. "We're not creating wealth the 
way we were," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business services and health care -- look for these industries to really be 
the leaders in creating jobs in the county in the next few years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One audience member, Thomas Becker, administrator at the Buenaventura Medical 
Clinic, said he was troubled by the outlook for health care, despite Schniepp's 
positive predictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little concerned," Becker said after Schniepp's presentation. "We're 
looking to an industry that is due for some serious changes under health-care 
reform for leadership" in job creation. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline in the older population also worries him, Becker said, because 
older residents are the biggest users of health care. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doom and gloom," Becker said, shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
 But James Cole, an attorney with the Ventura-based law firm Henderson & 
Wohlgemuth, said Schniepp's forecast had increased his optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be depressing, but it's certainly more encouraging than what we've 
heard in the last few years," Cole said. "Especially when you compare it to Los 
Angeles and Santa Barbara counties, that makes Ventura look a little better." 
</P>
<P>
 In straight number comparison, Ventura County has ridden out the recession 
more successfully than both Santa Barbara and Los Angeles counties. In 
high-technology jobs lost since April, 1990, Ventura County fared relatively 
well by comparison, losing 14.9% of its jobs, while Los Angeles County lost 
41.5% and Santa Barbara County 35.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 Schniepp said some of that difference may be attributed to the high number of 
east county residents who commute to Los Angeles County. Their job losses would 
register there rather than here, he said, but Ventura County feels the impact 
of those layoffs through diminished consumer spending. 
</P>
<P>
 The January earthquake has had a surprisingly small effect on the county's 
economy, he said. While building permits are up 41% from the first four months 
of 1993, Schniepp said construction jobs have not shown a net increase, 
dropping 5,100 since 1990.

OAK PARK CITYHOOD PLAN COULD COME BACK TO LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An advisory vote against Oak Park cityhood prompted dismay but not concession 
of defeat in at least one supporter, who said the measure could come back to 
life if the area's incoming county supervisor fails to heed the concerns of the 
small, unincorporated community. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Port Hueneme, police and city officials declared Wednesday "a 
gloomy day," but began seeking a new strategy to fund the city's Police 
Department after voters defeated a ballot measure to assess an annual fee on 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The two proposals were among four local and nine statewide ballot measures 
that Ventura County voters considered on Tuesday. Countywide, voters 
overwhelmingly passed a measure to spend public transportation funds on 
commuter rail. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Paula, voters approved a measure to increase property taxes to buy 
new library books and keep the doors open longer. 
</P>
<P>
 But on statewide bond issues, Ventura County voters mirrored California, 
defeating the measures that would cost them money. Voters here turned down a 
parklands measure that would have brought more than $50 million to Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 They also voted down a measure that would have funneled $10 million to Ventura 
County Community College District's three campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 In Port Hueneme, Measure Z would have cost residents $56 a year as homeowners 
or $47 a year as renters. Police Chief John Hopkins said he was disappointed 
because he had believed the measure enjoyed strong support in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of upset and disappointed people around here today," he said. 
"It's a gloomy day." 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the ballot measure would have made up the $500,000 deficit needed 
to pay for the city's 26-member police force.  
</P>
<P>
 Officer Steve Hart said he appreciated the community's support. "There's a 
little bit of stress involved, this unknowing feeling," said Hart, a three-year 
veteran. "Whatever happens, I'll still do the best job." 
</P>
<P>
 But City Manager Richard Velthoen said he will recommend to City Council 
members next week that they impose a utilities tax to save the department. 
Unlike Tuesday's ballot measure, which was passed by 64.6% of the voters but 
came just short of garnering the required two-thirds support, a utilities tax 
would not need voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering the impressive support the measure had, there is a good chance 
the council could approve a utility tax," Velthoen said. "A minority of the 
people dictated the opposite of what almost two-thirds of the people wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Other options to save the department include cutting other General Fund 
expenses by reducing hours at the community center, and cutting back on life 
guards or general maintenance in the city, Velthoen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other scenarios include contracting for services with the Ventura County 
Sheriff's Department or signing a joint powers agreement with Oxnard that would 
allow Oxnard Police to patrol neighboring Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 In the tiny community of Oak Park, David Ross, a former Municipal Advisory 
Council member and supporter of cityhood, complained that many of his neighbors 
are complacent, at least until a problem arises with county services. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, if the new supervisor who takes office after the first of the 
year is unsympathetic to the community's needs, that could help resurrect the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have to see how our new supervisor treats Oak Park," Ross said. "If the 
supervisor treats us nice, the issue is dead. And if the supervisor treats us 
nasty, there may be interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross also said Measure A, which was sponsored by Supervisor Maria VanderKolk, 
may turn out to have been a waste of time and money. 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk was in New York and unavailable for comment, but her administrative 
assistant, Doug Johnson, said the supervisor felt the time and money were 
well-spent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time the public is given the opportunity to decide which way they want to 
go, that's not a waste of time, that's a democracy," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the county, supporters of the two successful local measures were 
more upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It continues my faith in the community of Santa Paula," said Dan Robles, 
director of the Blanchard Community Library, of the resounding success of 
Measure Y, which was approved by 83.7% of the voters. "It will be the first 
year in 17 years that we'll have money to make library services better. I'm 
anxious to get started." 
</P>
<P>
 The first $25 assessment will appear on December property tax bills, and 
Robles said he hopes that will translate to longer library hours beginning Jan. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters approved another measure that would allow the county to tap a special 
state gas-tax fund to bring $1.2 million annually to the county to pay for mass 
transit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're absolutely delighted," said Ginger Gherardi, executive director of the 
Ventura County Transportation Commission. Commission Chairwoman Vicki Howard 
called Measure X a "no-risk proposition" that enables the county to "develop 
innovative transportation programs that will benefit Ventura County's air 
quality." 
</P>
<P>
 The funds can be used to help build rail or bus stations or buy new rail cars 
or buses. 
</P>
<P>
 But proponents of the parks and wild lands initiative were disappointed on 
Wednesday by voters' defeat of Proposition 180. 
</P>
<P>
 More than $50 million was slated to come to Ventura County through the 
initiative to fund river restorations, bike and hiking trails and the purchase 
of open space. The largest chunk of that was designated for the Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy, which had planned to acquire another 2,000 acres or more 
of park lands in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a time for reassessment on staffing and other things, but we'll be 
working as hard as we can to keep our mission going," said Rorie Skei, 
assistant executive officer of the Mountains Recreation and Conservation 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will not be big land acquisitions, but we will work on keeping our 
programs going and managing the properties that we have," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett Millais, director of community development for the city of Ventura, 
said the city will try to find other sources to fund the planned Ventura River 
Bike Trail to connect an existing beachfront trail with the Ojai Valley Trail. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said projects such as the restoration of the Ventura River, beyond the 
initial phase that is already funded, and developing the Seaside Wilderness 
Park at the river estuary will be put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 He said voters did not want to part with more tax dollars during tough 
economic times. "It's not a rejection of the project, but of the funding," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Community College District Trustee Pete Tafoya echoed 
sentiments of disappointment Wednesday after the defeat of Proposition 1C, 
which would have funded capital projects in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously there are a number of projects that are in significant jeopardy," 
he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The district had planned to make earthquake repairs at the Moorpark College 
campus library and at other buildings in the district. Plans were under way to 
build a new Letters and Science Building in Oxnard. And the district wanted to 
refurbish some of the old buildings on the Ventura Campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without this proposition, I don't know what we're going to do," Tafoya said. 
"It appears that the state would tend to freeze projects. It's a pretty gloomy 
picture."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; KILLER SENTENCED TO 18 YEARS TO LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A 20-year-old Port Hueneme man who prosecutors say wanted to "be cool" and 
hang around gang members was sentenced to 18 years to life in prison in 
connection with a December slaying at a Ventura motel. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath handed out the sentence to Steven 
Hidalgo, who pleaded guilty last month to second-degree murder and using a 
firearm. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Martinez, 21, of Los Angeles was gunned down on the second-floor balcony 
at Motel 6 on Johnson Drive on Dec. 18. Martinez did not know his attackers, 
who included Hidalgo and at least two other men. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaun Bolo, 20, and his brother, Willard, 23, have also been charged with 
murder in the case. Trials for the two Oxnard men are pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Two others also have been charged with being accessories to the murder. They 
are Naomi Honohan, 19, of Port Hueneme, and Alfonso Cortez, 21, of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Matthew J. Hardy said the victim and the defendants were 
attending separate parties at the motel when the shooting occurred. He said 
Hidalgo had no criminal record and was employed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just decided he was going to go to a party and be a cool guy by flashing 
guns," Hardy said. "He's going to pay for it with the rest of his life." DWAYNE

PERSONAL BEST: A CLOSE-UP LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO MATTER; THEY BEAR IN MIND HOW IT 
USED TO LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The signs lead you through the Hollywood Hills, where Jon Earl and Ellen Petty 
are perfecting the blueprints for their vision. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs, some whimsical, some challenging, greet commuters as they travel 
the winding roads to the city. DRAGONFLY CROSSING, CAR MIGRATION, COYOTES 
CELEBRATING 40,000 YRS. ON THE MOUNTAIN, YOU ARE WATCHING THE NATURE CHANNEL 
are some of the messages Earl and Petty plant on the roadsides, hoping to sow 
understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Off the main road, on the steps up to Earl and Petty's home, handmade paper 
squirrels and raccoons welcome visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 They are gentle reminders that we are only tenants here. That the mountains 
preceded us by eons. And that perhaps, we should bear in mind how those 
mountains looked before we planted homes, subdivisions and pavement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's a good idea to educate people about what was here," said Earl, 
who, with Petty five years ago formed a hands-on environmental organization 
called Rhapsody in Green. "People here either forget or never really knew what 
was here before." 
</P>
<P>
 Studio City-based Rhapsody in Green gives environment-minded volunteers the 
chance to learn what habitats existed before development, as well as the 
opportunity to restore them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We noticed there aren't that many groups that get people involved hands-on to 
restore the environment," Earl said. There are groups that will take support, 
donations, signatures, but not that many that let you get your hands dirty, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhapsody in Green is an army of about 400 volunteers who receive postcards 
every three months detailing projects on which they can labor. Earl and Petty 
then follow up with phone calls, signing people up for various details. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has torn down old barbed-wire fences in a condor preserve, and 
helped clear brush and build cages for a biologist studying captive gibbons in 
Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 It also gleans fruit from abandoned or unused citrus trees and donates the 
food to charities for the homeless or poor. So far, the group has picked about 
100,000 pounds of fruit for Love Is Feeding Everyone and the Los Angeles 
Regional Food Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 And a major project the group has undertaken is helping to restore a portion 
of El Segundo Dunes -- what used to be thousands of acres of coastal prairie 
and dunes. The group has pulled up ice plant, non-native vegetation introduced 
in the 1950s, and is replacing it with deerweed, sunflowers and coastal 
buckwheat, which, Earl said, provides the only food source for the endangered 
El Segundo blue butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
 Now some of the wildlife once known to the area is returning. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a burrowing owl that hadn't been seen out there in 10 years that is 
coming back," Petty said. 
</P>
<P>
 Petty and Earl make their living teaching environmental education in private 
schools and working with a program that pairs handicapped and able-bodied 
students for the benefit and education of both. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, they decided their passion for the environment needed another outlet. 
Rhapsody in Green was born. The group, which recently won a $5,000 Community 
Partnership Award, is hoping to expand to other regions. 
</P>
<P>
 Another project is Bio-regional Rhapsody, an ongoing researching and mapping 
of the habitats of Los Angeles -- based not on what exists now, but what was 
there before development, Earl said. He hopes that will lead to the creation of 
wildlife corridors, connecting the habitats of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 As Earl and Petty spoke, 16-year-old Brittany Kesselman of Encino sat on the 
floor, working on another poster. The words she printed in block letters -- 
borrowed from Henry David Thoreau -- could be the Rhapsody in Green slogan, an 
explanation of Earl and Petty's vision: The earth is more to be admired, than 
to be used.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CITY'S LEAD OFFICER LEAVING FOR NEW POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lt. Geoff Dean, Moorpark's top law enforcement officer, is being transferred 
to an administrative post at the new county jail on Todd Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean, 37, a 16-year veteran of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department, has 
headed the department's 20-member Moorpark enforcement division for three 
years.He also headed the department's 25-member SWAT team until a few months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 During his tenure in Moorpark, that department has received praise for its 
work combatting gangs and developing crime-prevention programs, said Cmdr. 
Bruce McDowell, who has overseen Dean as commander of all patrol divisions in 
the East County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Geoff has been a tremendous chief of police for Moorpark," McDowell said. 
"He's developed a great partnership with the city and private businesses in 
town. He's known in the department as an innovator. It wouldn't surprise me one 
bit to see him advance on up to commander or to whatever else he wants to do." 
</P>
<P>
 McDowell said Dean could take some credit for Moorpark having the lowest crime 
rate in Ventura County for the last two years. He said that since Dean took 
charge of the division three years ago, there has been a 50% reduction in 
reported gang crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 The department is expected to announce Dean's successor today, pending 
approval by Moorpark city staff, McDowell said. Lt. Marty Rouse, a detective in 
the Moorpark division, is the top candidate, he said. SCOTT HADLY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; PUBLIC CAN DISCUSS PLANS TO DEVELOP LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The public can discuss at a City Hall forum tonight whether a 300-acre strip 
of farmland outside the city of Camarillo should be developed. 
</P>
<P>
 The parcel, known as the Ponderosa Corridor, lies adjacent to the city, north 
of the Ventura Freeway. Torrance-based Ran-Rancho Partnerships, which currently 
is using the land to grow row crops and flowers, has signaled its intention to 
develop the parcel. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is hosting the forum, even though the property is in unincorporated 
county territory. According to Matthew J. Boden, the city's director of 
planning and community development, the land sits within the city's "sphere of 
influence" and thus would come under its planning regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Boden said the city has authorized the creation of a preliminary zoning plan 
for the parcel and is seeking the public's comments on how the land might be 
best developed. The site lies directly south of a proposed 89-home tract by the 
Spanish Hills Development Co. 
</P>
<P>
 City-hired consultants already are working on a specific plan for the site and 
an environmental impact report detailing the benefits and possible consequences 
of development there. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to Camarillo Mayor Ken Gose, the parcel represents one of the 
last remaining stretches of undeveloped green space around the city and should 
left as is. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hate to see it developed," Gose said. "The question we have to ask 
ourselves is whether we want to see this place turn into another L.A. I don't 
want this place to be just concrete and people." 
</P>
<P>
 Boden said owners of the parcel, as well as the two consultants studying uses 
for the land, will attend the forum. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultants and members of the city's planning staff will answer questions 
from the public during the forum, addressing what can and cannot be built on 
the property due to height and density restrictions because of the site's 
location under the Camarillo Airport flight path. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will start at 7:30 p.m. at Camarillo City Hall, 601 Carmen Drive.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: FLYNN CALLS FOR END OF JAIL BOOKING FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A push by city leaders to do away with the $120 jail booking fee assessed by 
Ventura County has been endorsed by Supervisor John K. Flynn, who said the fees 
are creating division among local officials. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's board meeting, Flynn told his colleagues that because the fees 
are not charged equally to each of the county's 10 cities, it may be time to 
reassess the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can't find a way to apply (the booking fees) equitably across the 
board, then I think we should consider doing away with the booking fees," Flynn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges, assessed to cities to recoup the cost of processing prisoners 
into county jail, have been collected by Ventura County for the past three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of an unresolved lawsuit filed against the county by a coalition 
of cities, none of the $3 million collected to date has been spent. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the current system, only cities that do not contract out for police 
services -- Simi Valley, Oxnard, Port Hueneme, Ventura and Santa Paula -- are 
charged the fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an earlier court decision, cities contracting with the county for police 
protection cannot be assessed the booking fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors should do away with the assessments now, Flynn said, because a new 
board will be seated in January, following the November vote in which incumbent 
supervisors Maria VanderKolk and Vicky Howard will not be candidates for 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, a group of city leaders wrote a letter to the board requesting the 
fees be discontinued, but that appeal was rejected. JEFF McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: JEWISH SCHOOL PLANS CONEJO VALLEY BRANCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to the requests of Jewish families in the Conejo Valley, a 
Northridge-based Jewish school will open a branch to serve the Thousand Oaks 
area next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The founder of the Abraham Joshua Heschel Day School announced plans Monday to 
hold classes for kindergarten and first-grade students beginning in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually the school will serve students from kindergarten through ninth 
grade, said Shirley Levine, the 22-year-old school's principal and founder. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had parents approach us from the Conejo Valley area saying they wanted to 
send their children to our school in Northridge, but we were too far away," 
Levine said. "With their help, we went about setting up a school in that area." 
</P>
<P>
 Levine said school officials view the Conejo Valley as a place where the 
Jewish community is expanding. She could not predict how many students would 
ultimately enroll in the new school but said the Northridge school serves 500 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the school, which is not affiliated with any temple and will 
serve all branches of Judaism, is to offer Jewish children a general education 
that includes classes that would otherwise be found in a temple after school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The philosophy of the school is to teach a love of learning, enhance 
self-esteem and offer the children a positive Jewish identification," Levine 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school will be located in Agoura Hills but expects to serve families in 
Thousand Oaks, Moorpark, Simi Valley and Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 42-year-old Port Hueneme man convicted of engaging in sex acts with a 
6-year-old boy is mentally disabled and should not be sent to prison, a jury 
ruled Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Lawrence Storch promptly ordered Dennis Ray Thompson 
remanded to the California Department of Mental Health for placement in a state 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not going to be out" for a long time, Deputy Dist. Atty. Patrice D. 
Koenig said after the sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 The same jury convicted Thompson -- who has brain damage and suffers from a 
severe speech impediment -- of five counts of child molestation, Koenig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Neil B. Quinn had argued for Thompson's placement in a 
mental facility, saying he did not understand that what he did with the boy was 
wrong. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; 17 IN ALLEGED SPORTS BETTING RING 
FREED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Seventeen suspects in an alleged major sports bookmaking operation were freed 
from custody Wednesday when authorities said they needed time to review 
evidence seized in the case before deciding whether to charge them. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities stressed that they plan to file conspiracy to commit bookmaking 
charges against the suspects, including a Thousand Oaks man who allegedly was a 
top aide in the ring, but that they need time to review computer records and 
other evidence seized.Authorities must charge defendants within 48 hours of 
arrest, or let them go. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have evidence from 22 locations. It is very tedious and time-consuming," 
said Lt. David Kading of the sheriff's Special Investigations Bureau. "It's 
like a jigsaw puzzle with a million pieces to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kading said the suspects are not considered flight risks, and that they 
probably will be asked to surrender to authorities at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects were part of Southern California's largest illegal sports 
bookmaking operation in recent years, according to authorities who swept 
through five counties Monday, arresting 17 people believed to be involved in an 
enterprise that netted $5 million a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those arrested were Ron LaForgia, 42, of Thousand Oaks, an alleged top 
aide in the organization, along with alleged ring leader Kale Kalustian, 65, of 
Granada Hills, Walter Miller, 55, a Granada Hills resident also believed to be 
an aide, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charges will be filed, certainly, against some people," said Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Michael Montagna, head of the organized crime unit of the district 
attorney's office. "We are just trying to put the case together." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the suspects could be reached for comment. JOSH MEYER

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; MOBILE WORKERS COULD FIGHT CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan to enlist local companies in the fight against crime by asking workers 
on the road to report crimes in progress earned the tentative support of the 
Thousand Oaks City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said Tuesday they would approve the $3,000 in funding needed 
to start the program after the Sheriff's Department reviews the plan and the 
city attorney resolves questions about liability. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's no doubt the council supports this program in concept," said 
Councilwoman Judy Lazar. "Perhaps we can have the Police Department look into 
this a little further to see if similar programs run in other cities have had 
any problems." Lazar said Tuesday night that she hoped the council would 
revisit the issue in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Those speaking in favor of the program, which will ask mobile workers such as 
messengers and delivery people to use their cellular phones to report 
suspicious activity, hailed the idea as an innovative means of preventing 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be quite a deterrent," said Lance Winslow, a local businessman who 
brought the idea before the council last month. "All of a sudden, if you're a 
criminal you're not only looking around for a black-and-white with a light bar 
on top, you're looking out for the ice cream man." Winslow said they idea was 
akin to putting new police out on the street -- for a fraction of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 That's fine, said Councilman Alex Fiore, as long as people are not encouraged 
to be vigilantes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm all for additional programs to deter crime," Fiore said. "But I think I'd 
like to see some additional input before we move any further with this."

<P>
 Simi Valley school officials have agreed to let individual schools establish 
dress codes that encourage, but don't require, students to wear uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of five members of the Simi Valley Unified school board said Tuesday 
that they believe schools should be allowed to establish voluntary uniform 
policies if parents and staff support the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision opens the way for Garden Grove Elementary to move forward with a 
policy that would encourage students to wear blue pants and navy skirts with 
white blouses or shirts. Students not wearing the uniform would be subject to a 
strict dress code, said Principal Elroy Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Carla Kurachi and members Judy Barry and Doug Crosse supported 
allowing schools to introduce uniforms, while board members Diane Collins and 
Debbie Sandland were opposed. JULIE FIELDS

<P>
 An ordinance that would limit Thousand Oaks' power to force business owners to 
make property improvements has moved closer to approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The council Tuesday agreed to hold a hearing and vote on the 
business-improvement proposal and on a plan to streamline the city's building 
regulations regarding access for the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Both initiatives were forwarded to the council by a group of business leaders 
formed by Mayor Elois Zeanah nine months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mayor's Business Roundtable, which was adopted as a standing city 
committee at Tuesday night's meeting, has submitted a list of changes that 
members say will improve relations between the city and the business community.

 All the ideas, including the two forwarded Tuesday for consideration, stemmed 
from brainstorming sessions at weekly meetings organized by Zeanah. 
</P>
<P>
 The business improvement ordinance, if approved, would address business 
leaders' concern that each time local business owners ask to make a change to 
their property, the city can require that a host of other improvements be made. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, said member Francisco Behr, is that businesses are deterred from 
making improvements at all. With this proposal, Behr said, businesses will be 
encouraged to upgrade their properties, a move he said would benefit the city.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; NEW COMMITTEE TO FOCUS ON BOULEVARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The long-discussed refurbishment of Thousand Oaks Boulevard will be the topic 
for a committee formed after Councilwoman Judy Lazar and Mayor Elois Zeanah 
clashed over plans for the future of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 After a bitter debate Tuesday night, Lazar backed down from a plan to hire 
outside consultants to solicit advice from business owners on the boulevard and 
parlay that advice into actual models of an improved business district. 
</P>
<P>
 Forming a group of consultants would have cost $15,000, but Lazar said it 
would have brought the city closer to a resolution of the debate over how to 
revitalize a four-mile stretch of the boulevard that some council members have 
called blighted. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah contended that Lazar's plan would have steamrolled a redevelopment 
project through the council despite a lack of funding and support from 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see why we need to go and spend $15,000 when we haven't taken the 
time to gather the opinions of the public," Zeanah said. "I think we should 
hold a public hearing before we go further on this." 
</P>
<P>
 Lazar disagreed, telling Zeanah that she had "taken this issue and twisted it 
so far out of context it's amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole purpose of the models is to involve the public and the business 
community," Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 After several tense moments in the council chamber, Councilman Frank Schillo 
gained unanimous support for a compromise plan, which asked Lazar to form a 
committee to look into the matter before spending money on consultants. MATTHEW

INTEGRATION OF SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS URGED; THOUSAND OAKS: PILOT EFFORT 
WOULD ALLOW YOUTHS WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES TO ENROLL AT NEARBY CAMPUSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Special education students in Thousand Oaks who now attend mostly classes 
limited to other children with disabilities would be integrated into regular 
classes at schools near their homes under a proposal by local school officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot project would allow about 15 elementary students -- most of whom 
have multiple learning disabilities -- to enroll at Park Oaks and Maple 
elementary schools instead of being bused to one of the district's seven 
campuses that handle special education students. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in the Conejo Unified School District described the experiment as a 
step toward "full inclusion," a nationwide trend that aims to eliminate what 
some critics call the segregation of special education children. The proposal 
will be presented to the school board tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you put it on a continuum, I think it slides in that direction," Assistant 
Supt. Richard Simpson said. "But it's not full inclusion or you would be 
dropping the services for special-ed kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trying to drop services for kids, we're just trying to locate the 
kids where (they) can be most comfortable," he said. "That's a little harder 
for them if they have to travel across town because the program they need is 
located there." 
</P>
<P>
 Like most Ventura County school districts, Conejo Valley already integrates 
special education students with other students for at least part of the school 
day, even if only for lunch and recess. But many special-education children in 
Thousand Oaks do not attend their neighborhood schools, instead traveling by 
bus for 10 to 45 minutes to schools across town. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks school officials say their pilot program, if approved, would be 
optional. The decision to place students in regular classes at schools near 
their homes would be made by parents and teachers together. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who do not function well would receive extra assistance from 
"learning centers" on the campuses of Park Oaks and Maple elementary schools. 
These centers would include at least a teaching specialist and aide. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Thousand Oaks plan receives support from the Conejo Valley school 
board, officials said they hope to expand the program to eventually include 
about 230 students with less serious developmental disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, an estimated 1.6 million children with a range of disabilities now 
spend the entire school day in regular classes, and the number is growing by 
more than 100,000 students a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Full-inclusion, or mainstreaming, has sparked controversy throughout the 
country as parents fight for their children to be placed in mainstream 
classrooms or kept in self-contained programs with lower staff-to-pupil ratios. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal law requires special education students to be taught in "the least 
restrictive environment," but some teachers and parents argue that least 
restrictive does not always mean a mainstream class. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the Ocean View Elementary School District filed a lawsuit 
contending that a developmentally disabled 6-year-old disrupted his 
kindergarten class by allegedly biting a teacher, throwing a desk and hitting 
other students. On Wednesday, a Superior Court judge ordered the child back 
into the classroom for the final week of school. 
</P>
<P>
 In other districts, full-inclusion programs have proved successful. In the 
Fullerton School District, more than 30 students now participate in a 
3-year-old program that officials say benefits developmentally disabled 
children and teaches tolerance to their peers. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Ventura County say more than 70% of the area's 13,000 special 
education students now spend a portion of their day in a regular classroom. 
Only about 1,000 severely disabled students spend all or nearly all of their 
time in special programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, the Moorpark Unified School District began a pilot full-inclusion 
program that places six moderately to severely disabled students in regular 
classes. Part-time aides assist teachers in those classrooms, but the aides do 
not work exclusively with the special education students. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not only been beneficial for the student with disabilities, but for the 
entire class," said Dolores Allen, coordinator of Moorpark's special education 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 She added, however, that full-inclusion is not for every child and the 
decision to do so must be made jointly by parents, teachers and specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Ventura Unified School District, as in Conejo Valley, students with 
moderate disabilities are bused to central campuses with special day classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just don't have the luxury of providing a special day class at every one 
of our sites," said Ricardo Nargie, director of Ventura's special education 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Nargie questioned whether the closest schools are always the best for such 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be very selective and take each case as it comes based on a 
child's needs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Conejo Valley, the pilot program would not require extra staff members 
because teachers would be transferred from other sites, said Connie Farkas, 
coordinator of elementary special education. And to prepare mainstream teachers 
at Park Oaks and Maple schools, special training sessions would be held. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Conejo Valley school board members said Wednesday they want to make sure 
the pilot program would not push special education youngsters or teachers too 
far. 
</P>
<P>
 Said board President Dolores Didio: "If you don't even try it, you won't know 
if it's going to be good or not." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The board of the Conejo Valley Unified School District meets tonight at 7:30 
in the district offices at 1400 E. Janss Road in Thousand Oaks.

OXNARD WARNS OF POSSIBLE LAYOFFS; BUDGET: DESPITE THE PROMISE OF FIRINGS AND 
TRANSFERS BY CITY OFFICIALS, THE POLICE CHIEF HAS VOWED TO FIGHT FOR 16 NEW 
POSITIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Oxnard officials may have to lay off municipal workers and step up a push to 
make city departments more efficient next fiscal year under a budget proposal 
unveiled Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said as many as 37 employees may have to be laid off or 
transferred to other departments to balance the 1994-95 spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
 No police officers or firefighters would be cut under City Manager Thomas 
Frutchey's budget proposal, but Police Chief Harold Hurtt said he intends to 
ask the City Council for 16 new positions during next week's budget study 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The $60.3-million General Fund budget -- Frutchey's first since becoming city 
manager late last year -- comes a year after officials ordered a sweeping 
reduction of city departments to avoid layoffs and make City Hall more 
efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 In his budget message, Frutchey said the proposed spending plan for the next 
fiscal year would not reduce city services. And he said he would try to avoid 
layoffs by shuffling workers to other departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "A net of 55 positions will be reduced over the next year. One-third of the 
positions to be deleted are vacant; the remainder, however, are filled with 
skilled, knowledgeable people (who) have provided years of service to Oxnard," 
Frutchey said. "This year, for the first time, we may lose some very valuable 
employees." 
</P>
<P>
 Grace Hoffman, the city's management and budget officer, cautioned that the 
budget document is still preliminary and subject to change. 
</P>
<P>
 "This budget proposal assumes the worst-case scenario," Hoffman said. "We felt 
it was the only prudent way to prepare a budget document given the 
(unpredictable) actions of the state government when it comes to local 
revenues." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman said no decisions on layoffs or transfers have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 But David Hartsuck, president of the Ventura chapter of the Service Employees 
International Union, said there will probably be more layoffs than transfers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be brutal," Hartsuck said. "I'm not sure we'll be able to 
find room for them all." 
</P>
<P>
 Hartsuck said he was hoping that the city would eliminate jobs through 
attrition or use the city's $9 million in reserve funds to keep city workers 
employed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This economy will change eventually and we will need these people again," 
Hartsuck said. "I think the city should rethink this seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Andres Herrera said the cuts may be a necessary part of the 
city's commitment to delivering municipal services more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are going to be some real hits," Herrera said. "But I think we know 
that sacrifices are going to have to be made if we are going to reach the level 
of efficiency that we have pledged to attain. This is not going to be easy or 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt said Wednesdaythat while he was glad his department emerged largely 
unscathed under the proposed budget, he will fight to gain 16 positions for the 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider this a 'hold-the-line' budget at best. And, I'm sorry to hear that 
we may have to lay offsome of our city employees," Hurtt said. "But, it is 
still my intention over the next few days and weeks to remind the council of 
its commitment to increasing the number of officers we have." 
</P>
<P>
 Budget study sessions will be held next Tuesday and Thursday. The budget is 
expected to be adopted by the council later this month.

JOSEPH W. CROSBY; SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joseph W. Crosby, who served as superintendent of the Oxnard Union High School 
District for 18 years, died Tuesday evening after a brief illness. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
 Crosby lived in Camarillo with his wife, Lucille. The couple had been married 
50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 As superintendent of the high school district from 1957 to 1974, Crosby 
oversaw an ambitious building program to keep up with the area's growing 
population. Under his leadership, bond measures were passed to build El Rio, 
Hueneme and Channel Islands high schools, his wife said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crosby also directed the construction of Newbury Park and Thousand Oaks high 
schools, which later split off to form the Conejo Valley Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his accomplishments as superintendent, it was counseling students that 
Crosby enjoyed most, his wife said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there had been enough children who had a problem, he wouldn't have taken 
the superintendency," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to being named superintendent, Crosby organized and ran Oxnard High 
School's counseling department for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Niagara Falls, N.Y., Crosby grew up in Los Angeles. He earned his 
bachelor's degree in philosophy from St. Mary's College in Moraga, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 After serving in the U.S. Coast Guard for two years, he earned a master's 
degree in philosophy and a Ph.D. in education from the University of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 After retiring in Oxnard, Crosby taught graduate school classes on military 
bases in Europe from 1974-79. He is survived by a son, Harry, and three 
grandchildren.

RAPPER WARREN G.: THE 'G' DOESN'T MEAN 'GANGSTA'; POP MUSIC: WITH FUNKY, 
COMPLEX BASS LINES AND PRETTY MELODY, THE MUSIC ON HIS DEBUT ALBUM ISN'T LIKE 
DR. DRE OR SNOOP DOGGY DOGG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 "Man, I coulda been dead . . . dead ." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking rather unnerved Warren G. -- the younger brother of rap superstar Dr. 
Dre and now high on the pop charts himself with the Top 10 single "Regulate" -- 
was talking about his brush with death not long before. 
</P>
<P>
 Slumped in a chair in a West Hollywood hotel lounge, the lanky 23-year-old 
(real name Warren Griffin) explains that he choked on a piece of steak in his 
room a half hour earlier. Fortunately a buddy, using the Heimlich maneuver, 
saved him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought maybe I'd be snuffed out by a bullet one day -- but not a piece of 
steak," says the soft-spoken, easy-going rapper. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin -- a longtime pal of Snoop Doggy Dogg, who's currently facing murder 
charges -- manages a slight laugh at the irony of his narrow escape. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Long Beach native looks like anything but a tough guy, he says he 
had some real brushes with death during his gangbanging days, as well as some 
scrapes with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 But such problems, he insists, are all behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so law-abiding now, it's scary," he quips. 
</P>
<P>
 His main focus for the past year has been his debut album, "Regulate . . . G 
Funk Era," which was released Tuesday by Def Jam Records. It includes 
"Regulate," which features Nate Dogg and a sample of the old Michael McDonald 
hit "I Keep Forgettin'." This single is the hit that's helped make the "Above 
the Rim" soundtrack album a fixture in the pop Top 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Boasting funky, complex bass lines and pretty melody, Griffin's music isn't 
gangsta rap a la Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's fine for Snoop and Dre to do gangsta rap but that's not the direction 
I want to go in on my own albums," he explains. "I don't want to read in some 
tabloid that some guy got inspired by some gangsta rap tune I did and then went 
out and got shot in some shootout." 
</P>
<P>
 In some circles if you're a rapper who doesn't do gangsta rap, it's open 
season on your manhood. He's well aware of that. In his most macho tone, the 
usually soft-spoken Griffin snapped: "Just because I don't do that stuff 
doesn't mean I'm a sissy. Anybody who messes with me will find that out in a 
hurry." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin was just as huffy about the notion that he's riding on Dre's 
coattails. (They're actually half-brothers.) "That's not what happened," he 
insists. "I was offered this deal with Def Jam based on them seeing me in a 
video with Mista Grimm. They didn't know I was Dre's brother. By the way, Dre 
is not on my album. He was going to do a track but he didn't have time. So 
nobody can say I'm using him that way." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Dre didn't personally get him signed to a deal but Griffin might not 
have been in a position to command a contract if his rich and famous relative 
hadn't helped him along the way. Griffin's recording debut was a small speaking 
part on a 1991 album by N.W.A, the quintessential gangsta rap group featuring 
Eazy-E, Ice Cube and Dre. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin, who rapped with Snoop Dogg as a youngster in a group called 213, also 
helped with some of the lyrics on "The Chronic," Dre's blockbuster 1992 album. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, meeting director John Singleton through Dre led to Griffin producing and 
rapping on Mista Grimm's "Indo Smoke" and 2Pac's "Definition of a Thug" for the 
soundtrack for Singleton's movie "Poetic Justice." Def Jam executives, Griffin 
says, spotted him in the "Indo Smoke" video, which led to his record deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin, though, does give his older brother full credit for inspiring him to 
become a producer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to watch him work when I was a teen-ager and I was fascinated by 
producing," he recalls. "I asked him to show me how to do it and he showed me. 
I started deejaying and mixing (songs) at parties and kept at it until I got 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 How did he make the move from producing to rapping? 
</P>
<P>
 "I could always do both, but I'd always been focusing more on producing," he 
replies. "I could rap and everybody else around me was always rapping because 
it was the hip, flashy thing to do. But when I was younger I always got a real 
rush from doing what a producer does. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember when I was 14 or 15, being in my house working with a small drum 
machine and mixing on a turntable while Snoop was rapping. That was great. Even 
then I could see myself headed for a producing career." 
</P>
<P>
 But when he was growing up, struggling through Long Beach Jordan High, he 
didn't seem headed for anything but trouble. "I was hustling, doing a lot of 
the wrong things," he recalls. "I'm not sure I had any real strong goals. But I 
had one thing going for myself -- I always wanted to make my own way, to be 
independent. I didn't want to lean on my parents or Dre -- though Dre has 
helped me with money and let me live with him for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "My momma didn't think I would amount to anything. She'd say: 'Stop that damn 
rapping and get a job.' I can see her point now. I was just drifting along, as 
teen-agers do. But I got lucky. I made a few right decisions and got some 
breaks. She's proud of me now, which really makes me feel good." 
</P>
<P>
 When he was in his teens, one of the few constants in his life was music. 
Griffin recalls whiling away hours listening to his father's jazz and R&B 
albums. "I would listen to all that stuff and dream a little about making music 
myself one day," he says. "At the time it seemed like just silly kid's dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 Just about then the waiter served Griffin a late lunch -- a huge steak. 
"Wouldn't you think I'd be scared of eating steak again after what just 
happened?" he asked. "No way. That's not the way I am. I ain't scared of 
anything. "

service, sun themselves in poolside lounge chairs, and sip tall drinks topped 
with tropical fruit and tiny umbrellas. But they can't watch the evening news 
on Channel 7. 
</P>
<P>
 In what is being called a protest of WSVN-TV's often-sensational, crime-driven 
news coverage, the hotels' management has blocked access to the Fox Network 
affiliate in some 3,000 rooms in Miami, Fort Lauderdale and Key West. 
</P>
<P>
 The blackout of Channel 7, labeled censorship by some critics, has focused 
national attention once again on Florida's image as a crime-plagued vacation 
spot. Since October, 1992, nine foreign visitors to Florida have been slain in 
a spate of random violence. Last month a group of Norwegian tourists was robbed 
after their shuttle bus was hijacked at gunpoint from the Miami airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The hoteliers charge that Channel 7, which often leads its 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. 
newscasts with breathless reports from crime scenes, distorts the reality of 
South Florida and scares visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's body bags and blood, and the more blood the better it is," said Victor 
Farkas, who has pulled the plug on all of WSVN's programming in his two North 
Miami Beach hotels. "It does no good for the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Brigham, a spokesman for the 420-room Doral Ocean Beach Resort, said, 
"We're trying to send a message to Channel 7. The other stations don't present 
news in such a violent, tabloid way." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Leider, executive vice president and general manager of Sunbeam 
Television Corp., owner of WSVN, said the blackout would not change Channel 7's 
newscasts. "It is our job to cover the news and we will not censor our newscast 
to placate the hotel industry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, according to a University of Miami study released Wednesday, WSVN 
has cut back substantially on the percentage of crime news, at least in the 6 
p.m. newscast. During a week monitored last November, crime stories made up 49% 
of the 30-minute newscast, twice as much as any other station. But in the week 
of May 23, crime news dropped to 31.7%, virtually the same as that in the 
newscast of ratings-leader WPLG-TV, the ABC affiliate owned by the Washington 
Post. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Cheatwood, the Sunbeam vice president who oversees the news, denied WSVN 
deliberately has cut back on crime coverage. He added, however, that his 
station, as well as others in Miami, "have made a concerted effort to provide 
more context, and be more sensitive to reporting crime after crime." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau has taken no official 
position on the hotel blackout. But spokesman Mayco Villafana was certainly 
sympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hoteliers' frustration has boiled over at the way things are covered," 
said Villafana. "Channel 7 is giving the impression that these acts of violence 
are a reflection of the entire community, and to me this is not just. There is 
no perspective, no depth to their reporting." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, WSVN seems to like nothing better than to open its newscasts with a 
live, breaking story, often the bloody aftermath of a liquor store shoot-out or 
a traffic fatality. Recordings of tortured emergency 911 calls are popular. 
Anchors Rick Sanchez and Kelly Mitchell, along with several of the station's 
reporters, are also known for a narrative style that charitably could be called 
over-dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, it's everything the critics say it is -- sensationalistic, lubricious 
and irresponsibly gruesome," Miami Herald columnist Carl Hiaasen wrote this 
week. "If Jeffrey Dahmer lived here, Channel 7 undoubtedly would be his 
favorite station." 
</P>
<P>
 The movement to shield the visitors from the more lurid goings-on in South 
Florida was begun last month by Farkas. Guests of his Thunderbird and the 
Chateau by the Sea cannot watch "Melrose Place," "The Simpsons" or "America's 
Most Wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Thomas F. Hewitt, president of the Continental Cos., owners of Miami's 
posh Grand Bay Hotel and six other area hotels, said he would join the protest 
by blacking out just the news. 
</P>
<P>
 Hewitt said he had communicated personally with Sanchez, asking for changes in 
WSVN's broadcast and telling the anchorman that he had "reached the breaking 
point." Hewitt suggested Channel 7 redesign its newscast so that it would more 
resemble rival WCIX Channel 6, a CBS-owned affiliate. In May, WCIX announced a 
"family sensitive" news policy in which violent footage is withheld from the 6 
p.m. news.

THE ORANGE COUNTY VOTE; SILVA PICKS UP TILLOTSON'S ENDORSEMENT; RUNOFF: 
SUPERVISORIAL RACE WILL PIT A REPUBLICAN AGAINST A DEMOCRAT. ONE VETERAN 
POLITICIAN IS PREDICTING 'A REAL SHOOTOUT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Losing supervisorial candidate Haydee V. Tillotson threw her support Wednesday 
to fellow Republican and front-runner Jim Silva for the fall campaign in what 
promises to be a volatile runoff for the northwest county seat on Orange 
County's governing board. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva finished first in the five-way race for the 2nd District seat, narrowly 
edging Huntington Beach Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson and Tillotson. Because no 
candidate was able to secure more than 50% of the vote, Silva, a Huntington 
Beach councilman, will face Moulton Patterson in the Nov. 8 runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be a blood bath, no question," Supervisor William G. Steiner said 
Wednesday, after his own election victory. "You're going to see a lot of money 
coming from inside and outside the county. This will be a real shootout." 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisor said the Lincoln Club, whose membership includes some of the 
most generous Republican donors in the county, has aligned itself with Silva, 
while the Democrats are expected to throw full support and money behind Moulton 
Patterson in what is supposed to be a race where political party affiliation 
doesn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no such thing as a nonpartisan race in Orange County," Steiner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than three percentage points separated Silva and Moulton Patterson from 
third-place finisher Tillotson, whose failure to make the runoff will go down 
as the most expensive personal loss of Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
 Tillotson had lent her campaign more than $342,000 -- more than any other 
local candidate this election season -- only to fall short of the runoff for 
retiring Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder's seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, Tillotson was "too disappointed" to speak publicly about a loss 
that her campaign manager blamed on the record-low voter turnout in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Haydee put her heart and soul into this campaign," Christopher D. St. Helaire 
said. "She doesn't feel much like talking. I don't think she has any regrets, 
other than maybe not pulling some voters out to the polls by the hair to vote." 
</P>
<P>
 In the other two races for supervisor, incumbent Steiner, facing a weakly 
funded challenge, and state Sen. Marian Bergeson, who ran unopposed, easily won 
their contests. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeping election victories were also claimed by county Treasurer-Tax 
Collector Robert L. Citron and Assessor Bradley L. Jacobs, who both weathered 
recent office controversies and campaign criticisms. John F. Dean was another 
easy winner in his bid for a second term as superintendent of schools. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the four-way race for the county Clerk-Recorder office, Clerk Gary L. 
Granville was not able to extend his lead to claim an outright victory over 
Recorder Lee A. Branch, despite a misconduct censure earlier this year of the 
incumbent recorder whose office will be merged with the clerk's next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Branch and Granville will meet again in the Nov. 8 runoff election. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now it comes down to the two of us, and that's the way it should be," said 
Granville, who finished with 42% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Branch, whose office has been the subject of two investigations of personnel 
and general mismanagement during the past year, said his office is undergoing a 
total reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
 "I plan to get the garbage cleaned up," he said. "I'm going to take back 
control of this office." 
</P>
<P>
 But much of the post-election attention in county government continued to 
center in Huntington Beach, where Silva, Moulton Patterson and Tillotson ran 
nearly a dead heat Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The three emerged from a field of five candidates who also included Huntington 
Beach businessman John A. Thomas and former Garden Grove Councilman Raymond 
Thomas Littrell. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Silva, however, who managed the first-place finish, despite having the 
most difficulty raising campaign money of the top three contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, after charging Tillotson during the campaign with using personal 
money to "buy" a seat on the board, Silva gladly accepted news of her 
endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva said he was preparing for the fall campaign and believed it would be 
free of the viciousness that marked the final weeks of the primary race. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, among Silva's strongest supporters, had warned 
local business people that Moulton Patterson, by virtue of her Democratic Party 
affiliation, represented a serious threat to board's conservative style of 
governing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope the voters will be pleasantly surprised," Silva said. "Linda is an 
honorable person. Voters should hopefully get a clear-cut campaign on the 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton Patterson predicted a more spirited campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be a very intense and very negative campaign, even though it 
is supposed to be a nonpartisan race," she said. "You can expect them 
(Republicans) to put up big money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also expect Roger Stanton to continue strong-arming people to support 
Silva," the mayor said, referring to Stanton's fund-raising efforts." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton said he will continue in his support of Silva, but denied that he had 
ever "strong-armed" contributions on behalf of the candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's lying," Stanton said. "She's an interesting person, having come into my 
office asking for my support only a few months ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Steiner, a Republican, has not taken a position in the race, he 
offered a subtle warning to Moulton Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tone of her campaign sounds like she is running against all of the board 
members," he said. "It's important that she not burn her bridges. It can get 
lonely up here." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Helaire, of the Tillotson camp, said that he, too, expected a nasty fall 
campaign, but believed his candidate would offer no more than her moral 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you'll see Haydee making too many political contributions," he 
said. "She's made her contributions this year."

THE ORANGE COUNTY VOTE; DEFEAT OF PROP. 180 IMPERILS LAND DEAL; ENVIRONMENT: 
BACKERS PLAN TO EXPLORE OTHER FUNDING SOURCES FOR PURCHASE OF OPEN SPACE IN 
LAGUNA CANYON FROM IRVINE CO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Proponents of a failed statewide bond measure that would have provided $25 
million to buy more open space in Laguna Canyon were hopeful Wednesday they 
could overcome the major setback and still save the land from development. 
</P>
<P>
 After voters in Tuesday's election defeated Proposition 180 -- the main source 
of funding for the canyon land -- city officials and fund-raising leaders 
prepared to explore other ways to ensure that 1,500 homes will not be built on 
the pristine strip of land alongside Laguna Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, no one could say precisely where the money will come from. And the 
measure's demise was the latest in a series of disasters and disappointments 
for Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 In a city battered since October by a massive firestorm, mudslides and 
discovery of ancient landslides beneath residential areas, Mayor Ann Christoph 
sounded a note of resignation Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sort of used to bad news," said Christoph, who had mailed postcards to 
friends throughout the state lobbying for passage of Proposition 180. "(And) 
they just hit us again with more bad news." 
</P>
<P>
 But Christoph and others involved in the fund-raising drive to buy 189 acres 
-- the last segment of a 2,150-acre open space purchase known as Laguna Laurel 
-- said they don't intend to give up. 
</P>
<P>
 "The phones have been ringing, ringing, ringing," Laguna Canyon Foundation 
director Mary Fegraus said Wednesday. Supporters "are so disappointed . . . 
(but) they still feel this project was meant to be." 
</P>
<P>
 The $25 million promised under the bond measure would have provided the bulk 
of the $33 million, plus interest, that Laguna Beach needs to make the final 
payment for land the city has agreed to buy from the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The landmark purchase agreement reached in 1990 called for the city to buy a 
total of 2,150 acres over five years for $78 million. The initial payment of 
$33 million was paid in 1991, and lesser payments followed in subsequent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Preservationists have worried over how they would scrape together the final 
$33-million payment due next June, and pinned their hopes on Proposition 180. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,500 local volunteers joined the effort, first to get the 
California Parks and Wildlife initiative, CALPAW, on the ballot and then to win 
voter support. Many Leisure World residents, whose community abuts the canyon 
acreage, joined the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Proposition 180 failed, along with most other statewide spending 
measures on the ballot, apparent victims of an anti-spending sentiment sweeping 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first reaction is just extreme disappointment, but I certainly understand 
why the vote went the way it did in such a recessionary time," said Laguna 
Beach Councilman Robert F. Gentry, who was involved in the original 
negotiations with the Irvine Co. "People just do not want to risk additional 
debt and I understand that." 
</P>
<P>
 Gentry said the city and the Irvine Co. will meet soon to weigh alternatives. 
"We both want the final purchase to happen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Irvine Co. agreed Wednesday that all is not lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are very resourceful and determined people," said Larry Thomas, senior 
vice president of corporate communications. "It does place the ball back in 
their court to secure financing for the fifth year. But we're pretty confident 
they have the imagination and the energy to accomplish that. I think they 
probably surprised people having come this far in being able to put this 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Fegraus and city officials offered a list Wednesday of other possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Fegraus said state or federal grants may be available and "a couple million" 
will come from private sources. She said residents in some areas near the open 
space may be willing to form an assessment district to help pay for the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said that if the economy improves, 
new construction could generate developer fees that could be used to buy open 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody's giving up at this point," Frank said. Laguna Park in 
Limbo Rejection of Proposition 180 has thrown into question the purchase of the 
last parcel of the proposed Laguna Laurel development for inclusion in Laguna 
Wilderness Park. The city of Laguna Beach has relied on a variety of funding 
sources to purchase other parcels that are part of the deal. Laguna Beach 
taxpayers: 44% Orange County: 22 Proposition 70 allocation: 12 Laguna Beach 
Open Space Fund: 10 California Wildlife Conservation Board: 9 State Grants: 2 
Private donations: 1 Laguna Laurel Purchase at a Glance Landowner: Irvine Co. 
Total acres: 2,150 Acres left to purchase: 189 Total purchase cost: $ 78

NATIVE AMERICAN CEMETERY EVIDENCE FOUND AT KOLL SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New disclosures about human bones unearthed at the Bolsa Chica wetlands have 
provided evidence that the site was once a Native American cemetery and raised 
further questions about proposed development there.  
</P>
<P>
 The disclosures, which surfaced this week, came as the Orange County Grand 
Jury announced it would not pursue an investigation into how the Koll Real 
Estate Group, which owns most of the property, has handled the discovery of the 
bones. 
</P>
<P>
 The probe was requested by the Huntington Beach City Council in February after 
allegations by Native Americans and others that the Koll group had mishandled 
the bones, which had been discovered by archeologists. 
</P>
<P>
 The company plans to build 4,286 homes at the site, a controversial 
development that could be delayed by evidence showing that it was a cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been learned that the bones included four intact craniums and the 
femurs of at least 20 individuals. An archeological map dated March 1 noted 
some bones were found in graves containing enough skeletal remains to indicate 
that the bodies were in a fetal position. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Desautels, the archeologist in charge of the project, said Wednesday 
that the evidence suggests a prehistoric Native American cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than one individual means it was planned land use," she said. "If you 
find more than one, obviously they intended it as a plot to inter individuals." 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials had previously described the site as containing only 
scattered "bone fragments" of an unknown number of people. 
</P>
<P>
 The new information was contained in documents circulated by Samuel H. Dunlap, 
a former Native American monitor for the company who said he became 
disillusioned when the Koll group would not follow his suggestion to expand 
excavations in anticipation of further finds. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap could not be reached for comment on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lucy Dunn, the company's senior vice president, characterized the argument 
as a dispute over the former monitor's request for a 50% pay increase -- from 
$200 to $300 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears to be a money issue, not an issue of substance," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the significance of the discovery was not lost upon the Bolsa Chica 
Land Trust, which opposes the proposed residential development on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Flossie Horgan, spokeswoman for the land trust, said Wednesday that "these are 
8,000-year-old prehistoric remains we have in our midst. It is not appropriate 
to build 5,000 homes over this ancient site and have this lost to future 
generations." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the release of new archeological information, there was other news 
this week as it was learned the grand jury had declined to investigate the Koll 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have determined that this concerns a complex set of problems involving the 
United States government, the state of California, the Coastal Commission and 
the Koll company," Raymond B. Arballo, chair of the grand jury's 
environment/transportation committee, wrote in a May 27 letter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The grand jury has no jurisdiction over any of these entities," the letter 
continued. "The Orange County agencies involved in this matter appear to have 
acted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations."

PLANE MAY HAVE BROKEN UP IN STORM; CRASH: WITNESSES SAY PIECES FELL FROM PLANE 
CARRYING TWO ORANGE COUNTY COUPLES BEFORE FLORIDA CRASH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Investigators combed a rural Florida orange grove Wednesday for clues to the 
cause of a plane crash that killed two couples from Orange County who were en 
route to a boating vacation in the Cayman Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities identified the victims as Jack A. George, 63, of Newport Beach, 
the pilot and owner of the private plane; Colleen O'Neill, 50, of Costa Mesa; 
and Carolyn Ann Speers, 57, and Dallas Earle Speers Jr., 66, of Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Speerses were flying with George, a pilot for nearly 40 years and a 
longtime friend, for the first time, according to family members.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's all just kind of too much right now," said Greg Jones of South Pasadena, 
Carolyn Speers' son from a previous marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal investigators said George's twin-engine 1967 Beechcraft Barron BE-55 
was flying through heavy thunderstorms Tuesday about noon PST when the aircraft 
apparently began to disintegrate in flight and crashed into an orange grove 
near Wauchula, Fla., about 65 miles southeast of Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said they saw pieces of the plane falling before it slammed into a 
ditch between orange groves, said Andrew Alston, an investigator with the 
National Transportation Safety Board. Wreckage from the plane was strewn across 
a 2 1/2-mile area in Hardee County. No injuries were reported on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The four had left the tiny El Monte airport Monday morning and made a stop in 
St. Angelo, Tex., before heading for Havana, a suburb of Tallahassee, on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 George, a retired defense contractor, had filed a flight plan for the third 
leg of the trip from Havana to Key West. In Key West, family members said, the 
group was expected to join several other fliers headed in a caravan to the 
Cayman Islands, south of Jamaica.  
</P>
<P>
 George was flying at about 9,000 feet Tuesday afternoon when air traffic 
controllers in Miami warned him that thunderstorms were straight ahead, Alston 
said. Controllers gave George permission to change course to avoid the storms, 
but soon lost radio and radar contact with him, Alston said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation was expected to focus heavily on the thunderstorms as a 
possible cause of the crash, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip to the Cayman Islands was something the two couples had been looking 
to with much excitement, family members said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 George, originally from South Pasadena, had owned the Beechcraft for 20 years, 
according to his son, Tobin George, 35. The retiree had starting with flying 
lessons after the birth of his daughter, now 38. George's own father was a 
pilot during World War I and flying was "his first love," according to family 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 George, who was divorced, flew all over the country with O'Neill. He moved to 
Newport Beach in 1992, soon after dissolving his business. He is survived by 
two children and three grandchildren.  
</P>
<P>
 George's family members said they believed that O'Neill had two children of 
her own. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas Speers was also born and raised in South Pasadena, where he ran a 
television and radio repair sales and service shop, "Speers' TV," for 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas and Carolyn Speers married about 7 years ago, second marriages for 
both, and bought a home in Laguna Beach, according to family members. Carolyn 
Speers also had come from the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the Speers often cruised between Newport Beach and Dana 
Point harbors on their boat, The Whisper II. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas Speers also was a volunteer for the Laguna Beach Police Department, 
working for about six years as the department's alarm officer. His job was to 
bill property owners for hooking up home security systems and notify them of 
penalties for too many false alarms. Through his work, the former Pasadena 
reserve police officer raised "a couple hundred thousand dollars" for the city, 
Chief Neil J. Purcell Jr. said.  
</P>
<P>
 He would never accept a penny in compensation for his time, at least 12 hours 
each week. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did a wonderful job in dealing with the people," Purcell said. "All our 
folks just enjoyed and admired him." 
</P>
<P>
 Colleagues placed a bouquet on his desk Wednesday and stopped by throughout 
the day for a moment of silence. Purcell remembered the Speers for how well 
they got along and relished doing things together, such as boating. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just enjoyed life," Purcell said. "They celebrated life." 
</P>
<P>
 The state Legislature was expected to make a brief memorial today for the 
couple, said LuAnne Pisarski, Dallas Speers' daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were highly liked in California," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas Speers is survived by two daughters and two grandchildren. Carolyn 
Speers is survived by four children and three grandchildren.

THE ORANGE COUNTY VOTE; OFFICIALS FEEL VOTER UNREST IN FULLERTON, WESTMINSTER; 
RECALL: ONE CITY OUSTS 3 COUNCIL MEMBERS. ANOTHER RETAINS 4 POLITICIANS, BUT 
ONE OFFICIAL SAYS SCARS REMAIN.

 One was a 31-year veteran of the city's Police Department, another a former 
planning commissioner, the third a longtime member of a variety of community 
committees. Together, they've lived in Fullerton 114 years and served 30 years 
on its City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they're out on their political ears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very, very disappointed, but I have no regrets at all," said Councilman 
Don Bankhead, who was ousted Tuesday, along with colleagues Molly McClanahan 
and A.B. (Buck) Catlin in Orange County's first successful recall election 
since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face it, the people in our nation are greatly upset and turned off on 
government. Unfortunately, the closest ones to take it out on are the locals," 
sighed Bankhead, 61, a retired police captain. "If things are going to get 
better, (it's) going to have to start at the top and go down because the money 
starts at the top. If you're attacking the people at the bottom, you're really 
attacking the wrong group." 
</P>
<P>
 Angry about a 2% utility tax the three lawmakers passed last summer to balance 
the city's budget, Fullerton voters kicked Bankhead, Catlin and McClanahan out 
of office, with at least 52% supporting recall in each case. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Fullerton's city clerk beat a recall attempt, as did four 
Westminster council members. Westminster's bitter campaign focused on the 
council's layoff last year of five firefighters, but the recall effort died 
with about 65% of the voters opposing it Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a nightmare," said Westminster Councilwoman Charmayne S. Bohman. "This 
is a vindication for the council. This shows that we have acted responsibly." 
</P>
<P>
 In accordance with state law, Fullerton's recalled council members will remain 
in office until a special election is held to replace them. The election is 
planned during the first two weeks of October, but City Manager James L. 
Armstrong said he hopes to postpone the special election -- which would cost 
about $100,000 -- until November, when two of the three seats are up for 
reelection anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 W. Snow Hume, secretary of the Fullerton Recalls Committee, said recall 
proponents are now on the lookout for potential council candidates. None of 
those who powered the campaign will be on the ballot, he promised. 
</P>
<P>
 "We especially want people who are not politically ambitious, who never 
thought about running for council," Hume said. "We want reform. We don't want 
political ambitions. That's what this movement is about." 
</P>
<P>
 Bankhead and McClanahan, who cannot run in the special election, said they are 
unsure whether they will try to reclaim their seats in the future. Catlin, 75, 
a former planning commissioner and the city's current mayor, did not return 
calls for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not off the council yet, and I will not trash my city," said McClanahan, 
56, who was a city volunteer for 16 years before her election to the council in 
1982. "I'm going to continue to provide intelligent leadership as best I know 
how." 
</P>
<P>
 The recall results stunned Fullerton leaders -- and county political pundits. 
</P>
<P>
 Consultant Eileen Padberg said she was "amazed," while Cal State Fullerton 
political science chairwoman Sandra Sutphen said she was "shocked and 
surprised" that such longtime council leaders were ousted over a relatively 
small tax. 
</P>
<P>
 And at UC Irvine, local government expert Mark Petracca said the Fullerton 
election showed the importance of recall in the democratic process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm delighted that someone finally got recalled, because it is going to scare 
the pants off of every elected official in this county who thinks it can't 
happen to them," Petracca said. "It's just nice on occasion to see citizens 
beat City Hall." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's last successful recall was in 1989 when Fred Voss was deposed 
as Fountain Valley mayor. There have been 21 recalls since then, but only one 
other even made it to the ballot before this year's elections in Fullerton and 
Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 The two recall elections differed in several key ways, experts said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Launched by employees and supported by sympathetic unions across the state, 
Westminster's recall battle had consultants on both sides, which used 
sophisticated direct-mail campaigns. In Fullerton, though, the recall campaign 
took on a grass-roots flavor as volunteers -- many retirees who met while 
working for Ross Perot's presidential bid -- stood on street corners waving 
placards. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Fullerton's recall was about a tax hike, Westminster's concerned 
a cut in services. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are more adverse to having their taxes increased during a recession 
than they are to seeing general cuts in services," Petracca said. "The lesson 
for other cities is, don't raise your taxes, try cutting services. And hope, 
hope that no one tries to recall you." 
</P>
<P>
 In Westminster Wednesday, City Hall was filled with sighs of relief, as 
Bohman, Mayor Charles V. Smith and council members Craig Schweisinger and Tony 
Lam held on to their posts. 
</P>
<P>
 "People sent a message that their elected officials will run the city, not the 
firefighters," said a confident Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 But some see the recall effort as just Round 1 in a bitter fight between 
firefighters and city management. 
</P>
<P>
 Later this month, an arbitrator will review the grievances of six Fire 
Department employees fired in May. And the Westminster Firefighters Assn., 
which led the recall effort, has promised to revive the issues when Lam, 
Schweisinger and Smith face reelection in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Chief John T. DeMonaco Jr. acknowledged Wednesday that the recall 
election will leave scars in his department, but he said he hopes the healing 
has begun. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a big fight for everyone," DeMonaco said. "We need a chance to 
rebuild."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; STUDENTS GET A FEEL FOR THE LANGUAGE

 With wonder in his eyes, Hung Phan, 12, reached into a tank of cold seawater 
and gingerly plucked out a monstrous red crab. Grinning, Hung turned it over 
and watched it wave long, spindly legs in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels weird. It's all rough and spiky," he said moments later. 
</P>
<P>
 Glancing toward two portable tanks simulating a California tide pool, complete 
with a shark, sea anemones and sea stars, he added: "This is a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Hung was one of about 250 Finley Elementary School students who saw and 
touched dozens of sea creatures Wednesday as part of a program designed to 
improve language skills for students who speak limited English, school 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Called Project SMILE, which stands for Science and Math Instruction Leading to 
English, the program focuses primarily on the school's 300 Spanish- and 
Vietnamese-speaking children. The program features hands-on activities that 
teach students English by giving them something exciting and educational to 
discuss at school and at home, said coordinator Diane Materazzi. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of that program, students visited the traveling tide pool exhibit, run 
by the Living Science Foundation, a nonprofit group based in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, another 250 students will go through the program, which also includes a 
slide show. At the mock tide pool, students crowded around tanks and stared 
with a mixture of awe, eagerness and trepidation as they waited to hold the 
crab and pet the dark, two-foot horn shark. 
</P>
<P>
 Students and teachers praised Wednesday's exhibit, which they called a 
valuable teaching tool. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at a book, its not as fun as when you get to touch things," 
said fifth-grade student Monique West, 11.  
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Richard Richards said the children were clearly excited by the exhibit 
and predicted they would maintain much of that interest once they returned to 
their classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just the fact that they're encouraged to touch things is important," he said. 
"Usually they hear just the opposite: 'Keep you hands to yourself.' " JON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; BALBOA BAY CLUB SEEKS OK FOR PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three years after having its $60-million expansion plans rejected by the City 
Council, the Balboa Bay Club tonight will seek approval of a smaller-scale 
project that calls for the demolition and reconstruction of most of the 
existing club facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The revised plan will be considered by the Planning Commission. It calls for 
opening a portion of the club for public use for the first time in its 46-year 
history by opening a 145-room hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The $25-million project also anticipates an expansion of the club from about 
155,000 square feet to about 189,000 square feet. It will include new, 
members-only athletics facilities, a public restaurant, coffee shop, two bars, 
a ballroom, four conference rooms and waterfront walkways. 
</P>
<P>
 "The facilities are out of date," said Dave Wooten, president of the 
International Bay Clubs, parent company of the Balboa Bay Club. "I think this 
will enable the Bay Club to continue in the next century in the same tradition 
as the past." The overall project seeks to modernize the club while also 
providing a better view of the ocean and the harbor to residents who live on 
the inland bluffs overlooking the club. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very pleased with the new plan," said John Sturgess, president of the 
Cliff Haven Community Assn., which represents 354 residents who live within 
eyeshot of the Bay Club. Sturgess, however, has some concern that the 
demolition and construction project will be disruptive because of noise from 
construction and traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the club's plan to nearly double its size was rejected by the City 
Council on a 4-3 vote because residents on those bluffs protested that the club 
would block their ocean views and congest traffic through the city on West 
Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The private Balboa Bay Club was built in 1948 and has been a bay-front haven 
for the rich and famous. It has never been open to non-members even though it 
sits on city-owned property along Mariner's Mile on West Coast Highway. As a 
part of the expansion, the Bay Club plans to ask for a 66-year extension of its 
lease with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, Bay Club officials say the opening stages of demolition will 
begin in about three to five years. BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; TARGET SHOOTERS HELP RAISE FUNDS FOR HOAG

 "It can feel like the longest three seconds of your life or the shortest 
nanosecond," said Bob Sparr, describing those crucial moments Wednesday when he 
made visual contact with his flying prey and raised his rifle toward the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never know which direction the birds are coming from," said Sparr, 56, of 
Corona del Mar."You go into an emotional state. You have to mount the gun, set 
the target and fire. It takes the right reflexes." 
</P>
<P>
 Sparr wasn't hunting in some remote country field, and those elusive birds 
were actually made out of clay. 
</P>
<P>
 He and about 100 other target shooters brought their weapons to the Orange 
County Shooting and Training Center in Irvine, where they blasted their way 
through an eight-event course to raise money for Hoag Memorial Hospital 
Presbyterian in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13th annual Invitational Stag Shoot was sponsored by the 552 Club, a 
nonprofit fund-raising arm of the Hoag Hospital Foundation. Organizers hoped to 
raise $30,000 during the event, which also included a silent auction. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants paid $220 each to take part in the shoot. The course included a 
"flurry" station in which several clay targets were released into the air at 
one time. Shooters tried to hit as many targets as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Another event required participants to shoot at targets moving on a horizontal 
track. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a lot of hand-eye coordination," Sparr said. "It builds a lot of 
camaraderie." 
</P>
<P>
 Funds from the event will help pay for a $6.7-million expansion of Hoag's 
emergency room. The expansion will increase the number of beds from 17 to 30, 
said Carol Heywood, the hospital's manager of public relations. The emergency 
room was designed to handle 17,000 patients a year but now cares for 42,000 
people annually, she said.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; OFFICER FACING TRIAL IN SLAYING RESIGNS

<P>
 A police officer awaiting a murder trial in Riverside in the fatal shooting of 
his wife has resigned from the department, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Derrick Tucker, 32, submitted his resignation Friday after being notified that 
steps were being taken to have him fired for violating the department's policy 
on handling weapons, Capt. David Abrecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker was arrested last month in the slaying of his wife, Simona Tucker, 21, 
in the bedroom of their Moreno Valley home on Mother's Day. The couple was 
married in 1991 and have a 9-month-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker, on the Garden Grove force since 1990, told investigators the shooting 
was an accident that happened while he and his wife were "playing with the gun" 
in bed. Police said investigators later discovered discrepancies in his story 
and he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is obviously a very serious case," Abrecht said. "(Tucker) violated his 
responsibilities as far as handling weapons. We were moving to terminate him 
and he decided it was in his best interest to resign." 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker is being held at Riverside County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail. A 
preliminary hearing is scheduled for July 1 in Riverside County Municipal 
Court. GREG HERNANDEZ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; HEARING TO PROBE NURSING HOME ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The county's state legislative delegation will conduct a public hearing Friday 
into allegations that state health authorities routinely ignore complaints 
about elder abuse in local nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing was organized by Assemblyman Gil Ferguson, whose district includes 
Leisure World, the nation's largest gated retirement community. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson said he and other local representatives were becoming increasingly 
concerned about reports that the state Department of Health Services, which 
licenses nursing homes, was not investigating complaints against some of the 
county's 67 nursing homes. The complaints ranged from neglect to 
life-threatening mistreatment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The assemblyman said testimony from social workers, nursing home officials and 
the public will determine whether the county's legislative delegation will push 
for new legislation or administrative actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We, as a society and as a government, give more money to take care of 
criminals in jails than we allow for our fathers and mothers who have to spend 
their last years in a home," Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides to the assemblyman said his office has received several complaints about 
the lax attitude of state health authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, only two local nursing homes were cited for serious violations. In 
Santa Clara County, which has a similar number of nursing homes as Orange 
County, 162 such citations were issued, a Ferguson aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This situation is like speeding," Ferguson said. "If you see people speeding, 
and not being punished, you would wonder why the police aren't writing tickets. 
In this case, we are wondering why no action is being taken on these 
complaints." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, a report issued by the nonprofit California Advocates for Nursing 
Homes stated that Orange County was one of the most problematic regions in the 
state. The advocacy group also noted that two of the 10 nursing homes listed as 
most deficient in providing care are in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 State health authorities didn't return a call for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The public hearing will be at Irvine City Hall at 9 a.m. DAVAN MAHARAJ

<P>
 The city's Art Commission this morning will discuss an oil painting that was 
abruptly removed from a City Hall exhibit Wednesday after an employee 
complained that it was offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 The painting, one of 30 put on display this week at the city's gallery, 
depicts a family in the 1930s sitting on a beach and eating watermelon. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kevin Murphy said he removed the painting after a city worker 
complained that it was stereotypical and demeaning to blacks. The figures in 
the work have brownish skin, but city officials said they didn't know whether 
the artist intended them to be white or black. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhibition organizers and art commissioners who viewed the painting said they 
assumed the family was white. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy said the painting will remain out of the exhibit until he further 
investigates the issue. "We don't want to do anything (counter to) promoting 
harmonious relations among ethnic groups."SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; STRAY TAKEOFFS CONCERN GRAND JURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Nearly 80% of all commercial aircraft leaving John Wayne Airport deviate from 
their takeoff route, posing some dangers to communities in Newport Beach, 
according to a report released by the Orange County Grand Jury on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury's report also encouraged airport authorities to install a 
beacon near the airport to guide aircraft away from neighborhoods where hot 
pieces of jet engines and other debris have fallen in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials disputed the panel's findings. They said they were 
inconsistent with the airport's records. 
</P>
<P>
 The takeoff route has been a source of constant controversy, especially among 
homeowners in the Dover Shores and Westcliff communities who complain that 
noisy aircraft fly dangerously close to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial planes leaving John Wayne are required to fly over Newport Bay to 
"limit noise impacts on the neighborhood . . . (and) provide greater safety to 
the people in those neighborhoods," the report stated. "Should a piece of a 
plane accidentally fall to earth during the first minutes of flight, it has a 
better chance of coming down into the bay, not in the neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
 But on two previous occasions, debris from planes have fallen in Dover Shores, 
which is more than a mile south of the runway. In 1988, fallen pieces of 
turbine blades "set roofs and shrubbery on fire, and sizzled in back-yard 
pools," the report states, noting that pieces of metal fell from another plane 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel suggested that navigational aids, including the beacon, could guide 
aircraft down the ideal departure path. 
</P>
<P>
 Seth Oberg, a retired pilot who is president of the Dover Shores Community 
Assn., said his group agreed with the recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 Oberg said that if the grand jury's recommendations are implemented, people 
who live under the departure path would be less fearful. 
</P>
<P>
 Courtney C. Wiercioch, a spokeswoman for the airport, said the grand jury's 
observations of the flight path's were "inconsistent with records of the 
airport's computerized flight tracking system." 
</P>
<P>
 But she declined to elaborate, saying airport officials plan to send a formal 
response to the panel. DAVAN MAHARAJ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; SOME LEFT AT SEA BY PHYSICS PROJECT

 Kneeling on the edge of Brea Olinda High School's pool Wednesday, Sydney Witt 
clasped his hands tight and prayed that his boat would stay afloat during the 
third annual student boat race. 
</P>
<P>
 He and 135 other physics students built 34 boats as part of a class project on 
buoyancy. The boats were made out of thin wooden sticks, paper, glue and paint. 
</P>
<P>
 The boats were built in various shapes and sizes, with names like Nerd Power, 
No Fear, Barbie Dream Boat and The Blue Sausage. 
</P>
<P>
 Witt's boat, the USS Brownlee, made it across the pool with teacher Jill 
Brownlee aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Others were not as lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 About half the boats sank or fell apart in the water. Several teachers and 
administrators who were part of the experiment got soaked in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 The boats were built by teams of four students each, starting in February when 
the project was assigned by physics teacher Mary Lee Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Students were not allowed to ride in the boats, Davis said. She said students 
had to get a teacher, administrator or community leader to race the boats. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea Olinda Unified School District Supt. Edgar Z. Seal, Assistant Supt. Peter 
J. Boothroyd, school board President Susie Sokol and other district officials 
were among volunteers to race the boats. Most of the other racers were teachers 
or business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The water proved too much for many of the boats as racers paddled with their 
arms to navigate the 75-foot length of the pool. Davis said most of the boats 
sank because they were too big. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the boat gets all the way across, that's an A," Davis said. "If it just 
floats but can't get across, that's a B, and if it rips or sinks, that's a C." 
</P>
<P>
 No Ds or Fs though, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrea Chanawatr, 17, got a B because her team's boat didn't fall apart until 
it was halfway across, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good way to put what you know about physics to work in real life," 
Chanawatr said. "It's more fun than just reading about it in a book." 
</P>
<P>
 The boats were being inspected after the race and the winning boat makers will 
be announced today, Davis said. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; HOUSING MORATORIUM AFFECTS 'IN-FILL' 
LOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has enacted a 45-day moratorium on housing construction on 
certain types of lots in the city following complaints from Huntington Seacliff 
residents that new homes being built in their area are detrimental to the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen residents voiced concerns during Monday's council meeting about 
the new homes, some of which are being built on "oil islands" that once 
contained drilling rigs and machinery. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents called the new two-story homes monstrosities that tower above the 
existing one-story homes, built more than 20 years ago. They also said the 
homes -- built with expansive windows -- invade their privacy and harm views 
and property values. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just that they're so big, massive and tall, and the result is what we 
consider a visual intrusion and it's got people concerned," said Jeff Metzel, 
president of Huntington Seacliff Homeowners' Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Metzel said that while the new homes are beautiful, they don't fit in with the 
existing neighborhood of 314 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's council vote, while directed at the Huntington Seacliff neighborhood, 
affects the entire city, temporarily banning issuance of building permits for 
new single-family homes on so-called "in-fill" lots in areas that are mostly 
developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Melanie S. Fallon, director of community development, said no building permits 
will be issued until the council adopts a new ordinance to ensure that new 
homes are compatible with existing homes in a neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents contend that the new Huntington Seacliff homes, while in accord with 
existing zoning, should have come under a city provision that mandates a 
conditional-use permit and hearing before construction of homes more than 25 
feet high. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Zanic, vice president of New Urban West, a partner in Seacliff Partners, 
developer of the homes, expressed surprise at the temporary ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are reviewing the comments of the City Council and we will be meeting with 
staff and assessing how we move forward," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seacliff Partners plans to build a total of 120 homes in the area off Golden 
West Street, with about half in the Huntington Seacliff neighborhood. So far, 
33 have either been built or are under construction, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Lichman, an attorney representing Huntington Seacliff Homeowners' 
Assn., said residents are pleased at the moratorium. She said the houses, 
because of their height, should have gone through a special permit process or 
received a conditional-use permit. Without such a review, she said, residents 
were unaware of the size of the homes that would be developed in their 
neighborhood.DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; GIRLS' SCREAMS DETER MOLESTATION ATTEMPT 
</P>

<P>
 A man sought by the Orange County Sheriff's Department for harassing children 
over the past three months is suspected of attempting to molest two girls on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The incidents have panicked parents in the normally quiet neighborhoods in 
Dana Point and prompted one elementary school to send warning letters home with 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Hal Brotheim, who heads the sheriff's sex crimes division, said the man 
pretends to have lost a cat or a dog, then asks children for help in finding 
the animal. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, 7-year-old twin girls were approached with a similar story while 
playing in front of their home at Calle Naranja and Calle Real by a man 
described as being in his early 20s, with long, brown hair and an acne-scarred 
face. 
</P>
<P>
 The children were drawn to the bottom of a slope behind their house. Brotheim 
said the man touched one of the girls on the head and told her to be a lookout. 
The girls began yelling for help and ran from the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents are feeling pretty upset about the fact that there is a child 
molester loose in our neighborhood," said one woman, who added that her 
daughter was molested recently by a man using a similar ruse. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who lives near Palisades Elementary School, said her daughter was 
approached near her house. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told her that he lost his kitty and went to some bushes in the side of our 
house," said the woman. The woman said the man forced the girl to touch him. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl has received treatment for trauma stemming from the incident and 
family members said they will be moving from the neighborhood next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the incidents have occurred near Palisades Elementary School. The 
others were near the playing fields at Dana Point Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's molestation attempt was the second such incident reported in the 
past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 25, a man saying he had lost his cat approached two children at Del 
Obispo Park. Sheriff's investigators said only that the youths became 
frightened by the man and left. 
</P>
<P>
 The park is about two miles from Palisades Elementary School, which has sent 
two warning letters to parents in the past two weeks, including one sent home 
Wednesday.FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; ANTI-GANG DRESS CODE TENTATIVELY APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trustees of the Los Alamitos Unified School District have tentatively approved 
a new dress code that would ban gang-style clothing, even though they insisted 
there is no gang problem in local schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The new policy, approved this week, would affect more than 7,200 students in 
the school district's seven elementary, one middle school and two high schools. 
Final approval could come when the school board meets June 20. 
</P>
<P>
 If adopted, the new dress code would take effect next school year. 
</P>
<P>
 But trustees left it to the principals and the safety committee of each 
school, which includes parents, to define what constitutes gang-related 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Supt. Lorie Gonia said that the safety school panels will seek the 
help of the police to determine the clothing styles and colors that would be 
prohibited. She said it's possible that schools would have different standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not saying there is gang activity in the school campuses," Gonia said. 
"But there is gang activity in the community. We want to be proactive." 
</P>
<P>
 Under a current dress code, a student who goes to school dirty and untidy may 
be sent home or required to tidy up before entering the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Also prohibited are articles of clothing that may be unsafe, such as long, 
loose sleeves -- or hair -- worn while operating a machine or working near an 
open fire. Clothing with obscene or sexually suggestive words or pictures are 
not allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fashion dictates what kids wear," Trustee Del Clark said. "The schools can 
make the call as to what colors and style are acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees said that the ban on gang clothing is not intended to violate the 
students' civil rights or dictate fashion style or taste. But they said that 
wearing gang-related apparel threatens the health and safety of the school 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Keith Polakoff said that although gangs are not a problem now, they 
could be someday. "People should look ahead, rather than wait for things to 
happen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several school districts in Orange County, including Santa Ana, Garden Grove 
and Tustin, have adopted policies prohibiting gang-related attire. 
</P>
<P>
 Among gang-influenced clothing identified by other school districts are 
oversized black pants, Los Angeles Raiders jackets, loose shirts and red or 
blue athletic shoes.BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; SCHOOL TRUSTEES OK BOND OFFERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 School district trustees this week unanimously approved a $1.5-million bond 
sale to help finance the renovation of science classrooms at Los Alamitos High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be the third bond offering under Measure K, which voters approved in 
1990 to raise $13 million to pay for major repairs of the Los Alamitos School 
District's aging schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The first issue in 1990 raised $9 million, the second last year raised $1.7 
million, and the remaining $800,000 could be sold in about eight years, 
according to Ronald Murrey, the school district's business manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Murrey said that money raised from the bond offerings were used to repair 
electrical systems and install new roofs, heating and air-conditioning systems 
at Hopkinson, McGaugh and Rossmoor elementary schools, McAuliffe Middle School 
and Laurel High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The average age of the schools is 29 years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the new bond sale, "all our projects would have been completed, and all 
the schools would have been renovated," Murrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials said that new science classrooms are needed at Los 
Alamitos High because of increasing enrollment and to meet the new state 
curriculum requirements that emphasize science. 
</P>
<P>
 About 180 new students are expected at the high school next year. It has 2,500 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the science classrooms, 10 portable classrooms are also needed 
at the school, Murrey said. The project would cost $2.2 million. The school 
district has money set aside for the project in addition to the $1.2 million 
expected from the bond sale, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure K raised property taxes within the Los Alamitos Unified School 
District area by an average of $4.50 a month for the next 25 years. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; BODY OF SLAIN MAN FOUND IN APARTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The body of a 23-year-old man who had been shot to death was discovered in his 
apartment Wednesday just after midnight. It was found by a friend who broke 
into the apartment because he was worried at not having seen the victim for 
several days. 
</P>
<P>
 Police identified the victim as Arash Nakhjavani, who had been shot in the 
head and torso. They said he may have been dead for several days. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Curran, a neighbor in the apartment building in the 25000 block of Cross 
Creek Drive, said, "We hadn't seen him (Nakhjavani) in a few days but just 
thought maybe he was out of town. We were sleeping and all of a sudden we heard 
his buddy screaming, 'He's dead!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Police Sgt. Ed McDonald said there did not appear to have been an earlier 
forced entry and that robbery probably wasn't involved in the slaying because 
valuables had not been taken from the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's possible that he knew the person who shot him but we don't know for 
sure," McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they had yet to uncover any suspects. An autopsy was to have been 
performed Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Nakhjavani moved into the apartment about a month ago and had not been 
involved in any problems, according to his neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a young guy on his own," Curran said. "He was a nice guy -- the kind 
of neighbor who would say hello and ask how you're doing. He had invited me 
over for a beer but I never made it over there." 
</P>
<P>
 Police and residents said violence is uncommon in the sprawling, 
Mediterranean-style apartment complex on the eastern edge of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you live in a neighborhood like this, you don't expect these kinds of 
things to happen," Curran said. "That's why you pay the money, so you feel 
relaxed and safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Nakhjavani's death is the first homicide in Yorba Linda in 1994. The city had 
one homicide last year, McDonald said.GREG HERNANDEZ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; ST. MARGARET'S WINS 11 DRAMA AWARDS 
</P>

<P>
 A private school's debut performance in a Southland drama competition won rave 
reviews as judges handed out 11 awards to students from St. Margaret's 
Episcopal School -- the most by an Orange County school. 
</P>
<P>
 In an awards ceremony at Plummer Auditorium in Fullerton last week, three St. 
Margaret's students won outstanding achievement awards in the annual Macy 
contest, which recognizes the best school musical productions. 
</P>
<P>
 During the school year, judges attend plays at public and private schools 
throughout Southern California. St. Margaret's was evaluated for its production 
of "Fiddler on the Roof." 
</P>
<P>
 "St. Margaret's students showed remarkable talent and truly earned their Macy 
Awards," said Lee Childress, who founded the competition with her husband in 
1971. "It is so refreshing to see the wonderful talent that is being cultivated 
in our local high schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Blumberg, Kimberly Helms and Chase McLaughlin were given Outstanding 
Achievement awards for their performances. Other winners included Charles 
Chaney, Ashlea Scott, Jerome Shirar, Joanna Fee, Caroline Metherell, Dominic 
Ondryas, Esther Rodriguez and Blaire Notrica. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is quite rewarding to have our students recognized for not only their 
talent, but their hard work and dedication to the dramatic arts," said Bob 
Conrad, a drama teacher at St. Margaret's. "I've been very fortunate to work 
with such a talented group of young actors and actresses."FRANK MESSINA

THE ORANGE COUNTY VOTE; OUTCOME IN DANA POINT UNCERTAIN PENDING TALLY OF FINAL 
ABSENTEE BALLOTS; RESULTS: WITH ALL PRECINCTS COUNTED, ONLY 69 VOTES SEPARATE 
TOP 4 IN RACE FOR 3 COUNCIL SEATS.

<P>
 In a race still too close to call Wednesday, Toni Gallagher, Karen Lloreda and 
Harold R. Kaufman appear to have been elected to the Dana Point City Council, 
an outcome reflecting the community's division over the Headlands development 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallagher was the top finisher with 2,604 votes, followed by incumbent 
Councilwoman Lloreda with 2,576 and Kaufman with 2,555. Three council seats 
were open. 
</P>
<P>
 Although all voting precincts have been counted, final absentee ballots and 
write-in votes remain to be tallied. The final count could change the election 
results, as Ernest A. Nelson and Bill Shepherd were right behind the apparent 
winners with 2,535 and 2,416 votes, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 With only 69 votes separating the top four finishers, none of the candidates 
Wednesday were declaring victory or conceding defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "There could still be a complete shift in these results," said Nelson, who was 
narrowly defeated in a similarly tight council race in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor were many conclusions to be drawn for those who regarded this year's 
council vote as a precursor to an upcoming referendum on the controversial 
$500-million development proposed for the Dana Point Headlands. The 
council-approved plan, calling for a 400-room hotel and 370 homes on the 
121-acre Headlands peninsula, will be the subject of a citywide vote in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallagher, a founder of the Save the Headlands group and an outspoken opponent 
of the development, finished first -- but was followed closely by Lloreda and 
Kaufman, who support the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallagher on Wednesday sharply criticized last-minute campaign spending by the 
Concerned Taxpayers of Dana Point political action committee, a group sponsored 
by the owners of the Headlands peninsula, Newport Beach-based M.H. Sherman Co. 
and Pasadena-based Chandis Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
 (Chandis Securities, a firm that oversees the financial holdings of the 
Chandler family, is a major stockholder in Times Mirror Co., which publishes 
the Los Angeles Times.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I see the whole election as a battle between local residents and enormous, 
megabuck outside interests," said Gallagher, who lives on the Headlands and, 
under conflict-of-interest rules, wouldn't be able to vote on the issue as a 
council member. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very concerned about these outside interests trying to buy our City 
Council election," Gallagher said. "I hope the people in Dana Point will wake 
up and realize the huge special interests are what we have to fight in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Daniels of Laguna Beach, the president of M.H. Sherman Co., said his 
company has owned property in Dana Point for more than 50 years and is not an 
"outside interest." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't consider ourselves out-of-towners," said Daniels, adding that he has 
lived near the Headlands for 22 years. "We have a significant investment in 
Dana Point and are very interested in a well-run city government. We are 
pleased we were able to help Karen Lloreda and Howard Kaufman and we believe 
they are very qualified candidates . . . but we offer our congratulations to 
all the successful candidates and look forward to working with all three of 
them." According to City Clerk Sharon Waits, the Concerned Taxpayers group 
spent nearly $11,500 in the last few days before the election on mailers 
supporting Lloreda, Kaufman and Shepherd. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite months of debate about the Headlands, and a petition drive to put the 
referendum on the ballot, only about 30% of the city's registered voters came 
to the polls Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the most disappointing outlook was the poor turnout," said Lloreda, a 
Capistrano Beach resident. "There evidently wasn't a huge interest or a big 
concern about the Headlands or any of the other issues. People were not so 
unhappy that they showed up in droves to vote."

 Two Democratic congressional candidates, a scant 142 votes apart, remained 
hopeful of victory Wednesday as the registrar of voters conducted a 
ballot-by-ballot count of absentee votes to decide who will challenge incumbent 
Rep. Robert K. Dornan. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Farber, a heavily endorsed Santa Ana businessman, is narrowly ahead of 
Robert John Banuelos, with 4,625 votes or about 29% of the vote. Banuelos, a 
Santa Ana senior citizens counselor, received 4,483 for 28.1% of the 46th 
Congressional District's Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 2,000 absentee votes remain to be counted -- all that arrived at 
the county registrar's after June 4, a registrar spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well we haven't won yet," Farber said guardedly. "When the absentees are 
counted we will celebrate, but only after making sure." 
</P>
<P>
 In early returns on Tuesday evening, Banuelos took a substantial lead, but as 
the evening and the ballot counting progressed, that gap closed.  
</P>
<P>
 "It could go either way," Banuelos said in a telephone interview Wednesday. 
"So everyone is optimistic until it's all counted." 
</P>
<P>
 Nine-term incumbent Dornan had no Republican challengers this year and, 
according to the most recent campaign finance statements, has raised nearly 
$473,000 since Jan. 1, more than seven times the amount raised by Farber, the 
best-financed Democrat in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Libertarian candidate Richard G. Newhouse will also face Dornan in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Farber and Banuelos, who lead a field of six Democrats, both said they pushed 
hard at the end of the campaign to remain in contention. Farber pointed to an 
aggressive, last-minute four-piece mail campaign and having his name on four 
separate slate mailers. Banuelos said he targeted absentee voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only did we push absentee ballots ourselves," Banuelos said, "but various 
community centers in the district also stressed a vote-at-home program and it 
was one of the tools we used." 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Warner, Orange County registrar elections supervisor, said that 
signatures on the county's estimated 25,000 absentee ballots sent in on 
Tuesday's election are being confirmed and the slow process of counting has 
begun, though final results are not expected until late Friday at the earliest, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no runoffs in these partisan primaries, Warner said, so the "person 
who gets the most votes wins." 
</P>
<P>
 "As of right now, we're trying to get the signatures that are on the absentee 
ballots verified," Warner said. "Nothing will be done in the way of putting out 
any information until Monday or at the earliest, late Friday." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 41st Congressional District, which takes in part of northern Orange 
County and sections of Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties, Rep. Jay C. Kim 
(R-Diamond Bar) successfully beat back a challenge from Todd R. Thakar, an 
attorney from Orange, who had 23% of the vote to Kim's 33.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Democratic side, urban redeveloper Ed Tessier beat Richard Waldron. 
</P>
<P>
 The four other Republican incumbents in Orange County, Reps. Christopher Cox 
of Newport Beach, Ron Packard of Carlsbad, Edward R. Royce of Fullerton, and 
Dana Rohrabacher of Huntington Beach, easily won.  
</P>
<P>
 In November, Cox will face Democrat Gary Kingsbury of Irvine, and Libertarian 
Victor A. Wagner Jr. of Mission Viejo. Packard will be challenged by Democrat 
Andrei Leschick of Valley Center and Peace and Freedom candidate Donna White of 
San Diego. Royce faces Libertarian Jack Harris Dean of Fullerton and Democrat 
R.O. (Bob) Davis of Buena Park. Rohrabacher faces Democrat Brett Williamson of 
Costa Mesa.

THE ORANGE COUNTY VOTE; VOTERS GIVE JUDGE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT; COURTS: WHITNEY 
EASILY WINS REELECTION DESPITE MISCONDUCT CHARGES. DUTCHER FACES RUNOFF WITH 
LEE.

<P>
 A Municipal Court judge facing misconduct charges easily won reelection 
Tuesday, while another incumbent judge will face a county prosecutor in a 
runoff in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge Claude E. Whitney in Santa Ana still faces charges, filed by 
the state Commission on Judicial Performance, that he barred defendants from 
seeking out defense counsel and violated other constitutional rights. But 
Whitney said Wednesday that the results of Tuesday's election show the public 
believes -- as he does -- that he did nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the people realize that I have a job to do and I take it very 
seriously," said Whitney, who received 55.3% of the vote, according to 
semi-official results. "I am a fair judge, I enjoy my work and I feel very 
privileged to have an opportunity to serve the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitney's opponent, defense attorney Dennis Patrick O'Connell, centered his 
campaign on the controversy and asked voters to elect a judge who would follow 
the law. O'Connell received 44% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there was a lot of information lacking out there," said O'Connell, 
who said he also blamed his loss on voter apathy. "But I don't think this is an 
endorsement of Whitney's conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 In the county's most heated judicial election, in the Westminster court 
office, Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Caryl Lee received 38.1% of the vote 
to incumbent Municipal Judge Dan C. Dutcher's 38%. A third candidate, attorney 
Barry S. Brown, got 23.3%. Lee and Dutcher will face each other in a runoff on 
Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I look at it, 63% of the voters cast their ballot against Dutcher," 
said attorney Bruce Bridgman, who is running Lee's campaign. He has criticized 
Dutcher as being too lenient at sentencing and complained that Dutcher's 
campaign literature has been misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 "Caryl got the most votes, she has the support of law enforcement and we will 
continue to campaign hard until she wins the election," Bridgman said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dutcher's treasurer, attorney Jennifer Keller, said the opposition has 
been running a smear campaign and is taking advantage of a sitting judge who is 
barred by judicial ethics from responding to the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been a sleazy campaign from beginning to end," said Keller, who added 
that Dutcher's 12 years on the bench make him the more experienced candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 In other judicial races, Municipal Judge Pamela L. Iles in Laguna Niguel 
easily defeated Mission Viejo attorney John C. Connolly, collecting 64.4% of 
the vote to his 35.1%. Connolly's campaign centered on the theme that a 
"change" was needed, while Iles focused on her experience on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very grateful to the voters of South Orange County for overlooking the 
campaign rhetoric and basing their decision on my record," Iles said. "I plan 
to serve them as vigorously as in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 In the only race for an open seat on the Orange County Superior Court, 
Municipal Judge Gary P. Ryan in Santa Ana defeated fellow Municipal Judge B. 
Tam Nomoto, with 60.3% of the vote to her 39.1%.

ANAHEIM TO RELEASE PLANS TO UPGRADE DISNEYLAND AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials today will release details of a massive planning document that 
is aimed at revitalizing and modernizing the area surrounding Disneyland and 
its proposed $3-billion expansion project. 
</P>
<P>
 The document, which has been four years in the making, is a companion piece to 
the elaborate Disneyland Resort project and sets strict zoning, height, 
density, landscaping and other guidelines for about 550 acres around the park. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the most significant planning steps Anaheim has ever taken," 
said Mayor Tom Daly. "It involves a major cleanup and face lift for the most 
traveled and economically important part of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly said the document, known as a specific plan, is "as complete a planning 
process there is. It's state of the art planning." 
</P>
<P>
 The document calls for putting utility lines underground, wider setbacks 
between the street and buildings, as well as uniformity in landscaping and 
signage. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the area covered by the specific plan is a deteriorating urban sprawl 
made up of run-down hotels and cheap tourist shops.  
</P>
<P>
 The Walt Disney Co. has long been annoyed by the condition of the city 
surrounding its border and has consulted with city officials on the overall 
planning for the area. This area will become even more important to Disney if 
it goes through with plans to build a resort with more than 5,000 hotel rooms, 
a large shopping district, an amphitheater and a new theme park next to 
Disneyland, called Westcot. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim officials said more details on the document, as well as futuristic 
renditions of streets and building in the area, will be released today. The 
entire document is schedule to be released next week. The specific plan 
requires at least two public hearings and votes by both the city's Planning 
Commission and City Council for approval.

REPORT ON JAILED IMMIGRANTS SPARKS APOLOGY; GRAND JURY: AN ERROR IN WORDING 
OVERSTATES BY FOUR TIMES THE NUMBER OF ILLEGAL FELONS IN COUNTY FACILITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Grand Jury apologized Wednesday for an error in a report 
that dramatically overstated the number of illegal immigrants in the county 
jail, and said the report seeks federal reimbursement for the cost of 
incarcerating all felons who are not citizens -- whether they are in the 
country legally or not. 
</P>
<P>
 The report released Tuesday incorrectly said 27% of the county's inmates are 
illegal immigrants, more than four times the number of inmates identified as 
illegal immigrants during a two-day sampling visit by grand jury members to 
county jails, said Lt. Dan Martini, spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury is correcting the report's wording, said juror Leo Arranaga, 
who was in charge of the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, drafted to address the issue of overcrowding and early release of 
inmates, prompted an outcry from local Latino activists, who chided the grand 
jury for feeding the anti-immigrant frenzy bolstered over the past year by 
politicians statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their objective was to request the federal government to pay for its fair 
share of jail costs. We don't have any problem with that, but the way it's been 
presented it makes it appear that immigrants are the cause of overcrowding," 
said John Palacio, leadership program director for the Mexican American Legal 
Defense and Education Fund in Santa Ana.  
</P>
<P>
 "When you have a public that's not educated and tends to blame immigrants for 
everything that's wrong in America, this creates a hysteria. It makes it seem 
that immigrants are criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 Grand jury foreman Frank V. Kroeger said the report wasn't meant as a slight 
to immigrants, but rather as a possible way to recoup tax dollars for Orange 
County's residents. The panel suggested that lawmakers avoid using the terms 
alien, illegal immigrant or undocumented immigrant and instead refer to 
immigrants in custody as "non-citizen felons," which the grand jury said has a 
less-negative connotation. 
</P>
<P>
 The report called on the Board of Supervisors to pay for a task force to study 
the impact of non-citizen felons on the county jail system, and sought the 
transfer of those inmates to federal prisons or reimbursement from the federal 
government for their incarceration.  
</P>
<P>
 It also called on the board to promote legislation that would require law 
enforcement officers to ask every inmate about their citizenship status. All 
non-citizens, including legal residents currently applying for citizenship, are 
the responsibility of the federal government, which should pay to incarcerate 
them, Arranaga said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because taxpayers have the burden of paying for non-citizen felons, we're 
recommending that the Board of Supervisors urge the federal government to 
assume the responsibility, so the burden is reduced. The rights of the 
non-citizen are limited," Arranaga said.  
</P>
<P>
 Martini said the grand jury based its figures on a survey of a little more 
than half the county jail population. The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization 
Service assisted with the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the inmates surveyed, 27% were described as non-citizens and 6% were 
illegal immigrants. On an average day, 4% of the county's jail population is 
identified by the INS as undocumented, Martini said, but federal immigration 
officials estimate the number of illegal immigrants in Orange County jails at 
closer to 12% to 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 It is that very confusion over numbers that leads the backlash against all 
immigrants, whether they are in the county legally or not, said Irene Martinez, 
a founding member of the nascent Orange County Alliance for Immigrant Rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "A legal resident is here legally and should have the same rights, except the 
right to vote, as a citizen," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The blunder marks the second time in as many years that the panel has raised 
the ire of Latino activists by issuing a report related to immigration. The 
1992-93 grand jury was blasted by local minority groups for a report blaming 
illegal immigration for many of the county's social ills. 
</P>
<P>
 To soften those criticisms, the current grand jury launched an unprecedented 
recruitment campaign to diversify the ethnic makeup of the coming jury.  
</P>
<P>
 Kroeger said he hoped the controversy over Tuesday's report would not dilute 
those efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thrust is to talk about felons who are non-citizens and the federal 
government's failure to do something about it, and that's falling on the backs 
of the taxpayers of Orange County," he said.

DEFENSE EXPERT SAYS INFANT WAS DEAD BEFORE RAT BIT HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 4-month-old boy, bitten more than 100 times by a pet rat, was dead before 
the animal attacked him, a forensic pathologist for the defense testified 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Thomas Henry, the chief medical examiner for the coroner's office in 
Denver, disputed the conclusion of Orange County's deputy coroner who said the 
boy bled to death as a starving rat was feasting on his arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my opinion that the baby was dead at the time he received the (rat bite) 
injuries," said Henry, who said he believed Steven Giguere Jr. died of sudden 
infant death syndrome, or SIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's parents, Kathyleen and Steven Giguere Sr., are on trial in Superior 
Court for involuntary manslaughter and child endangerment in the death of their 
son last August and face up to six years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors contend that the Gigueres, who were homeless and living in a 
filthy, trash-strewn station wagon, were criminally negligent by allowing the 
rat -- who had a history of biting people -- to roam free in the car. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple was not around when the rat sank its teeth into an artery in the 
baby's hand causing him to bleed to death, prosecutors allege. 
</P>
<P>
 But Henry rejected that scenario, testifying that photographs of the dead boy, 
depicting the skin color around the bite marks, are inconsistent with bleeding 
to death. Henry said there were also signs of blood pooling, which indicated 
the boy may have been dead prior to the rat attack. Additionally, Henry said, 
blood and skin samples taken from the baby lacked certain chemical reactions 
that generally occur when a body bleeds to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Under cross-examination, however, Henry conceded that the rat bites were 
severe enough to cause the baby's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry, the first witness in the defense's case, also acknowledged that the 
baby lacked several of the telltale medical signs found in more than 80% of 
SIDS cases. SIDS is a mysterious condition that takes the lives of apparently 
healthy infants. 
</P>
<P>
 Expressing incredulity, Deputy Dist. Atty. Jim Tanizaki asked Henry if he 
thought "it was just a coincidence" that the baby died of SIDS and then 
immediately was attacked by the rat. "Is that your opinion?" he asked 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's what happened," Henry responded. 
</P>
<P>
 An expert on rats also testified, saying that a rodent, even a starving one, 
may not have been able to continually bite a live baby. 
</P>
<P>
 William B. Jackson, a professor of ecology from Bowling Green University in 
Ohio, said rats would be deterred from striking anything that moved or even 
cried or screamed around them. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's any motion . . . that's going to disturb the rat and cause it to 
retreat," Jackson said. "It the motion was frequent it might discourage feeding 
altogether."

BOARD WEIGHS APPEAL IN SCHOOL ACTIVITIES CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Irvine school officials are trying to determine whether other school boards 
around the state want them to appeal a court decision that found the district's 
eligibility policy for cheerleaders to be unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4th District Court of Appeal ruled last month that the school district 
should create a uniform eligibility criteria to cover all students who 
participate in extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Under current policy, student athletes must maintain a 2.0 grade-point average 
out of a possible 4.0, while cheerleaders and student government members must 
maintain a 2.5 average. 
</P>
<P>
 Superintendent David E. Brown said Wednesday that the court ruling has 
statewide implications because other districts have similar two-tier 
eligibility rules. 
</P>
<P>
 In Irvine, the more difficult criterion is reserved for students -- like 
cheerleaders -- whose activities run for more than one semester. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has asked the California School Board Assn. whether its members 
want Irvine to appeal the decision. The association is made up of school 
officials from across the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to know what other districts have to say about this," said Brown, 
adding that Irvine would be unlikely to pursue the appeal if other districts 
don't express interest and support. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine school board is set to decide the issue on June 29. 
</P>
<P>
 The May court decision related to a suit filed several years ago by a 
Woodbridge High School yell squad leader who was forced off the team after her 
grade-point average dropped below 2.5. SHELBY GRAD

NEWS ANALYSIS; WILSON OUTPOLLS BROWN ON O.C. PARTY SUPPORT; POLITICS: GOVERNOR 
FARING MUCH BETTER WITH LOCAL REPUBLICANS THAN HIS RIVAL IS AMONG COUNTY 
DEMOCRATS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Like the rest of the state, Orange County voters apparently held their noses 
Tuesday when they chose Republican Gov. Pete Wilson and Democratic state 
Treasurer Kathleen Brown to lead their party's tickets in the November general 
election, according to exit polling by the Los Angeles Times Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 But of the two, the poll found Wilson in much better standing among local 
Republicans than Brown is with the Democrats, although Orange County GOP voters 
expressed disaffection with Wilson by giving his relatively unknown opponent, 
Ron Unz, almost 43% of the vote in the primary election. 
</P>
<P>
 On a hot local issue that is expected to be on the Orange County ballot in 
November, local voters were split on whether a commercial airport should be 
developed at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station: one-fourth said they remain 
undecided on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County primary voters, asked which two issues most swayed their vote, 
had the same concerns as statewide voters: 38% listed crime as their top issue, 
followed by illegal immigration. Local voters were more worried about illegal 
immigration than their counterparts statewide, with 32% listing it first, 
compared to 24% throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime and illegal immigration are the two issues Wilson focused on during his 
primary campaign and the two that proved a weakness for Brown, according to the 
poll, which surveyed 1,209 local voters as they left their polling places 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Wilson has his work cut out for him in Orange County, where statewide 
GOP candidates usually need more than a 2-to-1 margin in the general election 
to offset the Democratic strongholds in the Los Angeles and the San Francisco 
Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to choose who they would vote for in November, Orange County primary 
voters picked Wilson by 55%, compared to 24% for Brown -- a clear majority -- 
but perhaps not enough to ensure victory for Wilson in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The incumbent governor's job rating among all local voters was at 41% -- just 
one point higher than statewide, and his approval score among local Republicans 
was 54%, compared to 60% for Republicans statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 The statewide general election campaign for governor will be fought by Brown 
and Wilson from their trenches in the center of the political spectrum. Both 
are middle-of-the-road politicians, moderate on most issues. They will do 
battle for the potential crossover voter, independents, Ronald Reagan Democrats 
and moderate Republican women. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Orange County, Wilson faces the tricky challenge of appealing to the 
center while attracting votes from both moderate and conservative Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 In an election night analysis of the high vote for Unz, local GOP Chairman 
Thomas Fuentes cautioned Wilson to heed the warning of local Republicans and 
adopt a more conservative message. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost two of every five Republicans apparently held their noses while voting 
for Wilson, calling him the "best of a bad lot." Despite those numbers, and the 
strong showing by Unz, Wilson emerged from the primary with solid support from 
party conservatives and those over 65, who are generally considered 
conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll showed that 53% of GOP conservatives said they voted for Wilson, and 
he also received a whopping 70% from voters over 65. The governor also won the 
support of 57% of the women. 
</P>
<P>
 When given a choice between Brown and Wilson, "Republican conservative voters 
rush back to Wilson even though many cast their ballots for Unz," said John 
Brennan, who conducted the Times Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Three-fourths of the local GOP voters, who are more conservative than 
Republicans statewide, "will come home to Wilson in November," Brennan said, 
with only 9% saying they would cross party lines to vote for Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, the numbers are similar: 72% of Republicans said they will back the 
governor in the fall, with only 10% favoring Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 By Wednesday, as local Republican leaders gathered to honor Wilson at a "unity 
reception," Fuentes was sounding more certain that the party could unite behind 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done it time and time again for Pete in Orange County and we're 
prepared to do it again," he said. "Orange County will rally again." 
</P>
<P>
 On the Democratic side, support for Brown's candidacy among her own party's 
voters is much softer in Orange County than it is statewide. But Orange County 
is not as critical for Democrats as it is for the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, 53% of the Democrats said they would back her in November, while almost 
one-fourth said they would defect to Wilson; 24% said they are unsure. 
Statewide, three out of five Democrats said they would stay with Brown in the 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown is vulnerable in Orange County on the issues of crime and illegal 
immigration, and she apparently failed to appeal to conservative or even some 
moderate Democrats here and statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 While Brown defeated her nearest opponent, Insurance Commissioner John 
Garamendi, by almost 11 points in local balloting, Garamendi received a solid 
majority of support from voters who listed crime and immigration as their top 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, those points "were not even on the issues list" two years ago when 
the economy dominated the presidential debate, Brennan said. And when local 
voters were asked if they were financially better off or worse than they were 
four years ago, only one-fifth of the voters said "better," according to the 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
 During the primary campaign, Brown spoke mainly about the need to fix the 
education system and improve the state's economy -- issues that ranked fourth 
and fifth in the eyes of local voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Brown, U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein does not get many Republican crossover 
voters in Orange County. Only 8% of the local GOP voters said they would leave 
their nominee, Rep. Michael Huffington (R-Santa Barbara) to support her. 
Conversely, Huffington draws 22% of the local Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, who defeated his nearest rival, former Fullerton Congressman 
William E. Dannemeyer by 10 points in local balloting, did slightly better 
among local party conservatives than Dannemeyer, and was strongly backed by the 
elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 On the El Toro question, the strongest support for a commercial airport came 
from men, with 44% saying they favor the proposed November initiative, and 
about one-third voicing opposition. Almost half the women voters said they 
oppose the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, in both the Democratic and Republican primaries, a majority of local 
voters in Tuesday's election were older than 50 years of age, which is 
indicative of the record low turnout in the county. Almost 90% were white, with 
Latino and Asia American voters each casting about 5% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Tammerlin Drummond contributed to this report. How the Poll 
Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 5,234 voters, including 2,656 Democratic primary 
and 2,275 Republican primary voters as they exited 110 polling places across 
the state. The poll included an over-sample of 1,209 Orange County voters, 
including 405 Democrats and 741 Republicans interviewed at 25 county polling 
places. Precincts were chosen based on the pattern of turnout in past primary 
elections. The survey was by confidential questionnaire. The margin of sampling 
error for percentages based on the entire statewide sample is plus or minus 
three percentage points; for the Orange County sample it is four points. For 
some subgroups the error margin may be somewhat higher. Because the survey does 
not include absentee voters or those who declined to participate when 
approached, actual returns and demographic estimates by the interviewers were 
used to slightly adjust the sample. Assisting The Times in this exit poll was

BREWER CLAIMS VICTORY IN O.C. ASSEMBLY RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BRAZIL and FERNANDO ROMERO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Still clinging to a narrow lead over her nearest opponent, businesswoman 
Marilyn C. Brewer on Wednesday declared herself winner of the hotly contested 
70th Assembly District Republican primary, the survivor -- for now -- of a 
near-even split of votes among three candidates, the other two of whom had 
touted their conservative credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all done," said Brewer's campaign consultant, Harvey A. Englander. 
"Marilyn is the Republican candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 But attorney Thomas G. Reinecke, who was in second place after votes were 
counted Tuesday, did not concede victory to Brewer while an undetermined number 
of absentee votes remained to be counted. A Reinecke campaign official said the 
candidate was, in fact, "confident" he would follow his father, former Lt. Gov. 
Ed Reinecke, into public service. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP primary winner is virtually guaranteed victory in the November general 
election because the district, which includes parts of Costa Mesa, Irvine, 
Laguna Beach, Newport Beach and Tustin, is so heavily dominated by Republican 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer played down the possibility that she could become the first Republican 
abortion-rights backer to be elected to the Legislature from Orange County in 
22 years, saying she believes she won because she had solid credentials that 
appealed to GOP voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more mainstream Republican candidate has blazed a new trail," Brewer 
said. "Hopefully, it will be easier for other mainstream Republican candidates 
in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer, the apparent beneficiary of a split among the district's most 
conservative voters between Reinecke and Irvine City Councilman Barry J. 
Hammond, leads by 250 votes, with an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 absentee ballots 
still to be tallied, according to her campaign. The absentee results are 
expected to be counted Friday or Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 70th Assembly GOP primary was just one of several tight contests Tuesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * In the race to succeed retiring Orange County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, 
the stage is set in Huntington Beach for what promises to be an especially 
intense runoff election. The city's mayor, Linda Moulton Patterson, will be 
pitted against Councilman Jim Silva. 
</P>
<P>
 In a race in which the top three candidates were separated by less than three 
percentage points, businesswoman Haydee V. Tillotson's failure to make the 
runoff will go down as the most expensive personal loss of the local primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Tillotson lent her campaign more than $342,000 -- more than any other Orange 
County political candidate -- only to fall short of the runoff by 1,286 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Longtime Anaheim City Councilman Irv Pickler, behind for a time on election 
night, edged education specialist Linda Kay Rigney in the Democratic primary in 
the 68th Assembly District. Pickler garnered 8,986 votes (53.3%) to Rigney's 
7,728 votes (45.8%). In November, Pickler will face incumbent Republican Curt 
Pringle, who was unopposed in the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the four-way race for county clerk-recorder, Clerk Gary Granville was not 
able gain an outright victory over Recorder Lee A. Branch, despite Branch's 
censure for misconduct earlier this year. Branch's office will be merged with 
the clerk's next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Silva and Moulton Patterson, the two will meet again in the Nov. 8 runoff 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now it comes down to the two of us and that's the way it should be," said 
Granville, who finished with 42% of the vote. "I have to win for the good of 
government." 
</P>
<P>
 * Pending misconduct charges against Municipal Judge Claude E. Whitney did not 
keep him from winning reelection. Municipal Judge Pamela L. Iles also 
successfully parried a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge Gary P. Ryan won the county's only open Superior Court seat, 
while prosecutor Caryl Lee forced Municipal Judge Dan C. Dutcher into a 
November runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in doubt is the outcome of the Democratic primary in the 69th Assembly 
District, where Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce President Mike Metzler was 
leading Santa Ana City Councilman Ted Moreno. 
</P>
<P>
 With both candidates saying that about 500 absentee ballots remained 
outstanding in the district, Metzler led Moreno by 265 votes, 3,338 to 3,075. 
But, he said, "I believe our numbers will increase." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno, however, refused to concede, saying he still believes he will win when 
all the votes are counted. 
</P>
<P>
 If he wins, Metzler said, his campaign against Anaheim manufacturer Jim 
Morrissey, winner of the Republican primary, will not vary much from the one he 
just conducted. Orange County Democrats are seeking to retain their lone 
legislative seat in a district that includes Anaheim, Garden Grove and Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The seat is now held by Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove), who is 
running for state attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 After weighing all conceivable outcomes involving the uncounted absentee 
votes, Brewer's campaign advisers said Wednesday that the "worst-case scenario" 
they could envision is Brewer winning by just 103 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would they make that assumption?" asked pollster Mark Baldassare, who, 
like some others, seemed mildly amused by the Brewer campaign's assertion. "How 
do they figure?" 
</P>
<P>
 Englander said the number is based on the assumption that the late absentee 
ballots will reflect the voting on election day, not the early absentee 
results. The early absentee results actually favored Hammond, who trails Brewer 
by 997 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he is still alive mathematically, Hammond said Wednesday that the race 
is between Brewer and Reinecke. 
</P>
<P>
 "She hasn't won yet," Hammond said. "Tom's real close." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the voting, Hammond believes Reinecke has every reason to be 
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "You had 27,400 votes cast for conservatives and 13,000 cast for the 
moderate," Hammond said. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the campaign -- dubbed one of the nastiest in the state -- Brewer 
fended off the "moderate" label given to her because she favors abortion 
rights. Brewer said she prefers to call herself "a mainstream Republican who 
happens to be pro-choice," a way of thinking that was reflected in her 
campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitching herself as the only fiscally conservative, socially moderate 
candidate, Brewer for the most part stayed away from the abortion issue and 
played to her strengths, mainly the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Contributing $240,000 of her own money to her campaign, the first-time 
candidate also gained credibility with conservative voters via her business 
background and her ties to popular Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, 
for whom she was formerly an aide. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue of choice was not a major issue in the election," Baldassare said. 
Conversely, "the issue of fiscal abilities is one that Republican voters pay 
attention to." 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond, on the other hand, was probably damaged by revelations of his past 
financial problems, including personal bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 With only the late absentees outstanding, Brewer has 13,856 votes (34.2%), 
Reinecke 13,606 (33.6%) and Hammond 12,859 (31.8%). 
</P>
<P>
 The winner will face Democrat Jim Toledano in November. Toledano ran unopposed 
in his party's 70th Assembly District primary.

COURT ORDERS O.C. SCHOOL TO TAKE BACK BOY IT OUSTED; EDUCATION: JUDGE SAYS 
OFFICIALS FAILED TO PROVE THAT 6-YEAR-OLD JIMMY PETERS WAS A THREAT TO OTHERS 
IN CLASS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge Wednesday ordered the Ocean View School District to take 
6-year-old Jimmy Peters back into his kindergarten class for the final week of 
the school year, ruling that administrators had not proven the child is 
dangerous to himself or his classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy, who was removed from his class May 25 after the school district filed a 
lawsuit contending his learning disabilities make him uncontrollable, will 
return in time for year-end activities at Circle View Elementary School under 
the ruling issued by U.S. District Judge Matthew Byrne. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling infuriated school officials, but the boy's father was delighted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won," Jim Peters said. "I'm very, very happy, to say the least. It's nice 
because now other . . . children will be helped by decisions like today's. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't over," he added. "We have to keep on fighting, not just for Jimmy, 
but for the other children who have special needs. But it was a big step." 
</P>
<P>
 The case has attracted attention throughout Orange County because it pits the 
rights of students with special needs -- whose parents increasingly are 
demanding that they be taught in mainstream classrooms -- against their peers' 
desire to learn without unreasonable distractions. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials issued a strong statement following the order, saying they 
were concerned that under terms set down by the judge they might have to wait 
until someone is more seriously injured before Jimmy can be transferred. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is unfortunate that it is necessary to seek a court order in a case where 
you clearly have a student who has engaged in behavior where others have been 
injured," said Ron Wenkart, attorney for the Orange County Department of 
Education. "Congress needs to change this law and allow school administrators 
to transfer special-education students where, in the administrator's judgment, 
the safety of others is in jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the school year ends June 16 and the last week is mainly filled with 
parties and farewells, some parents said they will pull their children out of 
school as long as Jimmy is in the classroom, according to district 
Superintendent James R. Tarwater. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter will not be in a classroom with him again," said Pam Walker, who 
has voiced strong concerns about Jimmy being in the classroom. "I won't take 
the risk and put her in harm's way." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker called the judge's ruling "unfair," saying her child's needs have taken 
second place to Jimmy's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm almost speechless I'm so upset," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters said he is not surprised by the parents' reactions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Soon enough, people are going to realize everything is going to be OK. 
Jimmy's going to be OK. I think that for safety reasons, a program has been 
worked out with the school for Jimmy." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials filed suit against Jimmy on May 25, asking a judge remove 
him from the mainstream class because of what they claimed was violent 
behavior. According to state law, a disabled child cannot be removed from a 
class unless the district has permission from the parent or a judge's order. 
Peters refused to give permission. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne's decision followed a closed hearing Tuesday in which attorneys 
representing the school district asked him to grant a preliminary injunction 
requiring Jimmy's transfer into a special-education class. They alleged that 
Jimmy had hit other students, kicked staff members, thrown a desk and drove one 
teacher to take a medical leave due to high stress. 
</P>
<P>
 But Peters denies the allegations against his son, calling them "out-and-out 
lies." He said the teachers and administrators at Circle View are too closely 
scrutinizing his son and have magnified everything he does. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been very painful to hear (district officials) lie about my son and 
exaggerate about his behavior, but then that makes this (decision) extra 
sweet," Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne said the injuries were not serious enough to warrant removing Jimmy from 
a mainstream class, according to attorneys for both sides, who heard his ruling 
in a 45-minute conference call. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are really shocked," Tarwater said. "I don't think the rights of the other 
children were considered. Judge Matthew Byrne was only looking at the extent of 
bodily harm. To what degree do we have to prove physical harm?" 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also ruled that Jimmy will attend mainstream summer school classes 
-- where he will make up the three weeks of work he missed when he was removed 
from Circle View -- instead of special-education classes, as the district had 
requested. 
</P>
<P>
 Wenkart said the judge's decision has prompted officials to consider dropping 
the lawsuit. The district has no immediate plans to appeal Byrne's ruling, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are mainly concerned with Jimmy returning to class," Wenkart said. "We are 
going to take every step we can to ensure the safety of the other children. 
We've got a one-on-one aide for Jimmy and we're not sure what else we can do."

O.C. SCOUT CAMP CHAPLAIN ADMITS ABUSING 50 BOYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 A Garden Grove man, convicted recently of molesting two young boys, has 
admitted having sexual contact with more than 50 Boy Scouts while working as a 
chaplain at summer camps on Santa Catalina Island between 1991 and 1993, 
authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Khamh Van Nguyen, 24, was sentenced last week to five years in prison on 
charges that he molested an 11-year-old and a 12-year-old at Cherry Valley 
Camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Sheriff's Department officials said they hope that other boys will 
contact detectives so additional charges can be filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Detective Doug Blaydes said Nguyen targeted the Boy Scouts because 
the Catalina Island camps, which are attended by Scouts from across the country 
every summer, allowed him discreet contact with the boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "He preferred the isolation of the island," Blaydes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen was a graduate of St. John's Seminary College in Camarillo, but other 
details on his background are sketchy. 
</P>
<P>
 He had worked with the Roman Catholic church and youth programs in Vietnam 
before coming to the United States several years ago, said Ron Schoenmehl, 
assistant executive with the Boy Scouts' San Gabriel Valley Council. Nguyen 
applied to work for the Boy Scouts locally and passed background screening and 
a six-day training program before he was accepted as a camp chaplain. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen also taught for about a week in September at St. John Bosco High School 
in Bellflower, but was suspended when the school discovered that he was being 
investigated on the molestation charges. 
</P>
<P>
 He pleaded no contest to molestation charges involving two youngsters, and was 
sentenced Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Blaydes said Nguyen told him he had been attracted to boys from a young age. 
"He was extremely graphic," Blaydes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two boys who pressed charges, both California residents, are traumatized 
and are in counseling, Blaydes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoenmehl said the organization did not know Nguyen had confessed to abusing 
so many boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know he had contact with a great many people," Schoenmehl said, "but the 
information we had from police was that it was just these two victims." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Walker, a national Boy Scouts spokesman, said the organization gave 
the police a list of more than 500 boys with whom Nguyen had contact. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boy Scouts does the best it can to ensure campers are safe, but Nguyen was 
"very clever and slipped through the cracks. All the background checks we did 
showed he was considered a wonderful man," Schoenmehl said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blaydes said this was one of the worst cases of child molestation he has 
investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the position (Nguyen) had as a teacher and a leader, he did everything 
in the world against his own personal beliefs and violated the boys and 
everything they understood."

BROWN, WILSON ALREADY BACK ON CAMPAIGN TRAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reveling in a national spotlight, California's two newly minted nominees for 
governor Wednesday coursed across the state with rhetoric at full throttle and 
formally opened what promises to be an epic struggle for the state's top 
political job. 
</P>
<P>
 State Treasurer Kathleen Brown and incumbent Gov. Pete Wilson wasted little 
time celebrating their Tuesday primary victories, each instead knuckling down 
for the five long months to come before the November general election. Brown 
received the belated endorsement of second-place Democrat John Garamendi early 
Wednesday -- the third major candidate, state Sen. Tom Hayden, had endorsed her 
Tuesday night -- and set out to hammer Wilson for his handling of the troubled 
California economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this race is going to be about is effectiveness," Brown told reporters 
at a Los Angeles news conference. " . . . Pete Wilson has done too little, too 
late for the people of California." 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic nominee infused her pitch with optimism and said that, in 
contrast, Wilson has engaged in "the politics of despair . . . and 
divisiveness." 
</P>
<P>
 "What we need is a restoration of the politics of hope, opportunity and 
promise," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson opened his general election campaign before a Los Angeles gathering of 
women supporters, to whom he emphasized the themes that will dominate his bid 
for a second four-year term -- cutting crime, curbing illegal immigration, 
creating jobs and scaling back welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 He scoffed at Brown's gilded political lineage -- both her father and brother 
have served as governor -- and said the style that has garnered her nationwide 
attention would not sway California voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not about personalities," said Wilson. "It's about issues and 
performance." 
</P>
<P>
 The air wars that have come to characterize California political races started 
afresh Wednesday. Wilson, as he had four years ago, opened his bid with a pair 
of television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither ad mentions Brown. Each opens with an acknowledgment of the tough 
financial circumstances that have caused great unease throughout the state and 
have sent his job approval ratings plummeting. Wilson, however, laid the blame 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "The national recession and defense cuts have hit California hard," the ads 
begin. "Nobody understands that better than Pete Wilson." 
</P>
<P>
 The Brown campaign, which earlier had vowed not to let any Wilson effort go 
unanswered, said it would begin airing its own ads by Monday at the latest. 
</P>
<P>
 With the dawn of the day after the primary, the national political machinery 
kicked into higher gear on behalf of the candidates. The chairmen of both 
national parties characterized the California race as a high-stakes battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Haley Barbour, the Republican National Committee leader, said that winning in 
California tops the GOP list of desires and that the party plans substantial 
donations to Wilson's cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no more important race to the Republican Party in the country than 
Pete Wilson's election," Barbour said. 
</P>
<P>
 His Democratic counterpart, David Wilhelm, reiterated his pledge of $1 million 
in national party money to aid voter efforts in California. "There's no 
question the stakes are enormous," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The national attention was immediately evident to Brown, who Wednesday morning 
was awarded a $300,000 check from the Democratic Governors Assn. Indiana Gov. 
Evan Bayh, the chairman of the governors' group, said the unprecedented 
donation was merely a first installment. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's election results brought definitive victories to Brown and Wilson, 
even if each had struggled during the primary season. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who went from putative nominee to troubled candidate and back again 
over the spring, handily defeated her Democratic rivals. With 100% of the vote 
counted, Brown had 48.3%, to Insurance Commissioner Garamendi's 33% and 
Hayden's 13.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who fought back an unexpected challenge by 32-year-old Silicon Valley 
computer software whiz Ron Unz, finished with 61.4% to Unz's 34.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Some bad blood remained between the two Republicans on Wednesday. At the 
traditional post-primary Republican unity breakfast, Unz pointedly declined to 
endorse Wilson. Instead, he urged the crowd to vote in November for "those 
Republicans true to the principles of the Republican party." All through the 
primary, Unz contended that Wilson had broken faith with GOP commandments. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, Tuesday's voting set up a classic confrontation between two 
California archetypes. On the Democratic side will be the mediagenic treasurer, 
daughter of former Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown, sister of former Gov. Edmund G. 
(Jerry) Brown Jr. and a relative newcomer to statewide politics despite her 
family tree. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the backslapping, hand-pumping Brown, there is the relatively 
taciturn Wilson, whose lackluster style masks his renown as the craftiest and 
most resilient of California politicians, a man who has served as a mayor, 
state legislator, U.S. senator and governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their differences, both are essentially centrists, and they will 
battle for the next five months over the ideological middle ground, the bloc of 
conservative Democrats, independents and moderate Republicans that 
traditionally determines success in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates' schedules Wednesday made clear their strategic imperatives. 
Wilson began the day speaking to an organization of women supporters called 
"Pro-Wilson 1994," whose incarnation four years ago helped him to defeat 
Democratic nominee Dianne Feinstein. Then he traveled to Orange County, the 
geographic heart of conservative Republicanism. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown started with a unity breakfast in Los Angeles, then traveled to the 
historically conservative San Fernando Valley for a news conference at a Canoga 
Park defense industry plant. Then she flew to San Jose, to the increasingly 
important Silicon Valley, for another talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Each has a heavy schedule of fund raising set for the next several weeks, an 
element of the campaign particularly important to Brown, who has $1 million in 
the bank to Wilson's nearly $3 million. But the donations flowing in Wednesday 
helped allay Democratic concerns that she would be unable to match Wilson on 
television as the race grows more heated. 
</P>
<P>
 The donation from the Democratic governors nearly tripled the largest amount 
given to any candidate in the group's history. In 1993, the organization 
donated $110,000 to the campaign efforts of New Jersey Gov. James Florio, who 
was reelected, and Virginia gubernatorial candidate Mary Sue Terry, who lost 
her bid. 
</P>
<P>
 The money, as one Brown aide put it, amounts to "a week of TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Promises were flowing in from elsewhere. Tom Epstein, the California point man 
for the White House's political affairs operation, said the Clinton 
Administration is planning a multi-pronged effort on Brown's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 It probably will include appearances and fund raising by Hillary Clinton; Vice 
President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper; Cabinet members, and perhaps Clinton 
himself, Epstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson leveled a retaliatory strike at the expected influx of Democratic 
notables. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time the President wishes to come, any time the vice president wishes to 
come, all the Cabinet people they will send out trying to help here -- they 
will probably have Cabinet meetings out here," he said. "I don't think any of 
that does any good." 
</P>
<P>
 Exit polling showed Brown and Wilson have work to do if they are to coalesce 
support behind their campaigns. Brown, in particular, faces difficulties in 
winning over the moderate voters who will probably determine the election, 
according to the Los Angeles Times' surveys of voters leaving the polls 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A clear favorite among liberals, Brown was hobbled by Wilson's strong grasp on 
the issue most important to voters: crime. The Democratic nominee personally 
opposes the death penalty but says she would enforce it as governor -- a stance 
that capital punishment advocate Garamendi sought to exploit in the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 In a finding worrisome to Brown, just 36% of Garamendi and Hayden voters said 
they would vote for her in the fall, while almost as many -- 33% -- said they 
would cross party lines to vote for Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, however, has serious liabilities of his own. His job approval rating 
Tuesday was only 39%, dangerously low for an incumbent, and more than 
two-thirds of Tuesday's voters believe the state is on the wrong track. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Democrats on Wednesday were encouraging Brown to broaden her attacks on 
Wilson beyond the economic arguments she has been making -- particularly in 
light of the exit poll findings that Californians are less concerned about the 
economy now than in past months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly the death penalty and the overall crime issue is a problem," said 
one well-placed Democrat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "She needs to 
get aggressive on immigration, too. You can't let Wilson dominate that field." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's strategists believe that by narrowing his focus to crime, welfare, 
immigration and job creation the governor will bore in on the only issues that 
will matter to voters in the fall. He also has the task, however, of hammering 
home those issues without offending the more moderate elements of the 
electorate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key swing voters in this race are independent and moderate Republican 
voters, especially moderate Republican and independent women who like the idea 
of voting for a woman candidate for governor," said Wilson's spokesman, Dan 
Schnur. "Our task is very similar to the task we faced in 1990, which is to 
show those voters that this particular woman candidate is very different from 
that ideal candidate that they imagine."

40 AGENCIES BRACE FOR JOB OF SECURITY AT WORLD CUP; SOCCER: WORRIES RANGE FROM 
RAMPAGING FANS TO BOMB SCARES. HIGH-TECH COMMAND CENTER WILL DIRECT OPERATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a low-slung warehouse usually reserved for the construction of fanciful 
floats, a vast collection of law enforcement agencies is laying final plans for 
Southern California's most daunting security challenge in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in nine days, hundreds of thousands of soccer fans -- an enthusiastic 
bunch whose passion for the game has been known to get the best of them -- will 
descend on the region and funnel through the Rose Bowl gates. With them will 
come dozens of dignitaries, possibly a few heads of state, the promise of 
millions of dollars for the local economy and a host of vexing questions for 
the region's law enforcement agencies. Among the most pressing: 
</P>
<P>
 * How to respond if hooligans take to the streets, either to celebrate a 
victory or lament a loss. 
</P>
<P>
 * How to empty the 91,000-seat Rose Bowl if there is a serious bomb scare. 
</P>
<P>
 * How to protect the teams and their fans if terrorists strike. 
</P>
<P>
 * How to react if kissed by a Dutch fan or approached by a red-wigged 
Colombian. 
</P>
<P>
 Supplying the answers to these and other security questions is a job that has 
fallen to officials from more than 40 different federal, state and local 
agencies. They started working together more than 18 months ago, when eight 
cities across the United States were selected to host the 1994 World Cup games. 
Since then, they have met across the country, traveled to Europe and Latin 
America, and trained at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Va. Lately they have holed 
up in an inconspicuous, high-tech center near the Rose Bowl outfitted by the 
U.S. Department of Defense. 
</P>
<P>
 There, armed with a bank of television sets and sophisticated communications 
systems, federal agents and State Department analysts will join state 
transportation officials, representatives of the district attorney's office and 
almost all of the region's major police agencies, poised for crime, violence 
and intrigue in any form. 
</P>
<P>
 The security forces have drilled extensively, testing scenarios such as the 
takeover of a public office building, an attack on a foreign dignitary and the 
storming of the soccer field by furious fans. 
</P>
<P>
 As they await opening day, agents and street cops have been getting lessons on 
the subtleties of soccer mania: They've been advised that some Dutch fans like 
to kiss female police officers, that Swedish fans have been known to deck out 
in dresses on game days and that certain other soccer loyalists have a 
disconcerting habit of turning over cars when their teams lose. 
</P>
<P>
 They've even gotten a briefing about a Colombian soccer star whose fans wear 
huge red wigs to show their support for him. The lesson for the cops: Don't 
panic if a mass of red-wigged fans comes running your way. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of intensity, the crowds may be more like a rock concert than a 
Super Bowl," said Pasadena Police Cmdr. Mary L. Schander, whose department is 
the lead agency at the Rose Bowl. "The difference, of course, is that this will 
last a month, not a night." 
</P>
<P>
 After months of drilling and a May 14 practice session, authorities got a 
chance to test their systems for real on Saturday, when more than 91,000 fans 
streamed into the Rose Bowl for a sold-out exhibition game between the United 
States and Mexico. Traffic snarled outside the stadium, but the crowd was 
well-behaved inside. Police, who seemed omnipresent, reported no serious 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 That event had its greatest impact in and around Pasadena. But although 
Pasadena will host the World Cup games, their impact is expected to stretch 
across Southern California as tourists arrive by the thousands and bed down in 
hotels throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of that, the LAPD and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department are 
planning to step up their activities around the games, and both agencies have 
been central planning participants. The Sheriff's Department, for instance, 
sent officials to Europe to study crowd control techniques used by law 
enforcement agencies there, returning with a more acute sense of how frantic 
international soccer crowds can be. 
</P>
<P>
 One lesson among many was that officers on horseback have special advantages 
when it comes to keeping order at a soccer game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the countries we visited used horses," said sheriff's Cmdr. Barry 
King. "It makes it easier for the officers to move the crowd around, and it 
also gives them a visual platform, turns them into an observation post." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Sheriff's Department and the LAPD, officers are getting specialized 
training to prepare them for the games, in briefings as well as videotaped 
advisories. The first half of the LAPD's two-part World Cup training tape has 
been playing at police roll calls around the city for the past month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not know how a major victory, a close win, a questionable call or a 
humiliating defeat will be handled by the soccer fans in Los Angeles," the LAPD 
training video advises officers, as images of riotous soccer fans from around 
the world flash across the screen. "We must be ready for anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, Los Angeles police expect to see a surge in pickpockets 
and prostitutes, two predictable byproducts of any major sporting event -- 
particularly one that is stretched out over a month. To combat those problems, 
the department has activated units that specialize in those crimes. The LAPD 
also has asked reserve officers to volunteer time for the games and expects 
hundreds to answer the call. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the spectrum, its elite counterterrorism force, SWAT, will 
guard dignitaries who stay in the city or arrive at Los Angeles International 
Airport and will be on call in the unlikely event of a terrorist attack of any 
kind. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, law enforcement agents have been quietly working their sources 
across the country. Internal LAPD memos obtained by The Times note that 
officers from the Anti-Terrorist Division, which handles intelligence, have met 
with local consuls general and soccer specialists and have established 
intelligence links to other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The local threat to World Cup '94 remains low, although there are some 
concerns should the United States team upset Colombia. . . ," according to an 
update on the World Cup planning from Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. 
Williams to Mayor Richard Riordan. "Those concerns continue to be limited to 
crowd control at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that warning for the June 22 contest, law enforcement officials say 
they are not anticipating any special trouble that day, only making sure that 
they are braced for crowd reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 As the agencies prepare for the onslaught of World Cup soccer, officers and 
agents say most of the planning has been smooth and has avoided the turf 
battles that characterized the period leading up to the 1984 Summer Olympics. 
The FBI and the LAPD in particular clashed publicly over who would play the 
lead role in that event. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, friction has been held in check partly by establishing clear 
divisions of responsibility: Each police or sheriff's department is the lead 
agency for any criminal act committed within its borders. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI, meanwhile, is primarily charged with protecting certain dignitaries, 
although some of that falls to the U.S. Secret Service, the State Department 
and special units such as SWAT teams at the various local departments. The 
California Highway Patrol has dominion on California freeways and is assisting 
with traffic control at the stadium. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration 
will be on the lookout for major drug crimes. The Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office will monitor events and provide legal guidance if needed. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the participating agencies come together at the Joint Operations 
Command Center on the Rose Bowl grounds. Final construction work on the center 
-- whose furnishings and hardware will be packed up and used for the 1996 
Summer Olympics in Atlanta after the World Cup -- was completed last week, as 
crews installed carpets and activated the enormous bank of television sets that 
will allow center officials to monitor events in every corner of the stadium 
simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 There is one low-tech aspect: Should a situation overwhelm any single police 
force, representatives at the command post would only need to yell across the 
room. A network of mutual aid agreements spells out procedures for coming to 
each other's aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recognize that a situation such as this one requires us to be talking to 
each other and sharing information," Schander said. "This is not a time for us 
to take little bits of information and hold onto them." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the division of labor and the mutual aid agreements, there have been a 
few flare-ups. The LAPD, among others, has feuded with World Cup sponsors about 
reimbursement for law enforcement expenses -- Pasadena is getting between $3.6 
million and $4.6 million, but Los Angeles, since it is not a host of the games, 
will receive just $800,000 for costs incurred in protecting Soccerfest, a 
weeklong exhibit that is slated for the Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 More significantly, talk of a job action by Los Angeles police officers has 
stirred some tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Angered by stalled contract negotiations, some Los Angeles officers have 
threatened to disrupt security for the games by picketing, calling in sick and 
refusing to work overtime. Those threats bother some World Cup officials, who 
worry that an acrimonious labor dispute launched as the games get under way 
could undermine some aspects of their planning. At the same time, other 
authorities have quietly fumed that LAPD officers are only peripheral players 
in the event anyway and are exaggerating their importance in order to exact 
contract concessions from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD, which has devoted seven members of its tactical planning unit to 
full-time World Cup preparation, guarantees that public safety will not be 
jeopardized even if some officers call in sick or refuse to work voluntary 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have sufficient numbers of officers," said Lt. Ed Wilson, one of the 
department's lead planners for the games. "That you can be sure of." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, a little public relations never hurt either. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are trying to stop trouble before it starts -- partly through an 
unusual video campaign intended to brief fans on what to expect from American 
cops. 
</P>
<P>
 As tourists stream to Los Angeles from around the nation and world, they'll 
see the 15-minute tape, entitled "A Safe World Cup Experience," produced by 
World Cup soccer officials and members of the National Law Enforcement 
Executive Council to be shown on airlines. Once they check in at their hotels, 
they may see it again, as hotels are being asked to play it on their in-house 
video systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The tape, a blend of cheerful narration and stern admonitions, follows a 
couple as they arrive in Los Angeles, where they are greeted by courteous 
Immigration and Naturalization agents and then have their luggage politely 
rifled by a customs official. As they make their way through the city, the 
narrator gives driving tips -- including hints for avoiding carjackers -- and 
warns visitors about American laws such as the legal drinking age and the 
restrictions on open alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
 As the couple, decked out in World Cup soccer sweat shirts, traipse into the 
stadium, viewers get a warning about how American authorities will treat such 
behavior as fighting in the stands, throwing debris at players or referees or 
running onto the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "At no time are spectators allowed on the playing field or pitch," the 
narrator states at one point, adding that "swift and certain consequences" will 
befall anyone who ignores that advice. 
</P>
<P>
 On the tape, a few hapless fans try to bring umbrellas, soccer balls or flags 
on poles into the stadium. Police officers seize them. 
</P>
<P>
 The narrator, meanwhile, tips visitors to points of local interest: For 
example, unlike many of their European counterparts, most American law 
enforcement authorities carry weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Another difference: Although authorities in some parts of the world tend to 
give fans room to blow off steam, the style of American law enforcement is to 
intervene early and prevent violence from gaining momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 Police here want fans to be aware of that so that they will not test the 
resolve of American authorities or overreact if the police move in to break up 
a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are planning on becoming disruptive, violating any laws, we will take 
action," one officer says near the end of the tape, a shot of the Rose Bowl 
looming over his head. "And by the way, good luck to your favorite team."

DEFEAT OF QUAKE RELIEF BONDS ADDS TO BUDGET CRISIS; ELECTION: WILSON DELAYS 
HIGHWAY AND RAIL PROJECTS TO PAY FOR STRENGTHENING BRIDGES. HE RULES OUT A TAX 
INCREASE BUT ACKNOWLEDGES URGENT NEED TO FIND MORE FUNDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The resounding defeat of an earthquake recovery bond sent a financial shock 
through state government Wednesday, exacerbating a grim budget crisis and 
forcing Gov. Pete Wilson to delay highway and rail projects to pay for the 
seismic strengthening of bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who had been so confident of the measure's passage that he had 
prepared no contingency plan for its failure, immediately ruled out a tax 
increase but acknowledged that the election night loss now presents beleaguered 
state leaders with two urgent problems. 
</P>
<P>
 They must find an additional $200 million to finance the state share of 
earthquake recovery costs. In the longer term, they must find a way to help pay 
highway retrofitting bills. 
</P>
<P>
 He maintained that the retrofitting will continue and be financed by 
postponing other projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to assure the people of Los Angeles that the pace of highway repairs 
will not be delayed by the defeat of (the earthquake bond)," Wilson said. 
"Other transportation and rail projects are just going to have to be pushed 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 As he met with supporters to celebrate his own Republican primary victory, 
Wilson conceded that he had miscalculated voter reaction to bond issues, all of 
which were defeated. "I thought that even though there would be a general and 
probably very strong voter antipathy to bonds . . . the (earthquake measure) 
would probably be the one survivor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $2-billion proposal, engineered by Wilson to counter Democratic plans for 
a temporary tax increase in the aftermath of the Northridge quake, would have 
paid the state's share of earthquake recovery costs and provided $950 million 
for retrofitting highway bridges considered vulnerable to damage in a strong 
temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure was overwhelmingly rejected by voters (55% to 45%), who for the 
first time in California history defeated every spending proposal on the ballot 
as they sent government a clear message that they were in no mood to sanction 
increases in the state's considerable indebtedness. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters had been presented with proposals for nearly $6 billion in bond issues, 
the largest amount of indebtedness ever sought in a single election. They 
responded by defeating not only the earthquake measure, but also a $2-billion 
proposal to buy parkland, a $900-million bond issue for improvements to college 
campuses and a $1-billion proposal for public school classroom construction and 
renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 The park bond issue lost by the widest margin, even though it was the only 
proposal that had been promoted by a well-financed campaign. "When you're in a 
tidal wave it really doesn't matter whether you're in an inner tube or a 
yacht," Lynn Sadler, campaign director for the park bonds proposal, said 
bitterly. "The voters just made it very clear they are not interested in more 
bonds." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the defeat of the earthquake bond, however, that confounded state 
government, forcing the governor and lawmakers to begin searching for 
additional cash to provide the state with the money required to match federal 
earthquake recovery aid. 
</P>
<P>
 But the need for cash comes while state leaders are already facing a 
$5-billion budget shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 In his reaction to the earthquake bond's defeat, Wilson said he will try to 
keep to a minimum the amount of money the state needs to spend. He said he will 
propose dropping some programs encompassed by the bond issue, while financing 
others in a way that will not affect the general fund budget. 
</P>
<P>
 He said, for example, that a $575-million proposal for the state to become a 
lender of last resort for earthquake victims who could not get federal 
assistance would now have to be abandoned. By the rejection of the bond issue, 
he said voters had in effect shown their disapproval of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the defeat of the bonds," Wilson said, "the state simply does not have 
the resources (for this program)." 
</P>
<P>
 The governor said an additional $145 million to finance the state share of 
highway earthquake reconstruction costs will have to come out of fuel tax 
revenues used to finance transportation projects. This also will delay other 
road and rail projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional costs covered by the bond issue, including the retrofitting of 
schools and other public buildings, could be covered by revising priorities for 
existing programs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Democrats on Wednesday were skeptical that Wilson could even find the $200 
million in the general fund budget that he said will be needed to pay the 
state's share of recovery costs. 
</P>
<P>
 And as Wilson tried to take time to savor his own primary election victory, 
Democrats moved quickly to lay the blame for the bond failure at his political 
doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Democrats warned the Republican governor not to look to the 
federal government for more financial relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, Pete Wilson has a problem to deal with. He opted for the bond 
measure approach and rejected the pay-as-you-go approach and now needs to 
resolve the question," said John Emerson, deputy assistant to President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson said there is nothing more the federal government can do to help 
California pay for earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 On the home front, the Democratic reaction was equally biting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ball's in the governor's court," said Assembly Ways and Means Committee 
Chairman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara). "I don't know how to balance this 
budget. I think it's unbalanceable. He's the one who made this choice (the bond 
issue) and he has to live with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Vasconcellos said the state is fast running out of financial options and 
warned that if Wilson is considering more budget cuts, he may encounter strong 
Democratic opposition. "I can't close the universities. I'm not going to starve 
babies, and the schools are underfunded now," Vasconcellos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Budget and Fiscal Review Committee Chairman Alfred E. Alquist (D-Santa 
Clara) predicted that Wilson may eventually find there is no alternative but to 
adopt a proposal advanced by Democrats for a temporary half-cent sales tax 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to tell him that the bond issue wasn't going to work. . . . I think 
he's going to find he is going to have to listen to some common sense rather 
than the right wing of his party," Alquist said. 
</P>
<P>
 The options in the transportation arena are not much more appealing for 
Wilson, either. 
</P>
<P>
 State transportation officials said gasoline tax revenues have already been 
earmarked to pay the $750-million first phase of the highway bridge 
retrofitting program. That part of the program, now under way, involves 
strengthening 1,039 highway bridges throughout the state. So far, retrofitting 
has been completed on 277 bridges and is scheduled to be finished on the 
remaining structures by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the second phase of the program, which is not expected to begin 
until next year, that was to have been financed at least in part by the bond 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of bridges and the actual cost of the second phase will not be 
determined until the end of the month, when transportation officials complete 
the screening of 1,665 additional bridges. Early indications were that as many 
as 1,200 structures may need to be added to the strengthening program. 
</P>
<P>
 Insisting that retrofitting is still the state's No. 1 transportation 
priority, Wilson said Wednesday that funds for the program's second phase would 
have to come from the State Transportation Improvement Plan, a seven-year 
schedule of highway and mass transit projects financed by fuel taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 He said other highway projects would have to be delayed to make the money 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 While officials would not specifically outline what projects will be delayed, 
they said it will probably be those planned for later in the decade.

 Rebel Bosnian Serbs and the government of Bosnia-Herzegovina grudgingly agreed 
Wednesday to a monthlong cease-fire, breathing some life into expiring hopes 
for an end to the most vicious conflict to rack Europe since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Croatian officials and Serbian insurgents also achieved a symbolic 
breakthrough in their standoff over the disputed Krajina region by agreeing to 
launch another effort to mend the ethnic rift dividing this country. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the shifting sands of Balkans diplomacy, few among the mediators and 
militants appeared to be building expectations of a lasting solution to the 
wars that have convulsed the former Yugoslav federation for three years and 
left 200,000 dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The truce agreement for Bosnia was accompanied by warnings from Bosnian Serb 
nationalist leader Radovan Karadzic that many previous pacts had called for a 
halt in fighting but "none of them worked." 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs, who hold 70% of Bosnia, had pressed for an indefinite truce, 
apparently with the aim of cementing their hold on occupied territory while 
partition talks bogged down. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Galbraith, U.S. ambassador to Croatia, called the Bosnian agreement, 
reached in Geneva, "modest." Citing the Bosnian cease-fire and the planned 
resumption of talks between the Croatian government and Serbian insurgents next 
Thursday, Galbraith -- chief U.S. envoy for the Krajina dispute -- said new 
opportunities have presented themselves for easing hostilities in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a modest step, but hopefully one that represents a change in the 
psychology of the conflict," he said of the Bosnian cease-fire, which he 
described as an encouraging influence on the Krajina talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Yasushi Akashi, the usually optimistic U.N. special envoy, conceded that 
the fate of the Bosnian accord would depend on both warring factions displaying 
a rare degree of "good faith." 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic and the head of the Bosnian delegation, Vice President Ejup Ganic, 
had refused to meet face to face, forcing Akashi to shuttle from one to the 
other to wring the cease-fire deal out of the two sides. The Geneva talks were 
delayed for four days while U.N. officials sought to enforce a 6-week-old 
ultimatum for Bosnian Serb withdrawal from the protected enclave of Gorazde. 
The peace process was further hampered by escalating clashes along the more 
than 700 miles of front line traversing Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi had appealed to both the Bosnian government and the Bosnian Serb 
nationalists for a cease-fire that would run for four months -- a duration that 
mediators considered long enough to allow the warring factions to reapportion 
Bosnian territory between them. 
</P>
<P>
 But Muslims and Croats -- who have reconciled and proclaimed a new Bosnian 
federation after a bloody, yearlong falling out -- warned that the Bosnian 
Serbs were probably stalling to stave off fighting during the summer months 
when the poorly armed but more numerous government troops gain some advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Ganic, on a stop in Zagreb en route to Sarajevo, said the government stood 
firm in its insistence on a shorter truce, fearing the Serbs were trying to 
freeze the territorial status quo and push the Bosnian conflict out of the 
forefront of international attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Even President Clinton, who had earlier kept his distance from U.N. and 
European Union attempts to pressure the Bosnian government to accept defeat and 
partition, has now endorsed the allies' strategy for bringing peace to the 
vanquished republic by carving it into ethnic pieces along borders drawn by 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 His speech before the French Parliament on Tuesday signaled a shift in U.S. 
policy, closing a gap between the international powers involved in Balkans 
peacemaking. But his words effectively removed the Bosnian government's last 
cause to count on Western support for a more equitable peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you were a Muslim, you might now conclude that the best option is to stall 
and look for a military solution," one Western diplomat observed, noting that 
U.N. calls for more peacekeeping troops to police the cease-fire are likely to 
fall on deaf ears in an international community already exhausted by the Balkan 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States now expects an agreement on a proposal -- namely a map 
outlining the division of Bosnia -- in four to six weeks, said a senior U.S. 
official traveling to Istanbul, Turkey, with Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher. The goal is a territorial formula that will protect Bosnian 
interests and take natural boundaries into consideration, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he noted, "it won't be a negotiable solution if it looks 
totally unreasonable to the Serbs." 
</P>
<P>
 But that U.S. endeavor to appease the victimized Muslims and simultaneously 
compel the Bosnian Serbs to endorse a fair solution has proved elusive 
throughout the 26-month-old Bosnian conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi has appealed for 5,000 more troops to bolster the 15,000 already 
deployed in Bosnia. But a plea he made in March for 12,000 soldiers produced 
offers of fewer than 5,000, many of whom have yet to arrive. And without the 
foreign peacekeepers needed to patrol cease-fire lines, violations can be 
expected, causing the accord to eventually, if not immediately, unravel. 
</P>
<P>
 In the unlikely event the Muslim-Croatian alliance and the Bosnian Serb rebels 
work out a land split in the month following Friday's start of the cease-fire, 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has promised up to 50,000 troops to 
oversee implementation of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 But in view of the reluctance displayed by troop-contributing nations to 
continue exposing soldiers in the risky Balkans mission, mediators fear NATO 
likewise would be slow in deploying. 
</P>

CLINTON TRIP ENDS WITH OXFORD HONORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ending an eight-day journey of wartime remembrance on something of an off 
note, President Clinton returned Wednesday to Oxford University, the scene of 
his efforts 25 years ago to avoid military service in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who received an honorary doctor of civil law degree in an elaborate, 
formal ceremony conducted largely in Latin, said his first obligation on this 
visit was to pay homage to those who conquered tyranny. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no greater tribute to give to those who have gone before than to 
build for those who follow," he said, speaking in the 300-year-old Sheldonian 
Theatre on the Oxford campus. "Surely, that is the timeless mission of freedom 
and civilization itself." 
</P>
<P>
 The President -- who with his wife, Hillary, also met in private with Rhodes 
Scholars and conducted a nostalgic visit to Blackwell Bookstore, where he had 
shopped as a student -- was dogged by demonstrators for at least part of his 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Students protested various causes -- cuts in their benefits, abortion and the 
President's attendance last week at a state dinner in Rome with leaders of a 
party with ties to Italy's fascist past. 
</P>
<P>
 Their presence offered a pointed reminder of the President's controversial 
past at this famed institution, which Clinton left in 1970 without completing 
its degree requirements because he was in a hurry to attend Yale Law School and 
launch his political career. 
</P>
<P>
 It was from Oxford that Clinton wrote the now-famous letter to the ROTC 
commander back in Arkansas to thank him for "saving me from the draft." He 
participated in anti-war protests here and in London. And it was here, Clinton 
has acknowledged, that he experimented with marijuana, although he said he did 
not inhale. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's Oxford event and its echoes of Clinton's ambiguous personal 
history came at the end of a European journey marked by emotional, politically 
effective D-day commemorative events. It followed a speech to the French 
National Assembly, where some members dozed. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's trip has produced mixed coverage, both in Europe and the United 
States, with the President receiving high marks for his soaring, sentimental 
rhetoric at Normandy and other World War II sites and largely indifferent 
reviews for his presentation of American foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 A cartoon on the front page of Wednesday's Le Monde, France's most influential 
newspaper, shows Clinton standing by an old peace symbol lying on the ground of 
a military cemetery. An aged D-day veteran asks him, "Oh, did that fall out of 
your pocket?" Clinton, sweating bullets, replies, "No, no! It's not mine!" 
</P>
<P>
 New poll results indicate that, while Clinton may get a temporary boost from 
the successful image-burnishing of the trip, it will have little effect on 
Americans' overall rating of his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 In a USA Today/CNN poll released Wednesday, Clinton's job approval rating 
dipped below 50% and his negative ratings jumped from 42% to 47% in just the 
past two weeks. There was a two-point upward blip on his handling of foreign 
affairs -- but only to 39% -- while the share of Americans who approve of his 
performance on the economy fell to 47% from 50% in late May. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton conducted largely ceremonial meetings with French, British and Italian 
leaders and with Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
 The people of Rome and Paris also were not overwhelmed by the First Couple. 
Officials of the U.S. Embassy in Rome had to round up stray Americans to fill a 
square when Clinton gave an address. 
</P>
<P>
 And while Paris welcomed the Clintons -- and they seemed to relish a 
post-midnight romantic stroll Wednesday along the Pont des Arts, a few stolen 
moments together on a wooden footbridge with a view of the Eiffel Tower and 
Notre Dame Cathedral -- there was none of the hysteria that marked a visit 
three decades ago by President John F. Kennedy and his wife, Jacqueline. 
</P>
<P>
 Some commentators, noting the current President's fascination with J.F.K. and 
his frequent attempts to embrace his predecessor's legacy, had suggested that 
France might find greater warmth for another young, vigorous, visiting 
President. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton impressed many with his tributes to the survivors and the fallen 
of the Italian campaign and the D-day landings. He and his speech writers 
produced several memorable phrases, including a description of the airmen who 
flew from Britain as "knights borne on wings." 
</P>
<P>
 He moved many to tears at the cemetery above Omaha Beach when he addressed the 
veterans of D-day and the rows of graves of those who died there saying, "We 
are the children of your sacrifice." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also spent many hours with current members of the American military, 
crossing the English Channel on the eve of the D-day anniversary aboard the 
aircraft carrier George Washington. His reception was much more favorable than 
his first visit to a carrier shortly after becoming President, when many of the 
young sailors openly expressed disrespect for him. 
</P>
<P>
 White House aides were heartened by Clinton's improved bonding with the 
military. "He was very warmed by that experience and sobered by the thought 
that he might have to send some of them to their death," said communications 
director Mark Gearan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of the trip was to honor the veterans," Gearan said. "If this 
trip succeeded at anything, if the American people learned more about World War 
II and D-day and the valor of the men, then the mission has pretty much been 
accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's Oxford appearance was controversial at the White House, with most 
senior aides urging him not to go there because it was certain to generate news 
stories reminding Americans of a period in his life that has become a political 
sore spot for the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to cover his own draft record, Clinton said in a radio interview before 
leaving Washington last week that former President Ronald Reagan "didn't have 
conventional military service in World War II." Reagan spent his Army years in 
Hollywood, making training and propaganda films. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also justified his anti-war activities by saying the nation's "desire 
to uphold our end of the Cold War led us into a degree of involvement there 
which was in error." 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, Clinton and his staff were pleased with the trip and the images 
they recorded of the President in his ceremonial role as commander in chief and 
spokesman for the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as Clinton said at Oxford, "our obligations go beyond memory." Difficult 
problems await him at home in the next few weeks: debate over welfare reform, 
hard bargaining on health care, a legal response to Paula Corbin Jones' sexual 
harassment complaint and likely congressional hearings on the Whitewater 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, however, Clinton and his wife were feeling reflective after having 
conducted a national history lesson and enjoyed a moment of personal nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were so many words and yet they couldn't convey the magnitude of what 
we're commemorating," Mrs. Clinton said Tuesday of the previous day's Normandy 
observances.

DOUBTS ON FEINSTEIN'S SUPPORT REWRITE ODDS; POLITICS: ONCE LISTED AS SURE BET, 
SHE FACES A TOUGH RACE. DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S HOLD ON SENATE COULD BE THREATENED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just a few weeks after Republican Michael Huffington emerged as a major 
challenger to her, U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein got more bad news in the results 
of Tuesday's primary, which showed that her support among Democrats was 
unusually soft. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, her prospects for reelection were being reassessed by political 
strategists in Washington and California who had, until recently, considered 
Feinstein one of the nation's surest bets for reelection to the Senate in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, with Feinstein facing an unexpectedly tough race that could threaten 
the Democrats' hold on the Senate and send an ominous sign to the Clinton White 
House, the fall campaign will probably be the most expensive U.S. Senate race 
in history. 
</P>
<P>
 "These infamous lists that people carry around Washington have had Dianne 
Feinstein in the safe seats category -- she's not anymore," said Bob Beckel, a 
Democratic analyst in Washington. "This is one seat we cannot afford to lose. . 
. . If Feinstein goes down, all bets are off for Democrats holding on to the 
Senate." 
</P>
<P>
 In Tuesday's primary, more than a quarter of the Democratic voters cast 
ballots against Feinstein, a higher defection rate than is common for statewide 
incumbents. The disaffection was also reflected in a Times exit poll of primary 
voters that found Republicans more loyal to political newcomer Huffington, a 
freshman congressman from Santa Barbara, than Democrats were to the veteran 
Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein reacted quickly Wednesday by challenging Huffington to three 
debates. The 60-year-old senator said she would relish an opportunity to 
compare her record of accomplishment in Washington with Huffington's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the race will shape up like this: my record versus his record," she 
said in Washington, where she watched election returns Tuesday night. "We both 
came to the Congress at the same time. Who has produced for the state and who 
hasn't? . . . If you compare records, I have produced much more for California 
than Michael Huffington has." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, who kicked off a three-day bus trip through the Central Valley on 
Wednesday, said he would be delighted to debate Feinstein when details can be 
worked out. He also said Feinstein is under an illusion about her image, 
contending that the comparison would be "my record versus her record as a 
tax-and-spend liberal." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's campaign team downplayed the primary results Wednesday. For one 
thing, they said, Huffington has had the political stage pretty much to himself 
so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "This election was after a barrage of $5 million of negative ads," Feinstein 
said. "That is their tactic . . . to destroy. This is a guy who was an empty 
suit as far as legislative accomplishment was concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein has spent most of the spring in Washington and broadcast her first 
television commercial last week. In contrast, Huffington, 46, a former 
executive in his family's Texas petroleum company, spent several million 
dollars from his personal fortune for weeks of television commercials that 
attacked Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may be some sense that she is a little more vulnerable than insiders or 
I would have thought, but she's been on the receiving end of millions of 
dollars of negative advertising," said Darry Sragow, campaign manager for 
Democratic gubernatorial candidate John Garamendi. "I think it's important to 
not read too much into this. The only way to determine whether there is some 
exploitable softness would be to do some opinion research." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein adviser Bill Carrick also said the primary was not an accurate 
reflection of the electorate because the turnout was at an all-time low and, as 
a result, there was a disproportionate number of older voters who are usually 
less supportive of women candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditionally, Dianne, in all of her races, has had more difficulty with 
older men and women than any other block," Carrick said. "This was basically an 
older, more conservative Democratic vote . . . and it was a little rougher on 
women." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Times Poll Director John Brennan said the newspaper's exit survey 
Tuesday supported that contention. About 51% of the Democratic voters were 50 
or older and they were less supportive of Feinstein than younger voters. But 
Brennan said age was only part of the reason for Feinstein's soft showing 
because her support among younger voters, although better, was still not 
impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey also found that about 66% of the Democratic voters said they will 
back Feinstein in November, but Huffington did better in his party with 72% of 
the Republican voters planning to support him. At the same time, Feinstein lost 
17% of the Democratic voters to Huffington while only 10% of the Republican 
voters would cross over. 
</P>
<P>
 For Democratic observers, especially in Washington, there was also reason to 
be surprised that Feinstein would be in such a close race so soon. They had 
seen plenty of reasons Feinstein should be a formidable reelection candidate -- 
she struck a moderate political profile that seemed to be in sync with 
California's 1994 voters, she was a tested campaigner who had won big in 1992 
and she had a productive record of accomplishments since her arrival in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's assets led insiders to feel that her only weaknesses might be the 
state's anti-incumbent mood and unhappiness with the Democratic leadership in 
Washington. That possibility triggered alarms in the White House, where 
officials said recently that the President's 1996 reelection hinges on 
California and the defeat of Feinstein would be an ominous signal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason she would lose is this anti-incumbent, anti-Washington tide 
going around that faces even the best politicians," Beckel said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the exit poll, Feinstein's connection to President Clinton seemed to be a 
wash among voters. Almost as many said they liked her because of Clinton's 
support as said they were driven to Huffington by Feinstein's White House 
connection. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington also benefited from voters who thought Feinstein was a big spender 
and who liked his profile as a businessman. Feinstein scored well with voters 
who liked her key role in passing an assault weapons ban in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's supporters still sounded confident that she will win the election 
in November after voters get to know Huffington. They have sought to describe 
Huffington as a wealthy Texan who recently moved to California. 
</P>
<P>
 They are also likely to point to the fact that Republicans in Huffington's 
home county of Santa Barbara rejected him in Tuesday's primary. Huffington had 
sparked controversy at home by entering the Senate race only months after 
winning a House seat in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, on the other hand, has tried to exploit Feinstein's connection to 
Clinton with television commercials through the spring that criticized her 
support for the President's 1993 economic package. The ads blamed California's 
economic problems on the package's higher taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Republican unity breakfast in Los Angeles on Wednesday morning, 
Huffington underscored his theme that the two candidates represent a contrast 
between a big spender with a long service in government versus a businessman 
and economic conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. Feinstein and I are about as different as you can find two people," he 
said. "Mrs. Feinstein believes in the power of the federal government. 
Therefore, she would like to raise taxes and raise federal spending. I don't. I 
believe in the power of the individual." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's television commercials took about three months to shrink 
Feinstein's huge lead to a competitive level. In a series of statewide polls 
during the last three weeks, Feinstein was ahead of Huffington by 1 to 14 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the candidates are estimated to have spent at least $12 million, about 
halfway to a new U.S. record for a Senate race. In such a contest, political 
experts believe, money may become the decisive factor in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we learned again in this primary is a very simple rule in this business 
-- that candidates and supporters and consultants sometimes tend to overlook 
more than we should," Sragow said. "The basic rule is that whoever has the most 
money wins, and there are very few exceptions to that."

COLUMN ONE; IT'S RISKY BUSINESS IN RUSSIA; VIRTUALLY UNREGULATED, WILD 
RAGS-TO-RUBLES SCHEMES ARE FLOURISHING. MANY NAIVE INVESTORS ARE PAYING THE 
PRICE -- WITH THEIR LIFE SAVINGS.

<P>
 Hey, friend, looking for a good hedge against inflation? How about 30,000% 
interest -- you heard right, 30,000% -- in five years on the rubles you invest 
today? 
</P>
<P>
 Or wait, you've got dollars, you say? We can give 120% a year! Guaranteed. 
Insured. You bet. 
</P>
<P>
 Or how about this: You buy a car from us at a slightly inflated price, and in 
a year we'll give you back the entire ruble sum you paid. How's that? 
</P>
<P>
 Sound good? Such a deal sounded good to Valentina Belova too. 
</P>
<P>
 The retired laboratory aide took the money she and her husband, a plumber, had 
saved over the years by working overtime and invested it last January in the 
solid-sounding Independent Oil Concern for three months at a promised 223% 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 She never got the interest. 
</P>
<P>
 She also never got her money back, and probably never will because the firm's 
director has reportedly disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 What she got was an arrest record and a fine for blocking Moscow's central 
thoroughfare, Tverskaya Street, in a protest with hundreds of similar dupes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The investment came to nothing," she said with a sigh while standing amid a 
crowd of bilked comrades who meet every Monday evening across from the mayor's 
office to discuss their plight. "We'll never see our money again." 
</P>
<P>
 "Where's the KGB when you need them?" asked fellow victim Galina Karamysheva, 
who lost her laid-off husband's severance pay even though the couple had 
carefully checked the firm's credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are financial inspectors. Where are they?" she wondered aloud. "Someone 
should be controlling this. We've just been thrown out into a sea of 
lawlessness and abandoned." 
</P>
<P>
 Post-Communist Russia is anarchic in many ways, but among its wild 
institutions, one of the wildest is its fledgling financial' claims that they 
insure their investments, pointing out that when funds fold, the insurer could 
disappear as well or slip through a loophole in the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Shcheglov, the Interior Ministry specialist in economic crimes, has proposed 
another solution. Companies should be required to have far greater starting 
capital than the current minimum of a couple of thousand dollars, and in cash 
or real estate, not just on paper. Then s buying. 
</P>
<P>
 The longest lines in Moscow these days are to purchase shares, deposit money 
or collect dividends at investment funds with catchy, one-word names such as 
Tibet and Chara or at the 30 offices of a giant conglomerate called MMM, which 
claims 5 million shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Demand for MMM shares rose so high that a Soviet-style secondary market 
developed -- people started selling their places in the line to buy shares for 
almost as much as the price of a share itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the new funds are legitimate, authorities say, and -- so far, at least 
-- have been making good on their pledges. But because Russia lacks both an 
equivalent of the Securities and Exchange Commission and a truth-in-advertising 
law, it is hard to tell what is a scam and what is not. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem of proliferating financial companies, among them dishonest ones, 
"is getting out of control," said Bella Zlatkis, head of the Russian Finance 
Ministry's Securities Department. "It's coming down on our heads like an 
avalanche." 
</P>
<P>
 The funds are so new -- most having been founded within the last year -- that 
there are no definite figures on how many exist and how many have collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are clearly scores of them, and officials estimate the number of 
their victims to be in the hundreds of thousands, with losses running to tens 
of millions of dollars at least. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moscow City Council, which has formed a special panel on the problem, 
believes that perhaps 300,000 investors have already lost their money here 
alone -- and that is only the beginning. Eleven criminal investigations are 
reportedly under way, and well over a dozen shady financial firms have folded. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was reaching the point that it was becoming politically explosive, so we 
had to get involved," said Moscow Council Deputy Vladimir Platonov, who is 
working to find ways to get investors back at least some of their money from 
banks, where what assets could be found have been frozen. "Crowds can become 
unpredictable. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Police are equally worried. 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Alexander Shcheglov, a Russian Interior Ministry specialist in economic 
crimes, foresees a growing wave of collapses by fraudulent companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they're working on here is the pyramid principle," he said. "Those that 
offer the highest interest rates will almost certainly end up folding." 
</P>
<P>
 The government, aware that the collapsing funds could prove destabilizing and 
serve as powerful weapons for the opposition, has appeared lately to be trying 
a bit harder to crack down on the bigger firms. Tax inspectors last month 
demanded about $3 million in back taxes from Chara and are accusing MMM of a 
variety of violations. 
</P>
<P>
 But things appear to already be out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 MMM's president has responded to attempts to clamp down with a counterattack 
that caused a brief panic among shareholders: If the government presses too 
hard, he may have to close down his operation, he warned, and he cannot answer 
for the possible reaction by 5 million disappointed investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The teetering financial market is already the source of growing 
anti-government sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the crowd of deceived investors in the Independent Oil Concern were many 
pensioners who complained that the state had robbed them twice -- once when it 
allowed inflation to shoot so high in 1992 that all their life savings became 
worthless, and again by allowing dishonest funds to flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 Retiree Maria Kolbeneva said she had saved 20,000 rubles -- once enough to buy 
three or four cars and now only the price of a couple of pounds of sausage. Her 
savings worthless, she resorted to renting out her apartment. Living at her 
daughter's, she amassed 1 million rubles, which she invested -- and then lost 
-- in the Independent Oil Concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to really hate your own people to allow something like this," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course the government is guilty of this -- it forced us to it by not 
defending us from inflation," said Yelena Menenkova, a single mother. 
</P>
<P>
 She also blamed her own habits: "We were raised this way our whole lives -- if 
TV or the newspapers tell you something, it's true. Of course, we're guilty for 
believing, but we're also not guilty because that's how we were raised." 
</P>
<P>
 Among suggestions on how to stem the spread of phony firms, the loudest and 
most likely to be acted upon soon is the call to regulate advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 On a typical page of ads in the May 28 issue of Moskovsky Komsomolets, 
Moscow's most popular newspaper, the First Financial-Construction Co. offers 
"Up to 1,600% a year in rubles" -- this when a typical bank interest rate is 
about 200%. 
</P>
<P>
 The ALD Trust promises to put your money into Moscow real estate, returning up 
to 60% annual interest on dollars or 500% on rubles -- and swears that 
insurance "reduces your risk to zero." 
</P>
<P>
 In a Moscow all-ads paper called Extra-M, the Mosimportbank offered 30,000% 
interest on five-year ruble deposits. It took the solid Sevodnya newspaper to 
disclose that the ad was largely an arithmetic trick playing on the difference 
between simple and compound interest. The interest actually amounted to less 
than 13% a month, not bad but not much more than inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Television come-ons are just as seductive. Lyonya Golubkov, a fictional 
schlemiel who managed to afford shoes for his wife by investing in MMM, has now 
made so many prime-time appearances that his name is a household word. 
</P>
<P>
 So has "Marina Sergeyevna, the single woman," who uses her MMM profits to 
improve her fading looks -- and, after weeks on TV, attract a boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hard to blame the duped investors for falling for the get-rich-quick 
promises. 
</P>
<P>
 No one ever warned them what happens to innocents in the market. They did not 
grow up with cautionary tales of underwater real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the most unprepared investor in the world," Zlatkis said. "For 70 
years our people did not know any kind of investment except for putting money 
in the (state-owned) savings bank." 
</P>
<P>
 The financial array they now face is almost as diverse as in Western markets, 
including an unfamiliar kaleidoscope of commercial banks -- more than 2,000 of 
which have appeared in the last five years -- as well as stocks, bonds, mutual 
funds, privatization vouchers and more. 
</P>
<P>
 It is all new and growing almost too fast to keep track of, even for the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the point of view of the Russian government, there are far too many 
funds than they can realistically regulate, and there isn't a securities law 
that would allow them to do this," said Tim Frost, an American financier who 
consults for the Russian Finance Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the Kremlin made financial service companies legal before laying down the 
laws regulating them remains a typical mystery of the post-Soviet period. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is clearly too late to reverse course, and neither the government nor 
experts are calling for them to be outlawed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will always be a financial product offered to the market. We cannot ban 
this process," Zlatkis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, officials and consumer advocates are trying to spread the word about 
dubious funds, right up to an official Finance Ministry warning, carried by the 
Itar-Tass news agency, telling investors: "Remember: investing in any 
non-government securities is almost always accompanied by risk." 
</P>
<P>
 The Finance Ministry is working on putting out more and better government 
bonds to soak up demand for inflation-beating securities. And a new Service for 
the Defense of Consumers' Rights in the Financial Sphere runs a hot line for 
investors and advocates new laws requiring greater financial disclosure by 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the funds do not even specify how they make their money, except 
vaguely referring to short-term loans, real estate and import-export deals. One 
top money-collector is actually registered as a grocery store, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 They also questioned many fundsthe money could be used to cover investors' 
losses if the firm goes under, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, said Rostislav Kokorev, head of the consumer rights service, 
Russia's financial market remains one of the wildest in the world. And the next 
scam on the horizon looks even nastier: the wave of pension funds that have 
begun collecting money from elderly people and promising them hefty pensions 
five or 10 years down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "That will be a serious problem in a few years," Kokorev said. "For the 
category of people who are going to retire and who under-eat now in order to 
amass some money for their pension -- when the pension fund disappears, it will 
be a real tragedy."

SOCIAL CONTRACT TEST MAPS EXITS FROM WELFARE ROLLS; SOCIETY: AN IOWA EXPERIMENT 
IN RESPONSIBILITY SETS GOALS FOR FAMILIES. IDEA IS PART OF CLINTON'S REFORM 
PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In one of several cubicles at the state job-service center in this industrial 
city on the Mississippi River, Tracie and Richard Farley tried to keep their 
16-month-old son entertained on a recent afternoon while their welfare 
caseworker helped them map out the next two years of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracie Farley, a high school dropout, was to get a high school equivalency 
degree and go to nursing school while her husband works part time and goes back 
to college. The state would help pay for their schooling and provide financial 
assistance, food stamps and medical coverage during the 24 months it should 
take them to finish. 
</P>
<P>
 The schedule was written down step by step in what is called a "family 
investment agreement," with specific dates stipulated for the attainment of 
each incremental goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you sign this, you are telling the state of Iowa that this is your plan 
to become self-sufficient," caseworker Rhonda Scott told the couple. "It is 
binding." 
</P>
<P>
 Passing a fidgeting Richard Jr. from lap to lap, both of the Farleys signed 
the agreement, as did the caseworker. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives you an outline of what you're going to be doing for the next two 
years," said Tracie Farley, 22, who quit school at 16 and previously worked as 
a beautician. "It's better than just staying on welfare and having more 
children you can't support." 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa's family investment agreements are among a number of devices being tested 
in different parts of the country to reverse what many experts see as one of 
the root causes of welfare and related problems: a breakdown in the implied 
social contract that exists in all organized societies between government and 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The social contract consists of the unstated but real obligations and 
responsibilities that members of any society have to themselves and one another 
-- responsibilities that some experts say have been ignored by welfare 
recipients and government agencies alike. Now, policy-makers are trying to make 
the abstract idea of the social contract more tangible -- and more likely to be 
honored -- by writing it down. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the social contract taken to the personal level," said David Ellwood, 
one of the architects of President Clinton's welfare reform plan and an 
assistant secretary of health and human services. 
</P>
<P>
 In political terms, the move toward having welfare recipients sign contracts 
is a response to the broadly held public sentiment that many aid recipients 
have forgotten their basic responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a reaction to the fear Americans have had over the last couple 
decades that things are falling apart and some people aren't playing by the 
rules of the game," said Theda Skocpol, a professor of sociology at Harvard 
University. "Drawing up and enforcing these contracts is a way to respond to 
that fear." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, proponents of the approach say, the written contract focuses welfare 
recipients' attention on precisely what it is that society expects from them, 
especially at a time when those expectations are changing. This, in turn, may 
increase the likelihood that the expectations will be met. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're asking people to play by the rules, you have to be sure they know 
what rules they should play by," said Avis LaVelle of the the U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Services. "The contract clarifies what the government 
expects from you and what you can expect from the government. It isn't fair to 
change the rules unless you're sure everybody understands them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's blueprint for welfare reform, which is expected to be 
unveiled next week, includes provisions for written agreements with welfare 
recipients to reinforce the idea that the government expects them to support 
themselves and their children. Similar provisions exist in other federal 
welfare reform proposals already introduced in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Clinton plan, within 90 days of applying for Aid to Families With 
Dependent Children, participants would have to sign an "employability plan" 
outlining the steps they would take to become self-sufficient. If applicants 
refuse to sign, their AFDC check would be reduced to only the child's portion, 
which is one-third to one-half of the grant, depending on the state. 
</P>
<P>
 A written agreement is essential, Administration officials believe, because 
welfare is changing dramatically -- from a system that provides checks to 
anyone in need to a system that puts people to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa is the first state to impose contracts on welfare recipients statewide, 
but other states are experimenting with them. In Utah, for instance, 
"self-sufficiency agreements" are an integral part of a welfare reform 
experiment that has been credited with reducing the caseload in the three areas 
of the state where it is being tested. 
</P>
<P>
 "The individualized plan is critical," said Bill Biggs, director of Utah's 
Single Parent Employment Demonstration program. "If you really want to get 
people into the work force, you have to deal with them as individuals. You 
can't take a cookie-cutter approach." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, a call for a "personal responsibility contract" with each welfare 
recipient was a key element of Indiana Gov. Evan Bayh's State of the State 
address this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most Hoosiers understand how someone can get down on their luck and need a 
helping hand," said Bayh, a Democrat. "But they do not understand and will no 
longer tolerate those who accept public assistance without also accepting 
personal responsibility or who accept the benefits of the system without doing 
all they can to get off it." 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana officials are working on an application for waivers from the federal 
government, which would be necessary to introduce the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 While state and federal officials see the contracts as a way to make people 
responsible and push them off the public dole, welfare recipients in Iowa said 
the documents make the government live up to its obligations. 
</P>
<P>
 Valerie Harvey, 22, said she had been asking her welfare caseworkers for a 
year to put her in classes so that she could earn a high school equivalency 
degree. She finally pinned them down, she said, after signing a contract in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just a contract about you. It's a contract for them to help you," 
said Harvey, who has a 2-year-old son. "They can't back out of this because 
they have to sign it the way we do. It ain't just a one-sided thing." 
</P>
<P>
 That is exactly what worries some local welfare administrators and counselors. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Scott, who has been a welfare caseworker in Davenport for four years, 
said the attention he can give each client has diminished greatly since the 
reform was launched. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to have 50 clients, and now I have 120," Scott said. "I sign contracts 
with four or five people a day and each is added to my caseload. The light at 
the end of the tunnel looks like a freight train." 
</P>
<P>
 John Kiley, who runs the job-training programs for the five counties around 
Davenport, says he worries that he will not be able to provide welfare 
recipients with the tools they need to get good jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are not 5,000 job-training opportunities out there," he said, referring 
to the number of people expected to need such positions in his area. "This puts 
tremendous pressure on the system." 
</P>
<P>
 In Iowa, these concerns are particularly troubling because of the huge changes 
that have taken place in the state economy. During the 1980s, the Davenport 
metropolitan area, which has about 300,000 residents, lost 28,000 jobs, many of 
them high-skill factory positions that paid well and offered great benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few years, the economy has begun to generate new jobs again, but 
many of them pay poorly and offer no employee benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 To live up to its side of the bargain, the state will have to be successful at 
creating jobs, Kiley said. 
</P>
<P>
 In both Iowa and Utah, the welfare benefits of those who refuse to participate 
in the contracts are reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who opt out in Iowa receive their full grant for three months, then for 
three months they receive only the children's portion of the grant and for six 
months they receive nothing. People who sign the agreements but then abandon 
them also are subject to reduced benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 One-twelfth of the state's 42,000 welfare recipients have been introduced to 
the program each month since January. So far, 14% have chosen not to 
participate, but no one has yet felt the sting of the sanctions because that 
part of the plan took effect only last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone who signs a contract has to attend school or job training or get a 
job. Staying home and collecting welfare checks is no longer an option. But 
counselors bend over backward to help participants and will amend the 
agreements if unexpected barriers, such as a child care problem or legitimate 
illness, emerge. 
</P>
<P>
 As Scott told the Farleys, participants are required to earn at least a C 
average in their post-secondary schooling and must bring their midterm and 
final grades to their caseworkers. Participants must show up at all meetings 
with caseworkers, attend activities to help them find work, accept child care 
arrangements provided and take the jobs they are offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Some participants resent such hands-on treatment from the government, but most 
said the family investment agreement gave them the push they needed but never 
got in a welfare office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it intimidates me, because I understand the downsides of a Big 
Brother system. But when you're receiving assistance from taxpayers, you should 
put your best foot forward," said Martha McCall, 27, of Davenport. Her family 
investment pact envisions the state supporting her and her daughter until 1996, 
when she expects to earn her bachelor of arts degree in pre-law and education. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting us off our butts," said Marsha White, who dropped out of high 
school in the ninth grade and has an 8-year-old son. "I'm 27 going on 28. I 
need to get something going in my life. This gives me goals, so I won't have to 
depend on a man anymore. I want to depend on myself -- for my son's sake." 
</P>
<P>
 Other welfare recipients, however, disagree with one premise of the new 
contract: that single mothers with children should work to support their 
families and not lean on the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie DeTrent, one of about 50 people at an orientation session in a large 
room at the Davenport job service office, said she still likes the old terms of 
the welfare system, which was originally set up to honor motherhood by offering 
financial support to widows and divorced women with children so they did not 
have to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel our place is to be with our children," said DeTrent, who has two 
children -- ages 3 and 12 -- and has been on welfare since a divorce three 
years ago. "There's too much going on in the world today -- with guns and 
knives in the schools. I can't see myself going to work. Who could I trust to 
take care of my children? 
</P>
<P>
 "But if I chose not to go to work or to school, I'm out -- no benefits. I 
don't think that is fair."

 EXTREMISM: A former Israeli chief rabbi, interpreting Jewish law, commanded 
Jews on Wednesday to assassinate PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat (A4). That's not, 
however, likely to be the way most religious experts see things. . . . "It is 
not at all reflective of Jewish law," said Rabbi Moshe Rothblum of Adat Ari El 
synagogue in North Hollywood. "Unfortunately, there are extremists on all 
sides." 
</P>
<P>
 BOND BUMMER: Pierce Brosnan is the new James Bond, which many people think is 
a perfect fit. But there are plenty of Bond die-hards who don't like it. "He 
reminds me of a Roger Moore type," said Danny Biederman of Calabasas, who even 
named his son, Bond, after 007. "He's not as forceful and serious as Sean 
Connery or Timothy Dalton." 
</P>
<P>
 ONE MORE STOP: Emilee Klein (above), a Notre Dame High graduate, better learn 
what to do after winning golf tournaments. It's likely to happen pretty often. 
Klein, 19, just finished her career at Arizona State with an NCAA Division I 
title, and will now try to make the pros. . . . One way of celebrating Klein 
won't do is chuck the ball into the gallery. "I can't throw," she said (C12).

 NOT FANTASTIC: The NBA Finals began Wednesday night (C1), but one Valley hoop 
expert who isn't too thrilled about the current brand of pro basketball is 
Encino's John Wooden. Wooden, who stressed finesse at UCLA, doesn't approve of 
all the shoving near the post. . . . "The game has become too physical," he 
said, "and it's taken something away from the beauty of it. I've been worried 
for some time." 
</P>
<P>
 SAVING HISTORY: With all the D-day hoopla, the world was reminded this week of 
war heroes and noble causes. But Bruce Herman doesn't need any reminders. His 
Chatsworth office is filled with military memorabilia, including a rare drum 
from the Civil War and Prussian generals' helmets. He started collecting at 10, 
and is still going strong. . . . "Somebody has to be the caretaker of it," 
Herman says (B2). Michael Arkush

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; VOTER TURNOUT RATE IS STATE'S LOWEST EVER; ELECTION: AN 
ORANGE COUNTY REGISTRAR'S OFFICIAL ESTIMATES ONLY 33.3% OF THOSE ELIGIBLE CAST 
BALLOTS. POLITICAL SCIENTISTS SAY IT IS PART OF A DECADE-LONG TREND ACROSS THE 
NATION. 
</P>

 Turned off by nasty campaigning, predictable races and dull propositions, 
California voters visited the polls in smaller numbers this Election Day than 
ever before, election officials said Wednesday, as they decried a dramatically 
small 32.9% unofficial voter turnout rate rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Tuesday's gubernatorial primary, acting Secretary of State Tony 
Miller predicted a historically low 39.8% turnout, and the Field Poll estimated 
that only 38% of the state's 14.2 million registered voters would bother to 
exercise their voting privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's unofficial turnout rate will probably rise to 37% once all 
absentee ballots are counted, Miller said. "Still," he said, "it's pathetic. 
Embarrassing. I can't think of a word strong enough to say how I feel about the 
lack of participation." 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the vote trickled out at a lower rate than at any time in 
the past 40 years, said Bev Warner, a spokeswoman for the registrar of voters 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about a third of the county's 1,153,694 registered voters turned up at 
the polls Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gone back to 1954 and this is the lowest," Warner said. "I personally 
figured we'd get 40%. I didn't expect to be as low as this." 
</P>
<P>
 The unofficial tally was 31.3%, but more than 23,000 absentee ballots remained 
uncounted late Wednesday, said Assistant Registrar Rosalyn Lever. She predicted 
the final count to be about 33.3%. The previous voter low was 38% in June, 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Baldassare, a pollster and professor of social ecology at UC Irvine, said 
the low turnout reflected more despair than apathy on the part of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the campaigns were so negative that people were left with a feeling 
of hopelessness," he said. "That's not a mood that generates voting." 
</P>
<P>
 Baldassare said voters have a sense that things have gotten so out of control 
in California that their vote no longer matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "They think that there's nobody who has a sense of how to get things back on 
track here," he said. "I don't think that anyone running in this election 
generated confidence or hope in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in Southern California voters did very little to help increase the 
early voting rate; only 29.7% of the registered voters in Los Angeles County 
voted, and San Bernardino County recorded the lowest unofficial voting rate in 
the state -- 27%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going along during the day, I saw certain key precincts with 17% turnout," 
said Dan Trumbo, assistant registrar of voters for San Bernardino County. 
"That's really low. Being in this business since 1978, it's very sad to see 
when people don't vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Political scientists on Wednesday looked coolly at the numbers and predicted 
that democracy in California is safe. They said the voting rate, though dismal, 
is part of a decade-long trend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some voters have become occasional voters," said Mark DiCamillo, director of 
the Field Poll. "They've chosen to vote in general elections but not in the 
primary elections as regularly. Part of that has to do with the lack of 
familiarity of the candidates running, especially with an election like 
yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Gans, director of the Washington-based Committee for the Study of the 
American Electorate, points to New York's Democratic primary in 1992 as an 
indicator of how low voter turnout can get -- and how California's turnout, 
though bad, is par for the course on a national level. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Bill Clinton ran in the Democratic primary in New York, there were 7% of 
the electorate that voted," Gans said. "It isn't terrible what you had there 
(in California). Given what the stimuli were -- one-sided races, no coverage 
except for newspapers, fuzzed-up issues and a scurrilous campaign on television 
-- it's not a bad turnout." 
</P>
<P>
 Gans and Bruce Cain, a political scientist at UC Berkeley, both blame 
increasingly low turnout on the inability of grass-roots organizations and 
political parties to interest and mobilize voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst previous Election Day was the June primary in 1986, according to the 
secretary of state's office, when 40.45% of registered voters went to the 
polls. 
</P>
<P>
 On major candidates and major issues, voters hold views very similar to those 
of their less-interested non-voting neighbors, Gans said. Though he does not 
believe that low participation would lead to different election results, Gans 
does fear that it leads to a less healthy political system.

 Vacancies in half a dozen statewide offices in this week's California primary 
resulted in opening up the political vineyards to a new crop of candidates -- 
among them a Latino political pro, a gay bureaucrat, a businesswoman and 
political novice -- all promising spirited races in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners in these so-called "down-ballot" races below the rank of governor 
had faced a number of obstacles in Tuesday's primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Few had name familiarity with voters across the state or abundant money to 
reach them. Many ran in multicandidate primaries and won without a clear 
majority. The two opposing candidates in the November runoff for the 
nonpartisan office of state superintendent of public instruction, for example, 
together received only about one-third of the votes cast in the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the winners shift their attention to the one-on-one battles ahead, and 
many are already outlining the issues and attack strategies they hope will 
carry them into office. The Democratic nominee for state insurance 
commissioner, Sen. Art Torres of Los Angeles, captured 46% of the vote in a 
three-way primary to become the first Latino to win a major party statewide 
race in more than 120 years. 
</P>
<P>
 To get to the general election, Torres had to survive the attacks of his chief 
challenger, Assemblyman Burt Margolin, whose radio ads pummeled Torres for two 
drunk-driving convictions. He said he is braced for more of the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a no-brainer (to raise that issue)," Torres said. "But I'll keep talking 
about the things that I think are important. I'm the only candidate that won't 
take money from the insurance industry. . . . I'm effective, competent, 
qualified . . . and I'm also a Latino." 
</P>
<P>
 On the Republican side, Assemblyman Chuck Quackenbush of Cupertino, who won 
with 38% of the GOP primary vote, promised a fall campaign emphasizing issues 
and leaving it to the media to raise questions about Torres' driving record. 
His nearest Republican rival, insurance agent Wes Bannister, got 21% and former 
state consumer affairs director Jim Conran, 19%. 
</P>
<P>
 For the coming campaign, Quackenbush said he will discuss ways of luring more 
companies into the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our insurance market is the worst in the world right now," Quackenbush said. 
"I want to talk about letting competition and the free enterprise system work 
on bringing prices down." 
</P>
<P>
 In another three-candidate contest, acting Secretary of State Tony Miller 
surprised the pundits by winning the Democratic nomination to assume the post 
in his own right. His victory came at the expense of two seasoned politicians 
-- former Los Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo and Assemblywoman Gwen Moore 
of Los Angeles, who divided the rest of the Democratic vote almost evenly 
between them. 
</P>
<P>
 The result made Miller the first openly gay candidate to win a major party 
nomination for a statewide post in California and perhaps the nation. Although 
his win was hailed by the Washington, D.C.-based Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund, 
Miller downplays the significance of his sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not defining my campaign or my stewardship of this office in terms of my 
orientation," said Miller, who has served in top-level appointed posts in the 
office since 1976. His platform, he said, includes winning support for major 
campaign finance reform and removing the office from party politics by making 
it nonpartisan. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, Miller will be opposed by Assemblyman Bill Jones of Fresno, who 
was unopposed in the GOP primary. Jones, the author of the state's "three 
strikes and you're out" statute that increases prison time for serious criminal 
offenders, wants to take aim at what he contends is rampant voter fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 He contends that the suspected assassin of Mexican presidential candidate 
Donaldo Luis Colosio was registered to vote in California, although a citizen 
of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the biggest upset of the primary came in the Democratic controller's 
race, where Kathleen Connell, a businesswoman and former Los Angeles housing 
official, won easily in her first bid for elected office. Connell collected 
almost half of the vote against Alameda County Supervisor Don Perata and 
Assemblyman Rusty Areias of San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 Connell said she plans to stick to her primary campaign message that "the 
state of California needs to be managed more like a business." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom McClintock, who handily won the Republican nomination over real estate 
developer John Morris, is a former assemblyman from Thousand Oaks who described 
himself on the primary ballot as a taxpayers' advocate. McClintock, a strong 
fiscal conservative, said his goal in running was to reduce the size and cost 
of government, "simply a culmination of everything I have worked for." 
</P>
<P>
 Another surprise winner in Tuesday's election was Sacramento businessman and 
former state Democratic Party chairman Phil Angelides, who defeated veteran 
state Sen. David A. Roberti of Van Nuys in a particularly nasty primary 
campaign. Angelides, in his first statewide election contest, won by more than 
10%. He said the campaign would be about "creating jobs and using the state's 
investment portfolio wisely. I want to take the skills I've shown in he private 
sector to lead the state of California." 
</P>
<P>
 State Board of Equalization member Matthew K. Fong, unopposed in the 
Republican primary, has already begun airing television ads that promise 
increased efficiency in the management of the state's investments. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 12-way race for superintendent of public instruction, voters picked two 
education establishment insiders to vie in November to head the state's 
embattled schools. The top-place finish of Democratic Assemblywoman Delaine 
Eastin of Fremont, chair of the Assembly Education Committee, followed by 
Maureen DiMarco, the governor's education adviser, also ensures the state's 
highest schools post will be filled by a woman for the first time in its nearly 
150-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 The close third-place finish of Pasadena businessman Wilbert Smith, a leader 
in last year's heated ballot battle to provide tax vouchers for private school 
tuitions, served as a reminder that voters expect changes in the schooling of 
California's 5.2 million students, several observers said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The fall campaigns of both DiMarco and Eastin are likely to resonate strongly 
with school reform themes -- and who is the better equipped to carry them out. 
</P>
<P>
 DiMarco, a Democrat in a Republican administration, said that voters can 
choose whether they want "a professional politician or somebody who has spent 
her whole life working with kids," she said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastin, a community college instructor before her 1986 election to the 
Assembly, will emphasize her strong backing by teachers and other education and 
business leaders as well as her accomplishments as a legislator. She also will 
continue to link DiMarco with the policies of Gov. Pete Wilson, who she said 
puts a higher spending priority on prisons than on schools. In the attorney 
general primary, both Republican incumbent Dan Lungren and Democrat challenger 
Tom Umberg had no opposition. But the race between them for one of the most 
powerful jobs in state government -- historically a springboard for the 
governorship -- promises considerable heat before November. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg, a two-term assemblyman from Orange County, has already begun to assail 
Lungren's performance. "Most people in California don't feel safer than they 
did four years ago," he said. "Most people don't think we're on the right track 
in fighting crime. Lungren has been AWOL on issues of crime control." Lungren 
has promised to run on his record. Among the top achievements he cites are 
efforts to overcome the numerous appeals that threatened to block the execution 
of Robert Alton Harris, whose 1992 death in the gas chamber marked the first 
time in a quarter century that California carried out capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a record of achievement I'm proud of and I'll put it up against my 
opponent any time," Lungren said. "This campaign will demonstrate the 
difference between the real thing and a pale imitation." 
</P>
<P>
 The race for lieutenant governor will provide voters with a crisply defined 
choice between Sen. Cathie Wright, a conservative Republican from Simi Valley, 
and Controller Gray Davis, a liberal Democrat who once served as chief of staff 
for Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. Davis captured 90% of the vote against 
token opposition, and Wright defeated Assemblyman Stan Statham of Oak Run by 
almost two to one. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright made it clear she intends to carry out an aggressive, contentious 
campaign targeting Davis' role in Jerry Brown's controversial administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said his campaign "intends to stay on the high road" by avoiding 
personal attacks and will center on the need to bring new jobs to California 
and to keep current employers from leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis is proposing to bolster the job, using it as a platform to create 
public-private partnerships, developing ideas garnered from the public 
university system and helping employers to meet the state's environmental 
standards.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; LATINOS, GAYS SAVOR RESULTS IN LEGISLATIVE RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Buoyed by Tuesday's legislative balloting, Latino politicians are poised to 
add to their numbers in Sacramento, while gays are excited about the prospect 
of electing the Legislature's first openly gay politician. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Inland Empire, the Christian right rallied around the candidacy of 
conservative Republican Assemblyman Ray Haynes, who scored a surprisingly easy 
primary victory in the 36th state Senate District primary. His win sets the 
stage for a high-stakes November general election tussle with a popular 
Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Lockyer, the leader of the Senate's Democratic majority, on Wednesday was 
seeking to head off Republican gains next fall by portraying Haynes and several 
other GOP nominees as out-of-step extremists. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question for the fall is: Do the voters want religious extremists to be 
their elected representatives?" said Lockyer, whose party has controlled the 
Senate for 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Assembly, GOP Leader Jim Brulte said he has high hopes of cutting into 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown's Democratic majority by two or three seats. Such 
gains would still fall short of the number of seats needed to oust Brown; 
Democrats now hold a 47-33 edge over Republicans in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 All 80 seats in the Assembly and half the Senate's 40 seats were contested in 
Tuesday's party primaries. In most races, capturing the party nomination 
virtually assured victory in November. But, depending on how much money 
candidates can raise, spirited battles could be joined in a few Senate and 
perhaps as many as 20 Assembly districts. 
</P>
<P>
 One Democrat Republicans would love to beat is longtime Sen. Ralph C. Dills 
(D-El Segundo), 84, who -- despite running in a district extensively 
reconfigured by reapportionment -- survived a primary challenge from three 
Democrats by a comfortable margin Tuesday. The flamboyant Dills serenaded 
backers with a celebratory series of saxophone solos as returns showed him 
headed for victory. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, Dills will square off against Republican nominee David Barrett 
Cohen, a Redondo Beach lawyer. Cohen, who is half Samoan, and other local GOP 
officials pledged an aggressive race against Dills, saying that he remains a 
new face for many of the voters in a district that extends from Compton to 
Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Sacramento, Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy on Wednesday did not 
list Dills among the most likely Democrats that he will target for defeat in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislative race that galvanized interest within the gay community 
occurred in the Westside's 41st Assembly District, where Sheila James Kuehl, a 
women's rights attorney and former actress in the old "Dobie Gillis" television 
show, scored an impressive win in the Democratic primary for an open seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl had publicly announced that she is a lesbian shortly before entering the 
race, in part, she said, to defuse her sexual orientation as an issue. But as 
her victory became apparent Tuesday night, she said, "I am very aware of how 
many gay and lesbian people in this state have an enormous pride about this 
election. Symbolically, it makes people joyful." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, gay activists savored Kuehl's primary win and suggested that it would 
be an encouraging sign to other politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if Sheila gets elected, it will send a signal to the many closeted 
elected officials in California that the voters are more intelligent than they 
give them credit for," said Roger Coggan, legal services director of the Los 
Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center. 
</P>
<P>
 In another closely watched contest for an open Westside Assembly seat, Wally 
Knox, a Los Angeles community college trustee, defeated six other candidates in 
the 42nd District. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, in the 47th Assembly District, attorney Kevin Murray edged out eight 
other Democrats for his party's nomination. If elected in November, Murray 
would join his father, Assemblyman Willard H. Murray Jr. (D-Paramount), as the 
first father-son duo to serve in the lower chamber at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray attributed his win to his family and community ties. "I got a lot of 
response from people who actually knew me since I was a kid," he said. "In the 
end, we pushed the family thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Ethnic overtones surrounded an Assembly race in northeast Los Angeles, where 
Antonio Villaraigosa beat Bill Mabie for the Democratic nomination for the 45th 
District seat that has been held by Richard Polanco, who won the Democratic 
primary for a state Senate seat. Polanco endorsed Mabie, who is white and had 
been a Polanco aide, while other Latino leaders favored Villaraigosa, a 
community activist. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Latino leaders who normally are allied with Polanco either steered 
clear of taking a stand on the Assembly race or backed Villaraigosa, arguing 
that a Latino should continue to represent the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, Latinos were building on gains made in the 1992 elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino candidates captured Democratic primaries in two Northern California 
Assembly districts previously held by whites. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the 24th Senate District that comprises several San Gabriel Valley 
communities, Assemblywoman Hilda L. Solis (D-El Monte) captured the Democratic 
nomination, putting her in position to become the first Latina in the upper 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of Tuesday's contests, the 12-member Latino caucus could add 
several new members and possibly gain greater influence. Assemblyman Joe Baca 
(D-San Bernardino) said that with more members, the caucus "can have a stronger 
voice," especially on such issues as immigration policy. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of Tuesday's surprises, Marilyn Brewer, a moderate who favors abortion 
rights, clung to a small lead in the Republican primary for an open seat in the 
70th Assembly District. The district has favored more conservative candidates 
in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer declared victory, but her closest foe, Thomas Reinecke, refused to 
concede because not all absentee ballots have been counted. He is the son of 
former GOP Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Inland Empire Senate race expected to draw major attention from both 
parties, Haynes will square off against Kay Ceniceros, a longtime county 
supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside County Sheriff Cois Byrd, who lost to Haynes on Tuesday, blamed 
lower voter turnout for his defeat. "The general electorate is disgusted (and 
doesn't vote), and they don't have the fire in their belly as the religious 
right does. That hurt me," Byrd said.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; IN THE END, ROBERTI LOST BY WINNING; TREASURER'S RACE: 
STATE SENATOR SAYS HE DOES NOT REGRET DEPLETING HIS RESOURCES TO FIGHT A RECALL 
EFFORT BY THE GUN LOBBY. AFTER 28 YEARS, HE PLANS TO LEAVE POLITICS AND 
PRACTICE LAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the end, the most devastating defeat of state Sen. David A. Roberti's long 
political career may be chalked up to a battle he won -- surviving the tough 
recall organized by the gun lobby two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti lost out Tuesday on becoming the Democratic Party's nominee for state 
treasurer, at least in part because he spent himself dry defending his 
California Senate seat from the attempt to oust him. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was not the gun lobby that -- in its own parlance -- came in for the 
kill after wounding him. Instead, it was well-funded Sacramento developer and 
fellow Democrat Phil Angelides. 
</P>
<P>
 In capturing 55% of the vote, Angelides became an unwitting beneficiary of the 
gun interests' attempted run at Roberti in retaliation for his assault-weapon 
ban -- a bout that left the senator victorious but broke. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to respond to Angelides' attack ads, Roberti watched as his lead 
crumbled in the week before the election, a period in which his opponent's 
campaign reached a crescendo with a flurry of nearly 12 million mailers. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the gun lobby goes after you, it does have an adverse impact," a pensive 
Roberti said Wednesday. "I would have been in a far better position had there 
not been a recall." 
</P>
<P>
 But Roberti said he has no regrets about draining his $800,000 treasury to 
beat back the recall, even though it meant he could scrape together only $1 
million, compared with Angelides' $3 million, for the treasurer's race. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was too important to win, not just for myself but for the greater good of 
the public," he said, adding that he wanted to send the gun lobby a message 
that it could not bully politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, Roberti swore off any more runs for elected office. He said he is 
contemplating offers from law firms and probably will resume practicing as an 
attorney when term limits force him out of office in December. 
</P>
<P>
 As Roberti pondered his future, his supporters reported a bitter aftertaste 
from Angelides' TV airwave assault that attacked the 28-year legislator for his 
anti-abortion-rights views and for corruption in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Their empathy for Roberti, who served a record 13 years as Senate president 
pro tem, was compounded by the fact that many had expected Angelides, a former 
state Democratic Party chairman, to set the standard for a more gentlemanly 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the campaign run against David Roberti was disgusting," said 
another onetime party leader, Peter Kelly, a Los Angeles lawyer. "I think that 
a former party chair doing that to someone who was such a great Democratic 
leader for all these years is just not right, and it isn't fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Republican leader Ken Maddy of Fresno called Roberti's defeat "perhaps 
the most tragic result" of Tuesday's election. Noting that Angelides, 40, 
worked as a legislative aide before establishing himself as a developer, Maddy 
referred to him as "a former staff guy using a sleaze campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have some great sympathy for David," Maddy said. "It's a terrible way to go 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Angelides' four TV commercials aired in a $1.5-million statewide buy 
that slammed Roberti hard, with one ad portraying the Senate leader as corrupt. 
(Three senators whom Roberti appointed to leadership posts were convicted of 
federal corruption charges. But Roberti was never accused of wrongdoing.) 
</P>
<P>
 The other implied that Roberti -- who as a devout Catholic opposes abortion -- 
condoned the fatal shooting of a Florida doctor outside an abortion clinic. 
Roberti had denounced the killing as "horrific." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was negative hyperbole at its worst. And he used it well," Roberti said. 
"It's going to say something about future campaigns where you don't have any 
sifting for the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti, who at 55 is a Sacramento legend after decades of representing 
Hollywood, East Los Angeles and, most recently, the San Fernando Valley, stands 
in sharp contrast to political newcomer Angelides. 
</P>
<P>
 While Angelides urged voters to choose a fresh face with a strong business 
background, Roberti pointed to a long list of legislative accomplishments -- 
the nation's first statewide day-care program for latchkey children, the 
country's first assault weapon ban, breaks for renters, animal-rights 
legislation and more. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his first election on an anti-Vietnam War platform, Roberti has been 
seen as an advocate for the underdog and responsive to community wishes. A shy 
man who thrived on politics as much as he valued his privacy, Roberti was a 
sentimental favorite of many Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Wednesday afternoon, the two opponents had still not spoken to each 
other to offer congratulations or condolences. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't talked," Roberti said. Asked if he plans to actively support 
Angelides, Roberti said, "I haven't thought about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Angelides on Wednesday dismissed the notion that he profited from Roberti's 
misfortune, noting that he supports gun control and backed the senator in the 
recall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Conventional wisdom was that it was a huge boost (in publicity) for my 
opponent," Angelides said. "But in the treasurer's race, it was a non-issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reason, Roberti's colleagues seemed saddened by the outcome of 
Tuesday's primary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to his room when I heard, and it was very heart-wrenching," said state 
Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), a family friend who got his start in politics 
as a field representative for Roberti in 1971. "I just gave him a good old bear 
hug."

CAPITOL JOURNAL: VOTERS THIRST FOR MORE THAN JUST A BROWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If your first name is Kathleen and your last name is Brown, it's hard to miss 
winning a Democratic primary in California. But gender and genealogy won't be 
enough to get Kathleen Brown elected governor. 
</P>
<P>
 People do love a good story with a happy ending. And here is a guaranteed 
heart warmer: Respected governor's baby daughter grows up to become the state's 
first woman chief executive. In between, the only son -- an amusing fellow and 
prophet, but a bit weird -- also is elected governor. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a touching trilogy about the Brown family dynasty, three governors in 36 
years. But as with any story, this one needs believability before the people 
will accept it. People need to believe Kathleen Brown is up to the job of 
governor. They need confidence in her ability to lead -- to talk straight, to 
forge compromise, to cajole and to make tough decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 They want evidence that she grasps the state's problems and has solutions, 
especially for their main concerns: crime, immigration, the economy and 
education. They want to think she really does have a commitment to "restore the 
California promise," and that this is not just another new campaign slogan, 
replacing "America's Best Treasurer." 
</P>
<P>
 They need to believe her desire for the job goes beyond a commitment to carry 
on the family business and to make her beloved father proud. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Tuesday's primary, women were 55% of the Democratic electorate and they 
backed Brown by a 5-3 ratio over John Garamendi, according to a Times exit 
poll. Also, Brown's family background significantly influenced her voters. But 
only 28% of Garamendi's supporters and just 58% of liberal Tom Hayden's said 
they would back Brown against Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of that is bitterness, and most Democrats ultimately will side with 
Brown. But there is a sense among many, including some who packed into her 
victory celebration Tuesday night, that she is not connecting with voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the charm, intelligence and commitment she exhibits in small 
groups, Brown's speeches and TV comments too often seem uninspiring, 
unconvincing and flat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like to give speeches," she told me recently. 
</P>
<P>
 But at another point she said, "I don't think I'm as bad as you say I am. I 
don't think I'm as good as I might be." 
</P>
<P>
 She suffers, Brown suggested, from high expectations generated by her family 
pedigree. And she got uncommonly agitated, while keeping her smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, was Tom Bradley a great speaker?" she asserted. "Is Pete Wilson a 
great speaker? George Deukmejian? I mean, what is it that you want from me? 
What in God's name do you want from me? Look at the people who have been 
governor. Look at the people who have been senators. Are they great?" 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is, as she also told me, "people are hungry for someone who can 
articulate a vision for California, who can give a sense of direction and 
purpose and comfort." Her first mission as governor, she said, would be to 
provide "a sense of hopefulness again . . . a sense that this place is worth 
fighting for." 
</P>
<P>
 But when Brown stands at a microphone and says she's running for governor 
"because I'm angry," she doesn't sound angry. "It's a controlled anger," she 
said. "I am very disciplined, very deliberate." 
</P>
<P>
 And very frustrated with her critics. Last year, to counter charges she was 
not being specific, Brown developed lengthy plans for immigration, crime, 
education and the economy. They, in turn, were ridiculed as too shallow. "I 
mean, I can't win for trying." 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, she said, "I've never run for public office just to run for 
public office. I've run when I thought I could make a difference and was 
passionate about being involved. I'm running for governor for the same reason. 
. . . I'm worried about California."

 Some people say they hear a whininess in Brown's voice -- a long, drawing out 
of words they find annoying. But what I hear is her father, especially when he 
was trying extra hard to be convincing. As a bass, Pat Brown wasn't considered 
whiny. 
</P>
<P>
 The daughter inherited her speaking pattern. And, in truth, she is at least as 
good an orator as her father, if not as talented as brother Jerry. There's not 
a lot she can do about her octave level. 
</P>
<P>
 What she can do is give Wilson hell. And she intends to. "I'm not taking off 
for a vacation," she said. "This guy is tough. He is determined. And I am 
determined to meet him step by step. He does not deserve to be reelected." 
</P>
<P>
 But to be believable, she also needs to be herself and speak from the heart. 
If she doesn't, this race could become referendums on Pete Wilson versus Jerry 
Brown. And Wilson already has beaten that Brown once.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; WINNERS LOOK TOWARD TILTING HOUSE BALANCE; CONGRESS: 
REPUBLICANS ARE OPTIMISTIC OF MAKING GAINS AGAINST DECADES-OLD DOMINANCE. BUT 
DEMOCRATS SEE POSSIBILITY OF VICTORY AGAINST EMBATTLED CANDIDATES. 
</P>

<P>
 Now that the matchups are set, victorious congressional nominees from both 
parties on Wednesday were looking toward November in hopes of tilting the 
balance of power in the influential California House delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans have reason to be optimistic, given the historical propensity 
for voters to toss out House members of the President's party. Feasting on 
President Clinton's political and personal missteps, members of the GOP have 
already predicted picking up three to five seats in the state delegation -- 
possibly upsetting the Democrats' 30-22 edge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at the Republican and Democratic turnout numbers in some of the 
competitive districts, and they're very appealing," said Rep. Chris Cox 
(R-Newport Beach), the California representative to the National Republican 
Congressional Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 But Democrats are not throwing their hands up in despair. In several 
Republican-leaning districts, they see a chance for victory in the form of 
embattled or non-traditional GOP candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Vic Fazio (D-West Sacramento), chairman of the Democratic Congressional 
Campaign Committee (who breezed to victory in his 3rd District), analyzed the 
political landscape Wednesday and liked what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look pretty good. I'm prepared to say we'll not lose any seats -- and may 
gain some." 
</P>
<P>
 But there's more at stake than just the political makeup of the state 
delegation. Almost one of every eight seats in the House is from California, 
and a poor showing by the Republicans during this opportune midterm election 
could derail the GOP's nationwide effort to erode the decades-old Democratic 
House majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Southern California seats, GOP-friendly on paper, illustrate the 
Republicans' difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhibit A: In the 44th District, encompassing the eastern Riverside County 
towns of Palm Springs, Moreno Valley, Indio and Blythe, Republicans have put up 
former entertainer Sonny Bono. The diminutive, grinning Bono, who gained fame 
as the klutzy, bell-bottomed foil to Cher's earthy brand of sophistication, is 
a former Palm Springs mayor. But the perception of him as a political 
lightweight is expected to become a Democratic campaign anthem. 
</P>
<P>
 An ebullient Bono said Wednesday that he thinks he has finally crossed the 
bridge from wacky cultural icon to bona fide political candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran GOP House member Al McCandless left the seat open with his retirement 
announcement earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bono's victory stands in contrast to two years ago, when he was widely 
regarded as a misplaced political wanna-be and was thrashed in a Republican 
primary for U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I ran the Senate race, nobody was there with me," the 59-year-old Bono 
said. "In that race, my name ID was attached to my last career (as Cher's 
singing and television partner) and not my current one (as a businessman and 
then-mayor of Palm Springs). 
</P>
<P>
 For the faceoff in November, Bono says he will continue to sell himself as a 
political outsider who is better able to represent the district than is 
Democratic winner Steve Clute, whom he colors as a pure politician. Clute spent 
10 years in the state Assembly before stepping aside in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Clute, 45, said his campaign would focus on the very issue that Bono wants to 
attack: his previous political experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the district better than Sonny, and I've already done things to help 
the district. I'm going to make the case that I can best deliver more of the 
kind of support this district needs," Clute said. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhibit B: Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Riverside), seemingly forgiven by voters for 
his dalliance with a prostitute last year, won a close victory in the 43rd 
District. But he faces the same Democratic challenger who nearly beat him in 
1992. Even before his slim victory Tuesday, Calvert was rated the most 
vulnerable incumbent in the country by the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvert now faces Democrat Mark Takano in a rematch of their race two years 
ago, which Calvert won by a scant 519 votes -- the closest congressional 
election in the country that year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Primaries are never fun. I've never enjoyed primaries," Calvert said 
Wednesday from Dallas, en route to Washington. In a post-election statement, 
Calvert conceded: "This primary campaign has been more about personality than 
policy and more about style than substance. All that changes now." 
</P>
<P>
 Calvert beat conservative UC Riverside business professor Joe Khoury by about 
1,000 votes -- and with about 5,000 absentee votes still to be counted. 
</P>
<P>
 Takano, a trustee for the Riverside Community College District and a high 
school English and history teacher, wouldn't indicate Wednesday whether he'll 
hit Calvert on the sex-in-the-car incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll campaign on issues that are relevant to the district," he said. "I'll 
just leave it at that." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the western Riverside County district has a 10,000-voter edge in 
Republican registration, Takano said he expects the Democratic Party will work 
hard to bolster its party registration. 
</P>
<P>
 In other key regional races, Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks 
defeated millionaire businessman Ron Florance in the coastal 36th District to 
meet first-term Rep. Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey), who had no primary 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans believe the seat belongs to them, even though there are slightly 
more registered Democrats than Republicans in the district. Analysts believe 
the race may be close because Republicans tend to have better voter turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Rich Sybert, a former aide to Gov. Pete Wilson, easily won the 
Republican nomination in the 24th District, which includes Malibu, for the 
right to face veteran Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) in the 
general election. 
</P>
<P>
 The well-financed Sybert should give the veteran Beilenson his toughest race 
since his southwest San Fernando Valley district was made less secure by 
redistricting. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican freshman Jay C. Kim of Diamond Bar easily beat back four GOP 
challengers in the 41st District, which includes parts of Orange, Los Angeles 
and San Bernardino counties. Under investigation by several federal agencies 
for possible campaign finance irregularities in his 1992 race, Kim should have 
smooth sailing in November, barring indictments or other legal problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The 22nd District seat, vacated by Rep. Michael Huffington for his successful 
run for the Republican U.S. Senate nomination, will be fought over by Democrat 
Walter Capps, a UC Santa Barbara professor, and San Luis Obisbo Assemblywoman 
Andrea Seastrand. Although it is considered GOP territory, voters have 
demonstrated an independent streak, particularly in sending Democrats to the 
state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 The third open seat should be a Democratic slam-dunk in the fall. California 
delegation dean Don Edwards retired this year, leaving two strong Democrats to 
fight over his 16th District turf, which includes the eastern portion of San 
Jose and southern Santa Clara County. County Supervisor Zoe Lofgren edged out 
former San Jose Mayor Tom McEnery for the nomination.

JUDGES FLOUT LAW ON CLOSED DISCIPLINARY HEARINGS, LUNGREN SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six years after California voters enacted a measure calling for greater public 
access to judicial disciplinary proceedings, "an open hearing has yet to be 
conducted in this state," Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren said this week as he urged 
support for legislation to strip away the veil of secrecy from inquiries into 
judges' conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 In letters to legislators, Lungren said the system has thwarted the will of 
voters who in 1988 enacted Proposition 92, which called for open judicial 
disciplinary hearings if the charges involved "moral turpitude, dishonesty or 
corruption." 
</P>
<P>
 Judges charged with such acts by the Commission on Judicial Performance have 
avoided public hearings after they "sought and received some form of secret 
writ relief from other courts of record in this state," Lungren said in his 
June 7 letter. "This complete frustration" of constitutional provisions 
concerning open hearings raises "troubling questions regarding the functioning 
of California's judicial disciplinary procedures." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the secret hearings also raise "a disturbing appearance of 
impropriety: the specter of judges throughout this state" using their power in 
sealed proceedings to protect their judicial colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Without naming names, Lungren detailed four cases. In one instance, a closed 
hearing was ordered by judges who ruled that an accused judge's reelection 
prospects and reputation would suffer serious harm if the public discovered 
before an election that the judge had been accused of conduct, involving moral 
turpitude, dishonesty or corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 "Inherent in these rulings was the conclusion that the accused judge's 
political interests outweighed any interest the voters might have before they 
cast their ballots in learning the truth: that this judge had been charged with 
serious misconduct," Lungren wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 A system of completely open formal proceedings is not only valuable for 
reasons of good government, but also will better protect complaining witnesses 
from judicial retaliation in these cases and ensure full and accurate 
fact-finding, Lungren wrote. "The present system of confidentiality in formal 
proceedings is clearly unworkable and is impairing the ability of the system to 
accomplish its goals." 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren, who is seeking reelection, wrote in support of measures introduced by 
state Sen. Alfred E. Alquist (D-Jose) and Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
 Both measures would require that disciplinary proceedings conducted by the 
Commission on Judicial Performance be held in public once formal charges are 
filed, eliminate the judge majority on the commission by adding more citizen 
members and attempt to curb secret "satellite litigation" about when and 
whether hearings will be open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "The premise of the bills is the same -- to end this elite Star Chamber system 
that no one has any confidence in anymore, except perhaps the judges," said 
Gene Erbin, counsel to the Assembly Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The bills reflect intense frustration with the commission, considered a 
path-breaking agency when it was created in 1961. In recent years, though, the 
commission has been severely criticized for meting out little discipline and 
for conducting the vast amount of its work in secret. 
</P>
<P>
 In its 33-year history, the commission has held a public hearing in only one 
judicial discipline case. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission records state that although the number of complaints against judges 
went from 260 in 1980 to 950 last year, the number of judges disciplined rose 
hardly at all -- from eight to 10. The largest number of judges disciplined by 
the commission in a single year was 18 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission officials generally have taken the position that the lack of 
discipline simply reflects the overall high quality of the state's judges. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission is composed of five judges appointed by the state Supreme 
Court, two lawyers appointed by the State Bar and two members of the public 
appointed by the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Alquist and Brown bills would require amending the California 
Constitution. Hearings on both bills are scheduled for next week in Sacramento. 
Passage would require a two-thirds vote in the Legislature, and then a majority 
vote in a general election. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Judges Assn. and the commission oppose the bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission does not oppose all open hearings but wants to reserve the 
right to close some under certain circumstances, commission general counsel 
Victoria B. Henley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a change is to be undertaken now, the commission would not support having 
all proceedings open from the filing of formal charges, as proposed," Henley 
said in a letter to Alquist. "It has been the commission's experience that 
closed hearings can be appropriate and should be retained in some instances." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Superior Court Judge Steven Z. Perren, who is vice president of 
the judges association, said there is no need for hasty action, though he 
acknowledged that the state's current system "is under fire." He said that 
Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas has appointed a special committee to examine the 
issue of judicial discipline in the state and is scheduled to report in 
September. He also said the American Bar Assn. is preparing a set of model 
rules for judicial disciplinary procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Perren said judges felt the Legislature should not act until the state 
commission and the ABA have issued their reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a tremendous concern among the judges that once damned, they are 
always damned," Perren said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren said he believes that secrecy should be maintained during the 
investigatory phase of disciplinary proceedings. But he said that once 
preliminary investigation has been completed and formal charges are filed, 
secrecy should end: 
</P>
<P>
 "The complete elimination of confidentiality at the stage of formal 
proceedings . . . is long overdue."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; VOTER TURNOUT RATE IS STATE'S LOWEST EVER; PARTICIPATION: 
ONLY 32.9% OF THOSE REGISTERED WENT TO THE POLLS, UNOFFICIAL COUNT SHOWS. 
POLITICAL SCIENTISTS SAY IT IS PART OF A DECADE-LONG TREND ACROSS THE NATION.

 Turned off by nasty campaigning, predictable races and dull propositions, 
California voters visited the polls at a lower rate this Election Day than ever 
before, election officials said Wednesday, as they decried a dramatically small 
32.9% unofficial voter turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Tuesday's gubernatorial primary, acting Secretary of State Tony 
Miller predicted a historically low 39.8% turnout, and the Field Poll estimated 
that only 38% of the state's 14.2 million registered voters would bother to 
exercise their voting privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's unofficial turnout rate will probably rise to 37% once all 
absentee ballots are counted, Miller said. "Still," he said, "it's pathetic. 
Embarrassing. I can't think of a word strong enough to say how I feel about the 
lack of participation." 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California voters did very little to help increase the early voting 
rate; only 29.7% of the registered voters in Los Angeles County voted, and San 
Bernardino County recorded the lowest unofficial voting rate in the state -- 
27%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going along during the day, I saw certain key precincts with 17% turnout," 
said Dan Trumbo, assistant registrar of voters for San Bernardino County. 
"That's really low. Being in this business since 1978, it's very sad to see 
when people don't vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Political scientists on Wednesday looked coolly at the numbers and predicted 
that democracy in California is safe. They said the voting rate, though dismal, 
is part of a decade-long trend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some voters have become occasional voters," said Mark DiCamillo, director of 
the Field Poll. "They've chosen to vote in general elections but not in the 
primary elections as regularly. Part of that has to do with the lack of 
familiarity of the candidates running, especially with an election like 
yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Gans, director of the Washington-based Committee for the Study of the 
American Electorate, points to New York's Democratic primary in 1992 as an 
indicator of how low voter turnout can get -- and how California's turnout, 
though bad, is par for the course on a national level. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Bill Clinton ran in the Democratic primary in New York, there were 7% of 
the electorate that voted," Gans said. "It isn't terrible what you had there 
(in California). Given what the stimuli were -- one-sided races, no coverage 
except for newspapers, fuzzed-up issues and a scurrilous campaign on television 
-- it's not a bad turnout." 
</P>
<P>
 Gans and Bruce Cain, a political scientist at UC Berkeley, both blame 
increasingly low turnout on the inability of grass-roots organizations and 
political parties to interest and mobilize their members to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no major mobilization effort launched by any of the campaigns to 
get people out there," said Cain. "The Democrats very self-consciously chose to 
go after the most frequent voters. . . . Increasingly as a way of saving money, 
people do not mobilize voters unless they need to." 
</P>
<P>
 The worst previous Election Day was the June primary in 1986, according to the 
secretary of state's office, when 40.45% of registered voters went to the 
polls. 
</P>
<P>
 On major candidates and major issues, voters hold views very similar to those 
of their less-interested non-voting neighbors, Gans said. Though he does not 
believe that low participation would lead to different election results, Gans 
does fear that it leads to a less healthy political system. 
</P>
<P>
 County by county, local officials were much less sanguine than those who 
follow elections on a state or national level. "We still have absentees to 
count, but it's not going to take it up a whole lot," said Jenny Harrison, 
deputy county clerk in Ventura County, where turnout was 31.1%. "It's 
incredible, unreal, the lowest in history." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone was alarmed. Tiny Alpine County, in fact, thinks it can teach the 
big boys and girls a thing or two about democracy and the exercise thereof. 
Yes, the latest census counted only 1,113 residents in the wooded county south 
of South Lake Tahoe. But 745 of those are registered, and 570 -- or 76.5%, the 
highest rate in the state -- cast ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 Alpine County Clerk Karen Keebaugh credits the convenience of an all-mail 
ballot and the excitement of two hotly contested races for the heavy turnout. 
But she also points out that her neighbors are no slouches. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the smallest county in population, but we're pretty mighty," Keebaugh 
said. "We take our voting seriously. We're really excited."

PALESTINIANS FORM PANEL TO MONITOR SELF-RULE; MIDEAST: COMMISSION WILL SEEK 
FORMAL STATUS TO PREVENT ABUSE OF POWER BY NEW AUTHORITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Determined that respect for human rights and the rule of law will be embedded 
in their political system as it develops, 14 leading Palestinian intellectuals 
on Wednesday announced the formation of a commission to monitor the new 
Palestinian Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanan Mikhail-Ashrawi, former spokeswoman of the Palestinian delegation to 
peace talks with Israel, said the Palestinian Independent Commission for 
Citizens' Rights wants the status of an ombudsman, with the power to 
investigate and prevent abuses of authority and misuse of public funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission hopes initially to help shape basic legislation, including a 
strong bill of rights, under which the Gaza Strip, the West Bank town of 
Jericho and eventually the rest of the West Bank will be governed, 
Mikhail-Ashrawi said. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said the panel is already investigating a variety of complaints, 
including what appears to be the first political detention by the Palestinian 
police, a possible financial conflict of interest by a member of the 
Palestinian Authority's governing council and the confiscation of property in 
Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Palestinians have been concerned that strong democratic institutions be 
established quickly as the Israeli occupation ends in the Gaza Strip and West 
Bank so that the Palestinian government there does not develop into another 
Arab autocracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing the effort as "an unusual precedent in the Arab world," 
Mikhail-Ashrawi said the commission had encountered suspicion and open 
hostility in some of its initial investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 "People tend to be very defensive," she said. "They don't like anyone looking 
over their shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Mamdouh Aker, a leading West Bank surgeon and prominent human rights 
activist, described the commission's work as "even more of a challenge and a 
necessity as we are emerging into statehood." He said it should not be delayed 
until a Palestinian government has been established. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is already an authority that is exercising its role and using its 
power," he said, "and safeguards should be put in place as that happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides monitoring the Palestinian Authority and its security forces, the 
group plans to help prepare for local and national elections on the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip; review proposed legislation, and undertake an education program 
to acquaint Palestinians with their rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Although formed independently, the commission expects to get legal status from 
the Palestinian legislature once that body is elected. This would give the 
commission the personnel and funding to investigate government officials and 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, it operates under decree of Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine 
Liberation Organization and head of the Palestinian Authority. It has received 
$586,500 in donations and pledges from European governments and the United 
Nations to finance its first year of operations. 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure its independence, members cannot serve in political positions, and 
the authority cannot dissolve it, Mikhail-Ashrawi added. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikhail-Ashrawi, who was a professor of literature at Birzeit University 
before entering politics, turned down an offer from Arafat to join the interim 
Palestinian government in preference to serving as commissioner-general. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Wednesday, the PLO rejected an Israeli plan to release 
an estimated 2,500 Palestinian prisoners on the condition they remain in the 
Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement signed last month by Israel and the PLO, the prisoners 
were to have been released Wednesday. But Palestinian officials demanded that 
all prisoners be allowed to return to their homes.

SOCIAL ISSUES; ANTI-GAY-RIGHTS MEASURES IGNITE AGGRESSIVE BATTLES IN 7 STATES; 
PROPOSED BALLOT INITIATIVES IN WASHINGTON, OREGON, NEVADA, ARIZONA, IDAHO, 
MISSOURI AND MICHIGAN HAVE RALLIED FORCES ON BOTH SIDES.

<P>
 Kelly Walton spent a dozen days driving the length and breadth of Idaho, 
stopping in every tiny town. Missourian Paul Summers is meeting with church 
groups. Doug Burman's helpers in Washington state are talking with their 
friends at work. 
</P>
<P>
 They and the like-minded in four other states are on a quest. Signatures are 
their trophy -- enough to earn a place on their November state ballots for a 
set of referendums that, if enacted, could hobble the gay-rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
 From the Pacific Coast to the Midwest, conservative activists like Walton, 
Summers and Burman are circulating petitions for ballot initiatives that would 
bar the adoption of any laws protecting gay men and lesbians from 
discrimination. Several of the proposed measures also would forbid government 
recognition of gay domestic partnerships, the spending of public funds in a way 
that implies acceptance of homosexuality, or its sympathetic treatment in 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 With a month to go before most of the petitions are due, it remains unclear 
how many of the ballot drives in the seven states -- Washington, Oregon, 
Nevada, Arizona, Idaho, Missouri and Michigan -- will be successful. But they 
are already occupying center stage in the gay movement, where they are seen as 
an ominous trend that will be difficult to defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an unofficial national referendum on homosexuality in America," said 
Robert Bray of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, one of several gay 
groups organizing against the initiatives. "And it's not a coincidence these 
are popping up all over." 
</P>
<P>
 Initiative proponents are moving ahead despite the legal clouds that hang over 
such measures. An anti-gay-rights referendum approved by Colorado voters in 
1992 is bottled up by court challenges. A number of local referendums adopted 
by Oregon towns have been rendered toothless by a state law, which is in turn 
the subject of a lawsuit, while in other states courts have blocked local 
anti-gay-rights ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
 Such challenges notwithstanding, conservative activists say it is important to 
keep the matter before the public. "We want to get the debate out of the 
Establishment and (to) the citizens," said Lon Mabon of the Oregon Citizens 
Alliance, the organization behind a bitterly contested referendum that was 
defeated by voters in 1992. The group has since promoted the local initiatives 
passed in some two dozen Oregon communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more elections we can have, the more votes, the more it's going to tell 
the judges and the politicians and even the editorial boards (that) this is the 
standard we want to have," added Mabon, who is trying to get another anti-gay 
initiative on the Oregon ballot this fall and is also involved in ballot 
efforts in Washington state, Idaho and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 Gay-rights foes describe the initiatives as a response to an aggressive gay 
movement that they say is demanding endorsement of immoral behavior. "They 
insist that society -- with government reinforcement -- recognize their 
lifestyle," said Summers, who is leading the Missouri petition drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The signature-gathering efforts generally have been low key -- partly, backers 
say, because they don't have much money, don't want to be harassed and want to 
keep their opponents guessing. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers in Washington state -- where there are two competing anti-gay 
measures -- Idaho and Oregon seem confident of collecting enough signatures, 
but in other states the outcome is less certain. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arizona initiative hasn't even mustered solid support in the conservative 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a mainstream conservative effort," said Cathi Herrod of the Arizona 
branch of Concerned Women for America, which is not involved with the 
referendum drive. "It's a question of timing and strategy. We just don't 
believe it's the right strategy for Arizona in '94. . . . We would rather focus 
time and energy on (political) races." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, gay-rights attorneys are trying to derail the initiatives 
before they make it to the ballots. The Lambda Legal Defense and Education 
Fund, a national group, has joined legal teams challenging the ballot proposals 
on both technical and constitutional grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Measures which put the fundamental rights of individual citizens to a vote 
are an inappropriate subject for the ballot," said Lambda staff attorney 
Suzanne B. Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal attacks have so far yielded mixed results. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the Florida Supreme Court killed a proposed initiative, snuffing out 
what would have been one of the most volatile anti-gay referendum fights in the 
nation. The court ruled that the measure violated the state constitution by 
addressing more than one subject. Legal challenges in Idaho and Washington 
state have failed, while a lower court's ruling against Mabon's proposed Oregon 
initiative is on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides are drawing from the 1992 referendum battles in Colorado and 
Oregon, refining their messages accordingly as they pursue middle-of-the-road 
voters. Polling, focus groups and political consultants are helping shape 
themes. 
</P>
<P>
 Gay-rights advocates have learned that one of their most powerful arguments is 
that the ballot measures promote discrimination. "Seventy-six percent of the 
American public thinks it's wrong to discriminate (against gays) in hiring and 
firing," said Anne F. Lewis, a political consultant working with the Human 
Rights Campaign Fund, a national gay group. "You're never going to get better 
than 76%." 
</P>
<P>
 Gay-rights advocates are also portraying the referendums as part of a much 
larger conservative effort. "I think these initiatives are wedges by which the 
far right can divide communities and advance a broader agenda," said Bray, who 
has traveled more than 100,000 miles crisscrossing the country to find and 
train budding gay organizers in such unlikely spots as Wyoming and the outback 
of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Bray and others insist that the initiatives have spurred so much 
organizing in unexpected places that the movement will come out ahead, 
regardless of what happens in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Activists are further turning to the Democrats for help. The Gay and Lesbian 
Victory Fund last winter released a letter in which President Clinton expressed 
disapproval of the anti-gay initiatives. And representatives of the Democratic 
National Committee have attended coalition meetings about the referendums. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're tracking these developments largely as they impact turnout in those 
states," said DNC spokesman Jim Whitney. "Clearly anti-gay initiatives are one 
vehicle the radical right uses to . . . get their voters out." 
</P>
<P>
 Gay-rights opponents are sharing ideas as well. Last month, the group that 
spearheaded the 1992 Colorado referendum hosted a closed meeting in Colorado 
Springs in which anti-gay activists from a number of states mulled over 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that they are in universal agreement. In Washington state, for instance, 
there is some resentment of Mabon's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't believe Lon Mabon's presence -- nothing personally against him -- 
would help our effort, and we have a different approach," said Burman, who is 
backing a rival anti-gay measure. 
</P>
<P>
 And although the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon of the Anaheim-based Traditional Values 
Coalition is helping with several of the initiative drives, his group decided 
not to proceed with a ballot effort it was considering for California. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing to the repeal of local gay-rights ordinances in various states, 
Sheldon said: "It's been shown to us by these elections it's more prudent for 
them to make a move and then repeal, than for us to initiate a ballot measure 
against them." The Tug-of-War Over Gay Rights 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-gay ordianances aim to repeal existing laws or block new laws that would 
protect gay people from discrimination. Federal civil rights applies o race, 
creed, color and religion -- not sexuality or gender.

MAJOR EARTHQUAKE IN BOLIVIA IS FELT AS FAR AWAY AS TORONTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A major earthquake rumbled through northern Bolivia on Wednesday and was 
reportedly felt as far away as Los Angeles and Toronto, the U.S. Geological 
Survey said. 
</P>
<P>
 No injuries or serious damage were immediately reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake, which struck a relatively unpopulated area roughly 200 miles 
northeast of the Bolivian capital, La Paz, had a magnitude of between 7.5 and 
8, officials at the Geological Survey said. 
</P>
<P>
 A large swath of North America was jolted by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 It was felt as "a very gentle motion" in Los Angeles, said Jim Mori, head of 
the U.S. Geological Survey in Southern California, at a news conference in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Tremors were also felt in Toronto, the Minneapolis area, Sioux Falls, S.D., 
Omaha and Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sioux City, Iowa, Jane Eckerman said she felt the tremors for two to three 
minutes at her home. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter jumped out of her chair like someone bit her. It was so weird," 
Eckerman told the Sioux City Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chile, police said thousands of people took to the streets in panic in 
Arica, Iquique, Calama and other cities. Power and telephone service were 
knocked out in several cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of people also fled buildings in La Paz, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the earthquake, which struck at 5:33 p.m. PDT, appeared to have 
been very deep, about 400 miles below Earth's surface. 
</P>
<P>
 "The result was that people felt it all over North America, 5,000 miles away 
from the source," Mori said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said earthquake waves travel much more efficiently from that depth, but he 
added, "we wouldn't expect a lot of damage even near the source because it's so 
deep." 
</P>
<P>
 Mori added that the experience with such unusal earthquakes is that there are 
far fewer aftershocks than occur in such quakes as Northridge, which are much 
closer to the surface.

HUNDREDS FEARED DEAD AS COLOMBIA QUAKE TOLL RISES

 Between 250 and 350 people have died in an earthquake and avalanche that 
devastated a remote Colombian river valley, a relief official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Many more are missing and feared dead, according to Juan Manuel Uribe of the 
National Disaster Prevention Office. 
</P>
<P>
 The disaster happened Monday, when a strong earthquake shook the Paez River 
valley, about 180 miles southwest of Bogota, launching a tidal wave of mud that 
swept away settlements, animals and people. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the avalanche cut roads, rescue workers reached many of the affected 
areas only Wednesday. Officials said that the situation was much worse than 
first believed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is really striking, you could never imagine how an avalanche of this size 
could happen in a few hours," President Cesar Gaviria told reporters after a 
brief helicopter visit to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last night, we spent the worst night of our life, everything moved every 
three minutes, the mountain range groaned, the children were screaming, we were 
terrified," survivor Martin Emilio Isaza said. 
</P>
<P>
 The disaster was Colombia's worst natural calamity since September, 1987, when 
a landslide buried part of the Medellin slum of Villa Tina, killing about 600 
people.

U.S. COULD INVADE HAITI ALONE, ENVOY SAYS; CARIBBEAN: PRESIDENT READY TO ACT 
WITHOUT U.N. APPROVAL IF SANCTIONS FAIL, GRAY TELLS HOUSE PANEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Rep. William H. Gray III, the special White House envoy for Haiti, said 
Wednesday that President Clinton should not wait for approval from the United 
Nations or the Organization of American States if he decides to order a U.S. 
invasion to topple the military government. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray said Clinton still intends to see whether stepped-up political and 
economic sanctions can succeed in forcing Haiti's military rulers to leave. But 
in unusually frank testimony about the possibility of an invasion, Gray told 
the House Foreign Affairs Committee that Clinton is ready to consider 
unilateral U.S. military action if the sanctions fail. 
</P>
<P>
 And he said that he would advise Clinton to go ahead without waiting for 
explicit legal backing from any international organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though we are participants in the U.N. (and) the OAS, and we work very 
closely with them . . . ultimately the decision to use a military option must 
be made by the President of the United States, not by an international body," 
Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that Clinton would consult with Congress on the issue but would not 
commit himself to seeking a vote of approval before ordering military action. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray, a former Democratic congressman from Philadelphia, offered his 
saber-rattling statements as part of a two-track Clinton Administration 
strategy aimed at toppling the military regime that seized power in Haiti in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, he said, the Administration is concentrating on tightening 
economic and political sanctions against the Haitian rulers, including a coming 
ban on commercial air flights and a freeze on international financial 
transactions. "We hope that these sanctions will (succeed) . . . but it will 
have to be judged day to day, week to week as to whether or not it's having 
that impact," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If sanctions do not work, he said, Clinton reserves the right to consider 
military action -- and, in any case, America has "a responsibility" to help 
solve the Haitian crisis, he said. Among other reasons Clinton might use force, 
he added, would be if American citizens in the nation are in danger -- although 
he acknowledged that there appears to be no such threat now. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray's statement that Clinton could order an invasion without asking for 
approval from the United Nations or the OAS reflected the Administration's 
continuing turn away from the idealistic multilateralism of its first months in 
office, when officials declared that the military interventions of the future 
would come in U.N. blue. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gray noted that some Latin American and Caribbean nations already 
privately support military action in Haiti. He did not name them but other 
officials said that Argentina, Jamaica and Grenada have all said they would 
support a U.S. invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray also said the United States is making progress in assembling a 
multinational peacekeeping force for Haiti that would take over after the 
military regime falls -- peacefully or because of an invasion. The new force's 
mission, he said, would include protecting Haitian President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide and "helping assure basic civil order." 
</P>
<P>
 Other officials said the new force will not be ready before the middle of July 
-- suggesting that no U.S. military intervention can be contemplated before 
then. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the House committee were deeply skeptical that the sanctions could 
work -- but also deeply divided over whether military action is advisable. 
</P>
<P>
 "American military intervention usually results only in . . . weakening the 
very institutions we want to strengthen," said Rep. Robert G. Torricelli 
(D-N.J.). 
</P>
<P>
 But another liberal Democrat, Rep. James L. Oberstar (D-Minn.), said, "The 
only policy that's going to work to relieve the yoke of oppression is U.S. 
force."

THOUSANDS APPEAR TO HAVE LOST MILLIONS TO A SLICK OPERATOR 
</P>

<P>
 It takes no more than six months to become a millionaire on the lam in Russia 
these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the case of Alexander Melnikov, whom police, victims and City Council 
members name as the main culprit in the rise and fall of the Independent Oil 
Concern, the biggest flimflam money operation to collapse in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Melnikov began with just about 5 million rubles -- roughly $2,500, according 
to Gennady Babakhanov, chairman of the victims' group. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Melnikov got his company registered as the Independent Oil 
Concern, a joint-stock society, even though there was no mention of oil in its 
charter. (Oil bespeaks riches to Russians; one financier quipped that a fund 
could not fail if it named itself "Oil-Diamond-Invest-Sausage-Gold-Mining," 
thus encompassing all the country's main assets.) 
</P>
<P>
 Melnikov became general director and put out advertisements last winter 
offering the highest interest around on investors' money -- 1,010% annually on 
rubles. 
</P>
<P>
 When police and prosecutors later checked the firm's documents, they were all 
reportedly found to be in order. That means, Babakhanov alleged, "it could all 
not have been done without bribes" to the officials who control the red tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Jan. 26, the money began to roll in, largely from pensioners. The 
first quarterly dividends were supposed to be paid to shareholders April 26. 
</P>
<P>
 But suddenly on March 31, the fund's bosses failed to appear and security 
guards called the police and asked them to seal the office because there was 
nothing left for them to protect, Babakhanov said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims' organization puts the number of investors at up to 40,000, each 
having put an average of 1 million rubles -- $500 -- into the kitty, meaning 
the whole pot may have run to about $20 million. Only about $2 million has been 
recovered from a Russian bank, and Babakhanov believes that the rest was 
converted to dollars and may be in banks in France and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe that Melnikov is still in Russia, but he is, as one officer 
understated, "not exactly cooperating with the police investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, they have not managed to bring him in. If they do, police 
said, he could face charges for fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 If Melnikov is found guilty of fraud that brought "major damage" to its 
victims, he could face a prison term of three to 10 years.

CLINTON MAKES THE GRADE AT OLD ENGLISH ALMA MATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Clinton of Hope, Ark., seemed right at home Wednesday as he paid a visit 
to his historic alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite an old grad, the President departed Oxford University in 1970 
without earning his degree in politics. But he returned to don a scarlet gown 
and receive an honorary doctor of civil law degree, amid pageantry laden with 
Latin. 
</P>
<P>
 The President called it a "wonderful day." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton was first hosted at his old school, University College, one of the 
institution's 37 colleges scattered through this lovely city of "dreaming 
spires." The colleges make up the university -- one of the oldest and most 
distinguished in the English-speaking world. 
</P>
<P>
 The master, or head, of University College presented Hillary Rodham Clinton 
with a claret jug, inscribed in Latin that said: "Here's a health from 
University College to the lady in charge of universal health." 
</P>
<P>
 After a lunch of smoked salmon and spring lamb, preceded by grace in Latin, 
Clinton donned his gown and a floppy black academic hat. He walked through the 
quadrangles accompanied by professors in gowns and hoods of red, blue and gold. 
They headed to the Sheldonian Theatre, an architectural gem designed by 
Christopher Wren in 1664 and commissioned by Gilbert Sheldon, Archbishop of 
Canterbury. 
</P>
<P>
 During the ceremony, Clinton could hear a group of young demonstrators. Some 
were members of the Anti-Nazi League, which has protested Clinton's meeting in 
Rome last week with leaders of a party with ties to Italy's fascist past. But 
most were students complaining about higher rents scheduled to take effect at 
the university. 
</P>
<P>
 As one protester admitted: "This has nothing to do with President Clinton. 
This is our chance to attract the attention of the national media here today." 
Another protester, David Renton, said of the rent increase: "If Clinton was the 
man he was at 20, he would be on our side of the barricade." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, during his short acceptance speech, took note of the protests, 
remarking: "This great university has been very much involved in the action and 
passion of its time. Just listen outside here." The audience laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Clinton visited American Rhodes Scholars -- he once was one -- and took 
tea with Douglas Millin, 77, his retired chief porter, in his old college 
rooms. The space had been vacated for the day by the present occupant, Emma 
Caldwell, 18, a first-year law student from Northern Ireland, who said she was 
happy that Clinton's name was placed on her door. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have shoved everything in cupboards," she said. "There is normally a lot of 
mess." 
</P>
<P>
 Teaching has been carried out at Oxford from the 12th Century onward, and its 
name has become synonymous with academic distinction. Since 1750, 24 British 
prime ministers have been its graduates. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the prominent American historical figures schooled here was William 
Penn, as well as the founders of Maryland, Georgia and New Hampshire. Five 
current U.S. senators -- David L. Boren (D-Okla.), Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), 
Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.), Larry Pressler (R-S.D.) and Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) 
-- studied here. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 509 Americans studying here now. And the Yankee fascination with 
Oxford shows no sign of slackening: One million Americans visit the city and 
university each year to take in the quaint streets, quiet quadrangles and 
Thames-side views. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton arrived in 1968 when opposition to the Vietnam War was building. As a 
student, he opposed the war and escaped the draft. With his eyes firmly fixed 
on a political career, he left Oxford before his two years as a Rhodes Scholar 
were up to enroll in Yale Law School. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, like Mark Almond, an Oxford professor and conservative commentator, have 
bitterly complained that Clinton has not established a sufficiently 
distinguished presidential record to deserve an honorary degree from his alma 
mater. 
</P>
<P>
 But that view was not shared by the degree-granting dons and administrators at 
the university, which is in the midst of a $430-million fund-raising drive that 
hopes to attract significant American largess.

BALLOTING TO START FOR STRENGTHENED EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT; ELECTIONS: VOTERS IN 
FOUR EU NATIONS GO TO THE POLLS FRIDAY, THE REST ON SUNDAY. THE LAWMAKERS WILL 
HAVE A ROLE REVIEWING THE MAASTRICHT TREATY.

<P>
 Citizens of the 12-nation European Union begin voting Friday to elect members 
to their international Parliament, a body that has recently gained important 
new powers but remains remote and mysterious to most of its constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 Elections to the 567-seat European Parliament will start with voting in 
Britain, Ireland, Denmark and the Netherlands. They finish Sunday in the EU's 
eight other member states. Preliminary results in what are the world's only 
multinational elections are expected late Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The elections are considered the most important since the assembly was created 
more than 40 years ago for one simple reason -- as Western Europe moves toward 
deeper economic and political integration, the European Parliament has gained 
more strength. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, it still is overshadowed by traditional power bases in national 
legislative assemblies. Even within the EU, it is the member states, sitting 
collectively as the Council of Ministers, that hold real sway. The Parliament 
also suffers key shortcomings, including an inability to introduce its own 
bills or to deal with foreign policy matters. 
</P>
<P>
 But the European Parliament today is a far cry from its modest origins as a 
toothless, consultative arm of the European Coal and Steel Community in the 
early 1950s. It presides over the EU's $80-billion annual budget, and since the 
Maastricht Treaty took effect in November, it has gained "co-decision" 
authority with the council in several areas, including education, the 
environment and consumer affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 It has also won the right to review and veto key appointments to the Union's 
Executive Commission and reject new prospective member states -- an especially 
important power as the new, post-Communist democracies in Central and Eastern 
Europe begin to line up for membership. 
</P>
<P>
 Of far greater potential significance, however, is the promised role for the 
new Parliament in the 1996 intergovernmental conference that will review the 
Maastricht Treaty -- a de facto constitutional convention on the future of 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "The elections of 1994 offer voters a greater chance than ever before to 
influence decision-making in Western Europe," concluded a study released 
recently by the London-based Royal Institute of International Affairs. "For the 
first time, they will be electing (members) who have the potential to exert a 
real impact on legislation." 
</P>
<P>
 The Parliament is expected to grow more in stature and importance as measures 
mount to build a greater degree of direct democracy into the process of 
European unification. 
</P>
<P>
 It is already one of the world's more unusual elected assemblies. Its 
elections are conducted under 12 sets of ground rules. Voters will choose a 
Parliament that debates in nine languages, whose home is considered to be 
Strasbourg, France, but whose 19 committees reside in Brussels and whose 
records are kept in Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
 Public interest in the elections has been low, debates on crucial European 
issues are infrequent and knowledge about the candidates is virtually 
nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I work in the European policy field, and I don't even know the candidates 
running in my constituency," admitted Franz-Josef Meiers, a researcher at the 
German Foreign Policy Assn. in Bonn. "These people are invisible." 
</P>
<P>
 There are exceptions, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer Nana Mouskouri is running in Greece. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi 
heads the Forza Italia (Go Italy) candidate list in Italy. Two former prime 
ministers are among the Christian Democratic hopefuls in Belgium, while former 
Prime Minister Poul Schlueter is campaigning for one of Denmark's 16 seats. In 
France, Michel Rocard, leader of the opposition Socialists, and Jean-Marie Le 
Pen, of the ultra-rightist National Front, are candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the hopefuls, a handful of fiery, colorful individuals have even forced 
real European issues into the campaign on occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 In Germany, a disgruntled former Brussels bureaucrat named Manfred Brunner, 
who heads a group called the Free Citizens' League, has railed against 
corruption in the EU bureaucracy and the Union's liberal subsidies to poor 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
 In France, a slate running under the name The Other Europe advocates European 
political integration, new tariffs to protect internal markets and 
renegotiation of recently completed world trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the most part, the campaign has been dominated by big parties and 
national political figures, who have co-opted the election, making it more a 
series of domestic referendums than a vote on the future shape of a united 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 In Italy, the election is seen mainly as an initial test for Berlusconi's new 
government in Rome; in Spain, it will be judged as a barometer of Prime 
Minister Felipe Gonzalez's attempts to stay in power. In Germany, this contest 
is considered only one of several preliminary rounds ahead of next October's 
main event -- the Bundestag elections. In Britain, the only real issue is the 
future of John Major's beleaguered government, which does not seem bright.

13 RWANDAN CLERGYMEN SLAIN BY REBELS

<P>
 Thirteen Rwandan clergymen, including the Roman Catholic archbishop of Kigali 
and two bishops, were killed by four rebel soldiers assigned to guard them, 
Rwandan rebel radio said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Radio Muhabura, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp., said three of the 
soldiers fled and a fourth was shot and killed by other rebel guards.A search 
was under way to find the escaped soldiers and bring them to trial before a 
military tribunal, the radio said. 
</P>
<P>
 The guards believed the clergymen had taken part in massacres of their 
relatives, the radio said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Col. Frank Mugambage, political director of the rebel Rwandan Patriotic 
Front, had said Tuesday that the rebels "don't really have any evidence" 
against the clergymen, slain as they ate dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 500,000 people have been killed in massacres and civil war that erupted 
after Rwanda's president, a member of the majority Hutu ethnic group, died in a 
suspicious plane crash April 6. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kigali, meanwhile, a third round of cease-fire talks began between the 
Hutu-led government and Tutsi rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Gen. Romeo Dallaire, a Canadian who commands the 450-member U.N. presence 
in Rwanda, said the parties had begun detailed discussion of a cease-fire 
document drawn up by the U.N. command in Kigali.

EXTREMISTS KILL 15 IN PHILIPPINES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Followers of a Muslim extremist massacred at least 15 people Wednesday and 
took others hostage after waylaying a civilian convoy on a southern island. 
</P>
<P>
 In another southern city, a bomb exploded at a department store, killing two 
sidewalk vendors and a pedestrian and injuring 34 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Gen. Orlando Soriano said the bombing in General Santos City was 
apparently carried out by Muslim fundamentalists to avenge last week's military 
operation against them. 
</P>
<P>
 In a note to military commanders, President Fidel V. Ramos ordered an "all-out 
offensive and law enforcement actions against the perpetrators, but consider 
the safe recovery" of the hostages. 
</P>
<P>
 Soriano said 15 bodies were recovered from the massacre site in Upper 
Kapayawan, a village on Basilan island. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the gunmen were holding a priest and 15 other hostages, mostly women 
teachers and hospital workers, all Christians.

ATTEMPT TO OUST ALL HIV-INFECTED MILITARY PERSONNEL FAILS IN HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An effort by an Orange County congressman to oust from the military all 
service members who are HIV-positive or are restricted by a chronic illness was 
defeated Wednesday when the House approved a milder version that would allow 
discharge but would not require it. 
</P>
<P>
 The requirement drafted by Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) as part of 
the annual defense authorization bill could have led to the immediate discharge 
of any member of the military whose assignment is limited by HIV, asthma, heart 
disease, cancer or diabetes, among other ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 But an offense mounted by Rep. Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey) succeeded in 
heading off Dornan's plan -- passed by the House Armed Services Committee last 
month -- putting an end to a provision that could have removed about 3,600 
service members. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who are sick and serve well should be able to get well," Harman said 
before her amendment carried, 227 to 192. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dornan provision was approved by the Armed Services Committee last month 
in what was later described by some as a harried, uninformed vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Current military policy dictates that service members restricted by a medical 
condition be classified as "non-worldwide assignable," meaning they are limited 
to serving stateside. Pentagon officials have testified that the existing 
policy works fine. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dornan argued that the policy places an unfair burden on healthier service 
members and is foolish in an era of dwindling defense budgets.

HEALTH BILL FINANCING PLAN CLEARS HURDLE; LEGISLATION: A GOP CHALLENGE TO 
EMPLOYER MANDATE IS DEFEATED IN ONE SENATE PANEL. U.S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE 
SEEKS PLEDGES TO VOTE AGAINST THE IDEA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton's plan requiring employers to pay the lion's share of health 
care insurance costs cleared a first, small hurdle in the Senate Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats on the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee fought off a 
Republican effort to delete the so-called employer mandate from the health care 
reform bill that the committee is drafting. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the early demonstration of support for the mandate, it remained 
clear that the concept faces a steep uphill fight. 
</P>
<P>
 The more decisive Senate battleground will be the Finance Committee, where 
sources said Chairman Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) is preparing to include 
the mandate in the first draft of his health care bill when he presents it to 
his committee today. Members there are sharply divided over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile Wednesday, in a move designed to turn up the heat on the issue even 
further, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce launched a grass-roots campaign against 
the mandate, asking lawmakers to pledge in writing that they will not vote for 
it -- or for any new business taxes -- to pay for overhauling the health care 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) responded by releasing a 
letter from more than 1,300 organizations and businesses calling the employer 
mandate "a fair, effective and practical means for achieving universal 
coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 The fate of the funding mechanism remains crucial to the Administration's 
entire health reform effort. In the most controversial part of his bill, the 
President has proposed that -- with some exceptions -- employers should pay 80% 
of their employees' health care premiums. Supporters of the concept say that it 
is the only way to meet Clinton's most basic goal of assuring health care 
coverage for all Americans, while opponents insist that it will cripple or 
destroy thousands of small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The inability to reach some consensus on the issue has been the biggest 
stumbling block facing all five of the committees trying to write health reform 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the test of the mandate in the Senate Labor panel, Democrats won a 10-7 
partisan vote to defeat a GOP proposal to eliminate the employer mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 But the committee also voted to go further than its chairman, Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy (D-Mass.), or the President had suggested in easing the burden of the 
mandate on small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton originally proposed giving government subsidies to small firms with 
low-paid workers to help them pay insurance premium costs. In a first draft of 
the bill, Kennedy went further by proposing to exempt businesses employing five 
or fewer workers from the mandate and requiring instead that they pay a 2% 
payroll tax. 
</P>
<P>
 An amendment by Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), approved, 11 to 6, Wednesday, 
exempts companies with as many as 10 workers and lowers the payroll tax to 1% 
for those with five or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. James M. Jeffords (R-Vt.) joined Democrats in supporting Bingaman's 
amendment. He is also the only Republican to support Clinton's plan and is 
expected to be the only GOP member to vote for the committee bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, sources said that Moynihan's first draft of health reform 
legislation, known in the parlance of Capitol Hill as a "chairman's mark," 
would include an 80% employer mandate similar to Clinton's, except that it 
would offer an exemption for the smallest businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan's apparent intentions came as a surprise to many, because he has been 
so openly skeptical of the Clinton approach. 
</P>
<P>
 In one explanation, observers contended that the chairman had grown tired of 
being portrayed as an obstacle to health reform and hoped to make it clear that 
he is ready to give the President's bill a chance to pass. But that move almost 
certainly would mean abandoning his efforts to bring Republicans on board and 
wrestling to bring the committee's fragile Democratic majority in line. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the Capitol, in an event loaded with symbolism, incoming House Ways and 
Means Chairman Sam Gibbons (D-Fla.) conducted his first caucus with committee 
Democrats since taking the helm of the panel from Rep. Dan Rostenkowski 
(D-Ill.). Under House Democratic rules, Rostenkowski was forced to step down 
after he was indicted last week on corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski, who remains a member of the committee, attended the session 
called by Gibbons to discuss the health bill that he put forward Monday. 
"Sam'll do the job," Rostenkowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 The full Ways and Means Committee will meet today.

AGRICULTURE SECRETARY IS SUBJECT OF PROBE 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Justice Department is investigating reports that Agriculture Secretary 
Mike Espy accepted free travel and tickets to a sporting event from Tyson Foods 
Inc. of Arkansas, the country's largest poultry firm, a spokesman said late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Secretary Espy welcomes this review and what he believes will be a positive 
outcome," said Agriculture Department spokesman Steve Kinsella. 
</P>
<P>
 The inquiry raises further doubts expressed by critics of the department as to 
whether the Administration is treating sanitary inspections of the poultry 
industry more leniently than the beef industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The criticism stems from Tyson's connection to President Clinton, former 
governor of Arkansas. James Blair, Tyson's general counsel, and his wife, 
Diane, are close friends of the Clintons. And Tyson Foods is represented by 
Hillary Rodham Clinton's former law firm, Rose Law Firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinsella refused to comment on a New York Times report in today's editions 
that the inquiry has broadened to travel and lodging Espy received from Tyson 
when Espy visited Arkansas in May, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The inquiry began after the Agriculture Department's inspector general 
referred information to the FBI, the newspaper reported.

Chiles.Under the program, believed to be the first in the nation, officials 
will release for deportation 113 nonviolent offenders, the bulk of them from 
nations in South America and the Caribbean. Roughly two-thirds of the offenders 
were scheduled for release within three years. The group is being deported to

 Ralph Neas, the executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil 
Rights, announced Wednesday that he will resign the post he has held for nearly 
14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Neas announced his resignation less than two weeks after Benjamin L. Hooks 
departed as chairman of the conference, which serves as the legislative arm of 
the civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Conference members include 185 national organizations representing minorities, 
women, homosexuals, religious groups, disabled people, senior citizens and 
labor groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Neas, 48, has led the group's work on Capitol Hill and at the White House 
since 1981. He said he would practice and teach law, write and do some 
consulting after stepping down next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Neas and Hooks served mainly during Republican administrations that were not 
particularly sympathetic to the causes they espoused. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most frustrating aspect of the Reagan-Bush presidencies is that they 
forced the nation, the Congress and the leadership conference to refight the 
civil rights battles that had been won in the 1960s and '70s," Neas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those battles were won once again, but everyone had to devote an 
extraordinary amount of time and energy and resources to waging these 
rear-guard actions," he said.

WIDOW FOUND GUILTY IN SLAYING OF GULF WAR VETERAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman who sobbed on national television after her husband was fatally shot 
outside his home sat stone-faced Wednesday as a jury pronounced her guilty of 
the Persian Gulf War veteran's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Toni Cato Riggs, 25, faces a mandatory life sentence for first-degree murder 
and conspiracy to commit murder convictions in the March, 1991, death of Army 
Spec.Anthony Riggs. Sentencing was set for June 24. 
</P>
<P>
 The slaying drew national attention over the irony of Riggs' safe return from 
war only to be killed in what initially was thought to be random violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Cato Riggs persuaded her husband to take out a $150,000 life 
insurance policy before he left. When he returned, prosecutors said, she 
arranged for his death so she could collect. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution's case centered on a series of secretly recorded videotapes of 
Cato Riggs confessing to plotting her husband's death. 
</P>
<P>
 She was seen trying to get a job with men she thought were the heads of drug 
families but were actually undercover Drug Enforcement Administration agents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tapes were very conclusive, they did not ask her for any information, she 
volunteered -- too much," said jury forewoman Jeannette Hayes-Hollis. 
</P>
<P>
 Cato Riggs did not take the stand in her defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was tricked into this confession," said defense attorney Athina Siringas. 
An appeal is planned, Siringas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cato Riggs' brother, Michael Cato, was previously convicted of being the 
triggerman and is serving life in prison.

were in court for the sentencing, which concluded his first trial. Rifkin, 34, 
showed no emotion as Nassau County Judge Ira Wexner sentenced him to 25 years 
to life for murder plus 2 1/3 years for reckless endangerment for the killing 
of Tiffany Bresciani, 22.

 Angry White House officials sharply rebuked the political director of the 
Democratic National Committee after he was quoted as saying Democratic 
candidates should distance themselves from President Clinton in their campaigns 
if that is what it will take to win. Don Sweitzer's comments undermined White 
House efforts to assure nervous Democrats that Clinton will not be a liability 
to them in the fall elections. In an interview with the Washington Times, 
Sweitzer was quoted as saying, "There are clearly some areas of the country 
where it is not going to benefit a candidate to associate himself with Bill 
Clinton, and if you want us to stay away, we'll stay away."

 New York City's largest rooming house was seized by the federal government in 
a bid to end drug dealing and murders there.Shortly before the 621-room Kenmore 
Hotel was seized, eight rooms were searched for drugs and 18 people were 
arrested, police said. The hotel houses a large number of people who rely on 
government aid, and it will continue to operate under the direction of a 
management company, officials said. The hotel's hotel, Tran Dinh Truong, is not

WILSON HASTENS TO O.C. WITH CALL FOR PARTY UNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson made a lightning-fast trip to Orange County on Wednesday just 
hours after the primary election to mend fences with Republicans who voted for 
his challenger Ron Unz and to shore up support among the party faithful. 
</P>
<P>
 About 300 Wilson supporters crammed into a muggy, sixth-floor office here in a 
show of unity behind the Republican ticket. Attendees included some of the 
winners and losers from Tuesday's primary races and conservatives and moderates 
alike. 
</P>
<P>
 During a brief speech, Wilson stressed that come the Nov. 8 general election, 
when he faces Democrat Kathleen Brown, he expects Orange County to deliver the 
winning votes as it has in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect Orange County to do the job that it always has," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and the local Republican leadership downplayed the level of support Unz 
received here. According to semi-official results, Unz won 43% of the vote in 
Orange County, compared to 33% statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Wilson has always carried Orange County," said Thomas A. Fuentes, 
chairman of the county Republican Committee. "We've done it before for Pete 
Wilson in Orange County and we'll do it again." 
</P>
<P>
 Others called Unz's surprising success in Orange County a "wake-up call" for 
Wilson -- a warning from those who feel the governor has strayed too far from 
the conservative base that elected him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he'll be paying more attention to certain conservative issues," said 
Harold W. Ezell, one of the major supporters of a Wilson-sponsored initiative 
that would prevent children of undocumented workers from attending public 
schools and receiving a host of other federal benefits. "I think he's got a 
tough challenge ahead of him, but there's a lot of baggage with that Brown 
name." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ho Chung, a Garden Grove councilman: "A lot of people think he's not 
conservative enough, so they supported someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now that the primary's over, it's all clear. As Republicans, we have no 
one else to support but Pete Wilson." 
</P>
<P>
 In his speech to the gathering, Wilson hammered on the themes that have been 
the rallying cry of his campaign. These included his support of the "three 
strikes" crime bill, tougher judicial treatment of violent juvenile offenders 
and tough action to stem illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not going to rest until we reach as many people as we can reach 
because we have a lot riding on it," he said.

DORNAN'S MILITARY OUSTER PROPOSAL FAILS; LEGISLATION: O.C. CONGRESSMAN'S EFFORT 
TO REMOVE SERVICE MEMBERS WHO ARE LIMITED BY HIV OR OTHER AILMENTS IS 
SUPPLANTED BY A MILDER VERSION IN THE HOUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An effort by an Orange County congressman to oust from the military all 
service members who are HIV-positive or are restricted by a chronic illness was 
defeated Wednesday when the House approved a milder version that would allow 
discharge but would not require it. 
</P>
<P>
 The requirement drafted by Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) as part of 
the annual defense authorization bill could have led to the immediate discharge 
of any member of the military whose assignment is limited by HIV, asthma, heart 
disease, cancer or diabetes, among other ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 But an offense mounted by Rep. Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey) succeeded in 
heading off Dornan's plan -- passed by the House Armed Services Committee last 
month -- putting an end to a provision that could have removed about 3,600 
service members. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who are sick and serve well should be able to get well," Harman said 
before her amendment carried, 227 to 192. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dornan provision was approved by the Armed Services Committee last month 
in what was later described by some as a harried, uninformed vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Current military policy dictates that service members restricted by a medical 
condition be classified as "non-worldwide assignable," meaning they are limited 
to serving stateside. Pentagon officials have testified that the existing 
policy works just fine. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dornan argued that the policy places an unfair burden on healthier service 
members and is foolish in an era of dwindling defense budgets, when every 
military member must be at the ready. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan later acknowledged that his greatest concern was ridding the service of 
HIV-infected members, those, as he put it, "who broke the law by sticking a 
needle in their arm." 
</P>
<P>
 His plan was opposed not only by the Pentagon but by a roster of gay rights 
groups and medical associations, including the American Cancer Society and the 
American Heart Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 If similar language is passed by the Senate, the Harman amendment would still 
effect a new policy -- although a much less radical one -- that would allow 
discharge on a case-by-case basis if military officials see fit.

MAN SLAIN, FRIEND WOUNDED IN HOLDUP AT BIG BEAR LAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 In the second such fatal shooting in a month in nearby mountains, a Montebello 
man was killed and another man was wounded Wednesday when they and two fishing 
buddies were attacked alongside Big Bear Lake, the San Bernardino County 
Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four men had set off for an early-morning fishing trip to the popular 
mountain lake and were resting in their station wagon before heading for the 
water when they were attacked, said Deputy Laurie Savage, a sheriff's 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 The assailant robbed the men and, as he fled, turned around and shot into the 
car, striking two men in the back seat, Savage said. Armen Shakkharamian, 47, 
was killed. His companion, Sarkis Aylozlan, 28, of North Hollywood, was struck 
in the torso and was expected to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Two others in the car were unhurt. Sheriff's officials identified them as 
Khachic Gumuryan, 28, of Van Nuys, and his brother, Nazar Gumuryan, 36, of 
North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The four arrived before dawn at the lake, situated in the San Bernardino 
Mountains, and were inside their vehicle near the lake's Boulder Bay when a 
stranger knocked on a window about 5 a.m., Savage said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the driver rolled down the window, the suspect produced a handgun and 
demanded their money," she said. "The victims complied with his demand and 
remained in their vehicle as he left." 
</P>
<P>
 But as the gunman neared the back of the vehicle, "he suddenly began firing 
into their car, striking both victims who were sitting in the back seat," 
Savage said. 
</P>
<P>
 After blasting a hole in one side of the station wagon, the gunman fled, 
Savage said. The California Highway Patrol reported the crash of the 
assailant's car shortly afterward, about five miles from the shooting scene on 
a winding stretch of California 18 that leads to Green Valley Lake. The 
vehicle, a white Buick registered to a Fontana man, was found abandoned with 
one of the victims' wallets inside, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a 12-hour search by sheriff's helicopters, trackers and deputies of the 
area's woods and ravines yielded no clues to the assailant's whereabouts, 
Savage said. Survivors of the attack told police that a picture of the 
registered owner of the apparent getaway car did not appear to be the gunman, 
she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Savage said the fishermen drove to a nearby trailer park for help, and the 
gunshot victims were taken to nearby medical facilities for treatment. Aylozlan 
was listed in good condition Wednesday night at Loma Linda University Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting, which came just weeks before the opening of tourist season at 
the peaceful, pine-shaded resort, was similar to one May 16 in the San Jacinto 
Mountains near Idyllwild that claimed the life of a German tourist. Her husband 
was seriously injured by assailants after the couple pulled over at a scenic 
turnout. Authorities said the motive was robbery.

DONATIONS FLOW IN FOR FAMILY HURT IN FIRE; INVESTIGATION: OFFICIALS CAUTIOUSLY 
CONSIDER ARSON AS A POSSIBLE CAUSE IN OJAI BLAZE. THEY PLAN TO RE-INTERVIEW 
FAMILY MEMBERS IN AN ATTEMPT TO RECONCILE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE WITH ACCOUNTS FROM 
WITNESSES.

 Donations poured in Wednesday for a family whose Ojai Valley home was 
destroyed by fire, but investigators said they are moving cautiously in 
determining whether the fire was deliberately set. 
</P>
<P>
 Although still looking at the fire as a possible arson, investigators said 
they plan to re-interview family members to try to resolve differences between 
the witnesses' account of the blaze and physical evidence gathered at the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire patterns don't match up with what the witnesses are stating," said 
Nina Raya, a spokeswoman for the Ventura County Fire Department. "What 
(investigators) are doing right now is re-evaluating the witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to make sure they're telling the truth," she said, adding that 
investigators so far have not ruled out any possible causes of the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Wednesday, an FBI agent interviewed at least one of the victims. The 
FBI's involvement came after a call by the Ventura County NAACP Tuesday to 
investigate potential civil rights violations. The agent declined to discuss 
details of the interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Lonnie Stanford and other members of his family, who are African American, 
said they are convinced that the fire -- which injured three people -- was an 
arson attack motivated by racial hatred. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't prove anything, but holes don't get there by themselves," said 
Stanford, referring to what he told investigators was a hole in his living room 
window moments before the fire engulfed his house. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I know is (the fire) didn't start in the house," said Lonnie Stanford's 
wife, Winnie, who was treated for smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
 As for discrepancies cited by arson investigators, Stanford said: "I'm not a 
fire inspector. All we're doing is saying what we saw, and we hope they can 
determine what really went on." 
</P>
<P>
 Property owner Robert M. Featherston, a former insurance company investigator 
for 12 years, also said the fire was deliberately set. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out," said Featherston, who 
on Tuesday was one of the first people to offer the family help. "I knew it was 
a hate crime." 
</P>
<P>
 The Stanfords have been relocated to an Ojai motel by the American Red Cross 
until they find a temporary place to live. But they vowed Wednesday to rebuild 
the charred Grande Vista Street home. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, donations to the family of cash and clothing were piling up at a 
number of Ojai Valley firehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 sacks of clothing had been dropped off at fire stations by late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical of the cash donations was a $100 bill that an unidentified man handed 
to Fire Investigator Norman Plott as others were gathering up the gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just amazed at the public response," Plott said. "The generosity has been 
unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze, which caused $150,000 in damage, broke out about 4 a.m. Tuesday 
near the living room of the Stanfords' leased home in Oak View. Family members 
said they first heard "a big pop," then discovered flames roiling through the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 But a trained dog failed to sniff out incendiary devices or other potential 
sources of fuel, in part prompting investigators to re-examine the Stanfords' 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze occurred within a few weeks of a request by 13-year-old Shuwana 
Stanford to graduate with her former classmates at Matilija Junior High School 
in Ojai. She withdrew from courses in January in favor of a home-schooling 
program after she was targeted by a series of racial threats at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuwana, the most seriously injured with first- and second-degree burns about 
her head and face, said Wednesday that she is still determined to graduate with 
her class June 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a part of my life," she said. "It'll show them that I'm not afraid."

EXPERT SEES 90% CHANCE OF BIG BAY AREA QUAKE BY 2020 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The chance of a major earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area by 2020 has 
climbed to near certain, according to a scientist who warns that new faults 
were found after the devastating 1989 Loma Prieta quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "A 90% likelihood is probably not unreasonable," David Schwartz, a 
seismologist for the U.S. Geological Survey, told a conference on earthquake 
hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago the agency forecast a 67% chance of a killer quake by 2020. 
</P>
<P>
 But since the October, 1989, quake, researchers have found new faults or 
suspected faults, including two in the southern half of San Francisco Bay that 
run under or close to San Francisco International Airport, Candlestick Park and 
the San Mateo Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oct. 17, 1989, earthquake had a magnitude of 7.0, killed 63 people and 
caused more than $6 billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Significant new information has been obtained on the behavior and location of 
faults in the region," Schwartz told a San Francisco conference on seismic 
hazards this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing evidence indicates that some Bay Area faults are potentially deadlier 
than anyone guessed four years ago. Researchers also found that some faults are 
slipping faster than originally suspected. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers used sonar-like devices on boats to map hidden faults beneath 
the bay and detonated explosives to map faults under hills and valleys. Other 
tools included instruments that measured the millimeter-by-millimeter creep of 
faults.

SCHOOL TOLD TO TAKE BACK OUSTED BOY, 6

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge Wednesday ordered the Ocean View School District to take 
6-year-old Jimmy Peters back into his kindergarten class for the final week of 
the school year, ruling that administrators had not proved that the child is 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy, who was removed from his class May 25 after the school district filed a 
lawsuit contending that his learning disabilities make him uncontrollable, will 
return in time for year-end activities at Circle View Elementary School under 
the ruling issued by U.S. District Judge Matthew Byrne. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has attracted attention because it pits the rights of students with 
special needs -- whose parents increasingly are demanding that they be taught 
in mainstream classrooms -- against their peers' desire to learn without 
unreasonable distractions. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials filed suit against Jimmy, asking a judge to remove him from 
the mainstream class because of what they claimed was violent behavior. 
According to state law, a disabled child cannot be removed from a class unless 
the district has a parent's permission or a judge's order.

BOND DEFEATS ANOTHER SETBACK FOR CSUN; POLLS: VOTERS TURN DOWN $2-BILLION 
EARTHQUAKE RELIEF MEASURE AND $900-MILLION HIGHER EDUCATION BOND ISSUE, FUNDS

 Cal State Northridge, still trying to recover from the January temblor, 
endured an insult atop its injuries Wednesday with the defeat of statewide bond 
measures that would have helped its rebuilding effort as well as funded new 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The university is relying on federal disaster funds to pay 90% of its 
$350-million earthquake recovery costs but needs the state to kick in the 
remaining 10%. Tuesday's sound defeat of Proposition 1A, the $2-billion 
earthquake relief measure, may hinder the state's ability to raise its share, 
university officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're well on our way to recovering from the earthquake in terms of repair 
and getting back into the classrooms. The only thing that could slow us down at 
this point is (the situation with) state or federal funding," CSUN spokesman 
Bruce Erickson said. "We're taking them at their word that they'll help us." 
</P>
<P>
 Voters also torpedoed Proposition 1C, a $900-million higher education bond 
issue, by 53% to 47%, denying CSUN an extra $27 million it would have devoted 
to campus modernizations in the coming year. The money was to erect a new 
central utilities plant, equip the university's new engineering wing and 
strengthen the Sierra Tower building's ability to withstand a future temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the future of those plans -- as well as projects worth $34 million that 
were to be covered by the second year of the bond issue -- is in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are in limbo," Erickson said. "There's no other obvious (funding) 
alternative at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 As at CSUN, most of the projects statewide to be funded by Proposition 1C 
involved seismic strengthening, modernizing facilities and making buildings 
accessible to disabled students. Gov. Pete Wilson said Wednesday that state 
officials would examine whether other sources of money might be available to 
help with the retrofitting of public campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what we're going to find is there is sufficient unused bonding for 
that purpose to take care of the retrofit of the schools," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rejection of Proposition 1C also dealt a blow to community colleges in the 
San Fernando and surrounding valleys, which had hoped for $16 million in bond 
money to upgrade buildings and free up other funds to construct more 
classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 At College of the Canyons in Santa Clarita, nearly $6 million was to be 
applied toward erecting a new utilities plant and outfitting a new fine arts 
building and library. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the fine arts building and the library are to begin construction this 
summer with previously approved funds but now stand in danger of sitting empty 
when finished because of a lack of funds to furnish and power them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very serious issue for us," said Dianne van Hook, 
superintendent-president of the college. "We have been turning away 3- to 4,000 
students a semester, and we're out of space. . . . These two buildings were 
going to help us make big strides in accommodating them." 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat of Proposition 1C follows a trend of declining support for 
higher-education bond measures over the past several years. Although four of 
five such measures have been approved in California since 1986, the share of 
voters favoring them has dwindled. 
</P>
<P>
 "When bond issues come up now, I think they come under much greater scrutiny 
than they did before," said Paul Clarke, a Northridge political consultant. 
"One of the things that the voters have learned is that eventually somebody 
pays for these things. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is perhaps a feeling that it's more of a luxury than a necessity," he 
said of higher-education bond proposals. "It's starting to be perceived by 
voters as falling in the same category of other school bonds that don't pass. 
And I think the voters were in an anti-spending mood all the way around." 
</P>
<P>
 But Barry Munitz, chancellor of the Cal State University system, warned that 
the unwillingness of the public to finance higher-education projects would have 
dire consequences for campuses that have become increasingly crowded and 
strapped for cash. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five years from now and 10 years from now, hundreds of thousands of students 
and their families will ask, 'Why is there no place to go?' And then they will 
be mystified," he said.

LOCAL ELECTIONS; THE TIMES POLL; CRIME TOPS VOTERS' LIST OF CONCERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reflecting statewide worries, voters in the San Fernando and Santa Clarita 
valleys cited crime and immigration as top issues in the primary election, 
registering a deep discontent that cuts across party lines. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Northridge earthquake -- which caused hundreds of millions of dollars 
in damage -- barely registered a response, according to exit polls conducted by 
The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Among all who voted, 74% said they are displeased with the direction of 
California, citing crime, immigration and education as the most important 
issues in the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Although only 20% of local voters say they are better off financially than 
they were four years ago, they ranked the economy and jobs fourth among top 
election issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake recovery was ranked last among 11 issues polled -- listed by 
only 3% of voters as important -- behind health care, the environment, state 
budget, ethics in government and bringing business into the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 59% of local voters supported the earthquake relief bond measure, 
Proposition 1A, far from an overwhelming response to the disaster that was 
centered in the San Fernando Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 "If it only gets 60% in the Valley, it's going to lose all over," said John 
Brennan, director of The Times Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure received 46% of the vote statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, local voters mirrored voters statewide, with majorities casting 
ballots for state Treasurer Kathleen Brown and Gov. Pete Wilson, according to 
1,088 interviews with Democratic and Republican party voters and conducted at 
25 polling places in the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys. The poll has a 
margin of sampling error four points in either direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Democrats, Brown won 46% of the local vote compared to 48% statewide, 
according to the poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson received 58% of Republican votes in the two valleys, compared to 62% 
throughout California, according to the poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-place finishers John Garamendi and Ron Unz both received about the same 
proportion of votes locally as they did statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 As she did statewide, Brown drew support from liberal Democrats in the area, 
while Wilson was supported by moderates and conservatives, according to the 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, 44% of primary voters said that in a head-to-head race they would 
support Wilson, while 37% favor Brown. Wilson has a similar edge among voters 
statewide, according to the poll. 
</P>
<P>
 "But those numbers may not reflect the larger November electorate," Brennan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally and statewide, 60% of the voters say they disapprove of the way Gov. 
Wilson is doing his job.  
</P>
<P>
 In the state treasurer's race, state Sen. David Roberti of Van Nuys received a 
bare majority, 51%, among area voters in his unsuccessful run. He lost in the 
Democratic Party primary to Phil Angelides, who collected 55% of the vote 
statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 Local voters who cast ballots in Tuesday's primary election were -- as in past 
years -- overwhelmingly white, older, more affluent and better educated than 
the area's adult population in general. 
</P>
<P>
 Whites comprise a little more than half of the Valley's 1.2 million residents, 
with Latinos more than one-third. But in Tuesday's primary election, whites 
accounted for 89% of Republican Party voters and 84% of Democratic Party 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos accounted for about 5% of the votes cast in both parties. 
</P>
<P>
 More than one-third of Democratic and 31% of Republican voters polled locally 
said they were 60 years of age and older. Nearly 70% of local voters in both 
parties earn more than $40,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Local Democratic voters report higher earnings than their counterparts 
statewide, with 41% having incomes greater than $60,000 compared to only 31% in 
the rest of the state who say they earn that much. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, Jewish voters accounted for 29% of Democratic Party votes, compared 
to 6% statewide. The high proportion, along with the high percentage of senior 
citizen voters, is indicative of the low voter turnout. Both Jewish and senior 
voters tend to cast ballots, even in low-turnout elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a few exceptions -- the large Jewish vote, for example -- Valley voters 
are a pretty fair representation of voters statewide," Brennan said. "And like 
voters statewide, their top issues are crime, immigration, education and the 
economy." How the Poll Was Conducted The Times Poll interviewed 5,234 voters, 
including 2,656 Democratic and 2,275 Republican primary voters as they exited 
110 polling places across the state. The poll included an over sample of 1,088 
voters in the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys, including 610 Democrats 
and 426 Republicans interviewed at 25 polling places. Precincts were chosen 
based on the pattern of turnout in past primary elections. The survey was by 
confidential questionnaire. The margin of sampling error for percentages based 
on the entire statewide sample is plus or minus 3 percentage points; for the 
valleys' sample it is 4 points. For some subgroups the error margin may be 
somewhat higher. Because the survey does not include absentee voters or those 
who declined to participate when approached, actual returns and demographic 
estimates by the interviewers were used to slightly adjust the sample.

LOCAL ELECTIONS; PROP. 180'S DEFEAT PUTS THE SQUEEZE ON PARKS AGENCY; SANTA 
MONICAS: CONSERVANCY FACES LAYOFFS. PURCHASE OF LAND IN TOPANGA CANYON IS NOW 
IN DOUBT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A day after voters rejected a $2-billion bond measure to buy parkland, the 
Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy found itself Wednesday in a familiar 
situation: underfunded and under fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 180 would have directed more than $85 million to the state agency 
to acquire open land in the Santa Monica Mountains between Griffith Park and 
Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the conservancy and a sister agency -- the Mountains Recreation and 
Conservation Authority -- will be forced to lay off more than one-third of 
their staffs and put off critical property acquisitions as their limited 
funding dwindles even further, said Joseph T. Edmiston, the conservancy's 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Edmiston refused to concede total defeat. He said the conservancy is 
still owed more than $13 million by the National Park Service for other 
acquisitions in the mountains and still has small amounts of cash in accounts 
earmarked for special projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to sit back and say, 'The people have spoken,' and let the 
environment of Santa Monica Mountains go down the tubes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Proposition 180's failure puts into question whether the conservancy will 
be able to pull off what was heralded a few months ago as one of its greatest 
accomplishments: the last-minute, $19.9-million purchase of Canyon Oaks 
Estates, a huge swath of Topanga Canyon proposed for development. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics outside the agency doubt whether the conservancy will be able to 
come up with the $5.8 million it still owes on part of the property before next 
year, when the developer is entitled to propose a new project on that parcel. 
</P>
<P>
 And even some of the conservancy's staunchest allies grumble that the 
high-profile purchase of Canyon Oaks was a high-priced mistake that leaves the 
agency without enough money to buy other important parcels at a time when 
vacant land is at its lowest prices in years. 
</P>
<P>
 The $19.9-million cost of Canyon Oaks was the highest price paid for a single 
property since the conservancy was created in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy officials conceded when they bought Canyon Oaks in April that they 
did not have enough money to close the entire deal. They even put other 
acquisitions on hold to come up with the initial payment of $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
 They counted on Proposition 180 not only to round out the remainder of the 
Canyon Oaks money, but also to put back on track the other purchases, which 
some contend are of greater ecological and recreational use than Canyon Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too much of the conservancy's money has gone into politically sexy projects 
and not enough of it has gone into real parks," said Dave Brown, a Calabasas 
city planning commissioner and member of the conservancy's board. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston conceded that the Canyon Oaks purchase essentially depleted the 
conservancy's cash reserves from the last voter-approved infusion of parks 
money, Proposition A. But, he added, the conservancy's mission is to acquire 
property, not to hoard its resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Edmiston said, "It is really premature to sound the death knell" for 
the purchase of Canyon Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Counting on Proposition 180 was not unrealistic, he said, because voters in 
the past have been willing to fund parkland measures. Political consultant Mark 
Litchman, who has worked for the conservancy, said most parks agencies have no 
choice but to rely on voters to stay alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no major sources of private funding for acquisition of open space," 
Litchman said. "It's a long fight, and it's not up or down on one vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it is already a difficult time for the conservancy, which is under fire 
from some of its political overseers in Sacramento over its attempted 
condemnation of Soka University's scenic Calabasas campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy wants Soka's property, at Mulholland Highway and Las Virgenes 
Road, to serve as a visitors center for the Santa Monica Mountains National 
Recreation Area. The school, however, refuses to sell and the two have been 
waging a legal fight that is now under consideration by the California Supreme 
Court. Soka, meanwhile, has lobbied state legislators who oversee the 
conservancy to try to stymie the condemnation proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 There is speculation among parks advocates that the conservancy's recent land 
acquisitions -- Canyon Oaks included -- have had more to do with winning 
political friends than saving open space. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston dismisses such criticism and says the price of Canyon Oaks was 
justified. "An honest evaluation of the resources is going to show that the 
Canyon Oaks property deservedly held the position that it did," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the purchase of Canyon Oaks disturbs many who follow the 
conservancy's actions -- some of them impatient property owners who are still 
waiting for the agency to follow through on purchasing their land. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, the real estate appraisal for Canyon Oaks was prepared in 1992, 
when land values were higher than current prices. Several independent property 
appraisers contacted by The Times said vacant land values in the Santa Monica 
Mountains have dropped significantly in recent years -- perhaps by as much as 
30%. 
</P>
<P>
 The final purchase price of Canyon Oaks was just $300,000 less than the $20.2 
million set by the 1992 appraisal. Because of the rapidity with which the deal 
was closed in March, there was no time to update the appraisal. 
</P>
<P>
 State real estate officials said, however, it might not have made a difference 
because the developer -- a Disney family trust -- probably would not have sold 
at a lower price. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under ideal circumstances you might want a fresh appraisal," said Bob Meier, 
the state's senior real estate officer. "But I suspect the deal never would 
have been done with a lower appraisal. This property was in planning for 16 
years."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CHATSWORTH; PRIZED MILITARY MEMORABILIA A LINK TO THE PAST

<P>
 Bruce Herman's Chatsworth office is a memorial to a time that is no more. 
</P>
<P>
 The 35-year-old building owner, who works out of his home, collects military 
memorabilia ranging from his favorite collection of Prussian generals' helmets 
to a rare drum from the 73rd U.S. Army regiment, an African American unit that 
served in the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 "Honor was such a prized virtue then," Herman said of the Civil War era. "You 
had men fighting to be the color bearer and carry the flag even though the 
chances of being killed were great." 
</P>
<P>
 Herman began his collection at age 10 when his grandfather -- who he describes 
as his best childhood friend -- began taking him to flea markets. His 
grandfather told Herman war stories he'd heard from gunfighters and Civil War 
soldiers he'd known as a child and from his own grandfather, a Prussian 
soldier. 
</P>
<P>
 Herman's ancestry is part of the reason for his love of Prussian memorabilia. 
His great-great-grandfather served in the Franco-Prussian War, fought from 1870 
to 1871. He also graduated first in his blacksmith class and received a pocket 
watch that has been handed down to Herman. 
</P>
<P>
 Herman's collection of Prussian and Bavarian generals' helmets are enclosed in 
a 6-by-6-foot glass case in his office. A mid-19th Century Prussian regimental 
flag with hand-embroidered silver thread serves as a backdrop for the display. 
</P>
<P>
 Herman said he hears about items for sale by word of mouth and by meeting 
collectors at military antique shows. Herman said he searches for items that 
haven't been restored, repainted or repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can go out and buy junk all day long," Herman said. "One of the main 
things to a serious collector is purity." 
</P>
<P>
 Last July, Herman went on a relic hunt at a Revolutionary War camp in central 
New York. Using a metal detector, he found knife blades, belt buckles, a solid 
silver British coin and a 70-caliber musket ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Herman, a self-described frustrated curator, derives great pleasure 
from collecting, he said he also feels an obligation to try to preserve 
history. TERESA ANN WILLIS

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: 5 CSUN PROFESSORS EARN RECOGNITION 
</P>

<P>
 Cal State Northridge has recognized five professors for their outstanding 
teaching abilities, a university spokesman announced this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners, who received $500 each and were honored last month at a breakfast 
reception, are Behzad Bavarian, Brian Castronovo, Donald Hall, Rie Rogers 
Mitchell and Joseph Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 In the annual Distinguished Teaching awards program, any student or faculty 
member may nominate a professor. A faculty committee makes the final 
selections. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to recognize the single most important activity that goes on at 
our campus," said Bruce Erickson, CSUN director of public relations. "Good 
teaching is the reason that the taxpayers put $100 million a year into this 
institution, and that students contribute another $50 million in tuition and 
fees. We want to recognize outstanding teachers in some way. These awards help 
us do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Bavarian teaches industrial engineering courses and serves as faculty adviser 
for CSUN's Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers and director of several 
student projects sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall, assistant professor of English, developed the first gay male literature 
course at CSUN, "Gay Male Voices in British and American Literature." 
</P>
<P>
 Castronovo, an assistant professor of Spanish, is an academic adviser for the 
Equal Opportunity Program of the School of Humanities and a member of the 
California Council of Foreign Language Teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, a professor of educational psychology and counseling, is the 
graduate coordinator and served as department chairwoman for five years. She 
has taught at CSUN for 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, a biology professor, is co-founder and coordinator of the Janus 
program, a new approach to the teaching of science and humanities. The program 
is designed to promote greater understanding between the sciences and 
humanities of each other's disciplines, methods and value systems. KAY HWANGBO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; FORUM TO ADDRESS NEW ISSUES OF AGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More and more middle-aged people are working double duty: raising their own 
families and providing care for their aging parents or other relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed the "Sandwich Generation," these people have a lifestyle that experts 
say will become increasingly common as the average life expectancy in the 
United States continues to increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are living longer and living healthier," said Michael S. Turner, 
director of public relations for the Jewish Home for the Aging. 
</P>
<P>
 To help families understand how to handle the added responsibilities, Jewish 
Home for the Aging is sponsoring the "Sandwich Generation Symposium" on Sunday 
at the Warner Center Hilton in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the challenges is being able to maintain a balance in your life," 
Turner said. "We're hoping the symposium will be a part of a continuing 
education for people to increase their awareness of what they need to do to 
provide care, love and attention to their family, their aging relatives as well 
as themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The symposium will address issues related to aging and to the caretakers of 
the elderly. Topics include dementia, "end of life decisions," how to choose a 
nursing home, and Medi-Cal and other public assistance programs, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors and other health-care workers, advocates for the elderly and legal 
aide workers will make presentations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully we will give people some answers and some understanding," Turner 
said. "Also, just as important, the feeling that they are not alone, that there 
are also other people facing these problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The symposium is free to the public and will run from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. 
Registration begins at 8 a.m. Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) will open the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 After the symposium, the home will hold its second annual Gerontology Awards, 
Turner said. The cost for the luncheon is $35. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce T. Berry, former commissioner for issues regarding aging in the federal 
Department of Health and Human Services, will be the keynote speaker.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Gerontology Awards recognize individuals for professional excellence on a 
national level and encourage the scientific, social, academic and psychological 
inquiry into the field of gerontology and aging," said Leah V. Granof, the

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: GRANADA HILLS; HOSPITAL RECEIVES SPECIAL RECOGNITION

<P>
 A team of specialists at Granada Hills Community Hospital will be honored by 
the Alzheimer's Assn., the first time a San Fernando Valley hospital has 
received the group's special recognition award. 
</P>
<P>
 The award, which was announced Wednesday, will honor the hospital's Center for 
Aging Research and Evaluation (CARE). The ninth annual award will be presented 
at the association's award luncheon Friday in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Braun, executive director of the group's Los Angeles chapter, said the 
hospital's CARE unit is "the key link in providing care for Alzheimer's 
patients and family members in the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 The Alzheimer's Assn., which has 227 chapters nationwide, is the largest 
national voluntary health organization dedicated to researching the causes, 
prevention and cure of the disease. It also provides support to families of 
Alzheimer's victims. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 150,000 people in Los Angeles County suffer from Alzheimer's 
disease, a progressive dementia that ultimately leads to death, association 
leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Granada Hills hospital and its CARE unit also are being recognized, Braun 
said, "for their special efforts in dealing with the care of the elderly in the 
North Valley following the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Jan. 17 Northridge temblor, the CARE team contacted its patients and 
families to determine if they needed assistance and offered emergency referral 
services to all elderly in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The CARE team is made up of two neurologists, a geriatrician, a psychiatrist 
and several nurses and clerical staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Daily services, many of which are free, include initial assessment of dementia 
patients, as well as the CARE Club -- a twice-weekly program featuring social 
interaction and exercise for early-stage patients. Four support groups help 
care-givers cope with their roles. 
</P>
<P>
 The CARE program is seeking patient volunteers for clinical trials with new 
medications in the hopes they will benefit those with Alzheimer's disease. 
Volunteers receive free medical care and evaluation during the program. JEFF

 Starving for some new tunes? 
</P>
<P>
 Pop on down to a Moby Disk Records store with a can of food, and they might 
just have the cure for your auditory pangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Feed the hungry while you feed your ears" is Moby Disks' campaign to combat 
hunger, a two-week food drive ending June 19. The drive works like this: 
music-hungry customers bring in a canned food product, and in return they 
receive a $1 to $5 discount on any CD in the store. The chain has stores in 
Canoga Park and Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 All canned goods collected will be donated to the Los Angeles Regional 
Foodbank, which will in turn distribute the food to charities that feed the 
needy throughout Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hungry are not as glorified as AIDS and earthquakes," said marketing 
director Tracy Brophy. MAKI BECKER

 For Bullock's shoppers, today is the day to see the glass half full. 
</P>
<P>
 The first two of the four floors in the earthquake-battered Bullock's Sherman 
Oaks will reopen today, marking the completion of all structural work to the 
building.The department store is located in the Sherman Oaks Fashion Square, 
14000 Riverside Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The 309,600-square-foot store, with four selling floors, has been closed since 
Jan. 17 because of damage from the 6.8 Northridge earthquake. Repairs included 
replacing interior floors, a new exterior facade, main entrance, lighting and 
building signage. 
</P>
<P>
 Following more repairs, the third floor is expected to reopen July 15 and the 
fourth floor will be reopened mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours for the Sherman Oaks store will be 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through 
Friday; 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Saturday, and 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The store had been operating its women's ready-to-wear and accessories 
business out of the 40,000-square-foot store formally occupied by I. Magnin.

<P>
 A spokeswoman for Macy's West/Bullock's said she has no estimates for repair 
costs. JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SYLMAR; MISSION COLLEGE SITE OF RALLY FOR PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A rally for peace will be held Saturday at Mission College where all those 
attending the event will be asked to sign a personal pledge to "extend my hand 
in peace and friendship to my fellow human being." 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't even have to love your neighbor," said Arthur Stevens, executive 
director of the Harmony Coalition, a sponsor of the festival."Just be a good 
neighbor and we'll start from there." 
</P>
<P>
 The festival will include music, dancing and magic from a variety of cultures 
as well as speakers, including Los Angeles Deputy Police Chief Martin Pomeroy. 
The Martin Luther King Center for Non-Violence and other groups dedicated to 
peace will also participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens founded the Harmony Coalition in December because of the violence 
throughout Los Angeles and the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden, people are killing children," Stevens said. "I formed the 
Harmony Coalition because if we wait for politicians to do something it just 
won't be done. I'm putting it up to the people to take this first step." 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens said he hopes the rally will attract people who are "concerned about 
the moral and social fiber of the world and the lack of spiritual direction in 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers will distribute gold ribbons that can be made into angels, 
symbolizing an intention to truly turn Los Angeles into a "City of Angels." 
Volunteers are needed to help get pledges signed. To help contact the Volunteer 
Center of the San Fernando Valley. Stevens said he is hoping to rekindle the 
spirit of togetherness that has faded since the Northridge earthquake in 
January. To him, the disaster was a wake-up call from God. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was definitely a forewarning that we should all get together," Stevens 
said. "We have to wake up before it's too late." ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; TUTOR PROGRAM HELPS YOUNG MOMS GRADUATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There were plenty of times in the last two years that Araceli Mercado wanted 
to give in to the pressures of raising her son alone and drop her education and 
dreams of going to college and becoming a newscaster. 
</P>
<P>
 But tutors that she met weekly at the El Nido Family Center in Pacoima, would 
not let her give up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say 'I can't go on,' but they would support me," said Mercado, 19, 
beaming as her 3-year-old son, Juan, played at her feet. 
</P>
<P>
 A small celebration was held Wednesday at the El Nido center for Mercado and 
Claudia Venegas, 19, both of Pacoima, who have earned their high school 
diplomas and are graduating next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I found out I was pregnant, that's when I wanted to do this," said 
Venegas, who dropped out of Chatsworth High School to get married. "I wanted to 
do this for him." 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't like school," Venegas added. 
</P>
<P>
 But her attitude toward education has changed, especially because she wanted 
to offer a future for her 1-year-old son, also named Juan. She said she did not 
want to give him a reason to quit school when he is older. 
</P>
<P>
 The tutoring program for teen-age mothers is run with volunteers from the 
National Council of Jewish Women, who meet with the mothers each Wednesday to 
help them graduate through an independent study program with the Los Angeles 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is in need of more volunteer tutors, said Liz Herrera, regional 
program director with El Nido Family Centers. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the third year of the tutoring program, which has helped 89 teen-age 
mothers. Mercado and Venegas are only the second and third to get high school 
diplomas, said Bea Levin, one of the tutors who has been with the program since 
it started. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we first started, these kids didn't even lift up their heads; they 
didn't even talk to each other," Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only has the program helped them to learn, but Levin said she has watched 
as the students grew in self-esteem. Levin and the other tutors also take the 
young women on field trips to museums and cultural opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've opened up their eyes a little bit," Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting a high school diploma has already helped Mercado, who last week 
obtained a full-time job as a cashier at a Target store. She plans to 
eventually attend a community college and perhaps become a television 
newscaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the happiest day of my life," Mercado said. ED BOND

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; GLENDALE'S SCHOOLS FACE BUDGET DEFICIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To maintain its current level of spending in a proposed $115-million 1994-95 
fiscal year budget, the Glendale Unified School District will have to dip into 
its savings. 
</P>
<P>
 For the third consecutive year, the state does not plan to increase the amount 
of funding it gives the district per student. The absence of the cost-of-living 
adjustment in state funds has left the district with a projected 11% deficit in 
the amount it has available for each student. 
</P>
<P>
 The district currently receives about $3,100 from the state for each of the 
district's 28,750 students. The district expects an enrollment growth of about 
395 new students in the 1994-95 school year. The district also will not receive 
additional funds for the new enrollees, forcing officials to spend district 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
 The district receives about 90% of its funding from various state sources. It 
spends a majority of this money on employee salaries and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators are concerned that drawing down the district's $8-million 
savings account to pay for new students will eat up reserves set aside for the 
1995-96 and 1996-97 school years -- leaving the district strapped for cash.  
</P>
<P>
 The district's reserve fund peaked at $10 million in the 1993-94 budget year 
after Board of Education members cut $6 million from the 1992-93 budget in 
preparation for the state's freeze on cost-of-living increases. 
</P>
<P>
 If the state does not increase the amount of money it gives to the district to 
support each student, officials may be forced to cut programs next year and in 
the 1996-97 school year, said district spokesman Vic Pallos.  
</P>
<P>
 "We will be able to maintain our current level of spending per student in the 
1994-95 school year, but if we don't get a cost-of-living adjustment from the 
state there will be program cuts next year," Pallos said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has not cut any programs from the 1994-95 budget proposal but is 
unable to add any either. The proposal includes a 2% wage increase for teachers 
and other district employees over a two-year period.  
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Education reviewed the 1994-95 budget proposal Tuesday. The 
general fund portion of the proposed budget -- about $89 million -- has 
increased slightly over last year's general fund to pay for new classroom 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members are scheduled to give a final vote on the budget June 21.

firefighters extinguished the blaze in 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire caused $50,000 in damage to the building and $20,000 in damage to its 
contents. An investigation into the cause of the blaze is continuing, Collis

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; COUNCIL APPROVES SENIORS COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A small apartment complex for senior citizens that city officials and the 
developer hope will upgrade an aging Jessie Street neighborhood has been 
approved by the San Fernando City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to put an apartment owners association on that block," said Severyn 
Ashkenazy, vice president of Zevco Construction, the local company given the 
right develop the city-owned lot at 222 Jessie St., along with another property 
the company owns in the same block. 
</P>
<P>
 Such an association might improve the neighborhood in the 200 block of Jessie 
Street, which city officials now describe as blighted, Ashkenazy said. Both 
lots are vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 The development agreement gives Zevco the city property plus $381,000 to build 
16 apartment units on the two sites. The apartments must be maintained for at 
least 30 years as affordable housing for senior citizens, who would pay $439 in 
monthly rent. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement was approved unanimously by the City council Monday night, 
despite concerns by Councilwoman Joanne Baltierrez. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we are getting what we should for seniors," said Baltierrez, 
who raised questions about the project's financing and whether the apartments 
would be affordable to senior citizens. She suggested that a nonprofit group 
develop the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Kishita, associate city planner, said the city, which has been trying 
to develop the property for two years, had sought proposals from 17 nonprofit 
groups, but none were submitted. "It's a question of scale," Kishita said, 
explaining that the site is too small for such groups to build a large project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have a quality program there," Councilman Doude Wysbeek said. "I 
don't think we're giving away the store." 
</P>
<P>
 Kishita said the city is hoping that the project will fit into a revival of an 
area near San Fernando Junior High School targeted as a focus neighborhood. 
Under that program, the city makes available low-interest loans and grants to 
improve the image of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus neighborhood program was started 1 1/2 years ago, but was derailed 
by the Northridge earthquake. ED BOND

POLICE RECOVER 8 STOLEN SCHOOL COMPUTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police investigators recovered eight computers stolen from Roscoe Elementary 
School, which was burglarized and vandalized last weekend by a group of four to 
six suspected gang members, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer equipment was recovered Tuesday afternoon from a motor home 
parked at an abandoned North Hollywood residence, said Detective Jay St. John 
of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were called to an undisclosed location by an anonymous tipster, St. 
John said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, a 6-year-old saw four to six young men scale a fence, break a 
window on a metal door and crawl through it to enter the school in the 10700 
block of Strathern Street, St. John said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators suspect the burglary may be the work of a local North Hollywood 
gang that used the house as a gathering spot, St. John said. 
</P>
<P>
 The burglars broke windows and furniture and took about 18 computers, causing 
an estimated $17,000 in damage and property loss, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has 1,000 facilities across the city, with 13,000 buildings, 
Brown said. About 4,000 of the district-operated structures are located in the 
San Fernando Valley, he said.

SEPTEMBER TRIAL EXPECTED IN GIRL'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Attorneys on both sides in the case of Hooman Ashkan Panah, the Woodland Hills 
man who faces the death penalty if convicted of sexually assaulting and 
murdering an 8-year-old Tarzana girl, vowed Wednesday that the case would go to 
trial in September. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case is going to have top priority, given the nature of the charges," 
said Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Sandy Kriegler, who will oversee the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors also said Wednesday they would fight a motion expected to be filed 
by defense attorneys to have the case moved out of the San Fernando Valley 
because of the extensive publicity the case has received. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah, 22, has pleaded not guilty to seven felony charges -- including murder, 
kidnaping and sodomy -- in the Nov. 20 death of Nicole Parker, whose battered 
body was found in Panah's bedroom closet. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first court appearance in Van Nuys since Panah was indicted by a 
grand jury in February, attorneys began laying the groundwork for the extensive 
legal arguments that will likely precede Panah's trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Kriegler set a July 26 date to hear arguments on several motions, including 
the change of venue request. 
</P>
<P>
 When Panah's attorneys raised the issue of moving the trial because Valley 
jurors may have been tainted by media coverage, Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter S. 
Berman responded by asking for a gag order, arguing that much of the publicity 
has been generated by statements made by Panah's defense team. 
</P>
<P>
 Kriegler denied the request and asked attorneys to use discretion when 
discussing the case with reporters, a suggestion that was followed after the 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Robert Sheahen also said he will seek to have certain key 
evidence ruled inadmissible.

MCNALL'S COIN FIRM SETTLES LAWSUIT; COURT: JUDGE RULES THAT SISTERS DIDN'T 
PROVE AUCTION HOUSE FRAUDULENTLY HANDLED THEIR LATE FATHER'S COIN COLLECTION. 
</P>

 The daughters of a Thousand Oaks millionaire on Wednesday settled their legal 
action against a coin auction house co-owned by Bruce McNall, part owner of the 
Los Angeles Kings, after a judge ruled the women failed to prove the company 
defrauded them. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Trompeter Gonzalez and her sister, Janet Trompeter Polachek, sued 
Superior Stamp & Coin Co., which is 51% owned by McNall, in 1992 over its 
handling of their father's coin collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Before dying of cancer, Ed Trompeter, a Westlake Village electronics 
manufacturer, decided to sell his collection, fearing that after his death his 
daughters would not know enough about coins to avoid being swindled. 
</P>
<P>
 Trompeter hired Superior, a company he had done business with for 20 years, to 
sell nearly 400 coins in two separate auctions. The legal battle erupted after 
the first auction, which took in $3.5 million in gross proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
 The women sought $1.5 million in damages against the coin company, which they 
accused of overcharging their father on the sale of some coins, improperly 
keeping proceeds from an auction of some of their father's coins and charging 
them $1 million for a debt the company claimed their father owed. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Daniel A. Curry dismissed the fraud 
allegation against Superior on the grounds that the sisters had failed to 
produce evidence to back up their claim that Superior had agreed to buy back 
$550,000 in coins from their father to wipe out a $1-million debt he owed the 
company, said Frank Revere, an attorney representing Superior. 
</P>
<P>
 Curry, however, found in favor of the sisters that Superior had breached its 
contract with their father by keeping $350,000 in auction proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the judge's ruling, the women chose to settle with Superior and its 
co-owner, Ira Goldberg, also a defendant. McNall, although he owns a majority 
share of the coin company, was not individually named as a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an absolute, total victory," Goldberg said in an interview after the 
hearing. "We're totally vindicated." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg said that "never has there been a whisper of fraud" in his company's 
65-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I fought so vehemently to protect our interest," Goldberg said. 
"This has been a nightmare for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Superior had filed a countersuit against the sisters for canceling an auction 
that Goldberg had arranged, in negotiations with Ed Trompeter before his death, 
to sell the rest of Trompeter's coins. In the countersuit, the company sought 
to recover profits it claimed it would have made had the auction taken place. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement reached Wednesday, just before Superior would have 
presented its case to Judge Curry, no money changed hands and both parties 
agreed to dismiss all claims and lawsuits against each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior also agreed to return seven coins to the women that were being held 
as security for possible damages in Superior's lawsuit against them. Trompeter 
had purchased six of the coins as a set for $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Robert A. Levinson, the sisters' attorney, said that after Curry ruled that no 
fraud was involved, he indicated that the sisters did not have a right to 
cancel the auction.  
</P>
<P>
 "At that point it became a wash," Levinson said. "Therefore the most expedient 
thing at the time would be to go ahead and settle." 
</P>
<P>
 Trompeter Gonzalez said after the hearing Wednesday that she and her sister 
will probably end up selling the rest of the coins to private collectors. 
Goldberg estimated the current value of those coins at more than $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 To date the dispute has cost the two sides $700,000 in legal fees, Revere 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's a shame is that we tried to do this three years ago and they wouldn't 
accept it," Goldberg said.

GUARDIAN ANGELS RETURN TO VALLEY TO FIGHT CRIME 'HOT SPOTS'; VOLUNTEERS: FROM 
THEIR VAN NUYS HEADQUARTERS, 20 MEMBERS ARE READY TO PATROL TWO NIGHTS A WEEK. 
</P>

<P>
 Saying they have been inundated by calls from residents frightened by crime, 
the Guardian Angels on Wednesday returned to the San Fernando Valley, opening a 
local headquarters and launching patrols on Sepulveda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are realizing there is just not going to be a police officer on every 
corner," said Guardian Angels Southern California director Weston Conwell. "The 
budget is just not there and the money is not going to be there." 
</P>
<P>
 Conwell said his private group, which conducts anti-crime patrols by civilian 
volunteers who have no police powers, has received hundreds of requests for 
assistance, especially after the Los Angeles Police Department released studies 
of Valley crime "hot spots." The studies indicated that stretches of Sepulveda 
Boulevard were high crime areas blighted by prostitution, robbery and some 
rapes and assaults, and that other areas were similarly afflicted. 
</P>
<P>
 One call was from G.C. (Brodie) Broderson, a 64-year-old Guardian Angels 
volunteer for 10 years, who offered to help bring the Angels to the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got the whole ball of wax here," Broderson said Wednesday, as he 
prepared to go out on patrol from the group's new Van Nuys headquarters on 
Sepulveda Boulevard near Victory Boulevard with the first handful of recruits. 
"You've got your rapes, homicides, robberies, break-ins, muggings. It all comes 
together in a neat little package, right along Sepulveda Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels set up shop in the Valley once before, in 1982, but pulled out 
three years later to consolidate operations in Hollywood. "We realized that was 
a mistake," Conwell said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the group already has 20 members ready to patrol Valley streets in 
their trademark red berets and white T-shirts emblazoned with the Angels logo. 
He said he hopes to solicit additional local volunteers who know the 
neighborhoods, who could be sent out on patrol after three months training. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, patrols will be limited to two nights a week, with another night set 
aside for training. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Lead Officer Joe Losorelli of the Los Angeles Police Department, who 
organized Sepulveda Boulevard merchants into a crime watch group, was skeptical 
about the Guardian Angels and their intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what they are trying to accomplish. Anything in a problem area 
that will benefit the community is great," Losorelli said. "But I don't know if 
they will. I don't know if they are vigilantes or what." 
</P>
<P>
 Broderson, like Conwell, said residents welcome the group. The Angels, he 
said, are not a bunch of vigilantes as some critics have charged since the New 
York-based group was founded in 1979, but committed volunteers dedicated to 
fighting crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm elated," said Broderson, a retired photographer from Mission Hills. 
"We've got a million or more people in the Valley and no volunteer groups 
except some neighborhood groups that don't seem to be doing too well. 
Otherwise, the prostitutes wouldn't be there anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. James McMurray of the LAPD's Van Nuys Division said police would welcome 
the Guardian Angels as long as they limited their activities to scaring away 
prostitutes, their customers and drug buyers. Confrontations with drug dealers 
or other felons, he warned, could be dangerous.

AROUND THE VALLEY: PUSHING FOR PEACE AFTER A LIFETIME OF MINDING HIS OWN 
BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 If you've never heard of Hugh D. Slocum, you're not alone. A retired printer 
who celebrates his 88th birthday today, he has lived for 60 years in a section 
of Canoga Park that was called Lakeside Park when he moved there 60 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Slocum never was the type to make headlines. For 39 years, he operated print 
shops he owned on Sherman Way and Remmet Avenue, raised two daughters with his 
wife, Alice, and was a faithful soldier for the local Chamber of Commerce and 
Kiwanis Club. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, age and failed eyesight mostly confine him to his hillside 
bungalow, where he spends most of his time listening to the television and 
radio, and thinking.  
</P>
<P>
 And he doesn't like what he hears. 
</P>
<P>
 Every night the evening telecasts serve up a potpourri of rapes, murders and 
assaults. Slocum is particularly pained when he hears about young people whose 
lives are cut short or ruined by the violence that has become frighteningly 
commonplace in our society. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why, after a quiet life of minding his own business, Slocum has 
started a peace initiative that he hopes will snowball into a nationwide 
public-awareness campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Slocum is asking newspapers to print free advertisements that readers could 
clip and paste in their windows. The sample flyer he created reads: 
</P>
<P>
 "Neighbors, meet on a regular basis to encourage and educate the community to: 
Be Somebody. Join the Club. Live and Let Live." 
</P>
<P>
 A visit to Slocum's 1920s-era bungalow is like stepping into a bygone era. A 
red, wooden sign carved with the letters "SLOCUM" greets visitors at the 
entrance to the driveway, near a decorative windmill. 
</P>
<P>
 A station wagon with faux-wood side panels stands before the house, which is 
the color of mint ice cream. Visitors must edge around an old oak that leans 
across the driveway, but continues to sport lush foliage despite its fall from 
majesty. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the tree, Slocum finds it easier to be in a horizontal position these 
days, as he meditates on what an old man can do about society's mounting 
problems.  
</P>
<P>
 He was spurred into action in early 1993 when two students, one at Reseda High 
School and another at Fairfax High School in Los Angeles, were shot and killed 
by other students in separate incidents a scant month apart.  
</P>
<P>
 "The violence was getting too rampant. I just got to thinking, 'What on earth 
can be done to start a movement?' " said Slocum, who wears his striking white 
hair brushed back and was somewhat formally dressed in a peach and gray plaid 
jacket, light blue shirt and gray slacks. Pinned to his lapel was a brown "Live 
and Let Live" button. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can do is sit at home and lie down and think," he said in a quiet, 
slightly quavery voice. "I thought I'd get the ball rolling for other people to 
do more than I could do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So he designed and ordered 5,000 "Live and Let Live" buttons, which he donated 
to the two schools, hoping that students would wear them to spread his message 
of peace and tolerance. He would like to supply each incoming class of every 
high school with a batch of buttons, but he can't afford to do that. That's 
where others -- such as a service club, a philanthropist or a concerned parents 
group -- could help him, he hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 Slocum's dream is that his buttons will eventually be out there encouraging a 
forbearance from murder in every school in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The buttons have had mixed success. 
</P>
<P>
 At Fairfax High School, school officials gave about 200 buttons to teachers to 
give to students as rewards for academic excellence or good behavior. The rest 
have been temporarily misplaced as a result of dislocations due to the 
earthquake, an official said.  
</P>
<P>
 At Reseda High School, students wore the buttons and understood their message, 
Assistant Principal Dimitri Vadetsky said. The administrator said the gift of 
the buttons dovetailed nicely with a program created at the time that 
encouraged students to inform school authorities if they knew of a student 
possessing a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very fine gesture," Vadetsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 Slocum has received positive reactions to his charitable deeds in the past. In 
1991, after he donated buttons with the slogan, "Yearn to Learn," to Canoga 
Park High School, the school awarded him an honorary high school diploma. 
Slocum was forced to drop out of school in the ninth grade to help support his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in South Dakota in 1906, Slocum grew up in the South before moving at age 
16 to Oklahoma, where he worked for the Bartlesville Morning Examiner, 60 miles 
northwest of Tulsa, learning to set type. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving to California in 1930, he opted for commercial printing because of its 
greater creative possibilities, he said. After working for other printers in 
Long Beach, Inglewood and the San Fernando Valley, he opened Slocum Printing in 
Canoga Park in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the greatest regrets of Slocum's life is not completing high school, he 
said, because he sees education as the antidote for many of society's ills, 
including students killing students. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence among young people could be tamed, Slocum feels, if leaders and 
concerned residents could find ways to keep youths in school and make sure they 
have something to look forward to when they get out. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as Hugh Slocum is concerned, one doesn't have to be young, rich or 
powerful to make a difference. An old man thinking on his couch can attack evil 
too.

EVANGELIST CONVICTED ON FEDERAL TAX CHARGES; COURTS: RULING IN MEMPHIS CLEARS 
THE WAY FOR TONY ALAMO TO RETURN TO L.A. TO FACE COUNTS IN ALLEGED BEATING OF 
BOY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Flamboyant evangelist Tony Alamo was convicted on federal tax charges in 
Memphis on Wednesday, clearing the way for him to return to Los Angeles to 
stand trial on charges that he ordered the beating of a young boy at his Saugus 
commune. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing in the Saugus case is scheduled for today in Los Angeles Superior 
Court. Alamo is accused of directing four men via telephone from another 
location to strike 11-year-old Jeremiah Miller 140 times with a large paddle at 
the commune in Mint Canyon in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 A Memphis grand jury indicted Alamo in April of last year on charges of filing 
a false income tax return in 1985 and failing to file tax returns the following 
three years. Federal Court jurors in Memphis found the former country singer 
guilty on all counts Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Alamo faces a maximum penalty of six years in prison and a $550,000 fine, IRS 
spokesman Dan Boone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alamo, whose real name is Bernie Lazar Hoffman, had blamed Satan for his woes 
when he was arrested. But Alamo cannot find a defense for his tax problems in 
the Bible, said Justice Department lawyer Christopher Belcher, who noted in his 
closing arguments that the Bible says Christ was born after Joseph and Mary 
returned to Bethlehem to pay their taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "All Tony Alamo had to do was go to the mail box and drop a return in the 
mail," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alamo's attorney, Jeffrey Dickstein, blamed Alamo's legal troubles on his 
ex-wives, overbearing government agencies and former church members. He said 
Alamo's businesses operated at a loss and Alamo had no income. 
</P>
<P>
 Internal Revenue Service officials claim that Alamo and his wife Susan, who 
died of cancer in 1982, shortchanged the IRS an estimated $10 million in taxes 
on income earned from a variety of businesses, using the tax-exempt Tony and 
Susan Alamo Christian Foundation and later the Music Square Church. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alamos founded the Holy Alamo Christian Church in the 1960s, taking young 
dropouts and drug users off the streets of Hollywood and providing them with 
food, shelter and anti-Catholic religious sermons. 
</P>
<P>
 Their religious following grew to hundreds of members in California, Arkansas 
and Tennessee in the 1970s and 1980s, when communes and church-owned businesses 
staffed with free labor from their followers earned millions of dollars, 
particularly off production of glitzy, rhinestone-studded denim jackets that 
sold in exclusive boutiques for as much as $600 each. 
</P>
<P>
 But with success came allegations of child abuse, labor exploitation and 
luxurious living, and the IRS stripped the Alamo Foundation of its tax-exempt 
status in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal authorities began hunting Alamo as a fugitive after he disappeared in 
1989 as Los Angeles County authorities investigated the alleged beating of the 
Miller boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller was at the center of a custody dispute between his mother, a member of 
Alamo's church, and his father, who had left the church and accused Alamo of 
stealing his family's trucking business. The father and son were later among 
former church members who won a federal court judgment against Alamo in 
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Alamo, who would have been spared from a jail sentence if he pleaded guilty to 
a misdemeanor child abuse charge, has denied any wrongdoing. He faces a 
possible six-year sentence if convicted.

FUND-RAISER FORFEITS CITY LICENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A fund-raising business that has allegedly cashed checks for charities that 
don't exist and real charities that it did not represent has forfeited its city 
license, a Los Angeles official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert D. Burns, general manager of the Los Angeles Social Service Department, 
said Thomas Galambos, president and owner of Valley Fundraisers, failed to 
appeal a March 25 notice of intention to revoke Galambos' license. 
</P>
<P>
 Loss of the license prohibits Galambos from soliciting funds on behalf of any 
charities in the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Galambos nor his attorney, Elliott Kajan, could be reached Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's action against Valley Fundraisers was prompted by a Times' article 
disclosing that the firm cashed dozens of checks made out to well-known 
organizations, such as Easter Seals and March of Dimes, which had not 
authorized the firm to solicit or collect for them. 
</P>
<P>
 According to state records, Valley Fundraisers has taken in more than $2.6 
million over the past four years, and has contracts with three nonprofit 
organizations that allow the firm to keep between 85% and 90% of its revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the article appeared, Burns ordered Galambos to produce all 
the company's financial records for an audit. When Galambos failed to respond 
to that order, Burns said, he began proceedings to revoke his license. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns said Galambos cannot apply for a new license without first submitting 
the firm's books and records. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Fundraisers' headquarters, on Alameda Avenue in Burbank, closed shortly 
after the article in The Times appeared, and the phone was disconnected. 
</P>
<P>
 The Galambos operation also remains under a parallel investigation by the 
state attorney general's office. Deputy Atty. Gen. James Cordi, who is heading 
the state's investigation, declined comment on its progress.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SCHOOL DISTRICT TO APPEAL COURT MANDATE ON 
CLAS TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Antelope Valley Union High School District will appeal a court mandate 
ordering it to give students the controversial CLAS test, school board members 
said Wednesday night after meeting in closed session with their attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you should exhaust your legal process (and) part of the legal process 
is this appeal," said board member Tony Welch prior to the meeting. Welch voted 
with Sue Stokka and board President Billy Pricer to appeal the court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Education planned to return to court today in hopes of 
convincing Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne to issue an order 
requiring the district to give the test regardless of whether it appeals her 
initial order. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Education sued the Antelope Valley district last month 
following a decision April 20 by the board's conservative majority not to 
administer the California Learning Assessment System test. At a hearing Monday, 
Wayne issued the tentative ruling ordering the district to give the test. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's appeal would stay Wayne's decision, potentially allowing the 
district to avoid giving the test before the school year ends Wednesday. Even 
if Wayne issues a new order today, the district will go ahead with the appeal, 
Pricer said. The district, however, would have to give the test Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members Bill Olenick and Wilda Andrejcik, have remained steadfast in 
their support of the test, voting against the board majority's decision 
Wednesday to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "My position hasn't changed on the quality of the test and the clarity of the 
law," Olenick said before the meeting. "It's a good test and we should give 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Olenick conceded, however, that with only a few instructional days left before 
the school year ends and all the publicity about the CLAS test, it would be 
difficult to get valid results from district students. 
</P>
<P>
 "The integrity of the test has been junked for the year," he said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 200 GATHER TO MOURN GIRL WHO WAS KILLED IN 
3-VEHICLE COLLISION; FUNERAL: FAMILY AND FRIENDS REMEMBER GENA WATKINSON'S MANY 
ACTIVITIES AND ENERGETIC SPIRIT.

 Gena Watkinson, 15 at the time of her death last week, was remembered by her 
family and friends Wednesday for her love of horses, her singing, poetry, 
competitive swimming and many other activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was one of those people whose energy you would have liked to taken and 
bottled up and sold it, or kept it for yourself, because she had so much," said 
Ralph Milliken, associate and youth pastor of Canyon Country Assembly of God 
Church, who presided over the teen-ager's graveside service. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canyon High School freshman died about two hours after a three-vehicle 
accident last Wednesday night on Seco Canyon Road that killed three and 
seriously injured two others. She was buried at Eternal Valley Memorial Park on 
the same hillside as her friend, JoKema Du Bois, 15, who was driving the car 
when it veered out of control into two on-coming vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesica Noell, 3, will be buried in a private ceremony today. 
</P>
<P>
 Two 14-year-old girls in the car, Alicia Acevedo and Du Bois' sister, Barbara, 
remain hospitalized. The occupants of the other vehicles were not seriously 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Watkinson's grandfather and guardian, John, said Gena was scared enough to run 
from her bedroom into her grandparents' bed during an aftershock a few weeks 
ago, but spirited enough to laugh about it. He said he wished he could have 
provided her similar comfort after the accident, but she died before her family 
could see her. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't able to comfort her in her final moments," he said, "but I'm sure 
she knew she was loved." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 people attended Watkinson's funeral, including dozens of youths 
who attended the service for Du Bois on Tuesday. Many seemed at a loss for 
words to describe the impact of the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in shock," said Natalie Vannah, 17, a Canyon High student. "I didn't 
believe it at first. I still don't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those attending the funeral sang along to two of Watkinson's favorite 
gospel songs, "More Love, More Power" and "I Believe in Jesus," which were 
performed by church youth group leaders Dennis DeFusco and Carnetta Jones. 
Watkinson's family also played taped excerpts from the soundtracks of "Cats" 
and "Phantom of the Opera," her favorite musicals. 
</P>
<P>
 A picture of Watkinson with her horse, Murphy, was on a stand next to the 
casket, along with a few of the numerous ribbons she won in riding 
competitions. Debbie Strieter, a rider who had known Watkinson for several 
years, said the teen-ager's persistence was extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year she had an accident, a bad one, when she fell off her horse," 
Strieter said. "She came back right away (after medical treatment) and got 
right back on. This is when she had stitches in her head." 
</P>
<P>
 An annual award for the "most tenacious rider" will be presented in 
Watkinson's name to future riders of the High Desert Horseman's Assn., of which 
she was a member, said Mark Storms, one of the organization's trainers. 
</P>
<P>
 Watkinson was also a member of the Canyon High junior varsity swim team, and 
sang in her church and school choirs, according to family members. She also 
wrote poetry, and her poem "Never Ending" was read at the service, with 
Milliken urging those in attendance to take the words to heart. 
</P>
<P>
 One line reads: "In the end, something good will happen from this change, even 
if the change is bad."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; FARES COULD INCREASE FOR BUS SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Using public transportation in and around the Antelope Valley may soon be 
slightly more costly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley Transit Authority is considering raising its fare on local 
routes from 75 cents to 80 cents. A public hearing on the proposed rate 
increase is slated for July 25, although transit officials do not expect much 
protest because the rate hikes are so minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the controversy that has erupted since the Los Angeles County 
Metropolitan Transit Authority proposed raising its fares to make up for six 
years without increases, Bill Budlong, AVTA executive director, said he 
believes it's better to impose small increases on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurt Mills, AVTA administrative analyst, said, "We want to do rate hikes that 
are on a timely basis. There's been other transportation agencies that have 
waited years and to catch up with their costs the rate hikes have been real 
dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going from 75 to 80 cents is nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Other rates would also increase slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Reduced fares for elderly and disabled riders on the local buses are slated to 
go from 35 cents to 40 cents. Monthly passes for the general public would 
increase $1 to $21, although those for seniors and the disabled will remain the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
 The transit agency is proposing no change for its door-to-door Dial-a-Ride 
service for seniors and the disabled, and for its medical shuttle that 
transports residents to major hospitals and medical centers in the Los Angeles 
basin. 
</P>
<P>
 AVTA commuter fares to Downtown Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley would 
increase $1, to $7 and $6, respectively. A 20-ride pass on the downtown line 
will go up $5, to $105 and a 44-ride pass to the San Fernando Valley would go 
up $5, to $125. Monthly passes for seniors and the disabled would not rise. 
</P>
<P>
 AVTA is not proposing any changes to the fares on its Van Nuys or Century City 
commuter lines, which were initiated with federal funds after the Jan. 17 
Northridge quake crippled Southern California freeways.

JIM MURRAY: IT'S A (BIG) MAN'S WORLD IN NBA, THANK GOODNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that the NBA finals pit the Houston Rockets against the New York Knicks, I 
find myself content. Order has been restored to professional basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 It's always nice to have one's conceits verified, opinions validated, and my 
long-held and stubbornly defended conviction was that basketball today belonged 
to the big man in the pivot. 
</P>
<P>
 My position, previously unshakable, had nevertheless been rocked somewhat in 
recent years. Blame Isiah Thomas, Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley. And to an 
extent, Larry Bird. 
</P>
<P>
 You see, when most of us came upon the professional game, it was dominated by, 
not to say overwhelmed by, two men in the pivot, Bill Russell and Wilt 
Chamberlain. They met, more or less annually in the championship game -- or the 
game that decided the championship whether it was the final or not. Russell 
usually won. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Russell came into those games with the likes of Bob Cousy, Bill 
Sharman, K.C. Jones or Sam Jones surrounding him. Not to say Jim Loscutoff or 
Tom Heinsohn or Tom Sanders. But Chamberlain came in with the likes of Paul 
Arizin, Guy Rodgers, Tom Gola and Al Attles. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in earlier incarnations, the game had been the property of the mighty 
George Mikan, who used to set up housekeeping in the key in the days before 
three seconds were all you were allowed there at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 It was easy to pick the champion. Go with the team that had the biggest and 
most successful center. No sub-seven-footers need apply. Everybody else out 
there was the chorus line. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, the big guys needed some help. But not much. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of the coin, you had some brilliant all-time talents who 
could never crack the title ranks. Until they got behind a dominant center. 
Jerry West before Chamberlain comes to mind. Oscar Robertson before Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
 You just didn't win the championship with what came to be known as "point 
guards" or "power forwards." Portland won when it got Bill Walton. The Lakers 
got Abdul-Jabbar (and he got Magic Johnson, whom he needed as much as he had 
needed Oscar Robertson). 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to tell when the pendulum started to swing. Maybe with the 1974-75 
Rick Barry Warriors. The 1977-78 Washington Bullets: What they were doing with 
the title was baffling -- an over-aged, under-sized Wes Unseld in the pivot. 
But they had Elvin Hayes pulling down 1,000 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seattle SuperSonics won with mirrors in 1978-79. But when the Lakers got 
Magic, it was all Abdul-Jabbar again. 
</P>
<P>
 The revolution began in earnest in 1986-87 when the Detroit Pistons, who 
boasted Isiah Thomas and not much else, barely missed eliminating the Boston 
Celtics and reaching the finals. The next year, they reached the finals -- but 
came up a basket short against the Lakers in the title game. 
</P>
<P>
 The next year and the next after that, the Pistons threw everybody's 
calculations out the window when they won championships with the likes of Bill 
Laimbeer and James Edwards at center. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the next three years after that, the game belonged to a 6-foot-6 guard 
out of North Carolina -- fellow by the name of Michael (Don't Call Me Mike) 
Jordan, who played a game several feet above the rest of the league and had 
once referred to his teammates (accurately if impoliticly) as "my supporting 
cast." His centers, Bill Cartwright and Will Perdue, were not even that. 
</P>
<P>
 The Era of the Big Man seemed completely over. Scouts scoured the bushes for 
pony-sized players who could handle the ball, run an offense and, it was hoped, 
play the kind of game where they could sell advertising on the soles of their 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to let go of your hard-won prejudices, so for those of us who had 
accepted it as Holy Writ that you won championships only with the superior 
seven-footers in the pivot, the Thomases and the Jordans had become an acute 
embarrassment. Titles, in our winter books, were to be won in this league by 
(a) Patrick Ewing, (b) Hakeem Olajuwon, (c) David Robinson or (d) Shaquille 
O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
 It's reassuring that it's Olajuwon and Ewing. Not a forward such as Karl 
Malone, a guard such as Reggie Miller or even a Jordan-heir such as Scottie 
Pippen. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston doesn't square off against New York, Olajuwon squares off against 
Ewing. On the surface, it's a replay of the old Chamberlain-Russell matchups -- 
the Terminator (Olajuwon) against the Intimidator (Ewing). 
</P>
<P>
 It's nice to know some things never change. They simply take a while to come 
full circle. It's nice to be able to say, "I told you so!" again. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure glad Michael Jordan thought he could hit the curveball.

WORLD CUP '94: DAYS AND COUNTING; '90 NIGHTMARE; LAST WORLD CUP PART OF NETWORK 
OF CORRUPTION THAT LEFT ITALY REELING AND CHANGED IT FOREVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was scandalous, people said, when Italy failed to reach the finals in the 
World Cup it staged four summers ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Little did they know. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are still chasing billions of lire that inexplicably fell off 
trucks en route to Italia 90. Cell doors will be closing for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 No one disputes the smooth operation of the tournament itself, any more than 
there is anything beyond lingering chagrin over Italy's heartbreaking semifinal 
loss to Argentina on penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 But all of Italy bears a grudge against the cozy cabal of big-shot politicians 
and businessmen who looted their country in the name of world soccer as part of 
a nationwide network of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Italian soccer is different on the field today in part because of the 
Italia 90 results, so, too, is Italy a different country politically in its 
aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way in which Italian parties and cities approached the Mondiale was the 
last example of a bad way to approach public business," said Luca di 
Montezemolo, who headed the Italia 90 organizing committee. "It was the last 
example of behavior that I hope is completely finished in Italy." 
</P>
<P>
 Montezemolo, 46, president of the auto maker Ferrari, spent four years 
arranging Italy's role as host for the tournament as head of the private 
organizing committee. In 12 cities across Italy, on the peninsula and in the 
islands of Sardinia and Sicily, the 52-game championship unfolded seamlessly. 
</P>
<P>
 Underlying the sport was massive infrastructural overhaul: telephone lines, 
television satellite links, roads, rail lines and stations, two new stadiums 
and exorbitant face lifts for the others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall it was a good thing," Montezemolo said. "We have modern, safe 
stadiums, roads, an improved airport in Rome. More was accomplished around the 
event than in the previous 10 years. Unfortunately, Italy is a place where it 
is difficult to get things done if there is no pressure. Earthquakes, a World 
Cup, the Olympic Games, they make things happen. Events proved a good excuse to 
do things that wouldn't be done without them."  
</P>
<P>
 A month before the Cup began, all of Italy was a construction site. Nothing 
was ready; people despaired. Speaking with a Times reporter four weeks before 
the opening game, Montezemolo was asked if Italy would embarrass itself before 
the world: "I don't know," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare for games that were seen as priceless international advertising for 
Italy, the national and local governments contracted big Italian companies for 
needed and ambitious public works budgeted at about $4 billion. They wound up 
paying much more. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason, it turned out later, was that there were so many greedy fingers in 
the pie. Rome's Olympic Stadium, site of the final, cost almost three times 
more to enlarge and improve than the original estimate. Milan's San Siro 
Stadium and Naples' San Paolo are among the targets of corruption probes. Also 
being investigated are circumstances surrounding the construction of 
multimillion-dollar white elephant train stations in Rome built for the Cup but 
now abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would never do it again," Montezemolo said. "They were four terrible years, 
always fighting with people, trying to explain that our committee had nothing 
to do with the infrastructure. It was good to modernize, but not the cost." 
</P>
<P>
 About 18 months after Italia 90, magistrates in Milan began unraveling what 
has become the biggest scandal in Italian history: The World Cup was just one 
savory dish on a banquet table of corruption in which businesses paid off 
political parties and individuals in exchange for government contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Popular revulsion triggered a revolt at the polls earlier this year: Italy's 
political establishment oversaw Italia 90 with well-fed smiles, but now the 
avuncular men and parties that ruled for more than four decades are in 
disgrace. More than 3,000 politicians and businessmen are implicated in probes 
of massive corruption in which soccer was only a modest sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 March elections brought to power right-wing parties promising clean government 
and led by billionaire media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi, a soccer fanatic whose 
holdings include champion AC Milan. "Today, with a different government, things 
could be different," Montezemolo said. "We might be able to do the same with a 
different moral ethic." 
</P>
<P>
 If Italy is a sadder but wiser place four years later, its national soccer 
team is also poorer, in the eyes of most of its fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italian team, which will play a final tuneup match against Costa Rica on 
Saturday at New Haven, Conn., flew to the United States Tuesday as 70% of 
callers were telling one national sports daily that they had no confidence in 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1992 housecleaning swept out many Italia 90 players, including high-scoring 
striker Salvatore Schillaci, as well as coach Azeglio Vicini, who was replaced 
by Arrigo Sacchi, winner of every title in sight at AC Milan. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacchi demands more exciting soccer than the traditional Italian catenaccio -- 
pass-to-pass in a long chain. Sacchi looks for a more open game with more room 
for offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven or eight years ago, Italy played man-to-man defense. Today, the Azzurri, 
like many first division clubs, plays a zone defense, according to Giorgio 
Tutino, a Rome sportswriter who has covered Italian soccer for three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "Italy used to play a long game, with key forwards and two or three defenders 
always back. That's a recipe for 0-0, 1-0. Now Italy plays short -- lots of 
attackers, lots of defenders," Tutino said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble is, Italy hasn't looked good in Cup warm-ups. It beat Switzerland, 
1-0, in Rome last week, but the Swiss played better.  
</P>
<P>
 There are a lot of Italian nerves riding on their World Cup opener on June 18 
against Ireland at East Rutherford, N.J. Some of them belong to Luca di 
Montezemolo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to decide whether to go to the Ireland game," said Montezemolo, 
who is vice president of third-division Bologna, a former first-division 
powerhouse trying to claw back up the ladder. 
</P>
<P>
 He's been watching preparations for the Cup as a fan -- and, deja vu, as a 
survivor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Americans have many advantages," Montezemolo said. "The mentality is 
different in the United States; there is a great willingness to volunteer; the 
pressure is also less because soccer is not as popular. Then, too, nobody 
expects huge new things from the United States; the country is already 
well-organized. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the Americans have disadvantages: Because the distances are huge; because 
I don't think people will be as totally involved as in Italy. And because it is 
easy to make mistakes in something of this size."

WORLD CUP '94: DAYS AND COUNTING; TICKET COMPLAINTS LEAD TO CLASS-ACTION 
LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Disgruntled World Cup ticket-holders in Chicago have filed a class-action 
lawsuit in an effort to resolve what they say are massive ticket problems. 
Soccer fans throughout the country have been reporting ticket snafus ranging 
from getting incorrect seats to being issued seats in the wrong city. 
</P>
<P>
 The civil complaint, filed in Cook County Circuit Court on Tuesday, charges 
consumer fraud, deceptive practices and breach of contract. The named 
complainant is Anton Naunheimer of Chicago, but his attorney, Stephen Diamond, 
said the case represents about 5,000 ticket-holders in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond said he will amend the complaint today to seek an expedited hearing of 
the case before circuit judge Lester Foreman. 
</P>
<P>
 During a conference call with reporters Wednesday, World Cup '94 Chairman Alan 
Rothenberg again downplayed the extent of the ticket problems and gave the 
number of a World Cup public information hot line. That number is (310) 
277-9494. He said he was aware of the lawsuit but had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg also said all first- and second-round tickets were expected to be 
delivered by Friday -- rather than Tuesday or Wednesday of this week, as had 
been promised earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond said Naunheimer paid for Category I tickets, which the World Cup 
advertised as being between the end lines. His seats at Soldier Field are 
behind the goal, Diamond said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's in the North end zone and he can see the goalie on his side," Diamond 
said. "Beyond that, it's a wish and prayer." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit charges that World Cup organizers reconfigured the seating plan in 
the stadiums to allow for more high-priced Category I seats. Consequently, the 
best seats began to curve around the corners of the stadiums and encroach into 
the end zones. "It's not a tough case," Diamond said. "Either they lied to us 
or they didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite reports of massive complaints by fans, World Cup officials maintain 
that the problems concern less than one-half of 1% of the 3 million tickets 
issued. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg said he expected all problems to be resolved before the World Cup 
opens on June 17. How they would be resolved, he didn't say. Ticket industry 
experts say it is standard procedure in a large event to hold back 2% of the 
available tickets to deal with such unforeseen problems as broken seats and 
obstructed views. Rothenberg said seats had been withheld at all nine venues, 
but would not say how many. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, fans who have problems with tickets to the games at the Rose 
Bowl are still clogging World Cup office telephones. Paul Levine of Mar Vista 
said he took out an ad to find other disgruntled soccer fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "My reaction (to the class-action suit) is I absolutely want to be involved in 
it or else I'm planning to take them to small claims court," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine said he requested Category I tickets as part of the "soccer family" 
sale and received Category II tickets. But even those seats are not where they 
were promised, but in the end zone with the worst seats, Category III. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a friend flying from Switzerland just for this," Levine said. "He took 
off work. His trust in me is going to be really bad from now on. I'm really 
upset about it. They are making hundreds of thousands of dollars on just 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing. I'll never be able to see another World 
Cup. I grew up with soccer and I can tell you, you can't see anything from 
behind the goal, you can't see the other end of the field."

SCYPHERS ACTED WITHIN THE LAW; BASEBALL: SUSPENDED SIMI VALLEY HIGH COACH WILL 
NOT BE PROSECUTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED and JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Suspended high school baseball Coach Mike Scyphers broke no laws and will not 
be prosecuted for allegations that he mishandled his team's money and 
discipline, the Ventura County District Attorney's office said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were numerous allegations involving alleged criminal conduct regarding 
the coach, but most were found to be unfounded," Ventura County Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Donald M. Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no evidence that Scyphers, who brought the Simi Valley baseball 
program to national prominence during his 16 years as coach, broke California 
law by allowing players to paddle other players for violating team rules, Grant 
said. Scyphers' handling of a $700 field rental fee was found not to be 
illegal, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers said Wednesday he is glad to be exonerated, but is bitter because the 
criminal probe besmirched his reputation and the suspension cut short his 
coaching season. He also said he has had difficulty sleeping and has lost 15 
pounds since the suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't get my reputation back," Scyphers said. "I can't get those seven 
games back. It's the old guilty-until-proven-innocent." 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers, 41, was suspended from coaching May 3 after the police began an 
investigation into the alleged financial and disciplinary improprieties. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just goes to show how a person . . . can accuse somebody and turn his life 
and his family's upside down for a month," he said. "There's something wrong 
with that, how a person can be stopped from doing what he loves while there's 
an investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Another investigation of Scyphers continues within the Simi Valley Unified 
School District, however, and officials still could decide against renewing 
Scyphers' annual coaching contract, said Doug Crosse, a member of the district 
school board. 
</P>
<P>
 The board can lift his administrative leave from coaching, Crosse said, but 
Scyphers still must be rehired next fall by Simi Valley High Principal Kathryn 
Scroggin. Scyphers is a full-time teacher at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly respect the district attorney's investigation, and it's good news 
that there have been no improprieties to the extent that there would be an 
arrest or criminal prosecution," Crosse said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scroggin declined to comment on the decision not to prosecute. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley police Lt. Mark Layhew said the case "was submitted for review, 
with no recommendation for filing or rejection." 
</P>
<P>
 Schools superintendent Mary Beth Wolford declined to comment on the 
prosecutor's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have an internal personnel matter, and we are waiting for the report 
from the district attorney's office," Wolford said. "We want to finish our 
investigation. It's really not appropriate for me to discuss any discipline at 
this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolford plans to meet Friday morning with the players' parents, who have 
supported Scyphers. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, some of them blasted the school district for sending the popular 
coach through such a public and fruitless criminal probe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was clear from the little information that was shared with us that there 
was nothing of a criminal nature," said Maureen Celusta, mother of senior 
pitcher Nathan Celusta. "I blame the school administration absolutely in total 
for ruining my son's senior year baseball experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Grant, the prosecutor, said he reviewed numerous allegations against Scyphers, 
but found only two worth considering for criminal charges. Ultimately, he 
rejected both. 
</P>
<P>
 The paddling of players that Scyphers allowed in a practice ritual known as 
"the block" might violate state educational codes forbidding corporal 
punishment, but it is not against the law, Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't violate simple battery laws because the striking was done with the 
consent of the students," Grant said. Nor did the paddling violate other 
assault laws, he said, because it produced no unjustifiable pain or mental 
suffering and was not cruel or inhuman punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant also said Scyphers might have acted improperly by cashing a $700 check 
for a field rental fee from the National Adult Baseball Assn. and distributing 
it to his assistant coaches. But there was no evidence Scyphers profited from 
it in any way, Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
 The distribution of money to assistant coaches without school knowledge 
violates Southern Section rules. 
</P>
<P>
 There were hints of improprieties found in a school district-commissioned 
audit of the high school's Allied Student Body funds and the Youth Baseball 
Trust Fund, Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the audit, they found evidence of internal conflicts of interest involving 
Scyphers, lack of internal controls (of money) and questionable activity," he 
said. "But they didn't find any criminal activity. . . . In a case like this 
when you have to present it to a jury, you're looking for strong evidence of 
criminal activity." 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers also has filed a grievance against the school district, claiming the 
district violated the teachers' collective-bargaining agreement by suspending 
him without five days' notice. The district has maintained that Scyphers was 
not entitled to notice because he was suspended only from coaching, not 
teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian O'Neill, Scyphers' attorney, criticized the district for taking the case 
to the police. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is clear to me, from looking at this thing with some sort of hindsight, 
that there is some sort of agenda out there to clear out the athletic 
department," O'Neill said. "I think that Dr. Scroggin referring what is 
apparently an employer-employee dispute to a prosecuting agency is 
inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the friction with the school district, Scyphers said, he wants to 
return as coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a game I've put so much into and I'm not going to have people tell me 
when they want me to get out," he said. "I want to get out on my own terms and 
when I'm darn good and ready to get out. 
</P>
<P>
 "As of now I feel like I owe the parents a tremendous amount for what they've 
given me. A lot of them have kids coming back next year and I want to thank 
those parents."

HARRIS SAYS HE WILL KEEP LAKERS' STAFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New Laker Coach Del Harris said Wednesday that he will retain assistants Bill 
Bertka, Michael Cooper and Larry Drew on the staff for next season. 
</P>
<P>
 All worked for former coach Magic Johnson, and Bertka and Drew were on the 
staff of Randy Pfund, who was fired last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Bertka will enter his 14th season as a Laker assistant and has 22 seasons as 
an assistant in the NBA. No active assistant has been around longer in that 
role. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper joined the staff when Johnson was named to replace Pfund. 
</P>
<P>
 Drew spent 10 seasons as an NBA player and has two seasons as an assistant 
coach.

USC BACKUP QUARTERBACK INELIGIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 USC quarterback Kyle Wachholtz has been declared academically ineligible for 
the 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
 He would have again been a junior backup to senior Rob Johnson.A 6-foot-5, 
220-pound player from Corona, Wachholtz has played sporadically the last two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 In Seattle two seasons ago, Wachholtz entered a game USC trailed, 17-10, in 
the fourth quarter, after Johnson was injured and Reggie Perry was ineffective. 
In his first game since high school, he completed three of six passes for 31 
yards and moved the Trojans to Washington's 28 before an interception ended the 
last USC threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing behind Johnson again in 1993, Wachholtz completed 17 of 25 passes in 
six appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Coach John Robinson called Wachholtz the Trojans' "certain 
starter" for 1995, but that was before Brad Otton transferred to USC from Weber 
State. Otton will be a sophomore behind Johnson this season, as will another 
reserve, Matt Koffler. EARL GUSTKEY

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; AS USUAL, NOTHING WILL BE EASY FOR KNICKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is the Gulf Coast of Texas, where the humidity hovers near 100 on 
Christmas Day and you have to push the air out of the way if you want to go 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
 A breeze? Aside from the occasional hurricane, there hasn't been a breeze here 
since dinosaurs roamed the earth. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Knicks opened the NBA finals here Wednesday night. No breezes 
there either, even if the West has nothing better to offer than those 
perpetually reforming screw-ups, the Rockets. John Starks said the pressure was 
off after two seven-game series, but he learned the truth when the Knicks fell 
in one of those NBA pitchers' duels, 85-78, and the only breezes came from his 
airballs. 
</P>
<P>
 Starks went three for 18. Derek Harper went three for 10. Greg Anthony was 
three for seven, Hubert Davis one for six, for a grand total of 10 for 41. If 
the Knicks hope to keep the Rockets from packing it back in on Patrick Ewing, 
they're going to have to find some shooters -- and the trading deadline has 
passed. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you come this far and you work this hard," Knick Coach Pat Riley said, 
"I don't care what it's about, you've got to make shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had the ability to win this game if we made shots. I think that's the 
universal disease and the perception people have of us . . . but when they give 
us those shots, we've got to make them." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, his players have been bricking them up all season. 
</P>
<P>
 They were surely tired, too, after going to Game 7s against the Chicago Bulls 
and the Indiana Pacers. The Knicks like to think they've become so tough there 
isn't any obstacle they can't overcome, but all they really did was advance 
over two teams they were expected to beat easily, rather than duel to the 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Riley doesn't want them even thinking about fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is no time to be tired," he said. "We played two seven-game series, but 
that's no excuse this time of year. There are no excuses this time of year. 
That ring should create enough adrenaline to get you past that." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the Knicks parroted him. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you saying," Harper said, "that we were tired? 
</P>
<P>
 "Nah, You don't play the kind of defense we played in the fourth quarter if 
you're tired." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe if you're tired, you start off well and then just fade away. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks shot 10 for 22 in the first quarter, nine for 19 in the second . . 
. then six for 26 in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 They started the fourth quarter with a one-for-nine run, making them seven for 
their last 35. Thus it shouldn't have come as a surprise that the Rockets, who 
had their own problems -- they were too rested, they said -- were 12 points up. 
</P>
<P>
 But then came the fourth quarter, which, in Houston, is the same thing as the 
bewitching hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the Phoenix Suns stormed back from 18- and 20-point deficits in 
back-to-back games in their second-round series, the Rockets have been hearing 
footsteps. Wednesday the crowd began stirring when the Knicks cut their 77-65 
lead to 77-69. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets responded by, uh, not playing very well under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks closed to 79-76 before going into their own Keystone Kops routine. 
Starks shot an airball from the three-point line. Under pressure, Anthony 
bounced an entry pass out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Kenny Smith, winner of the nightly Rudy Tomjanovich lottery to see if 
he has a point guard capable of finishing the game, got inside the Knick 
defense and passed to Otis Thorpe, who was so near the basket, he didn't have 
to chance a shot and embarrass them all further. He dunked. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the Rockets' only basket in the last 8:53 -- and one of their two in 
the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made that many?" Tomjanovich deadpanned later. 
</P>
<P>
 Starks, having just learned that the playoffs get harder as you advance, not 
easier, didn't compound his mistakes by saying anything else. The Knicks 
stationed a public-relations assistant between him and reporters to announce 
John would not be commenting on anything. 
</P>
<P>
 The assistant didn't say if Riley had stationed him there, but it would have 
been a good thought.

STANLEY CUP FINALS; RANGER TITLE WOULD MAKE ONE MOM PROUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Margaret Cater's name won't be engraved on the Stanley Cup if the New York 
Rangers win the NHL championship, but maybe it should be. 
</P>
<P>
 If not for Cater's interest in hockey, her son, Neil Smith, wouldn't have had 
anyone to shoot pucks at in their driveway as a child. And if not for that, 
Smith might not have grown up to become general manager of the Rangers, who can 
win their first Cup since 1940 with a victory over the Vancouver Canucks 
tonight at Madison Square Garden. The Rangers take a 3-1 lead into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's how I got involved in hockey," Smith said. "She's the reason I'm here 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith carries in his wallet a black-and-white picture of his mother taken in 
1937, when she played for the Winnipeg Olympics of the Canadian Ladies Hockey 
League. Shades of "A League of Their Own," except on skates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The joke about it is that the uniform was the same colors as Ranger colors -- 
red, white and blue," Cater said from her home near Toronto. "Isn't that 
funny?" 
</P>
<P>
 Cater, in her mid-70s, played defense in the ladies' league for three years, 
until World War II shut it down.  
</P>
<P>
 "I played hockey with the boys from the time I could remember," she said. "I 
loved it. I still love to watch it. Although today, with hockey, if they don't 
stop that hooking and holding and (neutral zone) trap it's going to be boring 
and they're going to lose fans. They've allowed hooking and holding and 
interference to go beyond a certain point. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to see bodychecking thrown out. But they have to remember sports 
are entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
 Cater was a dancer when she met Smith's father, a professional musician. He 
died when Neil was 10, and she enrolled her son in youth hockey programs to 
ensure that he had male companionship in a family that consisted of her, her 
mother and Neil's older sister, Patricia. 
</P>
<P>
 "He started playing for Civitans (a local club) when he was 9, which was late 
really to start skating," she said. "I had taken him out to teach him how to 
skate. That summer, his dad died, and I was left to take him where he wanted to 
go. I was always there and I kept going because if something happened to him, I 
didn't want to find out from someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard because it wasn't like today, when there are so many single 
parents. I stuck out like a sore thumb." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, 40, remembers his mother's guidance fondly. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wasn't a stage mom," he said. "I remember that I wanted to play road 
hockey, and she'd tell me to put on my skates because that was going to do me 
more good. She'd say, 'Don't waste your time having fun. You should always do 
something that will improve yourself.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Smith improved enough to win a scholarship to Western Michigan. He had a 
tryout with the New York Islanders, but never made it to the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 His hockey dreams didn't end there. Smith took a job in New York with a 
company that sold purse mirrors and began to scout Ranger games voluntarily for 
the Islanders. Cater wasn't sure where that would lead, but she supported him. 
</P>
<P>
 "One time, he phoned me and said, 'Mom, I don't think I'm staying here, I 
don't care how much money I can make,' " said Cater, who remarried after Neil 
left home. "I told him, 'Neil, if you leave New York, I don't want to hear, 
"What if?" If you don't make it, you can always come home.' He always loved New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the boys of his generation had no goals. My daughter had a goal, to 
become a schoolteacher, and that's what she is. Neil had a goal, to be a 
general manager." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was hired by the Islanders as a full-time scout and left in 1982 to 
become assistant general manager of the Detroit Red Wings. He succeeded Phil 
Esposito in New York. Since then, through excellent drafts and trades, he has 
built the Rangers into a two-time winner of the President's Trophy as the NHL's 
top team and taken them within one more victory of the Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Cater has been behind him all the way. Using the fax machine he bought her, 
she sends him clippings from Toronto newspapers and other hockey publications. 
She also keeps him posted on what's being said on Toronto's all-sports radio 
station and New York's all-sports station, which she tunes in late at night 
when it can be picked up in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 She's also not shy about giving her own opinion, sometimes calling him between 
periods of games. 
</P>
<P>
 Like any good son, Smith listens to Mom. "She knows as much or more than 
anybody here," he said. "She goes all the way back to Babe Pratt (a star of the 
1930s and '40s) and all those people." 
</P>
<P>
 Cater was in New York for the Rangers' semifinal series against the New Jersey 
Devils but went home when her husband, Jim, became ill. She's not sure if she 
will be in New York tonight, but there's no question which team she's rooting 
for. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly hope the Rangers win, and not just because it's my son. it's 
because they have the better team," she said. "And it would be kind of nice for 
me not to hear that 1940 business. I'm sure the fellows on the team can't stand 
it, either." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers, who returned from Vancouver Wednesday afternoon, were calmly 
preparing for tonight's possible clincher. "We feel comfortable and confident 
at home," center Mark Messier said. "We're just going to continue to do what 
we've done all through the playoffs and not look further beyond the first 20 
minutes (tonight). . . . Now is not the time to be looking too far ahead. We're 
not going to fall into that trap." 
</P>
<P>
 Two convincing Ranger victories at the Pacific Coliseum left the Canucks 
facing a deficit only the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs have overcome in the finals. 
The Canucks erased a 3-1 Calgary lead in the first round of the playoffs, an 
experience they say they can draw on now, yet they know a repeat would be 
difficult because the Rangers are gathering strength from game to game. A sixth 
game would be played Saturday in Vancouver and a seventh on Tuesday in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going in there to just hand them the Cup," defenseman Dave Babych 
said. "We know we can play with those guys. Everybody is going to have to throw 
everything at them." 
</P>
<P>
 Throwing in a few power-play goals would help. The Canucks are one for 27 in 
the series and aren't getting off many shots against the Rangers' aggressive 
penalty killers. Finding a way to stop Brian Leetch would help, too, though 
there might be no way to keep the Ranger defenseman from winning the Conn 
Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things don't look great right now," Canuck center Trevor Linden said. 
</P>
<P>
 To the Rangers, things look promising enough to smile -- but no more. "All 
through the playoffs we've been saying we haven't won anything yet, and we 
really haven't," defenseman Jeff Beukeboom said. "Obviously, we're happy with 
where we are, but we're not getting ahead of ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither team practiced Wednesday after arriving from Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The NHL wants a separate parade in New York for the Rangers if both the 
Rangers and the NBA's Knicks win championships. 
</P>
<P>
 However, because of the expense involved with cleanup and police protection, 
it's likely they would share a celebration.

OWNERS SET STAGE FOR BASEBALL STRIKE; LABOR: COLLECTIVE-BARGAINING PROPOSAL 
REPORTEDLY INVOLVES SALARY CAP AND REVENUE SHARING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Major league baseball owners, meeting in Cincinnati on Wednesday, set the 
stage for a second-half strike by the players' union when they unanimously 
agreed to a collective-bargaining proposal calling for a new economic system 
based on a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the proposal will not be revealed until it is presented to the 
union in a negotiating session in New York next Tuesday, but the owners also 
moved to prevent defections of the type that have eroded their solidarity in 
seven previous labor confrontations. Any labor agreement must now be approved 
by three quarters of the 28 owners rather than a simple majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Only eight owners are needed to block a deal, and there seem to be at least 
that many small-market teams determined to change the system by hanging tough 
in a prolonged work stoppage. Don Fehr, the union's executive director, said 
the action was "ominous" and "extraordinarily negative." 
</P>
<P>
 "It would allow eight owners to perpetuate a dispute," Fehr said from 
Washington. "That is not a step in the right direction. It's the direction of 
people preparing for war." 
</P>
<P>
 The union considers a salary cap restrictive and fears that the owners will 
declare an impasse in the negotiations and unilaterally impose the new system 
-- which would also significantly modify free agency and arbitration -- if 
there is no agreement by the end of the season. The union's executive board 
will review the proposal next Thursday in Chicago and meet again in Pittsburgh 
on July 11 to set a strike date -- probably around Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dodger owner Peter O'Malley, speaking from Cincinnati: "I hope the 
players will consider (the proposal) without rejecting it out of hand. I think 
it's fair." 
</P>
<P>
 A source said the new system, which includes revenue sharing among the big and 
small markets, would be implemented in stages and not affect any player 
currently in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a plan that reflects the decade and the era we live in," interim 
Commissioner Bud Selig said, referring to the changing economics and the 
contention of chief negotiator Richard Ravitch that 19 of the 28 clubs are 
losing between $3 million and $12 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a fairer allocation of revenues between the clubs and the players," 
Selig said. "We need a closer sense of unity. We need it for a more competitive 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 In another anticipated development, American League owners hired University of 
Kansas Chancellor Gene Budig as their seventh league president. He received a 
four-year contract and will replace Bobby Brown, retiring after 10 years in 
office, on Aug. 1.

LANGSTON REWINDS TO FIND HIS GAME; BASEBALL: ANCIENT MARINER VIDEOS SHOW 
PITCHER HOW HE USED TO WIN. THEY COME IN HANDY AGAINST THE TWINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Mark Langston went looking for answers the other day he found them in the 
bottom of a closet at home. Videotapes. Dozens of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I opened my closet and there they were," he said. "I just decided to pull 
them out and look at them." 
</P>
<P>
 He popped a cassette into the VCR and hit the play button. He watched himself 
intently, noticing he looked decidedly younger, wearing a short haircut and a 
Seattle Mariner uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked like a kid," Langston said. 
</P>
<P>
 But casual appearances weren't really what Langston was after in an determined 
effort to snap out of the funk that caused him to lose four consecutive starts 
going into Wednesday's game against the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
 Something was off kilter. It would have been easy to pin the blame on the 
arthroscopic surgery he needed to remove bone chips in his left elbow. But 
Langston thought there was more to it. He believed he simply wasn't as 
aggressive as before he underwent surgery April 12. 
</P>
<P>
 The tapes proved Langston right and, armed with that knowledge, he went right 
after the Twins. 
</P>
<P>
 It worked, too. He gave up four hits and two runs with two walks and a 
season-high seven strikeouts in seven innings, winning for the first time since 
May 11. 
</P>
<P>
 He started the game having allowed 19 earned runs and 31 hits, including seven 
home runs, in his previous 19 2/3 innings. His last start ended when elbow 
stiffness forced him from the game after giving up four hits and four runs in 
four innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, he looked like a different pitcher and the reviews were rave. 
</P>
<P>
 "He supposedly has a sore arm," Minnesota second baseman Chuck Knoblauch said. 
"I'd like to see him 100% healthy. Early on, it seemed like he had the stuff to 
throw a no-hitter." 
</P>
<P>
 Said right fielder Kirby Puckett: "He was throwing the slider down and in to 
right-handed hitters like he used to. He must have known he had a good slider 
when he was warming up in the bullpen." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann: "We needed it." 
</P>
<P>
 It had been four years since Langston last looked that long and hard at his 
tapes, so you know there was a sense of urgency to his viewing. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time he struggled so much with his mechanics was in 1990, when he had 
a 10-17 record a 4.40 earned-run average in his first season as an Angel. Only 
once, in 1985, has he finished a year with fewer victories or a higher ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nineteen-ninety was definitely no fun at all," said Langston, 3-4 with a 5.49 
ERA this season. "I really struggled that year. I was off quite a bit in my 
mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Before Wednesday) I wanted to make some adjustments. I saw I wasn't 
aggressive in the strike zone." 
</P>
<P>
 Langston stayed ahead of the Twins, forcing them to hit only weak grounders 
and soft fly balls until a troublesome, two-run fifth inning. Langston gave up 
a two-out, two-run single by Knoblauch in the fifth. But the Twins couldn't get 
more off Langston and the Angel bullpen preserved a 5-4 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was huge for not only me but for our team," Langston said after the Angels 
won for only the second time in the last 10 games. "We need to put something 
together. I need to contribute. The five-run lead was a huge lift for me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pitching-wise, we have to get guys on a roll. Chuck (Finley) has picked us up 
after not winning a game in April. Now, we have to take the pressure off Chuck. 
Basically, he's been our guy. We haven't been consistent at all."

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; VALDES GETS CALL FOR RELIEF DUTY

<P>
 As expected, the Dodgers called up pitcher Ismael Valdes Wednesday, a 
20-year-old right-hander from triple-A Albuquerque who was nicknamed "Rocket" 
after Rocket Ismail, not because of his fastball. To make room, left-hander 
Gary Wayne has been designated for assignment with hopes that he will accept 
one in Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
 Ismael will join the team in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdes' will work in middle relief. He began the season in double-A San 
Antonio and was called up to Albuquerque a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been starting at Albuquerque, but we wanted the type of guy who could 
pitch short relief and pitch longer, too," Fred Claire, Dodger executive vice 
president, said. "As hard as (Darren Dreifort) throws when he goes out there, 
we don't want him to pitch more than an inning or two." 
</P>
<P>
 Valdes had a 3-0 record with a 2.77 earned-run average in four starts and 26 
innings at Albuquerque. Overall, he has 79 strikeouts and 15 walks in 79 1/3 
innings. 
</P>

 The team's trip to Chicago couldn't come at a better time for Brett Butler, 
who is concerned because his mother, Betty, who lives there, just learned that 
cancer has spread to her lymph nodes. MARYANN HUDSON

 Pitcher Russ Springer arrived at Anaheim Stadium and looked around, only to 
see a sign above the empty locker between outfielders Bo Jackson and Dwight 
Smith. It said: 
</P>
<P>
 "There goes the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good to be wanted, huh?" said Springer, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Springer, 7-4 with a 3.04 earned-run average at triple-A Vancouver, was called 
up to replace starter Phil Leftwich in the Angel rotation. Leftwich was put on 
the 15-day disabled list because of an inflamed lower right leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Springer, acquired along with first baseman J.T. Snow and reliever Jerry 
Nielsen in the Jim Abbott trade, will start Saturday against the Detroit 
Tigers. Considering the way he has been pitching, Springer said he will stay in 
the American League. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't ever plan on going back to Siberia," Springer said. "I'm throwing the 
ball as good as ever. I feel I can do the job here without changing anything." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 It wasn't pretty, but Joe Grahe closed out the Angels' 5-4 victory over the 
Minnesota Twins Wednesday after failing in his last two save situations. He 
gave up four hits and two earned runs, but struck out Shane Mack with runners 
on second and third to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Manager Marcel Lachemann: "I thought it was important to get him out 
there again. It just shows -- either you're going to have confidence in a guy, 
or bounce around with one guy or another and try to reinvent the wheel every 
time something goes wrong." BOB NIGHTENGALE

<P>
 Tom Werner, chairman of the San Diego Padres, has reached a tentative 
agreement to sell the team to Malcolm I. Glazer for $82.5 million, sources told 
The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Glazer is CEO of First Allied Corp. of Boynton Beach, Fla., a financial 
institution with investments in real estate and TV stations.His agreement with 
Werner hinges on the approval of other owners, a process believed to have 
started informally. 
</P>
<P>
 Werner was attending an owners meeting in Cincinnati on Wednesday and could 
not be reached. It is uncertain if he is simply reducing his majority ownership 
or leaving the club entirely. Glazer, who intends to keep the club in San 
Diego, a requisite of his approval, is believed to be buying out all of 
Werner's 14 partners, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Werner bought the club in 1990 from Joan Kroc. The reported price was $75 
million. ROSS NEWHAN and BOB NIGHTENGALE

 By Man -- By Zone 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the many changes in soccer tactics, the contract between man-to-man 
and zone play remains. 
</P>
<P>
 Man-to-man tactics mark players according to their position on the field. A 
zone defense usually plays for the offside trap or the full press. In an 
offside trap, defenders move up field in an attempt to draw attackers offside 
immediately after losing possession of the ball. Pressuring is an aggressive 
attempt to control the opponent in possession of the ball.

LUKAS PLANNING A GRADUAL RETURN TO WORK JUNE 27

 Jeff Lukas, critically injured when Tabasco Cat ran over him Dec. 15, is 
tentatively scheduled to return to work on June 27 for his father, trainer 
Wayne Lukas, at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 A visitor, along with wife Linda, to Hollywood Park on Wednesday for the first 
time since his accident, Lukas, 36, said he hopes to begin by working five 
hours a day, then gradually increase his schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm feeling well and looking forward to it," he said between the second and 
third races Wednesday. "It's another motion in the whole circuit (toward 
recovery) that I've gone through. I'm excited about the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The horses are at Santa Anita, and then we'll move on to Del Mar (which 
begins on July 27). I'll see how I feel, and I'll gradually move forward. I'll 
do the basics -- watch and observe the horses train, make out the (training) 
charts and instruct the employees." 
</P>
<P>
 Lukas, who said he will continue rehabilitation at Casa Colima for "a little 
while longer," played golf twice recently. "It was good relaxation," he said. 
"It was fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Lukas and his wife said they will watch the Belmont Stakes Saturday at their 
Glendora home, as they did when they watched Tabasco Cat beat Go For Gin in the 
Preakness.

 World Cup and Giants Stadium officials said they were doubtful the robbery 
reported Sunday by the Greek World Cup team actually happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Greece played Colombia at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., and Greek 
Coach Alkis Panagoulias said $17,800 in cash and jewelry was stolen from the 
players' hotel rooms after their keys were taken from the locker room at the 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Panagoulias blamed stadium officials for the theft, but those officials said 
Wednesday that the incident had been an "inside job" and "staged."

<P>
 World Cup Chairman Alan Rothenberg was asked about his strong comments 
defending the security practices.

 "I was angry," Rothenberg said. "The locker room in the Meadowlands is

TENNIS / DANA HADDAD; CALABASAS: THE YOUNG AND RESTLESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If anybody wanted to write a soap opera with a tennis motif, the 1994 season 
at Calabasas High would provide enough material for several episodes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Calabasas story involves nine highly competitive and quite animated 
teen-age boys and three different coaches with three acutely different styles 
who each held the reins for approximately one-third of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 It should be noted that those coaches -- Casey Allen, Cindy Jones and Ed 
Charles -- needed to grip those reins firmly for what was a strange ride. 
Before the season, the team's top player was lost to a strange back injury. At 
midseason the team's new No. 1 singles player withdrew from school to start a 
home-study program. 
</P>
<P>
 Even bus rides to matches were adventures. Said singles player Alex Wan: "I 
thought Miss Jones did a good job until the day our bus went to Sunny Hills 
(High) instead of South Hills." 
</P>
<P>
 The Coyotes also had to postpone a crucial match against Burbank because Allen 
resigned under pressure that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas eventually played all its matches, finishing 17-4. And despite all 
the turmoil, the Coyotes were the only area team to win a Southern Section 
championship when they routed Santa Ynez, 13 2/3-7 1/3, in the Division IV 
final. 
</P>
<P>
 The season remained a circus to the end. 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of the final, Charles, who coached the team the last three weeks, 
was quoted as saying that his players liked to talk a lot of trash and were 
listless in practice. The players said they couldn't believe it when they read 
those comments the day of the match. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the most part, the stuff he said was not true," said Jeff Herz, a junior 
who finished the season at No. 1 singles. "We're all pretty close and we all 
support each other. In practice, we say stuff to make each other play harder 
and get better. 
</P>
<P>
 "And how can you not work hard and win CIF?" 
</P>
<P>
 Even without its top two players, Calabasas was a talented bunch. Most were 
ranked junior players at one point and were still practicing as many as three 
hours a day with a private coach. Herz and others, in fact, said they really 
didn't need a coach -- just someone to supervise and give encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
 But portrayed as they were, the players hardly got a warm welcome when they 
took home the championship trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we went to school the next day, a lot of people looked at us as a team 
that had talent but was a bunch of jerks," Herz said. "We were upset by that. 
(Charles) said he did that to pump us up. I think he believed what he said. But 
I don't know how he could say that. He was only there for three weeks. He 
didn't know the team well enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles, the intense former coach at Cal State Los Angeles, was brought in by 
Jones, the athletic director. The players liked Allen's positive and relaxed, 
if not expert, approach to coaching tennis. But it became a little too relaxed, 
the players said, when Allen's sister served as a stand-in coach at a couple of 
matches. Allen, an off-campus coach, got a new job that created schedule 
conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen eventually resigned and Jones coached the team for several weeks on an 
interim basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Miss Jones was great," Herz said. "She really supported us. Her and Casey 
didn't know a lot about tennis but they really knew how to pump us up and keep 
us close as a team." 
</P>
<P>
 But all three coaches were courtside for the final. Charles, carrying a 
clipboard, hustled from court to court checking scores and plotting strategies. 
Jones kept the team score sheet. Allen, meanwhile, met discreetly with several 
players and did his own coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt we could have coached ourselves," said senior Phil Abramson, who 
played No. 1 doubles. "We made up the lineup. And if the lineup wasn't going 
well, we made suggestions for changes, and those were always the changes the 
coaches made." 
</P>
<P>
 One could say the inmates were running the asylum. Abramson said he liked the 
comrade-like approach Allen brought to the job. If the players didn't want to 
practice, Allen would call it off. Allen, who plans to take the team to a 
restaurant this Sunday for a celebration, often would join his players in a 
game of pickup basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles did that once in his brief tenure and got a real eye-opener. The 
jabbering was at a fever pitch and players scuffled more than once. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ed was getting bashed by some of the players after they scored on him," 
Abramson said. "He was just getting rocked by (singles player Assi Cohen), and 
Assi's got a big mouth. He was talking so much trash. Ed didn't really like it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a few shoving matches at practice. But it was just 
competitiveness, we thought. We thought that happens at all practices." 
</P>
<P>
 The Coyotes got a bad rap, Abramson said. They're good guys, if a bit cocky, 
he said.

KLEIN WILL GO FOR THE GREEN; NCAA CHAMPION TO LEAVE ARIZONA STATE, TURN PRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alas, despite a list of amateur credentials as lengthy as her 48-inch driver, 
Emilee Klein has some holes in her game. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, she rarely misses a fairway and is so fearless on the greens she can 
stare a six-foot knee-knocker into the hole. But later this year, Klein plans 
to make the quantum leap from college and amateur golf into the professional 
ranks, and she has some fundamental deficiencies to master first. After all, 
there are things that all successful players on the LPGA Tour must execute. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, every pro player worth a salt knows that after winning a big 
tournament and a staggering paycheck, there are a couple of celebratory 
options. For instance, a winner usually chucks the golf ball into the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't throw," Klein said. "(The ball) goes straight down into the ground in 
front of me." 
</P>
<P>
 Like most of her putts. The other option is jumping into a nearby water hazard 
and swimming a lap or two. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I could fall into a lake OK," she said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, it was time for Klein to sink or swim in the Women's NCAA Division 
I Championship at the Oregon Golf Club in West Linn, Ore. The wind was blowing 
and it rained during much of the final round. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't as easy as falling out of a boat, but the Notre Dame High graduate 
rallied from a slow start in the final round to win the individual championship 
and lead Arizona State to a runaway victory in the team competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she is only a sophomore, it was her final collegiate round. Moments 
after she clinched the title on No. 18, she was cornered by a television crew 
and asked what she would remember most about the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the last tournament I'll ever have to carry my own bag," she cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 Must have been pretty heavy, what with all of those championship trophies she 
bagged over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 After a summer filled with appearances in prestigious national amateur events 
and a couple of LPGA Tour stops, Klein will attempt to earn her tour card at 
qualifying school in the fall. If she follows her lifelong pattern, Q-school 
will be a formality. In fact, the queue may form behind Klein, who turns 20 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I truly believe she's ready," Arizona State Coach Linda Vollstedt said. "She 
plays within herself. She knows what her strengths are. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's very unusual for someone as young as she is." 
</P>
<P>
 For Klein, turning pro is the culmination of a logical progression that 
started when, as a 14-year-old freshman at Notre Dame, she became the youngest 
player to win the Women's California Amateur. 
</P>
<P>
 The target area quickly grew larger, her game more focused. In 1991, Klein won 
the U.S. Junior Girls' Championship and was named the Rolex national girls' 
junior player of the year.  
</P>
<P>
 She won the first tournament she entered as a collegian in 1993, finished 15th 
in her first NCAA championship tournament and won the whole ball of whacks last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning the NCAA title made for a perfect ending of another chapter for Klein, 
a former so-so journalism student at Notre Dame who said she can't remember "if 
any of my stories were ever published." 
</P>
<P>
 Now stories are written about her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't have asked for anything better," Klein said of her final college 
event. "I couldn't have written it better." 
</P>
<P>
 Reading and writing won't count for much on the pro tour, where 'rithmetic on 
the score card means everything. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite using a driver that is 4 1/2 inches longer than the norm for a men's 
club, Klein's drives this season found the fairway an almost incomprehensible 
92% of the time.  
</P>
<P>
 That was best in the nation, Vollstedt said. By any standard, a 48-inch driver 
-- particularly one fitted with a stiff shaft -- is a telephone pole. For 
Klein, who stands all of 5-foot-4, it's a redwood tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, she never hits one into the forest. Klein missed one fairway 
during the entire NCAA championship. She three-putted twice in 72 holes. She 
hit 16 greens in regulation in each of the first three rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Understatement underscored: "Consistency is probably the strongest part of my 
game," Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Next month, Klein will be part of the American team that will face a squad of 
Europeans in Chattanooga, Tenn., during the Curtis Cup. The Curtis is the 
women's version of the Walker Cup. Both are biennial events that rate as the 
Ryder Cup for amateurs. 
</P>
<P>
 This was all part of the Klein master plan -- sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really wanted her to stay in school for four years," said Klein's mother, 
Randee. "The LPGA Tour will always be there. But Emilee didn't really like 
going to class." 
</P>
<P>
 College golf was merely the means to an end for Klein. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just too hard to juggle everything," she said. "My sorority stuff, 
school, golf. . . . (Golf) is what I've always wanted to do. School just wasn't 
a priority." 
</P>
<P>
 Klein is the first to admit that playing -- and looking -- her best definitely 
is.  
</P>
<P>
 Those who know her had a hard time recognizing her during the televised final 
round of the NCAA Championships.  
</P>
<P>
 She takes great pride in her personal appearance, routinely wearing "lipstick, 
earrings, hair bows," and coordinated outfits during competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather, abysmal in the final round, made this nearly impossible.  
</P>
<P>
 Form and function became blurred. In her college swan song, Klein was forced 
to wear oversized rain gear that left her looking like the ugly duckling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I make a definite effort to look my best," she said. "But I was just trying 
to get through the round." 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA forbade players from wearing apparel with visible corporate logos, so 
Vollstedt was forced to place a piece of athletic tape over the insignia on 
Klein's cap. Vollstedt scribbled "ASU" on the tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Tres chic . Even worse, while Klein was standing on the practice range with 
her arms crossed before the final round, her photo was snapped.  
</P>
<P>
 Klein was yawning. She looked half-interested. Wouldn't you know it, the photo 
appeared a few days later in a national sports magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aw, why would they do something like that?" Klein's mother groused. "She 
always looks so nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Nice? In some ways, the civility of the college game will all but disappear 
when Klein bangs heads with the professionals. There will be no teammates, no 
support crew. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein has played in LPGA events before -- she was low amateur at the Dinah 
Shore last spring -- and feels the next competitive plateau will bring out her 
best. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing with them made me raise my game to that level," she said. "I feel 
I'll get even better if I play against them all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing at Arizona State didn't exactly quash her development. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sun Devils won the team title last week for the second consecutive year, 
only the third time in NCAA women's golf that a team successfully defended its 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 Some called Arizona State, which landed three players on the Division I 
All-American team, the best women's squad in college history. 
</P>
<P>
 Second to Klein in the NCAA individual race last week was teammate Wendy Ward, 
who also will play on the Curtis Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite playing the first four holes of the final round at four-over par, 
Klein managed to hold Ward at bay with a one-over-par 74.  
</P>
<P>
 Nobody was particularly shocked that it was an Arizona State runaway in the 
team and individual races. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some called it a college Dream Team," Vollstedt said. "I'm really glad we 
won, because if if we didn't, nobody would have remembered how good we were. 
Now we'll be recognized." 
</P>
<P>
 Klein, whose teammates waged daily war among themselves just to hold a spot in 
the starting five, said the accolades were accurate and then some.  
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to argue: Arizona State won the team championship by 16 shots over 
USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were the best," Klein said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if a team will ever be as good as we were. I know that sounds 
cocky, but we were really, really good. Unless some team played out of its 
mind, there's no way we were getting beat." 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament beat goes on for Klein. Armed with sponsor exemptions, she is 
entered this week in an LPGA event in Minnesota and will play in another in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
 She also earned an exemption into the U.S. Open and will play in the U.S. 
Amateur. 
</P>
<P>
 Qualifying school begins in late August. Beyond that, Klein will learn what 
the term money player really means. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's never going to stop being fun," she said. "Sure, there's money. But if 
you play for fun, because you love it, the money should take care of itself."

VAN BUREN WON'T BE BUFFALOED; FOOTBALL: WIDE RECEIVER, CONCERNED THAT COLORADO 
MIGHT WITHDRAW ITS OFFER, WANTS RELEASE FROM SCHOLARSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leodes Van Buren said Wednesday he wants to be released from his football 
scholarship to Colorado because he fears the school might withdraw its offer 
even if he is acquitted of a weapons charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newbury Park High wide receiver said he was angered after his attorney 
told him that Colorado might revoke his scholarship because of his legal 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're prejudging me," Van Buren said. "Just because I was accused of doing 
something doesn't mean I did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren, 18, will be arraigned today in Ventura County Superior Court on a 
felony charge of firing a gunshot into his girlfriend's Newbury Park home April 
8. He will plead innocent and request a trial, said his attorney, John Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very confident about this case," Van Buren said. "Once I prove that I'm 
innocent, I'm going to go play football somewhere else and get an education." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether he can play at another Division I school without losing a year of 
eligibility is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 An athlete who fails to honor his letter of intent can lose one or two years 
of eligibility, according to Prentice Gautt, an associate commissioner of the 
Big Eight Conference, of which Colorado is a member. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gautt said there is precedence for a mutual release from a letter of 
intent without loss of eligibility in cases involving legal issues, litigation 
or questionable behavior. The case would be reviewed by a national letter of 
intent committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said Wednesday he hoped to seek a release from the letter of intent 
without penalty, but had not yet spoken with Colorado officials to determine a 
course of action that would comply with NCAA and conference regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 But he agreed with Van Buren's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm incensed by this," Miller said. "Because someone has accused him (of a 
crime), the (Colorado) administration hasn't even given him a chance. We don't 
feel comfortable with a department that doesn't believe in due process." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of Van Buren's arrest, Colorado sports information director Dave 
Plati said that the scholarship was in jeopardy pending the outcome of the 
case. Plati said Wednesday he was unaware of any changes in the school's 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado coaches could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said he phoned the athletic department Tuesday to discuss Van Buren's 
standing with the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked, 'If I get him acquitted, what are the various outcomes?' I was told 
it really doesn't matter (if he's acquitted)." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren was arrested two months ago on suspicion of firing a shot into the 
home of his girlfriend, Marcie James. But Van Buren said the next day that a 
companion pulled the trigger and James, the key witness in the case, 
corroborated his account. 
</P>
<P>
 James, 19, has changed her story several times since that day -- depending on 
the state of her relationship with Van Buren -- but she testified under oath in 
a preliminary hearing May 26 that Van Buren did not fire the shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren led Newbury Park to the Southern Section Division III championship 
last fall. He is the state's all-time leader in receptions and receiving 
yardage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish Colorado the best of luck with football," Van Buren said. "But they 
won't be having me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll go win a national championship somewhere else."

'UNSUNG HERO' FOR GEORGIA TECH BELTS OUT THE TITANS' TITLE HOPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pair of aces squared off before a near full house in Rosenblatt Stadium 
Wednesday night. But long after the marquee starting pitchers had departed, a 
one-of-a-kind shortstop punched Cal State Fullerton's ticket home from the 
College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans will always remember Nomar Garciaparra, a 6-foot, 162-pound junior 
from Bellflower St. John Bosco High School, and not just because of his catchy 
name, which is his father Ramon's name spelled backward. 
</P>
<P>
 A first-round pick of the Boston Red Sox and a member of the 1992 U.S. Olympic 
team, Garciaparra sent Titan reliever Ted Silva's fastball in the top of the 
12th inning deep into the mist hovering above Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
 It finally landed several rows back in the left-field bleachers, well beyond 
the outstretched arm of Fullerton outfielder Brian King, and gave the Yellow 
Jackets a 3-2 lead they somehow retained in the bottom of the 12th. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans had speedster Dante Powell on third with no outs but couldn't push 
the tying run across against reliever Chris Myers, who struck out Sal Mancuso, 
retired D.C. Olsen on an infield pop and got King to fly out to center. 
</P>
<P>
 When center fielder Jay Payton clutched the final out, Georgia Tech players 
rushed the mound to celebrate a gut-wrenching victory that gave them a berth in 
Saturday's national championship game against either Oklahoma or Arizona State. 
The Yellow Jackets hope to become the first team since Minnesota in 1956 to win 
the title in their first trip to Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans, meanwhile, were left in a fog. They had staged several dramatic 
comebacks, most recently at the NCAA Midwest I Regional at Stillwater, Okla., 
to get to this point, and they simply didn't know how to react when they fell 
short. 
</P>
<P>
 Designated hitter Adam Millan, tears streaming down his face, buried his head 
in his hands as Powell and Coach Augie Garrido tried to console him. Other 
players just sat on the bench, dazed and confused. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're devastated because they don't believe something like this could 
happen," Garrido said. "They have the mentality that they're indestructible, 
and all of a sudden, something like this jolts you. You see the fly ball go out 
there, you know he's going to catch it, and it's kind of a helpless feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Titan pitcher Mike Parisi, who gave up two runs on seven hits in seven innings 
and battled Georgia Tech's Brad Rigby to a draw, knows the feeling all too 
well. He was in the same dugout and clubhouse, on the third-base side of 
Rosenblatt, when Fullerton lost to Pepperdine, 3-2, in the 1992 national 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in shock," Parisi said. "We have so many guys who care so much about this 
team. The hardest part is not losing, but knowing that so many guys aren't 
going to put on the Titan uniform again. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a feeling in the clubhouse that was like . . . wow, I've never been 
inside a room like that, with those emotions going on. It's sad, but we 
shouldn't hang our heads. We gave the best we had." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's loss was hauntingly familiar to the Pepperdine game, and not only 
because of the score. The deciding run in the 1992 game also came when a 
diminutive shortstop -- Pepperdine's Eric Ekdahl -- hit a homer into the 
left-field bleachers for the third run. 
</P>
<P>
 But Garciaparra was not nearly as improbable a hero as Ekdahl, Pepperdine's 
No. 9 batter who hadn't homered until the final game. Garciaparra's teammates 
have come to expect such heroics from their shortstop, who is batting .428 with 
15 homers and 72 RBIs as a leadoff hitter.  
</P>
<P>
 Garciaparra, the first-team All-American, was selected outstanding player of 
the Midwest II Regional after batting .500 with two homers and 10 RBIs, and 
Parisi said he's the toughest out in a lineup that includes All-Americans Jason 
Varitek (.423, 16 homers, 85 RBIs) and Jay Payton (.435, 20 homers, 102 RBIs). 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't begin to describe how much he means to the team," Georgia Tech right 
fielder Matt Saier said. "Varitek is the captain, but Nomar is our unsung hero. 
Whenever we need a clutch hit or to get someone on, he always comes through. It 
seems like 80% of his hits figure prominently in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 None of his hits this season was bigger than Wednesday's homer, which came on 
a 2-0 Silva fastball that was down the heart of the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach (Danny Hall) could have given me the take sign, but he said, 'Look for 
one spot,' " Garciaparra said. "He happened to throw it in that spot, so I was 
pretty pleased." 
</P>
<P>
 So was Garciaparra's father, a lithographic artist who was at the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always remember the smile on my dad's face when I hit a home run to win a 
game in Little League," said Garciaparra, the 12th pick in last week's draft. 
"He had the same smile on his face tonight, and that felt good."

IMPATIENT MULLIGAN MAKING QUICK STRIDES; BASKETBALL: IRVINE VALLEY COACH, ON 
THE MEND FROM A STROKE HE SUFFERED TWO MONTHS AGO, SAYS HE'LL BE BACK ON THE 
BENCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When an inch still matters, the basketball coach isn't through coaching yet. 
</P>
<P>
 The word is, Bill Mulligan has a 6-foot-10 kid coming to Irvine Valley College 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six- 11 ," Mulligan says. "And he says he's still growing." 
</P>
<P>
 Mulligan, the irrepressible, often irascible coach who has been a fixture in 
Orange County since he arrived at Saddleback College in 1975, suffered a stroke 
eight weeks ago, his second in 10 years. In the last decade, he also has 
undergone two arterial surgeries and a hip operation. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, he retired from UC Irvine amid the bitterness and frustration brought 
on by losing, then went stir-crazy looking for things to do, then unretired in 
1992 to start the basketball program at Irvine Valley College because he 
couldn't stand the boredom. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, despite a stroke that has forced him to practice his own signature, 
Mulligan, 64, says he'll be back on the bench -- or pacing beside it -- at 
Irvine Valley this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 He is still as wry as ever -- "The stroke didn't affect my voice or my logic," 
Mulligan says, eyes dancing. "My wife might say different." 
</P>
<P>
 But the bitterness that threatened to overtake his ebullient personality in 
his last years at UC Irvine has subsided. He's steadily overcoming the stroke's 
effects, and he counts himself a fortunate man. 
</P>
<P>
 Mulligan was at St. Joseph Hospital in Orange when he suffered the stroke 
April 13, the result of surgery in which a section of a groin artery was 
grafted to repair a 90% blocked carotid artery. Doctors had warned of the 
possibility, and when his right arm fell limp and all but useless he knew what 
had happened before they did. 
</P>
<P>
 This one was worse than the 1984 stroke and subsequent arterial surgery that 
forced him to miss UC Irvine's season-opener against the University of Colorado 
in Boulder -- the first game he had missed in 29 years of coaching. That time, 
when he came back to watch his team play, it was with this memorable line: "I 
came here with a pain in my neck," touching the scar on his neck. "and now I've 
got a pain in my gut." 
</P>
<P>
 This time the surgery was more involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last time, the doctor cleaned it out like Roto-Rooter," Mulligan said. 
"This time, they took five inches of artery from my groin. He told me if it's 
any consolation, I won't have to get it done again for another 25 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Mulligan spent six days at St. Joseph, and another six at St. Jude Medical 
Center in Fullerton as he began his rehabilitation. (Gene Murphy, the Fullerton 
College football coach and Mulligan's fellow Irishman, stopped by the hospital 
with a pair of Mulligan's trademark saddle shoes as a gift). 
</P>
<P>
 Mulligan still goes to St. Joseph three times a week, two hours at a time for 
rehab. But he is able to move his arm so well he's swimming laps in the pool in 
University Hills, where he and his wife, Dorothy, still live. It's the smaller 
tasks that Mulligan is still struggling with, and he looks disapprovingly at 
the piece of paper on which he has been writing his name and address over and 
over again in a shaky hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think probably the hardest thing is I'm very impatient," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Impatient? Mulligan? Could Wayne Engelstad and Jeff Von Lutzow disagree with 
that? 
</P>
<P>
 Mulligan has been helped through his rehab by his family, with Dorothy 
chauffeuring the back-seat driver and with one of his three sons, Brian, one of 
his assistant coaches at Irvine Valley, handling much of the planning for a big 
fund-raiser last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the stroke, (Brian) was amazing, getting everything done," Mulligan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy, the couple's oldest son, has helped, too. 
</P>
<P>
 When Mulligan fumbles when trying to turn the pages of the two newspapers he 
reads every morning, he thinks of Billy, who uses a wheelchair, unable to walk 
or speak clearly because he has cerebral palsy. 
</P>
<P>
 "My real hero in all this is Billy," Mulligan said. "He reads the paper down 
on the floor. When I think of everything he's gone through and all that you 
take for granted. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "He had the classic line. He uses his talking board, and after the stroke, he 
said, 'Better you than me.' 
</P>
<P>
 "When I consider that he graduated from college even though he can't walk or 
talk. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 As smooth a recovery as it seems Mulligan has had, he says it has been 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was down a lot, but you don't tell anybody," he said. "Who would want to 
come talk to you or see you if you're crying, 'Why did this happen to me?' 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been very difficult, but you have to decide that, 'Yeah, I'm going to do 
everything they want me to do.' I'm going to miss one session to go to Palm 
Desert, and the therapist said, 'Make sure you take a deck of cards,' because I 
have to take the cards and put all the aces in a pile and kings in a pile and 
queens in a pile, things like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Queens, Kings and Aces he has mastered. In a trip to Las Vegas after the 
stroke, he won $1,400 on a royal flush. 
</P>
<P>
 He's still likely to be seen massaging a wad of putty, working his fingers. 
And though it wasn't always certain, he says he will coach next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have four assistants, I don't have to do too much," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the things that will bring him back is the opening of Irvine Valley's 
new gym. The first two seasons, he and his team were vagabonds, practicing at 
night in other team's gyms. Mulligan would get home at 10:30 or 11, and he and 
Dorothy wondered if that was the way they wanted to spend their evenings. 
</P>
<P>
 He'll coach at least one more year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to do it, since we can practice in the afternoon. If we were going to 
be doing that night deal, there's no way I'd do it." 
</P>
<P>
 He and Dorothy, who before the stroke were planning to make their first trip 
to Ireland this summer, plan to go after another basketball season. 
</P>
<P>
 So Mulligan looks forward to seeing how Keon Clark, the 6-11 player steered to 
Irvine Valley by Temple Coach John Chaney, will do -- and toward another 
community college season, where the kids are the same as ever and the only 
irritating press is the other team's. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the big kid comes around, he's probably as talented as anybody I've ever 
had. John Chaney told me he'll be in the NBA in three or four years," Mulligan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lure of the game remains. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how much longer I'll do it, what the hell."

THE TIMES 1994 SPRING ALL-COUNTY TEAMS; NO ONE IS CLOSE TO BUYUKUNCU; SWIMMER 
OF THE YEAR: WOODBRIDGE SENIOR STEPS UP A NOTCH, PROVES HE'S ONE TO BEAT IN 
COUNTY, STATE AND NATION.

 Once in a great while, a swimmer will come along whose talent is metaphysical. 
Such is the case of Woodbridge's Derya Buyukuncu, The Times Orange County 
swimmer of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it seemed impossible that the 17-year-old Turkish student could swim 
any faster than last year, Buyukuncu came back in 1994 and made sure everyone 
knew he was the swimmer to reckon with in the county, the state and the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyukuncu came to Orange County to train with the Irvine Novaquatics in 1991. 
However, he was sidelined his sophomore year at Woodbridge because he didn't 
meet residency requirements. However, as a junior at the Southern Section 
Division I finals, he broke Derek Weatherford's 1988 national backstroke 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Southern Section finals this year, Buyukuncu was after another record 
-- Joe Hudepohl's national high school mark in the 50 freestyle. But because of 
the official's quirky start commands, Buyukuncu held onto the blocks for an 
extra moment in fear of being disqualified. He finished the race in 20.27, 
breaking the section record he set in the preliminaries a day before, but 
falling short of the record of 20.01. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I could have gotten that record," he said. "I just couldn't take the 
chance and get DQ'd. That wouldn't be good for the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Buyukuncu, who will attend Michigan in the fall, came back in the same meet to 
set a national record in the 100 backstroke and a section record in the 100 
free.

THE TIMES 1994 SPRING ALL-COUNTY TEAMS; O'BRIEN MAKING MARK IN SPRINTS; SWIMMER 
OF THE YEAR: IRVINE SOPHOMORE SET MEET RECORDS IN 50 FREESTYLE, AND JUST MISSED 
IN THE 100.

 Wendy O'Brien, 15, exploded onto the high school swimming scene in March, when 
she recorded a senior national-standard time in the 50-yard freestyle, 
finishing first at the junior nationals in Grand Forks, N.D. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say O'Brien, a sophomore at Irvine, wasn't already one of the 
county's top freestyle sprinters. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Foothill Swim Games in April, she set a meet record of 23.94 seconds in 
the 50 free, breaking a four-year record.At the same meet, O'Brien swam a 
personal best in the 100 free and came within 0.1 seconds of a record. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her victories in the 100 and 50 frees at the Sea View League 
finals, she broke a 10-year-old meet record in the 50 free with a time of 
24.13. 
</P>
<P>
 She would face her biggest challenge in the Southern Section Division II 
championship finals at Belmont Plaza Pool in Long Beach. There, Walnut's Judy 
Thomas and Arcadia's Lonna Stacey, who both had soundly defeated her in last 
year's finals, would again be in the 50 free field. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 50 free finals, O'Brien, who was fresh off a 22.80 freestyle anchor 
split for the winning 200 medley relay team, got off the blocks quickly and 
left no doubt she was the meet's fastest swimmer, finishing in a personal-best 
23.57. 
</P>
<P>
 Her winning time of 51.06 in the next race, the 100 free, was the 
eighth-fastest in the nation.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: A BET ON VIRTUAL GAMBLING COULD PAY OFF IN 
TECHNOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE, Michael Schrage is a writer, consultant and research 
associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He writes this column

<P>
 There's nothing wrong with America's nascent information highway policies that 
a little gambling couldn't cure. You can bet on it. 
</P>
<P>
 While the feds struggle to deregulate the Baby Bells, re-regulate the cable 
industry and guarantee every resident "universal service," the states have a 
unique chance to load their policy dice in ways that could accelerate public 
acceptance of new network technologies. If they play their cards right, states 
such as California and New York could simultaneously raise revenue, promote the 
rapid deployment of new-media technology and accelerate economic development -- 
all without raising taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 What it takes is the courage and creativity to put their lotteries on-line. 
</P>
<P>
 The raw economics alone are compelling: Two-thirds of the states run lotteries 
that together bring in more than $12 billion a year. The California lottery 
will have generated roughly $670 million for the fiscal year ending June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 What if people could pick their lucky numbers on a virtual lottery ticket by 
logging on at home? What if people who bought paper tickets could -- for a 
small extra fee, of course -- pick another number or two if they also purchased 
the digital version? There are all kinds of innovative ways of bundling paper 
and electronics to stimulate sales and improve everyone's chance of winning. 
</P>
<P>
 Add in revenues from parimutuel betting and card rooms and we're talking 
another $5 billion nationwide. Go the whole virtual casino route -- how about 
virtual poker or blackjack games? -- and market size could leap an estimated 
$10 billion. That's real money. 
</P>
<P>
 States all over the country are weighing the issues associated with legalized 
gambling. Many Native American tribes want to establish Las Vegas-like casinos 
on their reservations, and any number of economically challenged locales are 
convinced that letting people play the odds is the best way to achieve economic 
development through tourism. Some states are distributing video gambling 
machines in stores, and others are looking at riverboat gambling for their 
waterways. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic-development argument will work just as well for virtual gaming in 
a revenue-hungry state as for a real casino in a city with a dilapidated 
boardwalk. Which investment better reflects the future? These are issues Vice 
President Al Gore and his blue-ribbon committee on information infrastructures 
aren't touching. More than vague promises of universal service, on-line betting 
would offer a populist appeal for members of any economic class. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, gambling -- like any other economic vehicle -- has some serious 
drawbacks. But if we really care about having policies that promote universal 
service and make new technologies more accessible and affordable, shouldn't 
states be encouraged to explore on-line betting? With rigorous monitoring, it 
could provide one of the least expensive, most creative ways for a state to 
help define the networks of tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Why doesn't some enlightened state -- California? -- recognize the terrific 
opportunity here? 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, there would be important network, data integrity and security 
issues to resolve. Should there be special IDs? Would people have prepaid 
accounts? Or would they all be billed on a per-transaction basis? How would all 
this data be encrypted? Who would get access? These are tough design and 
implementation questions -- the kind that promote ingenuity and innovation. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, a state offering on-line wagers might rightfully insist that the 
cable or telephone company providing the service provide its betting technology 
to everyone. Needless to say, the specifications for that technology could 
assure that it is capable of transactions more sophisticated than scratching 
lotto numbers or betting Pimlico in the fifth. The point is that, carefully 
managed, on-line betting could drive market innovation and acceptance of new 
technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is little doubt that the public would embrace this kind of 
interactivity," says George R. Andersen, who runs Minnesota's $335-million 
lottery. "Lotteries are the most popular form of public participation, even 
above ATM machines right now. The state could be a driver of this." 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen should know. Three years ago, he proposed an on-line lottery that 
would be offered through home Nintendo game machines. The idea was shot down in 
a political firefight. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Andersen is trying to enhance the state's conventional lottery network 
by getting it to handle such public service items as hunting licenses and voter 
registration. Andersen believes the states will be "followers and not the 
leader" in encouraging on-line wagering. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Andersen points out, the history of lotteries has shown that if 
one state takes the plunge, others will follow.  
</P>
<P>
 "We (in Minnesota) could see the traffic going across the bridges to Wisconsin 
on jackpot nights," he recalls. "When we matched them, the border crossing 
slowed down." 
</P>
<P>
 With networks, however, geography is less relevant. There, a state lottery or 
poker game could just as easily be national, and being first could bring huge 
benefits. With competition among the states, we could see dozens of innovative 
on-line games of chance and skill. Does anyone doubt that would accelerate the 
creation and adoption of new technologies? Isn't that what we want? 
</P>
<P>
 It's time to roll the dice. Let the chips fall where they may.

CRITICS DECRY PACBELL CUT AS FAR TOO SMALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Public Utilities Commission voted unanimously Wednesday to cut 
Pacific Bell's telephone rates this year by $32.5 million, or about 13 cents a 
month for a typical residential user. 
</P>
<P>
 A consumer group immediately derided the sum as puny. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in July, phone customers will see a slight increase in a "surcredit" 
on their bills. That credit, which under the previous rate formula had come to 
about 37 cents on a typical monthly residential bill of $23, will now be 50 
cents. In theory, the amount will rise in 1995 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward Utility Rate Normalization, a consumer group, and MCI, the 
long-distance provider that expects to eventually compete with Pacific Bell in 
regional long-distance and local service, expressed dismay at what they contend 
is a paltry rate reduction. They and others, including the California Cable 
Television Assn. and Sprint, had urged the PUC to slash Pacific Bell's rates by 
$560 million over three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The five commissioners voted to change the way the San Francisco-based 
telephone company computes charges for its 9 million residential and 2 million 
business customers. The utility serves about two-thirds of California's more 
than 30 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other changes, the PUC raised Pacific Bell's so-called annual 
productivity factor to 5% from 4.5%. Regulators include in their rate decisions 
an assumption that technological and other improvements boost a phone company's 
efficiency and thereby reduce its costs. The PUC allows a certain percentage of 
that figure to go to ratepayers; as an incentive to cut costs, the company gets 
to keep any savings above that.  
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell had asked that the PUC leave the factor at 4.5%. The company 
could have fared far worse. In a March 7 proposal, PUC Administrative Law Judge 
Jacqueline Reed had advocated that the productivity rate be raised to 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 "They dodged a bullet," said Michael Shames, executive director of Utility 
Consumers Action Network, a consumer group in San Diego. Shames noted that some 
other state commissions are imposing much higher productivity requirements on 
utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The PUC also said in its ruling that Pacific Bell must split 50-50 with 
customers any return on its investment above 11.5%, instead of the current 13%. 
Anything above a 15% return would also be divided -- 30% for customers and 70% 
for shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 The company had asked the PUC to eliminate that sharing requirement and let it 
put the money back into infrastructure and the development of new services. 
Reed's proposal suggested eliminating the requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Brown, a regulatory attorney for MCI, said his company has "strong 
concerns as to whether the sharing mechanism . . . will actually create 
sufficient incentives" for Pacific Bell to increase its return. In the past, he 
noted, Pacific Bell has avoided sharing by failing to achieve the level of 
earnings that would trigger the requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 However, John A. Guelden, Pacific Bell's vice president for regulatory 
operations, said the company's return has been in the 11.5% to 12% range 
lately, indicating that the sharing mechanism will kick in.

IRS HAS THEM SEEING RED; CRACKDOWN ON INDEPENDENT CONTRACTING ANGERS FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In her bail bond business, Janis Van Pool sees plenty of bad guys. But her 
idea of the ultimate heavy these days is the Internal Revenue Service, which is 
trying to nail the Long Beach company for more than $100,000 in back payroll 
taxes, penalties and interest because of the way Van Pool categorizes her 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Pool has been snagged in an IRS crackdown on businesses that use 
independent contractors -- people who, in theory at least, work for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Pool and her husband, Vernon, have always considered the investigators, 
court checkers and others who work for them as outside contractors who set 
their own hours and provide their own equipment, she said. The IRS thinks Van 
Pool's workers -- who number only four now, down from 13 before her tax 
troubles -- should be classified as employees, which means more tax money for 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
 As in anything related to taxes, the issue is complex, with unhappy 
entrepreneurs blaming over-eager regulators, while federal and state tax 
collectors point to employer ignorance if not outright fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS has long complained that many businesses are not paying their fair 
share of taxes and that 3 million employees are wrongly classified as 
independent contractors. Employers who designate workers as independent 
contractors rather than employees avoid paying such things as Social Security, 
unemployment insurance and other payroll taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent contractors have proliferated during the recession as companies 
slash their work forces. In response, the IRS has clamped down on businesses 
big and little, most recently targeting the entertainment and construction 
industries, which use large numbers of independent contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 But small companies are hit hardest because they don't have the resources to 
battle the IRS if they disagree with the worker reclassification, said Jim 
Weidman, a spokesman for the Washington-based National Federation of 
Independent Business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a major problem for many small businesses," Weidman said. "It's been 
around for a long time, but it's been accelerating because it's a great 
moneymaker for the IRS." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been devastating," said Van Pool, whose tax case will be heard in U.S. 
District Court in July. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Van Pools lose, "we will probably be out of business and trying to get 
a job making beds in a hotel or something. I don't know," she said, her voice 
shaking. "It's bad. . . . The IRS doesn't care about our business. They're not 
there to help the business person." 
</P>
<P>
 IRS spokeswoman Judith Golden said the agency is simply enforcing the law. 
Unfortunately, she added, while there are 20 common law standards used to 
decide whether someone is an employee or an independent contractor, there is no 
simple formula for an auditor to use when assessing a company's practices. 
Disagreements result. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's become a very big issue, not only for us but for the state of 
California," Golden said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The basic thing it comes down to is, if someone is an employee they should be 
treated as an employee," Golden said. "When someone says, 'Hey, I'm creating a 
job and you're being mean to me,' we say, 'Well, part of creating a job is also 
taking responsibility.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The primary issue is control, said Robert Giannangeli, an IRS representative 
in Los Angeles. "If the employer is in control, the worker is an employee. 
Otherwise you have an independent contractor, a self-employed person." 
</P>
<P>
 Independent contractors should have their own city business license and 
separate bank account for their operations, said David Lee Rice, a Santa Monica 
attorney. "The first thing the IRS will ask is, 'Do they have their own 
business permit?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Independent contractors should also have their own business insurance and pay 
a self-employment tax, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another criteria for classification relates to whose standards determine how 
the work will be performed, Rice said. "For example, if I were to hire an 
associate attorney, can he or she do it his way, or do they have to conform to 
my standards? If they have to conform to my standards, then it smells like an 
employee." 
</P>
<P>
 The Van Pools' tax lawyer, A. LaVar Taylor, said his clients are frustrated by 
how inexact the standards are. The Van Pools and other clients caught in the 
same bind were operating in good faith, he said, and the IRS should compromise 
and allow such violators to reclassify their workers and begin paying taxes 
without being subjected to penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as they have acted in good faith and there has been no fraud or 
intentional abuse, let them convert and stay in business," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice said he thinks Congress needs to set explicit standards governing who is 
considered an independent contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a situation that many of my clients are facing, and it ultimately 
will put a number of them out of business," he said.

A RACE TO RULE THE SANDBOX; MATTEL-HASBRO WAR HAS TRANSFORMED U.S. TOY INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA K. H. WALTERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's no "Mortal Kombat," this head-to-head competition between Mattel and 
Hasbro over a British game company, but it's no mere friendly game of tag, 
either. Their rivalry dominates toy making in the United States -- and probably 
the world -- transforming what just recently was an industrywide consolidation 
into a two-company race to superiority and stability. 
</P>
<P>
 That the latest acquisition target is J.S. Spear & Co., owner of the overseas 
rights to Scrabble, demonstrates how each of the companies is looking to add 
muscle while decreasing vulnerability amid the cycles and fickle consumer 
tastes that can take the fun out of the toy business. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say the Mattel-Hasbro competition will continue, most likely focusing 
on product lines or companies that can enhance each's position in core industry 
segments and international markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both companies are growing in a consolidating industry, both have capital and 
both will compete on anything that's around, within reason," said Thomas R. 
Kully, securities analyst with William Blair & Co. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 El Segundo-based Mattel is clearly looking for more board games, a segment 
thoroughly dominated by Hasbro. Last week it offered $78 million for Spear, 
more than 10% higher than Hasbro's earlier bid of $70 million.  
</P>
<P>
 For Hasbro, based in Pawtucket, R.I., the attraction to Spear is more than 
solidifying its hold on Scrabble, which it sells domestically; it wants to 
increase its share of overseas markets, where Mattel leads. 
</P>
<P>
 Like two kids on a seesaw adding sand to their pockets, recent acquisitions by 
Mattel and Hasbro are keeping them very nearly balanced in terms of annual 
sales. Last year, Mattel bought Fisher-Price in a $1-billion deal that put it 
within $50 million of reaching Hasbro's $2.747 billion in sales. Tyco Toys was 
a distant third, posting sales of $730 million in 1993 and a loss of nearly $70 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, Mattel has bought the maker of Hula Hoops and Frisbees, and 
Hasbro has paid $105 million for Western Publishing's games and puzzles 
division. Simply adding up last year's sales of all the players, Mattel would 
be ahead this year with revenue of $2.879 billion, compared to $2.847 billion 
for Hasbro. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasbro could retake the lead with the addition of Spear, which had roughly $60 
million in sales last year. Spear's board is reportedly leaning toward the 
Mattel offer -- which Hasbro contends was made too late under London Stock 
Exchange rules -- but observers haven't ruled out a second round of bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This acquisition game, however, is more complicated than sales numbers, which 
both Hasbro and Mattel know can change in the wink of a trend. 
</P>
<P>
 Each is looking to shore up weaknesses, said industry analyst John G. Taylor 
of L.H. Alton & Co. in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to board games, Mattel is still lacking in action figures and 
other toys -- besides miniature cars -- that appeal primarily to boys. Its Hot 
Wheels line is strong, and its acquisition of Aviv three years ago gave it a 
solid line of activity and sports-related toys. Hasbro has G.I. Joe, which has 
regained some of its popularity but remains a second-tier entrant in action 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
 But each company rejected an offer of licensing rights to Mighty Morphin Power 
Rangers, currently the hottest action figure toys ever to disappear from toy 
store shelves. And neither company would be particularly interested in buying a 
maker of action figures, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they're searching for "evergreen" products that can withstand not 
only the boom-bust cycles of fads and the post-Christmas doldrums, but spawn 
generations of products and span generations of consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasbro is a more broadly based company than Mattel and thus has more cushion 
against the whims of popularity. It has tried and failed many times to crack 
into the U.S. fashion doll segment, where Mattel's Barbie is undisputed queen; 
however, through earlier acquisitions it acquired leading or second position in 
fashion doll markets in France, Britain and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Mattel -- which in 1992 made more than half its sales and nearly half 
its profits overseas -- has a broader distribution network internationally -- 
which analysts say will be the toy industry's major growth area. The Toy Market 
</P>
<P>
 Major toy manufacturers' share of the $11.7 billion U.S. toy market, ranked by 
1993sales: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Hasbro: 14% 2. Mattel: 12.5 3. Tyco: 4.0 4. SLM International: 1.0 5. 
Galoob: 1.0 6. Revell-Monogram: 0.5 7. Other: 67.0 
</P>
<P>
 NOTE: The figures for Mattel are pro forma; they reflect the company's merger 
with Fisher-Price for the entire 1993 period. Videogame companies are not 
included in this chart.

 Northrop Grumman Picks New B-2 Head: The aerospace concern named Ralph D. 
Crosby Jr. general manager of its B-2 bomber division, and it announced new 
managers for three of the four divisions created by Northrop's recent purchase 
of Grumman. Crosby, 46, succeeds Oliver C. Boileau, who was previously named 
president of the Grumman subsidiary.The company said John E. Harrison, 58, was 
named general manager of its electronics and systems integration division; 
Wallace C. Solberg, 63, will head its military aircraft unit, and Gerald H. 
Sandler, 59, was named general manager of data systems and services. Management 
of its commercial aircraft division will be announced later this year. The 
Senate Armed Services Committee appears headed toward providing $150 million to 
support the B-2 program beyond production of the currently authorized 20 
aircraft.

TECHNOLOGY SELLOFF TRIMS DOW; JAPAN STOCKS SURGE

<P>
 As Tokyo stocks reached a two-year high, U.S. blue chip issues closed lower 
Wednesday, depressed by a selloff of technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Yields of long-term Treasury bonds ended slightly higher after seesawing in 
reaction to comments made by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and 
other top officials. Greenspan told a meeting of central bankers in London that 
U.S. inflation appears to have been restrained for now. 
</P>
<P>
 German Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer echoed Greenspan's sentiments. 
Tietmeyer said he hopes and expects to see a falling inflation rate. The price 
of the Treasury's main 30-year bond dropped 7/32 point, or $2.19 per $1,000 in 
face value. The yield rose to 7.28% from 7.26%. Prices of shorter-term Treasury 
securities were mostly unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid growing signs of impending economic recovery in Japan, the 225-stock 
Nikkei index rose 219.24 points, or 1.04%. It closed at 21,261.95, the highest 
level since March 2, 1992. That left the index up about 22% for the year. It 
rose another 129.03 points in morning trading today.  
</P>
<P>
 Analysts and government officials remain divided as to whether Japan's worst 
postwar recession is ending, but fear of moving into the market too late is 
bringing even relatively cautious Japanese institutional investors back in 
force. Until now, this year's strong rise in Japanese stocks was led by 
foreigners betting on long-term prospects. Volume was heavy, with an estimated 
600 million shares changing hands.  
</P>
<P>
 A report from the Yamaichi Research Institute of Securities and Economics 
expressed a widespread view that an economic recovery in Japan will clearly be 
under way by fall. The report predicted that from April 1 to Sept. 30, profits 
for Japan's 701 major publicly traded companies will be down 13.5% compared to 
the previous year. But it said that in the ensuing six months, profits will 
jump 23.4% over the year-earlier period.  
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts were even more optimistic. "Corporations are beginning to reap 
the success of two or three years of restructuring, and as a result of that, 
profits are poised for a very strong recovery," said Jesper Koll, an analyst at 
S.G. Warburg Securities. "I think there can be an explosion of profits in 
Japan. Profits could easily double over the next two years." 
</P>
<P>
 But consumer insecurity and a strong yen make officials cautious. "It would be 
nice if I could say the economy has bottomed, but I can't say that yet," Eijiro 
Hata, minister of international trade and industry, told reporters Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 While restructuring is helping to boost profitability at many Japanese firms, 
it has taken a toll in layoffs, forced early retirements and sharply reduced 
hiring prospects for college graduates. There is also continued pressure on 
wages, largely through cuts in the size of traditional twice-yearly bonuses, 
which constitute about 30% of the average company employee's pay. A survey of 
325 major corporations released Wednesday by the Japan Federation of Employers 
Assns. revealed plans to cut bonuses by an average of 2.7% this summer, a 
record reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 6.46 points to 3,749.45. 
The technology-heavy Nasdaq index plunged 9.51 to 729.79. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're taking out some of these technologies and shooting them," said Leon 
Brand, global market strategist at NatWest Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology stocks were hurt by speculation that the book-to-bill ratio -- a 
barometer of the semiconductor industry's activity -- would be down for the 
first time this year with the onset of the historical summer slowdown.  
</P>
<P>
 "The performance of semiconductors sort of set the tone for the market," said 
Bill Allyn, director of listed equity trading at Jefferies & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the selling spree in technology stocks was a follow-up to 
Tuesday's downturn in economically sensitive cyclical stocks. This indicated 
that while major indexes appear stuck in narrow ranges, individual groups were 
being scrutinized, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is sort of a stock picker's paradise," said Gene Jay Seagle, a technical 
analyst who heads Tactics & Technics. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar was mixed in foreign trading. It weakened against the Japanese yen 
after U.S. officials said the government won't rule out trade sanctions as a 
means of forcing open Japan's markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold prices were higher. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for 
current delivery rose 60 cents an ounce to $381.70. 
</P>
<P>
 A report on wholesale prices is expected to be released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 Merisel plunged 6 3/4 to 10 after warning that its second-quarter earnings 
will be significantly below analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Among computer makers, International Business Machines dropped 1 to 61 5/8; 
Compaq fell 2 to 34 3/8; Dell ended off 1 3/4 at 26 1/2; Apple shed 1 3/8 to 26 
1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 In the semiconductor group, Texas Instruments fell 3 1/2 to 76 1/4 and Cirrus 
Logic ended 2 5/8 off at 30 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Vitamin maker Nature's Bounty fell 3 7/8 to 7 3/4. It cited 
slower-than-expected sales and earnings due to the impact of a recent report on 
Vitamin E and beta carotene published in the New England Journal of Medicine. A 
second vitamin retailer, General Nutrition, also on the Nasdaq, fell 1 1/2 to 
18. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, released in April, found that Vitamin E and beta carotene 
supplements were ineffective in preventing lung cancer in smokers and might be 
harmful. 
</P>
<P>
 Share prices also climbed in London and Paris, rebounding from declines 
Tuesday with the help of favorably received economic news and technical forces. 
</P>
<P>
 In Germany, share prices finished higher overall for the first time this week. 
The DAX-30 index was up 10.10 points at 2,145.20. 
</P>
<P>
 European bond markets reversed the previous day's losses after the Bundesbank 
cut money market rates. The 10-year German bond's yield fell to 6.91% from 7% 
on Tuesday.

NEW WORLD PURSUING NASHVILLE STATION FOR SWITCH TO FOX; TELEVISION: THE 
ACQUISITION WOULD MEAN ANOTHER LOSS OF AN AFFILIATE BY A BIG THREE NETWORK. 
</P>

 New World Communications Group, which shook up the media world two weeks ago 
when it announced it would convert eight CBS stations it owns to Fox 
affiliates, is negotiating to acquire WSMV-TV in Nashville, Tenn., industry 
sources said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 New World would switch the popular NBC affiliate to Fox, the sources said. Fox 
is currently carried on WZTV-TV in the market. The deal is reportedly valued at 
more than $100 million, sources added. 
</P>
<P>
 WSMV is owned by Cook Inlet Communications Corp., which also agreed Wednesday 
to sell WTNH-TV, the ABC affiliate in Hartford and New Haven, Conn., to LIN 
Broadcasting Corp. for about $120 million plus 11.5% of LIN's common stock. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, LIN announced it would spin off about 42% of the common stock of 
LIN Television Corp., which owns seven TV stations, to its shareholders. LIN is 
owned by McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., which will remain its shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
 New World has been negotiating for WSMV-TV for several weeks, and a deal is 
expected to be concluded shortly, the sources said. LIN and New World could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The broadcasting industry has been in near turmoil since Fox unveiled a deal 
last month to invest $500 million in New World, in exchange for 20% of the 
company stock and the eventual conversion of up to 12 New World-owned TV 
stations to Fox affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
 TV station owners have watched almost overnight as their assets have risen in 
value as the networks jostle for new affiliates in the wake of Fox's raid on 
CBS stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Underlying the renewed confidence in over-the-air broadcasting is the 
turnaround in the national TV advertising marketplace and the emerging 
consensus that the information superhighway will be more costly and take much 
longer to build than once projected. 
</P>
<P>
 Many broadcasters are anticipating a renewed bidding frenzy for TV stations, 
similar to the one that swept the industry in the mid- to late 1980s.  
</P>
<P>
 New World is controlled by Revlon cosmetics mogul Ronald O. Perelman. As part 
of the Fox deal to invest $500 million in New World, the two companies will 
jointly develop programming for syndication and the Fox network.

U.S. URGES OECD TO BROADEN ITS FOCUS, MANDATE; RELATIONS: AT ANNUAL MEETING IN 
PARIS, MEXICO BECOMES THE GROUP'S FIRST NEW MEMBER IN 20 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher on Wednesday called on the Organization 
for Economic Cooperation and Development -- often known as the West's "rich 
man's club" -- to expand its vision and mandate to accommodate the post-Cold 
War world. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot allow new divisions to arise. Europe must not be split into zones 
of prosperity and poverty, stability and insecurity," he said at the OECD's 
annual ministerial meeting, where Mexico became the group's first new member in 
more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 By broadening its focus and membership, the OECD can coordinate economic 
progress at a time of accelerating change and help "more countries throughout 
the world enter the community of advanced industrial nations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The speech was part of a broader U.S. effort to reassess and adapt the 
political and economic institutions created after World War II to the post-Cold 
War era, according to senior U.S. officials. 
</P>
<P>
 OECD membership is limited to democracies with market economies. But in a 
clear effort to encourage non-members, Christopher said, "An open, creative and 
dynamic OECD can help enlarge the community of free and prosperous nations 
throughout the world." He specifically mentioned South Africa as well as Asian 
and Latin American regions. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher's speech came as the OECD opened membership negotiations with 
South Korea, which is expected to join as early as 1996, and the four East 
European countries of Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Wednesday, the OECD signed a cooperation agreement with the Russian 
federation to provide expertise to help build a market economy there. 
Eventually, the OECD will conduct a review of Russia's economy, identifying 
what works and what doesn't, and will offer training, technical and policy 
advice, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Encouraging Russia's integration with the West is the best investment we can 
make in our security and in the security of all the peoples of Europe," 
Christopher said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the actions taken by the OECD this year are historic ones that would 
have been unimaginable five years ago. But Christopher warned that the 
"scourges" of "hunger, poverty, despotism and chaos" that once plagued postwar 
Western Europe are still vivid elsewhere, notably in the former Yugoslavia, and 
threaten other areas such as the former Soviet republics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It continues to be in the interest of the world's advanced industrial 
democracies to help ensure that dislocation does not lead to disillusionment 
with democratic institutions and free markets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The OECD is also expected to initiate talks with China about global trade 
issues, U.S. officials said. But any form of membership for Beijing is still 
remote.

MERISEL SHARES OFF 40% ON NEWS OF LOWER PROFIT MARGIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Shares in Merisel Inc. of El Segundo plunged 40% on Wednesday on news that the 
computer hardware and software distributor's second-quarter earnings will be 
lower than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Merisel Chief Executive Michael Pickett announced Tuesday that lower profit 
margins and unexpectedly high merchandise returns would push earnings for the 
quarter down to between 9 and 12 cents per share.Analysts had predicted about 
29 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street's response was swift: Merisel shares lost $6.75 in Nasdaq trading, 
closing at $10. About 8.8 million shares changed hands -- many times the norm 
for Merisel. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Financial Officer James Brill said the company intentionally trimmed its 
margins by cutting prices to stimulate its wholesale business. He said Merisel 
wanted to assure investors that the company was not changing focus from 
wholesaling with its recent acquisition of 160 Computerland retail outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Kulp, an analyst at Feeley & Wilcox in New York, said that, given the 
boom in computer sales, Merisel's long-term prospects appear healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a rough week for computer retailers. On Monday, shares in CompUSA 
fell to an all-time low on news that the company might report a fourth-quarter 
loss. CompUSA lost $2.375 to close at $9.50 on the New York Stock Exchange on 
Monday; it closed at $9.125 on Wednesday.

 Times Mirror Sued Over Cable Plan: Times Mirror Co., publisher of the Los 
Angeles Times, has been sued by at least three shareholders over its plan to 
spin off its cable television operations. The lawsuits claim that the plan, 
which would merge Times Mirror's cable operations with those of Cox Cable 
Communications in a $2.3-billion deal, would unfairly favor members of the 
founding Chandler family, who own 55% of the company's voting stock.Los 
Angeles-based Times Mirror confirmed that three shareholder lawsuits have been 
filed in Delaware, where the company is incorporated. Wire service reports said 
that as many as five or six lawsuits have been filed this week. A Times Mirror 
spokesman said the company had no further comment.

 2nd-Largest Shareholder Opposes UAL Buyout: Vanguard-Windsor Funds Inc., which 
controls 2.4 million, or 9.7%, of the 24.4 million outstanding shares in United 
Airlines' parent company, says it will vote against the employee buyout plan, 
arguing that it offers too little cash to shareholders. The deal would give 
employees an initial 55% stake in UAL Corp. in exchange for wage and work-rule 
concessions. John Neff, Vanguard-Windsor portfolio manager, said he will not 
support the deal unless the unions sweeten their offer.

 PaineWebber to Establish Fund to Repay Losses: The company said it will pump 
$33 million into the $1-billion government bond fund to repay investors who 
lost money on the securities firm's holdings of mortgage derivatives. 
PaineWebber Group Inc. also said it will buy the mortgage derivative securities 
owned by the Short-Term U.S. Government Income Fund, and it agreed in principle 
to settle class-action litigation by some fund investors.Government bond funds 
are rated AAA and are considered among the safest investments. PaineWebber's 
moves follow a 5.7% decline in its short-term fund's value between January and 
May, including a plunge of 4% on May 6. The fund was unusual because its 
mortgage-backed bonds were an especially risky type whose value was based on 
the value of some other asset.

 Accounting Group Delays Stock Option Rule: Stock option-granting companies 
from California to New Jersey breathed a collective sigh of relief when the 
Financial Accounting Standards Board opted not to require companies to disclose 
in 1994 financial reports just how much their stock options cost them. The 
accounting industry's main rule-making body still wants to force companies to 
disclose the cost of granting stock options to executives and other 
employees.However, hundreds of companies objected to the change, saying they 
did not believe current valuation methods accurately reflected the cost of 
executive stock options. The board, which is mainly concerned with making sure 
financial statements accurately reflect companies' health, says it will 
continue to study the issue. A final ruling is not expected until early 1995.

 NME Acquisition Discounted: Rumors swirled through the stock market that 
National Medical Enterprises Inc. would acquire American Medical Holdings Inc., 
but analysts and sources familiar with the situation discounted the talk.Both 
Santa Monica-based NME, which owns and operates acute care and psychiatric 
hospitals, and AMI, a Dallas-based operator of acute care hospitals, declined 
to comment. Earlier in the day, traders said American Medical's stock rose 
sharply on rumors that NME would acquire the company for $35 a share, or $2.7 
billion. National Medical stock closed off 12.5 cents at $16.625. American 
Medical rose $1.125 to $25.25.

 Business travelers who thought they understood the pros and cons of each 
mileage program need to recalculate over the next year as most of the major 
airlines make their plans more restrictive. The key change is raising from 
20,000 to 25,000 the number of miles needed for a ticket within the continental 
United States and Canada. Some have also increased their requirements for 
travel to Mexico or the Caribbean and to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are some bright spots. 
</P>
<P>
 * TWA intends to hold the line at 20,000 for a domestic ticket, a spokeswoman 
said. But the airline did raise the mileage level for a second ticket to Europe 
to 50,000 miles, from 40,000 previously, and boosted the requirement for travel 
to the Middle East to 50,000 miles year-round, from 35,000 miles previously for 
winter flights. 
</P>
<P>
 * Southwest Airlines, which bases its program on trips rather than on miles, 
recently cut its requirement to eight round trips (instead of 10) to qualify 
for a free round trip. But the airline requires that the eight round trips be 
made within 12 consecutive months. 
</P>
<P>
 * Delta decreased its requirement for a domestic coach ticket from 30,000 to 
25,000 miles. But the airline also imposed a new expiration requirement, though 
it is less severe than other airlines' because fliers can keep mileage by 
taking a trip on Delta every few years. 
</P>
<P>
 While miles earned to date and until the change takes effect on May 1, 1995, 
will be valid as long as Delta runs a frequent-flier program, miles earned 
after that date will be good only for 36 months from the date of the traveler's 
most recent trip. 
</P>
<P>
 * Miles themselves are becoming increasingly exchangeable. American Express 
Travel Related Services Co., for example, recently announced that five major 
hotel chains have entered into its program -- called Membership Miles -- making 
it possible to turn frequent-flier miles into free hotel stays.

PERSONAL VIEW: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Name: Leonard Kane 
</P>
<P>
 * Position: Airline pilot, USAir 
</P>
<P>
 Let's talk about some facts and figures from the scientific investigations on 
in-flight air quality. 
</P>
<P>
 * Airflow: The total volume of cabin air is exchanged approximately every two 
to three minutes. Airflow for first class and business class is the same as 
coach. But coach's higher-density seating creates a lower airflow per 
passenger. The flight station has a higher airflow than the cabin to provide 
cooling for electrical equipment and account for increased solar loads and 
nighttime heat loss through the large windows. The higher air flow also gives a 
positive pressure to the flight station to prevent the ingress of smoke from 
adjacent areas in the event of an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all newer-production jet airplanes provide 50% conditioned fresh air 
and 50% recirculated air for a total air supply of approximately 20 cubic feet 
per minute per passenger. Most older jets don't have an air-recirculating 
system. The average office building uses 75% to 95% recirculated air.  
</P>
<P>
 The recirculated air is filtered and cleaned through high-efficiency filters 
that are similar to those used in a "clean room," where computer chips and 
other stuff that needs to be better than squeaky clean are made. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics suggest increasing the conditioned fresh air to 100% and 
eliminating all recirculated air. That would lower the cabin's concentration of 
carbon dioxide an insignificant amount. However, it would raise the potential 
cabin ozone concentration and lower the relative humidity, which, according to 
an Air Transportation Assn. study, could cause sore throats and headaches. 
</P>
<P>
 * Microbial aerosols: These are the bad buggies that reporters complain about. 
They include viruses, bacteria, fungal spores and other scary stuff with 
weird-sounding medical names. The TV program "20/20" covered these in detail. 
What they didn't say was that these same buggies are everywhere -- in your 
house, your car, your workplace, your office, etc. You can't avoid these 
things.  
</P>
<P>
 The same high-efficiency filters mentioned earlier remove these contaminants 
from the cabin. These are the same types of filters used by hospitals to keep 
the air clean in their organ transplant and burn treatment rooms. If doctors 
and patients are comfortable with the clean air in these hospital areas, maybe 
we can relax and enjoy the clean air in the cabin. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oxygen: There have been articles alleging that the airlines are starving you 
of oxygen. How silly! But some people believe everything they read. The air we 
breathe at cruise altitude is approximately 21% oxygen. Remember, we breathe at 
a rate of approximately one-third of a cubic foot per minute while sitting in 
an airplane. In the worst-case scenario, you're getting at least 6.5 to 8 cubic 
feet per minute of conditioned fresh air. In other words, it's impossible to 
breathe all the oxygen in the air that's provided. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line is: Worry about crime, drugs, your family, our schools or 
whatever else. The cabin air quality is A-OK.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; NO RUSH ON THOSE AIRLINE AWARDS -- 
YET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 As airlines gear up for what they hope will be one of their busiest summers in 
years, business travelers have worried that more restrictive mileage 
requirements that take effect next year will cause a rush on awards as people 
hurry to book free seats before next February's deadline. But airlines say the 
number of seats available hasn't changed.  
</P>
<P>
 Airlines expect a jump in mileage redemption requests, but it may come closer 
to the end of the year, said Tony Molinaro, a spokesman for United Airlines. 
And because award tickets are good for a year, the real crunch may occur next 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 United, Continental Airlines, American Airlines and USAir are raising the 
number of miles required to earn free air travel. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, instead of requiring 20,000 frequent-flier miles to get a free 
trip within the continental United States, it will take 25,000 miles next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far there's been no big spike up (in redemptions), but they still have 
seven or eight months left," Molinaro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the number of seats allotted for use by travelers with free tickets is 
limited, customers have the best luck of securing seats if they plan well in 
advance, book less popular flights or are willing to be wait-listed for 
flights, airline representatives said. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental Airlines, which not only increased the number of miles required to 
get free tickets but also reduced the number of types of rewards it offers, 
said redemption requests are running about the same as always. However, tickets 
in general are more difficult to get because of new low fares the airline now 
offers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We are seeing a busier summer than we've seen in several years," Continental 
spokesman David Messing said. 
</P>
<P>
 The airline isn't alone. The Travel Industry Assn. in Washington is projecting 
a 4.5% to 5% increase in all types of travel this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 About 230 million people are expected to take trips this summer, and 15% of 
those trips will be by air, association spokeswoman Shawn Flaherty said. The 
travel industry outlook is brighter because consumer confidence is at its 
highest level in recent years, she said, and good travel cycles follow 
recessions in fairly predictable ways.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite airline reports that award seats are as available as ever, some 
industry observers are detecting more frustration on the part of passengers 
trying to find free seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Are more people redeeming their awards, and are more people having trouble 
getting reservations with them?  
</P>
<P>
 "Yes to both," said Ken Heldt, director of frequent-flier services for RAN 
Decisions, a Colorado Springs, Colo.-based consulting company that specializes 
in corporate travel programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But part of the problem is expectations, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 One reason people may perceive that it is harder to get tickets this summer is 
that many people want to travel to the same places -- popular vacation spots -- 
and those tickets dry up quickly in summer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you can't even find a revenue (full-fare) ticket to Hawaii," Heldt 
said. "People are exaggerating the situation when they say, 'I can never use an 
award when I want to.'  
</P>
<P>
 "In fact, they probably could use their awards if they were willing to fly 
during off-peak hours or to less popular destinations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never had a problem in using my own personal flier miles," said Chris 
Chiames, a spokesman for the Air Transport Assn. in Washington, a trade group 
representing airlines. "But then again, I choose my flights. I know I can't 
(use the award) to take the 5 p.m. from New York to Chicago. That flight is all 
business travelers, and the airlines know they can sell it out at full fare so 
won't offer any free seats on a leg like that." 
</P>
<P>
 For passengers who prefer to keep their points instead of rushing to use them 
during what may be a particularly busy time, Heldt says there are many ways to 
make up the additional points required for free tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Points can be earned by using special credit cards and long-distance calling 
cards, eating at certain restaurants, staying in hotels, even sending flowers, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Such strategies have definitely helped minimize the impact of the higher 
mileage minimums, said David Stempler, executive director of the International 
Airline Passengers Assn. in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point we have been making to our members is that there haven't been any 
raises in these programs for a very long time, plus with all the (tie-in 
programs), the extra 5,000 miles is noticeable but less significant," he said.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; COALITION WILL LOBBY WASHINGTON TO END EMBARGO AGAINST 
CUBA; TRADE: AMERICANS SEE OPPORTUNITIES BEING LOST TO FOREIGN FIRMS. CASTRO'S 
RULE IS THE POLITICAL STICKING POINT. 
</P>

<P>
 From Albania to Vietnam, U.S. companies have been busy establishing operations 
as communist regimes have died out or embraced capitalist reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, just 90 miles off Florida, Cuba remains virtually sealed off to American 
business people in the face of a 31-year-old U.S. government trade embargo that 
is as strong as ever. Meanwhile, foreign companies, from Canadian mining firms 
to Spanish hoteliers, have set up joint ventures with Fidel Castro's 
cash-starved government. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite prevailing political sentiments, a coalition of Cuban American, 
humanitarian and religious groups will lobby Congress and the Clinton 
Administration today to end or at least ease the embargo, which they regard as 
a useless relic of the Cold War era. 
</P>
<P>
 The 50 organizations participating in National Public Education Day on Cuba 
say the economic blockade has caused enough hardship on Cuban citizens and does 
not make sense since embargoes against Vietnam and other communist countries 
have been scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Levinson, executive director of the New York-based Center for Cuban 
Studies and a participant in today's lobbying effort, said the coalition is 
counting on American business to pressure Congress and the Administration for 
an end to the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot is going to depend on how tough business people are going to be with 
the Administration," Levinson said. The coalition will push for passage of the 
Free Trade With Cuba bill introduced in the House last year by Rep. Charles B. 
Rangel (D-N.Y.). It would eliminate all restrictions on travel to and trade 
with Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Defenders of the embargo say it is an important weapon that could ultimately 
undermine Castro's grip on Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 In the short run, Cuba appears to be the kind of place most American firms 
would want to avoid. The average worker earns less than $15 a month and the 
government has not made a payment on its $6-billion foreign debt since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the island nation is the largest single market in the Caribbean. With 
11 million consumers, its long-term economic potential could be bright if the 
government adopted economic and political reforms, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 If the embargo were to be lifted, U.S. firms could generate $2 billion in 
sales to Cuba in the first year, according to some Latin American business 
consultants. Likely areas for American investments include agriculture, 
tourism, mining, medical care and construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think U.S. business is taking a hard look at the potential for business and 
trade with Cuba," said Arturo Villar, the Cuban-born publisher of Miami-based 
Latin American Business Reports.  
</P>
<P>
 AT&T, for example, recently sent a team of executives to Havana. The 
long-distance telephone company is seeking to someday establish direct phone 
service between Cuba and the United States. Currently, the U.S. government 
limits AT&T to a maximum of 300 operator-assisted international calls a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about 100 American firms are permitted to conduct business with Cuba on a 
limited basis. United Airlines last fall began three flights a week from Miami 
to Havana in cooperation with a charter tour company that sells the tickets.  
</P>
<P>
 Would United be interested in expanding service if the embargo ends? "Yes, we 
would," said spokesman Joe Hopkins. But many Cuba watchers see little chance of 
it ending with Castro still in power. 
</P>
<P>
 While U.S. firms wait on the sidelines, foreign companies have been entering 
into ventures with the Cuban government.  
</P>
<P>
 "The most lucrative opportunities tend to be taken up earlier," said Andrew 
Zimbalist, who studied Cuba as an economist at Smith College. "The Europeans, 
the Latin Americans, the Asians are getting a jump on us."

 Vietnam May Market Gas From Oil Wells: The government has appointed a 
consortium of foreign companies to study the feasibility of a $400-million 
project to launch a potentially sizable offshore gas industry, officials said. 
British Gas, Japan's Mitsui & Co. and TransCanada PipeLines have won exclusive 
rights, in partnership with the state oil firm PetroVietnam, to conduct the 
study on opening the gas market. If accepted, they would form a joint venture 
to begin the first major project using gas -- currently being burned off -- 
from oil wells at the Bach Ho (White Tiger) field in the South China Sea, 
Vietnam's only field pumping crude.

 Court Bars Bank Takeover of Thrift: The British High Court blocked Lloyds 
Bank's proposed $2.66-billion takeover of Cheltenham & Gloucester Building 
Society, thus stopping what would have been the first merger of a British bank 
and thrift.The court ruled that Lloyds' plan to give cash payments to people 
holding accounts with Cheltenham & Gloucester for less than two years violated 
the Building Societies Act of 1986, which governs the thrift industry. The new 
bank would have garnered about 7% of home mortgage lending and become Britain's 
fourth-largest lender. It was the second time a Lloyds attempt to expand via a 
takeover has been thwarted. The first, in 1991, was its ill-fated bid for 
Midland Bank.

expensive city is Buenos Aires, followed by Hong Kong, Taipei, Zurich and 
Geneva. Prices are lowest in Harare, Zimbabwe. The Swiss study found that cost 
differences between Japan and cities elsewhere had been exaggerated by the

GROUP OF INVESTORS TO BUY STOCK IN ADVANTAGE LIFE; DEAL: ITS LEADER, 
ENTREPRENEUR CARL BOZZO, HOPES TO TURN AROUND THE IRVINE MAKER OF HEALTH AND 
BEAUTY PRODUCTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An investor group led by entrepreneur Carl E. Bozzo has agreed to buy 3 
million shares of stock in Advantage Life Products Inc., a maker of health and 
beauty products. 
</P>
<P>
 Bozzo, a former dentist who turned around an ailing dental health maintenance 
group and sold it to Sacramento-based Foundation Health Corp. in 1991, said he 
wants to be a player in the health care business again.  
</P>
<P>
 He will serve as chairman and chief executive of Advantage Life Products, and 
his group of investors will be entitled to two seats on the company's board. 
</P>
<P>
 Bozzo said details of the transaction, such as the price of the shares, are 
yet to be worked out. He said his investor group would own about 15% of the 
stock and infuse about $1 million into the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Bozzo, a Corona del Mar resident, took over as chief executive at National 
Health Care Systems Inc. in 1986. The ailing company was being sued by 
shareholders, had four employees and was in financial difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he sold the company in 1991 to a larger health maintenance 
organization, it had 120 employees and $20 million in annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Advantage Life, best known for its use of infomercials to sell its beauty 
products, needs the help. The company fired its chief executive, Michael 
Ackerman, in March. He had served less than eight months. 
</P>
<P>
 The company reported a loss of $697,938, or 7 cents a share, for its latest 
fiscal quarter, compared to a loss of $449,348, or 7 cents a share, for the 
same period a year earlier. Revenue was $271,136, up from $158,927. 
</P>
<P>
 Bozzo said he hoped to use his turnaround skills again with Advantage Life. 
President Don Danks said he expects to remain with the company and welcomes the 
contributions of Bozzo. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has nine employees, down from a peak of about 30 in 1989. Bozzo 
said he hopes to reach a final agreement with Advantage Life within 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's stock closed at 50 cents a share, up 6 1/4 cents, in Wednesday's 
Nasdaq trading. Advantage Life Products at a Glance

 Toshiba America Inc.'s highest-ranking Japanese executive in Orange County is 
returning to Japan as part of a management shuffle, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-chairman Taizo Nishimuro was responsible for orchestrating strategic 
high-tech alliances such as a key agreement to build an interactive TV network 
with media giant Time Warner Inc. The network is being tested in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Nishimuro will become a senior vice president for Toshiba Corp. in Tokyo with 
responsibility for Toshiba's worldwide sales of personal computers, 
televisions, audio products and copiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nishimuro's new position is a promotion. His previous corporate title was vice 
president. Effective June 29, Nishimuro will be succeeded by Hitoshi Ohashi, 
president of Toshiba America's consumer products unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Takeshi Okatomi will replace Tadao Taguchi as chairman of Toshiba 
America Inc., a New York-based umbrella group that oversees Toshiba's 
subsidiaries in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Toshiba America's operations in Orange County, which range from manufacturing 
laptop computers to selling office equipment and computer chips, report to the 
New York-based group. In total, the group has 7,500 employees, including about 
2,000 in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Okatomi is now executive vice president and group executive of Toshiba Corp.'s

FRENCH REGULATORS WARN EURO DISNEY INVESTORS NOT TO EXPECT PROFIT UNTIL '96

 Attendance is still falling at Euro Disneyland, and French stock market 
regulators issued a rare warning to shareholders Wednesday as park officials 
forecast more losses. 
</P>
<P>
 At an extraordinary meeting where they approved a financial rescue plan, 
shareholders heard a litany of bad news but were told to expect improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 The park, which opened in April, 1992, welcomed 10.5 million visitors in its 
first year, 500,000 under expectations. In the second year, the figure fell to 
9.8 million and is well below that pace now, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Philippe Bourguignon said losses for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 
should be lower than last year's deficit of $900 million. But he offered no 
firm projections. 
</P>
<P>
 The rescue plan centers on a $1-billion rights issue. Euro Disney intends to 
offer current investors seven new shares for every two held and expects to 
price the new stock at $1.75 a share. The exact price will be determined after 
negotiations with underwriters, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Euro Disney stock traded Wednesday at about $6.40 a share on the Paris Bourse. 
The stock traded as high as $28 in early 1992 but fell to $4.16 last November 
as the park announced huge losses. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rare move, Paris securities regulators attached a warning to the rights 
issue prospectus stating that the company is not expected to show a profit 
before fiscal 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after restructuring, Euro Disney will have $2.8 billion of consolidated 
debt, or nearly triple shareholder equity. The restructuring plan, agreed to 
between Euro Disney and 61 creditor banks in March, includes forgiveness on 
interest payments and some fees and royalties by Walt Disney Co., which owns 
49% of the stock.

TANTALIZING; OLD PRODUCTS PALE IN COMPARISON WITH IMPROVED FORMULAS THAT 
REFLECT THE DESIRE TO LOOK SUN-KISSED WITHOUT RISK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 Self-tanning products first came on the market more than 20 years ago, 
promising consumers they could have a fast tan without baking in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet a dark cloud soon shadowed those early self-tanners: Instead of looking 
natural, the tans-from-a-tube sometimes looked streaky. Even worse, the lotions 
turned some fair-skinned people an unflattering shade of orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Self-tanning products have finally found their place in the sun. In recent 
years improved formulas have greatly reduced the products' unsightly side 
effects. In addition, a growing awareness of the sun's damaging effect on skin 
has caused many consumers to take a second look at self-tanners as an 
alternative to pale skin. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales figures reflect the shift in tanning attitudes. Fifteen years ago, 
suntan oils and lotions accounted for 65% to 75% of sun-related product sales, 
according to Clinique Laboratories Inc. Today sun blocks with a sun protection 
factor of 15 or higher comprise 65% of the market. Sales of self-tanning 
products alone jumped 50% in 1992 and 20% in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public has become more educated about sun damage -- everybody's trying to 
avoid it," says Billur Wallerich, spokeswoman for Neiman Marcus in Fashion 
Island Newport Beach. "The next best thing to a (natural) healthy glow is to 
use self-tanning products." 
</P>
<P>
 While they worry about wrinkles and skin cancer, men and women still want a 
little color. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not seeing the over-exposed tans that were popular in the '50s and 
'60s, but still, a touch of sun makes you look healthy," Wallerich says. "We do 
not want to look pale in our bare summer clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all major cosmetic companies now have their version of a self-tanner on 
the market, and they report brisk sales. Estee Lauder's Self-Action SuperTan 
(about $25) has been so hot, the company reports having trouble keeping it in 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Clinique introduced its Self-Tanning Formula in 1988, the product has 
been the No. 1 seller among all of its sun-related product -- even eclipsing 
its sunscreens. (A four-ounce bottle with a pump spray is $12.50.) 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a year-round item," says Paige Ferguson, director of product development 
for treatment, men's and fragrance at Clinique in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Summer or winter, women will use a self-tanner when they're wearing something 
revealing like a strapless gown. Sales of self-tanners do jump in late spring, 
when people are first putting on shorts and swimsuits and getting ready for 
summer, Ferguson says. 
</P>
<P>
 To entice buyers to their product, cosmetic companies offer self-tanners in 
different user-friendly formulas. There are self-tanning creams, sprays, gels 
and mousses, says Robin Silber, cosmetic treatment buyer for Nordstrom in 
Orange County. Gels dry quicker, while sprays make it easier to cover 
hard-to-reach places, but which product one picks is simply a matter of 
personal preference. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers can also choose from different depths of color, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can have your choice of fair, medium or dark," Silber says. "They've 
really refined the quality of self-tanners to make application easier and to 
make the color more natural." 
</P>
<P>
 One other improvement: 
</P>
<P>
 "The smell used to be really bad," she says. "They've put a blocker in it" so 
consumers won't be turned off by the odor. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the name or slick packaging, all self-tanners contain a tanning 
agent called dihydroxyacetone -- the same ingredient found in the early 
formulas such as Q.T. and Man Tan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The material itself is colorless, but when you put it on it turns the skin a 
brown color," says John Wenninger, director of cosmetic chemistry for the 
Cosmetic Toiletry and Fragrance Assn. in Washington, D.C. "The color varies 
with skin types." 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists speculate the color is caused by a reaction of DHA with the skin's 
protein on the outer layers of the skin, Wenninger says. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference between the old products and the new is the concentration of 
other ingredients. The early products were watery, so they tended to streak and 
run more, Wenninger says. 
</P>
<P>
 While the first formulas might have contained 20% of DHA, today's products 
such as Clinique's Self-Tanning Formula have only about 5% DHA, Ferguson says. 
That helps avoid an orangish cast or uneven color. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lower levels are positioned for more fair skin," Ferguson says. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how natural the self-tan looks can depend on how one applies the product. 
</P>
<P>
 Before rubbing it all over, consumers should put a small amount on the inside 
of their forearm then wait a couple of hours to see if the final color is 
acceptable, Wenninger says. Even with the new formulas, a few people have still 
complained of an orangish tone -- a problem probably related to their skin 
types, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be more rare, but it still can happen," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Other tips from Estee Lauder for applying a self-tanning product: 
</P>
<P>
 * Cleanse and exfoliate the skin thoroughly to remove dead skin cells. The tan 
will be smoother and last longer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wash the hands vigorously immediately after applying to avoid "tan palms." 
</P>
<P>
 * Apply the products lightly to the knuckles, knees or elbows -- areas where 
there are fine, tiny lines that tend to absorb more cream and turn darker. 
</P>
<P>
 Self-tanners take about two to three hours to work. The artificial tans last 
three or four days, about as long as a natural tan, before the color wears off 
as the skin naturally turns over its top layer of dead cells. The tans do not 
wash off. 
</P>
<P>
 A last word of caution: Although the skin looks tan, it hasn't built up the 
kind of resistance to sunburn that occurs with actual sun exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a sunscreen, "you'll burn straight through," Wenninger says.

BY DESIGN; SMILE WHEN YOU SAY THAT; TRENDS: BRACE YOURSELF FOR THE REVOLUTION. 
COLORFUL RETAINERS WITH MESSAGES AND HOBBY ICONS (WORN TO KEEP TEETH IN LINE) 
ENCOURAGE KIDS AND ADULTS TO OPEN WIDE.

 Some might find it hard to swallow, but retainers -- yes, those ugly acrylic 
things that stick to the roof of your mouth and hold your straightened teeth in 
place -- are making fashion statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Once retainers were made of plain, gum-colored plastic. Now they come in 
colors such as purple, lime and orange as well as glow-in-the-dark and neon 
shades. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've even had some done in school colors. I'm a USC alum, and I've done 
several USC retainers," says Steven Wynn, a Newport Beach orthodontist. 
</P>
<P>
 Retainers can also be personalized with decals that are embedded in the 
transparent acrylic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done American flags, stripes, checks and sparkles. Any kind of sticker 
can be incorporated in the design," Wynn says. "Some people want stickers of 
their favorite kind of dog. One girl wanted a picture of a Dalmatian." 
</P>
<P>
 Some patients have had retainers printed with a "No Smoking" sign. Others have 
included their names and phone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe if you lost your retainer someone could call you," Wynn says. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Magnusen, owner and operator of Magnusen Orthodontic Lab in Costa Mesa, 
has produced retainers bearing stars, hearts and Ninja Turtles. One design 
looks like a slice of watermelon -- black seeds on a pink and green background. 
Another retainer comes in green Army fatigues print, "like in Desert Storm," 
Magnusen says. 
</P>
<P>
 There are retainers to promote favorite hobbies. In Orange County, surfing 
stickers are hot. So are sports motifs such as baseball and basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done little baseball bats," says Tami Cook, owner and operator of Stark 
Orthodontic Laboratory in Laguna Beach. "Or we do musical notes." 
</P>
<P>
 While it's difficult to create a detailed picture on a piece of acrylic, lab 
technicians occasionally try their hand at turning retainers into warped works 
of art. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone who works for me made a twilight scene with a sunset and a moon 
coming up," Cook says. 
</P>
<P>
 Such artistry can't be appreciated unless the patient opens wide, but that 
doesn't stop both children and adults from wanting customized retainers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd be surprised. Adults get colored retainers just as often as kids, but 
they'll go with a toned-down color," Wynn says. "Kids will get neon or black. 
Believe it or not, black is very popular." 
</P>
<P>
 Personalized retainers (and other orthodontic appliances designed to keep the 
teeth in line) also serve a purpose -- of sorts. The colorful designs encourage 
kids to wear them more often, Cook says. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's another appetizing thought: If there are other members of the household 
wearing retainers, Cook says they are less likely to accidentally put someone 
else's retainer in their mouth.

 Think soccer and more than likely Tiffany & Co. is not the first name that 
comes to mind. But don't exclude the legendary jewelry maker from the game. 
After all, futball- loving customers of their international boutiques haven't. 
Even before the World-Cup hype, Tiffany's carried signature sterling silver 
accessories such as cuff links ($85), ballpoint pens ($80) and screwball key 
rings ($50 to $60) tipped with a soccer ball or cleat, left. "Our clients find 
them novel," notes spokeswoman Jo Ellen Qualls. "We find we're getting requests 
for extensions to the line." 
</P>
<P>
 Dog on the Sidelines 
</P>
<P>
 It wouldn't be an Event without the official merchandise. Licensed World Cup 
'94 product is certainly "making soccer history" as the logo says, but so far 
it's at the register. Tees ($19), shorts ($20), fanny packs ($15) and gear bags 
($16) are moving faster as the games near, report managers at county Oshman's 
Sporting Goods stores. At Oshman's in MainPlace/Santa Ana, official WC '94 
watches ($30) don't stay in stock long, says assistant manager Adam Fleischer. 
"We've been seeing more people -- especially young adults -- demanding anything 
World Cup," he says. The only loser, he adds, is anything with the mascot. 
"People aren't dying for the dog." 
</P>
<P>
 A Throw In 
</P>
<P>
 Licensees aren't the only ones benefiting from World Cup madness. Rob 
Claiborne, the Faconnable buyer for all Orange County Nordstrom stores, is 
seeing "tremendous response" for the French label's soccer detailed sportswear. 
Nordie men are clamoring for T-shirts ($19.50), sweat shirts ($65) and sweat 
pants ($60) saluting their favorite world sport. The hottest number is a jersey 
($155), featured this month in a nationwide campaign in GQ and Esquire. 
"Customers are getting more excited now. They want a souvenir of the year, a 
collector's piece. They've even stopped saying 'soccer' for 'football,' " quips 
Claiborne. 
</P>
<P>
 Fishy Feet 
</P>
<P>
 Forwards on the U.S. and German teams will appear to be working magic on the 
field when they kick the ball one way and it goes another. But there's no 
trickery at work here, just technology courtesy of Adidas' new Predator shoe 
($150). It's all the buzz in the soccer community, says Fred Nassirkhani, owner 
of the Soccer Shoppe in Mission Viejo. Available only at soccer equipment 
retailers, the shoe, above, is already finding fans among AYSO player's feet in 
South County. Fish-like fins increase the grip between the shoe and ball for 
greater control and spin when shooting and passing. "It looks strange, but it 
works great," Nassirkhani says.

SHE SAID / HE SAID: BY DESIGN; FRAMING THE ARGUMENTS FOR GLASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 F orget the four-eyes jokes. Coordinated eye wear has the fashion-minded 
buying one, two, three and more pairs of glasses. The point: an eye on variety, 
enough looks to launch several fashion identities. We're all for accessorizing 
ourselves to the nth, but just how many eyeglasses does one person need? (Or 
want?)  
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Well, here comes another one of those uncomfy confessions. I have a thing 
for glasses, especially shades. I have a drawer full of them -- purple, 
tortoise, brass, red, turquoise, black, you name the frame colors. 
</P>
<P>
 I also have about seven pairs of regular glasses -- several with black frames, 
a pair that combines red with black, another that combines blue with pink. 
</P>
<P>
 I've never walked out the door sans shades (no Garbo jokes please; I have very 
sensitive eyes, and consequently, virtually no crow's feet). And now that I can 
barely see across a room, I love having a bunch of eye-looks to wear inside. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: This is another one of those fashion territories, I think, where women can 
get away with being expansive (and expensive) and men generally can't. If a 
woman buys three pairs of glasses to go with the paint job on her sports car, 
she's fashion-conscious. If a man does it, he's a vain pretty boy. 
</P>
<P>
 No complaints, though. I have two pairs of faithful face-hiders -- Ray-Ban 
aviators and a pair of conservative square gold-rimmed everyday corrective 
glasses -- and so far nobody's told me I look like a blowfish or that I ought 
to seriously consider wearing a ski mask full time. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: According to Pearle Vision, an eye-wear retailer out of Dallas, there are 
some interesting eye-frame trends afoot. Metal frames with matte finishes, for 
one. This look complements natural tailoring styles and neutral tones. 
</P>
<P>
 Another hot look: tortoise color treatments such as calico, leopard and amber 
(gone are the days of the traditional thick plastic tortoise frame in single 
colors). 
</P>
<P>
 But, believe it or not, basic black is still the most popular choice for 
frames. As they become a status accessory, frames are meant to be noticed. And 
what is more defining or dramatic than black? 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Whether you want to look like Jayne Mansfield or Don Knotts, one thing's 
certain: eventually you're probably going to have to make an eye-wear choice. 
According to a study by the Optical Industry Assn., 94% of all United States 
residents over the age of 45 wear some sort of corrective eye wear. This means 
that you're likely going to be looking through a pair of lenses for quite a few 
years, so you'd better be thoroughly happy with whatever option you pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Something to consider: If you decide on contact lenses, you won't look one bit 
different, no better or worse, unless you get those tinted things that make 
nearly everyone who wears them look vaguely reptilian. If, however, you opt for 
glasses, unless you go for something freakishly retro, you're going to look 
smarter. In the right glasses, you'll look like you work at Caltech. Honest. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Vaguely reptilian, eh? Well said. These days, when I find myself going 
gaga over someone's eye color, I stop and ask myself: true or false? The answer 
is usually false. Being a nosy reporter-type, I always compliment them on their 
eyes, then, very carefully, find out what their real eye color is. 
</P>
<P>
 One stylish society maven wore emerald contacts over her coffee-colored orbs 
to a splashy gala. Why did she change her soulful browns to bright green? To 
match her emerald taffeta party frock, of course. Her glittering emerald 
necklace and earrings completed the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Contacts have always given me the willies. Imagine willingly poking 
something straight into your eye. I wouldn't do it on a bet, much less to match 
my evening duds. Yeeeeeecchh!! 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, with glasses a whole new repertoire of facial expressions opens up 
for you. Two of the best: 1) peering quizzically over the tops of the lenses 
when somebody says something stupid and 2) removing the glasses entirely in a 
theatrical motion, leaning forward and staring in utter disbelief when somebody 
says something REALLY stupid. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: For sheer style-power, you can't beat the look of huge sunglasses, a la 
our late beloved Jackie O. Her quiet elegance was magnified by the mystery she 
projected behind her owl-like shades. She took a practical accessory, 
exaggerated the look and made fashion history. And it was all about her 
penchant for privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a style lesson there. Better to develop your own look with a pair or 
two of wisely chosen eyeglasses than follow a trend for trend's sake. My two 
choices: basic black accented with gold and classic tortoise shell. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: That's why I'm such a fan of Ray-Bans. Their Wayfarer model has been on 
people's faces for many a year and has even enjoyed a resurgence of popularity 
in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The one I love, though, is their large-size aviator style, favorite of fighter 
jock wanna-bes everywhere. They exemplify the two golden traits of any piece of 
eye wear: They look like a million and work even better than that. You can 
almost watch an eclipse of the sun through them, and they can make Billy 
Crystal look like Chuck Yeager. 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem: They'll bend if you fall face first into the snow while 
skiing. So better to stick to strafing Saddam Hussein's patio in your F-15.

BEHIND THE SCENES: MAKING WAVES ON SOLID GROUND 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Say ball and what usually comes to mind are socialites amid sophisticated 
revelry or, at the very least, Cinderella. But when the ball involves a bunch 
of beach-bred dudes, spike all expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 In this high society, superiority is determined by who dominates the waves, 
and it's the boards that have become sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
 In the name of a good cause and good fun, members of the surf industry suited 
up for the fifth annual Waterman's Ball at the California Scenario Sculpture 
Garden in Costa Mesa on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Surf Industry Manufacturers Assn., the event drew hundreds of 
surf designers, company owners, artists and distributors, as well as supporters 
of the Surfrider Foundation, American Oceans Campaign and the Orange County 
Marine Institute, which benefited from the gala.  
</P>
<P>
 The code was creative black tie, but even that was a stretch for some, such as 
Quiksilver VP Danny Kwock who attended in a cotton aloha shirt and jeans. It 
was, he said, in honor of filmmaker Bruce ("The Endless Summer") Brown, who 
received the Waterman Achievement Award that night. 
</P>
<P>
 Glass slippers? 
</P>
<P>
 Try Converse sneakers, sports sandals and even thongs paired with pin-stripe 
suits and tuxedos. Katin co-owner Bill Sharp and Surfer magazine artist Joe 
McElroy hot-footed it in red suede creepers. 
</P>
<P>
 McElroy also shared World Jungle owner Jack Denny's penchant for polyester -- 
in a sickly shade of chocolate. Dudes also got the opportunity to let loose by 
wrapping up in sarongs, both in primitive prints and in classier black satin. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the women, outrageous black cocktail dresses in sheers and detailed 
with cutouts competed for attention with barely-there baby dolls in whites and 
metallics. There was also a barrage of ocean blue sequins and Barbie get-ups.  
</P>
<P>
 The Hawaiian print tux accouterments and fresh flower leis aside, the best 
accessory of the night was attached to display artist Raggs Adams suit jacket 
lapel: a sticker that read simply "Cool Guy." ROSE APODACA JONES

FAUX PAS REPORT: A FITTING BRACE TO THE FINISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 How does a guy make his drab business uniform look a little stylish? The 
easiest way is to throw out the belt and strap on a pair of suspenders or 
braces. But while braces may look great when a man is standing or walking 
around, if they're stretched out and ill-fitting, they'll be twisted or loose 
around the shoulders when he's sitting. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's a pair you really like, they can be altered," says Laura Downing of 
Laura Downing in Laguna Beach. "A good tailor can discreetly attach a new piece 
of elastic in the back to keep your suspenders tight at all times." 
</P>
<P>
 Make sure your braces fit between your neck and shoulders, and if you're new 
to suspenders, don't make that grave faux pas that nearly every neophyte does 
at some point -- walk into the office with not only your braces on, but a belt 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Cattle drive: Face it, East Coast transplants -- this is the West, the place 
where men and women can get away with cowboy boots nearly anywhere at any time. 
But we know there's sometimes a legitimate reason you've got your noses in the 
air -- cheap new boots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually the odor is determined by the tanning process," says Tom Graffio of 
Factotum Shoe & Luggage Repair in Laguna Beach. "When cowboy boots were work 
boots, it didn't matter if they smelled. Now that they're in fashion, it does." 
</P>
<P>
 In general, the better the boot, the more extensive the tanning process and 
the less gamy odor the boot gives off. If you find that strangers are asking 
you what dude ranch you just came back from, take the boots back to the store 
and complain, or consult a leather repair shop, because the problem could also 
be mildew. 
</P>
<P>
 Tie spy: The time has come to give it up. We're talking about those awful fish 
ties, especially the King salmon ones that look like they were bought at a gift 
shop in Spokane. 
</P>
<P>
 "That Northwest, rugged look is still in style, which is probably why some 
guys are hanging on to fish ties," says fashion buyer Bill Rigioni of 
Huntington Beach. "It's fine if you want to wear it to an off-beat party, but 
the fad has pretty much died. It's like you're telling a joke everyone's 
already heard." 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't want to give up on seafood neckwear, try one of the more 
fashionable ties with outdoorsy prints, such as small shells, pelicans and, 
yes, salmon.

NOT ALL SWIMSUITS ARE EQUAL; SHOPPING: BEFORE YOU BUY, CONSIDER YOUR PLANS AND 
YOUR NEED FOR STYLISH FASHION VERSUS SMART FUNCTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Swimsuits, like shoes, come in several types -- stylish or sensible, pretty or 
practical. 
</P>
<P>
 So before you buy, inventory your needs for fashion versus function. Does your 
idea of the perfect beach day include nothing more challenging than poolside 
lounging? At some hangouts in Newport Beach or Palm Beach, the water is merely 
incidental to the real action -- seeing and being seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, you might be into serious swimming, and your flashiest accessory 
is a pair of fins or swim goggles. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are hundreds of swimsuit companies, and basically you're looking at 
suits that are water-efficient versus those meant for lounging at the beach in 
Hawaii," says Lois Fahey, owner of Swim 'N Things, a Denver swimwear store. "So 
we try to ask customers if they're looking for something to be active in or a 
fashion statement. Your usage of the suit will dictate what's best for you." 
</P>
<P>
 First, think fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
 At Speedo Athletic stores, the key fabrication for active women bent on 
aquatic speed is nylon-Lycra. That combo offers the least resistance and isn't 
quite as heavy as cotton, which soaks up more water, according to a Speedo 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 On the fashion front, this season's trendiest swimwear is cut from materials 
typically used for ready-to-wear, such as crushed velvet, metallics and 
crochet. Elegant enough to sail straight from pool to cocktail party. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is, velvet swimsuits are more durable than you might think, says 
Michelle Boylan. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have a misconception of what velvet swimsuits really are. They're 
actually made of nylon and Lycra," says Boylan, vice president of Beach Patrol, 
a swimwear manufacturer based in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The velvet is a product of a brushed finishing process of the nylon-Lycra. 
True velvet would have cotton or silk, so it's actually faux velvet." 
</P>
<P>
 Beach Patrol offers velvet maillots and bikinis in black, forest green, 
burgundy and plaids, accented with gold-tone details. They sell for about $60 
at department stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're made for a poolside party atmosphere, and they can go out at night if 
you add a chiffon flared skirt or a pair of jeans," Boylan says. "We see our 
swimsuits as bodysuits functioning as day-to-nightwear." 
</P>
<P>
 Or dress up in a metallic swimsuit. For trend worshipers, precious metals 
continue to shine bright in gold, silver, bronze and pewter -- even though some 
metallics work double time as conductors that reflect the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, metallic suits are your ticket to the cutting edge of poolside 
perfection. 
</P>
<P>
 "Silver is the most important and versatile color," Boylan says. "Just add 
silver lace-up strappy pumps or ankle-tie pumps and a chiffon sarong." Plus 
Hollywood shades, bold bangles and turban for that glamour girl look. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're bent on looking like a million-dollar mermaid, try a suit that 
recalls the glitz of bygone Hollywood days. Among the retro styles are suits 
with high-banded waists and teeny skirts. "Very flirty and fun," Boylan says. 
</P>
<P>
 But not the most water-worthy, according to Fahey of Swim 'N Things. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buying a skirted swimsuit is the most common mistake if you're going to be 
active in the water, because the water bubbles under it and the skirt gets in 
your way," Fahey says. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're looking for a water-efficient suit, skip the ruffles, the gathers, 
the skirt. You just want something as sleek as possible for the least amount of 
drag in the water." 
</P>
<P>
 If tracking down a wearer-friendly suit is your goal, a one-piece suit scores 
for athletic appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 At Speedo Athletic stores, the one-piece S-2000 is one of the most popular 
high-performance suits. With high neck and high-cut shoulder and leg styling, 
the body-hugging style prevents drag due to water seepage. About $65 to $79, 
depending on color and print. 
</P>
<P>
 Or try a "workout bikini," Fahey says. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyr offers a workout-worthy nylon-Lycra bikini with athletic sports-bra top 
with T-back straps, plus high drawstring bottom. The line runs about $50 to 
$65, in reversible solids and prints. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thing is they hug the body real well and are very secure for 
activity," Fahey says. "So you won't lose your bathing suit no matter what 
you're doing."

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: POOL HALLS GO UPSCALE AND TRENDY FOR THE '90S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Kids are being dropped off at pool halls these days," a friend told me a 
while back. "It's now considered to be a safe, wholesome environment for young 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure," I said, "and parents are probably encouraging the little ones to start 
their own bookmaking businesses as a way to earn extra money after school. And 
they're picking the darlings up at the gate when they play hooky, so the kids 
won't tire themselves out running from the truant officer." 
</P>
<P>
 My friend just rolled his eyes and suggested that I might be trapped in a 
cultural vacuum, a situation made worse by my reluctance to watch any movie 
made after 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 A features editor with a popular culture deficiency is like a fisherman with 
seasickness, a landscaper with agoraphobia or a doctor with typhus. 
</P>
<P>
 I decided that it was time to turn away from Robert Preston's warnings in "The 
Music Man" and instead tune into Tom Cruise and Paul Newman in "The Color of 
Money." Not knowing a cue ball from a bowling bowl, I sent staff writer and 
wannabe pool shark Jeff Meyers to investigate the state of today's pool halls. 
</P>
<P>
 After an odyssey to a dozen county establishments, Meyers confirmed my 
friend's report and also glommed another phenomenon: Pool halls have gone 
uptown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ventura County has a few toney places with flowers on the bar, no-smoking 
signs on the wall, rock on the CD and clean bathrooms," Meyers said. "They 
attract 20- and 30-year-olds, sell wine and offer a conducive dating 
environment, games of pool serving as a backdrop for the ritual." 
</P>
<P>
 In our centerpiece, Meyers describes several new pool halls in the county, but 
traditionalists will be happy to note that Meyers also found a Santa Paula pool 
hall frozen in the year 1927 -- a musty, nostalgic joint with original tables. 
</P>
<P>
 "I half expected to see Fast Eddie Felson hustling 9-ball at a back table," 
Meyers said. "It reminded me of places where I spent too much time and 
allowance as a kid and lost to a lot of guys named Nicky." 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers spent his Huck Finn years on Long Island and acquired the nom de pool 
of "Long Island Ice T." He was known for talking a better game than he played, 
and his talking was not all that hot. In the last few years, he has become 
proficient playing on a miniature pool table in his den. 
</P>
<P>
 Visiting county pool halls with real tables gave him a chance to sharpen his 
game. "It's amazing how fast it all comes back," Meyers said. "Talc the palms. 
Dust the tip. Rack 'em and break. Long Island Ice T rides again." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, his kids have already grown up. 
</P>
<P>
 Plenty of local children will be outside this weekend, according to Jane 
Hulse, our For the Kids columnist. They will be part of the Children's 
Celebration of the Arts Festival at Mission Park in Ventura on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Local artists and entertainers will offer free workshops in such activities as 
origami, batik, Middle Eastern dance and kite making. Performers include 
storytellers, African drummers and the Ventura Klezmer Band. 
</P>
<P>
 And not a crap game in sight.

NIGHT LIFE: RUST-FREE BAND SHOWS NEW POLISH; FORMER BUENA HIGH STUDENTS HAVE 
BLOODY MARY MORNING ENJOYING INCREASING SUCCESS BY PLAYING DANCEABLE BACK-ROOM 
ROCK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Named for that time-honored solution to the one-too-many problem, Bloody Mary 
Morning will be making its Bombay Bar & Grill debut on a competitive Friday 
night in the Poinsettia City. Just a few blocks away at the Ventura Theatre 
it's going to be the long-awaited Lion I's CD release party. But BMM has fans, 
mostly dress-to-impress east Ventura types, as does the venue itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bombay is one of those places where a crowd would show up even if a chain 
saw polka concert were scheduled. The club has two bands on the weekends, a 
relatively tame one up front by the door, with the rockers in the back Oasis 
Room. Bloody Mary Morning is definitely a back room band. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll do OK because we have a different crowd than Lion I's does," 
guitarist Ryan Denger said. "We've always had good loyal fans. They're mostly 
just people we've known from school. But they tell a friend, then they tell a 
friend, and we usually end up with a crowd. And also, Lion I's is having a 
private party at Bombay after their CD release party, so the place should be 
packed." 
</P>
<P>
 Once upon a time, BMM was Rust, formed back in the late '80s when the band 
members were at Buena High School. After more personnel changes than the Dodger 
bullpen, Rust finally broke up. Denger was in Rust along with singer and tattoo 
collector Chad Turner and bass player John Young. Rhythm guitar player Chris 
Cummings was in an earlier version of Rust before signing on with BMM. Ephram 
Ashton became the drummer, after his predecessor moved to Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 "This group is a lot more versatile than Rust," said Denger. "We do a few Rust 
songs, but we just play music that comes from the soul. We hardly know the 
names of the chords, but if it sounds good, we do it. I guess it's typical 
party music." 
</P>
<P>
 At a gig last weekend at Garfields Bar & Grill in Ventura, the place was 
virtually empty until 10:30 p.m., when the doors burst open and the clients 
came pouring in. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had over 200 people in and out of that place," said Denger. "That's sort 
of our home venue; they love us there." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently they're already loved at Bombay, as well; BMM joins a mere handful 
of local bands that are booked to play original rock there. There's Lion I's, 
Ska Daddyz, and now a pair of Santa Barbara bands -- Spencer the Gardener and 
Tao Jonz -- have joined the rotation. So five bands keeps things fairly 
predictable, but "danceable" is the key word here. 
</P>
<P>
 "People talk, that's how we get our gigs," said Denger. "They call me. I've 
yet to try to get us a gig anywhere. We want to play all the time, take short 
breaks, and make people dance." 
</P>
<P>
 BMM intends to play through June then take July off, according to the 
guitarist. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to learn more songs. Right now, we've got about 20 originals, plus a 
couple of covers," said Denger. "We need to know about 30 to 35 songs so we 
won't need to be an opening band anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 It may be rock star a go-go at night, but the rest of the time, it's the 
dreaded day job for everyone. The drummer, for example, is a painter. But 
taking the cake in the I-Suffer-For-Art category is the singer. Turner works in 
the oil fields for his dad in Bakersfield, then drives 1 1/2 hours each way to 
practice, then back again for the weekend gigs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's dedicated," said Denger. "He drives all this way, but he does it because 
we're all friends. This is nothing. I'm used to working on five hours sleep. 
But being friends is what keeps us all together." Details

SOUNDS: MUSICAL MIX ON TAP AT OAKLEAF FESTIVAL; POPULAR ALBUM MUSICIAN CHARLIE 
BISHARAT TEAMS UP WITH VOCALIST KENNY RANKIN IN ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING 
OFFERINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 No one will accuse the Oakleaf Festival of pushing out into experimental or 
esoteric areas. The annual festival, taking place this weekend in Thousand Oaks 
and Westlake, heads straight down the cultural middle in terms of its 
programming, offering accessible music at affordable prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening on Friday, the North Wind Quintet promises "audience-friendly" chamber 
music. Actress/singer Lainie Kazan headlines the Saturday night show, and 
Sunday in the park brings the agreeable sounds of dixieland and contemporary 
jazz, from Dwight Kennedy and the New Orleans Dixie Kings and Kilauea, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the more promising acts on the festival roster is violinist Charlie 
Bisharat, who will bring his band to town in a concert with veteran 
singer-songwriter Kenny Rankin. 
</P>
<P>
 Bisharat is a name familiar to anyone who pays attention to album credits. 
He's part of that population of musicians who has long been active on the 
periphery, working with the heavy hitters of the new age world -- Shadowfax, 
Kitaro, Yanni, and, of late, keyboardist and "Entertainment Tonight" host John 
Tesh. 
</P>
<P>
 With last fall's release of "Along the Amazon," his album on Tesch's GTS 
label, and more regular gigs under his name, Bisharat is stepping out of the 
sidelines as a leader. 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning of a recent interview, Bisharat was preparing to go into the 
studio to work on an elaborate Christmas album of Tesch's involving a 40-piece 
string section. In August, Tesh is planning to stage a live video/concert 
performance at the Red Rock outdoor amphitheater in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's never a dull moment with him," Bisharat says of Tesh. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he started out studying classical violin as a child, Bisharat was 
inclined toward following in the footsteps of his father, a doctor. He got a 
biology degree from USC and was trying to get into medical school. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time I got to college, I was burned out on the violin. I thought 'I 
can't take it anymore.' Later on, I decided I would try it more from a jazz 
side, with improv, and do more writing. That's when I was contacted by 
Shadowfax." 
</P>
<P>
 Joining the already established Shadowfax in 1985 was a turning point for 
Bisharat, who immediately jumped from humble local gigs to global touring and a 
Grammy in 1989. Later, he fell into lucrative studio work. 
</P>
<P>
 Making his own album was an inevitable, if delayed, process. After scouting 
for a record deal, Bisharat wound up recording at Tesch's own home studio, and 
for Tesh's label. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so much of a lower-key situation," he said. "I could take my time, and 
no one was breathing down my neck. He let me hire all the guys I thought would 
be appropriate for the project -- John Patitucci, Don Grusin, a couple of guys 
from the Yellowjackets, Strunz and Farah, one of the guys from Shadowfax. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be able to have all those guys come and play with me was like a lifetime 
dream. I never thought I'd meet these guys, let alone play with them." 
</P>
<P>
 He also used Yes vocalist Jon Anderson on the title track, the one vocal tune. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave him a demo of the tune, and he said, 'That's a lovely voice. Who's 
that?' I said, 'That's just me, giving you an idea of how the song goes.' He 
said, 'You've got to sing it.' He insisted, so it became a duet. He wouldn't 
let me out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of going plugged or unplugged with his instrument, Bisharat goes both 
ways, partly out of necessity. "I grew up on acoustic violin, of course. But 
wanting to play in bands and in clubs, the acoustic is very difficult to 
amplify, with feedback problems. So I got into the electric about nine years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a different sound and a different approach. The acoustic is real nice 
for the jazz and the Stephane Grapelli sound, and the electric is more for the 
Jean-Luc Ponty sound, a little bit more contemporary." 
</P>
<P>
 Although based out of Woodland Hills, where he lives with his wife, Mary, and 
daughter Madison, Bisharat has also had connections with Santa Barbara, 
principally in his ongoing association with Santa Barbara bassist Randy Tico. 
Tico played on most of Bisharat's album, and the violinist will appear as part 
of Tico's Summer Solstice extravaganza on the Santa Barbara Courthouse lawn, 
June 18. 
</P>
<P>
 You can also hear Bisharat on an album by Strunz and Farah on the specialty, 
Santa Barbara-based Waterlily Acoustics label. Like most of the Waterlily 
projects, the album was recorded in a church under unusual conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't start recording until midnight," Bisharat recalled. "By the time 
we finished recording, it was three or four in the morning. It was dark. You 
can kind of hear it on the album. There's a mystery to the sound." 
</P>
<P>
 Variety keeps him out of trouble and keeps ennui at bay. "I've done a bunch of 
projects, ranging from jazz to new age to world music and rock 'n' roll," he 
said. "It's been an eclectic experience for me, especially on the instrument 
that I play. 
</P>
<P>
 "The violin is usually seen in such a traditional environment, with classical 
music and all. But I've kind of found a niche for myself in these different 
arenas of playing. It definitely keeps things lively and interesting. Every 
session is a new experience and a crazy outing." Details

 When 250 people show up to honor, talk to and get books autographed by "beat 
generation" poet Allan Ginsberg, as they did last week at the Ventura 
Bookstore, we should congratulate local booksellers like Ed Elrod who are 
providing us the opportunity to meet major literary icons. 
</P>
<P>
 The book beat continues. Local authors who are known nationally, such as 
Ventura's Kathryn Phillips, whose book "Tracking the Vanishing Frogs" has just 
been published by St. Martin's Press, and touring authors, such as Michael 
Medved ("Hollywood Vs. America"), who consider Ventura County to be good book 
country, are coming our way this week. Pencil them in. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 SATURDAY: At 11 a.m., Nancy Loman, a reading specialist who teaches child 
development at Ventura College, will discuss reading as a shared experience and 
help parents choose entertaining and enlightening books for children at Ventura 
Bookstore, 522 E. Main St. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1 p.m., Los Angeles Police Detective Paul Bishop will sign his new novel, 
"Kill Me Again," at Barnes & Noble, 4360 E. Main St., Ventura. Also at 1 p.m., 
Michael Connelly, author of "The Concrete Blonde," will be at Mysteries to Die 
For, 2940 Thousand Oaks Blvd., Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>

CENTERPIECE: BILLIARDS GETS SOME RESPECT; ONCE NEAR EXTINCTION, POOL HALLS ARE 
THRIVING BY PROMOTING THEMSELVES AS WHOLESOME PLACES. IN THE PAST YEAR, FIVE 
POOL HALLS HAVE OPENED IN THE COUNTY, MIRRORING A NATIONWIDE BOOM IN THE GAME. 
</P>

<P>
 The latest mutation in the evolution of the pool hall has occurred right here 
in Oxnard with the recent opening of the Hollywood Club, part upscale billiard 
parlor, part video arcade, and part karaoke bar. 
</P>
<P>
 In the old days, pool players had to be wary of the stranger with the 
customized stick; now, it's the guy who belts out his own arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 Once near extinction, pool halls are surviving and thriving in the lean '90s 
by diversifying. "You're not going to make it on pool alone," says Ron Kaufman, 
who owns Champion Billiards in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Pools halls have also rebounded from the depths of disrepute, growing into 
slick, safe and wholesome places. No longer scorned as corrupters of youth and 
perpetrators of sloth, these modern clubs promote themselves as posh yuppie 
hangouts or family fun playhouses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents know they can drop their kids off," says San Samaniego, owner of Hot 
Shot Family Billiards in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, five new pool halls have opened in Ventura County, mirroring 
a nationwide boom in the up-and-down life cycle of the game. A popular haven 
for mainstream Americans in the '20s, pool halls all but disappeared in the 
'50s, only to be reborn in 1961 with the release of "The Hustler." Starring 
Paul Newman as Fast Eddie Felson and Jackie Gleason as Minnesota Fats, the 
movie romanticized pool for a new generation. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'The Hustler' made my life," says Jerry Matchin, a youth in the '60s and now 
the owner of Stiix Billiards in Ventura. "You can't imagine the impact it had 
on me when Paul Newman said, 'Look at that fat man play.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Pool went through another downswing in the '70s and early '80s before once 
again being resuscitated by Fast Eddie. "The Color of Money," the 1986 sequel 
to "The Hustler" with Newman and Tom Cruise, touched off the current craze that 
has made pool America's most popular participation sport behind bowling and 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 A beneficiary of the latest boom, of course, is the pool hall. Since the movie 
sequel, the number of pool halls in the country has doubled to an estimated 
6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 While the concept of family rooms isn't new -- Norm's Q & 8 was popular in 
Ventura in the late '60s -- the upscale pool hall of the '90s is a unique 
development in the history of the game, combining the glitz of Roaring '20s 
billiard parlors with modern sensory stimuli such as CD sound systems and 
big-screen TV. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood Athletic Club set the standard for Southern California when it 
opened nearly four years ago. A Hollywood landmark with Italianate architecture 
and cavernous rooms with vaulted ceilings, the old gym underwent a $1.5-million 
metamorphosis, turning into a 45-table billiard room, piano bar with blues 
music, stylish grill, and hot spot for the Kiefer Sutherland crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've made it a first-class place where women could come in on their own and 
feel comfortable and safe," Salter says. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the five new rooms in the county, four are going after the Sutherland crowd 
and one caters to serious players: sharks and shooters who wouldn't be seen 
dead in a place with pink roses on the bar, cafe au lait on tap and oil 
paintings on the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Which begs the question: With 11 family-oriented and upscale pool halls now in 
the county, will the market support the surge? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have over-saturation," Kaufman says. "There's only so much 
demand." 
</P>
<P>
 But that hasn't happened yet. For now, county players have a lot of diversity 
and choice. If you're thinking of a night at the pool hall, here's a rundown of 
clubs that will get you off the couch and on the felt: NICHOLBY'S 
</P>
<P>
 Only 8 months old, Nicholby's has already established itself as the place 
Sutherland would hang if he ever came to Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 A 5,000-square-foot loft above an antique store, the club is a combination 
pool hall, pickup bar, night club and art gallery. The darkly lit room is warm 
and comfortable but raucous, rocking like a fraternity house. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Friday night, a couple dressed in '50s clothing jitterbugged to 
the rockabilly music of Big Sandy & the Fly-Rite Boys while hordes of young 
people -- in dress ranging from bohemian to punk -- were either listening to 
the band, sampling one of 13 beers on tap, playing video games or checking out 
the $500 price tag on a painting. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10 pool tables were in use, green islands in the darkness. It's hard 
enough to talk amid the audio overload, let alone concentrate on banking in the 
8 ball, as Ventura geologist David Ortiz learned when his game-ending attempt 
caromed wide, allowing advertising executive Cathy Cluff to come back and beat 
him on a fluke shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Slop counts at Nicholby's," Ortiz said as he racked 'em. 
</P>
<P>
 Is Nicholby's a real pool hall? Of course not. It's a social venue for pool 
duffers and proud of it. "We needed something like this in Ventura," Ortiz 
says. "There was nothing like it when we grew up." 
</P>
<P>
 Connected with the espresso bar downstairs, the pool hall offers designer 
coffees and hopes to provide food in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 One warning about Nicholby's: When a band plays, there is a cover charge, even 
if you only want to play pool. You can make up for the extra charge by taking 
advantage of the free pool hour from 6 to 7 p.m. during the week. 
</P>
<P>
 NICHOLBY'S -- 404 E. Main St., Ventura. 6 p.m. to midnight Sundays through 
Thursdays, 6 p.m. to 1 a.m. Fridays through Saturdays. $7.50 an hour. Beer and 
wine. 21 and over. 653-2320. STIIX BILLIARDS 
</P>
<P>
 Looking for a real pool hall? Stiix is the place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shooters I send to Stiix," says Champion Billiard's Ron Kaufman. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Nicholby's, Stiix is on Main Street in Ventura, but farther east, in a 
quiet part of town. Inside a storefront window, a dozen players are awash in 
white fluorescent, shooting pool on 14 top-of-the-line, well-maintained 
Brunswick Gold Crown tables. A Red Corvette is parked on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The room is clean, basic. Jukebox music playing softly doesn't overpower the 
clacking of pool balls. Original "Hustler" movie posters adorn the walls. Bud 
Lite is on tap. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Jerry Matchin watches a man in his early 20s enter from the alley. As 
soon he reaches the desk, he reverses his baseball cap, which was on backward. 
Matchin smiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "People know I don't allow hats on backward," says Matchin, who opened Stiix 
in November. "People know I run a serious room." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every night, the best player in the county plays at Stiix. That would 
be Matchin. "I don't want to brag, but I'm the best around," he says. "I'm a 
professional billiard player." 
</P>
<P>
 Better than local pool standouts Ron Marshall and Billy Houck? "Ron Marshall 
and I go at it all the time," says Matchin, who instructs at his club. "The 
difference is that he thinks he's the best; I know I'm the best. Billy is a 
very good player. All three of us could win at any time." 
</P>
<P>
 STIIX BILLIARDS -- 2520 E. Main St., Ventura. 11 a.m. to midnight Sundays 
through Thursdays, 11 to 2 a.m. Fridays through Saturdays. $4.80 an hour until 
7 p.m. and $6.90 after. Beer. 18 or over or adult supervision. 641-2020. THE Q 
CLUB 
</P>
<P>
 No chance of passersby mistaking this snazzy pool hall for a barbecue joint. 
The 23 flying saucer halogen lights floating above the 10 tables and the bar 
are bright enough for an operating room, practically requiring sunglasses. Neon 
art adds to the glare. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the stark setting, the employees are friendly, one of the gang 
types who flip beer mugs behind their backs and get to know your name. A 
bartender named Angel, wearing a tux shirt, offers you wine or one of 40 
different beers. You try to carry on a conversation with the Stones blasting 
from a CD jukebox. Except for a guy at the end of the bar laughing like a 
hyena, the atmosphere is cheerful. Troublemakers are rare. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're paying $8 an hour to play, so you're not going to screw around," 
assistant manager Stacey Jolls says. 
</P>
<P>
 The club has been open about a year -- "We were the first upscale room in this 
area," Jolls says -- and has become a popular date destination, with waiting 
lists for tables on weekends and sometimes during the week. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I love about this place is that it attracts every nationality," 
assistant manager Ronnie Marin says. "White, black, Mexican, Asian, Filipino. 
Everybody has an equal opportunity to have fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Serious shooters are referred to Stiix. "We don't care about winning or losing 
here," Marin says. 
</P>
<P>
 THE Q CLUB -- 4711 Telephone Road, Ventura. Noon to midnight Sundays through 
Thursdays and noon to 2 a.m. Fridays through Saturdays. $4 for single player 
weekdays, $5 an hour for two players or more before 7 p.m. and $8 after. Beer 
and wine. 21 and over. 644-1231. THE HOLLYWOOD CLUB 
</P>
<P>
 Karaoke aside, the club is a shining jewel of a pool hall, with 30 gleaming 
tables, brass lights and a soothing green carpet. But it's also unconventional: 
water cascades inside a glass contraption in the lobby, a 70-foot strand of 
blue neon runs along a wall, and the tables are covered with blue felt. 
</P>
<P>
 Opened in March by Sung Ho Park of Los Angeles, the Oxnard club is in a 
remodeled thrift store near Heritage Square. Aimed at families, the club has 
security guards on the premises and doesn't serve alcohol. Players under 18 are 
restricted to the video arcade unless they have permission from their parents 
to shoot pool. Smoking is not allowed on the main floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The karaoke room is upstairs along with a smoking area with six tables. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see the club as like a bowling alley where people can come in and not 
spend a lot of money," manager Ike Hwang says. 
</P>
<P>
 THE HOLLYWOOD CLUB -- 658 S. A St., Oxnard. 10 a.m. to 1 a.m. $6 an hour. No 
alcohol. 18 and younger need parents' permission to shoot pool. 487-8967. HOT 
SHOT FAMILY BILLIARDS 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth new club in the county, open eight months, Hot Shot is a family room 
with no smoking and no alcohol. Set in a corner of a Camarillo shopping center, 
the airy club with large windows provides eight tables and views of nearby 
hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Samaniego, by day a federal quality-control expert who oversees the 
Rockwell space shuttle, owns and runs the club with his wife, Solly. "I like 
playing pool," Sam says. "But the only place I could shoot was in a bar. I 
don't drink and I don't smoke, so I thought, 'How about opening a pool hall?' " 
</P>
<P>
 HOT SHOT FAMILY BILLIARDS -- 4481 Las Posas Road, Suite C, Camarillo. 11 a.m. 
to 11 p.m. Sundays through Thursdays and 11 a.m. to midnight Fridays through 
Saturdays. $6 an hour before 6 p.m. and $7.20 after. No alcohol. All ages. 
383-7210. RACK 'N' ROLL BILLIARDS 
</P>
<P>
 An example of how respectable pool halls have become, Rack 'n' Roll is 
situated just a block east of the Civic Arts Plaza, the soon-to-open cultural 
fortress in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Easily the most clubby room in the county, the 2-year-old establishment 
features 13 oak pool tables, burnished oak paneling, soft couches and brass 
railings. Attracting a young, yuppie crowd, the club is known for a party 
hearty atmosphere fueled by draught beer. 
</P>
<P>
 The $9-an-hour table charge, one of the stiffest in the county, keeps out the 
riffraff but doesn't preclude a packed house on the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "We refuse service to rowdy people," employee Justin Brewer says. "We don't 
want big-time drinkers. We're trying to be a classy pool hall." 
</P>
<P>
 RACK 'N' ROLL BILLIARDS -- 2322 E. Thousand Oaks Blvd., Thousand Oaks. 11 a.m. 
to 2 a.m. daily. $6 an hour before 7 p.m. and $9 after. Beer. All ages. 
495-7679. THE BENT CUE FAMILY BILLIARDS 
</P>
<P>
 Facing the Ventura Freeway in a Newbury Park strip mall, the 2-year-old club 
is a neat, clean family room that appeals to shooters because of its 12 
Brunswick Gold Crown tables. But it also serves as a hangout for Cal Lutheran 
students and as a baby-sitter for local children. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fritzges kids -- Mariah, 13, Rebecca, 11, Cliff, 8 -- were playing quietly 
at a corner table after school. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom checked this place out and likes it," Mariah says. "She sometimes 
comes here herself." 
</P>
<P>
 THE BENT CUE FAMILY BILLIARDS -- 1620 Newbury Road, Newbury Park. 11 a.m. to 2 
a.m. daily. Before 6 p.m., $4 an hour for one player, $6 for two or more; after 
6 p.m. Sundays through Thursdays, $5.50 for one and $8 for two or more; after 6 
p.m. Fridays through Saturdays, $10 an hour for two or more. Beer. All ages. 
499-4555. LOU BUTERA'S BILLIARDS 
</P>
<P>
 Long before Stiix, the no-nonsense Simi Valley club was known as a shooter's 
room, thanks to 14 professional Brunswick tables and the presence of Butera, a 
hall of famer who earned the nickname "Machine Gun Lou" by running 150 balls in 
21 minutes during a 1973 world championship match. 
</P>
<P>
 Butera, who opened the room in the late '70s, lives in Palmdale and doesn't 
show up as often as he once did, but his shoes have been amply filled by 
manager Billy Houck, one of the top players in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Remodeled last year, the club survived the Jan. 17 earthquake while the Sears 
outlet store next door was condemned. 
</P>
<P>
 "God likes pool players," says Debbie Brown, the club's tournament director. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its serious nature, the pool hall allows parents to drop their kids 
off on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they've got to be potty-trained," Houck says. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown chuckles dryly. "We don't change diapers." 
</P>
<P>
 LOU BUTERA'S BILLIARDS -- 2261 Tapo St., Simi Valley. 10 a.m. to 2 a.m. daily. 
$5 an hour for one player up to $7.75 for four. Beer by the pitcher. No one 
under 18 admitted before 3 p.m. weekdays. 584-9212. CHAMPION BILLIARDS AND 
AMUSEMENT CENTER 
</P>
<P>
 An unpretentious room in an old motorcycle shop, Champion caters strictly to 
youngsters and families in an environment free of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be clean and I want young people to be clean," says Ron Kaufman, 
who was recently given a key to the city for his work with Oxnard youth. 
</P>
<P>
 The club's nine tables are only 4 feet by 8 feet, slightly smaller than 
regulation. "This is not a shooter's place," Kaufman says. "If you open a 
family room, why put in big tables?" 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman also provides the latest video games in addition to air hockey and 
basketball, but he doesn't allow teen-agers to loiter. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I see them in here and they're just hanging out, I tell them to go do 
something constructive," Kaufman says. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman, who bought the club three years ago, expects to be around a long 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pool's like the trendy thing to do," he says. "But I'm in it for the long 
haul." 
</P>
<P>
 CHAMPION BILLIARDS AND AMUSEMENT CENTER -- 1475 S. Oxnard Blvd. 10 a.m. to 1 
a.m. daily. $6 an hour. No alcohol. All ages. 483-3855. FILLMORE BILLIARDS 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 Open four years, the Central Avenue club, which has three snooker tables 
sharing space with six pool tables, is a throwback to another era: A soda 
fountain serves vanilla shakes and 75-cent pickles, and the hours of business 
depend on the whim of the employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're busy, we could stay open until 11 p.m.," manager Colette Arnsdorf 
says. "We play it by ear." 
</P>
<P>
 The small-town attitude is also evidenced by the posted table fees: $1.50 for 
each half hour per person, with the second half hour free. Why not just charge 
$1.50 an hour? 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought the other way sounded better," Arnsdorf says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although gang members frequent the pool hall, they don't cause trouble for the 
agreeable 20-year-old Arnsdorf. "They come in to play and they leave," she 
says. "They're no problem whatsoever. It's not like they're mean to me or 
anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
 FILLMORE BILLIARDS -- 320 Central Ave., Fillmore. 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sundays 
through Thursdays, 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. Fridays through Saturdays. $1.50 for each 
half hour per person, second half hour free. No alcohol. All ages. 524-0539. 
GOLD COAST BILLIARDS 
</P>
<P>
 The small, down-home room in Oxnard has been around as long as Butera's place, 
with a new owner taking over five months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Dependent on regulars from the neighborhood, the club has an easy-going charm: 
Mothers with babies watch their husbands shoot pool while pets sit outside the 
front door, tied to a pole. Although backward caps are abundant, a sign warns 
customers to avoid "vulgar language." 
</P>
<P>
 The 11 tables include two billiard tables. Smoking is allowed, but alcohol 
isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 GOLD COAST BILLIARDS -- 4920 S. C St., Oxnard. Noon to midnight daily. $3 an 
hour per person. No alcohol. All ages. 486-1898.

POOL HALL RACKS UP DINGY REPUTATION 
</P>

<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You can't get a cappuccino, or even a diet soda, at Santa Paula Billiards, an 
authentic dark-and-dingy pool hall sandwiched between La Playita Seafood and 
Bertha's Hairstyling on Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a place that doesn't even pretend to be upscale or politically correct.A 
place where men feel obligated to smoke cigarettes and spit on the linoleum 
floor. And where women and children are noticeably absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from new ownership now and then and an occasional paint job, Santa Paula 
Billiards, with a bar in front and the pool room in back, hasn't changed since 
its Old West saloon doors first swung open in 1927. The tables -- five pool, 
three snooker, two billiards -- are original. So is the long, hand-carved wood 
bar. Fallout from chalk dust -- settling over the room like volcanic ash -- is 
probably original too. 
</P>
<P>
 When Anheuser-Busch was looking for a musty pool hall with flickering 
fluorescents, cracked vinyl chairs, cigarette smog and lots of character, it 
chose Santa Paula Billiards as the setting for a recent Bud Light commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Morales, whose father Oscar bought the place 12 years ago, wouldn't trade 
his no-frills establishment for any modern pool hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new places have no character," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrities have been attracted to Santa Paula Billiards for its gritty, 
nostalgic look. "Nick Nolte came in for a beer and to watch pool," Mark says. 
"Debra Winger was here. Willie Mosconi (the late world billiards champion) 
played here." 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest continuous pool hall in the county, Santa Paula Billiards is not 
about to change. 
</P>
<P>
 "The atmosphere of this place," Mark says, "will always stay the same." JEFF

LOCAL FIRM PRODUCES WORLD CLASS TABLES

 Look out Brunswick. Here comes Forgie. 
</P>
<P>
 A small manufacturer in Ventura, Bill Forgie has been making world-class pool 
tables in the two years he's been in business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of all the tables I've seen in the last 15 or 20 years, his are probably more 
precise and better made than any other today," says Terry Moldenhauer, a 
distributor. "Pound for pound, they're the best on the market." 
</P>
<P>
 Forgie learned his craft as an apprentice to Cap Porter, whose Renaissance 
tables are the most expensive in the world, selling for as much as $50,000. 
Forgie, wife Anna and two employees produce about 500 antique- and modern-style 
tables a year, with prices ranging from $2,500 to $3,500, a few hundred dollars 
less than Brunswick's Gold Crown. 
</P>
<P>
 Forgie supplied the tables for 10 pool halls in the Los Angeles area last year 
and all 10 tables at Nicholby's in Ventura, but he's not out to become a mass 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to get too big," he says. "I don't mind growing, but big is a 
hassle." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Matchin, owner of Stiix Billiards, is in no hurry to buy a Forgie. "I 
want to see a Forgie in five years," Matchin says. "I'm reserving judgment 
until then." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bill Forgie isn't worried about his tables' durability. "We're trying to 
make a quality product and use good materials," he says. "If we do, our tables 
should last a lifetime." JEFF MEYERS

SIGHTS; EXHIBIT RANGES FROM SURREAL TO THE FLORAL; 'THREE WOMEN' FEATURES 
WATERCOLORS BY PHYLLIS DOYON, PHOTOGRAPHS BY CARLA LARSON AND MONOTYPES BY

 Gender and self-reliance are the determining factors behind "Three Women," the 
current show at the Thousand Oaks Community Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is an inspiring subplot, it has to do with the artists' effort to 
make their own opportunities. These artists put on their own show from the 
ground up, right down to sweeping up and keeping watch over the gallery during 
operating hours. Art will find its way. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is art worth looking at. Watercolorist Phyllis Doyon traffics in 
fanciful floral subjects. Larger pieces tend to be frenetic, while the smaller 
images, with tighter focus, have an aura of floral portraiture. Deft in her 
medium, and relishing such details as dew drops, she gives florid a good name. 
</P>
<P>
 In another corner, photographer Carla Larson shows a wild cross-section of 
images. Some are suitable for an art gallery: the cryptic still life 
"Cymbidium," the almost surreal nocturnal shot, "Ninth Hole." Other pieces seem 
out of place here, such as cast photos from a production of "Song of Norway." 
</P>
<P>
 Plainly, the most striking work comes from Silvia J.K. Simmons, a transplanted 
Korean and now a Moorpark resident. Her art represents a happy marriage of 
eastern and western art ideals. A restless, searching quality combines with an 
assured technical ability. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the work here consists of monotypes, tending toward dark patinas and 
abstract schemes, with subtle gradations not visible to the casually observing 
eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, there seems to be a correlation to the rhythms and textures of music, 
made explicit in Simmons' "Song for Britten," built on the horizontal grid of a 
musical staff. A wisp of fabric flailing in the wind flaps from above into the 
picture frame of "Purple Wind," a depiction of a natural element. 
</P>
<P>
 "Milagro" is a rustic relief piece based around a central crucifix, with 
materials including wood, metal and pennies. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons' work can be whimsical too. The sculpture "Wedding" stands lonely in 
the middle of the large gallery, with the happy couple in the form of a curving 
stick and another pole donning a wire wedding dress. 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece of Simmons' section of the exhibit, and the show in general, 
is a multimedia work called "Credo." Linen is sewn onto canvas with the crude 
seams offering a tactile element. 
</P>
<P>
 Various Asian characters -- quoting Buddhist and Catholic prayers -- serve 
linguistic and, to the non-comprehending viewer, graphic functions, supplying 
structural overlay to the impressionistic surface of the piece, which includes 
found natural objects. 
</P>
<P>
 A veneer of pre-industrial antiquity and personal reference gives the work a 
magnetic presence. The balance of intuition and a sense of order is what keeps 
it in check, communicating across cultures without ever announcing its 
intentions plainly. It speaks softly but firmly. Ojai Eye Festival 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai was abuzz with the annual parade of Ojai Festival-goers last weekend. 
Some of that transient traffic actually ventured beyond the lure of merchandise 
and consumables to where the art was -- not in the park, but in the Ojai Center 
for the Arts, which is showing some impressive work. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai artist Alberta Fins, anything but a Sunday painter, makes a brand of 
multimedia art that seems to materialize only after being burned, scraped and 
smashed into shape. Her blurry references to religion and her patently 
unsentimental collage technique result in a compelling art clotted with pain, 
but also offer the signs of working through said pain and finding flashes of 
insight. 
</P>
<P>
 In stark contrast, Betty McDonald's Joseph Cornell-like box assemblages come 
from a place of reworked nostalgia and homespun charm. If the work at times 
veers toward the too-cute ("Sweet Lips"), much of her work manages to be 
ambiguous without being pell mell, and anecdotal without relying on easy punch 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Venae Price's show, "Mandorlas and Stuff," has a certain surging energy on its 
side. Rough-hewn abstract works involve murky pools of color and biomorphic 
forms. These forms either vaporously overlap -- a nod to Robert Delaunay and 
his Orphism -- or they nudge each other nervously, like amorphous blobs in 
mating season. 
</P>
<P>
 The entertaining "God, the Moon and the Bottlecap" evokes a sense of dizzy 
motion, featuring a bottlecap-as-allegorical orb, and a surreal landscape 
suggested by a horizon line. A vertical band with film sprocket holes aligns 
"Encumbered Leap of Faith," mediating the less linear elements -- the bulbous 
organic forms, glinted with silver and copper shades. 
</P>
<P>
 In the best work here, Price maintains a delicate balance -- or bemoans the 
repressive instinct to instill order -- between form and formlessness. In Your 
Face 
</P>
<P>
 Paulette Beakley's photography show, "The View Up Close," at the Buenaventura 
Gallery, gets right in your face, if only literally. Her images of nature, 
exotic birds and bottles, are seen at spitting distance, to the point where 
sometimes the recognizable almost bleeds into the abstract. Almost. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Pond," stalks, leaves and blossoms are seen in scrambled orders of 
importance. Images of thorny succulents have an increased sense of foreboding, 
with a jagged-edge sense of danger, and, in "Such a Bird" -- despite the 
cornball title -- a bird's rainbow plumage turns into an engaging explosion of 
color. Details

THEATER REVIEW; IGNORANCE IS BLISS (FAMILY) IN THIS CROWDED BRITISH HOUSE; 
LIGHT AND FROTHY, NOEL COWARD'S 'HAY FEVER' IN OXNARD IS AN ENTIRELY PLEASANT 
EVENING'S FARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 While not a premiere example of British drawing-room comedy, Noel Coward's 
"Hay Fever" has the advantage to modern audiences of its timeless subject 
matter -- the folly of love -- and a lack of familiarity. The plucky Etc., 
Etc., Etc. theater company is currently presenting the play at its headquarters 
in Oxnard's Heritage Square. 
</P>
<P>
 Light and frothy, "Hay Fever" is an entirely pleasant evening's entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignorance is bliss, goes the old saying, and the Bliss family in Coward's play 
is nothing but ignorant when it comes to matters of the heart. Judith Bliss, a 
(for the moment) retired actress, and her husband, author David Bliss, are 
visiting their country home, along with daughter, Sorel, and son, Simon. 
</P>
<P>
 They are, in the words of a visitor, "a very bohemian family." The elder 
Blisses, though still married, are so in name only, and David has invited to 
the house Jackie, a young woman he has only recently met. 
</P>
<P>
 Judith has invited a boxer who is much younger than she, and the children also 
have each invited acquaintances of the opposite sex to the country home. 
Unfortunately, the home hasn't enough rooms for all the guests, and none of the 
Blisses has bothered to inform the others until it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Before long, everybody's paired up, if not with the expected person. By the 
end of the play's quick two hours, everybody is where he or she belongs. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no subplots, political overtones, or anything else to tax the 
imagination; simply a number of examples of that peculiarly British stereotype, 
the upper-class twit, and four strangers who form their own alliances in 
response to the Blisses. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast is a mix of veterans, relative veterans and callow newcomers, none of 
whom turns in a really embarrassing performance under Linda Hyde's direction 
(if this sounds like a backhanded compliment, so be it). Some, in fact, sparkle 
in their characterizations, particularly Martin Horsey, Helena Digby, Madee 
Stone and Hugh Bogan. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, it's three of the four genuinely British actors -- Digby 
(Sorel), John Fincham (Sandy, the boxer) and Horsey (Sorel's date) -- who speak 
with the lightest English accents. Kay Digby, also English and playing Clara 
the maid, indulges herself with a very broad Cockney accent. 
</P>
<P>
 The non-Brits include Judy Heiliger as Judith Bliss; Bogan as husband David; 
Brenda Miller as Simon's date, Myra; newcomer Randy Ellis as Simon, and Madee 
Stone as David Bliss's would-be inamorata. Stone may have the most intriguing 
biography in the play's program: in addition to a couple of film credits, it 
notes that "she has appeared in commercials, an NBC gameshow pilot, and was a 
contestant on 'The $25,000 Pyramid.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A word about Etc. Etc. Etc.'s theater. Situated in the basement of one of 
Heritage Square's lovely vintage homes, the performance space has been 
considerably improved since the "Drop Dead!" production, their last show in the 
same space. Also, patrons of the earlier show will notice, the new chairs are 
far more comfortable than their predecessors. Details

REWIND; 'ROBOT MONSTER,' SPACY '50S SCI-FI SPIN DELIGHTFULLY CHEESY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.M.

<TEXT>
<P>
 There have been a number of science-fiction movies made about the impending 
destruction of the human race by alien invaders. But it's doubtful there has 
ever been one created quite like the uproariously funny and campy "Robot 
Monster." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the preposterous-looking space villain at the heart of this 1953 
low-budget film has to rank as one of the cheesiest aliens ever to stumble onto 
the silver screen. It's simply hard to take seriously a paunchy bad guy attired 
in a gorilla suit and a diving helmet with antennae. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the makers of "Robot Monster" seem to have had their tongues 
planted firmly in cheek when they were concocting this delightfully absurd work 
(though some critics believe otherwise). The often loony actions of the 
characters and the stiffly delivered dialogue seem to have been designed to 
elicit laughs rather than fear that earthly civilization is about to come to an 
end. 
</P>
<P>
 "Robot Monster" kicks into gear when an alien, Ro-Man (George Barrows), 
unleashes a cosmic ray that wipes out all but eight humans. These earthlings 
manage to survive because they happened to have ingested a newly created 
antibiotic that makes them immune to the lethal powers of the evil alien. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Ro-Man (which is also the name given his galactic species) is 
hell-bent on destroying the last remaining humans. 
</P>
<P>
 But his mission is partly undermined by his own feelings of doubt and even 
love. Through a video transmitter, he admits to his leader that for the first 
time in his life he feels unsure of himself. To this shocking revelation his 
stern superior responds, "You sound like a human, not a Ro-Man!" 
</P>
<P>
 Ro-Man really loses sight of his duties when he falls for Alice (Claudia 
Barrett), a fetching and brainy earthling. Knowing his weakness, Alice sees an 
opportunity to save the last humans on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Robot Monster" is great fun, and the enjoyment is further heightened by the 
fact that it was shot in "Three Dimension Process." So put on those 3-D glasses 
(supplied by Unearthly Videos and Books) and have a blast following the 
adventures of Ro-Man. 
</P>
<P>
 "Robot Monster" (1953), directed by Phil Tucker. 63 minutes. Not rated. J.M.

REEL LIFE / FILM AND VIDEO FILE; UCSB TO LAUNCH STUDY OF TELEVISION VIOLENCE; 
THE THREE-YEAR, $3-MILLION PROJECT WILL LOOK BEYOND NUMBERS TO THE CONTEXT IN 
WHICH ACTS TAKE PLACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PANCHO DOLL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tempest over television violence blew into Santa Barbara with the 
announcement that the UCSB communications department will direct a three-year, 
$3 million study about tempers on the tube. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, funded by the National Cable Television Assn., will go beyond 
simply cataloguing acts of violence and instead try to place violence in 
context of plot, said Edward Donnerstein, head of the UCSB communication 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that often all you get is counts. That's what you hear at 
congressional hearings -- X number of violent acts portrayed on television 
during a time period," Donnerstein said. "We want to get away from that and 
define what constitutes violence that's harmful to children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditionally if someone shot a gun, that was considered violence. But under 
that system, if 'Schindler's List' was shown on television, it would be the 
most violent program of the week. Well, our intent is to consider that it would 
be the most educational program of the week. We want to work with the industry 
to come up with a coding system that really takes context into consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 The study starts in September and will monitor 25 channels. The shows will be 
taped and the tapes reviewed by Donnerstein and his staff. The results will be 
published annually during each of the three years of the study. 
</P>
<P>
 Donnerstein said the study is by far the largest ever -- 2,700 hours. 
Previously, the largest study was just 180 hours, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To counter criticism that the cable industry is influencing the study by its 
sponsorship, MediaScope, a Los Angeles nonprofit organization funded by the 
Carnegie Corp. and the California Wellness Program, will appoint an advisory 
board to act as a buffer between researchers and the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadcast networks have opted to fund studies of their own. All of this is to 
counter government complaints about violence in the media. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten or more pieces of anti-violence legislation are being drafted in Congress, 
including a bill calling for the Federal Communications Commission to set 
formal violence standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), a long-time critic of violence in television, 
praised the cable study, saying that it goes beyond even what he's called for. 
</P>
<P>
 Donnerstein said the issue is important because studies show that media 
violence can affect behavior in those already predisposed toward violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly four out of five Americans believe violence in television entertainment 
programs directly contributes to violence in society, and 54% say they would 
support government guidelines to limit the amount of mayhem on TV, according to 
a Los Angeles Times poll taken in December.

ON THE ROAD: A LESSON IN THE SURREAL INSPIRES MAGICAL WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD REED 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first thing the kids didn't believe was that blood dripped from sliced 
watermelon. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly, the simple wood chairs flying straight up into the air posed no 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Art is like that. Kids are like that. 
</P>
<P>
 The painting with the watermelon and chairs is "La Noche de la Sandia," by the 
Los Angeles artist Patssi Valdez and on display at the Carnegie Museum here. 
</P>
<P>
 The students are Melyssa Alcantar and Rick Reyes and Crystal Gutierrez and a 
host of other Rio Real School third-graders on a field trip, an outing that 
will challenge the way they see the world. 
</P>
<P>
 It will, of course, be much more than that. 
</P>
<P>
 So many of the academic rules they've learned by -- control, neatness, the 
natural order of reality -- will be dropped, suspended, useless. The world of 
the surreal, in this case a mystical vision in which fruit bleeds, will 
prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 And then what? 
</P>
<P>
 A sly Suzanne Bellah, the Carnegie's director, won't tell. 
</P>
<P>
 All the kids know is that they are, for the first time in their lives, in a 
museum. And that when Ms. Bellah is through engaging them on the subject of 
flying chickens, cactus that grows through walls, and what she calls other 
"strange things," they will be asked to commit their own visions to paper. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's when things get rough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go ahead," says Ms. Bellah, handing out paper and pencils. "Go all around the 
museum, and look at these magic paintings for an angel. Then draw an angel -- 
any way you want. Copy an angel if you like." 
</P>
<P>
 They do. Slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 And treacherously, for the pencils have no erasers. Neatness is impossible. 
The errant line must be accepted or slashed over with a darker line, a bolder 
stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 And all caution -- no matter how much sweat is summoned over controlling the 
embryonic image -- goes unredeemed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I messed up" is the refrain of numerous students. 
</P>
<P>
 Their call is answered by Ms. Bellah: "You can't mess up. There are no 
mistakes. This is not a test. You are simply warming up your hands and your 
eyes for the real fun, downstairs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More than 5,000 students from kindergarten through junior high school take 
this journey through the Carnegie each year. Most of them have never been to a 
museum. And most come from schools in which art education -- particularly 
studio, hands-on art instruction -- has been cut back for lack of money or is 
wanting for more teacher expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Mervyn's department store chain issues a grant to pay for much of the 
cost of the tours. Schools also donate $1 per student to the museum. And the 
investment is tightly focused to not only introduce art to the kids but to 
involve them in its creation. 
</P>
<P>
 It's difficult to tell how such a program affects a child's life. America 
today redeems practical skills in the marketplace, and leaner curriculums 
reflect that: It's a get-a-job world that is, with increasing technological 
efficiencies, trickier and trickier to compete in. 
</P>
<P>
 More than anything, it's a world of real bleeding hearts and real bleeding 
hands, not bleeding watermelons. 
</P>
<P>
 But you wouldn't know that downstairs when Arla Crane's third-grade class 
comes face-to-face with the woman they've been warming up for: Oxnard painter 
Suzanne Schecter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Schechter is swift, blunt, without condescension. She treats these students as 
adults. This is not surprising, however, as Schechter knows how intimidating 
art can be to the rest of us: She's the provocative teacher of an adult class 
here called "Drawing for the Artistically Discouraged." 
</P>
<P>
 But adults have that much more control to let go of, that much more baggage to 
shed. These 8-year-olds, primed into accepting bleeding fruit and faulty angels 
as legitimate forms of expression, are now showing signs of eagerness. 
</P>
<P>
 Schechter outlines the same wide-angled room as the Valdez painting upstairs 
and explains, without using the word perspective, how the artist is "a giant 
who removed the ceiling and looks down into the room." 
</P>
<P>
 She goes on to explain that "real things in a picture is like real life, but 
when you connect magic to life -- birds flying through crooked rooms, or 
anything you can think of -- then you have a magic room." 
</P>
<P>
 They are told to play giant and make a magic room. With pastel chalks and 
Scented Baby Fresh wipes to smear them into paint, they go at it. 
</P>
<P>
 Liliana Galvan is shy, hiding her drawing from anyone who chances a glimpse. 
Ted Taylor draws the room in amazingly accurate 3-D proportion, then drops a 
bicycle into it -- to oohs and ahs. Crystal Gutierrez renders a dark vision, 
slashing and smearing the walls in haunting Franz Kline black seared by a lurid 
red window. Gerardo Alejandre's symmetry is fearful: two hearts in a window, 
two balloons in another window, a star and a moon in yet another. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, Liliana's no longer shy. She pries her hands away to reveal a 
peaceful, sanctuary-like room with lime walls and a red cross outside her 
window, a red cross that fills the sky, commands the room, rules her world.

 These kids clearly took Schechter to heart when she said: "Maybe if you draw 
it, it will happen." 
</P>
<P>
 That, certainly, is magic. And that, certainly, is something powerful to carry 
through a modern life requiring so much more than reading, writing and 
arithmetic.

FASHION; SUITS FOR MATURE SWIMMERS FLESHED OUT; THOSE OLD FAVORITES, SKIRTS AND 
THE '40S-STYLE 'LITTLE BOY' LEG, ARE BACK IN STYLE AGAIN.

 About this time of year, a decision has to be made regarding beachwear. Should 
a self-determined, '90s woman with a lifestyle not primarily devoted to running 
track, appear at the beach in a suit small enough to conceal in a closed fist? 
</P>
<P>
 Would she be justified in waving this fist in the face of swimsuit designers? 
These are the folks, after all, who have conceived the string bikini, the thong 
and the cleverly disguised tank suit, which appears to offer bottom coverage 
until it is actually worn. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to popular belief, there are what we will call alternative swimsuits. 
Sports Illustrated editors may blanch at the thought (if they have the grace to 
blanch at anything), but out in swim land, there are suits with coverage that 
rivals the media reporting on Whitewater -- with directly opposite results, 
that is: cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
 These garments may not be hanging in display windows, nor will they show up in 
every store. But with determination, the average swimmer can find a suit that 
allows her to cross the sand with ample spandex between her and the public eye. 
</P>
<P>
 What has happened, said Lynn Hulette of Lynn's Swims in Thousand Oaks, is that 
some designers have at last realized that the boomers -- who drive the 
marketplace -- have aged. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the manufacturers are accommodating people like they never have 
before," she said. "This year, they really have brought down the sides a little 
bit and they've put more structure into the suits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I make it a point of getting those types of suits in, because ladies 25 and 
older really can't wear those little skimpy nothing suits, and they don't want 
to." 
</P>
<P>
 Skirted suits are back in style, according to Hulette, as well as those with 
the "little boy" leg, a la the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 At Jantzen, there was more good news: A spokeswoman told us that their suits 
will come with a picture tag to indicate the fit of the suit without trying it 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can judge how high the leg is cut, and from that you can get an idea of 
the coverage for the derriere," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 So, they know there's a problem. But, she said, Jantzen has carried a 
fuller-cut line all through the lean-swimsuit times. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as she put it, "we have never forsaken our steadfast following of missy 
customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Those of us who think that we are buying women's sizes as opposed to juniors 
may be disappointed to know that we are thought of as "missys," but maybe we're 
over-sensitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, retailers' reports are encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
 Rains in Ojai has the little-boy style as well as skirted suits, buyer Beverly 
Waid said. She says Elisabeth Stewart suits are reliable for a little extra 
fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always bring in a few of them for the lady who is very conscious of her 
upper leg," Waid said. "They do quite well." 
</P>
<P>
 And at the Broadway in Ventura, a salesclerk recommended -- among roomier 
brands -- Jantzen, one style by Baja Blue and one by Mainstream, entitled -- 
fittingly -- the Hip Hider. 
</P>
<P>
 So, women who have advanced from juniors to, uh, missys might celebrate the 
expanding consciousness of an industry. Fuller suits could put confidence back 
in the beach stroll and return purpose to the age-old gesture of tugging a suit 
down upon emerging from a swim. This, we ask you to consider, is no small 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
 We did a field test at San Buenaventura State Beach to check on the season's 
cover-up trend and found that area women may, in fact, be ahead of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about half of women beach-goers were in revealing suits such as minimal 
tanks and bikinis, none of which was the still-startling thong. 
</P>
<P>
 Many turned out in shorts, cutoffs and workout clothes; a few wore swim 
dresses or skirted suits. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those who appeared in a skirted style was Darla Hoback of Valencia, who 
said she had bought the suit several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of the women I know in my age group, 38 to 42, most of them have bathing 
suits like I am wearing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not yet aware of swimwear's conservative swing, Hoback admitted that she had 
some misgivings about her outfit's fashion appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loaned this suit to my mother when she visited, and she loved it," she 
said. "That made me think maybe I shouldn't have bought this suit."

SHOP TALK; A LITTLE COMPARISON SHOPPING TO FIT YOUNGSTERS TO A TEE; T-SHIRTS 
ARE SIMPLE ATTIRE, SURE, BUT THIS YOUTH STAPLE DESERVES SERIOUS CONSIDERATION. 
AND BY ALL MEANS, TAKE THE KIDS ALONG. 
</P>

<P>
 Here in Southern California, there are basically two kinds of weather: T-shirt 
weather and sweater weather. And it's definitely T-shirt time now. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're getting your kids ready for camp, you'll be stocking up on the 
ubiquitous tee, and there are a lot of them to choose from. 
</P>
<P>
 What is the difference between the generic tees? While one mom swears by 
Target's T-shirts, another mom loves the Gap Kids' pocket tee. Even Bullock's 
produces a line of low-priced generic tees. We decided to take a closer look to 
see what really makes these tees tick. 
</P>
<P>
 We bought 100% cotton tees at all three stores in a girl's size 6 and a boy's 
size 8. The first and easiest difference to discern is price. Target's Trend 
Basics line is the lowest at $3.99. Bullock's doubles the price of a T-shirt at 
$8. The Gap Kids Basic T is $7.50. 
</P>
<P>
 The shirts all looked very crisp and cute when we tried them on the kids. 
Target's T-shirts don't have the pocket, but the kids didn't seem to mind. We 
don't think that pockets are worth $3.50 to $4 either. 
</P>
<P>
 We also noticed, as the kids were modeling, that the neckline on the Gap's tee 
looked best. Not a big deal, but Joan Crawford would notice. The Gap's tee also 
has the boxiest fit -- cut widest through the shoulders and across the middle. 
When we measured, we found the Gap's tees to be around two inches wider than 
the Bullock's T-shirt and around four inches wider than the Target model. 
Buying a size larger will take care of this up to a point, but the tee will be 
a bit long and the sleeves rather wide. 
</P>
<P>
 After a couple of washes and hot dryer cycles, we were not surprised that all 
the shirts shrank. The biggest shrinkage came from the Gap's shirt. But we were 
warned at the store to expect this. The least shrinkage was from the Bullock's 
tee. Target's tee shrinkage was somewhere between the two. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the softness and the thickness of the cottons, we drove ourselves batty 
trying to decide. Blindfolding members of the family didn't help. Everybody had 
a different opinion. Not having a micrometer, we concluded that the shirts are 
incredibly close in these categories, the Bullock's and Gap tees being ever so 
slightly smoother. 
</P>
<P>
 Something we can judge about the T-shirts is their color. The color selection 
at Bullock's was uninspiring. Target had some really nice shades of purple and 
green. Our favorite color spectrum was at the Gap. The Gap and Gap Kids change 
their "color group" every six to eight weeks. This means that there are usually 
plenty of T-shirts marked down somewhere in the back of the store. 
</P>
<P>
 If you haven't been to a Gap Kids, you are in for a treat. One just opened in 
The Oaks mall in Thousand Oaks. Wherever you decide to buy your kids' tees, be 
sure to take them along to help pick them out. They're never a good deal if not 
worn.

EARTHWATCH: TURNING A NEW PAGE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT; INCREASING NUMBERS OF 
PALM-SIZE 'ELECTRONIC BOOKS' ARE BECOMING AVAILABLE ON CD-ROM DISKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD KAHLENBERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 Dr. Ed Vodak of Ventura practices good environmental medicine -- good for his 
patients and good for the forests. He provides well researched medical advice 
but doesn't require lots of thick reference books -- which take trees to make 
-- to keep current. He has "electronic books," part of a new trend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do consulting work in Latin America and take along my Merck Manual and my 
PDR," he explained. The first book he mentioned is the most widely used medical 
reference in the world and the second, the Physician's Desk Reference, provides 
the latest annual details on all the drugs being prescribed. He reads them on a 
little screen like a pocket calculator. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10% of U.S. doctors carry palm-size electronic versions of these leading 
reference works, normally totaling 4,000 pages, in the pockets of their white 
coats. The rest of the profession bought more than a million recent copies of 
the printed versions -- for their offices -- inadvertently consuming acres of 
forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Vodak uses a $200 device made by Franklin Electronic Publishers. Any doctor, 
or a health-conscious consumer, can insert into it a domino-sized cartridge 
containing a Merck Manual, a Mayo Clinic Family Health Book, etc. There are 9 
million of these hand-held reading gizmos in use. 
</P>
<P>
 I learned about this, and other examples of treeless book manufacturing at the 
recent American Booksellers Assn. convention in Los Angeles. The hot topic was 
"electronic publishing." Several technologies are available besides the 
portable Franklin products, most involving home computers -- the CD-ROM type 
where you get stills and movies with your sound and text. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight million Americans have CD-ROM equipment, according to Bernie Roth, 
Executive Director of the association, who expects this figure will double in 
three years because most home computers sold from now on will have the new 
technology built in. 
</P>
<P>
 At the convention I saw a plain old book being brandished about, its 
300,000-copy print order said to require three metric tons of paper -- hundreds 
of trees. It was being brandished by someone promoting compact discs of 
reference works. Customers can get 600 times more info in a digitized version 
than in a book. Plus bells and whistles. Franklin has something that displays 
and speaks Spanish and English in translation from your open palm. 
</P>
<P>
 This week the bestseller-type book went electronic. Ed Elrod at the Ventura 
Bookshop now offers "The John Haldeman Diaries: Inside the Nixon White House" 
both the 700-page book edition and the Sony Electronic Publishing Co.'s CD-ROM 
electronic edition. The latter contains the original book plus 2,000 more diary 
pages along with 700 photos and 45 minutes of candid homemade movie footage 
shot by the former White House chief of staff who died last fall. A 
lap-crushing data heap if you were to get it in the traditional form -- but 
just a plastic wafer in its electronic incarnation -- for about $70. 
</P>
<P>
 Elrod jumped at the chance to stock the electronic version because he just 
returned from Europe, having traveled there on an ABA grant. There, he saw that 
the Europeans were generally ahead of American booksellers in this publishing 
trend. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems one of Ed Elrod's customers may, by coincidence, have provided 
something of a final word on this connection between electronic publishing and 
environmentalism. As our intrepid local bookseller recalls the incident: "When 
I asked this person if he wanted a paper bag for the book he'd bought, he said 
to me: "Here we're standing in the largest tree cemetery in town and you're 
asking me if I want a bag ?" Details 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: For electronic (no paper) reference works such as The Merck Manual, 
Physician's Desk Register, and talking foreign language dictionaries, from $29 
to $599, call Franklin Electronic Publishers (800) 762-5382. CD-ROM players, 
starting at $200 are available at local Teltron and Sears, Roebuck & Co. stores 
along with a selection of encyclopedia in CD-ROM format. Also check with your 
local software store. Some may carry "CD-ROMS in Print" the most comprehensive 
annual listing (900 pages on paper) at $99. Published on a single CD-ROM it's 
$49. Otherwise, call the publisher, Mecklermedia, (203) 226-6976.

JAUNTS; 40 CALIFORNIA WINERIES TO SERVE THEIR BEST AT OJAI WINE FESTIVAL; UP TO 
5,000 ARE EXPECTED TO SAMPLE FINE VINTAGES AND FOOD IN PICNIC ATMOSPHERE.

 Columnist Art Buchwald said one of the best things about living in France was 
learning how to tell the difference between red wine and white wine. 
</P>
<P>
 You might be a little more savvy. Regardless of your wine expertise, there 
will be plenty of the red and white stuff at the Ojai Wine Festival this Sunday 
on the shores of Lake Casitas. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the eighth year the Rotary Club of Ojai-West has sponsored the 
festival, which in past years has drawn anywhere from 3,000 to 5,000 wine 
lovers. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, about 40 California wineries will have their wines available for 
tasting, along with a group of Australian wines, according to Les Martin, a 
Rotary Club member. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who want to talk about wine have an opportunity to meet the winemaker 
and find out how it's made and the character of different wines," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival runs from noon to 5 p.m. Advance tickets (through Friday) are 
$13.50; or $15 at the gate Saturday. For non-drinkers and those 13 through 20, 
tickets are $5. Children under 12 are free. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how it works for those imbibing. Admission gets you a commemorative 
wineglass and nine tasting tickets. Each ticket entitles you to 1.5 ounces of 
wine. Additional tickets are $1 each. So you stroll the grounds and sample the 
Chardonnays, Cabernet Sauvignons and the Burgundies. 
</P>
<P>
 If you find a wine you love, you won't be able to buy any bottles at the 
festival. The club is very cautious about how much people drink there, Martin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very aware throughout the event of people who might be getting ahead of 
themselves," he said. The club will have drivers on hand if someone needs a 
ride home or a lift to a motel. "We've never had a problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the festival is more than just drinking wine. Whole families come with 
picnics or they dine on the food provided by several local restaurants. There 
is music, activities for children like face painting, and arts and crafts. 
</P>
<P>
 For adults who really want to get into the spirit of the festival, they can 
toss off their shoes for the grape stomping contest. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival is a fund-raiser for the charitable projects the Rotary club 
sponsors locally, like the bicycles and uniforms they supplied for the Police 
Department's bike patrol, or the rest stops they built along the Ojai Valley 
Trail. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the wineries at the event will have four different kinds of wine for 
people to sample. Local wineries will be there, including Old Creek Ranch & 
Winery, Ojai Vineyard, and Leeward Winery, as well as many from Santa Barbara 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 For people who want to know more about wine, it's a chance to schmooze with 
the winemakers. "Many of them don't understand the differences," Martin said. 
Sampling lets them find out what they like and don't like. 
</P>
<P>
 What's hot in wine circles now? According to Martin, who also owns the liquor 
store known as the Attitude Adjustment Shop in Ojai, "red wines are coming into 
demand." Details

EXHIBIT; EH, WHAT'S UP, CULTURE FANS? IT'S YOUR CUDDLY OLD PAL PETER; SANTA

 Before Bugs Bunny, Roger Rabbit, Harvey, the Playboy Bunny and maybe even the 
Easter Bunny (nobody knows when the Easter Bunny showed up -- I called the 
library), there was Peter Rabbit. The work of Beatrix Potter, this wascally 
wabbit's literary mom, is featured in an exhibition at the Santa Barbara Museum 
of Natural History called "The World of Peter Rabbit." The exhibition, which 
includes a re-creation of Mr. McGregor's garden, a Victorian Gallery with 
Potter memorabilia and drawings, and a Discovery Room for the little ones, will 
run through the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The rabbit-friendly aura of the place becomes quickly apparent as a kid in a 
life-sized bunny suit greets visitors outside the 3,600-square-foot Fleischmann 
Auditorium, which has been transformed into an English country garden from the 
turn of the century. Lining the entrance are varmint visions of filling 
fast-food -- potted specimens of pelargonium, verbena, alyssum, calendula, 
snapdragons and that old garden favorite, hydrangea. 
</P>
<P>
 First thing inside is Mr. McGregor's garden, apparently with a direct line to 
the Miracle-Gro factory. When's the last time you saw a five-foot cabbage, a 
beach ball-size turnip or a nine-foot carrot top?

<P>
 This garden is, of course, where Peter narrowly avoided being the guest of 
honor at a hoedown. Most rabbits have a peanut-size brain and a one-track mind 
geared to making more rabbits. That's life at the bottom of the food chain. 
Thus, Peter was smart or lucky -- and, in any case, quick. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. McGregor's plot is right near a large hollowed-out tree stump, a perfect 
rabbit hide-out, now transformed into a play area for the smallest visitors, 
who generally have trouble keeping it to a mild uproar. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposite the garden is a lengthy chronology of Potter's long life. She died in 
1943 at the age of 77, but not before writing and illustrating 23 books, all of 
which have been reprinted more than 100 times and in a variety of languages, 
including Icelandic and Japanese. This success enabled Potter to buy a working 
farm in 1905, then in 1924 a 19,000-acre sheep farm to which she retired 
happily ever after. There's a great photo of Potter, the primly dressed 
Victorian with her pet rabbit, Benjamin Bouncer, on a leash. 
</P>
<P>
 Potter wrote the first Peter Rabbit story at age 26 while vacationing in 
Scotland with her family. She found nothing interesting about Scotland, so she 
made up a story about a rabbit as part of a letter written to a young boy named 
Noel Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 The first edition of Peter Rabbit came out at the end of 1901 with 
black-and-white drawings and a print run of 250 copies. Less than a year later, 
Frederick Warne & Co. printed 8,000 copies of the book featuring Potter's 
original watercolors. Why are the books so small? To fit the little hands of 
her readers, naturally. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides painting cute, little, sartorially splendid bunnies, squirrels, 
hedgehogs, mice and ducks, Potter was an accomplished naturalist who painted 
the local flora and fauna, including hundreds of varieties of mushrooms, in her 
English Lake District. A Victorian Gallery contains samples of many of her 
scientific endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Discovery Room features a number of hands-on activities for children, such 
as a pond where they can fish for soft cuddly animals, using specially designed 
poles. Halloween comes early for those who wish to try on several critter 
costumes. A computerized game challenges puzzle lovers to decipher Potter' 
secret diary, a feat not accomplished until 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 Commemorating "The Tale of Two Bad Mice," there's a mouse dollhouse full of 
sleepy live mice. There are also live bunny rabbits and handout literature 
available on their proper care. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the Discovery Room, a Victorian playhouse is popular. On the way out, 
Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, a four-foot hedgehog, is doing her laundry. 
</P>

RESTAURANT REVIEW; BARBECUE PAYS OFF FOR PATRONS AND OWNERS; THE WOOD RANCH BBQ 
& GRILL OFFERS AFFORDABLE MEALS THAT FEATURE HIGH QUALITY AND HUGE PORTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Wood Ranch BBQ & Grill opened near the junction of the Simi Valley and the 
Moorpark freeways roughly two years ago. There was little need for yet another 
barbecue emporium in rib-heavy Ventura County. Worse, the restaurant climate 
for newcomers back then was even bleaker than it is now: savagely competitive, 
ruthlessly Darwinian in allowing only the fittest -- and fattest -- to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wood Ranch BBQ has more than survived. It has flourished. 
</P>
<P>
 It is full most every night and so jammed on weekends as to dispense vibrating 
beeper devices to which patrons can respond, perhaps after a half-hour wait, 
for their tables. Wood Ranch plans to multiply, with a second Ventura County 
restaurant now in lease-negotiation stages. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the owners of Wood Ranch BBQ is Eric Anders. He brings to 
restaurateuring a keen sense of the marketplace, perhaps honed during his MBA 
days at UCLA. As a result, he espouses -- and delivers on -- a simple premise 
so "revolutionary" as to be lost on many a beleaguered restaurateur: The 
customer must not only be happy but feel he or she gains more from the dinner 
investment than he or she pays out. 
</P>
<P>
 Translation: high quality and huge portions in a changing, upbeat environment 
you can afford to take the family to. 
</P>
<P>
 It's worked. The food is at worst only good and often excellent -- though 
reference-quality barbecue is found elsewhere. The prices are extremely 
competitive and, in some conspicuous instances at the menu's higher end, 
loss-leader low. And the tasteful Western-themed environment is unfailingly 
clean and cheery, the staff trained and helpful, the menu and cocktail specials 
changed enough to keep things interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 For someone who abhors the formula restaurant as unoriginal and a chronic 
bore, I gladly nod my cap -- nay, my Texas wide-brim -- to Wood Ranch BBQ. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the single best reason to go is for the most popular entree: Tri Tip 
Roast ($10.95), or tri tip as few have ever seen it. It's a fatless, 
1.5-inch-thick mignon, a veritable bunker of meat wood-roasted outside and rosy 
within. It is tender, richly and smokily flavored, so plentiful that those 
capable of finishing it might wish to volunteer for a cardiac endurance study. 
Only its sauce -- a too-sweet, gutless, middle-of-the-road barbecue confection 
-- lacks punch, but then it seems sauce everywhere does nowadays. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-best on the menu does rank first, however, as best value. Baby back 
pork ribs -- a full, sprawling rack of Curly's of Iowa ribs, which means 
exceptionally sweet and tender and meaty -- costs just $12.95, a good 30% below 
fair-market price. Better still, they are in perfect shape: lightly, slowly 
roasted to preserve juice and flavor. But there's that sauce again. 
</P>
<P>
 Half barbecued chicken ($7.95), that of a very large chicken, was overcooked 
and dry on one visit and in very good, though still precooked, shape the next. 
Prime rib beef ribs ($8.50) also proved troublesome: as an all-you-can-eat 
special one night, the first batch was dry, slim in the pickings, tough from 
over-charring; but the follow-up batch, fewer in number, was generous and 
richly flavorsome in meat. Darn that sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 T-Bone porterhouse steak ($14.95), a 16-ouncer, was grilled perfectly as 
ordered, deeply flavored, and quite satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
 An appetizer not to be missed is Buffalo wings ($4.50). One of the country's 
foremost purveyors of this vinegar-edged, incendiary dishes is situated in St. 
Louis, and so judgment fell to a picky St. Louis dining compatriot who 
proclaimed our wings "perfect." I, rapturously lost in the embarrassingly tall 
pile of meaty wings before us, simply nodded. 
</P>
<P>
 Much ado is made here about shredded onions ($3.50), in which microfine onion 
shavings are breaded and fried, yielding a mound that looks like a huge curly 
brown wig. Sorry, I'll pass -- never before has the surface-to-vegetable frying 
ratio been higher. Worse, onion flavor was absent. A better appetizer is the 
Utah-sized chicken quesadilla ($5.95), nicely balanced in its white cheeses and 
green chilies. 
</P>
<P>
 Entrees are accompanied by a choice of sides, best among them a crisp 
Oriental-edged peanut coleslaw and heavy homemade-style mashed potatoes that 
bear the distinct flavor markings of creamed cheese. The fresh vegetable choice 
tended to be corn on the cob, often overcooked. Baked beans, if your hunger 
truly gapes, are nicely spiced and firm. Every table is laden with fresh garlic 
rolls salted, happily, without apology. 
</P>
<P>
 Beer always works well with pungent barbecue, but the scale and milder manners 
of Wood Ranch's meals may call out for wine. The list is small and reasonably 
priced, with all choices available by the glass. The Fetzer Valley Oaks 
Cabernet Sauvignon ($13.95 for the bottle, $4.25 for a glass) stood up well to 
most menu selections. (Note: This counsel might change if Wood Ranch BBQ were 
to do the right thing and offer diners the choice of a deeply spiced barbecue 
sauce.) 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, go to Wood Ranch BBQ hungry. Bring the kids. Ask about 
specials-of-the-night. And leave feeling, without guilt, as though you've 
gotten slightly more than you paid for. That's the plan. They've made it that 
way on purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 If you just can't escape embarrassment, order in. They deliver. Details

AT THE MARKET: GREENHOUSE AWASH IN SPECIALTY PRODUCE; F & F FARMS USES THE 
SOIL-FREE HYDROPONIC METHOD TO GROW SUCH GOURMET OFFERINGS AS ARUGULA, KALE AND 
BABY BOK CHOY. 
</P>

<P>
 Nestled among the rolling hills near Somis, Fred Ellrott Jr.'s greenhouse 
looksa heck of a lot like others dotting Ventura County's countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 The rectangular structure is made of transparent, corrugated fiberglass. Take 
a peak inside and it seems like a normal greenhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Row after tidy row of verdant plant life -- suspended on waist-high troughs -- 
blanket the entire 1/2-acre space. The appearance is that of a lush green 
carpet hovering above the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The collective drone from a bank of air-circulating fans can be heard. The 
temperature is cozy, a bit humid. The place smells like a greenhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet a faint, constant trickle of water -- nowhere to be seen -- breaks through 
the enclosure's stillness. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is totally different from conventional farming," Ellrott said recently, 
explaining the process of growing his vegetables hydroponically -- without 
soil. 
</P>
<P>
 That 24-hour trickle runs lengthwise down the four-inch-wide troughs -- 
concealed by the vegetation above -- and provides the plants with everything 
they need to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 The vegetables' roots are bathed in the nutrient-rich, recirculated solution. 
The 12-ingredient concoction includes powdered forms of calcium, potassium, 
iron and more. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to provide everything in the water that would come out of the 
ground," Ellrott said. 
</P>
<P>
 With a helping hand from his father, the duo's F & F Farms propagate specialty 
produce -- mainly leafy vegetables -- which they offer at farmers markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The greenhouse / farm is a year-round production site for gourmet lettuce, 
arugula, kale, tah tsai (Chinese cabbage), baby bok choy and even some spinach 
during the cooler months. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of these items go into our gourmet salad mix," Ellrott Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
 The family -- including Fred Jr.'s son, Fred Ellrott III -- can be found at 
farmers markets in Thousand Oaks, Ventura (Saturday), Santa Clarita and 
Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 Limestone lettuce, a delicate variety similar to butter lettuce, is Ellrott's 
main crop. The smallish, leafy heads have an uncanny likeness to large rose 
blooms. The single-packaged limestone lettuce heads sell for 75 cents each at 
the farmers markets; the gourmet salad mix is $3 for a 3/4-pound bag. Other 
items sell for about 50 cents to 60 cents per bunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since we control the environment, we can grow year-round," Ellrott Jr. said. 
And they can offer consumers a product they don't get from the major growers. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the key: grow specialty products that don't have to be planted 
outdoors, and have them available when others don't. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can only afford to sell high-end, specialty produce," Ellrott Sr. said 
during a recent tour of the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Jr. -- without prior farming experience -- entered Ventura County's 
hydroponic ranks in 1991. There are two other hydroponic farmers: Bob Beylik of 
Fillmore and Frank Armstrong of Somis. 
</P>
<P>
 Braving an economic tightrope has kept others from signing on to the no-soil 
farming method, longtime Ventura County farm adviser Bob Brendler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of interest in hydroponic farming quite a few years ago, but 
most weren't able to make a living at it," Brendler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellrott Jr. likens hydroponics to a production line. "From a production 
standpoint, this operates like a factory," he said.

EATS OF EDEN; BOUNTY HUNTERS FEAST THEIR EYES, ETC., ON THE HEAVENLY SPREADS OF 
THE BUFFET LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

weekly for The Times Orange County Edition.

<P>
 Consider the buffet, from humble steam table to grand hotel feast. Why is it 
we run wild at the very sight of one, as soon as we pick up a plate? 
</P>
<P>
 My first memorable buffet happened while I was an exchange student in 1970. In 
that year, I visited Stockholm's Operakalleren, home to the most lavish 
smorgasbord in Europe. Inside, amid the luxurious decor, I glimpsed the royally 
laden tables, then panic set in. No one had told me where to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 A kindly maitre d' saved the day. He saw my problem and stepped in, explaining 
the smorgasbord's proper etiquette. "First eat the iced dishes and smoked 
fish," he said, "then eat the cold dishes, composed salads and jellied meats." 
I took his advice, gratefully, working my way up to hot dishes such as dilled 
potatoes, Swedish meatballs, reindeer steak and beef with onions. The food was 
incredible, and I relished it, right up to the moment the bill arrived and I 
discovered I had blown two weeks' worth of expense money. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, I've had deck buffets aboard ships, breakfast buffets in Las Vegas 
and, this year, a terrific barbecue buffet at Maurice Bessinger's in 
Charleston, S.C., where unlimited platefuls of breaded catfish, Southern fried 
chicken and mustard-colored pork come to less than $6.  
</P>
<P>
 These days, I'm careful to do any buffet in several stages, combining dishes 
scientifically, so the foods don't clash. Unfortunately, er, I still eat too 
much. 
</P>
<P>
 What follows is only a small sampling of the buffets in our area, but I hope 
it's a good cross-section. Many types of restaurants, from Sizzler on up, have 
salad bars so complete they are effectively buffets themselves. In addition, 
upscale supermarkets such as Vons Pavilions and Irvine Ranch have special salad 
areas where customers can choose items and pay by the pound, making it easy to 
eat buffet-style at home. So enjoy, and remember to eat slowly. You can always 
go back for more. The Terrace Buffet at the Ritz-Carlton 
</P>
<P>
 The mother of all Orange County brunches is this outrageous, almost 
otherworldly buffet, which carries with it an astronomical price tag. Anyone 
looking for that big blowout or a truly celebratory experience should find this 
grand Sunday feast satisfies all requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Where outside Stockholm would you find a smoked fish and caviar bord like this 
one? There are three kinds of caviar, home-cured salmon, smoked mahi-mahi, 
trout and assorted fixings; cream cheese, chopped egg, capers, onions, blini, 
sour cream and a half dozen varieties of mini-bagels. That, by the way, is only 
a corner of this buffet. 
</P>
<P>
 On a sunny day, foods are layed out by the downstairs pool, and the tables 
appear to stretch almost endlessly. One table has fresh oysters and iced 
prawns, another Caesar salad tossed to order by a chef. How about an omelet man 
to cater to your every conceivable whim? You want roast meats, they've got 'em, 
hand-carved and plated with spicy, exotic chutneys. Try leg of lamb with the 
unctuous mango chutney, or garlic-and-herb-studded tenderloin of beef topped 
with a rich mushroom reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Breakfast meats and hot dishes are next: perfect eggs Benedict with a textbook 
Hollandaise and runny center yolk, spicy Italian sausage, braised chicken with 
shredded cabbage, tiny waffles accompanied by jars of real maple syrup. And 
don't forget the dessert buffet, overflowing with impossibly rich French 
pastries, tiramisu, rum babas and sauces. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel has a wine list loaded with an international selection of fine 
vintage wines, not to mention service that is snappy and professional. The 
buffet's clientele is well-heeled, but that doesn't stop a casual crowd from 
infiltrating. For those who want a taste but can't rationalize this much 
luxury, an abbreviated, more moderately priced buffet ($25) is served in the 
hotel's Lobby Lounge. 
</P>
<P>
 Ritz-Carlton Hotel, 33533 Ritz-Carlton Drive, Dana Point. (714) 240-5008. 
Buffet Sunday only, 10:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Adults, $38.50; children under 12, 
$19.25. All major cards accepted. Country Harvest Buffet 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at the other end of the pricing spectrum, there is Country Harvest 
Buffet, a growing new chain with three Orange County locations. The Costa Mesa 
store is bright, cheerful and almost always filled with families and seniors. 
It's safe to say there isn't much overlap between the crowd you bump into here 
and the one nibbling on caviar and oysters in Dana Point. Except, maybe, for 
the way both groups pile up their plates. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is no shortage of conviviality, from the cheerful hostesses who show 
you to your narrow, Formica-topped table, to the managers in white shirts (who 
minister to the food stations by remote microphone, making sure items are 
replenished when they run low). 
</P>
<P>
 And most of the people eating here seem quite happy. Because when it comes to 
bang for the buck, Country Harvest Buffet has to be called a bargain. Are there 
actually good things to eat here? Well, a few. Mostly, though, it is glorified 
cafeteria fare. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how it works. You stand in a line, sometimes a long one, to pay. 
Inside, you are free to hit the various food islands as often as you like. 
Anyone who has been to a casino buffet in Vegas should be familiar with this 
format. One island has cold salads such as ambrosia, corn salad and cole slaw; 
another has hot dishes, another is sumptuously laden with desserts.  
</P>
<P>
 Featured dishes change according to the day of the week: Fridays, for 
instance, it's Maryland crab cakes, clam chowder and fried shrimp; Saturdays, 
roast pork loin with apple prune dressing and barbecued beef ribs, among other 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 Most foods taste mass-produced, but there are exceptions. Pull a piece of corn 
bread from the center of the pan, and it will be fluffy and delicious, a fine 
complement for the house roast chicken, another good bet. The pork loin and 
apple prune dressing cannot be faulted, nor can roasted potatoes, blueberry 
muffins and roast beef. Avoid anything fried and especially anything posing as 
Italian.  
</P>
<P>
 For dessert, try chocolate fudge pudding cake, or better yet, the perfectly 
decent apple crisp. If you leave here hungry, you are even pickier than I. 
</P>
<P>
 Country Harvest Buffet has three O.C. locations: 1630 W. Katella Ave., 
Anaheim, (714) 539-2234; 2300 Harbor Blvd., Costa Mesa, (714) 631-2235; 1008 E. 
17th St., Santa Ana, (714) 541- 3020. Breakfast Saturday and Sunday, 8 to 11 
a.m.; lunch Monday through Friday, 10:45 a.m. to 2:45 p.m., and Saturday, 11:30 
a.m. to 2:45 p.m.; dinner Monday through Saturday, 3 to 9 p.m., and Sunday, 
11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. Breakfast is $5.49 ($4.99 for seniors); lunch, $5.39 
($4.89 for seniors); dinner, $6.89 ($6.05 for seniors). MasterCard and Visa 
accepted. New Seoul B.B.Q. Buffet 
</P>
<P>
 Korean cuisine is a natural for the buffet format, and this spotlessly clean 
Korean barbecue house has the most appealing format I've yet seen in an Asian 
restaurant. It's a quantum leap forward from the typically gruesome Chinese 
steam table buffet, where almost everything is fried in cornstarch or drenched 
in dark soy sauce. Furthermore, you get to do the cooking yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 The smiling waitresses take drink orders, turn on your individual charcoal 
braziers and bring you hot bean soup alongside a mound of steaming white rice. 
You then hit the buffet line, piling your plate with uncooked Korean meats and 
seafoods -- kalbi (short ribs), bulgogi (marinated beef), shrimp, eel, mussels, 
squid -- and vegetables like scallions, spinach, bean sprouts, pickled garlic 
and green salad. Plus fresh orange slices to refresh the palate. 
</P>
<P>
 Then you head to your table and place items in the middle of the brazier, 
cooking them up to your heart's desire. (Oh, but don't cook the chap chae , 
slippery cold noodles with sesame dressing. It's a side dish.) The quality and 
hygiene is top-notch, and it's all good fun.  
</P>
<P>
 Being that this is a Korean cuisine, expect that many of the proteins 
(especially spicy pork and the squid) will have been given an intense bath in 
garlic and chili. You will also find several of the cuisine's notoriously 
odoriferous kimchi (vegetables pickled with dried shrimp, hot pepper and 
garlic) on the restaurant's extensive condiment line, ones fashioned from 
cabbage, radish and more. Eat them with abandon, but be warned that the 
fruit-flavored gum you get at the cash register on your way out will not go a 
long way toward erasing the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 New Seoul B.B.Q. Buffet, 9902 Garden Grove Blvd., Garden Grove. (714) 
537-9902. Lunch Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.; dinner Monday through 
Friday, 3 to 10:30 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday, 11 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. Lunch, 
$6.50; dinner, $10.95. MasterCard and Visa accepted. Marmac's 
</P>
<P>
 This is a dark, clubby restaurant with real brick walls, semicircular black 
booths and softly tinkling cocktail piano music; in short, the sort of ambience 
popularized by Velvet Turtle during the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 From the restaurant's fortress-like exterior, it is the last place you'd ever 
expect to find a toqued chef ladling out brown gravy. But that's what awaits 
you (unless you decide to order a la carte from the menu, which is 
predominantly steak and seafood). 
</P>
<P>
 What makes Marmac's special is the hand-carved prime rib -- a good one -- 
included in this buffet. A carving chef will cleave a thick pink slab, oozing 
juices, off a huge standing rib roast. You get to enjoy it with good trimmings, 
too: terrific, yeasty rolls, spinach salad with a fine hot bacon dressing, even 
whole baked potatoes, steaming in their foil wrappers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pass on most of the filler, though. The tired-looking salad bar, for instance, 
is composed of things like cold pastas and runny cole slaw, while three or four 
dishes like dry roast chicken or starchy, overly creamy fettuccine with seafood 
make up the hot section. For what it is worth, Marmac's changes these dishes 
daily, though the prime rib is available every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Desserts are equally uninspiring, save one. Amid the sheet cakes and milk 
powder puddings, you'll find a small freezer stocked with Carnation vanilla ice 
cream. Scoop yourself some, then top it with Hershey's chocolate syrup and 
multicolored sprinkles. At these prices, you'll swear you've walked into your 
own party. 
</P>
<P>
 Marmac's, 12777 Knott St., Garden Grove. (714) 898-5645. Lunch Monday through 
Saturday, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., and Sunday, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.; dinner Monday 
through Saturday, 4 to 10 p.m., and Sunday, 3:30 to 10 p.m. Lunch buffet is 
$5.95. Dinner buffet: Monday through Wednesday, $6.95 (without prime rib) or 
$12.95 (with); Thursday through Sunday, $9.95 (without prime rib) or $12.95 
(with). American Express, MasterCard and Visa accepted. The Clay Oven 
</P>
<P>
 The lunch buffet has long been a standard in Indian restaurants, partly to 
bolster business for the evening trade, and partly because these curries and 
stewed vegetable dishes are well suited to the steam table. 
</P>
<P>
 Praveen Bansal's Clay Oven is one of the most pleasant of the county's Indian 
restaurants, giving excellent value for the dollar. It's a cheerful, elegant 
little room stuck in the middle of an Irvine mini-mall, uncharacteristically 
(for an Indian restaurant) doubling as a showcase gallery for local artists. 
During lunch, the restaurant is well lit, and the management plays soft ragas 
over a sound system. No wonder so many patrons linger well past the lunch hour. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll find the usual suspects on this buffet line, but they are done with 
atypical lightness and flavor. There is always chicken from the tandoor -- the 
restaurant's eponymous clay oven -- at least one green vegetable dish and 
mounds of fluffy basmati rice. The day I sampled the buffet, there were stewed 
yellow lentils, curried chicken, spinach with potato, a refreshing yogurt dip 
called raita , several kinds of fresh cut vegetables, hot flat bread from the 
oven and a creamy, almond-rich rice pudding for dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 Sundays, when the Indian clientele comes out in force, the buffet includes 
fruits and an expanded vegetarian section. The good news is that the price 
remains the same all week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clay Oven, 15435 Jeffrey Road, Irvine. (714) 552-2851. Lunch buffet served 
daily, 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. $6.50. American Express, MasterCard and Visa 
accepted. Souplantation 
</P>
<P>
 In my view, this is the best of the chains doing soup, salad and pasta 
buffets. You don't get as much protein for your dollar as you do at a Country 
Harvest Buffet, but according to nutritionists, you don't really need that 
much. Furthermore, any time I've eaten in a Souplantation, the food has been 
fresh and high quality. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, hot pastas were added to the already bountiful format, which has 
always included a variety of cold pastas such as shrimp tarragon with a rich 
mayonnaise-based dressing. Sauces and pasta shapes change weekly; the last time 
I visited I found a hearty salsa Bolognese as well as marinara and a creamy 
primavera Alfredo, all waiting to douse my radiatore and linguine. 
</P>
<P>
 The long salad bar is the base of operations for many people who come here, 
and it invariably has several types of greens, 10 dressings, 11 "fresh cuts" or 
fresh vegetables, eight prepared salads such as the pastas, herbed barley salad 
and carrot-raisin salad, plus prepared salads, which could be sesame-flavored 
won-ton chicken or Caesar. At the soup station, chili, chicken noodle and clam 
chowder are the standbys, available every day. A vegetarian soup such as black 
bean or minestrone is always available, too, plus a wild card soup that might 
be anything: cream of broccoli, Irish potato leek . . . you get the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to this great blueberry muffins, two kinds of Italian focaccia, fruits, 
puddings, yogurts, soft-serve ice cream, several fat-free choices and at dinner 
only, a baked potato bar, and you've got something for everyone.

CLASSIC OF THE WEEK: ROY ELDRIDGE WITH THE GENE KRUPA ORCHESTRA FEATURING ANITA 
O'DAY "UPTOWN" (1941-49) COLUMBIA  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BUDDY SEIGAL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trumpeter Eldridge, drummer Krupa and singer O'Day number among the giants, so 
it's no surprise that the hot licks abound on these recordings -- even if the 
material is more commercial pop/swing than real jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, even if they did play their most important and enduring work elsewhere, 
it's nonetheless a pleasure to hear these three together, particularly the 
exchanges between O'Day and Eldridge as she exhorts him to "blow, man, blow!" 
and enthuses "root, and solid to boot!" (Note should be taken that such close 
work between a white female and a black male was in and of itself something of 
a watershed in '40s Amer ica.)Light-years ahead of his time and second only to 
Louis Armstrong in terms of pre-bop influence, Eldridge plays beautiful upper 
register solos that sing and sear (check out his especially lyrical rendition 
of "Rockin' Chair"). 
</P>
<P>
 O'Day, meanwhile, gives glimpses of her true talent for scat singing with hip, 
restrained phrasing even on the corniest material. And Krupa, always incredibly 
powerful, thunders like a tommy gun throughout. BUDDY SEIGAL

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK: BILL LLOYD "SET TO POP" ESD  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is one of those pure-pop delights that seems to come along only once 
every couple of years. The 15 tracks here were recorded in dribs and drabs over 
the last several years while Bill Lloyd, half of the late-'80s country duo 
Foster and Lloyd, spent most of his time writing for other singers in one of 
Nashville's numerous song factories. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the hodgepodge manner in which it came together nor his country 
background prepare you for the many charms of this solo effort. It's as catchy 
as flypaper, with enough hooks to spook a whole school of tuna. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd's pop-music touchstones are as old as Buddy Holly, as formidable as the 
Beatles and as recent as Marshall Crenshaw, who, not coincidentally, makes a 
cameo appearance on the opening track, "I Went Electric."  
</P>
<P>
 He can suck you into a song like "In the Line of Fire" with an enigmatic 
opening verse: "She likes the way I listen / Ignores my indecision / Telling me 
things I don't want to know." 
</P>
<P>
 In "Trampoline," he holds the listener with musical allusions to twang guitar 
king Duane Eddy and to the Rebels' "Wild Weekend" (upon which the Cars pretty 
much based its entire career), all tossed in so casually they seem spontaneous. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a Perfect World" is one of several tunes that could serve as a primer in 
canny lyric writing. And anybody who can quote a classic Three Stooges routine 
as cleverly as Lloyd does (in the misspelled "Niagra Falls") can never be 
accused of taking himself too seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 The subjects are fairly basic: yearning to fall in love, falling in love, 
falling out of love. But to paraphrase that old popmeister Ira Gershwin: It's 
got rhythm, it's got music and, in the unexpectedly thought-provoking 
"Channeling the King," it's got Elvis. Who could ask for anything more? RANDY 
LEWIS

WANNA DANCE?: SUNDAYS HERE ARE STRICTLY BALLROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES, Rose Apodaca Jones is a free-lance writer who 
contributes regularly to The Times Orange County Edition.

<P>
 * Big Band at the West Coast Club 
</P>
<P>
 * In the Waterfront Hilton, 21100 Pacific Coast Highway, Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * (714) 960-7873.  
</P>
<P>
 * Sundays only, 6 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cover: $3. 
</P>
<P>
 The mellow grooves of reggae invading almost every club on Sundays might be a 
perfect way to wind down the weekend, but for some it lacks the kick needed to 
jump-start the week. For this crowd it's strictly ballroom on the seventh day 
-- swing, cha-chas, even hot tangos -- as offered at the West Coast Club in the 
Waterfront Hilton, Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 So what if the average age of these Big Band fans is almost triple that of 
reggae lovers seen frequenting the local clubs? For many, this is their second 
stop of the day. Like the afternoon soiree at the Red Lion Hotel in Costa Mesa, 
the Waterfront gig is hosted by Elda Barry, former Mrs. Senior America and, to 
regulars, a lady who knows how to party. Barry has been organizing both events 
for the last three years, encouraging seniors -- especially single ones -- to 
spend their Sundays dancing to American classics. 
</P>
<P>
 The live orchestra of the Red Lion is missing here, an element that Barry has 
been trying to persuade the Hilton to add to the program. But that doesn't seem 
to bother many of the patrons, some of whom say they even prefer the recorded 
originals offered nonstop by deejay Cameron Hollis, who spins the likes of 
Benny Goodman, Prez Prado and plenty of Frank Sinatra throughout the set, 
including the latter's duet with U2's Bono. 
</P>
<P>
 The first hour features ballroom dance lessons by Joe Duran, who specializes 
in patience as well as Latin dances. He can work with several couples of 
various skills at once and is available for tips long after class is over. It's 
a perfect opportunity to learn to really dance -- for the low cover price of $3 
-- even if you think you're too young for this scene. Ballroom dancing, after 
all, only gets better and more fun with age. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you've got two left feet, you can enjoy just watching the regulars. The 
evening gig at the Hilton draws considerably fewer folks than you'll find at 
the Red Lion, but that also means there's more room here to strut your stuff -- 
which patrons take full advantage of. 
</P>
<P>
 Champagne, at $2 a glass, gets poured often. There are also well drinks and 
wine at $4 a glass and frozen cocktails for $5. Domestic beer is $2.75 for 
draft, $3.25 a bottle; imports are $3.75 bottle.

COMEDY; A WOMAN'S PLACE IS ON STAGE; TWO HEADLINERS TAKE MEN, SOCIETY TO TASK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN DOGGRELL, Glenn Doggrell writes about comedy for The Times Orange 
County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a recent interview, a female comedian was mentioning how tough it is to 
achieve headliner status and how many clubs are reluctant to book female 
comics. Generally, a check of local club schedules bears her out. But not this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Headlining at Fullerton's Standing Room Only through Sunday is Margaret Smith, 
while at the Irvine Improv, Diana Jordan is the main act Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are funny enough to top a bill, but the similarities mostly end there. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan, energetic and all over the stage, prides herself on giving women a 
distinctive voice, particularly pointing out male shortcomings. Smith, with the 
deadpan delivery of a career grouch, speaks for everybody, lamenting society's 
sorry state in general. 
</P>
<P>
 The dry-witted Smith has come a long way since she started doing stand-up in 
New York in the early '80s, when a club owner asked her not to come back, even 
though she was working for free. Combining talent and perseverance, the Chicago 
native eventually landed late-night spots with Letterman and Leno as well as 
movie roles in "Goodfellas" and a remake of "The Blob." 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, she honed this semi-signature bit about her father, whom she 
describes in her act as a vain, alcoholic gambler. 
</P>
<P>
 "So one day he gave up his vices to save enough money for a hair transplant. 
Then, after the transplant was complete, he got drunk, and on a $20 bet, shaved 
his head. . . . So I guess I owe him $20." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides her father, Smith's act touches on her dysfunctional family, being in 
therapy, women's health care and politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan's routine isn't so eclectic. She's more concerned with man's inhumanity 
to woman. Men, she contends, need help. And luckily for them, she gives advice 
freely. 
</P>
<P>
 Her recently published book, "A Wife's Little Instruction Book," has several 
tips to make a relationship succeed, including: 
</P>
<P>
 * "If his wallet contains more pictures of his kids than of Ben Franklin, Abe 
Lincoln and George Washington, that means his ex-wife got all their pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Don't marry a man who refers to the rehearsal dinner as 'The Last Supper.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan, who was nominated for "Best Female Stand-Up Comedian" in 1991's 
American Comedy Awards, turned to jokes in the early '80s when she found the 
asides she was slipping in between her songs in Las Vegas casinos were getting 
better responses than the songs. 
</P>
<P>
 In Irvine, she will be performing "Female, Fertile and Frustrated," her 
one-woman show that features comedy with a bit of singing and dancing mixed in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to do a one-woman show, something different than just stand-up," she 
told The Times last autumn. "I wanted something that would show my acting 
skills." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to writing (she's also planning on turning "Female, Fertile and 
Frustrated" into a book) and doing comedy, Jordan is working on a sitcom for 
CBS this spring. The show is based on her "Female, Fertile and Frustrated" 
character.

KID STUFF: BIRDS IN THE HAND; ORIGAMI SYMBOLIZES LIFE AFTER THE BOMB IN 'ONE 
THOUSAND CRANES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, Corinne Flocken is a free-lance writer who regularly covers 
Kid Stuff for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Think of a crane, and you may picture a stately bird standing by the water's 
edge or rising toward the clouds with powerful, measured wing strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cultures, the crane represents much more. For example, according to 
"Man, Myth & Magic: The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Mythology, Religion and the 
Unknown," Irish legends once ascribed supernatural qualities to the bird, and 
some early Greek and Roman writers considered the crane to be a symbol of 
supreme vigilance. 
</P>
<P>
 In Colin Thomas' "One Thousand Cranes," the crane is also held up as a symbol, 
only in this case, the bird is made of paper. Based in part on the true story 
of a young Japanese girl afflicted with radiation-induced leukemia nine years 
after the bombing of Hiroshima, this drama for young audiences finds the 
central character, Sadako Sasaki, folding 1,000 origami cranes to symbolize her 
wish for health and a long life. At the end of the play, audience members are 
invited to continue the job that Sadako could not complete (the child died in 
1954), and through that, voice their own concerns for world peace. 
</P>
<P>
 South Coast Repertory's Young Conservatory Players present "One Thousand 
Cranes" Saturday through June 19 on SCR's Second Stage in Costa Mesa. After the 
hourlong performance, the 11-year-old actress who plays Sadako (Kristy Wu) will 
return to the stage to encourage audience members to fold their own cranes and 
send them to the children's monument in the Hiroshima Peace Park in Japan, 
where thousands of origami cranes are left by visitors as a symbol for their 
desire for peace. (Origami paper, folding instructions and the park's mailing 
address will be included with the show programs.) 
</P>
<P>
 "One Thousand Cranes" premiered in Vancouver's Green Thumb Theatre for Young 
People in 1983; it was performed by a Japanese theater company in Tokyo in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
 American audiences had their first look at "One Thousand Cranes" in 1986 when 
it was toured through the Mark Taper Forum's Improvisational Theatre Project 
(now called PLAY, or Performing for Los Angeles Youth). In 1988 and '89, the 
Taper took it to three international arts festivals, including the 
International Assn. of Theater for Children and Youth Festival in the then 
Soviet Union. The show, which addresses children's concerns about nuclear war, 
was also performed at the Kennedy Center Theater Lab. 
</P>
<P>
 YCP director Diane Doyle said that to her knowledge, the Young Conservatory 
Players' staging of the show is the first ever attempted by young actors. 
Instead of four adults handling multiple roles, Doyle uses eight children, most 
of them students in SCR's Young Conservatory theater training program. Four of 
the children act as storytellers, helping young audiences keep pace with the 
tale through its 16 scenes (the transitions are further aided by original music 
by Michael Silversher and Dwight Richard Odle's inventive, three-level set, she 
said). Two adults from the theater's Adult Conservatory also appear in the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 "One Thousand Cranes" is actually two stories with a common theme, said Doyle. 
The first, set in 1950s Hiroshima, follows Sadako, her mother and her best 
friend as they come to terms with the girl's illness and impending death. 
Sadako's leukemia was linked to radiation exposure she suffered as a toddler in 
Hiroshima, where the first atomic bomb dropped on a populated area devastated 
the city Aug. 6, 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this, Doyle says that the play is not political in nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no discussion of who was responsible for dropping the bomb," she 
said. "It's more, 'This is what a bomb can do.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Running parallel to this is the story of Buddy, a 1980s toy gun-toting "G.I. 
Joe freak" (played by 11-year-old Morgan Johnston). Set "somewhere in the 
U.S.," Buddy's scenes focus on his transition from an obsession with war games 
to a growing awareness of and concern about real nuclear war. By the end of the 
show, Buddy has become an advocate for peace and is rallying his schoolmates to 
do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no connection between the two characters, said Doyle, but together 
they deliver a pertinent message about the hazards of war and suggest viable 
ways children can work toward world harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 The play addresses serious subjects, but there are humorous moments as well, 
said Doyle. She adds that children as young as 5 or 6 will be able to grasp the 
hopeful message the show imparts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Death and war are topics that kids worry about, but I don't think (the play) 
is too scary at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you do a play like this, you have to say, 'Here's the problem . . . and 
here's an alternative, here's what to do.' There's a hopefulness to it, big 
time. You leave the play feeling good."

DO IT!: PIG OUT, PEDAL, THEN PIG OUT SOME MORE

 Pig Out and Pedal, a favorite event among local road hogs for a decade, 
returns Sunday with the promise of plenty of good riding and what organizers 
call "the best burrito this side of the border." 
</P>
<P>
 The 11th annual event is a non-competitive ride with courses ranging from 13 
to 75 miles. Along with the riding comes plenty of food, with sandwiches, 
fruit, cookies, muffins, bagels and candy (and bottled water) offered at rest 
stops along the routes. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who choose to stick around after their ride can (for an extra $5.50) 
partake in a lunch of burritos stuffed with flame-barbecued chicken, refried 
beans, cheese, guacamole, lettuce and tomato. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an athletic event predicated on the belief that exercise doesn't have to 
involve denial. Evidently, it's a popular concept -- the organizers at Dimo 
Cycling of Newport Beach expect as many as 3,000 riders. 
</P>
<P>
 The road courses cover a variety of terrain. The 13-mile course is a quick 
out-and-back jaunt to the first rest station. Next up the distance scale, the 
25-mile course is a relatively flat ramble around Anaheim Hills, Orange and 
Villa Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Scenic, rolling roads through some of the county's last undeveloped land 
highlight the 50-mile route. The 75-mile course winds through such areas as 
Santiago Canyon and Rancho Santa Margarita, offering some climbs in addition to 
the miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Starts will be staggered for the event. Organizers have arranged for roving 
mechanical support along the routes. Participants will get an event T-shirt and 
will be eligible for prizes in a random drawing. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Maxximum 5K and 10K run returns for its second go-round Sunday in Laguna 
Niguel, starting at the Plaza de La Paz shopping center, 27271 La Paz Road. 
Start times are 7:30 a.m. for the 5K and 8:30 a.m. for the 10K; registration is 
$18. The event is a benefit for South County Safe Rides, which provides a safe, 
confidential ride home for any student who has been drinking or is with someone 
who has been drinking. Information on the run: (714) 831-8293. 
</P>
<P>
 What: Pig Out and Pedal bike ride. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Sunday, June 12, beginning at 7:30 a.m. (registration, 6:30 to 8:30 
a.m.). 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Starts at Yorba Regional Park, Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: From the Riverside (91) Freeway, exit north at Imperial Highway 
and turn right at La Palma Avenue and go about three miles to the park 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: Entry is $30, including T-shirt; $20 for kids under 12. Lunch is 
$5.50 extra.

SURFING; HAVING A BALL CELEBRATING 'SUMMER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rick Fignetti and David Reyes, Rockin' Fig is Rick Fignetti, a Huntington 
Beach surfer/shop owner. Times staff writer David Reyes has reported on U.S. 
surf teams competing in Bali and Brazil. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With Rockin' Fig away in Ventura protecting his No. 1 amateur ranking in 
senior men's last weekend, I represented us at the fifth annual Waterman's Ball 
in Costa Mesa. The event, sponsored by the Surf Industry Manufacturers Assn. 
(SIMA), raised $175,000 for three ocean preservation groups and honored 
filmmaker Bruce Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the first "The Endless Summer" 30 years ago, I've been wanting to 
meet this guy. He directed that movie and the newly released "The Endless 
Summer II." 
</P>
<P>
 What does he look like? Fig asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, he's 56 years old and, in typical surfer fashion, dresses awkwardly. He 
wore a tired-looking blue blazer with stripes over a frayed Hawaiian shirt. And 
he wore sandals. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, how was the Waterman's Ball? Did they have all these celebrities?  
</P>
<P>
 Yeah. Ted Danson was there. I saw Robert August, who starred in Brown's first 
"Endless Summer" film. Dale Velzy got up on stage, and so did Laguna Beach 
filmmaker Greg MacGillivray, who presented Brown with the Waterman's 
Achievement Award. Apparently, Greg Noll had taken his crew to Bali, so some of 
surfing's pioneers couldn't show up. 
</P>
<P>
 But they had these people all suited up, huh?  
</P>
<P>
 Yup. It was major dressy. Most women were poured into tight black things. For 
guys, it was pure Southern California eclectic: from power suits to wild 
Hawaiian floral shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 You should have met this guy Bruce Brown, Fig. He was a classic. There ain't a 
shred of Hollywood on him. 
</P>
<P>
 Did you ask him if there's gonna be an "Endless Summer III?"  
</P>
<P>
 Naw. Maybe if there is one, it could be directed by his son, Dana Brown, 34, 
who accompanied his dad to the Waterman's Ball. Dana said he co-wrote and 
co-edited "The Endless Summer II" and was a cameraman on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Brown what the response has been to his movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "We heard that they're liking it," Brown had said. "It's a positive movie, and 
I think it's good for surfing." 
</P>
<P>
 Do you think the movie is symbolic of a rite of passage?  
</P>
<P>
 "I think the media tends to over-analyze movies. This is simple. It's just a 
simple, upbeat movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "As for a message? Naw. I don't think that as I was in the editing room I said 
to myself, 'Oh, here's a message.' " 
</P>
<P>
 SIMA president Tom Knapp, president of Irvine-based Club Sportswear, was 
ecstatic with the benefit. He said that SIMA doubled its fund-raising amount 
this year to $175,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our biggest event of the year," Knapp said. "And, this has GONE OFF!" 
</P>
<P>
 A live and silent auction were held. Some of the hot items bid on included a 
trip for two to the Fijian island of Tavarua, a walk-on part in the TV show 
"Baywatch" and "Mad About You," and tons of custom surfboards. 
</P>
<P>
 Danson represented the American Oceans Campaign, which will, with the San 
Clemente-based Surfrider Foundation and the Orange County Marine Institute, 
receive a portion of the $175,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Contests: Rob Machado of Cardiff won the Marui Pro world tour contest in Japan 
on May 29. Australian Dave Macaulay was second, and Florida's Kelly Slater 
finished third. 
</P>
<P>
 That jumped Machado into second in the world tour ratings, behind Slater. Two 
guys from the U.S.A. leading the world standings. That's pretty good.  
</P>
<P>
 Endless: Fig's friends said they saw "The Endless Summer II" and liked it. 
Some said they want to see it again. They liked the idea in the movie of 
meeting the top pros at different places all around the world. I heard there 
are some killer waves in it.  
</P>
<P>
 Fig, you eager to see the movie? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, I'm ready. But I'm waiting for the crowds to thin down. I heard Cape St. 
Francis, the place where the perfect waves were found in the first "Endless 
Summer" movie, has changed. It has a bunch of houses there now.  
</P>
<P>
 Opening: Waterman Surf Art Gallery opens its second location tonight from 5:30 
to 9 p.m. at 554 Huntley St., near Melrose Avenue in West Hollywood. For more 
information, contact James or Diane Wilson, (310) 273-5041. 
</P>
<P>
 Searching: Anyone have an original Brue Pomeroy surfboard? Todd Paul Miller of 
Irvine is willing to pay $1,000 for a BP long board in good condition. They 
were made in 1962-63 by Lynn Pomeroy in Capistrano Beach. For more information, 
contact Miller at (714) 251-6595.

KIDS ON FILM: 'ENDLESS SUMMER II': IT SURFS MOST OF THOSE DUDES RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Lynn Smith is a staff writer for The Times' Life & Style 
section. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "The Endless Summer II," old-time surfer-filmmaker Bruce Brown follows 
adolescent surfer dudes Wingnut and Patrick around the world as they retrace 
his steps in his 1964 quest for the world's gnarliest wave, revisit cult surf 
heroes and pass out in the sand after totally tubular parties. (Rated PG-13)  
</P>
<P>
 Thirty years is a long time, culturally speaking. The kids who came to watch 
this nostalgic sequel weren't born when the cult classic first came out. Can 
they relate? 
</P>
<P>
 Absolutely -- if they're guys, if they surf, or if they like buddy movies. 
Otherwise, you have to like travelogues with lots of shots of surf, surf 
riders, skimpy bathing suits near the surf or corny, surf-related commentary. 
(Example: animals in exotic habitats watching surfers are heard thinking, "I 
smell short-boarders.") 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Baezwinkelman, an 11-year-old who missed the first "The Endless Summer," 
was taken aback by the documentary format. "I thought it was going to be mostly 
a story and not really an autobiography," he said. "It's mostly somebody else 
telling the story and watching two other people doing what they want to do. But 
I still liked it. It was pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 He had come to see another movie but ran into a dozen schoolmates who, helmets 
and roller-blades in hand, decided to do some male bonding, sixth-grader style, 
at the surf movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Most agreed with Chris Hendricks, also 11, that you had to be into surfing to 
get it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't surf, you wouldn't like it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot, a lot of surfing," added Jeff Hegness, 12.  
</P>
<P>
 The scenery -- of Costa Rica, France, South Africa, Fiji and Indonesia -- 
interested Jeff, who said he had just been studying the continents. "We knew 
some of the towns and stuff, and it was really neat to see them, like Cape Town 
in South Africa."  
</P>
<P>
 But if, as this movie suggests, the surf culture hasn't changed, the rest of 
the world has surely changed around it. To bedeck a Zulu in surf garb or to 
complain that no one on an Indonesian fishing boat speaks English seems 
churlish now. 
</P>
<P>
 And while narrator Brown explains in the beginning that many girls have taken 
to the waves, women are mostly absent from the rest of the movie except in 
bars, or as topless bathers whose "zoomers" make the boys lose their 
concentration on the waves.  
</P>
<P>
 Please. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris, a surfer who goes to surf contests and subscribes to Surfer magazine, 
said he preferred the original "Endless Summer." That movie, which cost $50,000 
to shoot, appeared more as if it had been filmed by the two globe-hopping surf 
buddies. 
</P>
<P>
 In this one, which cost $3.4 million, the buddies are clearly backed up by a 
substantial crew. When, for instance, they are surrounded by lions and their 
car runs out of gas, you wonder how much danger are they really in if the crew 
keeps on filming.  
</P>
<P>
 "The reason I liked the other one better," he said, "is that they were both 
kids and they were just doing it for the fun of it. They weren't doing it for 
the money. They just took a camera out there and did it. It was an original 
idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, he said, he liked the idea of seeking and finding the perfect wave. 
This time, the thrills were there, but the magic was gone.

THE RITZ: A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF OLD-STYLE FINE DINING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's Friday evening, and we're at the Ritz smack on time for our 6:30 
reservation. Only it turns out the main dining room is booked for the next 
three hours. Unless we want to wait until 9:30, we are informed, we have just 
two seating choices: the jampacked bar, where pipe and cigar smoking are 
permitted, or a hidden rear room. We take the art-filled, rather claustrophobic 
room in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who says fine dining is dead need only show up here on a busy night. 
The Ritz is still a bastion of old-style fine dining, not only in terms of food 
but also in its classic appointments (gilt-edged mirrors, black-leather 
booths), and it enjoys vigorous health. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that some things haven't changed around here. For one thing, the 
waitresses are no longer obliged to wear hot pants, I am told, though most seem 
to be wearing them anyway. For another, owner Hans Prager has yanked many of 
the controversial oil paintings that long decorated this place -- mostly female 
nudes in supine postures -- replacing them with gaudy, colorful prints by the 
French artist Guy Buffet. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the food, Prager hired the talented Claude Koeberle, formerly of Mille 
Fleurs in Rancho Santa Fe, to take over his kitchen last summer. And just six 
weeks ago, the restaurant started opening for Sunday dinner after being closed 
Sundays for 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently a reader's poll in Conde Nast Traveler named the Ritz the 13th best 
restaurant in the country (Le Bec Fin of Philadelphia finished first) and No. 1 
overall in service. That is an incredible vote of confidence and gives you an 
idea how pampered you feel when dining here. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it subtly validates Prager's taste in art as well. Not all the 
artfully racy paintings are gone -- the dining area behind the bar is still 
lined with them -- and Conde Nast Traveler readers apparently approve. 
</P>
<P>
 I've been eating at the Ritz often during the last month or two and enjoying 
it more than I have in previous years. Prager's idea of good food has always 
been synonymous with opulence. Where else but here, for instance, could you 
find a dish like the carousel -- a lazy Susan of gravlax, prawns, Dungeness 
crab legs, lobster medallions, duck liver pate, filet of smoked trout, 
prosciutto, steak tartare (of filet mignon) and herring marinated in sour 
cream? No matter that these ingredients are, by themselves, tasty. Lucullus 
himself would reel at the prospect of all this richesse.  
</P>
<P>
 When you order simply, though, some of this cooking can be quite a pleasure 
even to moderate appetites. This is particularly true at lunch, when crab 
cakes, mussels and Cobb salad can be ordered as entrees. 
</P>
<P>
 The crisp Dungeness crab cakes come with an eccentric celery root-apple slaw 
and a creamy, slightly spicy remoulade sauce. During my last lunch here, I ate 
two of these golden brown cakes, washing them down with one of the restaurant's 
trademark frozen martinis -- a mini-decanter full to the brim with Bombay 
Sapphire gin. The experience makes me fantasize that I'm power-lunching among 
senators at some Capitol Hill hot spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The mussels used here aren't the bland, green-lipped variety from New Zealand 
but tiny, delicate cultured mussels from Prince Edward Island, Canada. You get 
an entire panful, submerged in their blue-black shells by a good, if mildly 
overboard, broth based on vermouth, garlic, shallots, tomatoes and cream. As 
for the Cobb salad, the Ritz serves this Southern California classic (chopped 
avocado, bacon, tomatoes, blue cheese, chicken and greens) in a big wooden 
bowl, and it is certainly the equal of any I've ever tasted. 
</P>
<P>
 But when you come for dinner, you find the cooking can still get as bogged 
down in excess as ever. Take the osso buco , an enormous shank of prime veal, 
fork-tender and beautiful to behold. Why couldn't the Ritz just serve it with 
the kitchen's fine-leaf spinach, instead of fussing up the plate with 
over-sauced, overcooked pasta and a heap of mushy polenta? 
</P>
<P>
 One evening a special of soft-shell crabs came in a heavy batter coating. 
Without that, the crabs might have been delightful. The prime culotte steak can 
be tough and overdone (the one dish served here that I would actually call 
substandard). Roast duck in the Bavarian manner is a particularly fine bird, 
served on a plate full of extras: warm apples, sweet and sour red cabbage, 
lingonberry sauce and spaetzle dumplings. All the side dishes taste fine on 
their own; lumped together, they cloy rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, I would like all this food more if it were lighter, but the 
prospects of that happening are slight. Chef Koeberle may have introduced a 
certain degree of lighter cooking, but it's not by chance that the main dining 
room is dominated by a portrait of Auguste Escoffier, the early 20th Century 
chef who codified French cuisine for decades to come in all its focus on butter 
and cream (the room is actually called the Escoffier Room). Hans Prager himself 
learned to cook in this style at the old Waldorf Astoria in New York, and he 
has said he wants to give customers their money's worth. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who finds the restaurant pricey, by the way, should take note of the 
chance to dine here on Sunday. On Sunday evenings only, complete three-course 
dinners are available for $24.50. 
</P>
<P>
 One Sunday, my wife and I dined in high style at a reasonable price. The first 
course offered two choices (cream of asparagus soup or a cold, crisp Romaine 
lettuce heart with Roquefort dressing), the second course four (Canadian 
halibut, Lake Superior whitefish, pork rib chops or lamb sirloin). At dessert, 
there was a fine sampler. 
</P>
<P>
 Dessert, by the way, is one place where Koeberle does seem to have lightened 
things up. There is now a wonderful raspberry creme brulee, an almond-crusted 
pear tart with caramel sauce and a five-layer chocolate fantasy to go along 
with Ritz classics such as harlequin souffle (Grand Marnier and chocolate) and 
profiteroles (chocolate-coated ice cream puffs). 
</P>
<P>
 The Ritz is expensive. Appetizers and salads are $4.50 to $12.50. Entrees are 
$17.50 to $28. THE RITZ

PARKER'S PLACE: YEARS OF CHANGE UNFOLD AT PLAYBOY MANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. JEFFERSON PARKER, T. Jefferson Parker is a novelist and writer who lives 
in Orange County. His column appears in OC Live! the first three Thursdays of 
every month.

<TEXT>
<P>
 I remember hiding under a tree at the Guinn Foss Elementary School playground 
in Tustin in the first grade, trying to lie so low the teacher wouldn't see me 
when she blew the whistle for the end of recess. Beside me was my best friend, 
Rick, snickering into the tallish unmowed grass around that tree. Mission 
accomplished, we'd have a few minutes of guilty satisfaction before Mrs. Cooley 
came out to bust us. During those minutes, we'd fantasize that someday, when we 
were grown, we'd live in a cave on a mountaintop and become photographers for 
Playboy magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither of us did anything of the kind. Rick became a golf pro, and I turned 
out to be a writer. I can't operate any camera more complicated than a Kodak 
Fiesta 35 -- which is made of cardboard and has the instructions printed on it 
-- and doubt if Rick can, either. The Playboy angle, of course, meant nothing 
more than we wanted to consort with beautiful women, and we each were blessed 
to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
 When I was a boy growing up in the '50s and '60s, Playboy was a forbidden 
item, though most boys on our block had relatively easy access to their 
fathers' collections. The trick was to check them out in secret, then replace 
them such that Dad couldn't tell you'd been prying into his personal library, 
an act almost impossible for a 10-year-old. I recall the doomed feeling with 
which I put away one issue that clearly bore my chocolate-loaded thumbprint on 
its cover. 
</P>
<P>
 At any rate, both Playboy magazine and I were first issued in December, 1953 
(the same year the Corvette was born). Playboy's centerfold was Marilyn Monroe; 
mine was a neat little innie with symmetrical spokes that still collect lint. 
Both the magazine and I are 40 years old now -- always a handy time to take 
stock, look back, look ahead. I recently went to the Playboy Mansion in Los 
Angeles for the first time and looked forward to meeting Hugh Hefner. 
</P>
<P>
 The occasion was part of the annual American Booksellers Assn. convention, an 
epic publishing bazaar that took place this year in Los Angeles. Playboy's 
reason for the party was to note its 40th year of publishing and to introduce 
its latest book, "The Playboy Book -- Forty Years." I got invited because 
Playboy's West Coast editor, a fine gentleman by the name of Steve Randall, is 
an acquaintance. 
</P>
<P>
 I looked forward to the party very much. I got a haircut, rented a white 
dinner jacket and a car and driver and stocked my Igloo cooler with snacks and 
canned cocktails so my companion and I could get festive on the way up to the 
mansion. At the entrance the driver barked out my name to the guardians and, 
lo, it was on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 Once on the grounds, we stopped at the check-in table and got name tags. The 
woman working the table asked my date if she was a Playmate. My date looked 
down at her chest, then back at the woman and quipped, "I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty cool she thought you were a Playmate, though, huh?" I queried on our 
way in. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say that to every woman, silly." 
</P>
<P>
 Tagged, we walked through a rock tunnel festooned with photographs from the 
magazine's four decades, then into the back yard. Emerging from the tunnel we 
were examined by the guests, then given drinks. I tried to remember how Mr. 
Hefner looked in those "Playboy After Dark" shows, the way he looked alert but 
prodigiously casual. I wished I smoked a pipe. 
</P>
<P>
 The mansion itself was built in the late 1920s by Arthur Letts Jr., whose 
father founded the Broadway department store chain. It sits on 5 1/2 acres in 
Holmby Hills. The house is large and, for the neighborhood, unassuming. The 
grounds are beautiful, with gardens and pools, an aviary of exotic birds, a 
large arboretum filled with monkeys, iguanas on the stroll and, most 
spectacular of all, several albino peacocks and hens that roam the green lawns 
and fan their stunning white feathers in the breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 The human zoo was of interest, too. Digby Diehl, the Playboy book critic from 
whom I've been fortunate to get favorable reviews, panned my white dinner 
jacket rather pointedly, noting I was the only male on the grounds -- besides 
the albino peacocks, perhaps -- wearing such a thing. Unaffected, I cornered 
Joyce Carol Oates and demanded to know what she thought of Tyson's chances at 
the crown if he ever gets out of the slammer. She said she thought he'd 
champion again. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Ruth Westheimer bustled about, and I wanted to ask her if she thought of 
Playboy magazine, but Dr. Ruth is small and quick as a lizard and I couldn't 
quite catch her. Kinky Friedman made the rounds, giving out guitar picks. 
Timothy Leary squatted poolside, looking a skosh spaced out. Playmates wandered 
about serenely, but every time I got ready to ask one about, oh, say, the 
weather, my companion's grip became vice-like. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know you were that strong." 
</P>
<P>
 "Only when I have to be. You've got a crush on Joyce Carol Oates, don't you?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes. And she knows a ton about boxing!" 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting at the bar for my third martini, I saw clearly that this was my last 
chance for truly sober consideration of the event. I thought back to the social 
climate in the United States in the early '50s, the dulling strictures of the 
Truman and Eisenhower years that Hugh Hefner blatantly defied with publication 
of his first magazine. I recalled Hefner saying in interviews that he was 
worried that photographs of busty, naked women might not go over too well with 
the American public, which is why he put no date on the cover of his first 
issue: If it didn't sell, he could leave it on the stands another month. 
</P>
<P>
 I also recalled an anecdote from an interview with Mr. Hefner some 20 years 
ago, in which he said that one writer sold him an article for that first issue 
and took his payment in stock, rather than cash. The writer, Hefner had 
claimed, became a millionaire off his first piece for Playboy. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed clear to me that Hugh Hefner had predicted the weather of the '60s 
and '70s more clearly than many had given him credit for. How else to account 
for a Playboy circulation that had hit 26 million monthly by 1974? 
</P>
<P>
 I also couldn't help but note that history is dialectic -- hypothesis leads to 
antithesis, which leads (hopefully) to synthesis -- and that our times are all 
but hostile to the life forms encouraged by Playboy. Permissiveness, 
materialism, personal and sexual liberty of the individual are low on most 
agendas these days, except perhaps for those of homosexual activists. 
Meanwhile, magazines featuring nude women are back in Dad's sock drawer or more 
likely banished from the American household altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 When questioned, many men will tell you they read Playboy for the articles and 
stories, which is not an altogether evasive answer. This is what I tried to 
convey to Mr. Hefner when we finally met -- that I respected him very much for 
publishing such good writers over the years. I thought of Gabriel Garcia 
Marquez and Norman Mailer and Thomas McGuane and James Baldwin and Nadine 
Gordimer and John Irving and many more. If photos of pretty, naked women had 
underwritten such stories, the stories were none the worse for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Hefner smiled and thanked me for thanking him for the stories, and that 
was about it. A while later as we wandered the grounds we spotted his two young 
children out on the tennis court, driving around in a miniature Volkswagen Bug. 
There they were, children in the Playboy Mansion, signs of our odd, 
contradictory, hard-earned and hard-pressed times.

3-HOUR TOUR: AT THE SAN JUAN LOOP TRAIL, IT'S ALWAYS TREK-OR-TREAT TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, Benjamin Epstein is a free-lance writer who contributes 
regularly to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The two-mile San Juan Loop Trail begins and ends mere feet from the Ortega 
Highway, and there's no better introduction to hiking in the Santa Ana 
Mountains' Ortega Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 1:30 to 2: The sign out front promises "candy, fudge, chocolate, cold drinks, 
ice cream," so it's no surprise that the Ortega Oaks General Store is also 
called the Olde Candy Shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been known as the candy store for 30 years," said owner James Foster, 
"just because of the candy. And the same people have been coming here for years 
and years. They make a nice hike for an hour or two, they come by and want a 
cold drink. Some stop in before the trail, some after. Or they'll pick up some 
beef jerky." 
</P>
<P>
 Hikers, in fact, have their pick of 18 kinds of beef jerky in jars, a dozen 
more packaged, and six types of turkey jerky. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just make so many different flavors anymore," Foster said.  
</P>
<P>
 Yardlong jerky "whips" -- Bull Dash Whip and Teriyaki Bull Whip -- at $2.99 
should provide protein enough to keep you moving right along. 
</P>
<P>
 So will Go Go Go Turbo Truffle "gourmet chocolate stimulant," 49 cents and 200 
milligrams of caffeine each: "More energizing than two cups of coffee," boasts 
the wrapper. Oh, yeah, that's how I'd like to feel face to face with a mountain 
lion! Speaking of which, "tiger milk" is sold by the pound. (The swirled white 
and dark chocolate and nut concoction bears no relation to the nutrition bar: 
"I don't know where we got the name," Foster admitted.) 
</P>
<P>
 Since you'll be on the trail, trail mix perhaps makes the best sense. And 
bottled water, of course. Foster also offers film, firewood and flashlights, 
propane, tablecloth clamps and a variety of products with snappy slogans, 
including Potty Toddy Tabs "one tab does it all" holding-tank treatments, and a 
Swat That Fly -- "It'll kill ya!" 
</P>
<P>
 2 to 3:30: The San Juan Loop Trail starts just opposite the store -- having 
its very own parking lot attests to its popularity -- and rises quickly from 
the highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Round a bend and you can hear running water, and a small canyon comes into 
view. An easy side trip down to the intimate waterfalls and pools of San Juan 
Creek is possible at this point. Water spiders flitted across the surface of 
the pools, while tadpoles, like so many spermatozoa on steroids, darted below. 
Bell-like yellow flowers grew out of cracks in rocks mid-creek. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail gets higher as the canyon gets deeper, making for striking views, 
then works back down toward the canyon floor, tantalizingly approaching water 
and pulling back several times before reaching a large, relatively flat and 
blissfully shady rock creek-side, which is perfect for a snack or picnic -- and 
for witnessing the vagaries of nature: Like an Icarus in reverse, a butterfly 
flew too close to the water and couldn't escape the cold current. 
</P>
<P>
 All manner of scat, and the occasional weed out of Dr. Seuss, punctuate the 
trail. On the brushy hillside was an outcrop of rock like a lonely sentinel, a 
lone tree like a lollipop. Hawks soar overhead. But the solitude doesn't last. 
Once past a huge, gnarled oak, and the intersection of the Chiquito Trail, the 
loop often runs disquietingly -- literally -- parallel to the highway. It veers 
sharply left at Upper San Juan Campground and ultimately reaches the parking 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
 3:30 to 4:30: With the San Juan Loop Trail behind you, loop back to San Juan 
-- Capistrano, that is. Crossing over the freeway, the first place you'll come 
to is Cynthia's Tearoom & Bakery, and if you're not too grungy, stop in for 
high tea. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside are beams and fans overhead, hand stenciling on the walls, pine cones 
in the windows and a saintly statuette in an alcove behind the kitchen. Over 
one doorway is handwritten "Take time to be happy." Vivaldi is heard in the 
background. 
</P>
<P>
 Scones are served piping hot in traditional English style with clotted cream, 
jam and butter; $3.50 includes your choice of teas. Quiches, served with fruit, 
are $4.90. Zucchini quiche was a recent special, but to best celebrate your 
foray along California 74, the obvious choice is quiche with Ortega chilies.

CHARACTER SKETCHES; COMPUTER USERS ARE DEVELOPING AN ART FORM ALL THEIR OWN. 
IT'S NOT A NEW PROGRAM. IT'S RIGHT OFF THE KEYBOARD. 
</P>

 Take a colon, a hyphen and an end parenthesis. Like so :-) Now, turn your head 
sideways. See the smiley? Well, that smiley is the most rudimentary image in 
what is arguably the world's fastest-growing art form -- ASCII art. 
</P>
<P>
 The abbreviation (pronounced ASK-ee) stands for American Standard Code for 
Information Interchange and refers to the 26 letters, punctuation marks and 
symbols (such as %, * and 7/8) on any computer keyboard. ASCII artists 
creatively combine these characters to make everything from little smiles and 
stick figures to incredibly textured pictures, logos, calligraphy, maps and 
even animations. 
</P>
<P>
 Pictures made from type may be almost as old as the letterpress, but the 
Internet and electronic-mail explosions have vaulted ASCII imagery into 
millions of homes and offices throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing about ASCII is that it's basically transportable to any type of 
machine," explains Steven Sullivan, a computer programmer from Lowell, Mass., 
and a self-described "Mega-ASCII-Head" who collects ASCII art. "Since they're 
character-based pictures, they can be viewed on any type of terminal. You don't 
have to have any special hardware or software." 
</P>
<P>
 The same goes for printing it out. (Most ASCII-art experts, however, know to 
set their screens and printers for courier type because it's monospaced, 
meaning each character takes up an equal space.) Thus, someone wanting to flirt 
via the Internet can send an ASCII wink without worrying about the intended's 
operating system. Parents E-mail their children hugs. Students show their 
spirit with ASCII university logos. And, should things get ugly, the bird can 
be flipped ASCII-style. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan began collecting the ASCII masterpieces he found on the Internet 
about four years ago. He archives his finds in virtual libraries and publishes 
on-line magazines -- editions, he calls them -- of popular and impressive ASCII 
creations. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's Rod Serling, Spock, Harry Truman, William F. Buckley, you name it," 
Sullivan says. "There's a ton of Christmas stuff, Easter, St. Patrick's Day, 
Valentine's Day. They all come out of the woodwork during a holiday." Such 
perennial faves as birthday cakes, birds, roses and "Star Trek" stuff turn up 
next to the pop culture icons Barney the Dinosaur and Beavis and Butt-head. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of this art, he says, evolved in a practical attempt to broaden 
electronic communicability. "When you're writing something, you can't tell tone 
of voice," Sullivan explains. "So if you post a snide comment, but 
tongue-in-cheek, you put that little smiley next to it" so people don't take it 
the wrong way. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of ASCII imagery, however, is simply the most modern of twists on the old 
human aesthetic impulse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think there's a deep-rooted human need to exploit every new medium 
for making art," says Jorn Barger, a Chicago-based computer consultant and 
ASCII artist. "E-mail is such a desperately impoverished medium that every 
little bit of art seems to satisfy a hunger." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Barger began experimenting with ASCII art four years ago. Then, last year, he 
got serious: "When I was unemployed, I got much more deeply into the Internet." 
</P>
<P>
 His first real accomplishment was a rendering of singer Kate Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I worked on this portrait, I would try a little area and stand back and 
kind of squint and I could see which characters needed improving. I would keep 
changing it until I got something that looked good," Barger says. "It's kind of 
a geeky way of doing art that doesn't require any grace." 
</P>
<P>
 In this trial-and-error manner, he has also crafted textured portraits of 
James Joyce as well as more fanciful images, such as a pair of hands reaching 
for a floating heart. He is now creating an ASCII-graphic novel. 
</P>
<P>
 Barger does not draw or paint off the keyboard, but other ASCII Picassos do 
equally impressive work in other media. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Jittlov -- an L.A.-based independent filmmaker, special-effects creator 
and animator -- sees ASCII art as "one more creative outlet." His full-length, 
three-page-long nude portrait of a woman named Meriday -- done predominantly in 
8s, uppercase Ms and colons -- is said by many to be the most oft-posted piece 
of ASCII art. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I understand, Meriday's portrait is now gracing the inside of 
filing cabinets around the world -- especially IBM offices," Jittlov says. 
"She's just received a small (electronic) avalanche of birthday greetings." 
</P>
<P>
 Early ASCII artworks, Barger says, rarely reached Meriday's dimensions. They 
were used in what is known in 'Net speak as ".sig files." These files, almost 
always four lines high, are appended to E-mail and represent the sender's 
"signature." A lot of creativity goes into them. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's really the finest art to me, to be able to put something that 
expressive in that small an area," Barger says. The Energizer bunny, Bart 
Simpson and a pair of dueling fencers are a few of the notable .sig pieces. 
"People have done amazing things with stick figures lately," Barger adds. 
"Somebody did a whole encyclopedia of Tai-Chi (positions). They did really 
lovely images of a couple dancing, doing swoops and dips." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these .sig file pictures are what ASCII aficionados call line 
drawings. They involve a limited set of characters -- what Barger has dubbed 
the "line-draw palette" -- to render lines and forms. 
</P>
<P>
 The more pyrotechnic ASCII art uses the "ASCII gray scale," which exploits a 
character's light-emitting value (or ink saturation, when printed) -- an 
uppercase M being a very saturated character; a period, a low one -- to create 
the illusion of texture and shading. But it gets even more sophisticated: "You 
also make use of the fact that the small m is filled (with pixels) in the lower 
half, but not in the upper half, while h would have the left and bottom filled 
but the upper right is blank," Barger says. 
</P>
<P>
 Three-dimensional images can be created using various character combinations 
to give the illusion of depth. And, by programming a command that moves 
individual characters or flips screens, some artists have even pulled off ASCII 
animations. 
</P>
<P>
 This new medium began to get serious attention last year. Barger was among 
those spearheading an ASCII-art news group on the Internet that allows users 
worldwide to request, post, trade and download images as well as to give and 
solicit advice or discuss pressing ASCII issues. This cluster of ASCII 
brainpower quickly advanced the art form. Even the simple smiley can now: 
</P>
<P>
 wink ;-) 
</P>
<P>
 wear shades 8-) 
</P>
<P>
 get drunk :*) 
</P>
<P>
 cry :'- ( 
</P>
<P>
 among 40 or so other things. 
</P>
<P>
 Such progress also means that amid the posting, copying and improving of 
artwork, the original ASCII artist often goes uncredited. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a thread (a discussion on the Internet) about attributions and 
people improving other peoples' work," Sullivan says, adding: "There haven't 
been any flame wars (Internet arguments) over it. We're a pretty civil group." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Barger is against credit lines. "It looks silly, the attribution is usually 
wrong, and, anyway, appropriation has always been the name of the game," he 
says. "My feeling is that I like being credited better than uncredited, but I 
also like it better having my work reused than not reused, credited or not." 
</P>
<P>
 The oft-appropriated Jittlov is hardly proprietary either. "It would be nice 
(to get credit)," he says resignedly. "(But) people don't often do that." 
</P>
<P>
 What the ASCII world really needs now, Barger says, is software that would 
make for better ASCII art. "Right now, you're working in a word processor and 
everything is clumsy and slow," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
 Some programs do exist, and they're given away freely via the Internet. 
Figlet, for example, generates ASCII "fonts," allowing the user to create 
calligraphy, block letters or other odd-shaped characters of various types and 
styles. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most revolutionary ASCII program is the creation of Rob Harley, a 
23-year-old doctoral student in computer science at Caltech in Pasadena. "I 
wanted to include my picture in my E-mail messages," he explains. "But I'm not 
a good enough artist to do the whole thing by hand."  
</P>
<P>
 So, rather than use Barger's hunt-and-peck method, Harley wrote a program -- 
one that took him all of one afternoon to complete -- that converts a computer 
image, including drawings and photos input via scanner, into ASCII. The "Mona 
Lisa" Harley created using this "Asc" program is the 'Net's most popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Barger sees these developments as ushering in a new age of ASCII art 
-- in which ASCII graphics, flow charts and other made-from-text visual 
delights will be a regular part of E-mail transmission -- Harley sees the march 
of nanotechnology as the death knell for character-based creativity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason this is so popular now is because people can send text more freely 
than they could send pictures or sounds," Harley says. "I expect that in the 
future, we'll be able to send pictures as easily as we send text today. When 
that happens, ASCII art will be history."

 A woman might get more mileage from a suit or sportswear separates, but a 
dress is feminine and fast . Slip it on, add a few basic accessories -- shoes, 
hose, handbag, earrings -- and out the door you go. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, the woman-dress relationship isn't ideal. But it's not the frequent 
trips to the dry cleaners or the almost zero mix-and-match possibilities that 
send women scurrying to the suit and separates racks. It's the dearth of 
attractive styles for all the historic dress places -- lunch, brunch, dinner, 
work, weddings. 
</P>
<P>
 The dress can be tricky to design and merchandise. It needs to impress 
instantly with what insiders call "hanger appeal," and something as minor as a 
drooping belt can ruin the image and discourage the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
 The task can be so daunting that Los Angeles designer Rosemary Brantley, who 
chairs the Otis College of Art and Design fashion department, says: "Students 
tend to back away from dress design. To give a person a great look with only 
one piece stumps them. It's much easier in separates." 
</P>
<P>
 Caught in a Catch-22, manufacturers have responded to a drop in sales with a 
drop in production -- and higher prices: There were 41 million fewer 
American-made dresses in stores in 1992 than in 1987, but their value increased 
by $377 million, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 The difficulties have actually encouraged some sportswear giants, including 
Jones New York, to jump into the abyss. Two years ago, the 24-year-old firm 
added a dress division aimed at career women willing to spend $160 to $200 for 
a dress, $260 to $300 for a dress and jacket. Danish-born designer Heidi Maria 
Schwarck, 31, was wooed from Tahari to create such "classics with a twist" as 
the $190 coat dress in her spring collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping the Jones consumer and cost limitations in mind, Schwarck starts the 
design process with the selection of colors and fabrics for an entire 
collection. Her spring coat dress, one of at least five styles in the same 
material, was produced in black and fawn. The lighter shade was chosen, 
Schwarck says, because "it's a good transition color. It will look good even if 
you don't have a tan." 
</P>
<P>
 The textured rayon fabric -- with a "silk hand" or "linen hand," depending on 
who's talking at Jones -- is a company staple with a proven track record. So is 
Schwarck's dress. Introduced last fall, it became a bestseller and is back, 
without sleeves, for summer. 
</P>
<P>
 If Schwarck is starting from scratch, she makes a quick sketch. In the case of 
the coat dress, she wanted something "easy, casual, not too serious or 
overdone. I thought of a trench coat. So I started with the back." 
</P>
<P>
 The sketch goes to a pattern maker, who whips up the left half in muslin and 
pops it on a form. 
</P>
<P>
 The two women tinker with the muslin, fine-tuning the pattern before it is 
made into a sample garment. Schwarck chooses the trimmings, which were minimal 
for her coat dress: two clear plastic buttons, a heavy-duty hook and eye, and a 
mahogany-colored, imitation-leather belt with white stitching. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's fit model takes only 15 to 20 minutes in the sample to tell 
Schwarck "things I can't see" -- as well as things she can. She has the model 
sit, cross and uncross her legs to make sure the dress doesn't open or ride up 
too much, stretch her arms to check sleeve movement, and bend forward to see if 
her bra shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The hemline is a given. For the Jones customer, "It has to be at the knee. We 
can't go any higher," says Schwarck, who takes each new design on a trial run 
in the office after hours, leaving notes if she wants changes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Construction details -- the wrap front, separate bodice and skirt, set-in 
sleeves, lapels, trench-coat back -- can be enlarged or reduced to cover 
customers ranging from the company's "ideal" Size 8 to large size and petite. 
The pattern pieces are cut with a minimum of waste; a Size 8 coat dress is 
squeezed from 2.3 yards of 58-inch fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 Because this is "a functional dress," the two flap pockets are usable -- 
perhaps to stash a lipstick, Schwarck suggests. The garment, which is fully 
lined, has a number of extras including ample hem and seams and the back 
design. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones produced 1,350 coat dresses for spring. It took one year and at least 35 
company employees to get them to the consumer, who would decide if the fit, 
fabric, seams and such were worth $190. 
</P>
<P>
 The price could indicate a $45 to $50 cost to the manufacturer, for materials 
and labor, and a $95 wholesale cost to the retailer. But an industry insider, 
who requested anonymity, estimates material and labor costs were $38.50 and the 
net wholesale price $75, which reflects an 8% discount to the retailer. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his calculations, he says the dress is not overpriced. "Not for a 
label like Jones New York. They buy nice fabrics. They do it all from scratch. 
They have an overwhelming staff of craftsmen. If that were a moderately priced 
dress line, they would have knocked off somebody's design, made 90,000 to 
100,000 dresses, used cheaper fabrics and cheaper trims, and the dress might 
retail for $100." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Handford, a veteran Los Angeles designer, sees the numbers differently: 
"The retailer would be lucky if it makes a $10 profit on the dress, and the 
manufacturer nets 6% to 7%." The Jones label, he adds, means the customer can 
expect "good workmanship, good fit and a well-priced garment that's reliable 
but not terribly innovative."  
</P>
<P>
 And that's a compliment. "If you made the same dress in lame with sequin trim, 
the Jones New York customer would bypass it and the stores would have to eat 
them for breakfast," Handford explains. "Stores are looking for certain 
manufacturers who fill certain customer needs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the label, women want a dress that will endure many wearings and 
cleanings. To check for quality, experts suggest scrutinizing the garment while 
it's still on the hanger. Look for an even hemline and sleeves that hang 
straight. Make sure the collar lies flat and the lapels don't pucker. Any 
puckers will get worse with dry cleaning. Check for neat, finished workmanship 
on seams, buttonholes and hem. Crush a bit of fabric in your hand to test for 
wrinkle resistance. And when you try on the dress, sit down to test for ample 
hip room. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwarck says that despite its one-piece construction, her dress can deliver a 
number of looks. A woman could change the neckline with a scarf or a lace 
camisole. She could make the garment dressier with high heels and matte gold 
jewelry, or give it an ethnic flavor with a different belt. And when she's had 
the dress for ages, she could do what one of Schwarck's assistants did: Whack 
it off below the pockets and wear it as a long jacket over leggings. 
</P>
<P>
 For Tina Hagen -- a Los Angeles sportswear designer who includes at least one 
dress in every collection -- that could be asking a lot from a frock. 
</P>
<P>
 Her advice to women on the verge of a purchase is simple: "I think you have to 
look at it in terms of your own lifestyle. It should make you happy. You should 
look pretty in it. You want something you'll enjoy and something that will 
last. But a dress is not a microwave oven." The Dress Deconstructed 
</P>
<P>
 The $190 wrap-front coat dress in a Size 8 by Jones New York takes 2.3 yards 
of 58-inch textured rayon, with a silk or linen "hand," or feel. 1) The set-in 
sleeves and "quality" shoulder pads are designed to hold their own during 
multiple dry cleanings. 2) The notched collar and lapels should be flat; any 
puckers would only get worse. 3) Leather-look belt in mahogany with white 
stitching keeps the wrap closed. Out of sight are two clear plastic buttons and 
a heavy-duty hook and eye. 4) Becasue this is a "functional dress," flap 
pockets are for real and roomy enough to hold a lipstick. 5) A full lining and 
sturdy seams and hems contribute to longevity -- and price.

FIRST PERSON: THE DOC LIVED LIKE HE DIED -- WITH STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Doctor died the other day. He dropped dead during a basketball game on a 
high school court back in New York, where he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 35, way too young to go. But he'd hung with the wrong crowd and spent 
his last years homeless in Venice Beach, eking out an existence under the warm 
Southern California sun. The Doc always hated cold weather. 
</P>
<P>
 His real name was Larry. He was an intelligent, articulate man who one day 
woke up to find himself living outside society in a beat-up old van that held 
his worldly belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 His stepbrother, Eric, my former college roommate, called to tell me about 
Larry's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric is a true cynic. When I said I wanted to write a story about the Doctor, 
he scoffed: "Yeah, right. What's the story? That another Venice Beach homeless 
person bites the dust?" 
</P>
<P>
 No, that's not it. The story is that all those seemingly aimless people we see 
wandering around Venice Beach or Santa Monica or along freeway exit ramps in 
Downtown Los Angeles have real pasts -- even if they've given up temporarily on 
the present. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like the Doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 And like Larry, they have friends and family who still love them, who may have 
fallen out of touch with them, who might be desperately seeking to find them, 
reconcile mistakes and start again. 
</P>
<P>
 They're people with high school yearbook photos, like Larry's -- right there 
among the junior class of Great Neck North Senior High back in 1975. They've 
had Glory Days that deserve recognition, even after their death. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry grew up on the streets of Queens. Then his divorced father, who is 
Haitian, married a woman who lived out on Long Island. So Larry and his sister 
joined their new family -- three kids and a stepmom -- in Great Neck. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brady Bunch it was not. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry shared a room with Eric, who was a year ahead in school. They were like 
night and day. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was from the city; I was from the suburbs," Eric recalled. "I'm Jewish; he 
was Catholic. He was black; I was white. It went on from there." 
</P>
<P>
 But eventually, they began to bond like brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Years before, Larry had spent a few years in a Catholic boarding school. He 
bristled at authority, an attitude that soon rubbed off on Eric. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, they liked to shock people, play on their differences, especially in 
Great Neck -- an upper-middle-class, largely Jewish, bedroom community of New 
York City. Every time the mixed-race family walked into some restaurant, 
eyebrows raised. That's when Eric and the Doctor went to work.  
</P>
<P>
 "People would ask 'How do you two know each other?' " Eric said. "And we'd say 
'We're brothers. Hell, don't we look like one another?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Eric always looked up to the Doctor. He had class. Kids imitated him. He had 
leadership stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 And "the Doctor" nickname suited him. At night, Larry was on the phone for 
hours, counseling high school friends, mostly women, about their love lives and 
futures. People started calling him the Doctor. To Eric, he was just "Doc." 
</P>
<P>
 Eric and Larry called themselves the Soul Patrol. On Eric's 18th birthday, the 
two got drunk at school and ended up getting suspended. It was, as Eric said, 
"one of our defining moments of hilarity." 
</P>
<P>
 But Eric graduated. Larry didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric, never a high school achiever, went to college, got his MBA and a 
high-paying job in Chicago. Larry dropped out, later got his GED and an 
associate arts degree before taking a series of retailing jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here's where the story gets blurry. Larry moved to Los Angeles in the early 
1980s in search of a new definition of cool. He hung out, bounced basketballs 
with the Venice Beach street players. 
</P>
<P>
 He also lost touch with Eric. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, it surprised me last November when Eric called with the news that the 
Doc was down and out. Soft-spoken, winner-with-the-women, way-cool Larry -- 
from whom people always expected big things -- was homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Larry had kept in touch with his mother and sisters, but not 
Eric. He always felt a bit ashamed, it seems, in light of his successful 
stepbrother. But Eric didn't care about Larry's lack of success: He just wanted 
to get back in touch with the Doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 And so Eric dispatched me to find Larry and give him a letter containing 
pictures of Eric's new daughter. I found the Doc last Thanksgiving weekend 
along the Venice Beach boardwalk, keeping watch over parked cars for a few 
extra bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 He looked pleased when I handed him Eric's letter, smiling like someone who 
has suddenly remembered something touching or funny about their past. 
</P>
<P>
 For a moment, we talked about how I first met him back in Great Neck during a 
college vacation. I was a hick from Upstate New York, impressed with the Doctor 
and that sense of style I knew I would never have. 
</P>
<P>
 I gave Larry my number at work, told him I could patch him through to Eric. He 
tried contacting me a few times, always leaving a short message on my machine. 
We never spoke again. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the brothers made contact. When Eric got laid off at Christmas, the Doc 
called with some advice: Just hang in there, things would get better. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months ago, Larry moved back East to rejoin family and friends, and to 
try to set his life straight. Who knew what his plans were? 
</P>
<P>
 One day on a basketball court in Great Neck, he collapsed and died. Unkind 
fate made the Doctor's decision for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Eric is left with the pieces of his stepbrother's troubled life. Who knows 
what happened, where he went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 The past days have been tough for Larry's family, the people he left behind. 
Eric chooses to remember his stepbrother just like always: 
</P>
<P>
 A genuine man who loved his family, one who maybe had a bit of a 
self-destructive streak. 
</P>
<P>
 And crazy to be with. He was, after all, the Doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 At the funeral, Eric asked Larry's friends about his game that day. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me he was hot," he said. "On the day he died, the Doc was smokin'."

LAUGH LINES; SMOKING OUT THE TRUE STORY ABOUT TWINKIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY ZEZIMA, THE STAMFORD ADVOCATE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'd walk a mile for a Twinkie. Well, maybe not that far. But I'd certainly 
walk farther for a Twinkie than I would for a Camel. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two very important reasons for this: 
</P>
<P>
 1. I really like Twinkies. 
</P>
<P>
 2. I don't smoke cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 So it came as quite a surprise to hear that Twinkies were compared to 
cigarettes during congressional hearings on smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 In case you missed it, possibly due to a prolonged sugar rush, here's what 
happened: Tobacco industry people testified, in effect, that cigarettes are no 
more harmful or addictive than Twinkies or other snack foods. Rep. Henry Waxman 
(D-Calif.), who apparently has a sweet tooth, responded: "Twinkies don't kill 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Waxman is, in the medical sense, probably right, I thought I would 
play devil's-food advocate. So, in the interest of fairness -- and having 
nothing better to do -- I called the surgeon general's office in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman who answered the phone was perplexed. So, in accordance with federal 
law, she put me on hold. When she came back on, she told me that Surgeon 
General Joycelyn Elders could not comment about physical effects Twinkies may 
have. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in a genuine effort to either help me or get rid of me, the secretary 
transferred me to Suzanne Gates, a health educator in the Office on Smoking and 
Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates, well aware of the controversy, said that while she doesn't eat 
Twinkies, there is no reason to think they will kill you, unless you happen to 
choke on one. 
</P>
<P>
 "In that case they could be bad for your health," Gates confessed. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in a shocking admission that gives credence to tobacco industry claims, 
Gates said that although Twinkies don't contain tar or nicotine, and are 
"really tough to smoke," they do have something in common with cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who smoke cigarettes usually start at a young age," she said. "So do 
people who develop a taste for Twinkies." 
</P>
<P>
 I found this bit of information so alarming that I called Waxman's office in 
Washington. He wasn't in, but his assistant, Phil Schiliro, made this stunning 
statement: "It's possible Rep. Waxman may have had a Twinkie at one time in his 
life. I can neither confirm nor deny that." 
</P>
<P>
 Schiliro then shamefully admitted he used to eat Twinkies in high school: "The 
combination of advertising and peer pressure really got to me. My younger 
brother was a big Twinkie eater, but he successfully kicked the habit. We 
didn't know at the time that Twinkies were so dangerous. Who knew?" 
</P>
<P>
 Even Keith Schopp, a spokesman for the Continental Baking Co. in St. Louis, 
which makes Twinkies, confessed that he is a "pack a day" Twinkie eater. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the evidence linking Twinkies and cigarettes has been made public -- 
exclusively in this column, I might add -- I propose the following health 
measures: 
</P>
<P>
 * Twinkie warnings. On every pack or box should appear something like: 
"WARNING: The Surgeon General has determined that eating Twinkies may cause you 
to bounce off walls." 
</P>
<P>
 * Twinkie-free buildings. Eating them prohibited on the premises. Doors would 
have symbols with a picture of a Twinkie inside a circle with a red line 
through it. There would also be signs: "Thank you for not eating Twinkies." 
</P>
<P>
 * Twinkie Enders. Programs would be established for people trying to quit 
eating Twinkies. Support groups would also help former eaters and their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 * Twinkie patches. These sponge-cake patches would be attached to the arms of 
Twinkie eaters to medically wean them from their addictions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Twinkie studies. These scientific experiments would study the dangers of 
secondhand cream and why the vegetable shortening in Twinkies is only partially 
hydrogenated. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the tobacco industry should know: When it comes to Twinkies, I'd 
rather fight than quit.

RAY CHARLES: HE'S A GENIUS AT DOING WHAT'S NATURAL; POP MUSIC: 'ANYTHING YOU 
SEE ME DO ON STAGE IS THE WAY I AM OFF,' SAYS THE PLAIN-TALKING SINGER, WHO 
PLAYS COSTA MESA TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A conversation with Ray Charles, even a phone conversation, is much like one 
of his performances: full of dynamic swings, foot-stomping conviction and 
polite interludes. "I'm very natural, man," he said this week from his 
recording studio in Los Angeles. "Anything you see me do on stage is the way I 
am off. I don't put on airs, I don't make believe, I don't see any reason to 
pretend. My mom used to preach 'be yourself,' and there's something to be said 
for that. It's like that old line: 'What you see is what you get.' " 
</P>
<P>
 What you get is a man who's modest about his achievements, determined in his 
love of music and outspoken about what music should be. Ask what he thinks of 
rap and hip-hop and he answers politely -- at first. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to remember I'm a musician," said the singer-keyboardist who back in 
the '50s did as much as anyone to pry open the body of American pop and inject 
it with soul. "So rap doesn't do anything for me; I can't learn anything from 
it. Rap is like reciting poetry -- I could do that when I was 7. All you have 
to do is match (the words) with the rhythm. That's nothing. That's . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 And the depth of his feeling shows with an expletive, for which he apologizes 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 But ask if there isn't some hip-hop rhythm and style on his last record for 
Warner Bros., "My World," and off he goes again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what you mean by hip-hop. How would I know what I'm listening to 
is hip-hop if I don't even know what hip-hop is? In the '70s, they used to ask 
me what disco was and I'd say it's basically a drummer playing quarter notes. 
For a musician, that's nothing new, that's not saying anything. We're always 
keeping time, always playing rhythm. Now country or hillbilly or jazz, they 
have a distinct sound. But hip-hop, I don't know what you mean. It's just 
words, man." 
</P>
<P>
 Which might be just the sort of response you would expect from a performer who 
has spent so much of his career tearing down the barriers between various 
styles, and fusing them back together in his own image. Categories meant 
nothing as Charles started out in the '50s turning gospel tunes into R&B hits 
("Talkin' About You" springs from "Talkin' About Jesus"), melding jazz and pop 
(his 1957 album "The Great Ray Charles") and then, in the '60s, giving 
country-Western a soulful touch with his chart-topping single "I Can't Stop 
Loving You." 
</P>
<P>
 A champion of musical integration, Charles also has taken his music to 
audiences and venues formerly closed to pop musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 As his audience grew, "the Genius" progressed from roadhouses and jazz joints 
to concert halls. That sort of groundbreaking continues tonight when he will 
appear at the Orange County Performing Arts Center -- not as a guest as he did 
a while back with the Pacific Symphony, but with his own orchestra and backup 
singers, the Raelettes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This will be only the second time in the center's nearly eight-year history 
that it has given its stage over to a bona fide pop performer of the post-World 
War II generation (the first having been Art Garfunkel, whose shows are 
decidedly more reserved than Brother Ray's). 
</P>
<P>
 Charles said he has no hard feelings that it has taken certain Orange County 
arts mavens so long to acknowledge his work as sufficiently legit for their 
hall. For one thing, he noted, he has been playing similar venues everywhere 
else in the world for years. 
</P>
<P>
 But beyond that, "you can't really get far into the politics of this kind of 
stuff," he said. "I know times change, just like the services in church have 
changed over the years, and people change. There was a time where they wouldn't 
think of having a jazz thing (in a hall like OCPAC) or when classical musicians 
thought it beneath them to play with a jazz artist. It's a stupid, idiotic 
thing, but I've seen it. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I've found over the years is that you try to please the public, not the 
institutions. If you play good music, they'll come, they'll spend $30 or $40 
and stand in the rain to see you. That's where my love is, that's where my 
heart goes, strictly to the public. When you have people who've stood by you 
for 50 years as I have, that's the only way you can feel." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles is also outspoken over the changes he has seen in the music business 
during those 50 years. "Back when I started, you had music people running the 
record business, people who could tap their feet and snap their fingers in 
time. Today it's all attorneys and lawyers. These guys can't even keep time to 
a march. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back in the days I started with Atlantic (Records), they said, 'You play the 
music, we'll pay the bills.' Now you have a bunch of people who come in and 
tell the artist what to sing and how to sing it. They want the artist to sound 
like the guy who had the last hit record. Everybody ends up copying everybody 
else. It's a shame that the young artist can't be himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings him full circle: Being himself is what Ray Charles is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been fortunate that I was able to be with record companies that did not 
stifle me, did not curtail what I wanted to do. I love all types of music, love 
the blues, the church music, country music. I do what I feel is right for 
myself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a specialist. If you have a jazz concert, I can fit in; if it's 
country, I can fit in. I can sing blues, jazz, a love song. I'm a utility 
player: I can play first, second or third base. I can catch and even pitch if 
you need me to."

 For the last several years, he has been pitching for Pepsi, in a series of 
commercial spots that have placed the phrases "Uh-huh" and "You've got the 
right one, baby" into the national lexicon. Though his reputation is secure 
with adults who were there when he was cranking out hit after hit, does he ever 
worry that a younger generation will remember him only as a soda pop spokesman? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any hang-ups about that," he replied. "I just want people to 
remember me. How they remember me, I don't give a good damn about that; as long 
as I left a mark, that's good enough for me." 
</P>
<P>
 At 63, he said he isn't even considering retirement. "What would I retire to? 
You either retire to something or retire to nothing. Retiring to nothing is a 
waste. This is all that I do, sing and play music, and I'll be doing it until 
the good Lord says, 'You've been a good horse, now its time to put you out to 
pasture.' That's when I'll retire."

TRINITY BROADCASTING PLANS ENTERTAINMENT COMPLEX IN TENNESSEE; MINISTRY: THE 
TUSTIN-BASED NETWORK, WHICH WILL BUY TWITTY CITY, SAYS THE 30-ACRE GOSPEL AND 
COUNTRY MUSIC FACILITY WILL COST $13 MILLION TO CREATE. 
</P>

<P>
 Departing from the conservative fiscal strategy that made it the world's 
largest religious television programming service, Trinity Broadcasting Network 
has announced plans to create a 30-acre, $13-million gospel and country music 
entertainment complex outside Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Crouch, founder and president of the Tustin-based network, says Trinity 
will purchase Twitty City, owned by the family of the late country singer 
Conway Twitty. In March, Trinity purchased an adjoining attraction, Music 
Village, USA, which has been renamed Trinity Music City, USA. 
</P>
<P>
 Trinity, which is tax-exempt and nonprofit, provides 24-hour-a-day Christian 
programming to nearly 400 television and radio stations. Together with his 
wife, Jan, Paul Crouch hosts a nightly Christian talk and variety show called 
"Praise the Lord," being broadcast this week from Tennessee to inaugurate the 
new complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jan and I are very excited about this opportunity to expand our production 
facilities at this location," Crouch said in a prepared statement. Trinity's 
plans include its own recording studio and label. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Pat Boone's Gospel America' weekly television show will be produced here, 
and we will incorporate the entire complex in the production of the show," 
Crouch's statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plans are also underway for a country-gospel music awards show to be 
broadcast from the site, and consideration is being given to utilizing a part 
of Twitty City to house a country-gospel hall of fame," Crouch said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trinity Broadcasting Network is an ideal buyer for the . . . property, as it 
already owns the adjacent land, Music Village, USA," said Hugh Carden, 
president of Conway Twitty Enterprises and co-executor of Twitty's estate. "The 
properties complement each other, and it is fitting the purchase was made by 
another entertainment entity. Their respect for country music has been evident 
during the negotiation process." 
</P>
<P>
 Music Village, USA, which occupies 21 acres adjoining Twitty City in 
Hendersonville, Tenn., is a country-music performance center that also houses 
shops and museums featuring various stars. Trinity paid $10 million for Music 
City, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Trinity's offer for Twitty City, which has been mired in litigation since 
Twitty died a year ago, is $2.75 million, according to probate court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Crouch's Washington, D.C., attorney, Colby M. May, said in an interview that 
both the Music City and Twitty City purchases "are straight cash transactions." 
</P>
<P>
 Twitty City includes the homes of Conway Twitty, his 81-year-old mother and 
his four children, as well as a theater, gift shop, landscaped grounds and 
gardens. The family members will be required to leave their homes on the 
grounds, according to terms of purchase agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many other major religious broadcasters in the 1980s and '90s, Trinity 
survived and prospered by avoiding such high-overhead financial drains as large 
churches, colleges and theme-park resorts. Crouch frequently boasted to viewers 
that the network, with an estimated market value of $500 million, never 
borrowed money to buy stations and eschewed high salaries and production 
frills. 
</P>
<P>
 According to documents filed with the Internal Revenue Service, Trinity listed 
net assets of just under $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 May, Crouch's attorney, said that Trinity envisions the new complex as a 
"vehicle" and a "platform" for using gospel music to "expand the ministry by 
providing that kind of inspiration to a wider and wider segment of our 
supporter and viewers. . . . The two facilities are fairly large (efforts) in 
taking this first step." 
</P>
<P>
 While May said the complex probably will be the site for large-scale crusades 
and other outreach events, he cautioned against making too much of the move. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not talking about a Christian theme park," he said. "This is not going 
to be an overnight Hollywood East with big overhead." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, commercials last week on Trinity stations began advertising 
"Gospel Fanfare" on the grounds of "Trinity Music City" last weekend, inviting 
people to meet country singer Charlie Daniels, along with the network's own 
entertainers. 
</P>
<P>
 That event preceded the annual country "Fanfare," which is taking place all 
week in Nashville and is sponsored by the Country Music Assn., a convention 
where fans of recording stars line up to meet their favorite performers. 
</P>
<P>
 Trinity's move into the music industry may represent a risk. In 1990, Trinity 
announced an ambitious plan to make inspirational movies and established its 
own film division, Trinity Films, to produce them. Its first effort, "China 
Cry," was well-received, but according to documents filed with the IRS, Trinity 
Films still owes more than $8 million to Trinity Broadcasting Network.  
</P>
<P>
 Trinity and associated organizations controlled or financed by the network or 
other Crouch family members own more than a dozen television stations in the 
United States. In addition to flagship KTBN Channel 40 in Orange County, 
Trinity owns outlets in Miami, Dallas and Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Trinity has an affiliated station in the area of the new complex, which will 
move its production studios from Gallatin, Tenn., the network said, into a 
structure that is a replica of Thomas Jefferson's Monticello. 
</P>
<P>
 That station, WPGD, is controlled by Jay Sekulow, a high-profile attorney 
known for successfully arguing landmark cases on behalf of evangelicals before 
the U.S. Supreme Court. Sekulow also has his own show on Trinity. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Trinity's liabilities listed with the IRS in 1992, the last year for 
which figures are available, was an unsecured loan of $1.5 million to Sekulow's 
broadcasting company, Sonlight. 
</P>
<P>
 According to its April, 1994, newsletter, Trinity has 390 owned and affiliated 
radio and television stations around the world, "now reaching a potential 
viewing audience of 70 million in America." 
</P>
<P>
 In the same newsletter, Crouch wrote that, in addition to these over-the-air 
outlets, "Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS) and the Information Superhighway are 
coming. The day is fast approaching when we will literally have access to 
virtually every soul on Planet Earth!"

REGION; PASADENA; GLEN RESIDENTS ARE UNDAUNTED DESPITE DISASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SULLIVAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During 27 years of disasters, Stevan Young has been dragged through the mud. 
</P>
<P>
 Literally. 
</P>
<P>
 The 36-year-old Pasadena Glen resident lost his home -- as well as the house 
he grew up in -- to last year's fires. Plus, he's been through three major 
mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
 People in safer neighborhoods look at the disasters that historically befall 
the Glen and say, "What kind of person would live in a place like that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Stevan Young is the ultimate answer. Disasters of epic magnitude are a 
trade-off for living in what Young calls a sanctuary from the urban jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 "You love it for what it is," he said. "You take what it throws back at you, 
but you love it for what it is."  
</P>
<P>
 Born in Pasadena, Young moved to the Glen in 1967 with his parents and 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1969, an almost biblical rain pounded the Glen for a week straight. When 
the water burst loose, Young said, "we could hear the rumbling, and we could 
see cars rolling down like surfboards." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, another flood hit, on Feb. 14. Young was returning from a party at 2 
a.m. Noting signs of trouble, he rushed up the road to warn his family and 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 He reached them in time, but as he turned to leave, the crashing mud overtook 
him, flipping his truck and throwing him out the back window. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors fished Young out as he neared the bottom of the canyon. His clothes, 
except for a belt and belt loops, had been ripped entirely off. The skin was 
torn off his knees, his teeth were chipped, and his head was gashed. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Altadena firestorm struck before dawn on Oct. 27, Young rushed from 
his own place in the middle of the Glen to fight the fire, which was 
threatening his parents' house at the top of the canyon -- the home he grew up 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 When the flames ignited the house next door, Young decided it was time to 
escape. But when he sprinted down the road to his own home, he found the pines 
next door ablaze. The fire had eaten so much oxygen from the air that his truck 
would barely start. 
</P>
<P>
 His parents' house burned to the ground, as did Young's own. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in February, the Glen was struck yet again, this time by floods that 
raged down the fire-denuded canyon.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, like many of his neighbors, Young plans to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you going to do, find someplace better?" Young asked. "Well, there 
is no place better. This is the best there is."

TIDBITS: GLEN TAVERN PLANS REOPENING AS A SANTA PAULA STEAKHOUSE.

 It's been two years since Santa Paula's Glen Tavern Restaurant (at the Glen 
Tavern Inn) has been open to the public. But that's about to change. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Sunsgshil Kang said folks can expect the place to be back in business 
in a month or so. In its latest incarnation, said Kang, the Glen Tavern will be 
a traditional American steakhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 As for staff, Kang said he is conducting interviews for just about every 
position.

 Which came first, the chicken or the Eggs 'N' Things? 
</P>
<P>
 For longtime residents of Ventura County, that might seem like a pretty close 
call. The Eggs 'N' Things chain has been around for about 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 It all began with the Camarillo restaurant -- which was followed by others in 
Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley and Ventura. And as of this week, there will be a 
new addition to the family, this one in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to do a lot of banquets, catering and large parties," said Debbie 
McClintock, general manager of Eggs 'N' Things. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ojai Eggs 'N' Things is located at 1103 Maricopa Highway. 
</P>

<P>
 Chef Neal Rosenthal, owner Mario Comandatore and the other powers that be have 
finalized the menu for the new Mario's Bistro, scheduled to open next week at 
the Shopping at the Rose center in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 For lunch, there will plenty of salads including a double bruscetta, one 
topped with tomatoes, basil and garlic, the other with sauted eggplant and 
gorgonzola cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 As for sandwiches, look for house-cured salmon served with herbed mascarpone 
and the Rosenthal version of the BLT, with pancetta, fresh tomatoesand romaine. 
</P>
<P>
 The dinner menu will feature tenderized beef, rolled and stuffed with 
tomatoes, olives, mushrooms and herbs, braised in Chianti and served on 
spinach-laced garlic mashed potatoes.

FINALISTS SET FOR HEATED SUPERVISORIAL RACES; RESULTS: FRANK SCHILLO FACES 
TRUDI LOH OVER ISSUES OF ENVIRONMENT AND EXPERIENCE. JUDY MIKELS AND SCOTT 
MONTGOMERY SQUARE OFF OVER THEIR SERVICE RECORDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Taking barely a moment to celebrate their primary election victories, the four 
finalists for two seats on the Ventura County Board of Supervisors were already 
gearing up Wednesday for a November runoff that promises much harder-hitting 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo will square off against 
first-time candidate Trudi Loh in a race that is expected to be dominated by 
growth issues. And Moorpark Councilman Scott Montgomery will battle Simi Valley 
Councilwoman Judy Mikels in a separate supervisorial showdown that will focus 
largely on their public records. 
</P>
<P>
 The stage has also been set for several competitive legislative and 
congressional contests in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The race in the 24th Congressional District, which includes Thousand Oaks, 
will match a former top aide to Gov. Pete Wilson against an 18-year Democratic 
incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the 35th state Assembly District, which includes portions of western 
Ventura County, a college professor who once lived on food stamps will square 
off against a wealthy Santa Barbara winery owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Voter turnout in Ventura County was at its lowest in recent memory in 
Tuesday's gubernatorial primary, with less than 35% of the county's 339,356 
voters casting ballots. Election officials cited voter apathy and a lack of 
compelling ballot initiatives for the low turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Bradley, the county's chief election official, said about 8,000 of an 
estimated 24,000 absentee ballots have yet to be counted. He said he expects to 
have all of the ballots counted by next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Appointed Auditor-Controller Thomas O. Mahon, who failed to capture more than 
50% of the vote in Tuesday's election, will have to wait for the final tallies 
to find out who he will face in a November runoff. Ventura accountants Scott 
Weiss and Richard Morrisset were running neck-and-neck for the second-place 
position, with Weiss holding a slim 75-vote lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley said the remaining ballots will decide several Ventura County 
Republican Central Committee elections, which pit a number of Christian 
conservatives against more moderate Republicans who dominate the local party's 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 In other county races, Assistant Dist. Atty. Colleen Toy White will be the 
county's newest Superior Court judge after coasting to an easy victory over 
defense attorney James M. Farley. However, unless Gov. Wilson decides to 
appoint her early to fill the vacant seat, White will have to wait until 
January to take her place on the bench, court officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 County Clerk Richard Dean, Tax Assessor Glenn E. Gray and Supt. of Schools 
Charles Weis each held on to their respective jobs in Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Larry Carpenter, Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury and Tax Collector 
Harold Pittman were automatically returned to office because they faced no 
formal opposition. However, more than 1,400 voters in each race cast protest 
ballots for write-in candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a closer look at the local, state and federal races Ventura County 
voters will face in November. County Supervisors 
</P>
<P>
 In the 2nd District, which covers Thousand Oaks and Port Hueneme, Schillo will 
face Loh in a campaign that is expected to focus on issues ranging from growth 
to waste management. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Schillo strongly backs a proposal to develop a new west county 
landfill, while Loh prefers to explore other alternatives for disposing of 
trash, such as shipping it elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates said they expect a tough race in November, one that will also 
focus more on their qualifications for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo, who has served on the Thousand Oaks City Council for 10 years, said 
he will emphasize his experience and accomplishments. "In government you need 
experience to know how to get things done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Loh, an attorney, hopes to turn her lack of government experience into an 
asset. "I think people want change," she said. "They're not happy with what's 
been going on. They want someone with a new perspective and new ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo collected 32.8% of the vote, while Loh received 23.9%, according to 
semi-final results from Tuesday's election. Former Ventura County Supervisor 
Madge Schaefer, who was hoping to recapture her old seat, came in third with 
20.7% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Loh said she was not discouraged by Schillo's wide margin of votes, saying, 
"I've been at this 10 weeks, he's been at it 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 4th District, which covers Moorpark and Simi Valley, Montgomery will go 
head-to-head in November against Mikels in what promises to be a hard-fought 
race. The two have already expressed differing views on several issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery supports the establishment of a pilot program to offer paramedic 
training to county firefighters. But he has expressed strong reservations about 
a proposed commercial airport at Point Mugu, which he fears could spur 
development of farmland in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels said she does not believe the county can afford at this time to convert 
county firefighters into a paramedic force. Mikels is a strong advocate of 
establishing a commercial airstrip at Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 The two candidates said they also plan to emphasize their experience serving 
on a number of city and county committees, dealing with everything from waste 
management to regional government. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sitting on committees long before Judy was elected," said Montgomery, 
who notes that he has served as a council member for six years compared to 
Mikel's three. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mikels said Montgomery's government experience could not easily be 
compared to her own, since Moorpark is four times smaller than Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moorpark doesn't even have an emergency operations center," Mikels said. 
"After the earthquake, officials had to meet at the mayor's house." 
Congressional District 23 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) will face Democrat Kevin Ready, a Santa 
Barbara County deputy counsel, in the district that covers all of Ventura 
County except most of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly, seeking a fifth term, has already amassed $133,073 for the fall 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Ready, with virtually no name recognition, failed to raise more than $5,000 in 
the primary. However, he said before the primary that once he secured the 
Democratic nomination, it would be easier to raise the money needed to mount a 
credible campaign against an entrenched incumbent such as Gallegly. 
Congressional District 24 
</P>
<P>
 In what promises to be one of the most visible congressional races this fall, 
Republican Richard Sybert, Gov. Wilson's former director of planning and 
research, will go up against Rep. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), an 
18-year veteran of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 In a glimpse of what is expected to be a political brawl in November, Sybert 
on Wednesday immediately came out swinging at Beilenson, saying the congressman 
was too liberal to represent the district that stretches from Thousand Oaks to 
Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's soft on crime, weak on defense and tough on taxpayers," said Sybert, who 
challenged Beilenson to a series of debates. 
</P>
<P>
 But Beilenson's top political adviser quickly rose to the challenge, 
predicting the incumbent would welcome debates and attacking Sybert as a rank 
newcomer to the 24th Congressional District -- thus repeating a charge Sybert's 
fellow Republicans continuously made. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sybert has only recently moved into the district and the only reason he won 
(the GOP primary) is that he invested a tremendous amount of his personal 
wealth into the election," said consultant Craig Miller. "He's a manufactured 
candidate." State Senate District 18 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) will be matched against former San 
Luis Obispo Supervisor Steve MacElvaine for an open seat in the 18th state 
Senate District that includes the cities of Ventura, Santa Paula and Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 MacElvaine has said that he believes O'Connell is vulnerable because 1990 
reapportionment shoved the senate district into conservative San Luis Obispo 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 But O'Connell, who enjoyed strong bipartisan support in his 35th Assembly 
District, has been walking precincts since last July and has already amassed 
more than $300,000 for the fall campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to stick to the script," he said. "I'm going to run on my 
record." Assembly District 38 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Paula Boland (R-Granada Hills) will face Josh Arce, a 
19-year-old political novice, in the 38th Assembly District that includes Simi 
Valley and Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Arce has little name recognition or financial support, he said he 
believes he can run a credible grass-roots campaign against Boland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have ties to any lobbying groups, which have taken over the 
decision-making process," said Arce, a Spanish major at UCLA. "I'm going to go 
in as a 19-year-old who is willing to work with both parties to come up with 
solutions to problems." Assembly District 37 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Nao Takasugi (R-Oxnard), who is seeking his second term, will face 
his old nemesis, former Oxnard City Councilwoman Dorothy Maron, in the district 
that covers most of Thousand Oaks, Moorpark, Port Hueneme and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Maron has already attacked Takasugi for doing little to curb crime and 
joblessness. Takasugi, however, has said that he helped reform workers' 
compensation laws and was instrumental in getting last year's state budget out 
on time, something that had not occurred in seven years. Assembly District 35 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara winery owner Brooks Firestone will square off against Mindy 
Lorenz, a former Green Party congressional candidate, in the 35th District, 
which includes Ventura, Santa Paula, Ojai and most of Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone is expected to focus attention on Lorenz's past affiliation with the 
Green Party. Lorenz, on the other hand, said she will stress her real-life 
experience as a single mother who lived on food stamps before she earned a job 
as a college professor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm someone who understands the concerns of working families," she said.

1994 PREP BASEBALL / LOS ANGELES TIMES ALL-STARS; BOLLING, JENKINS MAKE IT A 
1-2 SWEEP FOR WEST TORRANCE 
</P>

<P>
 The expectations of West Torrance High baseball Coach Harry Jenkins were 
cautiously modest before the 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the Warriors returned two of the area's best players in infielder Derek 
Nicholson, The Times' 1993 South Bay Player of the Year, and Jimmy Yates, an 
all-star outfielder. But after that, it was a team dominated by underclassmen 
and varsity newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest, considering how inexperienced we were on the mound and behind 
the plate, I would have been pretty satisfied with a winning season and a 
playoff spot," Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 But West's apparent weakness at pitcher and catcher turned into strengths. 
Juniors Kirk Bolling and David Delgado, neither of whom had ever pitched on the 
varsity level, combined to win 19 games, and freshman Tony Cosentino, who 
became catcher by default, batted .440 and drove in 27 runs. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergence of those players, combined with the leadership of Nicholson and 
Yates, added up to a lot more than Jenkins envisioned. West posted a 25-7 
record, tied senior-dominated El Segundo for the Pioneer League title and 
reached the Southern Section Division III final. La Quinta beat the Warriors, 
3-1, in the championship game Saturday night at Cal State Fullerton when center 
fielder Anibal Delacruz made a running catch on Nicholson's deep drive to 
center with the bases loaded and two outs in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
 For their efforts, Bolling -- whose production as a hitter and pitcher was 
unmatched in the area -- and Jenkins have been chosen The Times' South Bay 
Player and Coach of the Year, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolling, West's quarterback in football, quickly developed into one of the 
area's top pitchers. The 6-foot-3, 180-pound right-hander was 10-3 with a 2.09 
earned-run average, 83 strikeouts and 31 walks in 77 innings. He played third 
base when he wasn't pitching and led South Bay players with 50 hits, batting 
.454. He hit seven home runs, including two in the playoffs, and had 37 runs 
batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only other guy I had who could pitch and hit like that was (Scott) 
Davison," said Jenkins, referring to the former Redondo standout. "He's going 
to be quite a prospect next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Bolling was named Pioneer League most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the improvement of younger players, Jenkins said this was perhaps 
the most rewarding of his 23 seasons as coach. West started only two seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a really satisfying group," said Jenkins, whose career record stands 
at 419-217-5 after 19 seasons at Redondo (1970-88) and four at West Torrance. 
"They were fun to coach." 
</P>
<P>
 With most of his players returning, Jenkins could be in for more fun in 1995. 
He reached a division final for the first time this season. Next year's goal 
will be one better. Profiles of other all-stars 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Albin, Redondo -- One of the South Bay's winningest pitchers, Albin had 
a three-year varsity record of 23-4. He was 11-1 with two saves this season, 
his only loss coming against Gahr in the Division II quarterfinals. The 
right-hander was selected Ocean League Most Valuable Player after a 5-0 league 
season, and he was the winning pitcher in both of Redondo's playoff victories. 
Albin had a 2.31 earned-run average, 97 strikeouts and 34 walks in 87 2/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Bowles, Peninsula -- A unanimous choice as Bay League Most Valuable 
Player, Bowles (8-3) led the area with a 1.13 ERA and had 96 strikeouts in 68 
innings pitched. He walked only 16. The 6-5, 205-pound right-hander was nearly 
untouchable in league play, posting a 5-0 record that included a no-hitter 
against Hawthorne. Overall, opponents batted .172 against him. Bowles signed 
with Long Beach State. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Sloan, San Pedro -- The latest in a long line of outstanding catchers at 
San Pedro, Sloan played sound defense and ignited many rallies with his power 
hitting in the cleanup spot. The 6-foot, 210-pounder led the Pirates with six 
home runs and eight doubles, batting .405 with 26 runs batted in. He was named 
to the Pacific League first team. Sloan played linebacker on San Pedro's 1993 
City Section 3-A Division champion football team. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Poor, El Segundo -- Named Most Outstanding Player in the Pioneer League, 
Poor emerged as one of the South Bay's most feared hitters. The 6-5, 220-pound 
first baseman led the area with a .521 average (49 for 94), 11 doubles, 12 home 
runs and 45 RBIs. "I don't know if I've ever seen a kid improve as much from 
one year to the next," said El Segundo Coach John Stevenson, who completed his 
35th season. Poor's brother, Jeff, is a standout catcher at Harbor College. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan Ensberg, Redondo -- After earning all-star honors in basketball, 
Ensberg made a smooth transition to baseball. "I think he was Redondo's best 
player," Peninsula Coach Garry Poe said. Not only was Ensberg a defensive 
stalwart at shortstop, but he had a fine offensive season. He batted .457 with 
10 doubles, three home runs and 28 RBIs, despite the fact that teams seemed to 
pitch around him. He walked 35 times in 29 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Marco Estrada, El Segundo -- The backbone of El Segundo's infield, Estrada 
played nearly flawless shortstop, committing only six errors in 30 games. He 
had the least amount of errors among the team's infielders despite handling the 
most chances. Estrada also was efficient at the plate, batting .396 with eight 
doubles, three triples and 10 stolen bases. He struck out only six times in 110 
plate appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Derek Nicholson, West Torrance -- Despite battling injuries, Nicholson again 
showed why many consider him one of the area's best hitters, if not the best. 
He had more than 30 hits for the third consecutive season, batting .462 (36 for 
78) with six home runs and 30 RBIs. "Everything he hit, he hit hard," said El 
Segundo's Stevenson, whose team lost twice to West. Nicholson had 120 hits in 
three varsity seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Rawson, Redondo -- For sheer power, few players in the area could match 
the 6-3, 240-pound Rawson. He hit 11 home runs, and 18 of his 31 hits were for 
extra bases. "He's the best player I've coached in my six years here," Coach 
Tim Ammentorp said. The third baseman hit .364 with 36 RBIs and showed 
deceptive speed by stealing nine bases. As the closer, Rawson was 3-0 with five 
saves and a 1.64 ERA. He was named Most Outstanding Player in the Ocean League. 
</P>
<P>
 Daks Blanks, Carson -- A two-time all-Pacific League choice, Blanks was the 
"quiet catalyst" behind the Colts winning a second consecutive league title, 
according to Coach Mike Kline. The right fielder batted .340 in the leadoff 
spot with five triples and a team-leading 25 stolen bases. Blanks, who played 
defensive back on Carson's City Section 4-A champion team last season, has a 
football scholarship to Northern Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Yates, West Torrance -- A three-sport standout, Yates put together a 
baseball season that topped his all-Southern Section efforts in football and 
soccer. The junior center fielder batted .500 (41 for 82) with 41 runs scored, 
seven home runs, 41 RBIs and 13 stolen bases. His on-base percentage was .640. 
Yates came back to help West reach the Division III final after breaking two 
fingers on his right hand before the start of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Weeks, South Torrance -- Although he played for a losing team, Weeks 
distinguished himself as an all-around player. "He can run, hit, hit for power 
and he has a cannon arm," South Torrance Coach Scott Spector said. West Coach 
Harry Jenkins ranks Weeks among the area's top five players. Without much 
support, the pitcher-shortstop had to carry the load for South. He batted .377 
with 17 RBIs and was 4-2 as a pitcher. All Star Team

1994 PREP BASEBALL / LOS ANGELES TIMES ALL-STARS; SPEEDY ST. BERNARD HIGH 
OUTFIELDER IS BEST IN HIS FIELD 
</P>

<P>
 St. Bernard's best sprinter may have been a baseball player. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Vikings' leadoff hitter, Dana Harrison set the tempo with his speed and 
ability to reach base. He has been clocked running to first base in 3.8 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he didn't get on base when he first got up, he would get on the next two 
or three times," St. Bernard Coach Bob Yarnall said. "He would wreck havoc on 
the bases. No one could throw him out." 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy for a coach to pump up his players, but what about St. Bernard's 
opponents? 
</P>
<P>
 "I never threw him out," Beverly Hills catcher Jeremy Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
 The right-handed-hitting Harrison was a reason the Vikings went from 1-13 in 
1993 to 14-11 in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been fun playing with the team," said Harrison, who signed with Long 
Beach State. 
</P>
<P>
 For his efforts, Harrison has been selected The Times' 1994 Westside Player of 
the Year. 
</P>
<P>
 In his second season as coach, Jon Beckerman of University takes his job so 
seriously that he became a target for gamesmanship from the dean of coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember leaving a nasty message on Jon's answering machine that he didn't 
turn his contract in on time for the Westside tournament," former Crossroads 
Coach Chuck Ice said. "He took everything I said seriously and I was kidding 
half the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Beckerman, 26, took his shots off the field, he finished one up on 
elder statesman Ron Kasparian of Westchester to win his second Western League 
title. The Warriors (19-8-1, 14-3 in the Coastal Conference) won their last 
four games to win the league title. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winning the Western League title was a big accomplishment," Beckerman said. 
"It's been difficult coaching because at times I don't feel mature enough to 
handle some of the tasks." 
</P>
<P>
 For his efforts, Beckerman was selected The Times' Westside Coach of the Year. 
All-star profiles

<P>
 Damon Williams, Culver City -- One of the area's top two-sport athletes,

.420 with 17 RBIs, 19 runs and eight stolen bases. He was selected to the Ocean 
League first team; football recruiters and major league scouts will be watching
