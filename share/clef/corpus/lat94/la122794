 GIVING SHELTER: The number of people looking for a hot meal and a warm place 
to sleep at Oxnard's emergency warming shelter has surged in the wake of an 
early cold snap. . . . Since the center opened on Nov. 21, "we are breaking 
records we aren't anxious to see broken," said Executive Director Brian Bolton. 
. . . The shelter opens its doors when temperatures drop below 40 degrees on 
cloudless days, and below 50 when the chance of rain is at least 50%. The 
shelter will be in operation through March 15, and workers expect to help a 
record number of people.

 LIGHTS OUT: They twinkle at passersby, adding a festive air to the season. . . 
. But those fanciful Christmas lights can lead to a big shock when the January 
electric bill arrives. To save energy, utility companies warned customers to 
keep ostentation to a minimum and turn off lights before midnight or 1 a.m. 
"There are not a lot of folks out viewing them in the evening anyway," said 
Edison spokesman Mike Montoya. 
</P>
<P>
 BODY COUNT: The random violence that characterized an increasing number of 
murder cases nationwide in 1994 was mirrored in Ventura County: More victims 
died at the hands of strangers (B1). . . . Gang-related crime was partly to 
blame, authorities said. While some of the county's murders were solved 
quickly, others are under investigation or remain complete mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
 QUIET, PLEASE: If you're thinking of ringing in the New Year with a noisy 
celebration, you might first take a few minutes for quiet reflection. . . . A 
good place to do that is Camarillo's Positive Learning Center, which is hosting 
a service featuring meditation and music starting at 3 a.m. on Dec. 31 at 221 
Daily Drive. The pre-dawn timing coincides with noon Greenwich time. "At that 
exact time, people all over the world will be (meditating)," said musician 
Kevin Parcher, who will perform at the Camarillo ceremony. Leave your 
noisemakers at home.

BOOK REVIEW; A SEARCH FOR SELF WRAPPED IN MOVING WORDS AND SUFFERING; A KEEPER 
OF SHEEP BY WILLIAM CARPENTER , MILKWEED EDITIONS, $21.95, 327 PAGES

 "Overhead there were stars, and I thought of each one of them as a cocktail 
party sending its fragile verbal energy into the chill of space," says Penelope 
(Penguin) Solstice, the narrator of William Carpenter's first novel. She is at 
an earthly cocktail party, in Squid Harbor, on Cape Cod, recently expelled from 
Dartmouth for torching a fraternity house where a gang rape occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, Richard, a metal sculptor, arrived earlier with his new wife and 
former student, Dorothy Dvorjak. Penguin has already discovered one of 
Dorothy's sculptures, a web of wire that "looked alive, and although it was 
small . . . it seemed to threaten every sculpture in the room, every piece of 
furniture and even the house itself. It was the only non-living thing I had 
ever seen that looked like it was about to grow." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy's art is portentous. It symbolizes the novel's larger threat -- the 
AIDS virus, brought to Squid Harbor by Arnold Fratorelli, a composer and lover 
of Joshua Brand, the Solstices' longtime friend and next-door neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold is trying to finish his last composition, an arrangement of the poems 
of Fernando Pessoa, to be called "The Keeper of Sheep." Because she is close 
by, energetic and idle, Penguin agrees to become a keeper of Arnold, taking 
care of him while Joshua is away. 
</P>
<P>
 And she becomes Arnold's champion, defending his right to live and die in 
Squid Harbor against the ignorance and mounting hysteria of other residents, 
who fear infection, perhaps through mosquito bites. In the course of the novel, 
Penguin works to understand her relationships with family and friends and 
learns to feel -- not just think -- her way through life. 
</P>
<P>
 Penguin says of herself and her contemporaries, "We are so . . . privileged 
that we don't even exist," and sadly, it's true. It's hard to believe or care 
for the world of "perfectly transparent" martinis, repartee, and literary 
allusion in which much of this novel moves. Penguin's search for self takes 
place behind a lot of clever talk, and it's tiring to listen to. And in the 
end, her transformation from self-absorption to compassion gets drowned out by 
talk. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, AIDS seems like just another topic of conversation, rather than a 
real issue. One wishes the writer himself recalled an early passage, in which 
Squid Harbor residents have been discussing the spread of the AIDS virus, and 
then Penguin imagines, "the words dissolved into the night air and became as 
invisible as the microbes they supposedly described. There were places words 
couldn't reach though, like the actual sickness of a real person." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the novel's real strength is language. William Carpenter is also a poet, 
and that sensibility is alive everywhere. The characters are linked by 
Penguin's dreams in which the writing is simple, stark, the images concrete and 
powerful: ruined houses, wounded animals, burned bodies. Some of these images 
grow with the novel. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the chapters in which Penguin and Arnold are alone together 
are the most memorable, the writing clean and moving: Arnold's "face was white 
and narrow and the veins were so close to the surface that it seemed like the 
top layer of skin had come off. His lips were crazed with the same white lines 
only more pronounced than ever. He was freshly shaved too. In places. It looked 
like somebody had hacked off his beard with a flint knife. He held on with both 
hands to the satin edge of the white cotton blanket as if his bed were in 
fearful and violent motion, like a man holding a crossbar of a roller coaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Penguin has an uncanny ability to say exactly the right thing to him, whether 
it be consolation or gentle reprimand. She learns patiently and stoically to 
feed Arnold, move him, clean him, administer injections and oxygen. In these 
scenes, she's finally quiet, and the prose is tender, compelling. "I was still 
holding Arnold's book of poems. On its slick dust jacket was a single red drop 
the color of the world at sunset that was darkening and congealing on the 
glossy surface. It looked and acted like typical human blood. It hardened into 
itself as if to shield a tiny wound on the surface of the book. Within that 
drop, the red and white cells swam in a clear medium that would taste like a 
memory of the sea . . . I touched the end of one finger to the half-coagulated 
blood, then brushed my forehead with it at a place above and between the eyes." 
This act of marking is more resonant than any of Penguin's talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course words and talk are all any novelist has to tell a story. A novel 
lives in the space between invented talk and the thing or things that happened, 
between, as Penguin says, "how we want things to be and how they are exactly." 
So, "A Keeper of Sheep" is at its best when Penguin's talk meets the very real 
force of Arnold's suffering. These moments do send "fragile verbal energy into 
the chill of space," and they are full of risky, original power.

 Interview With the Cops: Christian Slater was ordered to appear in court Jan. 
27 after his arrest Friday for trying to carry a gun onto a plane. The actor 
spent about eight hours in jail after he was caught trying to carry a 9mm 
pistol onto a Delta Airlines flight at Kennedy Airport in New York, police 
said. Slater, 25, was arrested as he went through a metal detector. He was 
charged with criminal possession of a weapon and released on his own 
recognizance after being arraigned. In 1990, Slater was sentenced to 10 days in 
jail and placed on five years' probation after he pleaded no contest to his 
second drunk driving charge in a year. TELEVISION

 Rush Maddens Mall-Goers: Rush Limbaugh doesn't even have to be around to stir 
up a protest. A small shopping mall kiosk in Columbus, Ohio, is drawing a big 
crowd -- of pickets -- for selling items like mugs, sweatshirts and bumper 
stickers with the talk-show host's likeness. Protester Steve Rosenberg said the 
store perpetuates Limbaugh's bigotry and half-truths. "We consider Rush 
Limbaugh to be political pornography," Rosenberg said. Owner Bill Khourie

 As the Cast Turns: The CBS soap opera "As the World Turns" will be losing 
several favorite cast members in the next few months. One of the first to leave 
will be Scott Bryce, who created the role of Craig Montgomery in 1982. He is 
slated to exit in early 1995 and the soap has no plans to recast the role. Also 
leaving early next year is Tamara Tunie, who began playing the role of Jessica 
Griffin in 1987 and currently has an ongoing role in ABC's prime-time series 
"NYPD Blue." CBS does, however, plan to recast Tunie's role. To conceal future 
story line developments, however, the network will not presently reveal the 
other actors who will be leaving the show.

 Real Life: Last Thursday's episode of "My So-Called Life" hit home for Wilson 
Cruz. "It's a realistic, sad fact that many teens get kicked out of their house 
because of their sexuality," said Cruz, a gay actor who plays the 
makeup-wearing, sexually confused Rickie Vasquez on the ABC show. "I got one 
letter the other day, from a 13-year-old boy in Ohio, who said he knows exactly 
what Rickie's going through," Cruz said. "He said he can never tell his parents 
or anyone in his community. But at night, he's thought of committing suicide. 
Toward the end of the letter, you could see teardrops on the paper." Cruz said 
the teen-ager included his telephone number, so Cruz called him. "I told him 
not to believe his life would be some unhappy myth, that he would be OK," Cruz 
said.

SCIENCE EDUCATION -- HOW KIDS CAN LEARN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prospects for better science teaching in American public schools have been 
markedly improved by proposed new national standards for science education. But 
the standards mean little without a commitment from local school districts, 
universities and businesses to provide the resources, leadership and staffs to 
reverse a deterioration in American scientific literacy that threatens the 
nation's economic future. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue here is not producing more scientists and engineers; they are in 
surplus now. Rather the issue is to provide the wider public with an 
understanding of how the natural world operates, both to equip people for 
21st-Century jobs and to arm them against forces of ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
 Until fairly recently, American schools were doing a terrible job at that. 
Five years ago, the average youngster in grades kindergarten through five spent 
only 33 minutes a week on science. Today it is up to 2.5 hours, far from good 
but better. 
</P>
<P>
 The standards were written by a panel of the National Research Council, an arm 
of the National Academy of Sciences. They attempt to spell out, from 
kindergarten until high school graduation, what youngsters should know about 
science. 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis throughout, though, is not on memorizing the periodic table of 
elements and other tasks that drove generations of students up the wall -- and 
away from science. Rather, the stress is on science as an exciting process of 
discovery and inquiry. Students should be taught how to construct and test 
scientific hypotheses, gather and evaluate evidence. These are lessons that can 
be valuable in many spheres of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Before graduation, the standards say, students should grasp the molecular 
basis of heredity and evolution, not just to understand the chemistry involved 
"but because of the need to take informed positions." The media, after all, are 
filled with technical news concerning such subjects as health, the environment, 
reproduction and communication. 
</P>
<P>
 These new standards are not the only effort in this area. The National Science 
Teachers Assn. has mounted a project to redefine the entire scope and sequence 
by which high school students study physics, chemistry and biology. And many 
local districts and schools have made remarkable strides. The Pasadena Unified 
School District, for example, has won national attention for its imaginative 
program, meant to bring science into every classroom at every grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Much more needs to be done. The new standards are entirely voluntary. Local 
districts must give new emphasis to science. Also, major corporations and 
universities should recognize they too bear a responsibility to make their 
experts available to help local schools. At least this is one national problem 
that is not getting worse.

A CHANCE TO REPAIR A PAINFUL MISTAKE; CONGRESS SHOULD SIGN OFF ON CLINTON MOVE 
TO GRANT LOS ANGELES AN EMPOWERMENT ZONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles didn't lose everything when the Clinton Administration failed to 
award a much-needed federal empowerment zone to the beleaguered city. As a 
consolation prize, Washington has promised $125 million for economic 
development and an additional $300 million in federal loan guarantees from HUD. 
That one-time allocation is welcome, but it falls far short of a 10-year 
empowerment zone complete with tax breaks for employers and millions for new 
social spending in blighted neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles' troubles were exactly what Congress had in mind when it 
authorized empowerment zones. This region has been battered by a lingering 
recession, riots, a devastating earthquake and other disasters. The economy may 
finally be turning around, but neither the private nor the public sector has 
recovered fully from all the piling-on. Unemployment remains higher than the 
national average, and poverty is on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 In fairness to the rest of the nation, the empowerment-zone legislation set 
seemingly objective criteria that allowed all cities to compete. Even so, that 
Los Angeles was knocked out of the box is nothing less than a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 There is plenty of blame to go around for why the city lost the prize. An 
application pathetically weak on detail and lacking in parallel public and 
private commitments evidently could not compare to the specific visions of the 
victorious cities. For example, both New York City and New York state promised 
to match Washington's money. Chicago banks put together a $2-billion package of 
loans to leverage the federal investment. Baltimore pledged eight dollars for 
every dollar allocated under an empowerment zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, in Los Angeles, commitments from many sectors may not have been 
forthcoming because the state and city are scraping by and many corporations 
still have not recovered from the recession, the riots, the earthquake and 
other blows to the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, keenly aware of California's 54 electoral votes, 
is trying to put the best face on this bad situation. So is the embarrassed 
Riordan Administration, though the mayor was so angry Wednesday he refused to 
participate in a conference call the President hosted. The truth is, the city 
should not have been shunted aside, flawed application or not. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton is expected to ask Congress to approve an empowerment zone 
just for Los Angeles, and we hope the GOP majority in Congress will support the 
request. California's gold mine of electoral votes may provide a second chance 
for an L.A. empowerment zone. As this region struggles to rebound, nothing less 
from Washington will suffice. On its merits, Los Angeles deserves the help.

THE COMMISSION SAYS: OK, WE'LL DO THE JOB; MONITORING OF POLICE REFORM TAKEN 
AWAY FROM LAPD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three years ago, in the wake of the landmark Report of the Independent 
(Christopher) Commission on the Los Angeles Police Department, critics of the 
police force and committed police officers alike were finally hopeful that the 
LAPD would soon see happier days. They were looking forward to a time when the 
memory of the horrible and unnecessary beating of Rodney G. King would fade, 
when the memory of aloof headquarters administration would fade, when the 
memory of insensitive policing would fade. For bedeviling the collective 
consciousness was the notion that the LAPD had become a law unto itself and 
this was a city that had allowed its police department to get out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 The new hope seemed well-placed, for a while. Almost the entire city embraced 
the fair-minded but forward-looking 1991 Christopher report, and in June of 
1992 the voters of the Los Angeles passed, by an overwhelming margin, sweeping 
police reforms that created new civilian controls on the LAPD and new term 
limits for the police chief so that it would be impossible for another chief to 
resist accountability. 
</P>
<P>
 That same spring, a new chief arrived -- Willie L. Williams, from 
Philadelphia. Finally Los Angeles had in place a top police official who was 
truly committed and enthusiastic about reform. And it had in place a veritable 
blueprint for reform, in the Christopher recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Williams has established himself as the city's most popular 
official, and almost overnight police-community relations, on the whole, seemed 
much improved. But for all this, most people who knew the true score about 
police reform were getting more worried by the day. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, the chief, popular outside the department, was clearly having 
difficulty getting control of this deeply entrenched, civil service-insulated 
police bureaucracy, and the department seemed somehow to be losing momentum -- 
if not sliding back to the old ways, at least settling into a comfortable 
catalepsy. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part Mayor Richard Riordan, who had made a more efficient 
law-and-order system and more progressive policing the main planks of his 
mayoral election campaign in 1993, was becoming alarmed; Chief Williams was 
becoming discouraged, and the Police Commission was increasingly concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 Then last week the Police Commission stirred and rose up. Unhappy about the 
pace of change and disquieted by the Police Department's own sometimes mixed 
and sometimes muddled updates about what was going on under the reform tent, 
the commission stripped the department of the primary authority for 
investigating the status of the reforms and decided to do the job itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Charter does give the panel the authority to supervise the 
department; it's good to see the panel, which too often was cowed by the chief 
under the previous police administration, assume more of its rightful duties. 
"It's our responsibility to do this," said Rabbi Gary Greenebaum, a member of 
the commission. "We believe this will expedite the reforms, which is our job." 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Commission is to be congratulated for possessing both the good 
judgment and courage to take on this crucial but difficult job. The panel 
evidently hopes to develop a continuing audit of the reforms and to present its 
findings from time to time to Chief Williams. That's a terrific idea. Our only 
suggestion would be to conduct these reviews regularly, such as two or three 
times a year, and to make the findings public. The people, as well as the 
chief, have a right to know.

 Re "Rocking Role Model," Dec. 20: Here is my advice to Hermosa Beach Mayor 
Robert (Burgie) Benz. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget the music business.Stay in politics. Because you never, ever will 
impact a music audience as much as you will influence a political constituency. 
</P>
<P>
 Take it from me, a former music industry honcho. No matter how outrageous you 
may appear, you can never be outrageous enough to satisfy a fan following 
accustomed to the likes of Henry Rollins (a true eccentric) or an Ozzie 
Osborne, who made a bizarre attempt to reach Nirvana-like notoriety when he bit 
off the head of a dove, and whose career has never matched his adolescent 
promotional exploits. And how about formerly-known-as-Prince, speaking of 
bizarre. Or Michael Jackson. Doesn't anyone care about Kurt Cobain anymore? 
</P>
<P>
 The point, Burgie, is that the music industry in all of its infantile wisdom 
still regards strange behavior with a certain affection. It welcomes, demands 
even, eccentrics. Politics needs them. Did someone mention Jefferson or Tom 
Paine or Lincoln? Someone who, in your words, "questions authority"? 
</P>
<P>
 Stay in politics where you are necessary, not in the music business where you 
will be redundant. Otherwise we turn things over to Newt and Dan Quayle and Bob 
Dornan and Pat Robertson. Oddballs, to be sure, but dangerous and sour and 
vindictive. Burgie, you are a beacon of truth and reason. We need you. So does 
your country.

 I take strong issue with Patrick Buchanan's use of Friedrich Nietzsche's 
philosophy as a progenitor of Nazi ideology.Yes, Nietzsche had strong 
disagreement with Christianity on a number of issues and one was the 
"herd-animal virtues of the so-called good and the just in society." 
Nietzsche's philosophy is so diverse and at times contradictory that what he 
wrote can be taken out of context and used to promote one's own agenda. But 
what is uncontestable is his great anti-Fascist writing called the "New Idol" 
in his 19th-Century masterpiece "Thus Spoke Zarathustra."

TAX-CUT PROPOSALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your report on President Clinton's Dec. 15 address displaces any thought I 
might have had that he is not looking to the future. He is. In fact, it was 
quite obvious that this was the opening shot of his 1996 reelection effort.

 * It is fashionable nowadays for politicians to insist on lowering our taxes. 
I must admit that I like lower taxes. It should be remembered, however, that 
before tax breaks help a family, the income must be enough to be taxed. 
</P>
<P>
 Then we are faced with the consequences. Some government agency is cut back in 
order to pay for the tax cut. This takes a part of government out of our lives 
and we are freer to "live better." 
</P>
<P>
 But living better very often depends on our needs and our family's needs. We 
hear some sad stories about education needs being out of the reach of potential 
students because of tax cuts. Many people's needs are put out of reach by tax 
cuts. 
</P>

<P>
 * Doesn't any elected official have the guts to say we don't need a tax cut at 
this time? 
</P>
<P>
 I think most economists would agree that a tax cut should be used when the 
economy is faltering. According to Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board, 
etc., our economy is still in an expansion phase. In fact, the Federal Reserve 
raised interest rates six times this year to halt an overheating economy and 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 So why a tax cut now other than to pander to the voters of both parties? 
</P>
<P>
 If a tax cut is inevitable, at least we should remember that those still 
suffering in this expansion are the unemployed and underemployed who would be 
helped least of all. I would hope that injury would not be added to insult by 
reducing their benefits to help pay for a tax cut.

 * Tax cuts proposed by President Clinton appear to be fair (targeted toward 
the working middle class), wise (with federal assistance for education and job 
training), reasonable (since IRA funds can be withdrawn without penalty not 
only for retirement, but also for education, major illness, buying a first 
home, caring of elderly parents) and responsible (by major restructuring of 
federal agencies with sizable cuts, along with spending cuts in order to 
prevent the deficit expanding again, like in the '80s). Wonder why it took him 
so long?

 * I am a parent, but have both parties forgotten that a lot of middle-class 
workers aren't? In a few years my sons will be grown and I will no longer be 
able to claim them as dependents. Do I lose my tax cut? Yes. Those who are 
single or don't have children never even get one.

CRACK COCAINE EPIDEMIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "The Real Cost of Crack" series, Dec. 18-21: At last we are offered a 
comprehensive view of the destruction visited on all of us caused by the abuse 
of crack. My wife and I are foster parents and are adopting two babies born 
addicted, and we have had ample opportunity to view firsthand the horrifying 
effects of this ugly epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
 I, personally, have come to the conclusion that nothing will save our society 
except to stop this scourge at its source. That is, we need a comprehensive 
effort to prevent crack-addicted parents from bringing children into this world 
who are virtually all dumped on society for us to deal with. We need to divert 
money to birth control clinics (lots of them) where addicted mothers can get 
free abortions, tubal ligations or Norplant, along with some kind of monetary 
reward for coming in. We need to offer mothers who deliver addicted babies the 
choice of tubal ligation and help with their addiction, or we need to give them 
jail time. 
</P>
<P>
 Harsh? Not at all. Harsh is a baby going through months of agonizing 
withdrawal. Harsh is having to grow up with no one to truly love or care for 
you. Harsh is trying to cope with life with a severely damaged nervous system.

 * "The Hidden Devastation of Crack" (Dec. 18) is wrong-headed and exacerbates 
the very problem it is presumably trying to help. The major problem with the 
article is its thesis, which seems to be that crack is so powerful, people are 
victims of its seduction. Crack users are no more victims of this mind-altering 
substance than are drinkers of alcohol. It is a matter of personal choice, for 
which the individual is responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the National Institute on Drug Addiction's annual household 
survey, the percentage of people between ages 18 and 25 (the most drug-prone 
years) that had used an illicit drug during the last month declined steadily 
from 37% in 1979 to 15% in 1991. Even allowing for changes in the age range of 
the population during that period, this suggests that, while overall drug use 
was declining, many who became crack users were simply changing from one drug 
to another, rather than being snared anew by the irresistible pull of a new 
demon drug. 
</P>
<P>
 The sooner we start placing the responsibility for drug abuse on the 
individual, rather than on the drug, or society, or economics, or a flawed 
childhood, the sooner we will begin directing our anti-drug efforts toward 
prevention through education and help through treatment.

 * As reported, crack has made Skid Row a younger, meaner place. And as we have 
long stated, lack of housing is not the problem. Willingness to spend income on 
housing is the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Newly employed "graduates" of our award-winning shelter, Transition House, 
have never had a problem locating appropriate housing. Our challenge lies in 
making homeless people employable and educating them to spend their money on 
housing and not on drugs.

focused so much on African American people. The ravages of crack go beyond that 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 I have some expertise on this subject, since I'm a so-called drug war refugee. 
I lived for years in a crack-infested neighborhood three blocks from MacArthur 
Park, until we finally had to flee due to death threats. I observed that the 
majority of the buyers were white. I saw obviously affluent men as well as 
suburban homemaker types with children in safety seats purchasing crack on my 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be really informative to investigate how all races, ages and income 
brackets have been involved in spreading the disease of crack cocaine.

 Re "LAPD Lingo," Dec. 19:

 Not only is duis pronounced deuce it is also spelled deuce. This term comes 
from a shortening of the former Vehicle Code section, "502," which stated the 
offense of driving under the influence from 1935 until 1959. (The offense is 
presently stated in Vehicle Code section 23152.) As in a game of cards, the two 
becomes a deuce. "DUI" is simply the abbreviation for "driving under the 
influence."

COLUMN RIGHT/ JONATHAN CLARKE: SABER-RATTLING BY REPUBLICANS IS ILL-ADVISED; 
INSTEAD OF EXPANDING NATO EASTWARD, GIVE PRIORITY TO A CONSERVATIVE PLAN FOR 
EUROPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN CLARKE, Jonathan Clarke, a member of the British diplomatic service 
for 20 years, is now at the Cato Institute in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In determining their November vote, most Americans probably paid little regard 
to foreign military policy, except perhaps to feel that the Republicans would 
display a surer grasp of American interests than would the Clinton 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 It is still early, but the warning signs are already flashing: The initial 
pronouncements of senior Republicans on such subjects as Bosnia, NATO and North 
Korea contain all too much political posturing unrelated to real events on the 
ground. If this continues, we may be headed back to the dark days of early 
Clintonism when big talk made do for clear-headed analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 This will disturb anyone who hoped that the Republicans would set about 
restoring America's reputation and influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving aside some of the more reckless statements about an all-out bombing 
campaign against Serbia and saber-rattling about overturning the nuclear 
agreement with North Korea, the most serious issue revolves around NATO and the 
future of European security. The disarray at the meeting of the Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe earlier this month demonstrates that a 
dangerous security vacuum exists in Europe. Given that two world wars have 
started in Europe, it is very much in American interests that new and credible 
security structures fill that vacuum. This is precisely where Republican 
realism is most needed -- and, alas, where it is most lacking. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of forcing the Administration and the Europeans to make the necessary 
hard decisions, the Republicans are abetting the game of Washington and 
European make-believe. If, as some argue, Russia is re-emerging as a potential 
threat, this is the very worst way to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 To deter aggression, Europe requires what the French call "hard" security -- 
cast-iron guarantees that, in certain circumstances, military forces will be 
available to honor treaty obligations. Throughout the Cold War, the Soviets 
knew beyond doubt that the United States would respond massively to any attack 
on NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 Compare this to the situation today. As a response to security jitters in 
Central Europe, NATO proposes to expand eastward. This means that American GIs 
would be called on to defend the eastern borders of Poland and Hungary. Not 
only does this entail new commitments against a potentially resurgent Russia, 
but, just as likely, it would draw the United States into the murky arena of 
Central European ethnic rivalries. Just when public opinion strongly rejects 
foreign entanglements, the American global cop would be given a new precinct to 
patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 If this is to be a "hard" commitment, the implications are enormous: a massive 
increase in defense spending; a return to Cold War levels of 300,000 American 
troops in Europe and a reversal in the public sentiment against American 
casualties in ambiguous causes. Unless these conditions are fulfilled, the new 
obligations will not be worth the paper they are written on -- any more than 
were British and French pre-World War II guarantees to Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
 This produces a situation in Europe whereby nations think that they enjoy 
security, but in practical fact do not, which can lead to disastrous 
miscalculation. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this is unknown to experienced Republican foreign-policy experts. Yet 
instead of insisting that the Administration come clean with the American 
people, the Republicans are conniving in the pretense that American resources 
and American lives remain available to sort out Europe's problems. Aggressors 
everywhere know that this is not true. And so the European security vacuum 
remains dangerously unfilled and ominously ready to suck in American combat 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The way around this dilemma is to forget talk of NATO expansion and, in its 
place, work toward a new European security system on a continent-wide basis. 
The great American achievement after World War II was to re-integrate Germany 
into the West European family of nations. Today's challenge lies in developing 
a system to perform that task for Russia. Unilateral American efforts cannot 
accomplish this. Instead, the United States should focus on strengthening 
structures like the CSCE, the West European Union and the Franco-German 
Eurocorps. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans are ideally placed to restore American credibility. Their 
philosophy of limited government and matching resources to objectives puts them 
in tune with public opinion. This will enable them to re-create the consensus 
under which U.S. commitments meant what they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Honesty in foreign policy may not win many short-term votes, but -- dare one 
say it? -- may be good for the national interest.

DEMOCRACY FIRST, ELECTIONS LATER; PALESTINIANS: POLITICAL LEGITIMACY ISN'T AS 
IMPORTANT AS BUILDING THE CIVILIAN FRAMEWORK FOR A DEMOCRATIC STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMADEDDIN FRAITEKH, Emadeddin Fraitekh is a Palestinian American writer in 
Washington. He grew up in the West Bank city of Nablus. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Debate is escalating among Palestinians on the significance of holding 
elections for a governing body for the self-rule areas of the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip. These elections are called for in the secretly signed Oslo 
agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, but not in 
the later, formal Cairo agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 PLO officials consider such elections a vital lifeline for the Palestinian 
Authority led by Chairman Yasser Arafat and, thus, for the entire peace process 
with Israel. They specify two reasons for this view: Elections will expedite 
the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Palestinian-inhabited cities of the West 
Bank and will give the PLO political legitimacy. But do the Palestinians really 
need elections at this historical and extremely sensitive juncture, when their 
survival as an independent political entity is at stake? The answer is a 
definite no.  
</P>
<P>
 The right to vote and hold free elections is indeed noble; the right of 
citizens to choose their government is a tool for guaranteeing other rights in 
a democratic society. But elections per se are not an ultimate goal; democracy 
is. 
</P>
<P>
 Free elections bring tremendous responsibility that requires citizen awareness 
of the consequences of the choices made. If elections are to be truly free, 
then the electorate must also be free. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinians are not yet a free people, not only because of Israel's 
continuing occupation of territory that is home to more than 1 million 
Palestinians in the West Bank, but also because they lack a fundamental 
requirement for free elections: a choice of political parties with media access 
to the electorate and clear agendas, platforms and vision that can evolve into 
legitimate civilian government. 
</P>
<P>
 The current organizations lack concrete economic or social plans, and the 
interim Palestinian Authority is burdened by poorly delineated power-sharing 
between civilian political figures, most of them long affiliated with the PLO, 
and veterans of Arafat's military organization, Fatah. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinian police force in the self-rule areas, drawn largely from Fatah, 
is more like an armed militia than public servant, and its clear political bias 
will create problems during elections. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no Palestinian TV or radio stations; newspapers and magazines are 
the only media outlet for political campaigning and they are frequently 
confiscated by the police force or prevented from circulating in the self-rule 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Under such undemocratic practices, independent candidates would find it 
impossible to reach the people, thus circumventing democracy before its 
inception.  
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinians have a long way to go on the road to a democratic state, but 
they have started the journey in the right direction. They sincerely chose to 
enter into peace talks with Israel, agreeing on a limited self-rule formula for 
the West Bank and Gaza. Their freedom is now conditioned on the provisions of 
the Oslo and Cairo accords. By virtue of political necessity, Israeli security 
requirements and Palestinian internal affairs, these provisions are extremely 
restrictive. Insisting on elections under these circumstances will only add a 
new layer of limitations to the Palestinian Authority's already circumscribed 
powers. 
</P>
<P>
 The period of Palestinian self-rule ought to be utilized for the creation of a 
democratic Palestinian society, rather than for testing Palestinian political 
legitimacy. I am not suggesting that the Palestinians should submit to a 
dictatorship or ignore the political, financial and administrative corruption 
among the senior ranks of PLO officials. On the contrary, a careful and 
rigorous investigation of alleged mishandling of power must be undertaken by 
local and international human-rights groups. But elections in non-democratic 
societies can be, and have been, widely manipulated to serve the agenda and 
interests of those in power. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinians should not focus foremost on their leaders' need to establish 
political legitimacy. Rather, they should be concerned about their leaders' 
abilities to transfer the Palestinian society from one that is based on 
nepotism and tribal relations to one in which democratic behavior is the norm, 
not the exception. 
</P>
<P>
 What is needed at present is the development of democratic Palestinian men and 
women through the establishment of democratic institutions based on limited -- 
but free -- elections. While such institutions currently exist -- 
municipalities, chambers of commerce, labor unions, student councils, 
professional associations and so on -- they are anything but democratic. These 
institutions, along with Palestinian universities and other national and 
international non-governmental organizations, must carry on a massive campaign 
to educate the Palestinian public about democracy and all that it entails. 
Thus, the very concept of free elections will be incrementally introduced to 
the Palestinians by individuals and institutions that practice the democracy 
they preach. 
</P>
<P>
 Rightly, the Palestinians are exceptionally sensitive to the "policy of 
appointment," but they should distinguish between Palestinians who earned 
appointment and those who were appointed by Israeli authorities during the 
self-rule stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Palestinians see Yasser Arafat as a classic dictator, but they do not see 
him as a traitor. Though he may not be a canny philosopher, he is not a 
political blockhead, either. If the spread of Palestinian self-rule to the West 
Bank is being hindered because of disagreements over elections, Palestinians 
should let Arafat enjoy his absolute authority in the self-rule period to 
ensure that they reach the next stage -- an independent democratic state.

COLUMN LEFT/ RUTH ROSEN: WHICH OF US ISN'T TAKING 'WELFARE'?; POOR CHILDREN 
RANK LOW IN GOVERNMENT LARGESS; WHY IS THE COMFORTABLE CLASS SO MEAN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH ROSEN, Ruth Rosen, a professor history at UC Davis, writes regularly on 
political culture. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The best-kept secret in American politics is that we are all welfare 
recipients. Most of us don't know it or are unwilling to admit it. 
</P>
<P>
 Laid-off executives grab their unemployment insurance. Well-off senior 
citizens refuse to give up their Social Security checks. Homeowners deduct 
mortgage interest, college students depend on government loans and businesses 
and farmers rely on federal incentives and subsidies. The government even bails 
out failing banks and corporations. Just recently, Labor Secretary Robert B. 
Reich noted that $200 billion in "corporate welfare," mostly in the form of tax 
breaks and subsidies, constitutes one of the most expensive forms of federal 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 So why has the nation declared war on the welfare mother and her children? And 
who will defend them? 
</P>
<P>
 Having "won" the Cold War, the United States now faces a competitive battle in 
the global marketplace. Many Americans, anxious and insecure over their 
uncertain economic prospects, wonder whom to blame for their children's bleak 
future. This is the politician's job: to find plausible scapegoats. Welfare 
recipients and immigrants, like Communists of the 1950s, perfectly fill the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The welfare recipient is a particularly good scapegoat. Through endless 
repetition, the political right has saturated the culture with sinister 
stereotypes of the single mother on welfare: She's poor, deceptive and 
slovenly. She neglects her children and spends taxpayers' hard-earned wages on 
drugs or booze. Oh and by the way, the color of her skin is dark. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that many studies have repeatedly debunked these stereotypes. Much 
of what the public thinks it knows about welfare mothers is simply wrong. 
Consider the following facts that never seem to penetrate the welfare debate: 
</P>
<P>
 * The typical welfare mother in 1993 received an average monthly payment of 
$367, or $4,400 a year. Even with food stamps, no state provides benefits 
adequate to bring families above the poverty line. 
</P>
<P>
 * The typical welfare family consists of a mother and two children, slightly 
less than the size of the average American family. 
</P>
<P>
 * Welfare to single mothers constitutes only 1% of the entire federal budget, 
3% if food stamps are included. 
</P>
<P>
 * African Americans represent only 38% of the AFDC population, but they are 
constantly portrayed as the main recipients of welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 * More than 70% of women on welfare are on the rolls for less than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many welfare mothers work outside the home when they can. When they stay at 
home to care for their children, they are condemned as lazy. When affluent 
married homemakers do the same, they are praised for their maternal devotion. 
</P>
<P>
 * Welfare has helped many single mothers gain an education and enter the 
workforce. Rep. Lynn Woolsey (D-Petaluma) and Rosemary L. Brey, former editor 
of the New York Times Book Review, are two of the many women whose lives once 
were "saved" by receiving federal assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of abolishing most forms of welfare has become this season's panacea 
for curing America's social and economic ills. In our current Orwellian 
Newtspeak, "welfare reform" has become a euphemism for welfare cuts; "unwed 
mother" means any mom without a male breadwinner, whether she is separated, 
divorced, abused, abandoned or widowed, and "illegitimate child" is the label 
for any kid not claimed by a male breadwinner. 
</P>
<P>
 In early January, Newt Gingrich and gang will introduce the so-called Personal 
Responsibility Act. In pushing thousands of poor off the welfare rolls, it is 
actually an act of profound social irresponsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the time for all humanitarian organizations to place welfare defense 
at the top of their political agendas. The Catholic bishops, who have opposed 
these cuts, should join forces with civil-rights and human-rights groups to 
combat these punitive proposals. The women's movement should emphasize its 
commitment to poor women by holding speak-outs at which the real-life stories 
of welfare mothers can be heard. Oprah and Donahue should broadcast programs 
that give welfare moms a human face. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone agrees that our current system is unworkable and inadequate. Real 
welfare reform would require training, health care, child care and real jobs 
for poor women. Our first principle must be: No workfare without child care. 
</P>
<P>
 As we enjoy a holiday season that celebrates mercy and compassion, let us 
remember that we all are welfare recipients and that many of us are just one or 
two paychecks removed from homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 Real welfare reform must be directed at ending poverty, not at eliminating 
welfare.

VIKINGS BEAT 49ERS, WIN TITLE; PRO FOOTBALL: S.F.'S 10-GAME STREAK HALTED, 
21-14, AS YOUNG, RICE SCORE EARLY, THEN LEAVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Only the Minnesota Vikings had something to gain from Monday night's final 
regular-season game, and they got what they needed -- a tough defensive 
performance and the NFC Central championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Dewayne Washington returned a fumble for a touchdown and John Randle 
had two of the Vikings' three sacks in a 21-14 victory over San Francisco, 
snapping the 49ers' 10-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels great," Viking cornerback Anthony Parker said. "We wanted to win the 
Central Division, that's the bottom line. But we let it slip away from us too 
many times, and it was important for us to finally get it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings (10-6), who won with Sean Salisbury at quarterback instead of the 
injured Warren Moon, will play host to the Chicago Bears in a playoff game 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers (13-3) were already assured of the home-field advantage throughout 
the playoffs, causing Coach George Seifert to give many regulars extra time 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Steve Young and receiver Jerry Rice left the game after connecting 
on a six-yard touchdown pass that tied the score, 7-7, on the second play of 
the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to run, we're like thoroughbreds, and when George pulls the reins in, 
guys are ticked," said Young, who still set two NFL records. "Guys don't want 
to be held back, but we understand. We'll get mad and take it out on the next 
opponent." 
</P>
<P>
 Young surpassed Joe Montana's passer rating of 112.4, set in 1989, with a 
112.8. Young also broke Ken Anderson's NFL record for completions of 70.55%, 
set in 1982, with a 70.7%, connecting on 325 of 460. 
</P>
<P>
 Young completed 12 of 13 passes before leaving. His 35 touchdown passes broke 
Montana's team record of 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice caught four passes to move into second place behind Art Monk on the NFL 
all-time list with 820, one ahead of Steve Largent. 
</P>
<P>
 Young and Rice were the first 49ers to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice agreed with Young's assessment that it was hard to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I hate games like this," Rice said. "I felt I was just getting 
into a groove."

NBA ROUNDUP; PRICE RIGHT FOR CAVALIERS AS STREAK REACHES NINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's no telling how many points Mark Price might have scored if Monday's 
game at Cleveland had been close. 
</P>
<P>
 Price made a team-record seven three-point shots and scored 36 points as the 
Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Boston Celtics, 123-102, for their ninth 
consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cavaliers' streak is two short of the franchise record of 11 set last 
February and March. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing only 27 minutes, and not at all in the fourth quarter, Price made all 
but two of his nine three-point shots and converted a rare four-point play. 
</P>
<P>
 "You think, 'Maybe I could get 50 today,' but I'm not like that," he said. "We 
have guys who've worked hard all year, and this was their chance to get 
significant minutes. That's more important to me than saying, 'Coach, I'd like 
to stay in and get a few more shots.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 128, Washington 121 -- Nick Anderson scored a season-high 35 points, 
including 11 in the fourth quarter and four in overtime, to lead the Magic at 
Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Anfernee Hardaway scored 29 and Shaquille O'Neal had 28 for the Magic before 
fouling out with 1:04 to play in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Juwan Howard had a career-high 24 points and 14 rebounds for the 
Bullets, who played without injured starters Chris Webber, Don MacLean, Rex 
Chapman and Kevin Duckworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 139, Dallas 113 -- Kevin Johnson scored 20 points at Phoenix as the 
Suns extended their home winning streak to 25 games over two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Jackson of Dallas, the NBA's No. 2 scorer, matched his average with 28 
points, but the Mavericks couldn't recover after falling behind, 94-70, on 
Johnson's conversion of the second technical on Maverick Coach Dick Motta, who 
was ejected with 4:09 to play in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 101, Miami 88 -- Mario Elie scored the Rockets' first 11 points of the 
fourth quarter to propel Houston at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Hakeem Olajuwon had 24 points, 12 rebounds and seven blocked shots and Elie 
finished with 19 points. Carl Herrera scored 15 points on seven-of-eight 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 For Miami, Glen Rice, who scored 37 and 30 points in his last two games on 
23-of-44 shooting, finished with 20 points, making eight of 22 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 101, New Jersey 97 -- Vin Baker scored 11 of his 26 points in the 
fourth quarter and Glenn Robinson finished with 20 to lead the Bucks at 
Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 123, Sacramento 103 -- Reserve Sam Perkins scored a season-high 26 
points and Detlef Schrempf added 21 to lead the SuperSonics at Tacoma, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 101, Portland 94 -- Clarence Weatherspoon scored 21 of his 23 
points in the second half to lead the 76ers at Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 NBA Note

 Doc Rivers, 33, a 12-year veteran guard waived this month by the New York 
Knicks, signed with the San Antonio Spurs.

WITHOUT RIDER, TIMBERWOLVES BEAT CLIPPERS; PRO BASKETBALL: L.A. CAN'T 
CAPITALIZE ON SUSPENSION OF MINNESOTA'S TOP SCORER AND FALLS, 82-81. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The indignities pile on top of the defeats for the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday they couldn't beat the Washington Bullets despite Chris Webber's 
absence. On Monday, after the Minnesota Timberwolves suspended team scoring 
leader Isaiah Rider for one game without pay because he missed their morning 
shoot-around, the Clippers again failed to take advantage of a potentially 
vulnerable opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been a real tough game to lose because they're the only team 
with a worse record than us, and we needed a win," said forward Christian 
Laettner, who scored a season-high 26 points to rally the Timberwolves to an 
82-81 victory before a crowd of 12,338 at Target Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking we should be able to beat them without J.R. (Rider), and we 
did," Laettner added after the Timberwolves (6-19) won for only the second time 
in 12 home games. "We didn't play well the first three quarters. Some guys were 
going easy because they thought they could do that against the Clippers. But 
you can't do that." 
</P>
<P>
 To an extent, the Clippers, who fell to 3-23 after their fifth consecutive 
loss, beat themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 They led, 40-34, at halftime and by six with 8:41 left in the game, but Chris 
Smith -- who replaced Rider -- and Laettner carried the Timberwolves to a 75-71 
lead with 3:25 to play. The Clippers led, 78-76, after Terry Dehere made a 
driving layup with 1:08 to go, but after Laettner made a free throw to bring 
Minnesota within a point, Loy Vaught missed a jumper -- one of only two misses 
on a night he scored a team-high 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Timberwolves called time out with 32.1 seconds to play and took the lead 
for good when Laettner, down low, found Pat Durham for a wide-open three-point 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Durham, who was released by the Timberwolves after training camp and re-signed 
out of the CBA on Nov. 24, made the shot near where the old three-point arc was 
painted until it was moved this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the Timberwolves. We don't rely on artistic performances," Durham said. 
"We'll take every win we can get." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers had a chance to take it back with about eight seconds left, but 
Pooh Richardson's three-point attempt from the left side hit the rim. "I went 
to run the play and they were shading to that side, so I tried to bring the 
defense the other way," Richardson said. "There was no way that was the way it 
was drawn up." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was fouled by Dehere and missed both free throws with 6.5 seconds to 
play, but in the scramble for the rebound, as Vaught and Lamond Murray 
converged on Durham, the ball went out of bounds and was awarded to the 
Timberwolves with 4.6 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Laettner, fouled by Vaught with four seconds to play, made both free throws to 
make it 82-78. Murray made a three-point shot with half a second left for the 
final margin. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bag of 'ifs' when you get to one-pointers, two-pointers. You're a shot 
away, a call away," Clipper Coach Bill Fitch said. "It hurts like hell whether 
you've lost 23 or lost none. They hurt. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing about it, I think every guy that was in the ballgame can think 
of one play that was worth one point. One rebound, one missed free throw, one 
point he didn't get. It's something for everybody to put on their pillow 
tonight. They (his players) played hard and deserved to win." 
</P>
<P>
 That, for the umpteenth time, had to suffice for the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was difficult. All of them are," Richardson said. "But you have to play 
hard. You can't give up. You've got to keep working." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the Timberwolves' philosophy too. Laettner said he was surprised by the 
number and enthusiasm of the fans, since the Vikings were playing the San 
Francisco 49ers at the nearby Metrodome with the NFC Central Division title at 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe they see the light at the end of the tunnel," he said. "Sometimes I do, 
and sometimes it seems to be blocked out, but that doesn't mean you stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Grant, who is participating in shoot-arounds as he completes his recovery 
from arthroscopic surgery on his left knee, probably won't be activated until 
after this trip.

MORNING BRIEFING: IS IT ALL A CELTIC PLOY TO LAND AIR JORDAN? 
</P>

<P>
 News that the Celtics are interested in purchasing the Red Sox fascinates 
Boston Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Green Monster will be the ultimate symbol of the Celtic empire," he 
writes. "The Celtics can put ads on Fenway's left-field wall. Maybe they can 
make the ads rotate, the way they do at courtside at the Garden." 
</P>
<P>
 And, Shaughnessy muses, the venture could produce an ideal cross-pollination 
plan for the Celtic general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "M.L. Carr is going to love this," Shaughnessy adds. "Now he can go to Chicago 
Bulls executive Jerry Krause and make a deal for the rights to talk to Michael 
Jordan. And when M.L. talks to Mike, he can offer him the Celtic backcourt and 
right field in Fenway." 
</P>

 Trivia time: Before this season with the Rams, Chuck Knox had been known for 
turning a team around in at least three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Excluding this year, what was the lowest number of victories for a Chuck 
Knox-coached team in his third season?

 One Heisman, one vote: One of the 920 Heisman ballots mailed recently went, as 
the rules stipulate, to O.J. Simpson. All previous Heisman Trophy winners 
receive ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 And, writes Filip Bondy of the New York Daily News, Simpson's ballot was 
filled out, signed and returned to the Downtown Athletic Club, which runs the 
award. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not all of the ballots were returned," Sean Ingram, coordinator of the award 
committee, told Bondy. "But his was. I know that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Heisman: Six quarterbacks won the Heisman Trophy from 1984-93, but only 
one has won a full-time NFL starting job, Sport magazine's Sport Index points 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 The non-starters are Doug Flutie, Andre Ware, Ty Detmer, Gino Torretta and 
Charlie Ward. 
</P>
<P>
 The only one to win a starting job? Vinny Testaverde. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Did he drop the hot dog? After the Philadelphia Phillies signed Gregg 
Jefferies, General Manager Lee Thomas said Jefferies, formerly a second 
baseman, third baseman and first baseman, could "get by" in left field. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferies sounds willing to give his fourth position in four years a try. "The 
only time I ever played left was one inning in a Little League all-star game," 
Jefferies said. "I probably had a hot dog in one hand and a glove in the 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not-so-stirring streak: According to Ed Bouchette of the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette, Jack Ham, the Steelers' Hall of Fame linebacker, isn't overly 
impressed with Art Monk's record-setting streak of catching a pass in 179 
consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 Ham agrees that Monk is a standout receiver, but chuckles at the 
record-keeping. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made at least one tackle in every game that I played," Ham said.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My choice for sportsman of the year competed only once in 1994. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But George Foreman's 10th-round knockout of Michael Moorer on Nov. 5 at the 
MGM Grand Garden in Las Vegas was one for the ages. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman became the oldest heavyweight champion ever at 45, and, even more 
remarkably, regained the title 20 years after he lost it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He is also believed to be the first world-class athlete to return to his sport 
successfully after a 10-year retirement. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 What makes Foreman the sportsman of the year in the fullest sense are his 
charitable endeavors. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Not too long ago, a financial crunch hit the Houston food bank that helps 
people afflicted with AIDS. Officials approached Foreman. He responded by 
writing a check for $400,000. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 After the riots in 1992, Foreman wrote a check for $1 million to help build a 
pharmacy in South-Central L.A. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He also has endowed scholarships at the universities of Texas and Nebraska. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 It is estimated that he has donated more than $4 million to charity throughout 
his career. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If this comes as a surprise, it is because he makes his contributions without 
calling attention to them. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, nobody else carried the wallop of the champion in 1994. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Sanders' most impressive number might be his 726 consecutive carries 
without losing a fumble. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The last time he lost the ball was on Dec. 6, 1992, against the Green Bay 
Packers at Milwaukee County Stadium. I'll bet it never happens to him again 
there. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Miami Dolphins would be a bigger threat in the playoffs if Reggie Roby was 
still their punter. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 My idea of a football nut is someone who planned his or her Christmas Day 
schedule around telecasts of the Blue-Gray game, the Aloha Bowl and the 
Miami-Detroit game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If you enjoyed soccer's World Cup, you must have loved the Boston 
College-Kansas State game in Honolulu that included 19 punts. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 ESPN sideline reporter Mark Malone, the former quarterback, deserves a spot in 
some broadcasting booth next season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I guess some Miami assistants wear those "Dolphins Football" sweatshirts on 
the sidelines so they won't be confused with "Dolphins Basketball" coaches. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Pacific 10 Conference preseason favorite Arizona be up for the Freedom 
Bowl against Utah tonight at Anaheim Stadium? The Wildcats need only remember 
their 21-16 loss to Western Athletic Conference member Colorado State at Tucson 
in October. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State graduate Brian Golden conducted a talk show on KABC with Doug 
Krikorian last week while wearing a Nittany Lion helmet and jersey. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne would be smart to start quarterback Brook Berringer 
against Miami in the Orange Bowl and use Tommie Frazier, coming off his injury, 
as a change-up artist. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Walton, who is Ralph Lawler's partner on Channel 13 telecasts, says life 
with the Clippers is more fun than a year ago. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "That team lost a lot of games that it should have won and there was a lot of 
bickering," Walton said. "These guys put out much more." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Walton, who also does commentary on UCLA games for Prime Ticket, is bullish on 
his alma mater. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't surprise me if they win the national championship," he said. 
"They're deep and have incredible team quickness. Ed O'Bannon has matured. He's 
bigger across the shoulders and can do more things." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 UCLA should get off to a fast start in the conference race. The Bruins' first 
four games are on the road at Oregon and Oregon State on Jan. 5 and 7 and at 
home against Washington and Washington State on Jan. 12 and 14. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona must open at Arizona State on Jan. 5. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the NBA's most underrated players is Houston forward Otis Thorpe, who 
recently passed the 13,000-point mark. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Elliot Perry, a guard who is contributing heavily to the Phoenix Suns, was cut 
by the Clippers in 1991 after being drafted in the second round from Memphis 
State. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Among the highlights on closing day at Hollywood Park were the calls of Frank 
Mirahmadi, who did a fantastic job imitating Trevor Denman in one race, the 
late Harry Henson in another and several announcers in a couple of others. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 It looks as though Foreman's opponent on April 22 at the Superdome in New 
Orleans will be the famed Axel Schultz of Germany.

NEWSWIRE: NHL, PLAYERS MIGHT RESUME TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Negotiations between representatives of the NHL and its players association, 
which stalled in the past week and further jeopardized the start of the 1994-95 
season, might resume today or Wednesday at a site to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 A league source said he was "virtually certain" a meeting would be arranged 
today, but was not sure if it would take place today or be put off until 
Wednesday. No talks were held Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 No full-scale negotiations have taken place since Dec. 6 between Bob Goodenow, 
executive director of the NHL Players Assn., and Commissioner Gary Bettman. 
However, subcommittees from each side have met three times to discuss possible 
solutions to the lockout, which is in its 88th day. HELENE ELLIOTT

L.A. UNIVERSITY BEAT / WENDY WITHERSPOON: PEPPERDINE WOMEN COUNT ON 'ICE' 
GETTING HOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No one is looking forward to trying to break the Ice this season in the West 
Coast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because "Ice," whose full name is Iseth Cowan, has arrived at 
Pepperdine, where she is expected to lead the women's basketball team back to 
prominence. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowan, a 6-foot-2 junior forward, was selected as California's co-player of 
the year last season after leading Butte Junior College (30-4) to the 
semifinals of the state tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was just an outstanding shot-blocker and rebounder," Butte Coach Greg 
Sheley said. "Her best (asset) was her athleticism for her size. At least at 
the junior college level, you don't see that very often." 
</P>
<P>
 Cowan's athleticism is not the only remarkable thing about her. Her unusual 
first name, Iseth (pronounced i-SETH ), also is a conversation piece. 
</P>
<P>
 She is named after Isabelle Elizabeth Munro, an actress who had appeared in 
several silent movies with Charlie Chaplin and was a friend of Cowan's mother. 
Munro, who died in 1967, condensed her first and middle names to Iseth for the 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowan's nickname on the basketball court, Ice, is a derivative of that. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cowan was destined for the hardwood rather than the silver screen, 
her initial basketball forays were inauspicious. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowan played for two weeks in the seventh grade at a private junior high in 
her hometown of Ukiah. However, her basketball career was interrupted when the 
school's head nun decided that Cowan would be better off concentrating on her 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
 At Ukiah High, the girls' basketball coach noticed Cowan because she was tall, 
and asked her to try out for the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had just gone through a major growth spurt," Cowan said. "I was really long 
and lanky and I wasn't used to controlling my body yet. Dribbling the ball and 
shooting were (skills) I couldn't do." 
</P>
<P>
 She played on the junior varsity that year but soon gained mastery over her 
long limbs and became a leader on the varsity. She was an all-North Bay League 
selection in her junior and senior years and was recruited by several colleges, 
including Cal State Fullerton and Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
 But because Cowan was young for her grade -- she had skipped the second grade 
and was only 17 when she graduated from Ukiah -- her mother decided that she 
was not mature enough to balance the pressure of basketball and academics at a 
four-year college. 
</P>
<P>
 So, Butte gained an NCAA Division I-caliber player and vaulted to the top of 
the Golden Valley Conference. Cowan was a two-time all-conference selection and 
last season set school single-season records with 672 points and 361 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowan credits Sheley with helping her develop skills uncommon to a player of 
her size. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just gave me a lot of freedom and that gave me confidence to expand as 
player," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually every West Coast Conference school, as well as several Pacific 10 
Conference schools, recruited Cowan before this season. She chose Pepperdine 
for its location -- "It was not in the hustle and bustle of L.A." -- and for 
its enthusiastic new coach, Mark Trakh. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine was mostly a middle-of-the-pack team in the conference from 1983 
through '93 under then-coach Ron Fortner, who ended his Pepperdine career 
131-153 (.461). Trakh, who led the Brea-Olinda High girls' team to four state 
championships from 1986 through '93, brought new vitality to the Wave program 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He pushes you as far as he thinks you can go," Cowan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowan will try to help Trakh improve on his first season at Pepperdine, when 
the Waves finished 13-13 overall and tied for fifth place in the conference at 
6-8. 
</P>
<P>
 If Cowan keeps up her early pace this season -- she is averaging a 
team-leading 11 points a game -- the Waves (4-2) could contend for their first 
conference title. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it the Ice Age. 
</P>

 If Ed Burt is anywhere near as good a coach as his mentor, the USC women's 
tennis team can expect a successful season. 
</P>
<P>
 Burt, who was given an interim coaching position earlier this month after 
Cheryl Woods resigned, said Dick Gould is the person who has most influenced 
him. Gould has led the Stanford men's tennis team to 12 national championships 
since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 Burt began coaching in a recreation program that Gould ran at Stanford years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Gould) has worked with me a great deal in understanding that you have to 
adapt to players and. . . communicate with players on a high level," Gould 
said. "I definitely would like to follow suit with the type of program he has 
developed." 
</P>
<P>
 Burt was coach of the Cal State Fullerton men's team in 1982-84. More 
recently, he has been running his own sports training business, and served as 
an assistant for the UC Irvine men's team last season before being named 
assistant women's coach at USC in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 USC won NCAA titles in 1983 and '85 under then-coach Dave Borelli, but had 
slipped under Woods, whose record was 76-67 (.531) in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 If Burt can return USC to national prominence, it probably will help his 
chances of being given the permanent position when USC associate athletic 
director Lisa Love makes her search after this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Burt has inherited a Trojan roster with high potential. It includes highly 
touted freshmen Nicole London and Pam Trump, as well as returning seniors 
Maggie Simkova, Suzanne Italiano and Petra Schmitt. 
</P>
<P>
 USC will compete in the National Collegiate Tennis Classic at Palm Springs 
Jan. 7-9.

VALLEY-AREA ROUNDUP; CRESCENTA VALLEY GIRLS SHAKE OFF VILLAGE CHRISTIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DESMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was near halftime when Crescenta Valley High girls' basketball Coach Marc 
Ward came to a conclusion.  
</P>
<P>
 "If Village (Christian) was going to beat us, it was going to have to be from 
the inside," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward extended his Falcons' defense to the perimeter at halftime and turned the 
Crusaders inside out in a 62-50 victory in a second-round game of the Thousand 
Oaks tournament Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Amirah Leonard scored 16 of her 34 points in the first quarter to help 
stake Crescenta Valley (10-3) to a 25-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But the defensive adjustment was needed after Village Christian (8-3) 
connected on four consecutive three-pointers during a two-minute span of the 
second quarter, helping to close an 11-point margin to 33-30 at intermission. 
The Crusaders managed only one three-pointer in three attempts in the second 
half. While Village Christian's outside game floundered, Crescenta Valley's 
flourished. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard, a junior guard, made five three-pointers and opened up the inside for 
the undersized Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the best game she's ever played at C.V.," Ward said of the third-year 
varsity player. "And this was her 62nd game with us." 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Michelle Greco added 11 points and 14 rebounds for Crescenta Valley. 
The Falcons, who started three juniors, a sophomore and Greco, outrebounded the 
Crusaders, 43-26, despite a considerable height disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
 All-Southern Section forward Lindy James scored 21 points for Village 
Christian, 14 in the first half. Village Christian struggled against the 
Falcons' full-court pressure and committed 29 turnovers. In the first half, the 
Crusaders turned the ball over 16 times, leading to 21 Crescenta Valley points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crusaders' third loss equals their total from last season, when they 
advanced to the Southern Section Division IV-A championship game and Southern 
California semifinals and posted a 26-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not at all pleased with my team's effort," said Village Christian Coach 
John Domke. DAVE DESMOND

FAMILY; ROBBO MAKES IT PARTY TIME FOR KIDS WITH 'SPACE ALIENS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Blanket Kid" may not mean anything to you, but it does to anyone familiar 
with children's entertainer Robb Zelonky. It's the silly signature routine 
eagerly anticipated by fans who attend the locally based singer's concerts at 
malls and toy stores. Zelonky, known professionally as Robbo, is building a 
following because of his good-natured original songs and musical stories based 
on the ups and downs of childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbo's latest album -- "Space Aliens, It's Party Time!" -- doesn't break new 
ground with a musical delivery that varies from comical Vegas lounge act-style 
and rock 'n' roll, to old-time jazz. But the result, complemented by several 
accomplished musicians, is pleasant and kid friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbo explores emotions in "Sometimes Ya Gotta Have a Cry" and in an early 
rock-style ballad, "Don't Wanna Share," and confronts fears in the bluesy "Shot 
Blues" and the jazzy, cautionary "Strangers."

PROPERTY VALUES: A WEEKLY COLUMN BY RON GALPERIN: DEFERRING A HOME SALE TO NEXT 
YEAR COULD REDUCE TAX BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ron Galperin 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's time to close the books on 1994 and to figure out if there's anything 
that can be done to minimize your tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
 One tip that some politically minded accounting experts suggest is to defer 
the sale of your home into 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? The Republican Party's so-called "contract with America" has a provision 
that -- if it becomes law -- could save some home sellers a great deal of money 
starting next year on their income taxes. Current law doesn't allow taxpayers 
to claim a loss on the sale of their principal residence. For many sellers in 
the San Fernando Valley, who have watched home prices nose-dive this decade, 
they have not been able to get any tax relief when they sell their homes at a 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the Republican Congress has its way, taxpayers who sell their homes 
next year would get to claim some loss on the sale to offset other income. 
"This proposal will get a lot of discussion. It's clearly on the agenda for the 
first 100 days of the Republican Congress," said Joseph Knott, partner in 
charge of the Los Angeles tax practice of the accounting firm Kenneth Leventhal 
& Co. in Century City. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be prudent for sellers who are losing money to defer their (home) 
sale to next year," he said. Of course, it's not a sure thing that the proposal 
will become law, but at least it does hold out some hope for sellers who face a 
loss on their homes. To be safe, Knott advised, home sellers should defer their 
sale until at least Jan. 3 -- when Congress reconvenes. 
</P>
<P>
 One existing tax advantage for homeowners falls into the arcane category of 
"casualty losses," including damage from the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But things are complicated because not all "casualty losses" are 
tax-deductible. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the math on casualty losses is Byzantine, an IRS specialty. That's 
because the IRS requires homeowners who suffer a casualty loss to report the 
lesser of the following: A) the difference between the fair market value of the 
property just before and just after the earthquake, or B) the "adjusted cost 
basis" -- the real cost -- of your residence, minus 10% of your adjusted gross 
income, plus $100. 
</P>
<P>
 The adjusted basis is the purchase price of a home, plus any permanent 
improvements added while you owned that home. (If you owned a home before and 
you deferred paying a tax on the profit by buying another home, the adjusted 
basis of the first home is added into the tax basis of the second home.) 
</P>
<P>
 To give one example: Say the Smith family had a Northridge home that was worth 
$700,000 before the earthquake. But the quake ravaged the place, and its fair 
market value is now only $300,000. This family lived in their home more than a 
decade, so the adjusted basis of their home is a modest $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the difference between the "before" and "after" value of their home 
is a whopping $400,000, for tax purposes, the Smiths can only write off a total 
casualty loss of $104,900. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? This couple has an adjusted gross income of $150,000; after subtracting 
$15,100 (10% of their adjusted gross income, plus $100) from their $120,000 
adjusted cost basis of their home, they wind up with only $104,900 in casualty 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 More information about the cost basis of your home is available in a free IRS 
booklet entitled "Tax Information on Selling Your Home." To get it, call the 
IRS at (800) TAX-FORM. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the Northridge quake left you facing a foreclosure on your home, guess 
what? You may also owe a capital gains tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Much depends on what kind of mortgage you have. 
</P>
<P>
 If you still have the original home loan, under state law, this is considered 
a purchase money loan, or as the trade calls it, a "non-recourse" loan. This 
prevents the lender from going after you in court to make up any difference 
between the remaining amount of the loan and what the foreclosed home is now 
worth. But if you have refinanced your mortgage, chances are you're not 
protected by the state law, and in theory, the lender could chase after you to 
make up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep in mind that you could also owe the IRS a capital gains tax even if your 
home is now worth less than the property's mortgage, or if you previously owned 
another home and sold that at a profit, but deferred that tax by purchasing 
another home. 
</P>
<P>
 So either from the sale or foreclosure of a property, you could owe some 
capital gains taxes. Therefore, keep your eye on another Republican proposal, 
in which capital gains taxes could be slashed by 50% starting in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, as with almost anything involving taxes, the rules are so complicated 
that it may be advisable to get professional help from a CPA or an attorney 
familiar with real estate tax issues.

 Thousand Oaks-based GTE California, locked in a battle for toll-call customers 
with AT & T and other rivals, says its parent, GTE Corp., is switching from 
single- to double-sided bills, saving "the equivalent of 3,000 80-foot trees 
every year." . . . Ventura County's office vacancy rate at year-end stands at 
16%, down from 21% a year ago, Grubb & Ellis Co. reports.Industrial and retail 
vacancies are down, too. "At year-end, Ventura County had the second-lowest 
vacancy rate of any major industrial market in Southern California and, in 
1995, it may move past the San Gabriel Valley into first place," Grubb 
declares. . . . LTC Properties Inc., an Oxnard-based real estate investment 
trust, raised its fourth-quarter cash dividend to 29 cents a share, up two 
cents from the previous quarter. . . . Ventura County's jobless rate in 
November was 7.7%, up from 7.6% in October but down from 8.2% a year ago. 
Retail hiring was up last month, but agricultural jobs declined as usual this 
time of year, the state Employment Development Department reports.

VENTURA COUNTY ROUNDUP: CALIFORNIA AMPLIFIER FINISHES MULTICIPHER TEST

<P>
 California Amplifier Inc., a Camarillo producer of equipment used in 
broadcasting television signals, says it has successfully completed an 
important test for MultiCipher, its wireless cable broad-band encryption 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 The test was conducted over a 10-week period at Oahu Wireless Cable Inc., a 
new cable system in Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman said California Amplifier has moved into the final stage of 
product development and expects to start marketing the system shortly. 
</P>
<P>
 Wireless cable systems use terrestrial microwave transmissions instead of 
hard-wire coaxial cable used by traditional cable systems. The MultiCipher 
system is designed to protect wireless signals from piracy through the use of 
signal encryption. 
</P>
<P>
 Ira Coron, California Amplifier's chairman and chief executive, described 
MultiCipher as "an extremely cost-effective, broad-band scrambling system for 
wireless cable operators." 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that MultiCipher will contribute to further sales growth of our 
wireless products in fiscal year 1996," he said, adding that sales of the 
products have increased more than 40% in the first nine months of fiscal 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Oahu Wireless is scheduled to launch 29 channels of TV service to Honolulu and 
its suburbs in February. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very pleased with the successful test," said Steve Berkoff, Oahu 
Wireless president. "We are moving forward with plans for system launch." 
</P>
<P>
 California Amplifier's products include amplifiers, down converters and 
integrated subsystems used in wireless cable systems, home satellite dishes and 
commercial satellite earth systems.

VENTURA COUNTY ROUNDUP: INTEREST RATES BLAMED FOR HOME SALES DECLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Higher interest rates are among the factors blamed for a decline in home sales 
in October by members of the Conejo Valley Assn. of Realtors and the Simi 
Valley-Moorpark Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Valley group, whose members work in Thousand Oaks, Newbury Park and 
nearby areas, said October sales of single-family houses totaled 213, compared 
with 235 in September and 184 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Condominium sales totaled 54 in October versus 61 the previous month and 51 in 
October, 1993, the group reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The median sales price for houses in October was $267,000, up from $262,000 a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Median prices in October were $170,000 for two-bedroom houses, $230,000 for 
three bedrooms and $298,000 for four or more bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Total sales for all transactions by Conejo Valley members in October was $79.7 
million, compared with $67.6 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 New listings in October totaled 322, compared with 345 in September and 328 in 
October, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Simi Valley-Moorpark association said 119 houses closed escrow 
in October, down from 182 in September and 133 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The average sales price paid for houses was $242,000 in October -- an increase 
over $222,000 in September and $220,000 in October, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi-Moorpark agents sold 13 condominiums in October, compared with 20 the 
previous month and 23 a year earlier. The average condo price in October was 
$122,000 versus $117,000 in September and $130,000 in October, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports from both groups contrast with a yearlong upward sales trend. 
Shanon Wolf, president of the Simi-Moorpark group, noted that resale activity 
normally declines in the fourth quarter, but that this year's 35% 
month-to-month decline in house sales was 10% steeper than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Except for the effect of higher interest rates on home loans, I think the 
drop-off would have been identical to what we saw last year," she said.

 Grubb & Ellis Co.'s Oxnard office has been named marketing agent for the 
former Fidelity National Title Building in northeast Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 James D. Gloyd, the same agent who originally sold the site to Fidelity, will

</P>
<P>
 Fidelity purchased the property at Rice Avenue and the Ventura Freeway in 
1988. The title company built the 28,000-square-foot structure, which Gloyd 
sold to a private investor. Fidelity has occupied 9,000 square feet of the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 The area has been the scene of considerable development in recent years. 
Projects have included Shopping at the Rose center, the Oxnard Factory Outlet 
mall, St. John's Regional Medical Center and the former Chevron USA building, 
now occupied by GTE California.

 SOUTH VS. NORTH? How do you get out from under Orange County's bankruptcy? 
Form your own county. There's been small talk about this before, of course. But 
now Irvine Councilman Greg Smith is serious about it. . . . The county's 
southern cities, he says, have had it with county supervisors over the El Toro 
air base feud and the county's bankruptcy. He adds: "Forming a new county is an 
alternative we need to look at." . . . Question is: What would he call it?

 DIAL-A-MATH: If your children are having trouble with their math or science at 
school and it's too over your head to help them, there is a Homework Hotline 
they can call. It's (714) 896-5569 or (800) 876-3867, with assistance available 
during after-school hours. It was started two years ago by a group of whiz 
minds from the Huntington Beach office of McDonnell Douglas. Says one of its 
engineers, John Grefe: "We help them through the problem but we don't give them 
the answer. We love the subjects. Our reward is when we inspire them." 
</P>
<P>
 SUPERIOR IDEA: Only four women sit on Superior Court here. Central Municipal 
Judge Marjorie Laird Carter wants to see those numbers improved -- and not 
because she wants herself elevated. . . . "We have many, many women Municipal 
Court judges who are eminently qualified for Superior Court," she says. Carter 
recently was elected to the National Assn. of Women Judges board. One of its 
major goals: Getting more women on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 MILITANT BIKERS: After claiming victory in a battle to get bike lanes on 
Laguna Canyon Road, the Orange County Bicycle Coalition has a new target: 
Imperial Highway. The coalition is urging bicycle riders to lobby Yorba Linda 
and La Habra officials to support bike lanes for Imperial Highway when it's 
improved and renovated. . . . Says coalition spokesman Don Harvey: "It's not 
smart to build a street without bike lanes, especially one of the very few 
major east-west routes in North County."

JOHN E. BOSWELL; HISTORIAN OF GAY MARRIAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 John E. Boswell, a Yale historian who provoked debate with his research saying 
gay marriages during the Middle Ages were celebrated in the church, died Friday 
of the complications of AIDS. He was 47. 
</P>
<P>
 Boswell drew national attention in June with his book "Same-Sex Unions in 
Premodern Europe," a study of more than 60 manuscripts from the Middle Ages. 
</P>
<P>
 Boswell contended that homosexual marriages were well established in the 
medieval church. But Boswell's thesis was criticized by other scholars. He 
wrote that one major aim of his work was "to rebut the common idea that 
religious belief -- Christian and other -- has been the cause of intolerance in 
regard to gay people." 
</P>
<P>
 Boswell joined the Yale faculty in 1975 as an assistant professor. He was 
appointed a full professor in 1982.

ROSSANO BRAZZI, 78; ACTOR STARRED IN 'SOUTH PACIFIC' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rossano Brazzi, who played a series of aristocratic romantics in films ranging 
from "South Pacific" to "The Barefoot Contessa" before reverting to character 
parts in his later years, has died in Rome, Italian news agencies said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them, ANSA, quoting sources close to the actor's family, said Brazzi 
died Saturday in a Rome hospital from an undisclosed virus that affected his 
nervous system. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazzi played in more than 200 movies. Many of the most successful were filmed 
in the United States in the 1950s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 His first Hollywood appearance was in "Little Women" (1949), but it was "The 
Barefoot Contessa" (1954) that made him a star specializing in roles as a Latin 
lover or well-heeled playboy. 
</P>
<P>
 His compelling magnetism probably was best typified in two films: "South 
Pacific" (1958), in which he played the cultured French planter opposite Mitzi 
Gaynor as the Army nurse who learns to love him, and "Summertime" (1955), in 
which he seduced spinster Katharine Hepburn despite being a married man with 
several children. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of his other U.S. box-office successes included "Three Coins in the 
Fountain" (1954), "Woman Times Seven" (1967) and "Krakatoa, East of Java" 
(1969). 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Bologna, Italy, he was left an orphan when Mussolini's Fascists killed 
his parents. Brazzi studied law before turning to the stage and made his film 
debut in 1939. His success in the Italian cinema was immediate. He became a 
full-fledged U.S. movie presence in "The Barefoot Contessa," which featured 
Humphrey Bogart as a director and Ava Gardner as a Spanish dancer who becomes a 
Hollywood star. Brazzi portrayed Count Vincenzo Torlato-Faurini, who weds 
Gardner and then kills her over sexual frustrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazzi made headlines of a different kind in 1984 when he was among 37 people 
indicted after an investigation of an international arms and drug smuggling 
ring operating in Italy, West Germany, Spain, Bulgaria, Turkey and other parts 
of the Mediterranean. The case against him was later dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Until his illness he had been working in a film where he played the role of an 
Italian prosecutor, ANSA reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include his second wife, Isle Fischer. His first wife, Lydia 
Bertolini, died in 1981. His funeral will be Wednesday in Rome.

JOHN OSBORNE; PLAYWRIGHT WROTE 'LOOK BACK IN ANGER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Osborne, the Oscar-winning playwright who made his mark as one of the 
"angry young men" of British theater and who kept up his iconoclastic conduct 
long after, has died of heart failure in a hospital near his home in 
Shropshire, a spokesman said Monday. He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne's seminal play, "Look Back in Anger," transformed British theater in 
1956, opening the way for what would be described as "kitchen sink" drama -- 
the portrayal of the gritty realism of working-class life that also reflected 
the playwright's own background. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Porter, the antihero of "Look Back," railed against the Establishment 
and its values, as did the author, who became a voice for the disgruntled of 
Britain's post-war generation. Richard Burton starred in a 1958 film version of 
the work. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne won his Oscar for his screenplay of the 1964 film "Tom Jones." 
</P>
<P>
 Among his other notable works are "The Entertainer," which many critics saw as 
a metaphor for a declining Britain and which starred Sir Laurence Olivier, 
"Luther" and "Inadmissible Evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Osborne updated the Jimmy Porter story with a new play, "Deja Vu," in 
which his old hero now lives comfortably but rages against homosexuals and 
"luvvies," theatrical and literary folk. The work was a critical and box-office 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne in his private life adopted the angry man persona. He was notorious 
for his hard drinking and irascibility. In a recent interview, he asked: "Who 
wants to live to 110 anyway if it means not smoking and not drinking?" 
</P>
<P>
 Married five times, he savaged some of his wives in his autobiography and 
called his mother "hypocritical, self-absorbed, calculating and indifferent." 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Dawson, his fifth wife, was at his hospital bedside when he died 
Saturday. His other wives were Pamela Lane, actress Mary Ure, writer Penelope 
Gilliatt and actress Jill Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne described Bennett in his memoirs, "Almost a Gentleman," as "the most 
evil woman I've ever come across" and called her suicide the "coarse posturing 
of an overheated housemaid." 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne was a fixture on the London theatrical scene and became notorious for 
firing off letters to newspapers and speaking out on a range of topics that 
piqued him. 
</P>
<P>
 He once said critics were "nearly all cripples suffering from some terrible 
disease." At the Writers' Guild Awards in London two years ago, he denounced 
British theater as "this horrible profession which has never been held in more 
contempt." 
</P>
<P>
 In his polemic "Damn You, England," he ripped his country, saying of it: 
"You're rotting now, and quite soon you'll disappear . . . untouchable, 
unteachable, impregnable." 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne began his career as an actor but started writing plays at age 19. He 
moved from London to Clunton, Shropshire, in a deliberate attempt to flee the 
literary Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon his death, which occurred after he was hospitalized for a diabetic 
condition, his friends took note of his abundant bile but also praised his 
talents. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a revolutionary writer," playwright Arthur Miller said. "He opened up 
British theater . . . and I suppose everybody is indebted to him for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne "was wonderfully vindictive," Sheridan Morley, an author, playwright 
and critic, said. "He took no prisoners, gave no hostages. He was full of 
loathing . . . and yet there was a richness of language in John. He wrote 
wonderful roles, wonderful speeches. . . . What is important is the energy of 
the man. He had this tremendous raging against the light. Whatever it was, John 
was there to hate it."

BIG BARGAINS LURE HORDES OF SHOPPERS TO THE MALLS; RETAIL: THOUSANDS DESCEND ON 
AREA STORES TO RETURN GIFTS AND SPEND CHRISTMAS CASH ON STACKS OF NEWLY 
DISCOUNTED ITEMS.

<P>
 A confessed mall maniac, 21-year-old Jennifer Dransfeldt of Camarillo says she 
and her friends can sniff out a bargain like a shark smells blood. 
</P>
<P>
 So when she spotted those leather dress shoes Monday at Nine West in the 
Oxnard Factory Outlet -- priced down from $80 to $50 -- she knew she could not 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have nothing in particular that we need," Dransfeldt said. "We're just 
looking for the big sales." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of post-holiday shoppers descended on Ventura County malls and 
retail stores Monday to return gifts and take advantage of after-Christmas 
sales. For many stores, the surge of shoppers served as a generous supplement 
to a profitable holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely did an incredible amount of business," said Wanda Fatzinger, 
customer service manager for The Oaks. "(Sales) were up approximately 15%." 
</P>
<P>
 Some eager shoppers began showing up at county stores as early at 7:30 a.m., 
even though many did not open until 9 a.m. The Buenaventura Mall in Ventura was 
bustling with activity, and in Thousand Oaks, traffic around the The Oaks 
ground to a standstill by noon as shoppers struggled for a place to park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We traveled around the whole mall for about 30 minutes fighting for a parking 
space," said Oxnard resident Marlene Carty, a patron at The Oaks. "I've never 
seen it this bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Many shoppers knew what they wanted, and it was not what they had received 
Christmas Day. For some of them, however, the tedium of returning gifts was 
wearisome. 
</P>
<P>
 "I waited at one counter, then I waited at another one," said Monica Rodriguez 
of Ventura, who spent 40 minutes at the Broadway at Buenaventura Mall trading 
in a watch her mother got her for Christmas. "I've been waiting a long time, 
and I'm getting tired of this." 
</P>
<P>
 At Target in Ventura, rows of people waited up to an hour to return unwanted 
Christmas gifts. Dennis Molloy of Camarillo was in line to return a Mighty 
Morphin Power Rangers talking pinball machine his 6-year-old, Timothy, had 
received. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy already had a pinball machine, and Power Rangers or not, he did not 
need another, Molloy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wants to get something that Santa didn't bring," Molloy said. "Like a new 
bike." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Toys R Us in Ventura, the return line streamed out the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not safe," said Harian Hochberg of the toy table she bought Alyssa, 
her 9-month-old granddaughter. "She kept standing up and cracking herself in 
the head." 
</P>
<P>
 The 14-year-old King twins, Erica and Nicole, were flipping through the CD 
racks at Sam Goody's in the Buenaventura Mall on Monday, eagerly looking to 
cash in the $30 gift certificate their cousin had given them for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 But they had one problem: They could not agree on what to buy. Pantera or Tom 
Petty? The Offspring or Nirvana? 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a new CD player for Christmas and now we need something to play in 
it," said Erica. "Now we just have to decide what we want." 
</P>
<P>
 At The Oaks, a Camarillo resident who was shopping with his son stopped by a 
pet store to browse, but walked out with a $1,500 parrot for his wife. Afraid 
his friends would tease him about the impulsive purchase, the man declined to 
give his name. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figure we'll surprise her," he said, of his wife's supplementary Christmas 
gift. "She'll be excited -- she wanted a bird." 
</P>
<P>
 Pets were popular gifts this year. At the Animal House in Thousand Oaks, 
puppies and bunnies were top-sellers in the days before Christmas, employees 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Christmas Eve we sold seven dogs," said Jamie Freiberg, assistant manager at 
Animal House. "For one day, that was really good." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the store's 37 pooches were snatched up by holiday buyers, including a 
golden retriever, Scottish terrier, sheltie, Pekingese and a few beagles. "I 
think the dachshund went too," Freiberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Victoria's Secret, dozens of shoppers pawed through piles of satin panties 
while about 10 people waited in line to return or purchase marked-down 
lingerie. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great season," store manager Kim Kama said. "Today we had a lot of 
customers coming in not only for exchanges but also for the sales." 
</P>
<P>
 Darting off to a popular teen-age clothing store, 12-year-old Nate Wray of 
Newbury Park said her $62 in Christmas money wouldn't last long. "I have lots 
of money," she said, "so I'm spending it."

HOMICIDES IN THE COUNTY DROP SHARPLY IN '94; CRIME: TWENTY-EIGHT RESIDENTS HAVE 
BEEN SLAIN THIS YEAR, DOWN FROM 47 IN 1993. BUT POLICE REPORT MORE 'STRANGER' 
SLAYINGS, REFLECTING A NATIONWIDE RISE IN GANG ACTIVITY.

<P>
 As usual, neighbor killed neighbor, rival shot rival and man murdered wife in 
Ventura County in 1994. But far more victims are dying at the hands of 
strangers, law enforcement officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 28 county residents have been slain so far this year, a dramatic 
drop from the 47 homicides in 1993, which authorities said was an unusually 
violent year. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not far from 1992's total of 32 homicides, and officials called the 
drop-off just part of the roller-coaster pattern that homicide statistics tend 
to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just didn't go out and kill as many people. It goes like that," said 
Coroner's Investigator Mitch Breese. "There's no set anything for homicides. 
They can be up for a while, they can be down for a while. . . . There's no 
rhyme or reason for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the reasons for killing have become more haphazard, said 
Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard E. Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The motives often seem to be more trivial," said Holmes, a veteran prosecutor 
who oversees the district attorney's major crimes unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more 'stranger homicides' than in the past, where the victim and 
the defendant are unknown to each other," he said. "It's random violence, as 
opposed to, 'This had been building up and I couldn't stand it any more.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI report on 1993 crimes noted a sharp increase in random killings by 
strangers nationwide, partly due to an increase in gang crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every American now has a realistic chance of murder victimization in view of 
the random nature the crime has assumed," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 A respected Oxnard soccer coach died in just such a "stranger" shooting last 
summer, and police are still searching for the gang member who they suspect 
killed him. 
</P>
<P>
 Armando Balderama, 20, apparently grew upset that Roberto Leyva was looking at 
his sister while they dined at Topper's Pizza Place in south Oxnard on July 10, 
police said. The two exchanged words inside the restaurant, and police say 
Balderama shot Leyva moments later in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 A bullet pierced a major artery in Leyva's stomach, and Leyva, a father of 
two, died 10 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 Leyva's death fits another pattern: Ventura County killers are using handguns 
more often than they used to, reflecting the rise in handgun ownership in the 
United States, Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 28 homicides in 1994, 19 of the victims died in gunfire. That 70% 
proportion of the death toll tops the nationwide tally of 60% of homicide 
victims who are killed with bullets nationwide, according to a 1988 U.S. 
Department of Justice study. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all of the Ventura County gun deaths involved handguns. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the year's most tragic slayings occurred in Thousand Oaks on July 13, 
when a 17-year-old boy playing with his father's 9-millimeter, semiautomatic 
pistol shot his 16-year-old girlfriend in the eye.  
</P>
<P>
 Jacqueline Reay died in the incident. The boy, convicted as a juvenile, was 
sentenced to 10 1/2 years incarceration with the California Youth Authority. 
Authorities say he probably will serve time only until age 21. 
</P>
<P>
 In a case that diverges from the trend, another young victim died after being 
stabbed with a classmate's knife at a Simi Valley junior high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley View Junior High students Phillip Hernandez and Chad Hubbard had 
quarreled in the past, but the rivalry went over the edge Feb. 1, when Phillip 
stabbed Chad to death in front of dozens of classmates as school let out. 
Phillip, convicted of involuntary manslaughter, was sentenced to four years in 
the California Youth Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the killings of 1994 were so clear-cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Some cases were closed within minutes by reliable eyewitnesses who helped 
police and prosecutors win swift convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Some killers went to prison, some got away, and some are still awaiting their 
day in court. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other slayings remain mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
 And while one was a police shooting, most were crimes of anger, drunkenness, 
or as one veteran investigator put it, "irrational acts of stupidity." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the other Ventura County homicides of 1994: 
</P>
<P>
 * Roberto Ponce, 29, had beaten his girlfriend one too many times, Oxnard 
police said. When her 15-year-old son caught him lying on top of her Jan. 8 and 
preparing to strike her again, the youth picked up an ax handle and bludgeoned 
Ponce to death, police said. The district attorney decided not to file charges, 
ruling that the killing was justified. 
</P>
<P>
 * Thomas Shoop, 36, of Ventura died at home Feb. 20 after being violently 
kicked in the abdomen during a street robbery by Everado Mondragon, 35, and 
Jose Sanchez, 24. A judge ruled there was insufficient evidence to charge the 
two with homicide, but police and prosecutors say they believe the beating 
ruptured Shoop's spleen and killed him. 
</P>
<P>
 * On March 5, the day after his truck was found abandoned in West Hollywood, 
Andy Lee Anderson, 24, and his dog were found shot to death at a remote Rose 
Valley campground. Timothy Chrestman, 19, of Port Hueneme faces a Jan. 3 trial 
for murder, robbery and auto theft charges that could put him in prison for 
life, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Police are still trying to learn who shot 21-year-old Eric Velasquez in the 
torso. He was killed March 7 in the parking lot of a Santa Paula apartment 
building after smashing some car windows. But there is no evidence tying the 
car to any suspects, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 * On March 26, members of Oxnard's Surtown and Loma Flats gangs squared off in 
a Port Hueneme park, aimed handguns at each other and fired. Cesar Mata, 16, 
died, shot once in the chest. Prosecutors said they have declined to file 
charges because witnesses' conflicting stories left them without enough 
evidence to prove the case. 
</P>
<P>
 * A short, unhappy marriage left Mina and Jose Castaneda of Santa Paula on the 
edge of divorce, but they reconciled the day before she was to file the papers. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, on April 2, Jose Castaneda, 26, left a birthday party and 
robbed a motel with a friend, prosecutors said. When he returned, he found his 
25-year-old wife holding a baseball bat, angry because he had left the party. 
He shot her in the head during the ensuing argument, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaneda was sentenced to 45 years to life in prison for murder under the 
state's "three-strikes" law, invoked because he had two prior robbery 
convictions. He also received another 30 years for firearm-related charges. 
</P>

 * David Rubio, 19, borrowed a car from Donald Culbertson's sister in Oxnard on 
April 10, but returned it late. That led to an argument, and Culbertson, 24, 
stabbed Rubio to death in an alley. Culbertson pleaded guilty to murder and was 
sentenced to 19 years in prison for that and two assaults, a prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chased by police cruisers on April 25, Alfonso Bravo, 20, ditched the stolen 
Mustang he was driving and ran. Oxnard Police Officer Patrick Dolan, 29, chased 
Bravo over several fences. When he topped one wooden fence to find Bravo 
pointing a loaded 9-millimeter gun at him, Dolan dropped behind the fence and 
fired four shots through it, killing Bravo. The district attorney's office 
ruled the shooting was justified. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ventura janitor John Edward Rios Jr. braked his family company's van to a 
stop at a Ventura intersection April 26. A co-worker riding with him said that 
a dark-clad man in a ski mask walked in front of the van, drew close to the 
driver's side, pulled out a handgun and shot Rios through the window. Rios died 
three days later, and police are still frustrated by the lack of solid leads, 
Ventura Police Lt. Brad Talbot said. 
</P>
<P>
 * After refusing to turn down the volume of music at his house May 8, Ventura 
landscaper Juan Vargas, 31, was shot to death by a drunk, angry neighbor at the 
Victorian Trailer Park, police said. The suspect, Raul Cervantes Viveros, 46, 
is at large, and police say they have been talking with the Mexican consulate 
in case he left this country. 
</P>
<P>
 * May 8, several weeks after Gary Michael Rose, 24, moved into the Oxnard home 
of his former fiancee, Victoria Ramey, 31, he shot her to death. Rose 
surrendered to police and pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, but he was 
convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 20 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 * On May 12, Braulio Bojorquez, 25, a small-time El Rio dope dealer, was found 
trussed up with electrical cord and stabbed repeatedly in the head and back, 
authorities said. Ventura County sheriff's detectives said they suspect he 
crossed someone in the violent, statewide Sinaloa Cowboys gang, but they have 
found no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 * Navy plumber Thomas Shipley, 43, shot his wife, Linda, 40, in the chest May 
13 at their Oxnard home, then shot himself. A relative said the two "looked so 
much in love," but others told of Shipley's bad temper and his habit of yelling 
at neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Moises Galaviz, 41, stalked away from a drunken family argument near Santa 
Paula on May 30, returned with a gun and opened fire on his two brothers. 
Aurelio Galaviz was wounded, and Jose Galaviz, 35, died of a gunshot wound to 
his upper back. Judged mentally incompetent to stand trial, Moises Galaviz was 
sent to Patton State Psychiatric Hospital until he is able to face charges of 
murder and attempted murder, a prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Standing in a friend's kitchen in south Oxnard, someone fired through the 
window, shooting Ricardo Gonzales in the heart June 10. "There were absolutely 
no witnesses, nothing," says Oxnard Police Detective Mike Palmieri. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rodney McClain was found slumped in an alley June 25, a single gunshot wound 
in his side. The Oxnard postal worker, 40, died en route to the hospital. 
Police say they have witnesses and are still working to find a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 * Thomas Corral stormed into his ex-girlfriend's Ventura apartment on July 21 
and shot drifter Roger Rowland, 23, in the stomach once because he believed the 
two were dating, prosecutors have said. Corral faces a trial on murder charges 
Jan. 9 while a friend who accompanied him there, Ruben Viveros, 19, is serving 
prison time after pleading guilty to being an accessory to the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 * When Jesus Arredondo, 32, sent his friend out for beer Aug. 5, he asked for 
Budweiser. When Miguel Garabaldi, 39, returned, he brought Natural Light 
instead. Already drunk, the two quarreled and Garabaldi stabbed Arredondo in 
the stomach, a prosecutor said. Garabaldi faces a Jan. 17 murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 * Port Hueneme grocer Mohinder Bassi, 42, was fatally stabbed in the chest 
Aug. 10. His employee, Adolfo Carrillo, 32, is to be tried Jan. 17 for murder. 
</P>
<P>
 * As he stood outside an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting near Cabrillo Village, 
Jose Gutierrez, 37, was hit in the heart by stray gunfire from a gang fight. 
Rudolfo Martinez, 21, faces a pretrial hearing Jan. 5 on murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
 * On Oct. 22, avid Moorpark gun collector Patrick Dattile dialed 911 to say 
that his wife had been shot and was bleeding to death. In mid-call, the police 
dispatcher heard a pop, and when police arrived at their home, they found 
Dattile, 33, lying dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound beside the 
body of his wife, Mary Dattile, 30.  
</P>
<P>
 "He had a habit of playing with guns and he had been drinking," said Lt. Larry 
Robertson, head of the sheriff's Major Crimes Unit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Zolly Terry, 21, of Oxnard, faces a murder trial on Feb. 6. Prosecutors say 
he shot Jerome Hurst, 25, to death on Oct. 24 and tried to kill another man who 
was romantically linked to Terry's sister. 
</P>
<P>
 * Palmdale pipe layer Pedro Cervera, 28, was shot once in the head after a 
jealous man saw him and two fellow pipe layers talking with the man's 
girlfriend Oct. 25, prosecutors said. David Lopez, 39, of Santa Paula is to be 
arraigned for murder Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stephanie Case, 42, of Ventura was found lying dead along an abandoned 
stretch of Old Rincon Highway on Oct. 29. Heavily intoxicated, she had been 
fatally struck by a car. Investigators say they have no leads to determine who 
is responsible for her death. 
</P>
<P>
 * And in the latest homicide, 24-year-old Martin Jesus Hidalgo was fatally 
stabbed just before midnight on Dec. 22 at an apartment in north Oxnard. 
Occupants of the apartment told police that Hidalgo and another man were 
intruders at the apartment. Other details remain sketchy, and the police 
investigation continues.

RANCHERS VOW TO FIGHT A PROPOSED ORDINANCE TO LIMIT ANIMALS; LEGISLATION: 
PLANNERS WANT TO RESTRICT THE NUMBER OF COWS, HORSES AND OTHER CRITTERS ON 
LARGE LOTS. NO WAY, REPLY THE OWNERS OF THE COUNTY'S LARGEST EQUESTRIAN CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1990, Jamie and Kay Skeeters sank $2.3 million into a showplace ranch home 
and the largest equestrian center in the Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 They built an impressive barn, a riding ring and boarding facilities for as 
many as 120 horses, though only 80 are being kept this winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the look of prosperity at Ojai Valley Farms, the family -- and other 
ranchers like them throughout Ventura County -- are fearful their investment in 
a rural way of life may soon be worth a lot less. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because the county, in an effort to close loopholes in a decade-old 
ordinance, has proposed limiting the number of animals -- from ostriches to 
cows -- allowed on large parcels of land. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranchers say such a restriction would cut deeply into their business and hurt 
the county's reputation as friendly to horses. But county planners say the 
rules are needed to protect landowners from having a hog farm or feed lot move 
in next door. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by the political clout of the Ventura County Farm Bureau and the 
Ventura County Cattlemen's Assn., a group of ranchers has persuaded the Board 
of Supervisors to postpone voting on the issue until the spring. And they vow 
to fight the ordinance in court if it is approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aside from the fact that my whole life savings is in this place, it's a 
lifestyle now," said Kay Skeeters, one of the most vocal opponents. "And it's 
not one that could be easily altered or terminated." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the current rules, landowners in the county's unincorporated area may 
keep an unlimited number of animals if they have more than 10 acres of property 
zoned for farming, ranching or open space. 
</P>
<P>
 County planners say that the policy has created problems when businesses with 
large numbers of animals on relatively small tracts open near populated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, neighbors of a feed lot on Taylor Ranch -- which kept tens of 
thousands of cattle in pens -- complained of odors, flies, dust and ground 
water contamination, said county planner Carl Morehouse. The lot is now closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar problems arose with a feed lot in Somis and a dairy in El Rio. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To bolster their case for tighter restrictions, planners point to a man who 
kept 800 ostriches and emus on his Chatsworth estate in a gated residential 
community. After a storm of protest from neighbors, a Los Angeles County zoning 
panel in October ordered the fowl removed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would you want this kind of operation right next to your property?" Morehouse 
asked, holding up a newspaper article about neighborhood outrage over the 
ostrich farm. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we're trying to do is establish a limit where there currently is no 
limit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the furor over the current proposal, Morehouse said, is based on 
misinformation. While the new ordinance would not significantly change the 
rules for small landowners, many may be in violation of the current rules and 
not know it, he said. They would have a year to make changes or seek a special 
permit from the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the confusion, county planners last week asked the Board of 
Supervisors to postpone the issue until further meetings can be held with 
landowners and agricultural groups. The first workshop is scheduled for Jan. 4 
at the government center. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will give us more time to work with the representative groups," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Planners do not know exactly how many properties would be affected by the 
change. The loudest opposition has come from the Ojai Valley, but Morehouse 
said he has also received phone calls from landowners in the east end of the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Garrison, whose family owns a 40-acre ranch in Hidden Valley near Thousand 
Oaks, said she could sympathize with those opposed to the ordinance. But at the 
same time, she said, the limits do not seem unreasonable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would never have 174 horses on this amount of land. That's absurd," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most outspoken critics argue that the current rules should be left intact 
because feed lots and dairies no longer exist in the county. Such operations 
are not likely to return, they say, because there are no longer enough cattle 
in the county to support them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our position is, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it,' " said Jamie Skeeters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the ordinance would use a formula to determine the number of 
horses, cows and other animals allowed on land zoned for open space and 
agricultural use.  
</P>
<P>
 One animal unit -- the equivalent of a cow, a horse, an ostrich, two pigs, 
five sheep or 10 chickens -- could be kept on every 10,000 square feet of land. 
Forty-six animal units would be allowed on 10 acres, and 87 on 20 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 On ranches bigger than 10 acres, additional horses could be kept if a separate 
stall is provided for each animal, manure is removed daily and dirt lots are 
watered to keep dust down. Under those conditions, one horse would be allowed 
for every 7,000 square feet of land. That equates to 65 horses on 10 acres and 
124 horses on 20 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Landowners would have one year to comply with the ordinance or apply for a 
special permit that would have to be approved by the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Under those rules, the Skeeterses would be allowed to keep 74 horses and cows 
on their 12-acre property -- half the number they had in mind when building the 
ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Since learning of the county's plans, however, the couple have bought an 
adjoining 12 acres, which would give them the right to keep a total of 148 
horses and cows. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Kalish, owner of Rancho Royale near Ojai, said the proposed ordinance 
would force him to give up at least a dozen of the 130 horses he now boards or 
pay a $770 application fee for the permit.  
</P>
<P>
 Like many ranchers, Kalish sees the need for controls on animals kept in more 
populated areas, but believes exceptions should be made for rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had 500 horses here, nobody would complain," he said. "I'm surrounded by 
nothing in front of me, cattle behind me and goats and chickens on the other 
side." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past three years, the county Planning Department has received about 
1,000 complaints concerning animals in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 About a quarter of those complaints come from areas where horses were kept on 
a few acres of land. But it is a misconception, Morehouse said, that only new 
residents in rural areas take offense to flies, odor and dust. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Hansen, a 20-year resident of Oak View, can attest to that. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has suffered health problems and has been unable to use his back 
porch since a county ordinance was changed in 1983 allowing his neighbor to 
keep horses within 40 feet of his property. Previously, the law required a 
100-foot buffer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just so stinky and dirty," said Hansen, who has amassed a thick file of 
complaints and letters to the county over the years. "I want them to change it 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While the Skeeterses and Kalish would like to see the supervisors reject the 
proposed ordinance outright, others say they need more time to study its 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
 John Harvey, president of the 100-member Ventura County Cattlemen's Assn., 
said he wants to know more about how the ordinance would deal with special 
cases, such as youth raising livestock over several years as 4-H projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "They kind of tried to force it down us in a hurry and we haven't had a chance 
to really look at it," he said. "I want to read the 200-plus-page proposal and 
see what they're asking us to do."

 When Concepcion Carino wakes up in the middle of the night, it is to the sound 
of her own voice, screaming for her mother.  
</P>
<P>
 But her mother is in Mexico, thousands of miles away. She can't soothe Carino, 
22, when her back aches. She can't rejoice to feel the baby kick in the womb or 
listen to Carino confide her hopes and fears for the child due this week. 
</P>
<P>
 So until a church volunteer handed the young Ventura woman a public health 
services flyer, Carino felt as if she was going it alone. Sure, she could talk 
to her boyfriend, the father of the child, whom she lives with, or her brother 
up in Santa Barbara. "But even if your (boyfriend's) there," she explained, 
"you feel more comfortable with your mother."  
</P>
<P>
 The flyer informed Carino of a "baby shower" held, free of charge, the third 
Thursday of each month at the Ventura Avenue Adult/Senior Center for pregnant 
women who are poor, alone or wish they knew more about caring for infants. 
</P>
<P>
 At the party, sponsored by the county public health department, the women 
could make crafts for their homes, participate in a drawing for stuffed animals 
and attend an educational session related to pregnancy or child care.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dec. 15 shower was Carino's third. Women are urged to attend throughout 
their pregnancy and until their infant is 3 months old. 
</P>
<P>
 The young woman says she now feels more in control. One month, a speaker 
explained how to tell what a baby wants by listening to the way it wails. 
Another time, she learned to massage an infant's legs to calm it when it has 
colic. On Dec. 15, an energetic "wellness coordinator" from the Pierpont 
Racquetball Club showed the women exercises to do during pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know this before," Carino said. "But here, I learned." 
</P>
<P>
 Carino also unknowingly tapped into a wellspring of resources -- a public 
health nurse, a community services worker and a marriage and family therapist, 
each of whom can follow up the shower with free counseling sessions and phone 
calls. The program has been such a success that the organizers have started two 
monthly showers in Oxnard, one in La Colonia and another on the city's 
southside, near Port Hueneme.  
</P>
<P>
 "We track the women afterwards," said Linda Underwood, the public health 
nurse. "We make home visits. We try to provide a listening ear." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the Ventura shower, the organizers separated the women into two groups -- 
those who speak Spanish and those who speak English. By the entrance, Carino 
and the other Spanish speakers stood in a circle on rubber mats, giggling as 
they moved to the wellness instructor's commands, pop music blaring in the 
background. 
</P>
<P>
 Next to the windows, the English speakers sat at a U-shaped table, gluing 
clothespins into Christmas tree ornaments and creating candlestick holders from 
candy canes and cellophane. 
</P>
<P>
 Brenda Coleman said she would hang the reindeer on her tree if someone would 
show her how to string the gold cord through the clothespins. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman, 33, is expecting her second baby in February. This is her first 
"normal" pregnancy, she explained, because she was too addicted to drugs and 
alcohol while pregnant with her first baby to notice the changes in her body. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman, who attends community college, was worried about having enough time 
for two children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a lot of reservations about having this child," said Coleman, who said 
she has been sober since 1992. "But I'm doing OK -- better than I thought I 
would." 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman said she likes coming to the showers because she can chat with other 
pregnant women about breast feeding or commiserate about having feet so swollen 
they barely even fit into tennis shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 She also relishes the escape. "It's nice not to be doing anything I have to be 
doing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd at the December shower numbered about 25. A handful of the 
participants were teen-agers -- two cousins, one 14 and one 15; an 18-year-old 
from a small town near Bakersfield who lives at a Ventura home for unwed 
mothers because her parents, she says, "are having a hard time dealing with 
it," and two other teen-age housemates who also live at the Ventura home. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of the adults, some are married, some aren't. Some are expecting their first 
child. For others, this will be their second or third. As morning turned into 
afternoon, the room filled with their chatter and the squealing of small 
children, along for the event because no baby sitter could be found. 
</P>
<P>
 Carino labored over her reindeer and candlestick holders. When done, she would 
put them in places of honor at home, next to the crafts she made at earlier 
sessions, in spots where visitors could see them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time I've ever done crafts," she said, her mouth curling into 
a shy smile. "I really enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she remains a little nervous about the impending birth, but mostly 
she's fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother's not here to help me through, so I'm being strong for myself," she 
said. "If you are not strong for yourself, then you get scared."

APARTMENT COMPLEX IS MORE THAN A PLACE TO STAY; THOUSAND OAKS: FIORE GARDENS 
PROJECT OFFERS FAMILIES ANY -- AND ALL KINDS OF -- HELP NEEDED TO MAKE THE MOVE 
OUT OF PUBLIC HOUSING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It looks like a great deal: a brand-new, three-bedroom apartment stacked with 
modern appliances that rents for just 30% of your income -- no matter how low 
your income may be. 
</P>
<P>
 There's just one catch. As soon as you move in, you must start preparing to 
move out. 
</P>
<P>
 With that novel rule, managers of the Area Housing Authority hope to 
kick-start an experiment that could change the nature of public housing in 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 They want to transform public housing from a dead-end destination, where poor 
families languish for years, to a hope-filled way station, where people can 
learn the skills they need to advance. 
</P>
<P>
 The experiment, called Family Self-Sufficiency, will begin in Fiore Gardens, a 
50-unit apartment complex for low-income families under construction in 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Named for former Thousand Oaks City Councilman Alex Fiore, the Spanish-style 
development stretches along Hillcrest Drive west of Hodencamp Road. The city is 
leasing the five-acre parcel to the Area Housing Authority for $1 a year, and 
has kicked in $230,000 to upgrade the project with landscaping, red-tile roofs 
and wrought-iron gates. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how classy the development looks, however, Fiore Gardens remains 
public housing. And thus, officials said, it's automatically ripe for reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want (Fiore Gardens) to be a permanent, rest-of-your-life 
residence," said David Roddick, director of housing management for the Area 
Housing Authority. "We want to create an atmosphere where we're helping you to 
move on with your life." 
</P>
<P>
 To emphasize that point, the Area Housing Authority will impose a five-year 
limit on each family's stay in Fiore Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 During those five years, housing officials will teach workshops on budgeting, 
finding jobs, raising children and other topics deemed essential for 
"self-sufficiency." They will also offer intensive individual counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants must pledge to attend the classes -- and abide by the five-year limit 
-- in their lease agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not talking about boot camp," Roddick said. "(But) I feel I have a 
fiduciary responsibility to the taxpayer of the United States" to wean tenants 
from federal handouts as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, a Fiore Gardens computer lab will offer software to help 
residents obtain their high school equivalency degrees or pursue advanced 
studies. A jobs counselor will guide adults toward potential employment. And 
housing officials will set up trust accounts so families can accumulate savings 
when their incomes rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're making an effort to give them a comprehensive service program, as 
opposed to just a box to live in," Roddick said. "We need to provide the 
resources, and they need to put out the effort." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which covered the 
$4.2-million cost of building Fiore Gardens, has encouraged local agencies to 
develop self-sufficiency programs for tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 But the federal government does not require such programs as a condition of 
funding -- at least, not yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like somebody from inside the Beltway sent down an edict saying 'You 
must do this,' " Roddick explained. "This has been a staff-developed idea. But 
we feel sure this is the direction that public housing across America will go." 
</P>
<P>
 As a trial run for the program, local housing officials began last year to 
counsel several dozen people who rely on federal vouchers to pay for shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 The approach worked wonders for Maria Gomez, a single mother of three, who 
rents a subsidized home in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Self-sufficiency coordinator Mary K. James steered Gomez toward classes at 
Oxnard College, and encouraged her to pursue a dream of working with 
developmentally disabled children. Now, Gomez has picked up a $14-an-hour job 
as an administrative assistant for the Early Start program, which serves 
infants with special needs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, Gomez said she has learned to set goals that will help lift 
her off federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doors are opening up for me now," Gomez said. "I know I can make more money. 
I'm really, really excited." 
</P>
<P>
 James hopes to bring the same personal attention and steady encouragement to 
her work with the 50 families who will move into Fiore Gardens next fall. And 
she expects to do all sorts of odd jobs as she clears away obstacles for her 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
 If a tenant's car breaks down, she will drive him to work -- and beg local 
mechanics for cheap repairs. If mothers complain about the rigors of 
child-rearing, she will set up a support group for single parents. If a family 
trashes a rented apartment, she will arrange classes in proper home 
maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even the small triumphs are fantastic," James said. 
</P>
<P>
 For all their high hopes, Area Housing Authority officials acknowledge that 
counseling will not be enough to lift the poorest families off welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County's rents are so high that many low-income families find it 
impossible to move into market-rate apartments, even when their salaries jump a 
bit. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Thousand Oaks may help out with low-interest loans and 
down-payment aid. But housing officials predict that many families will still 
require some form of subsidy -- most likely a Section 8 housing voucher -- 
after leaving Fiore Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, they say Family Self-Sufficiency is worth a try. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of this growing trend of improving government assistance to be sure 
we're providing not just money, but a means to move on," Thousand Oaks Mayor 
Jaime Zukowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's housing services manager, Olav Hassel, added: "It's going to be a 
struggle for (tenants) to get the skills to better their incomes . . . but I 
think there undoubtedly will be some success stories."

<P>
 Drunk driving arrests over the Christmas weekend were down slightly from 
previous years, the California Highway Patrol reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 During a maximum-enforcement period from 6 p.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Monday, 21 
people in Ventura County were arrested on suspicion of driving under the 
influence of alcohol, the Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
 During a similar period in 1992, there were 24 arrests, and in 1990, there 
were 43 arrests. Last year's figures were not available Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Accidents attributed to drunk drivers were also down this year, with only two 
minor accidents reported through Monday. During the holiday weekend in 1990 two 
people were killed in accidents involving alcohol. MATTHEW MOSK

OPENING DAY IS MIXED FOR VALENZUELAS; HORSE RACING: FERNANDO SUFFERS SERIOUS 
BACK INJURY; PAT WINS MALIBU. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The riding Valenzuela cousins had a contrasting day as Santa Anita opened its 
58th season Monday, Pat riding Powis Castle to an unexpected victory in the 
$109,300 Malibu Stakes after Fernando suffered a serious back injury in a spill 
during the first race. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of heavy traffic, not all of the crowd of 46,904 saw the accident, 
which also resulted in the death of one horse and minor injuries to two other 
jockeys. 
</P>
<P>
 When Snowy River Miss' right foreleg snapped on the far turn, the 3-year-old 
filly and her rider, Fernando Valenzuela, went down. Chris McCarron and Paul 
Atkinson, attempting to avoid Snowy River Miss, were also unseated. Valenzuela 
and McCarron left the track in an ambulance. X-rays showed that Valenzuela 
suffered two compression fractures of vertebrae, while McCarron escaped with 
bruised ribs. Atkinson, who suffered cuts and bruises, rode one more race, but 
complained of dizziness and was excused from his remaining mounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela, who finished eighth in the Santa Anita standings last season, is 
expected to be sidelined for six to eight weeks. Snowy River Miss was 
destroyed, but the other two horses, who continued around the course, were 
apparently uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
 Shiny Slew, who won the race, was disqualified by the stewards for coming over 
on Snowy River Miss and Hawks Fly Hi going into the far turn. The interference 
was not believed to be related to Snowy River Miss' breakdown. Hawks Fly Hi 
became the winner of the race, and Shiny Slew was placed last. Abe Santos, one 
of the owners of Shiny Slew, said his group would appeal the stewards' decision 
to the California Horse Racing Board. 
</P>
<P>
 So on a day when staying out of trouble was not the easiest of tasks, Pat 
Valenzuela found room for Powis Castle on the rail leaving the stretch turn, 
and they beat favored Ferrara by a half-length in the seven-furlong Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 "My instructions to Pat before the race were just not to fall off," said 
trainer Rodney Rash, who had spent most of the year in frustration, trying to 
win distance races with Powis Castle -- including the Kentucky Derby. Powis 
Castle, eighth in the roughly run Derby and ninth in the Preakness, had won 
only one of nine 1994 starts before Monday. The last time he ran at a distance 
less than a mile, last December, he won a minor stake at Turfway Park and was 
bought after the race by Berry Gordy, founder of Motown Records. 
</P>
<P>
 "We bought him as a Triple Crown candidate," Rash said. "But he's built and 
trains like a sprinter. We thought all along that he might be a sprinter, but 
he made more than $250,000 stretching out. It looks like we'll keep sprinting 
him now." 
</P>
<P>
 Powis Castle earned $64,300 Monday, paying $17.60 to win and reaching the wire 
in 1:20 4/5, which was four-fifths of a second slower than the track record set 
by Spectacular Bid in the 1980 Malibu. With Pat Valenzuela a pound overweight, 
Powis Castle carried 117 pounds, one more than Ferrara and three less than the 
high-weighted College Town, who finished fourth in the eight-horse field. 
Numerous ran third, five lengths behind Ferrara, who set demanding opening 
splits of :22 2/5 and :44 4/5. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela was a change for Powis Castle, who had been ridden by several other 
jockeys, including Gary Stevens, who was aboard for the colt's only 1994 
victory, in a division of the Oceanside on grass at Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've got the right jockey for what we want to accomplish with the 
horse next year," said Roger Campbell, who manages Vistas Stables for Gordy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrara, ridden by Chris Antley, shook off Uncaged Fury and I'ma Game Master, 
who battled him for the early lead. Ferrara didn't weaken even though Powis 
Castle slipped past him at the top of the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boy, he ran game," Antley said. "That other horse got by me, and my horse 
tried to come back on again. I just couldn't overhaul him in the last part. I 
rode Powis Castle in the Kentucky Derby, and I definitely think his best 
distance is seven-eighths to a mile. He showed himself today." 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela was introduced to Powis Castle in two sharp workouts recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "He come home great both times," Valenzuela said. "He came home great today 
too, and I knew I could outfinish the horse on the lead. I never even had to 
hit him. Halfway around the turn, Chris Antley was worried about horses outside 
of him, so I was able to take advantage. We went to the inside and snuck up on 
him. I don't know if this horse is strictly a sprinter. Could be." 
</P>
<P>

NOT MAPPED OUT; THOMAS BROTHERS TAKE BIZARRE ROUTE TO COTTON BOWL-BOUND TEXAS 
TECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Their home is in the Panhandle about a three-hour drive to the northeast in an 
unincorporated area outside Pampa, the big city, and White Deer, a plot of land 
so isolated that as kids they would play in the snow in their underwear without 
fear of being seen by neighbors. So remote that, as Spike Dykes, their football 
coach at Texas Tech, says, "You gotta be wantin' to go there to get there." 
</P>
<P>
 So Lubbock is a huge metropolis to the Thomas brothers. No wonder. It's the 
cotton capital of Texas and home to about 187,000 people. And then there's the 
graffiti on one of the windows of the Industrial- Mechanical Engineering 
building on campus -- someone wrote "Hi YA'LL!" in the dust. 
</P>
<P>
 Perspective is everything in this case. But have the Thomases hit the big time 
here? That is not up for debate, not after free safety Bart and linebacker Zach 
became the first brothers to be consensus All-Southwest Conference picks in the 
80-year history of the league. Not after Zach, a junior, was named first-team 
All-American by UPI and the American Football Coaches Assn. and the SWC 
defensive player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 To think that neither is supposed to be in this town, at least not to play 
football, or on this level. And certainly not preparing for this game, the Jan. 
2 Cotton Bowl against USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Bart should be finishing, or have already completed, his career as an option 
quarterback at Air Force, preparing for his ultimate goal to be a fighter 
pilot. Either that or wondering what could have been after retiring before last 
season to concentrate on school and helping his wife raise their infant 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Zach probably should have used up his eligibility at some junior college and 
then gone to that final resting place for all slow-footed, undersized 
linebackers. Division II. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the small-town brothers are going big city. They are going to Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No one is surprised that Bart Thomas succeeded. He has always been the natural 
athlete -- all-state as a quarterback and defensive back on the team that won 
the Texas 2A championship, basketball MVP for his district, record-setter in 
the pole vault for his division. For good measure, he'll stand flat footed and 
turn a few back flips. 
</P>
<P>
 The twist is that it happened here. Coming out of high school in White Deer 
(population: 1,110), he considered Air Force, Arizona and Texas before deciding 
on the academy and the desire to fly jets. Texas Tech was never really in the 
picture, and never pushed hard, because the Red Raiders wanted him as a 
defensive back and Bart made it clear to everyone he wanted to play 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter fate. During a pickup game at Air Force with some of his college 
teammates in waiting, before he even got to two-a-days, Bart planted his right 
leg to make a cut and tore his anterior cruciate ligament. He had not enrolled 
in classes yet, so the clock on his eligibility had not started and school 
officials wanted him to attend a prep school rather than miss the first 
semester of his freshman year because of the surgery and rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bart decided against that, effectively making him a free agent again. 
Concerned about the serious injury, every school that had interest in him 
before backed off except Texas Tech, still promising nothing more than 
defensive back, and Arizona, still offering quarterback. Dykes was the first 
coach to call him in the hospital, and that stuck with the patient/prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had faith in me," Bart said. "I was lucky for that. Coach Dykes, I 
realized how good a guy he was after that deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dykes: "Recruiting is nothing but feel anyway. There's a few players 
around that are great players and everybody knows them. There's the blue-chip 
guys, the Tony Bosellis (of USC), coming out of high school that you know are 
going to be great players. The majority of the people playing are the guys that 
you don't know whether they'll make it or not anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 If it was a gamble for the Red Raiders, the payoff started to be realized in 
1991, when Thomas played a prominent role on special teams. The next season, 
when Zach arrived, Bart became the starting strong safety in the second game 
and held it most of the rest of the way, finishing as the team's fifth-leading 
tackler. He was moved to free safety in the spring and was the projected 
starter for 1993. That's when daughter Taylor was born, on May 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The responsibilities of fatherhood quickly became overwhelming, and Bart 
started to think in the summer about quitting football to devote the extra time 
to the family. He decided to wait until two-a-days before making a decision. It 
took one day of fall practice to determine that his interest in the game had 
waned, so he quit. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, he thought he had permanently retired. He took a heavy load of 
classes. He helped his wife, Jill, raise Taylor. He watched the home games in 
person and the road games on television. He was miserable. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had regrets," Zach said. "I know he missed it big time my sophomore year, 
when we went to the (John Hancock Bowl). He watched all the games and it was 
like, 'Gosh, I wish I was out there.' " 
</P>
<P>
 With Jill's encouragement, Bart returned for 1994, for one last season. One 
more chance to be teammates with his brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Rejuvenated by the year away, Bart, now a 23-year-old senior, started every 
game at free safety, led the Red Raiders with six interceptions and finished 
fourth in tackles. Zach was No. 2 in interceptions and No. 1 in tackles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bart was the No. 1 reason I came here," Zach said. "We could play together, 
just like high school. That's what I wanted. It was a dream. Now I can't 
believe we both make all-conference." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Zach Thomas succeeding here, now that's a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 He has spent most of his life trying to prove people wrong, and that has been 
the motivation to excel. He was the chunky kid in junior high who got picked on 
a lot. He wanted to play varsity as a freshman at White Deer, and did. People 
said that was because it was a small school. He wanted to go to a bigger school 
for better competition, more baseball and more class choices, so he transferred 
to a 4A school in Pampa (population: 20,000). People there said he was in over 
his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he starred at the big school, and people still said he was too small at 
5-11 3/4 -- "When they measure my height I try to put a lot of socks on," he 
says -- and too slow. Texas and Texas A&M both said he didn't size up, 
literally, so the college decision came down to Texas Tech and Oklahoma State. 
Tech was closer to home and had Bart. No contest. 
</P>
<P>
 As a freshman, he came on in the second half of the season to reach second 
string at inside linebacker. In 1993, with Bart on sabbatical, Zach finished 
fourth in the SWC in tackles. As a junior, he took off. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone saw this coming, right? 
</P>
<P>
 "People would say, 'You look 5-10, you look like you have pedestrian speed, 
you can't get to the play,' " Zach said. "Hey, they don't say that any more." 
</P>
<P>
 Said younger sister Katina, a freshman at Tech: "When he reads the papers or 
the media guides and it says, 'Zach Thomas: pedestrian speed,' he'll just put 
it down like he didn't read it. But I can see right through him. It drives him. 
It's like, that's what people think and he'll show them." 
</P>
<P>
 That's why he was running late to eighth-grade graduation -- he had just 
remembered an all-night party would follow and he needed to lift weights now, 
even while wearing the Sunday suit, because the chance probably wouldn't come 
later. That's why he would get so mad in high school after striking out in 
baseball that he would bite his hand hard enough to leave temporary marks 
between the thumb and index finger. And why the star at Pampa loved to be on 
kickoff coverage in the state championship game, and why Texas Tech gave a 
scholarship to someone too small and too slow. 
</P>
<P>
 "What really impressed me about ol' Zach is that he was on all the special 
teams," Dykes said. "He's a senior, the best player on the team, starting 
fullback, starting linebacker -- and all the special teams. I just watched him 
play that night, and he played hurt with a sprained ankle and was a fierce 
competitor. Shoot, that's the kind of guys that make good players. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's probably not as tall as some people would like him. But he'll play pro 
ball the same way. He won't be supposed to and he'll be out there playing, 
because he's just a good player." 
</P>
<P>
 Because he, like brother Bart on a different path, was wantin' to get there.

CEBALLOS ESCAPES SHADOW OF SUNS; LAKER FORWARD STEPS INTO SPOTLIGHT AFTER 
SERVING AS BACKUP IN PHOENIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Cedric? 
</P>
<P>
 A butler can be Cedric. An English actor can be Cedric. But an NBA star? Not 
likely. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does it help if you're a 6-foot-3 forward in high school with ribs poking 
out of a skinny chest and you'll never get past 6-7 in an era when point guards 
come that tall. You might have dreamed the dream growing up in Compton, 
pretending to be Magic Johnson or Norm Nixon but in real life you're almost off 
the board. 
</P>
<P>
 That's Cedric Ceballos, the basketball star from left field. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Lakers' leading scorer with numbers -- 22 points a game, 50% shooting 
from the floor, nine rebounds -- that might make him an all-star, he was once a 
skinny sub at Dominguez High, unremarkable, unnoticed and unrecruited. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, maybe not completely unrecruited. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I got a letter from Walla Walla, Wash.," Ceballos said. "That was 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't make the varsity until my junior year in high school. I didn't play 
much until one of the starters got hurt. I just blossomed afterward. I was just 
an OK player, not really too flashy." 
</P>
<P>
 After two more productive years at Ventura College, he still didn't get to 
choose between UCLA and UNLV. He went to Cal State Fullerton, still thinking of 
himself as a student-athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thought I'd play two years of basketball, graduate and get on with my 
life," he said. "I didn't have any intention of playing in the NBA. Then at the 
end of my senior year, pro scouts started coming to our games. That's when I 
really started thinking about it. I thought, 'If I'm drafted, I'll try it for a 
year.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But all the while, Ceballos recalled a lesson learned from his junior college 
coach, Phil Mathews. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ceballos: "He ingrained in me, and I carry it still, a philosophy: Play 
hard, play hard all the time; if you're not going to play hard, sit down." 
</P>
<P>
 Ceballos worked hard, all right, with a game appropriate for an afterthought. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't wait for the ball to be brought to him while his teammates cleared a 
side. He went away from the ball and dashed here and there tirelessly, hoping 
to free himself near the basket and that whoever had the ball noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 He led the Big West in scoring twice and was among the nation's top 10 
rebounders as a senior. Still a long shot at his size, the Phoenix Suns got him 
with the 11th pick of the second round in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, the gruff, garrulous coach, Cotton Fitzsimmons, had a front-office 
job waiting for him and worked that way, playing whom he wanted when he wanted. 
Young Cedric wouldn't be trapped behind No. 1 picks with guaranteed contracts; 
he'd get a shot, if he earned it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played good in the summer league but that was just summer league," Ceballos 
said. "When the season started, it was back to reality. I sat there and watched 
other players play, just learning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The great thing about Cotton, he'd just throw you in, play you the whole 
game. The bad thing was, no matter what you did, you might not play the next 
five games. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he was great for me. He always got on me. I don't think rookies have a 
rookie year now but I had one with him. He made me carry the bags, yelled at me 
on every play, never gave me a call in practice. Any discretion he had between 
me and a player with years, the player with years got the call. He showed me 
how hard I'd have to work just to get respect in practice, much less games." 
</P>
<P>
 Developing slowly, Ceballos was averaging 13 points a game by his third season 
and won the slam-dunk contest with his famous blindfold jam, though skeptics 
claimed he could really see. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns reached the NBA finals but without him; he had broken a bone in his 
left foot in the Western Conference finals. With flashy Richard Dumas in his 
place, the Suns took the Chicago Bulls to six games before losing. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, with Dumas back in drug rehab and Charles Barkley hurt, Ceballos 
scored 40 points twice, 30 seven times and in one seven-game stretch averaged 
31.8. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, he averaged 19 points and 6.5 rebounds -- in 30 minutes a game -- and 
found himself on the trading block. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns had hit the jackpot with free agents Danny Manning and Wayman 
Tisdale, needed room under the salary cap and suspected that Ceballos, growing 
ever more restive, wouldn't like fighting for minutes as the third forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Voila! Jerry West got Ceballos for a No. 1 pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceballos complained of not having been "respected and appreciated" by the Suns 
but after he took off with the Lakers, discovered the big picture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't getting frustrated. . . ." he began. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh man, all you ever talked about was how they wouldn't play you!" 
interjected Laker teammate Tony Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't really complaining," said Ceballos, beginning again, "but no matter 
what you did, you knew you were expendable. You weren't going to take over for 
Barkley, KJ (Kevin Johnson). With Charles and Kevin, I'd be camped out at the 
three-point line, pointing at the referee to get my man legal, buying me a 
ticket and watching.  
</P>
<P>
 "But they treated me right. I didn't have a no-trade contract but they came to 
me. I had a couple options but the light was kind of shining in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it was intermittent at first as Coach Del Harris learned how to use a 
20-point scorer he calls a "slipping, sliding, sneaking, hiding sort of a 
ballplayer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell you," Harris said, "I don't know how many points he's scored. Let's 
see, 20 points a game for 20 games -- as a coach I can probably take credit for 
running some good offense that got him 10 of them and he got the other 390. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the way we use him, ironically, we don't use him much different 
than Phoenix did. I have found he has such a unique ability to get open -- he 
gets open more when I call a play for another player. He's a very difficult guy 
to set a game plan against. You couldn't say, when they run play 50, we're 
gonna trap or we're gonna switch. Because they didn't have anything for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like Dennis Rodman. How do you play him? I mean, he's in the game, he's 
part of your game plan. You can say, 'Well, block out Rodman.' But you can't. 
Cedric's the same way. You say, 'Try to keep Cedric from scoring. I don't know 
how exactly you do that but keep track of him, keep your body on him.' 
</P>
<P>
 "But everybody's geared to helping out on defense. Soon as you help out -- 
where'd he go?" 
</P>
<P>
 A career 52% shooter, Ceballos shot 43% in his first nine games; since he's at 
54%. 
</P>
<P>
 The garbage man the Suns told to stay around the basket is moving out on the 
floor. Ceballos tried 23 three-point shots in four seasons in Phoenix, making 
two. This season, he's taking one a game, making a respectable 36%. 
</P>
<P>
 If he always looked like a star -- Ceballos dresses expensively, dabbles in 
the music business as a singer/songwriter, is single, likes to mingle -- he's 
becoming the real thing. "That's always a dream, a fantasy," he said. "Having 
your own commercial, having your own shoes. Being like Mike. Everybody wants to 
be Mike now and then." 
</P>
<P>
 And not being afraid to let it out, either. Ceballos has begun noting his 
contributions to victories and wondering out loud where his shots and/or 
minutes went in losses. "Well, that's all right," Harris said. "He's such a 
competitor." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, he became the first Laker to score 50 points since Gail Goodrich in 
1975. The first call he got was from Barkley, congratulating him and telling 
him not to expect to get that many in the America West Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 If there's something familiar about it, it's because Ceballos dreamed it as a 
skinny kid, before he became the NBA's one and only Cedric, 25 and sneaking up 
on stardom, at last.

OAKLEY WILL UNDERGO TOE SURGERY TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forward Charles Oakley will undergo surgery today for a partially dislocated 
toe, sidelining him for at least six weeks, the New York Knicks said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakley decided on surgery Sunday night after the Knicks lost their fifth game 
in a row, 107-104, to the Bulls at Chicago.He had tried playing with a special 
shoe but it didn't help. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just too much," he said. "I really can't get any lift. I might as well 
do it now so it doesn't affect the whole year. . . . We're just wasting time." 
</P>
<P>
 The injury is to the second toe on Oakley's right foot, and the special shoe 
caused him to sprain his ankle slightly several times after he returned to the 
lineup Thursday, Oakley said.

SHELL SEEKS TO RETURN TO RAIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Will Art Shell be back as head coach of the Raiders? 
</P>
<P>
 He wants to return for a seventh season, but he knows the decision is not his. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't worry about that," he said. "There's an evaluation process. I get 
evaluated just like everybody else. I get evaluated. I evaluate my staff. If 
there's a need for a change here, then that's out of my hands. I have no 
control over that, but I don't worry about it." 
</P>
<P>
 There has been speculation that owner Al Davis will make a change after a 
Raider team that Shell considered the best he has coached failed to qualify for 
the playoffs, losing in the regular-season finale Saturday to the Kansas City 
Chiefs. But there is also a feeling that Davis would not want to bring in a 
coach with whom he would not have the rapport and opportunity for input that he 
enjoys with Shell. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raider coach watched the Kansas City game film in agony on Christmas Eve, 
again on Christmas Day and again Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a devastating finish to a promising season, but it didn't dim Shell's 
enthusiasm for his profession. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love this business," he said. "I love this job. . . . I've grown every year 
I've been in the job. I believe I'm a better coach having gone through some of 
the experiences I've gone through. (I've) been at every level of the playoffs 
except the one big one, which is the Super Bowl. That's my drive. That's my 
dream, to be able to coach a team in one, win the doggone thing and move on. 
And that drive has not changed." 
</P>
<P>
 While Shell said the Raiders will take a look at the free-agent market, he 
doesn't want to lose any of the players he has. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll try to sign all of our guys," he said. "We've always done that. There's 
nobody on this team that we would not want back here."

 Tom Flores' future as coach and general manager of the Seattle Seahawks will 
be decided later this week when he meets with majority owner Ken Behring. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores, 57, refused on Monday to speculate on what Behring might do.Based on 
Behring's public comments about the Seahawks' 6-10 record and a meeting the 
owner had this month with Bill Walsh, the Seattle media is indicating Flores is 
finished. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, it probably is," Flores replied when asked if his job was in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 In three seasons, Flores is 14-34, including a 4-20 record and three 
last-place finishes in the AFC West. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores said his meeting with Behring, a land developer, will take place in 
Behring's Blackhawk development in Danville, Calif. He wouldn't say when they'd 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's within the next day or two," Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores said he is scheduled to meet with his assistants, including offensive 
coordinator Larry Kennan and defensive coordinator Rusty Tillman, at team 
headquarters Thursday morning to tell them about their job future. The 
contracts of all 12 assistants are up.

 The Cincinnati Bengals fired special teams coach Marv Braden but indicated 
there would be no other substantive changes in a team that finished 3-13 for 
the third time in four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Special teams play directly cost the team two games this season. The Bengals 
allowed two punt returns and a kickoff return for touchdowns and had a punt 
blocked in the end zone for a touchdown.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; BARRY SANDERS IS UNANIMOUS ALL-PRO 
PICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barry Sanders became the first player since 1987 to make the Associated Press 
All-Pro team as a unanimous selection, while Steve Young barely missed that 
distinction. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders made a sweep of the voting by a nationwide panel of 98 sportswriters 
and broadcasters. The Detroit Lion running back, who led the NFL with 1,883 
yards rushing and scored eight touchdowns, was the first unanimous selection 
since Jerry Rice of the San Francisco 49ers in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Young got 96 votes at quarterback, with Miami's Dan Marino the choice of the 
other two voters. The 49ers' Young, having his best season, led the league in 
passing for the fourth consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Sanders in the backfield was Dallas' Emmitt Smith, who led the league 
with 22 touchdowns, tied for third in league history. Smith, the 1993 league 
MVP, received 93 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Raiders made the second team: cornerback Terry McDaniel, defensive 
tackle Chester McGlockton and offensive guard Steve Wisniewski. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice made the team for the eighth time since 1986. Like Young, he had his most 
prolific season and collected 94 votes. That was six more than the next 
receiver, Cris Carter of Minnesota, who set an NFL record for receptions this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Another record-setter, Ben Coates of New England, was the tight end, getting 
88 votes. Coates established a single-season mark for catches by a tight end 
with 96. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Sanders was the leading vote-getter on defense, 49er cornerback Deion 
Sanders receiving 86 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh's Rod Woodson, the 1993 defensive player of the year, was the other 
cornerback, one of four Steelers on the squad. Another Woodson, Dallas safety 
Darren, was selected, along with Cleveland's Eric Turner from UCLA at the other 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Ram linebacker Kevin Greene, now a Steeler, made the team for the first 
time. 
</P>

LONG BEACH STATE NOTEBOOK / JASON REID; 49ERS COUNTING ON DEPENDABLE ATKINSON 
TO LEAD THEM IN TOUGH SPOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With about six minutes to play Wednesday against Montana, Long Beach forward 
Mike Atkinson committed his fourth foul. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers had a seven-point lead and were playing at The Pyramid, so Coach 
Seth Greenberg could have followed the safe, textbook scenario: take Atkinson 
out of the game for a few minutes to prevent him from fouling out with the 
outcome still undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Greenberg played the risky hand -- and won. 
</P>
<P>
 Atkinson stayed in the game, made big plays down the stretch and scored a 
game-high 19 points in leading the 49ers to a 79-69 nonconference victory. No 
matter the circumstances, Greenberg knows he can rely on Atkinson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike is our anchor in the front court," Greenberg said. "He knows what we 
want to do. He makes everything work up front." 
</P>
<P>
 Atkinson, 6 feet 7 and 235 pounds, leads the 49ers in scoring at 15.5 points 
per game. He averages four rebounds. Greenberg has many players new to the 
program, and Atkinson is a steadying force for the 49ers (3-1). 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to provide some leadership," Atkinson said. "We've got a lot of new 
guys and they're trying to learn their roles." 
</P>
<P>
 Atkinson's role is to score and play tough defense, both of which he does 
well. He's one of the better players in the nation around the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 He led the nation in field-goal percentage last season at 69.5%, making 141 of 
203 of his shots. He averaged 15.4 points and four rebounds and was selected 
second-team All-Big West Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I shoot most of my shots only a few feet away (from the basket), so they 
better go in," Atkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Having received a degree in criminal justice after last season, Atkinson is 
currently working on a master's degree in the same field. He hopes to become a 
secret service agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good way to make a living and raise a family," Atkinson said. "They 
like athletes for the protection work because of all the running and physical 
things involved." 
</P>
<P>
 And if some team wants Atkinson to play for pay? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll go play in Europe or somewhere else in a minute," Atkinson said. "But if 
that call doesn't come, I'll have something really good to fall back on." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, new faces: Because of final exams, Long Beach didn't play for 15 days 
after being upset, 64-58, by Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Atkinson said practice during the time off was especially difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were banging on each other so much," he said. "We were all really angry 
after the Northridge game, and we went at it in practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were all glad when the Montana game finally came. And it also felt good to 
get a win." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Big Joe on the go: Senior center Joe McNaull, a transfer from San Diego State, 
is starting to assert himself. 
</P>
<P>
 McNaull (6-10, 255) had 10 points and 10 rebounds against Montana, and played 
aggressively around the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe played the way we want Joe to play," Greenberg said. "He can give us a 
presence we haven't had at Long Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 McNaull, who averages six points and five rebounds, said he now feels 
comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you sit out a year, I think it takes some time to get adjusted to 
things," he said. "I'm getting there now, and that's showing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The thief of Long Beach: Junior point guard Rasul Salahuddin is tied for the 
Division I lead in steals with an average of five per game, according to the 
NCAA leaders list released Dec. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Salahuddin, who has 20 steals in four games, is tied with Louisville's Tick 
Rogers, who has 35 in seven games. Salahuddin also averages nine points and 6.3 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the mix: Senior forward Terrance O'Kelley, suspended from the Montana 
game by Greenberg because of his academic performance, will play with the 49ers 
in Michigan State's Spartan Classic on Thursday and Friday at East Lansing, 
Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Kelley (6-7, 245), who was eligible according to NCAA and school standards, 
averages 6.7 points and a team-leading five rebounds. He was a third-team 
All-Big West selection as a junior.

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER; IT'S NO CLICHE; ANTEATER BASKETBALL TEAM 
WINNING WITH BALANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rod Baker does a pretty good job of avoiding coach-speak and rhetoric, but 
lately the UC Irvine coach is prone to point out the significant contribution 
of the whole roster, at least in terms of preparation if not game-night 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a 15-man, team victory," he let slip recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Was he simply overwhelmed with holiday spirit or just plain giddy with a 
two-game winning streak? Maybe a little of both, but -- cliche or not -- there 
is a measure of truth here . . . forgetting the walk-ons for the moment. The 
Anteaters (4-3) have a winning record after seven games for the first time in 
Baker's tenure at Irvine and a lot of players have excelled during the four 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
 No one played more than 28 minutes during the Anteaters' 75-68 victory over 
Pepperdine Dec. 3 and five players had nine or more points. Chris Brown led 
with 17. Five Anteaters had five or more rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 A week later, six players scored nine or more points and they beat University 
of San Diego, 73-70. 
</P>
<P>
 During an 89-73 romp over Oregon State last week, eight Anteaters scored seven 
or more and the reserves combined for 34 points. Freshman forward Kevin Simmons 
had 17 points and 11 rebounds and point guard Raimonds Miglinieks had 10 points 
and 12 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 And forward Michael Tate led the way with 15 points and 13 rebounds during a 
69-66 victory over St. Mary's. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters no longer have to rely on Brown to hit 10 three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, we had a few really great performances from a few people," Baker 
said. "So far this year, we've never really had that. A lot of guys have been 
steady, though." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Numbers game: When reading an Irvine box score, the productivity of a position 
is more significant than one player's statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, point guards Miglinieks and Zuri Williams are combining to 
average 14 points, nine assists and only five turnovers. Shooting guards Brown 
and Brian Keefe are producing 17 points a game. And Mark Odsather and Khalid 
Channell are combining for 17 points and seven rebounds at small forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, starting post players Simmons and Tate and reserves Shaun Battle and 
LaDay Smith are putting up 25 points and taking down 24 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Weird science: Baker has the confidence to make substitutions at almost any 
time, but those 10 players are not exactly interchangeable parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Odsather and Channell could not be more different, for example. Odsather 
relies heavily on his outside shooting and in-the-right-place-at-the-right-time 
instincts to score and rebound underneath. Channell uses his jumping ability 
and athleticism to rebound and dunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons, a freshman, likes to shoot outside and use finesse moves to score on 
driving bank shots. Then Battle comes in the game and resorts to brute force to 
get the job done. 
</P>
<P>
 Miglinieks creates offensive situations with his ability to dribble through 
traffic, disrupt a defensive scheme and find the open man. Williams runs the 
offense in a more conventional style and plays intense defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown can score 15 points in a couple of minutes when he's hot. Keefe can 
shoot outside, too, but is just as likely to score on a baseline drive. 
</P>
<P>
 It makes for a chameleon team with a myriad of styles that vary depending on 
who is on the floor. But Baker doesn't worry much about combinations or the 
chemistry of which players work best together. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it confusing for us? I don't think so," he said. "Is it confusing for our 
opponents? I think so, because we change radically depending on who's in the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perspective break: Tate helped lead his Ventura College team to the State 
community college championship game last March and he played on two Los Angeles 
City championship teams at Fremont High. 
</P>
<P>
 He's glad the Anteaters have won two in a row, but he's not too sure why some 
of his teammates are so excited. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been hard for me," Tate said. "I mean we started the season 0-2 and 
since I started playing basketball in elementary school, I've never started a 
season 0-2. It was a big, big shock to me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Brown out? Brown, who led the nation in three-point shooting last season, 
powered the Anteaters' run to the Big West tournament championship game with 24 
three-pointers in four games. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of that success, however, Brown hasn't had a lot of good looks at 
the basket lately and the Anteaters have faced a zone defense for a few 
possessions in only one game this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are simply not allowing him to shoot as much as he did last year," 
Baker said. "And so we're looking at a different Chris Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who has made 22 of 70 three-pointers this season, is forcing some shots 
and trying to do too much to create shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always tell Chris he has to be more of an all-around player," Baker said, 
"and he wants to demonstrate that he's more than a standstill shooter. But you 
don't abandon what you do best to demonstrate other skills." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Century city: Odsather slipped into a room where Baker was talking to the 
media after Friday night's victory over St. Mary's and presented him with a 
framed certificate commemorating his 100th career victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker, who picked up 73 of those victories while head coach at Tufts 
University, noticed that the date and opponent were prominently displayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They must have had a whole bunch of these ready so they could slip the right 
one in when we finally got it," he said. "You know what this really means? It 
means that if you can fool people into letting you do this long enough, sooner 
or later you're going to win 100."

FOR SOME, HAPPINESS IS LUBBOCK; IT MAY NOT BE EASY TO LURE THEM TO TEXAS TECH, 
BUT THEY LIKE IT ONCE THEY GET THERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some cities aspire to be compared to Paris. For others, it is New York, London 
or Rome. Lubbock wanted to be Peoria. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years ago, the Texas panhandle city almost made it. Nearing the end of his 
first 100 days in office, President George Bush, responding to criticism that 
his administration started lamely, said, "All the people in Lubbock think 
things are going just great." 
</P>
<P>
 Seizing the opportunity to become known as Middle America's hometown, as a 
similarly anonymous Illinois city had done when the Nixon Administration began 
gauging the country's mood by asking, "Will it play in Peoria?," Lubbock 
officials paid $6,100 for an advertisement in the Wall Street Journal's 
Washington-Baltimore edition. 
</P>
<P>
 The headline read: "D.C., Phone Home." 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign was no more successful than Bush's next one. Lubbock did not 
become famous outside the state, where it already was known as the home of 
Buddy Holly and Texas Tech University. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little question which distinction Lubbock appreciates more. When an 
out-of-state reporter asked a few years ago for a ride to the legendary rock 
star's grave, the taxi driver asked, "Who's he?" But Texas Tech is a constant 
source of pride, never more so than when its football team this year earned a 
Cotton Bowl berth -- against USC -- for the first time since 1939. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the Red Raiders limped to their goal with a 6-5 record, emerging 
as the disintegrating Southwest Conference's representative in a mathematical 
calculation that would have taxed Einstein after a five-way tie for first 
place, is no more than a footnote on the Plains. 
</P>
<P>
 It will play in Lubbock. 
</P>
<P>
 The SWC office in Dallas reported a record number of orders on the first day 
tickets went on sale after the Red Raiders clinched the berth. Texas Tech sold 
out its 20,000-ticket allotment within 48 hours and was eagerly awaiting USC's 
leftovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judging from ticket sales, everybody in town is going to the game," said Greg 
Vaughn, an executive with the Lubbock Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who drive the 350 miles to Dallas will have a chance to experience the 
sentiments of the city's second-most famous musician, Mac Davis, who wrote a 
song with the lyrics, "Happiness is Lubbock, Texas in my rearview mirror." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the lyrics, Davis intended the song as a compliment, which he 
eventually extends in the third verse or so by proclaiming Lubbock as a pretty 
decent place to live. About 187,000 people -- 250,000 in the metropolitan area 
-- apparently agree with him, and the only reason there are not more, Vaughn 
said, is because there are not enough jobs available for those who want to 
remain after finishing their stays at Texas Tech, Lubbock Christian University, 
nearby South Plains College or Reese Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
 Located on the fertile Caprock Plateau, almost as close to Denver as to 
Dallas, the region's economy revolves around agriculture, primarily cotton. In 
an effort to lure more white-collar jobs, the Chamber of Commerce in recent 
years has targeted Southern California companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tell them about our outstanding quality of life, our low cost of living, 
our strong, stable economy, our excellent infrastructure and our good, steady 
growth," Vaughn said. "But most of all, we tell them about the hospitality of 
the people who live here and our strong sense of community. I hope that doesn't 
sound too much like American Gothic." 
</P>
<P>
 But even those who love Lubbock, such as former resident Bob Condron, admit 
that the city does not make a good first impression. When he was an assistant 
sports information director at Texas Tech in the late '60s, he said the 
football coaches arranged for recruits from larger cities such as Dallas and 
Houston to fly in at night so that they would not be shocked by the dull, flat 
landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 From the press box at Texas Tech's Jones Stadium during those years, the only 
neon that could be spotted for miles was on the sign outside a gas station 
advertising "GOOD GULF." But because some burned-out lights on the sign went 
unchanged for almost a decade, former University of Texas sports information 
director Jones Ramsey began referring to the Red Raiders' home as "GO GUL 
Stadium," a name that stuck around the SWC. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't see many calendars featuring Lubbock scenery," said Condron, now in 
media relations for the U.S. Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 If the scenery, or lack of it, does not put off visitors, the weather might. 
It is often said that the only thing to break the wind on the vast plains 
between Canada and Mexico is a barbed-wire fence in Lubbock, and outings there 
are as likely to be threatened by snowstorms as dust storms. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps that explains Texas Tech's difficulty in recruiting, and although it 
has had some outstanding players, such as Donnie Anderson, E.J. Holub, Dave 
Parks, Billy Joe Tolliver, and Bam Morris, it has had few outstanding teams. 
</P>
<P>
 During the SWC's glory years, the Red Raiders were never as good as Texas and 
Arkansas and never as bad as Rice and TCU. "We've always had a strong hold on 
the middle," said Jack Dale, the team's longtime radio play-by-play announcer. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 edition, dominated by freshmen and sophomores, did not appear bound 
for loftier heights, especially after its stallion mascot, Double T, was killed 
in a bizarre accident during the opening game. Some suspected suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Red Raiders rallied, advancing to their first major bowl despite a 
record that would cause no one in D.C., or hardly anywhere else outside 
Lubbock, to phone home.

 The outcome of the Jan. 2 Citrus Bowl game between Ohio State (9-3) and 
Alabama (11-1) might be decided by how well each team adjusts to its previous 
game. Ohio State is on a clear high after defeating Michigan for the first time 
since 1987, 22-6.The only negative was that the Buckeye players accidentally 
dropped Coach John Cooper when they were carrying him from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Alabama lost a shot at the national championship when it was beaten 
by Florida, 24-23, in the Southeastern Conference championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Jay Barker is still trying to rationalize the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have liked to win the (Florida) game, but that's in the past now," 
Barker said last week. "We've had some time to get over that and now the only 
thing we are thinking about is the Citrus Bowl." JOHN CHERWA

THE BOWLS DAILY REPORT; SUGAR; REAL ACTION MIGHT COME OFF FIELD

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Florida-Florida State rivalry is rather pronounced, but the players say 
the real animosity is off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both teams have trash talkers, but it's going to be all fun," Florida 
cornerback Larry Kennedy told the Orlando Sentinel. "I think the hatred will 
come more between the fans than the players." 
</P>
<P>
 Gator coaches have even warned the players to avoid any confrontations with 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the fans will consider it a friendly rivalry," Florida punter 
Shayne Edge told the Sentinel. "There may be only 30,000 people in the seats. 
The others will be in jail." JOHN CHERWA

 Arizona Coach Dick Tomey hired Utah Coach Ron McBride to coach the Wildcat 
offensive line from 1987-89 and they remain good friends going into tonight's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was with him at Disneyland (Saturday)," Tomey needled. "It was like being 
with a damn folk hero. We couldn't take 10 steps before somebody stopped him to 
shake his hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Replied McBride: "Dick's taking that (Texas Tech Coach) Spike Dykes approach, 
saying, 'Y'all come down and play us. We're scared to death of you.' Then, they 
kick the hell out of you." ELLIOTT TEAFORD

TOP 10 REASONS FOR UTAH AND ARIZONA; FREEDOM BOWL: NO. 10 IS THAT TONIGHT'S 
WINNER MIGHT GET THAT RANKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The 1994 Freedom Bowl again matches teams that would rather be playing 
somewhere else, against someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 14-ranked Utah (9-2) and No. 15 Arizona (8-3) make tonight's contest the 
best, most competitive matchup in the 11-year history of the Anaheim Stadium 
game. Moreover, both up-and-coming powers could benefit from a victory, and the 
coaches appear to have hammered that notion into the players' heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Lofty rankings and national reputations haven't always assured quality games 
in the Freedom Bowl, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Who can forget such belly flops as USC's 1992 embarrassment by Fresno State? 
Or Florida's virtual no-show against Washington in 1989? 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the Trojans talked tough, then got blind-sided, 24-7, by the 
passing of the Bulldogs' Trent Dilfer. In '89, the Gators' Emmitt Smith made it 
clear he didn't want to be in Anaheim, gaining only 17 yards in a 34-7 Husky 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps that's why Utah Coach Ron McBride and Arizona Coach Dick Tomey spent 
so much time Monday answering questions about motivation, disappointment and 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah, it was pointed out repeatedly, would be playing Michigan in the Holiday 
Bowl Friday at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium if not for losing consecutive 
games to New Mexico and Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Arizona would be preparing for Penn State in next Monday's Rose Bowl 
if not for conference losses to Oregon and USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Each coach said letdowns shouldn't be a problem by tonight's 6 p.m. kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were past that (the 45-28 loss to USC on Nov. 12) the moment it happened," 
Tomey said. "Our next game was Arizona State and that's our most important game 
of the year. Our players get on to the things at hand, and I'm sure the guys 
from Utah did the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 McBride, a member of Tomey's staff in 1987-89, said: "I couldn't be happier 
than to be in the Freedom Bowl. We're all excited to be here." 
</P>
<P>
 Luther Elliss, Utah's All-American defensive lineman, put this spin on the 
game: "With this win we'll be in the top 10 and we'll have the best record in 
school history. This game is very, very important. It will establish Utah as 
one of the top teams in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's winner could well be ranked No. 10 or even higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be huge," McBride said. "How many times have you seen Utah in 
the top 10?" 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Never at the end of a season. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona's best finish was No. 10 after its 29-0 victory over Miami in the 
Fiesta Bowl last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's game features a battle between Utah's high-powered offense, directed 
by quarterback Mike McCoy, and Arizona's suffocating defense, led by 
All-American defensive end Tedy Bruschi. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah's offense averaged 37 points and 448 yards, scoring 30 or more points in 
nine of 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona's defense allowed an average of 16 points and 285 yards, holding 
opponents to 10 or fewer points in six of 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Only in the loss to USC were the Wildcats badly beaten defensively. The 
Trojans compiled 550 yards, including 390 passing by quarterback Rob Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got nailed, frankly, in that game," Tomey said.

THE BOWLS DAILY REPORT; ROSE; NOTE TO DUCKS: SUN CAN BE SEEN HERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY and SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The only concern Oregon coaches and players had as they arrived in Pasadena on 
Monday to resume preparation for their Jan. 2 game against Penn State was the 
strange ball of fire in the sky.  
</P>
<P>
 Known here as the sun, it is seldom seen at this time of the year in the 
Ducks' home of Eugene, Ore. As Mike Ward, president of the Pasadena Tournament 
of Roses, welcomed them in a ceremony in the plaza of the Doubletree Hotel, 
many players huddled in the shade to protect their sensitive skin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry about the weather," Ward said. "I didn't realize we'd have to be 
outside." 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon Coach Rich Brooks said that he would add extra sprints to the practices 
that began Monday at Glendora's Citrus College to help the players acclimate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have to take a few days to get adjusted to the extra heat down here," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of 96 players on the traveling squad, only Kip East, a defensive back from San 
Jose who is not eligible to play because he is a redshirt, did not arrive by 
Monday's 2 p.m. team meeting. He missed his flight from the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two players who feared that they might not arrive on time were linebackers 
Jeremy Asher and Rich Ruhl, who drove. After their car broke down in 
Bakersfield, they briefly considered hitchhiking the rest of the way. Instead, 
they slept on the decision in a low-budget motel, eventually choosing to rent a 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Oregon players drove to Pasadena, taking advantage of an NCAA rule that 
allows bowl participants to receive cash for the amount of the air fare from 
their hometowns to the site of the game even if they choose not to fly. But 24 
are from Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even though a victory by Miami over No. 1-ranked Nebraska in the Orange Bowl 
Sunday night would enhance No. 2 Penn State's chance at a national 
championship, Coach Joe Paterno said, "I don't know if I can bring myself to 
root for Miami because (Nebraska Coach) Tom Osborne is a good friend of mine . 
. . and he needs a win down there." 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne's Cornhuskers have lost seven consecutive bowl games, six in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Miami, Osborne told Orange Bowl reporters that he would rather his 
Nebraska team be playing Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a real tragedy that the people in college football, if they're 
not going to have a playoff, are not going to be able to somehow have two teams 
who are undefeated . . . get together somehow," Osborne said. RANDY HARVEY and 
SHAV GLICK

 Miami Coach Dennis Erickson walked out of an interview after practice when 
asked about the Seattle Seahawks' coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson, preparing the No. 3 Hurricanes for Sunday's Orange Bowl against No. 
1 Nebraska, has been mentioned regarding NFL coaching jobs in Seattle, Denver 
and expansion Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about Tom Flores' likely ouster as the Seahawks' coach, Erickson 
walked away from reporters without a word. Flores, coming off a 6-10 season, is 
to have his future in Seattle determined this week when he meets with team 
owner Ken Behring. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, Erickson said he would entertain NFL offers. In the last two 
weeks, the former Washington State coach has been rumored as the front-runner 
to replace Flores. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hurricanes are 63-8, including two national championships, in Erickson's 
six years.

GIRLS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; COSTA MESA SNAPS TO LIFE LATE, DEFEATS SANTA 
MARGARITA, 58-42 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Costa Mesa girls' basketball team was lifeless for three quarters in the 
opening round of the Costa Mesa Winter Classic Monday, but the Mustangs opened 
the fourth quarter with a 21-2 run and defeated Santa Margarita, 58-42. 
</P>
<P>
 With the victory, Costa Mesa (7-3) advanced to today's quarterfinals, where 
the Mustangs will face Capistrano Valley (7-2) at 8 p.m. The Cougars routed the 
North Torrance junior varsity, 68-29. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs struggled early, but scored nine straight points to take a 14-6 
lead after one quarter. Corri Lurmann led Costa Mesa, scoring eight points and 
grabbing seven rebounds while playing only the final 4 1/2 minutes of the 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa led by as many as 12 points in the second quarter, but the Eagles 
rallied in the third. Santa Margarita (3-2) opened the second half with a 12-4 
run to close the margin to 28-27, and then Shannon Redfern hit a three-pointer 
at the buzzer to make it 31-30 going to the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we kind of outcoached ourselves," Mustang Coach Len Whitacre said. 
"We felt we could play strong man-to-man defense and we weren't going to show 
our full-court press if we didn't have to." 
</P>
<P>
 With Costa Mesa leading by one entering the fourth quarter, Whitacre decided 
it was time to break out the press. And break out the Mustangs did. Costa Mesa 
scored 16 consecutive points in less than three minutes, taking a 52-32 lead 
with 3:26 to play. Santa Margarita committed nine of its 29 turnovers in the 
final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite picking up the victory, Whitacre was less than ecstatic with his 
team's play. Costa Mesa shot only 31% from the field (19 of 61) and turned the 
ball over 24 times. "It was a very ugly game," he said. "I don't know what 
happened -- we had played four good games in a row until today. We're going to 
have to play a lot better (today) or we're going to get killed." 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa's Koo Kim had a game-high 25 points, including four three-pointers, 
and Lurmann added 14 points and 13 rebounds in a reserve role for the Mustangs. 
Santa Margarita held a 47-40 rebounding edge thanks to freshman Michelle 
Chambers (14 rebounds) and sophomore Tiffani Mendivil (12 rebounds). Redfern, 
who had 20 points, was the only Eagle to score in double figures. ERIC MADDY

SANTA ANITA LOOKING FOR JOCKEYS; HORSE RACING: REPLACEMENT RIDERS MIGHT BE 
NECESSARY IF AGREEMENT IS NOT REACHED BEFORE MIDNIGHT SATURDAY IN NATIONAL 
HEALTH AND ACCIDENT INSURANCE DISPUTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cliff Goodrich, president of Santa Anita, said Monday that the track is making 
arrangements to find replacement riders if many of the regular jockeys don't 
ride Sunday because of a national dispute with Thoroughbred Racing Assns. 
tracks over health and accident insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference attended by both sides in the stalled negotiations 
between the Jockeys' Guild and the tracks, Goodrich also said Santa Anita's 
business would be affected by the absence of important jockeys. Chris McCarron, 
who was also present at the conference, and other leading riders are not 
expected to ride if a new insurance contract is not signed. The existing 
contract runs out at midnight Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without the regular jockeys, it would affect attendance to some degree, and 
handle to a greater degree," Goodrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 During a 12-day jockey walkout at Aqueduct in 1988, betting dropped $10 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 There are more than 450 jockeys licensed to ride thoroughbreds and quarter 
horses in California, and trainers at Santa Anita would be able to draw from 
this pool, as well as from out-of-state riders. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can't get the jockey I want to ride my horse, then I'll go to the next 
best available," horse owner Ed Friendly said. "The jockeys are negotiating 
with the wrong parties. It would be unconscionable for the jockeys to strike 
because the TRA has nothing to do with racing in California, where the jockeys 
are viewed as employees, not independent contractors, and where the horse 
owners pay for workers' compensation to cover them." 
</P>
<P>
 The TRA is a trade group that represents 40 tracks in the United States and 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarron attended the conference after returning to Santa Anita from a nearby 
hospital, where X-rays of his bruised ribs were negative. McCarron and two 
other riders were injured after a horse broke down in the first race. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's an example of why we need better insurance," jockey Alex Solis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The executive board of the Jockeys' Guild, which includes McCarron, was 
scheduled to conduct a telephone conference call Monday night. Brian McGrath, 
commissioner of the TRA, said he would be willing to talk with the guild later 
this week, but no meetings are scheduled. McGrath reiterated that the TRA's 
proposal, made on Nov. 6, is "our best and final offer." 
</P>
<P>
 The TRA has been willing to pay $1.7 million toward jockeys' insurance 
premiums but has rejected a guild proposal to deduct one-tenth of 1% from 
betting, which the jockeys say would raise between $9 million and $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even think we're discussing insurance, we're discussing broadcast 
rights," McCarron said. "The issue is what value there is to the jockeys' 
broadcast rights. When that signal is sent out, for nationally televised races 
and simulcast races, I've assigned my rights and that should mean something. I 
know it's far-fetched and sounds crazy, but if the jockeys rode in masks and 
nobody knew who they were, it'd be interesting to see what the effect would be 
on the handle." 
</P>
<P>
 The TRA has offered to increase the jockeys' accident coverage, including a 
jump from $50,000 to $62,500 for medical and surgical coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you break your pelvis, that's good for about two months," jockey Corey 
Nakatani said.

ROYAL'S SMITH OPTS TO PLAY FOOTBALL FOR WASHINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jermaine Smith, an All-Ventura County defensive back from Royal High, said 
Monday he will sign a letter of intent to play football at Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith (6-feet, 180 pounds) visited Washington and Arizona State.He canceled 
trips to UCLA, Nevada Las Vegas and Colorado State after picking the Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like how (Washington) plays its defense," he said. "It's a lot of man to 
man, and that's what I like playing the best. They have a good wining program 
and they made a lot of trips to the Rose Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, an All-Marmonte League selection, had one interception and nine pass 
deflections this season.  
</P>
<P>
 He is the third Royal player to make a college commitment. Besides Smith, 
center Steve Zirnite (Fresno State) and fullback Mike Reddington (Navy), 
tailback Jerome Lee is also expected to sign a letter of intent during the NCAA 
football signing period in February. JEFF FLETCHER

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A look at The Times' preseason poll's top 20 high school boys' basketball 
teams in the City and Southern sections, with division, last season's record 
and comment by Times prep editor Eric Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
 1. SANTA ANA MATER DEI 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Section, Division I-A 
</P>
<P>
 Last season: 33-1, beat Edison, 65-59, in Div. I-A final. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Three more years of Schea Cotton means three more years of winning 
for Mater Dei, which lost to Crenshaw in the State Southern Regional final last 
season. Cotton, a 6-foot-5 sophomore sensation, might be the best player in the 
state. He is joined by 6-7 forward Shaun Jackson and 6-2 guard Clay McKnight. 
</P>
<P>
 2. COMPTON DOMINGUEZ 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Section, Division II-A 
</P>
<P>
 Last season: 28-4, lost to St. John Bosco, 55-54, in Div. II-A final. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Tommy Prince, a 6-6 All-State forward, heads a deep lineup. Added to 
an already strong roster is forward-guard James Brown, a transfer from Long 
Beach Poly, and 6-4 freshman Jason Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 3. CRENSHAW 
</P>
<P>
 City Section, Division 4-A 
</P>
<P>
 Last season: 29-2, beat Dorsey, 72-53, in Div. 4-A final. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: The two-time defending State Division I champions are almost an 
entirely new team this season but it is difficult to bet against their winning 
tradition. Ronnie Arch, a 6-6 forward, is the only returning starter. Corey 
Williams, a 6-5 forward, is a talented transfer from Ribet Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 4. WESTCHESTER 
</P>
<P>
 City Section, Division 4-A 
</P>
<P>
 Last season: 23-5, lost to Dorsey, 71-68, in Div. 4-A quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: The Comets have something to prove after being upset in the playoffs 
last season. They should contend for the title this time with 6-3 guard Ben 
Sanders and 6-0 guard Danny Walker leading the way. Each is averaging in double 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
 5. FONTANA 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Section, Division I-AA 
</P>
<P>
 Last season: 26-1, lost to Crescenta Valley, 85-77, in Div. I-AA 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Corey Benjamin, a 6-6 junior forward, has established himself as one 
of the state's top players. He averaged 18 points as a sophomore and played 
well last summer. The Steelers, who have been on the rise in recent years, hope 
to improve on last season's disappointing end in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 6. INGLEWOOD 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Section Division II-A 
</P>
<P>
 Last season: 30-4, beat Riverside North, 77-59, in Div. II-AA final. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Paul Pierce, a 6-7 forward, is the lone returning starter for 
Inglewood but is the Southland's top prospect. With the skills to play either 
point guard or power forward, Pierce is one of the most-recruited players in 
the nation and will sign this spring. He averaged 23 points and 11 rebounds 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 7. TUSTIN 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Section, Division II-A 
</P>
<P>
 Last season: 22-8, lost to Dominguez, 70-35, in Div. II-A semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: The Tillers have four starters returning, including 6-0 guard Doug 
Gottlieb, who has already signed with Notre Dame. Gottlieb averaged 18 points 
and eight assists last season. He receives support from 6-7 forward David 
Lalazarian, who also averages in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
 8. CRESCENTA VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Section, Division II-AA 
</P>
<P>
 Last season: 19-10, lost to Long Beach Poly, 70-61, in Div. I-AA final. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Crescenta Valley squeaked into the playoffs last season as an 
at-large entry and then surprised everybody by advancing to the final. Most of 
the players are back, including 6-4 guard Brock Jacobsen and 6-8 center Blake 
Jacobson. 
</P>
<P>
 9. RIVERSIDE NORTH 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Section, Division II-AA 
</P>
<P>
 Last season: 29-2, lost to Inglewood, 77-59, in Div. II-AA final. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Coach Mike Bartee has built North into one of the Southland's most 
respected programs. Although the Huskies are without a top-name player, they 
still have enough talent to contend. Brian Hooks, a 6-3 guard/forward, and 
Chris Claiborne, a 6-3 forward, return after averaging in double figures last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 10. SANTA ANA VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Section, Division I-AA 
</P>
<P>
 Last season: 26-4, lost to Crescenta Valley, 69-67, in Div. I-AA semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Santa Ana Valley became an instant contender last season when guard 
Olujimi Mann transferred from Mater Dei. Mann, a 6-5 junior, averaged 20 points 
and was selected as the state's sophomore player of the year by Cal-Hi Sports. 
Mann is back and will be helped by transfers Ike Harmon, a 6-7 forward from 
Century, and Virgil Forbin, a 6-3 forward from Loara. 
</P>
<P>
 11. LONG BEACH WILSON 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Section, Division I-AA 
</P>
<P>
 Last season: 22-8, lost to Long Beach Poly, 61-43, in Div. I-AA semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Wilson's starting lineup includes a big front line of 6-9 Michael 
Batiste, 6-6 Tyrell Maynor and 6-6 Roy Blanchard. The Bruins would have been 
rated higher if 6-4 guard Eric White had not been declared ineligible. Expect a 
close race in the Moore League. 
</P>
<P>
 12. GLENDORA 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Section, Division I-A 
</P>
<P>
 Last season: 27-3, lost to Riverside North, 66-63 in Div. II-AA semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: For the first time in seven years, Glendora is without a Murray -- 
Tracy or Cameron -- in the lineup. Coach Mike LeDuc, however, has considerable 
remaining talent. The scoring leader is guard Greg Jacobsen. 
</P>
<P>
 13. LAKEWOOD ARTESIA 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Section, Division III-AA 
</P>
<P>
 Last season: 15-9, lost to Redondo, 68-62, in Div. II-A first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Watch for Artesia to bounce back after a disappointing season. The 
Pioneers added strength when 6-8 center Jonathan Nelson transferred from 
Lynwood. Guard DeAndre Moore, a 5-8 freshman, should also make an immediate 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
 14. PASADENA MUIR 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Section, Division II-A 
</P>
<P>
 Last season: 20-11, lost to Tustin, 69-65, in Div. II-A quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Senior Duane Curtis, a 6-3 guard, is one of the area's top prospects 
and will sign with a college in the spring. He averaged 20 points last season 
and is the main strength in an explosive lineup that also includes 6-3 
guard/forward Anthony White and 5-10 guard Quincy Stinson. 
</P>
<P>
 15. NORTH HOLLYWOOD HARVARD-WESTLAKE 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Section, Division III-A 
</P>
<P>
 Last season: 24-3, lost to San Dimas, 74-63, in Div. III-A semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Harvard-Westlake improved from a .500 team to a contender last season 
with the addition of twins Jason and Jarron Collins. Although only 15, the 
Collins brothers are big-time players. Jason is 6-10, Jarron 6-9 and each has 
added 20 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 16. VERBUM DEI 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Section, Division IV-A 
</P>
<P>
 Last season: 26-3, beat Santa Clara, 71-65, in Div. IV-A final. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Coach Mike Kearney welcomes back another strong team with scoring 
power. Junior guard Deon Williams, one of the area's best, is joined by 6-6 
forward Andre Larry and 6-4 forward Andre Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 17. LA PUENTE NOGALES 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Section, Division I-A 
</P>
<P>
 Last season: 19-6, lost to Crescenta Valley, 72-61, in Div. I-AA first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Nogales dropped into Division I-A this season but will face a tough 
road in the playoffs against such contenders as Mater Dei and Glendora. The 
Nobles have one of the area's top point guards in Shomario Richard, a 6-3 
senior who averaged 26 points and nine assists last season. 
</P>
<P>
 18. MANUAL ARTS 
</P>
<P>
 City Section, Division 4-A 
</P>
<P>
 Last season: 20-5, lost to Reseda Cleveland, 63-58, in Div. 4-A first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Despite its talent of the last two seasons, Manual Arts was 
eliminated in the first round of the playoffs. The Toilers hope their fortunes 
improve this time, and 6-7 forward Travis Reed should help. The sophomore 
standout is a transfer from Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 19. FAIRFAX 
</P>
<P>
 City Section, Division 4-A 
</P>
<P>
 Last season: 21-6, lost to Fremont, 55-47, in Div. 4-A quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Fairfax has produced many college prospects in previous years and 
this team is no different. Duane Davis, a 5-10 point guard, is the latest 
recruiting prize. The senior averaged 16 points last season and played well 
during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 20. BELLFLOWER ST. JOHN BOSCO 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Section, Division I-AA 
</P>
<P>
 Last season: 28-3, beat Dominguez, 55-54, in Div. II-A final. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: St. John Bosco voluntarily moved up a division this season despite 
losing all-star Jelani Gardner. The Braves have the necessary size to contend 
for a title with 6-8 forward Chad Bell and 6-6 forward Brian Johnson leading 
the way.

FIXATIONS / ORANGE COUNTY: FROM A REAL GRAVE DIGGER TO A LUCY LOVER, THEY 
FOLLOWED THEIR BLISS INSTEAD OF THE CROWD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So they laughed when you started collecting "I Dream of Jeannie" lunch pails, 
wearing begrimed brain-tanned buckskins and living in a cave, did they?  
</P>
<P>
 Did they snicker as you walked a tightrope in flesh-toned briefs or started 
coveting Barbie dolls or running model railroad tracks through every room of 
your house? 
</P>
<P>
 Did they take bets on how soon your business would fail when you opened 
emporiums offering ducktail haircuts, old produce labels and $150-per-foot 
speaker wire? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, let them laugh. 1994 may not have been a banner year in the county on 
most other fronts, being bankrupt and all, but it did provide the breeding 
place for The Revenge of the Fixated!  
</P>
<P>
 When we started the Fixations column, it was done with certain fears that we 
would run out of interesting subjects after, say, three weeks, since Orange 
County is generally regarded as containing the originality and creative spark 
of a cinder block. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet here we are more than three years along, and O.C. has proven itself to be 
a seemingly inexhaustible trove of premium-grade weirdness, and 1994 produced a 
bumper crop. Launching this column we defined fixations as the "passions, 
hobbies, causes and predilections that get a bit out of hand in some people's 
lives, perhaps certifiably so." We're talking here about people willing to 
flout convention to follow their inner voice, whether it leads them to collect 
Bozo the Clown icons or to write an exhaustive history of the postal envelope. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The clearest sign of this year's ascendancy of the weird is the Fullerton 
Museum Center's exhibition "Gotta Have It! The Nature of Collecting." The 
exhibit, which continues through Feb. 19, features 18 distinctive county 
collectors, several of whom, we are proud to say, are Fixations alumni. 
</P>
<P>
 One of our earliest subjects, Guy Ball, once had to keep his ultra-nerdy 
collection of '70s pocket calculators in a closet, and now he can proudly 
display them to the world within the ratifying walls of a museum. Not far from 
them is Roger Ellison's 628-piece collection of rubber ducks, up from the 510 
he had when we interviewed him a couple of years back.  
</P>
<P>
 One favorite Fixations subject was Chris Butler, who with his daughter Roxanne 
(who also collects Little Orphan Annie items) amasses anything pertaining to 
Lucille Ball. Several acquaintances have called him a kook for his devotion to 
Lucy (which includes weekly sojourns to L.A. to take Roxanne for walks in 
Lucy's old neighborhood), and he scotched an appearance on the Montel Williams 
show at the last minute, he says, when he found they intended to portray him as 
a nut. 
</P>
<P>
 Does he then find some validation of his pursuit to have his Lucy finds 
featured in a museum next to other significant collections? 
</P>
<P>
 "It had a resounding effect on Roxanne, to see that she is part of a society 
that collects. But for me, this might not sound kind, but I don't care about 
those other things," he said with a laugh. "I looked around and thought, 'Gosh, 
my stuff looks nice next to all this junk,' and I suppose the other collectors 
probably thought the same of mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, one man's trash is another's treasure. "Gotta Have It!" ranges from Edie 
Bonk's giddy assemblage of Bozo items (featured in the Nov. 29 Fixations) to 
retired Marine Maj. Bill Mimiaga's harrowing war mementos, which include a 
German concentration camp prisoner's uniform, and a guard's cap -- one of half 
a dozen known to exist in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 When we first talked with Mimiaga two years ago, his primary collection was 
GIJoe dolls. Somewhat surprisingly, he proved to be a thoughtful history 
enthusiast, whose accurately garbed GI Joe dolls were part of a war-relics 
collection he gathered to make tangible the human condition in war. 
</P>
<P>
 He's since sold off his GI Joes -- raking in $52,000, in case the practical 
among you scoff at such collections -- and traded his Marine major designation 
for a grad school history major at Cal State Fullerton. He's reinvested most of 
his doll proceeds in his wartime collection. Though many of his items are 
irreplaceable, he's pleased to have his collection on public display. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the things I have are very rare. Most were destroyed by the Germans 
or the governments that cooperated with them, because they were ashamed and 
wanted to forget," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the items: swastika-bearing Bosnian gear from when they, the current 
victims of "ethnic cleansing," were themselves doing the same to the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 "These items are a way of remembering the events of World War II, and even the 
Civil War, that are still effecting us. For me to keep them to myself in a 
closet or shoe box is stupid," Mimiaga said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "Follow your bliss," advised the late Joseph Campbell, and he had something 
there. In a time when job insecurity is rampant, several Fixations subjects 
have parlayed their curious interests into careers.  
</P>
<P>
 Orange's Jake Bricks, for example, got tired of the dirty looks his rockabilly 
buddies got in other barber shops, so he opened one of his own. There, his love 
for all things 1950s has created a time-machine vision of sartorial style, and 
customers flock to him. 
</P>
<P>
 We spoke with John Rosenfield, whose love of old guitars and rock 'n' roll 
memorabilia led him to a high-profile job as curator to the Hard Rock Cafes. 
Phyllis Estrella of Fullerton and her family parlayed a fixation on the zoot 
suits featured in the Luis Valdez play "Zoot Suit" into a flourishing rental 
and sales business, named El Pachuco, for the flashy drapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex de Ulloa and Tim Krehbiel, the owners of Anaheim's Arrowsmith Automotive, 
weren't hacking it in their white-collar jobs, so now they're joyfully up to 
their eyebrows in grease, restoring 1930s woody wagons and cars they love. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone's dreams have panned out so well. The second most quixotic 
fixation of the year was Walt Netschert and his Equalizer hat. Netschert, 
a.k.a. Captain Huff 'n' Puff, is an Orange-based engineer and smoking 
enthusiast who has devised a huge plastic hat with an air filter that makes it 
possible, he says, to light up anywhere without smoke escaping to offend 
others. Not that it's without a social stigma of its own: Wearing it, you look 
like you've got an In-N-Out Burger stand on your head. 
</P>
<P>
 Since our article, he's attracted some media interest -- including spots on 
the CBS program "America Tonight" and Italian television -- but has found nary 
a financial backer. He's now hoping to interest Japanese investors, while 
soldiering on in his pro-smoking quest by finishing what he is calling his 
Martyr Kit for California Smokers.  
</P>
<P>
 He explained: "For restaurants that don't allow smoking, you order their food 
to go, then in front of the place take out this red canvas bag that contains a 
TV-dinner tray with two ashtrays, a stool, and a canopy that reads 'Exiled 
Smoker.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The most quixotic Fixation subject by far was Cliff Springmeier. If there's 
anything harder than battling anti-smoking ire, it's battling Mother Nature. 
For the past five years Springmeier has been building a remarkable, incredibly 
detailed model railroad world, running through nearly every room of his home 
and through his yard. 
</P>
<P>
 It's some indication of his locomotive focus that when asked recently how the 
structure is doing, he started talking about how the outdoor scale model homes 
have weathered the winter. Meanwhile, the structure we meant, his Anaheim Hills 
home, is right on the head scarf of an ancient landslide. Part of his home has 
already shifted, and experts say the foundation has the potential to slide 12 
feet in a minute. 
</P>
<P>
 That's great come property assessment time, but it makes for precarious 
living. Springmeier says he sleeps near a door, but he continues working every 
day on his trains, which he hopes to have completed by summer. It's a 
mind-boggling work, and, tremors permitting, look for a follow-up story when 
he's finished. 
</P>
<P>
 My favorite dreams-to-riches story of the year is Gordon McClelland, who grew 
up in Orange when it was still full of orange orchards. Before he was in his 
teens, he was working in the packing plants, where he fell in love with the 
colorful fruit-box labels. He began collecting them and borrowed from their 
style when he was creating psychedelic rock-poster art in the late '60s. Now he 
has a flourishing business as the foremost expert and dealer of the highly 
collectible labels. 
</P>
<P>
 His was the first of a run of Fixations the past year that I look on as the 
California Idyllic series. There were only three subjects, but their lives were 
so rich that to me they captured this region's golden days as a place of rustic 
splendor and infinite possibilities. Where else would it be possible, say, for 
McClelland to have been standing at sunset by Huntington's Golden Bear on the 
Pacific Coast Highway in his dripping wet suit waiting for a ride, only to have 
legendary grizzled blues men John Lee Hooker and Jimmy Reed pull up and have a 
chat? 
</P>
<P>
 We also spoke with Costa Mesa's Bud Browne, who was making surfing movies 
decades before the sport became a sensation in the '60s. Browne has photos of 
times when he was pulling lobsters out of local waters the size of a suit of 
armor breastplate. Now 82, he still bungee jumps and goes white water rafting.  
</P>
<P>
 Then there's Laguna's John Parlette, a sculptor and surfer. He is still able 
to enjoy the rustic Orange County he grew up loving, at least in his small 
corner of it, which is a shack built into a rock overhang in Laguna Canyon. 
From his cave-like digs, he has a commanding view of a still-unsullied part of 
the canyon that more than makes up for his lack of riches and conveniences. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, he told us, "if I should die today it would be with a big smile 
on my face, because of all the beautiful things I've seen. If I was making the 
corporate move to a little office in L.A. every day, I wouldn't have been able 
to catch all those waves or watch the little opal eyes and eel grass and 
critters on the reefs, the leopard sharks, everything you see when the water's 
clear. Those are the memories I have in my brain -- all-star days." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of our subjects' views of heaven are the same, but they all seem to 
share a similar vigor in pursuing their vistas. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Quilter is someone who does lead the corporate life, heading Costa Mesa's 
hi-tech QSC Audio, which just posted a $12-million month. But on weekends, he's 
a mountain man, one of a growing number of folks who like to emulate the rugged 
lifestyles of American frontier folk. Quilter reports that since we wrote about 
him in February, he's worn in and begrimed a new set of brained-tanned 
buckskins. (The hide is actually softened with gushy brains. He didn't buy it 
at Nordstrom.) 
</P>
<P>
 "They won't let me wear it to work anymore," he complained. He does get to 
soil it up more, though, when working with a buddy to build a log cabin in a 
woodsy spot of San Diego County, using only hand tools. They are to the point 
of forging the door hinges. 
</P>
<P>
 We checked on the progress of a few other subjects. Tightrope-walking, 
66-year-old Hendrik de Kanter sent out Christmas cards with a photo of him now 
riding a bicycle on a high-wire. The flamboyant engineer took up the skill at 
age 63 and continues learning new tricks, including roller-skating on the high 
wire that hangs 18 feet above a cactus garden in his Cowan Heights yard. He 
downplays his skills, noting that with the county bankruptcy, "everyone's 
walking a tightrope these days." 
</P>
<P>
 Event crasher extraordinaire Michael Minutoli reports that his list of 
celebrities he's hung out with has expanded to the legal world, having met O.J. 
Simpson defense attorney Robert Shapiro at a recent charity function. 
</P>
<P>
 "His wife was very talkative," Minutoli confided. He also met Frank Sinatra, 
and lived. 
</P>
<P>
 We received a how-I-spent-my-summer letter from one of our favorite Fixations 
of last year, Michele Devulder, a young Orange woman fascinated with graveyards 
and the dead. The letter detailed her visits in France to the graves of Jim 
Morrison, Moliere, Edith Piaf and others. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reached by phone Saturday, she advised, "you have to go to La Pere La Chaise 
Cemetery in Paris. It's huge, and it's so cool. It was musty and damp and dark 
and real old." As at Disneyland, she says, "you have to give yourself at least 
two days to see it." 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, being featured in this column has been a springboard for people. 
Not that they spring very far, mind you, but not everyone has the loftiest 
goals. Josef Rodriguez and his cousin, Alphonso Luna, are massive "I Dream of 
Jeannie" fans. Rodriquez reports that our September feature on the pair gained 
them an audience with "Jeannie" star Barbara Eden. 
</P>
<P>
 "She looks great," Rodriguez enthused. "You can just knock decades off her 
age. She gave us each a hug and a kiss, and that was more than worth all the 
work we've done getting this collection." 
</P>
<P>
 Keep dreaming out there. We'll get to you.

FIGHTING FOR WHAT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO; POLITICS: FEAR OF A DEBT-RIDDEN FUTURE 
IS PROPELLING POLITICALLY MINDED GENERATION XERS TO JOIN THE FISCAL 
CONSERVATIVES' CALL FOR SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Strange bedfellows indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Politically minded Generation Xers have teamed up with older fiscal 
conservatives and even concerned Baby Boomers to promote a '90s version of the 
welfare mom: the golf-cart granny. 
</P>
<P>
 Picture if you will a seventysomething living it up in Palm Beach, Fla., 
cruisin' the greens under the canopy of a golf cart, collecting dividends on 
stocks and interest on bonds and, oh yes, plenty of Social Security too. That's 
the image being fed to the media by some young leaders and like-minded 
politicos. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the symbol, they say, behind a new generation gap that is as wide as 
the 36-plus years that separate GI Generation grandmother from Xer grandson. 
"Today's young are being asked to bear the burden for their grandparents' 
spending," says Richard Thau, director of a New York-based Xer political group 
called Third Millennium. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last thing we want is a generational war," adds Thau, 29. "But in order 
to avoid one, we have to take steps now." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of the GI Generation (born roughly 1901 to 1924) possibly leaving 
debts for Xers (born from about 1961 to 1981) has awakened political youth 
groups in the last year or so. Some call it a "generational transfer of 
wealth." The gripe is that federal "entitlements," a majority of which go to 
retirees, are eating up federal spending. Entitlements include Social Security, 
medical care for retirees and disability insurance for workers.  
</P>
<P>
 "A kid flipping burgers at five bucks an hour still pays the Social Security 
benefits of a retired couple living in Florida with a cash income of $50,000 a 
year and a paid-off mortgage," write Rob Nelson and Jon Cowan in their new 
book, "Revolution X: A Survival Guide for Our Generation" (Penguin). In part, 
the book targets Social Security as a looming problem facing Generation X. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the authors led a demonstration in front of the Washington, D.C., 
headquarters of the American Assn. for Retired Persons. The Xer political group 
they founded, Lead or Leave, was protesting AARP's support for entitlement 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, Nelson and Cowan wrote an opinion piece in The Times decrying the 
lack of under-40 membership on the federal Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement 
and Tax Reform. They called commission members "entitlement warhorses." 
</P>
<P>
 And this fall, Third Millennium released the results of a survey that found 
that more Xers believe in UFOs than believe Social Security will be around when 
they retire. The survey also said that a plurality of Xers -- 42% -- believe 
the AARP "does not care about treading on future generations." 
</P>
<P>
 Even politicians, such as soon-to-be House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), are 
bringing up the prospect of trimming Social Security. The entitlement and tax 
reform commission was set to recommend slashing Social Security, but backed off 
this month. Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.), chairman of the committee, said cuts were 
not "a realistic hope" politically. 
</P>
<P>
 The 33 million-member AARP has fought back with an offering of 
"intergenerational" cooperation, a willingness to support "modest adjustments" 
in Social Security and a rejection of the golf-cart granny image. "Nearly 75% 
of Social Security and Medicare benefits go to households with incomes other 
than Social Security under $20,000 a year," states an opinion piece in the 
AARP's Modern Maturity magazine, although those numbers are disputed by some 
economists. 
</P>
<P>
 Many elders argue that Social Security must keep its promises to their 
generation, that it is fully solvent and that a little tinkering will keep it 
alive for future generations. "It's not going to affect the younger 
generation," says 74-year-old Ann Miller, a North Hollywood resident and a 
member of the AARP's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked real hard, I raised four children," Miller says. "I'm not looking to 
get all I can get at the expense of my children and grandchildren." 
</P>
<P>
 Xers find allies in such groups as Washington's Concord Coalition -- a 
political organization dominated by fiscally conservative Silent Generation 
types (born from about 1925 to 1942) -- and the Dallas-area American Assn. of 
Boomers (for those born roughly 1943 to 1960). Even some GI Generation members 
are joining in. "The youngsters . . . are being screwed here," says 76-year-old 
Lawrence A. Benenson, a retired businessman who contributes money to Third 
Millennium. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the talk of welfare cheats, it's nothing compared to entitlements," 
Benenson says. "Those in my generation are the real welfare cheats." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, D.C.-based Lead or Leave has backed away from granny bashing since 
the AARP protest. "People think this is about our generation versus the 
grandparents," says co-founder Nelson, 30. "But it's going to be 15 or 20 years 
from now -- when the boomers start retiring -- when we are going to have our 
most massive crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Social Security was set up in 1935 as a mandatory trust fund that all workers 
could tap into when they retired. Today, people are living longer, the number 
of workers per retiree has fallen to almost 3 to 1 (from 55 to 1 in 1935), and 
the government has increased payoffs. Nowadays, retirees generally get more out 
of Social Security than they put in. 
</P>
<P>
 A GI Generation worker who retired in 1980 got back his contributions in less 
than three years. "Social Security paid off nicely for the generation that set 
it up," Federal Reserve official Lawrence Lindsey argues in a recent issue of 
Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
 To compensate, and to prepare for the tidal wave of boomer retirements 
beginning around 2011, the government raised taxes and created a special "trust 
fund." Government officials say they have enough money today to meet Social 
Security's commitments until 2036. 
</P>
<P>
 But the federal government is borrowing from that trust fund for today's 
budgets -- and issuing IOUs for tomorrow. Eventually, those IOUs will have to 
be paid in the form of more taxes or cuts in services. Generational historians 
Neil Howe and Bill Strauss call these IOUs "You Owe Thems." "You're going to 
have to pay twice," Nelson says. 
</P>
<P>
 AARP officials say paying off the IOUs is not their problem. "That's a problem 
of balancing the budget," says legislative director John Rother, 47. In fact, 
argues Rother, Social Security is one of few things in the federal government 
that does work. "It's very financially sound," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the group say Social Security is an intergenerational program 
that calls for intergenerational solutions. They support modest tax increases 
and slowing down the growth of payoffs to prolong Social Security's solvency. 
"We're concerned about Generation X," says Miller, a retired advertising 
saleswoman. "We want to do what's fair for them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The young ones have a more radical approach. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Revolution X," Nelson and Cowan argue for a reduction in entitlement 
payments to retirees who earn more than $40,000. Groups such as the Third 
Millennium, the Concord Coalition and the American Assn. of Boomers support 
such "means testing" -- basing benefits more on need. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups argue that too much of the federal budget (an estimated $800 
billion -- more than half) is going to entitlements, and too much of that 
(nearly half, according to some economists) is going to people who make $30,000 
or more a year. Young leaders say this contributes to annual overspending that, 
in turn, contributes to a $4.5-trillion national debt future generations will 
have to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 The AARP says means testing smells of welfare -- and Americans don't like 
welfare. "I think that would be a very dangerous idea that would destroy 
political support for the program," Rother says. 
</P>
<P>
 The mere mention of Social Security reform is controversial. Pundits say 
Social Security is "the third rail of American politics" -- that politicians 
can get zapped by vote-potent seniors for threatening it. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, it took a new generation with nothing to lose politically 
to bring up the issue, says historian Howe, 43 and co-author of the Xer bible 
"13th Gen: Abort, Retry, Ignore, Fail" (Vintage, 1993). "This generation is 
better suited to make the case," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether young people are concerned enough to vote their mind is up in the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you go into a room full of Xers and say, 'How big is entitlement reform to 
you?' no one is going to know what you're talking about," Nelson argues. "A lot 
of young people don't even know what 'entitlements' means."

LIVING LARGE; WE'RE A NATION OBSESSED WITH CALORIES, WAISTLINES AND FIRM 
FANNIES. BUT THE NOTION THAT IT'S OK TO BE BIG IN THE LAND OF LIPOSUCTION AND 
LIQUID DIETS IS GAINING ACCEPTANCE. 
</P>

<P>
 Frances White is not plump. Nor is she stout, stocky, tubby, paunchy or pudgy. 
Frances White is fat. F-a-t. Fat.  
</P>
<P>
 We may speak openly of this because White has accepted her weight. Her goal 
now is to get you to accept it too. 
</P>
<P>
 White, 51, carries 350 pounds on a 5-foot, 8-inch frame. She has always been 
heavy. Destined, she says, to be a large person from birth. She was put on her 
first diet before age 10. Then came thyroid pills, exercise programs and more 
and more diets. 
</P>
<P>
 To her relatives she was an embarrassment. You'll never marry unless you shed 
some pounds, they warned. Her friends were little better, unable to fathom why 
she couldn't slim down. 
</P>
<P>
 At supermarkets, common strangers behaved like food police, criticizing items 
in her shopping cart. And then there were the taunts, the oinks and the stares 
-- society's constant, humiliating reminders that she literally didn't fit in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very painful, being fat in our body-obsessed society," says White, 
membership coordinator for San Francisco's public television station, KQED. 
"There's this cruel perception that we're always eating, that we're all lazy, 
sloppy and sickly. Your life is just miserable unless you find a way to cope." 
</P>
<P>
 Frances White has found a way to cope. She has become a disciple of "fat 
liberation," a promoter of the idea that it's OK to be large in the land of 
liposuction and liquid diets. 
</P>
<P>
 This might seem a heretical notion, considering our culture's obsession with 
firm fannies, no-fat cuisine, waif-like fashion models and the adage that "you 
can't be too rich or too thin." 
</P>
<P>
 But the ideology of fat acceptance is, in fact, finding favor in America -- 
not just among the heavy but also among many health professionals, obesity 
researchers, psychotherapists and civil-rights advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fat people suffer tremendous painful social consequences because of their 
condition," says Dr. Kelly Brownell, director of Yale University Center for 
Eating and Weight Disorders. "We need to relieve them of the blame for their 
excessive weight and promote the message that very few of us can attain 
society's beauty ideal." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the cause received a hearty boost from new findings suggesting 
that some people are genetically predestined to be obese. Researchers at 
Rockefeller University in New York say they have identified a gene responsible 
for secreting proteins that signal the brain when the stomach is full, thus 
indicating that it's time to stop eating. When this gene is defective, the 
signal is not sent or received and obesity results, the scientists believe. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to attend to (obesity) as an organic problem, not a behavioral 
problem," says Rudolph Leibel, a leading obesity researcher at Rockefeller 
University. Losing weight, in other words, is not always a question of 
willpower. 
</P>
<P>
 Government statistics show that 33% of Americans are obese -- defined as more 
than 25% above their ideal body weight. Studies have linked obesity with 
numerous medical ailments, including hypertension, diabetes, certain cancers 
and coronary heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
 But many fat activists -- and a small band of experts -- question such 
studies, contending that researchers have failed to distinguish fat people who 
exercise and eat sensibly from those who don't. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many fat people who lead healthy lifestyles and I believe they are 
at considerably lower risk for these diseases," says Joanne Ikeda, a UC 
Berkeley nutritionist and expert on pediatric obesity. "But the studies don't 
address this question because the scientific community assumes that all fat 
people are lazy gluttons." 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the charge against fatism is the National Assn. to Advance Fat 
Acceptance (NAAFA), a Sacramento-based group founded by a man angered by the 
bigotry his fat wife faced. The organization lobbies for fat-friendly 
legislation, operates a legal research and defense fund and designs educational 
programs to fight "fat phobia" and anti-fat messages in the media. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the group has persuaded greeting-card manufacturers to come 
up with "fat-sensitive" designs and pressured national restaurant chains to 
install wider seating in new outlets. Last summer, members made headlines with 
a demonstration at the White House, where they chided President Clinton -- who 
had been considered an ally because of the flak he took for gaining weight on 
the 1992 campaign trail -- for ignoring fat people in the debate over 
health-care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fat people are becoming empowered," says Sally Smith, NAAFA's executive 
director. "We are coming out of the closet and realizing that you don't have to 
put up with second-class treatment, and you don't have to put your life on hold 
waiting to be thin." 
</P>
<P>
 Support groups and anti-diet organizations are popping up from coast to coast, 
preaching the merits of "size diversity" and fighting the perception that fat 
people could get trim if only they would really try. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe McVoy, a psychologist and eating-disorder specialist in Radford, Va., 
recently formed a network of physicians, dietitians, therapists and others who 
advocate fat acceptance and healthy living for the obese. The Assn. for the 
Health Enrichment of Large People, he says, was born of his frustration at 
seeing his fat patients diet endlessly with no enduring success. 
</P>

 "For the last five decades, we've been telling fat people to lose weight, and 
that once they did, everything would be OK," McVoy says. "Well, dieting as a 
long-term solution doesn't work . . . So we've locked these people in a 
whirlpool of feeling bad because they're fat, and feeling worse because they 
fail at dieting." 
</P>
<P>
 But some are bouncing back in the war against fatism with litigation. More and 
more heavy people have begun to bring claims under the Americans With 
Disabilities Act and other laws. 
</P>
<P>
 A Cookeville, Tenn., woman who sued a movie theater after she was barred from 
bringing her own chair to a showing of "Jurassic Park" recently settled her 
case, receiving a sum her lawyer called "very satisfactory." 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Hollowich, a 400-pound Los Angeles woman, sued Southwest Airlines after 
she was "humiliated" by a ticket agent who allegedly pulled her out of line and 
ordered her to buy a second seat. "It was terribly traumatic, degrading," she 
says. "I was the fat lady who held up the plane." Southwest Airlines spokesman 
Ed Stewart called the charges "totally untrue," adding, "we do everything we 
can to accommodate people of all sizes." 
</P>
<P>
 Other lawsuits have challenged hiring practices and discrimination by 
landlords who reject prospective fat tenants, telling them they might crack the 
floor or break the toilet. "Over the last year, we've seen a dramatic increase 
in these cases," says James Goodman, senior attorney at the Persons With 
Disabilities Law Center in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, legislation that would prohibit employment discrimination on the 
basis of size has recently come before several state legislatures. So far, only 
Michigan has adopted such a law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fat people are the last acceptable targets of bigotry in our country," says 
New York Assemblyman Daniel Feldman, who plans to reintroduce his bill next 
year. "There are widespread, systematic patterns of discrimination against 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Research confirms his assertion. While it has become taboo to insult a 
person's race, gender, sexual orientation or religion, surveys show many people 
think little of mocking the obese. 
</P>
<P>
 Fat people also appear to suffer in virtually all aspects of life, from 
employment to relationships, health care, education and economic status. 
</P>
<P>
 One researcher asked a group of college students who they would be least 
inclined to marry. The obese ranked near the bottom, with the students 
preferring to wed embezzlers, ex-mental patients, cocaine users or shoplifters. 
</P>
<P>
 The question of why fatness is such a stigma is a complex one. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts believe contemporary attitudes are linked to the Puritans, whose 
lifestyle was dominated by control, stoicism and self-denial. Fat people look 
indulgent -- unwilling to hop on the treadmill and do what it takes to get in 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
 As for fat people themselves, many regard their condition as the worst curse 
imaginable. Colleen Rand, a University of Florida obesity researcher, asked 47 
formerly obese people whether they would rather be fat again or suffer some 
other disability. Ninety-one percent said they would rather have a leg 
amputated, while 89% said they would rather be blind. 
</P>
<P>
 The personal stories of fat people echo the scientific data. Gary Raymond, a 
49-year-old San Bernardino resident who has tried countless diets -- plus 
abdominal surgery -- to lose weight, recalls the purchasing manager's job he 
got, and then lost, he says because of his size -- 385 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 For Terry Nicholetti Garrison, a radio advertising saleswoman in Ithaca, N.Y., 
fat prejudice began in adolescence and followed her into the convent, where she 
was forced to wear a corset beneath her habit because her hips were said to 
sway too much when she walked. For five years, she lived with red slash marks 
on her body from the corset's stiff stays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've made over 100 unsuccessful attempts to lose weight -- pills, diuretics, 
amphetamines, every single diet, hypnosis -- and still people tell me that all 
I need is a little willpower," says Garrison, 49, who is 5 feet, 3 inches and 
weighs 210 pounds. "Jesus, Mary and Joseph! If I worked as hard at becoming a 
millionaire as I did at losing weight, I might not be driving an '84 Sentra 
that's rusting away beneath me." 
</P>
<P>
 Fed up with the pursuit of thinness, Garrison and Raymond have decided to 
accept their weight and become torchbearers in the fat liberation movement. 
Raymond is a columnist for a magazine that caters to fat people, and also 
founded a company called Mourtodri, which makes towels for large people. 
Garrison wrote a book, launched a newsletter called "Grace-Full Eating" and, 
with a Cornell University psychology professor, created a self-help group for 
"victims of weight prejudice." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say such groups ignore the medical risks associated with obesity. 
Earlier this month, the nonprofit Institute of Medicine released a report 
showing that obesity-related ailments lead to health care costs of more than 
$70 billion a year. And former Surgeon Gen. C. Everett Koop, launching a new 
campaign urging Americans to "drop a few pounds (and) shape up," says that 
obesity-related conditions are the second-leading cause of death in the United 
States, after smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who endorse the live-and-let-live philosophy of fat activists say 
that acceptance may not be best for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "What our profession needs to do is determine which people should lose weight, 
because of medical complications, and then help them do that," says Brownell of 
Yale's eating disorder center. "Advocating body acceptance for everyone is not 
a defensible position. It would mean accepting a massive public health 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 As the scientific debate continues, fat liberationists say there are signs 
that their message is being heeded. Hollywood, for instance, has taken an 
interest in fat characters who go beyond the traditional comic roles. Last 
year's film "What's Eating Gilbert Grape," for example, featured an obese woman 
who stood up to bigotry and enjoyed her family's loving support. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, 45 million Americans will attempt to lose weight this year, 
according to Marketdata Enterprises, Inc., a New York-based market research 
firm. And thigh cream, tummy tucks, liposuction and other forms of plastic 
surgery are more popular than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's slow going," says Frances White, president of NAAFA. "But at least now 
people are talking about size acceptance. And a lot of fat people are realizing 
they don't have to hide from the world."

SUPER-HEROES WITH GOOD TASTE; FRUITS AND VEGETABLES SQUARE OFF AGAINST JUNK 
FOOD AND CIGARETTES IN A COMIC BOOK FOR HUNGRY MINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Is a tomato a fruit or vegetable? 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, it's one of five super-heroes in the Snak Posse comic book, the 
brainchild of Robert Orchanian, a Merrill Lynch financial consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of SNAK (Super Nutritionally Active Kids) is to encourage kids to 
love the foods they typically hate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try not to be fanatics," says Orchanian, the comic book's publisher and 
editor. "With Snak Posse we try to get kids to eat healthy. We put a balance on 
that. If kids want to go to McDonald's that's fine -- occasionally. Not just 
every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Snak Posse's fruit and veggie super-heroes -- Flash Carotene, Blush the 
Tomato, Silky Stalker celery, the Kernel and Banana Bolt -- aim to show 
youngsters that nutritional foods are cool. They also take on villainous junk 
food, soda pop and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the hooligans are camels, which happen to smoke and beat up on folks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put smoking as the bad guys and we know we're right. Cigarette companies 
don't worry us," says Orchanian, 40, who launched the comic in June from his 
home in Yorktown Heights, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 The stories are full of zap-pow-bam action with sophisticated writing and 
lively drawings. The messages are subtle. No homilies. No finger wagging. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids are smart," says Denny Fincke, chief artist. "They don't like being 
preached to, so we have to be very good in executing the comic in a way that 
doesn't insult their intelligence." For example, in one panel Blush the Tomato 
(a fruit, by the way), is shown lifting dumbbells while talking with her chums. 
She could have been shown carrying on about the benefits of exercise, but 
instead her workout is an aside. 
</P>
<P>
 "We build education into the super-heroes. The kids are learning and they 
don't even know it at the time," Orchanian says. "People have this built-in 
prejudice about what kids like or don't like. If you present good-tasting 
carrots, they'll definitely eat them and enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Orchanian had kicked around the comic book idea for about a year before its 
premiere. He and his wife, Dolores, were already prone to healthy living. 
</P>
<P>
 So with family blessings and savings, Orchanian ran newspaper ads in search of 
a staff. He also tapped on family talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert and Dolores (she's an aerobics instructor and nutrition consultant) are 
the editors. Their five children, ages 5 to 22, have some say in the comic's 
creation from color choices to character development. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a seven-person focus group running around my house all the time," 
Orchanian says. Dolores' sister-in-law, Susan Mormile, a calligrapher in 
Florida, N.Y., is the letterer -- the person who handprints the dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 Orchanian recalls interviewing Fincke, who had answered the ad for an artist. 
Fincke didn't have a car, so Orchanian offered to pick him up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Denny jumped into my broken-down Honda, which kept stalling out, and I kept 
driving around in the wrong direction, while I'm telling Denny about 
super-heroes who are vegetables and fruits. Denny probably thought I was nuts," 
Orchanian says with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 So nuts that Fincke joined up as main artist and brought along his friend 
April Mosen, also an artist. 
</P>
<P>
 The story-line writer is David Pettigrew, a New Jersey dentist. 
</P>
<P>
 After office hours, Orchanian, Fincke and Pettigrew would hole up in his 
reception room where they worked on the story, oftentimes until midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best comics are when writer and artist work together," Fincke says. 
"Also, our secret is we often ate pizza, double cheese topping. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rob is a visionary. He's very focused . . . like Flash. He sees the big 
picture." 
</P>
<P>
 Orchanian and Fincke have also done their share of grunt work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to go up to the Canadian border (where the comic is printed) to pick 
up the first book," Fincke says. "We got up at Rob time -- 6 a.m. -- and rented 
a van. The only tape Rob would play was the Righteous Brothers. That's 10 hours 
of the Righteous Brothers. At least we got engrossed in the next story and I 
was able to block out the music." 
</P>
<P>
 Last Halloween Fincke wore a Banana Bolt costume to a health food store where 
he handed out Snak Posse. He nearly passed out from suffocation. 
</P>
<P>
 Orchanian and Fincke have also worked the comic conventions, including one in 
San Diego where they met 13-year-old Alex Cahill, a big fan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rest of the comics have too much blood," Alex says. "You can have a good 
comic with a good story and action and you don't need gore. This comic goes 
beyond originality. It has a whole bunch of good messages. . . . Most comic 
characters don't have much personality. The Kernel does. And I like Banana 
Bolt, too, because of his amazing ability to use the potassium beam." 
</P>
<P>
 Orchanian still does the daily 30-minute commute to his Merrill Lynch office 
in Mt. Kisco. Along the way he says he thinks about how he would "love to do 
the comic full-time and develop the characters even beyond comic books to a 
computer game or maybe a movie." 
</P>
<P>
 * Until Hollywood catches on, you can order the comic book ($1.95) by writing 
to HCOM Inc., 3198 Quinlan St., Yorktown Heights, N.Y. 10598, or by calling 
(914) 962-0878.

BODY WATCH; A PRE-MAMMOGRAPHY 'PRIMER'; HEALTH: THERE ARE SOME THINGS YOU

WEAR NICE SHOES. OH, AND TONE UP.

<P>
 It's not the first time they've led you into the unknown. Remember your 
surprise when they got in the way of your batting swing? Threw off your 
balance? Went so far as to demand their own specialized undergarment? 
</P>
<P>
 Whether you were ready or not, your breasts pointed the way toward puberty. 
</P>
<P>
 Now you're on the brink of middle age and -- ready or not -- you and your 
breasts are once more entering unfamiliar territory: It's time for a mammogram. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing scary about the procedure. In fact, it can be a lifesaver. But 
as somewhat of a mammogram veteran, I've learned there are a few basics your 
doctor will neglect to mention. 
</P>
<P>
 (I've glossed over some of the finer points by avoiding expressions like 
"vise-like grip" and omitting a description of the sensation of having your 
breast wrenched from your chest wall. But as any health-care professional will 
tell you, it doesn't really hurt -- you're just experiencing some discomfort.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before you show up for the appointment, I'd recommend you brush up on your 
fashion sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite your mother's warnings, it doesn't matter what underwear you choose. 
No health-care professional will know that your bra strap is held up by a 
safety pin because you'll almost immediately trade your bra for a hospital 
gown, below which your street clothes will peek entertainingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Any impression you make rests with your fishnets and cowboy boots. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the poses you'll strike are only vaguely pornographic, they are 
decidedly acrobatic, so consider a few upper body stretches before your 
appointment. You'll be glad you did when the technician asks you to bring your 
left hand forward, palm up, while turning to the side and embracing the giant 
X-ray machine with your free arm. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also a good idea to increase your aerobic capacity with some 
pre-mammogram conditioning because once that spunky technician has you in 
position and disappears behind that radiation shield, she'll yell out, "Now, 
don't breathe!" 
</P>
<P>
 Remember that while doing all this, you're the filling in a photographic 
breast sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
 Yikes! may be your initial reaction as you imagine your breast spread flat 
beneath the glass plate, but relax. The experience is more surrealistic than 
painful. Bring to mind Dali's watch: You're about to see an intimate part of 
your anatomy from a whole new perspective. Persistence of Mammary, if you will. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Funky sandals and all, I was more than ready for my second routine foray into 
the world of mammography. Still, the experience was not entirely glitch-free. 
</P>
<P>
 At my clinic, once the X-rays are read, the nurse gives you the all clear and 
directs you back to the dressing room. Or, rarely, the doctor solemnly appears 
and ushers you into his office. It's obvious which way you want it to go. 
</P>
<P>
 As I waited, I noticed women being released who had come in after me. My first 
response was annoyance: Hey, I was here first! But in that kind of situation, 
it's hard to hold on to pettiness. Your goal is anxiety, as in, Ohmigod, what's 
wrong?  
</P>
<P>
 I was fleshing out my movie-of-the-week scenario when the nurse finally came 
for me. Unfortunately, she failed to utter the magic words. Instead she said, 
"I'd like you to step across the hall to meet Dr. So-and-So." 
</P>
<P>
 I don't remember his name because at that point most of my circuits shorted 
out. The only part of my brain that seemed to be working kept chanting the 
mantra: Don'tcrydon'tcry . I can see myself standing in the ghostly 
backlighting of my X-rayed breasts. I am shaking hands with Dr. So-and-So, and 
being introduced to his colleague, Dr. Something-or-Other. The mantra changes: 
Gettoit!Gettoit!  
</P>
<P>
 They are thanking me for having my original base-line mammographs sent to them 
( Gettoitgettoit! ), they are explaining how much easier it makes their 
diagnosis ( Gettoitgettoit! ), they are telling me that my breasts are 
perfectly . . . normal. 
</P>
<P>
 What???  
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, keen fashion sense, aerobic conditioning and the artist's eye 
only go so far. The one thing you really need when you go for your mammogram is 
a way of fast forwarding to "everything is fine." 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Get Tested Regularly 
</P>
<P>
 The American Cancer Society recommends that women have a mammogram done 
starting at age 40. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the finding, the test should be conducted every one to two years 
for women ages 40-49. Women older than 50 should have mammograms done annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Cancer Society also recommends self-breast exams starting at age 
20, and a breast examination by a health-care professional every three years 
until age 40.

TIDBITS; NUTRITIOUS DINING FOR SINGLE APPETITES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You eat a light lunch and get home late from work. You're tired and famished, 
so you grab dinner -- cheese, crackers and a couple of glasses of wine.And 
since you live alone and nobody's looking . . . well, what the heck, why not 
polish off the pint of Cherry Garcia? 
</P>
<P>
 Many people who live by themselves find it difficult to shop, cook and pay 
attention to good nutrition. As a result, they have the tendency to overeat. 
Here are some quick tips for healthier eating: 
</P>
<P>
 * Plan ahead. Do a weekly shopping trip. 
</P>
<P>
 * Have a snack late in the afternoon. If you eat lunch between noon and 1:30, 
no wonder you're starving by dinner time. Eat a piece of fruit just before you 
leave work. Then you won't walk in the house hungry enough to eat the rugs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Control portions of carryout and delivery food. Out of sight, out of mind. 
Before you eat the whole pizza, freeze half of it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Explore foods that are perfect for one serving. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eat breakfast for dinner. There's nothing wrong with having cereal and fruit 
for dinner.

GOING ALONG FOR THE RIDE IN 'TAXICAB CONFESSIONS'; TELEVISION: THE GANTZ 
BROTHERS' DOCUMENTARIES DETAIL THE EMOTIONAL LIVES OF ORDINARY AMERICANS. THEIR 
LATEST PREMIERES JAN. 14 ON HBO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Gantz brothers were at it again -- hunkered down in the back of a 
surveillance van, cruising the mean streets of Manhattan at the craziest hours, 
eavesdropping on the bizarre conversations of New York City cab drivers and 
their customers. 
</P>
<P>
 They aren't cops, but nosy independent filmmakers from Woodland Hills in 
search of some arresting turf for their latest in-your-face documentary: This 
time, they want to explore the often outrageous scenarios involving taxicab 
passengers alone with a driver in the middle of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Gantzes rigged a cab with five cigarette-sized cameras and hit the 
road. Over one month, they monitored the discourse of 550 fares from the 
trailing van, prompting drivers through an earphone -- and acquiring permission 
for the footage after the ride was over. 
</P>
<P>
 Their hourlong documentary, "Taxicab Confessions," premiering Jan. 14 on HBO, 
is a riveting look at nearly a dozen random New Yorkers who use the cab as a 
confessional to describe their unique vision of the world: 
</P>
<P>
 There's the nonplussed cop describing ways he has seen people die; the tipsy 
lesbian who makes a pass at her female driver. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the crack-addicted prostitute who talks about the painful rejection by 
her father; the sadly glib transsexual; the druggie dude who details how he 
beat a man for stealing money from a friend's funeral fund. 
</P>
<P>
 And the aged violinist playing requests there in the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't a cab, it's a stage. Or a psychologist's couch. And that's exactly 
what Joe and Harry Gantz had in mind. "The taxicab was the perfect environment 
to catch the randomness of life -- because you never knew who was going to hop 
in next," Joe Gantz said. "They're in a safe environment with a person who -- 
chances are -- you're never going to see again. There's no eye contact unless 
it's a glimpse through a rear-view mirror. So, in that way, it became like a 
confessional." 
</P>
<P>
 Call them America's Peeping Toms: The two sons of a Cincinnati trucking 
company owner are pointing the camera at real people in situations never before 
documented -- all without the artificial adrenaline rush of "Cops" and "Rescue 
911" or the titillation of talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "What interests us is finding out where people live in their emotional lives, 
finding where their deepest and strongest feelings lie and somehow getting a 
sense of that," said the 36-year-old Harry Gantz. "A lot of what we do is a 
reaction to how television usually deals with a subject. We go after what we 
find missing, the things television isn't doing." 
</P>
<P>
 For their 1980s documentary "Couples Arguing," the pair were on call 24 hours 
a day for three months. When a participating couple began to argue, they called 
the crew and waited in separate rooms until the filmmakers arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Search of Love and Fame" -- a reality-series pilot the Gantzes made in 
1990 -- focused on the personal crises and professional triumphs of eight 
upstart performers -- from actors to dancers to directors -- trying to make it 
in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 In their 1989 television talk-show pilot "A Life at Random," the Gantzes 
featured interviews with people talking about private moments. To locate 
potential personalities, the host spun a roulette wheel representing all 50 
states, then threw a dart at the map of the state to find a city. Finally, 
using a phone book from that locale, he closed his eyes and placed his finger 
on the name of the guest. The television pilots for "A Life at Random" and "In 
Search of Love and Fame" are still collecting dust. "Couples Arguing" made it 
to PBS -- after the Gantzes shelled out their own money to promote it. 
</P>
<P>
 That frustrates the brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe always says television is like a huge river," Harry says. "It's hard to 
change the flow just a teeny bit, to go out of the mainstream. Cable TV was 
supposed to change all that. But it's not doing the job." 
</P>
<P>
 It was 10 years ago, while on a skiing vacation in Vermont, that the Gantzes 
decided to take on television as they knew it. Both were struggling artists: 
Harry, an Off Broadway actor and director, and Joe, a writer and photographer 
who was then living in Paris, decided to make a documentary film about 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who's been in a committed relationship knows that arguments are 
inevitable," says Joe, 40. "And on television, arguments were either treated as 
a joke or they erupted into dramatic violence. But the truth is, most people 
don't kill each other when they argue." 
</P>
<P>
 So they placed newspapers ads and posted bills in therapy offices in the Bay 
Area, receiving more than 100 responses. They settled on six couples who -- for 
no pay or compensation -- allowed a camera to invade their kitchens and 
bedrooms. "Many had tried therapy," Harry Gantz said, "and felt that maybe by 
bringing in a crew and seeing the tapes, they could shed a new light on their 
relationships." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, a pattern emerged: Most fights were over money, drinking and sex. "After 
awhile, you recognized the same circle of argument," Joe Gantz says. "They 
might start for different reasons, but they always ended up with the same 
topics." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, however, the brothers ran out of money making "Couples Arguing," 
finishing with funding from Channel 4 in England, which premiered the 
documentary. Sneaking into a European television convention, they sold the film 
to stations in Germany, France and the Netherlands.  
</P>
<P>
 Like their previous films, "Taxicab Confessions" contains powerful moments, 
such as the homeless man who says, "I'm telling you the truth: When I go to 
sleep, I hope I don't wake up." 
</P>
<P>
 With "Taxicab Confessions" ready to air, the Gantzes are waiting for 
television to come calling, and taking precautions to preserve unaired tapes. 
During last year's Malibu fires, Joe kept the videos in a 14-foot rental van, 
ready to roll if the flames came too close. "People don't realize," Harry said, 
"our whole life is in those tapes."

NOT SO 'LITTLE WOMEN'; MOVIES: 'WE WORRY ABOUT THIS BEING PORTRAYED AS A 
FEMINIST FILM -- OF COURSE IT IS THAT, BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHER THINGS IN IT AS 
WELL,' SAYS DIRECTOR GILLIAN ARMSTRONG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINE McKENNA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Agreed it's an obvious take, but Australian director Gillian Armstrong's 
remake of Louisa May Alcott's 1868 classic, "Little Women," fairly begs for a 
feminist reading. 
</P>
<P>
 What does the film reveal about how women have changed in the 126 years since 
the book was written? What sort of evolution has taken place since George Cukor 
directed his version of the book in 1933? What aspects of this family's 
decidedly American lives still speak to us today? 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting at a Beverly Hills hotel with Armstrong; Denise Di Novi, who produced 
the film, and Robin Swicord, who wrote the screenplay, one encounters a trio 
who groan in unison at the mention of "feminism." 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong has a particular aversion to the label, as it's something she's been 
trying to transcend since 1979 when her debut picture, "My Brilliant Career," 
led to her being branded as a maker of women's films. A turn-of-the-century 
tale of a young Australian girl who spurns her handsome suitor for the sake of 
her writing career, "My Brilliant Career" revolves around a heroine much like 
"Little Women's" Jo March. 
</P>
<P>
 The similarity between the two characters gave Armstrong pause -- in fact, she 
initially declined to do the film, which has proved to be one of the critical 
hits of this Christmas season, for that very reason. Once she passed that 
hurdle and signed on to do the film, which stars Winona Ryder, Susan Sarandon, 
Trini Alvarado and Claire Danes, she came up against the daunting realization 
that she was a foreigner taking on an American classic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing I did after agreeing to do it was read the entire history of 
the Civil War -- I needed to know what was going on in America at the time!" 
says Armstrong of the film, which was completed last summer during an 11-week 
shoot in Vancouver, British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong's interest in the realities of 19th-Century American life, and 
Louisa May Alcott's place in it, led to what could be described as a 
politically correct "Little Women." 
</P>
<P>
 Her film is rife with allusions to issues of class and race that are 
altogether missing from Cukor's film. (Anyone who thinks Cukor's peaches 'n' 
cream version is a classic that cannot be improved obviously hasn't seen it 
lately; the redoubtable Katharine Hepburn plays Jo March in a manner alarmingly 
reminiscent of Marjorie Main's Ma Kettle.) 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, one of the most intriguing things about Armstrong's film is the wealth 
of information it presents about the Alcott family, which served as a model for 
the Marches of "Little Women." 
</P>
<P>
 The daughter of philosopher and educator Amos Bronson Alcott, Louisa May grew 
up in the center of New England's Transcendentalist Movement, receiving private 
tutoring as a child from family friends Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David 
Thoreau. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Radically progressive in its day, Transcendentalism espoused the values of 
equal rights, education for all, self-reliance and charity work. In an effort 
to highlight Alcott's philosophy, screenwriter Swicord embroidered her "Little 
Women" with bits and pieces not in the book, but drawn from Alcott's life. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have told me I'm a '90s feminist putting words in the mouths of these 
fictional characters, but the things brought to the foreground in our film are 
there in the book. You have to know what you're looking at to see them though, 
because they're not at an expositional level," says Swicord, who watched the 
previous versions of "Little Women" in preparing to write her script. 
</P>
<P>
 (Armstrong's is the sixth attempt to bring "Little Women" to the screen; there 
was a silent version, the Cukor film of 1933, a version starring Shirley Temple 
that was never released, Mervyn Le Roy's 1949 film that starred June Allyson, 
and a 1978 TV version that altered some of the book's key plot points and spun 
off into a short-lived series.) 
</P>
<P>
 "For instance, you know the mother goes to work at a place called the Rooms, 
but you don't know she was the first social worker in Massachusetts," Swicord 
says. "You know the family doesn't follow one religion and that they believe 
they have a responsibility to improve themselves. It's suggested throughout the 
book that the mother is a homeopathic practitioner, so we tried to underscore 
that -- 19th-Century women were barred from most medical schools, so many of 
them went into homeopathic medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then there's an episode where one of the girls is struck at school and the 
mother decides to educate her at home; corporal punishment was the rule in the 
19th Century, but the Transcendentalists opposed it. There's also an allusion 
to the fact that the school the father runs is shut down because he allows a 
dark-skinned person to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alcott put these things between the lines of the book because if they'd been 
openly addressed, she probably wouldn't have been able to get it published," 
Swicord adds. "I tried to write the film as I imagined she would have written 
it today, freed of the cultural restraints of the time she lived in." 
</P>
<P>
 To play devil's advocate, one points out that although their film is an 
enlightened version, it could be described as a story about pretty girls who 
get married; where's the feminism in that?  
</P>
<P>
 The question obviously hits a tender spot with the women, all of whom are 
married and have children. (Armstrong has daughters age 9 and 6, Di Novi has a 
4-year-old son and Swicord has daughters age 8 and 11.) 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the most radical things about 'My Brilliant Career' was that it 
concludes with the heroine refusing to marry the handsome hero," an irritated 
Armstrong says. "It was important to make that statement at the time, but 
contrary to what it suggests, I don't think feminism is about refusing to marry 
and have children." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Di Novi: "Comparing the ending of 'My Brilliant Career' with the ending 
of our film is indicative of how feminism has evolved. This film is grounded in 
an evolved kind of feminism -- which is funny, considering how long ago the 
book was written. I think we're evolving into a more humanist and inclusive 
feminism that's able to embrace men and motherhood in a way '60s feminism 
couldn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong: "I'm reluctant to say the word out loud because it's come to be 
such a terrible turn-off, but feminism is now able to be less strident because 
we've actually made some gains and can relax a bit; nonetheless, there are 
still terrible fears about it. You wouldn't believe the number of male 
journalists who ask me questions like, 'So, you make these women's films -- I 
assume you'd prefer to have a woman cinematographer?' I tell them I'm not a 
separatist and I love men -- in fact, I'm married to one! Feminism has had 
irreparable amounts of bad press that has led men to assume it's about women 
rejecting men. Consequently, we worry about this being portrayed as a feminist 
film -- of course it is that, but there are many other things in it as well." 
</P>
<P>
 "Marriage was an unavoidable economic reality in that time," Di Novi says. 
"Louisa attempted to create a male character who didn't compromise Jo and 
respected her mind, and I hope the film leaves you with the feeling that Jo 
will continue to write, and that she and her husband will share a life together 
as equals. One of the things I love about the relationship between Jo and 
Professor Bhaer (played by Gabriel Byrne) is that it begins in friendship and 
develops from there. Those are the marriages that work and we rarely see them 
in movies. They prefer to present fantasies because it's simpler, and the 
industry knows fantasies make money." 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong adds, "We have to demystify the idea that there's a prince who comes 
along and solves your life. One of the most important things to teach our 
daughters is that they may grow up and be on their own, so they should be able 
to look after themselves. My parents had a strong belief in equal education for 
women -- nonetheless, my mother still always wanted me to have a white wedding 
someday," she adds with a laugh. "I tell her there are no weddings in our 
family, but there are premieres." 
</P>
<P>
 But what about the beautiful Winona Ryder cast as Jo March, who describes 
herself in the book as being decidedly plain, if not homely? 
</P>
<P>
 " Every adolescent girl looks in the mirror and feels unsatisfied, simply 
because women are conditioned to respond to themselves that way," Armstrong 
says. "One of the unpleasant parts of female adolescence is the realization 
that your life will depend to an extent on how you look -- it's a terrible 
pressure and most of us are never happy with our physical attributes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, Winona is one of the most beautiful women in America, but surrounded by 
the heart-shaped faces of Trini Alvarado and Kirsten Dunst, who have a 
traditional Victorian beauty, Winona does look a bit scrawny. Beyond that, it's 
never said that Jo is ugly -- it's more to do with the fact that she doesn't 
fit and doesn't care about how she looks." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the politics of Armstrong's "Little Women" are rooted in reality in a 
way previous film versions were not, the family life it depicts read as pure 
fiction in the 1990s, when dysfunctional families are the norm. Di Novi agrees 
that "most people today don't have the kind of nurturing family life central to 
this story -- and that's one of the reasons films like this are necessary. The 
film suggests that you can be a flawed human being with troubled relationships, 
yet still honor the bond of family. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's complicated to figure out what's caused the breakdown in parenting we're 
experiencing," she adds, "but a quote I heard that makes sense is that, 'It 
takes a village to raise a child,' and there's no village anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Swicord differs, adding: "We should guard against the impulse to romanticize 
19th-Century parenting. Kids were routinely hit in school, and there was much 
less concern about who got an education then. Moreover, the Marches are not a 
perfect family. Beth was probably mentally ill, although we don't know to what 
extent -- we do know she was agoraphobic. Marmee is basically a single mother 
and the family is very poor." (The Marches may have been poor, but to live 
today with the rustic charm they enjoyed you must be wealthy enough to afford 
Ralph Lauren, who's done a bang-up job of marketing faux poverty.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The girls have their battles, too -- you see Jo sulking at her sister's 
wedding, for instance. Young women tend to read this book during the years when 
they're separating from their mothers and are beginning to see them as 
imperfect, and one of the wonderful things Susan Sarandon brought to the role 
is that she allows us to see how she could be idealized, but we also see she's 
no different from any woman in terms of how she has to struggle in the world 
and deal with her kids. You see she's not a saint." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're working against the image this book has developed over time," Armstrong 
says. "People assume it's sweet and old-fashioned, but this is not a cute 
little movie for little girls. Yes, it is a film about Louisa May Alcott's 
thoughts on very intimate parts of a woman's life -- adolescence and finding 
first love -- and I'm pleased at the prospect of young girls being exposed to 
those thoughts. But there's much, much more to the book, and I'll be even more 
pleased if men discover there's something there for them too."

RATHER'S STORIES BEHIND THE STORIES; TELEVISION: 'I'M A REPORTER. I JUST DON'T 
PLAY ONE ON TV,' SAYS THE CBS NEWSMAN, WHOSE LATEST BOOK IS 'THE CAMERA NEVER 
BLINKS TWICE.'

<P>
 Oh, Dan. 
</P>
<P>
 Another book? Your second in two years. Fourth in your career. Maybe a couple 
more in the works. The words, the volumes, the memories. They just keep pouring 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 As a foolish king once said to Edward Gibbon, author of the voluminous 
"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire," it's always scribble, scribble, 
scribble, eh, Mr. Gibbon? 
</P>
<P>
 With Dan Rather, it's always peck, peck, peck, eh, Mr. Rather? (He knocks out 
his books on a crusty old Royal in his office.) 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Rather: anchorman, reporter, author . . . roles, it would appear, that he 
assumes with equal vigor. In recent weeks, the anchorman has spearheaded a 
publicity blitz for "The Camera Never Blinks Twice," the second volume of what 
someday could be a trilogy. Despite the interviews, talk shows and book 
signings, the book has yet to show up on any national bestseller lists. Still, 
publisher William Morrow says it has been a great success -- but declined to 
provide sales figures. 
</P>
<P>
 One may reasonably ask: Doesn't this man have enough to do already? Responds 
Rather: "I like to write and I like the feeling of having accomplished a book." 
Of course, it's not all that simple. Rather is a compulsive memoirist who feels 
a need to come to terms with his past. And he certainly has a rich past -- 
brilliant, controversial, and at times bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twice" picks up where "The Camera Never Blinks" leaves off. (Rather wrote 
both with help by veteran ghost writer Mickey Herskowitz.) Like that surprise 
1976 bestseller, this one's filled with colorful tales of a globe-trotting 
newsman who has reported from some of the world's hot spots of the last two 
decades. Perhaps mindful that some readers might accuse him of taking full 
credit for some of his reportorial triumphs, Rather also has published a 
13-page addendum naming hundreds of CBS staff members who helped him along the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, 63, does discuss the contentious 1988 interview with candidate George 
Bush and the six-minute walk-out on a set in Miami, but unfortunately, reveals 
little that was not already known. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather's "sanctum sanctorum" at CBS News headquarters on West 57th Street in 
Manhattan looks as if it could easily be a writer's warren. It is a dark, 
brooding, masculine place that is only dimly illuminated by the glare of stage 
lights from the newsroom below. Books are scattered about and a visitor has the 
distinct impression that if Hemingway had decorated this office, he, too, would 
have selected that rich brown leather couch or that fine oak desk. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent day, Rather himself seemed unusually subdued -- perhaps ground 
down by the demands of the book tour, or disappointed by the relegation of his 
cherished "48 Hours" to the worst time period on TV, Thursdays at 10 p.m. (He 
admits to being "stunned" by the move.) 
</P>
<P>
 But unhappy? No way, says the anchorman. "This year has been among the most 
satisfying years I've had in the business," he says quite convincingly. "And I 
still think my best year is ahead of me." 
</P>
<P>
 He cites a triumphant reporting trip to Haiti (he scooped his fellow anchors 
by landing an interview with strongman Raoul Cedras). He cites improved ratings 
for "Evening News" (indeed, it is livelier and has been in second place all 
fall). 
</P>
<P>
 And he cites a fine working relationship with co-anchor Connie Chung. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes. Chung. There has been a pervasive sense at CBS News that Rather has 
chafed under the arrangement, but he is quick to disabuse an interviewer of 
that notion: "I was happy and I am happy (with the dual anchor). I am here to 
speak up for Connie. I believe in her: I did yesterday, do today and will 
tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 And in case lingering doubt remains, he adds, with emphasis, "You won't hear a 
critical word out of my mouth about (the dual anchor format), no way, no how, 
no shape, no form." 
</P>
<P>
 But if 1994 has been Rather's year to beat all years, the book -- more than 
anything -- is the reason. Will Schwalbe, editorial director of Morrow, says 
that a big factor in its success has been Rather himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been extraordinary about promoting it," Schwalbe says. "He's agreed to 
do absolutely anything that we wanted him to, which is incredibly rare for a 
celebrity author." 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, there's a lot at stake in this book for Rather. A couple of years 
ago, he wrote one about his youth titled "I Remember," which was, to put it 
charitably, a flop. He hadn't expected a bestseller, but it was a keen 
disappointment because his earlier efforts, especially "The Palace Guard" 
(about the Nixon White House, co-written with Gary Paul Gates) were winners. 
</P>
<P>
 But one suspects something more than pride is behind Rather's motivation for 
making "Twice" a winner. For much of the past 13 years since he succeeded 
Walter Cronkite, Rather has been victimized by some of the most stunningly 
negative press that a leading anchorman has ever been subjected to. And how 
does Rather respond? With the exception of Bush-Miami, he does not. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, "Twice" is suffused with a "Forrest Gump"-like theme: If you work 
hard enough, your intentions are pure and your mistakes are honest, then your 
enemies will be vanquished. 
</P>
<P>
 As such, "Twice" -- perhaps unwittingly -- emerges as an apologia for a 
brilliant career. The good-guy reporter (Rather) always gets his story and the 
bad guy (if he is even mentioned) is flummoxed by the forces of good. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather pointedly denies that "Twice" is a public-relations effort designed to 
polish, or even rehabilitate, his career. "There is no myth-making with Dan 
Rather," he says. "In television, you're either good or you're gone, and you 
either do or you don't. I've been on television most of the second half of the 
20th Century. There is no place to hide, and I don't want there to be." 
</P>
<P>
 He says he has been a lightning rod over the years because "one, I work for 
CBS News, and two, I've been lucky enough and God has blessed me tremendously 
so that I've been at or near the top a long time. And three, I don't do it the 
way other people do it. I'm a reporter. I just don't play one on TV. Some 
people can't understand that. Some people think they understand it, and it 
makes them insecure." 
</P>
<P>
 If a third volume is ever published, Rather may one day write his own epitaph. 
And what will it say? "I think that part of the book on Dan Rather has to say, 
'What's the record?' Has he done it perfectly? No. Has he made mistakes? Yes. 
Has he been dependable? Yes. Has he been durable? Yes." 
</P>
<P>
 And could anyone argue with that self-evaluation? No.

FORGET THE WESTSIDE -- TRY STAR-GAZING IN TOLUCA HILLS; CELEBRITIES: OAKWOOD 
APARTMENT UNITS ARE SO POPULAR WITH THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY THAT COMPANY 
OFFICIALS OFFER PERFORMERS SPECIAL DEALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Unlike tourists who flock to the boulevard of footprints, Angelenos know that 
celebrities don't really live or hang out in Hollywood. Better places to spot 
famous faces include Santa Monica's Montana Avenue, the Century City or Beverly 
Center malls, Jerry's Deli in Studio City or maybe even Cedars-Sinai Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 But a good bet to catch a gaggle of celebs is a small enclave in Los Angeles 
known as the Toluca Hills Oakwood Apartments on Barham Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a very selective list of residents can be pretty comprehensive. Among 
those who have called it home: Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson, Ossie Davis 
and Ruby Dee, Dean Stockwell, Lou Gossett Jr., Mary Wells, Kim Novak, Queen 
Latifah and Neil Patrick Harris, as well as cast and crew members of "Forrest 
Gump," the "Batman" movies, "Under Siege 2," "Regarding Henry," both "Sister 
Act" movies, the "Star Trek" movies, the "Beverly Hills Cop" movies, "Sleeping 
With the Enemy," "What's Love Got to Do With It," "Puppet Master" and 
Paramount's upcoming "Congo." Theater groups that have resided there include 
the cast and crew of "Phantom of the Opera," "The Secret Garden," "Les 
Miserables," "Grand Hotel," "Tommy," "Jesus Christ Superstar," "Crazy for You" 
and "Annie." 
</P>
<P>
 The apartments are so popular with the entertainment industry, that Oakwood -- 
a corporate-housing company with units in 400 cities -- offers performers 
special deals, courtesy of its entertainment sales representative, Joni 
Rodenbusch. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 years ago, Oakwood managers realized the now 28-year-old Toluca Hills 
location was getting fewer corporate clients, but more from the movie, 
television and music industries. "We're centrally located to all the majors," 
Rodenbusch explains. "We're right near Universal, Disney, Warner Bros., NBC and 
we're eight minutes from Paramount." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Oakwood -- now nearly 80% show-biz folk -- "started focusing 
completely on entertainment," Rodenbusch says from her office, with its 
celebrity-photo-covered walls. (She's one of the non-industry residents.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Through pretty much word-of-mouth, it became a popular place to live," 
Rodenbusch says. People, she says, are drawn to Oakwood's two pools, two 
Jacuzzis, tennis courts, basketball court, two fitness centers, dry cleaner, 
hair salon, convenience store, conference room, clubhouse, Hertz car rental 
office, Sunday brunch and what may be the biggest draw, a rehearsal hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It became apparent we needed to do something to capture more of that 
specialized market," Rodenbusch says. "We began offering a special 
entertainment rate." 
</P>
<P>
 Once she is contacted by production managers, line producers, production 
coordinators, tour managers and theater-company managers, Rodenbusch sets up 
clients in housing for anywhere from a day to three months or more. Rates, she 
points out, are "like airline tickets, we have so many different discounts and 
specials, it can be different each day." (The few long-term, full-time 
apartments are in the $650 to $950 range.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, you're looking at actors and actresses who are working on a 
project or musicians working on an album who don't want the expense of a hotel 
and the lack of security, where anyone can walk into a hotel lobby," she says. 
Oakwood boasts a guard in a kiosk at its entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 So when someone who's a long-term resident says, "Wow, that looked like Alice 
Cooper," Rodenbusch can respond, "That was Alice Cooper." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Oakwood has few problems with celebrities, despite reputed problems elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a misnomer to say they create problems and are very eccentric and do 
weird things," she says firmly. "Aerosmith were the nicest people in the entire 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 "Guns N' Roses stayed here," she recalls, "and there were never any problems. 
The home-like atmosphere makes them treat it like home. Axl and Slash would sit 
in the Jacuzzi and just chat with their neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 But "a few funny things" have happened when housing heavy-metalers, Rodenbusch 
says. A member of another band -- she won't say who -- left his pet alligator 
to lounge in the bathtub, terrifying a housekeeper. Still yet another band 
member's pet snake decided to take a trip from its second-story bathroom home, 
through the toilet, only to end up coming out of the first-floor tenant's 
toilet. Needless to say, those residents now look before they sit. 
</P>
<P>
 While A-list stars may stay in pricier quarters when working on projects, much 
of the cast and crew end up in one of the complex's 1,151 apartments. While at 
work on Janet Jackson's most recent album, her associates took up 63 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of Oakwood's clients, however, are child actors who flock to Los 
Angeles during pilot season, from January through April. "We have about 300 
kids and their families during that time," Rodenbusch says. Rodenbusch can 
provide "a lot of information on the industry. I can get them agents' names, 
acting schools, dance schools, beeper companies, cellular phones, car rentals, 
tell them how to get child work permits and tutors. 
</P>
<P>
 "With child actors, there can be animosity between families," she says, 
pointing out a time when two families taunted each other so fervently during a 
performance a fight had to be stopped. "Child actors have to change from being 
kids to small working adults," she says with a sigh. "That animosity and 
competitiveness is only among the parents, not the kids."

CHRIS FOSTER: PLEASE DIAL 1-800 O.C. ALL-SPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hi, and welcome back to All Orange County Prep Sports Radio. That's all 
sports, all preps, all Orange County, all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's go back to the phones. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is Tustin's basketball team so much better this season?  
</P>
<P>
 Well, basically, the Tillers have learned how to catch Doug Gottlieb's crisp 
passes. Not only has it provided more victories, but it has also cut down on 
team dental bills and kept Coach Andy Ground from looking into Rogaine with 
minoxidil. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the success of the World Cup help high school soccer?  
</P>
<P>
 Nope, sorry. Too many American sports fans still can't think with, or on, 
their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did Brea Olinda change its name from Brea-Olinda?  
</P>
<P>
 It was former Ladycat basketball Coach Mark Trakh's last wish before he died 
of obscurity at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Mater Dei's second-place finish at the Reebok Holiday Prep Classic mean 
the Monarchs are the second best high school team in the nation?  
</P>
<P>
 Don't know. The next poll won't be out until after the Nike shareholder 
meeting in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Which was the most serious injury suffered on the Santa Ana Valley boys' 
basketball team?  
</P>
<P>
 Easy, that bruised ego. The Falcons cleared out space in the trophy case, then 
the season actually began. But don't worry, that room will be put to good use. 
I hear the school's soccer team is pretty good. 
</P>
<P>
 Hi, I have a question about high school golf.  
</P>
<P>
 Sorry kid, this is a sports show. Next. 
</P>
<P>
 You know Melody Peterson and the rest of the Mater Dei girls' basketball team 
are doing pretty good. So how come we don't hear more about them on your show?  
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei has a girls' basketball team? Wow. 
</P>
<P>
 Who is the best basketball player in Orange County?  
</P>
<P>
 Gottlieb. 
</P>
<P>
 How about when the Clippers play at The Pond of Anaheim?  
</P>
<P>
 Oh, that's different. It's still Gottlieb, but it's a lot more crowded toward 
the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 Who's the most self-sacrificing figure on the Orange County sports scene?  
</P>
<P>
 Why that would be referee Al Hackney, who went all the way to Las Vegas just 
to work in the Holiday Prep Classic. Apparently there must have been some 
shortage of refs in the greater Las Vegas area. He worked six games, all 
involving Mater Dei. He canceled his plans to return early so he could work the 
title game. The man's a giver. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams stay in Anaheim, will there still be a rain clause for high school 
games?  
</P>
<P>
 Yes. If it rains on the weekend of the Mater Dei-Los Alamitos playoff game, 
then the Rams have to move their game to Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brea Olinda girls' basketball team has had three coaches in three seasons 
and continues to win. Do the Ladycats actually need a coach?  
</P>
<P>
 No, but they could use a hyphen. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Katella boys' basketball Coach Tom Danley has another decent team, 
will he give up his quest for an Orange County Section?  
</P>
<P>
 No. But considering the county's financial problems, Tom may have to reduce 
his goal. How about an Anaheim Section? 
</P>
<P>
 What game at The Pond will be the most exciting this season?  
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei-Crenshaw Round III. That is, of course, provided the Clippers don't 
move any playoff games there. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you really dislike Mater Dei?  
</P>
<P>
 No, no, no. That would be silly. You can't harbor ill feelings toward a 
collection of buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, that's all the time we have today. See ya next year.

 Allen Krist 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita, Junior 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball/Center 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, his first on the varsity, Krist started an occasional game for 
the Eagles. This year, after hitting the weight room hard in the off-season, 
Krist is helping lead the team.Last week, he averaged 16.7 points and 10 
rebounds as Santa Margarita won the Encinitas San Dieguito tournament for the 
second consecutive season. Krist, the tournament's most valuable player, had 15 
points and 14 rebounds in a 43-35 victory over Torrey Pines in the title game. 
In a 62-56 victory over San Diego St. Augustine in a semifinal, Krist, 6 feet 
8, had 14 points and 10 rebounds and played tough defense on Jelani McCoy, a 
6-10 center who has signed with UCLA. McCoy scored 23 points but had only six 
rebounds. "(Krist) has really improved offensively and defensively," Santa 
Margarita Coach Jerry DeBusk said. "He now has the physicalness it takes to get 
it done." Basketball

TURN, TURN, TURN; ALONG WITH THE NEW YEAR COME THE CUSTOMARY RESOLUTIONS FOR 
CHANGE, AND THOSE CAN EXTEND TO HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS AS WELL. WHAT NEW SPORTS YOU 
WOULD LIKE TO SEE PLAYED, WHAT NEW RULES MIGHT BE IMPLEMENTED, WHAT NEW LEAGUES 
SHOULD BE FORMED...IN OTHER WORDS, WHAT CHANGES WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IN PREP 
SPORTS IN 1995?

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If only the world could be perfect, which is to say, if only I could make the 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
 You want to know what I would do? Fewer cliches. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the sportswriter's nightmare. I'm not allowed to write them and athletes 
(and theircoaches, especially) shouldn't be allowed to say to say them. 
</P>
<P>
 Show me a kid who says, "I swear on a reporter's grave," and I'll show you an 
immediate friend of the family. 
</P>
<P>
 Show me a coach who says, "We take each game like we eat our food -- one bite 
at a time," and I'll show you somebody whom I'll always respect. 
</P>
<P>
 No more "one game at a time" quotes. Puhleeeze!  
</P>
<P>
 I know you can't play two games at a time!  
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and those Trabuco Hills football uniforms? Trash them. I can't tell what 
the numbers are while I'm trying to keep my precious statistics. Did 36 carry 
the ball, or was it 38, 88, 86, 96 or 98?  
</P>
<P>
 If I could change anything -- or everything -- about high school sports in 
1995, the wonders I could work. 
</P>
<P>
 I would change the acoustics inside the Century gymnasium so I could hear 
myself think, and install air conditioning in the Orange gym so the guy next to 
me wouldn't stink. 
</P>
<P>
 I would have all the parochial and private schools in the same league so the 
public schools wouldn't whine anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 I would have a giant monitor in every gym and show replays of fans' behavior, 
so they could see just how childish they sometimes act. And I would make every 
one of them officiate at least one game. And then I would make them write about 
it. And then I would make them pick the all-county team. And then I would make 
them field the phone calls from other angry parents upset over who made the 
all-county team. 
</P>
<P>
 I would demand that every child attend the school closest to his place of 
residence because I get tired of those Week 9 recruiting violation allegations 
against A.) Los Alamitos football, B.) Mater Dei boys' basketball, C.) 
Woodbridge girls' basketball. . . . and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 I would get the point across to football players that they're not any more 
special than any other athlete on campus, and I would get the point across to 
baseball players that there's enough arrogance at the professional level 
without you starting in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 I would outlaw hip-hop before, during and after basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
 I would make everyone who sings the national anthem sing it straight to avoid 
those embarrassing moments when I feel sorry for them. 
</P>
<P>
 I would change the Southern Section baseball championship to a best-of-three 
format so one player or umpire can't decide a champion. 
</P>
<P>
 I would make swimmers wear numbers on their caps so anyone can keep track of 
who's who. 
</P>
<P>
 I would lower the price of admission -- it is, after all, just high school. 
And I would get the point across to some coaches that it is, after all, just 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
 I would make sure there was plenty of money to go around -- to education and 
programs, not players. 
</P>
<P>
 I would make baseball coaches wear regular street clothes because A.) it might 
be funny and I live for my own amusement; B.) there are no such things as 
player-coaches in high school; C.) what's next, John Barnes in shoulder pads or 
Gary McKnight in a tank top? 
</P>
<P>
 I would eliminate six-team leagues in favor of eight-team leagues because 
eight-team leagues have more credibility, especially in football. 
</P>
<P>
 I would get in the face of basketball referees and tell them not to assume 
every time a girl blocks the ball that it's a foul, that too many defensive 
players get whistled for blocking when they have clearly planted both feet, and 
that tall people shouldn't be whistled for a foul when other players invade 
their vertical space. 
</P>
<P>
 I would give seeded teams the option of hosting a first-round playoff game 
because that's usually the one game in which they don't need the home-field 
advantage -- or I would give them the outright home-field advantage throughout 
the playoffs. If you win, you should be rewarded. 
</P>
<P>
 I would eliminate the northern-most 100 miles of the Southern Section -- San 
Luis Obispo isn't south of anything except an eventual bottle of wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, somebody else might have some other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 In this installment of Prep Voices, The Times Orange County asks: 
</P>
<P>
 "What changes would you like to see in high school sports in 1995?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I would have a zero-tolerance rule on trash talking in basketball. If people 
have respect for their sport, then they should have respect for their 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 I would also eliminate all all-county, all-league teams and most valuable 
player-type awards -- all individual awards and statistics -- because sports is 
a team game, and if you're worried about your statistics, you can't be focused 
on what you need to do in other areas to accomplish the task. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennie Gadd 
</P>
<P>
 Troy senior 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Roller hockey is pretty popular right now. There are a lot of kids involved, 
and that's a sport that needs to be looked at pretty closely if we are to add 
new sports. But with all the Orange County fiscal problems, it's going to be 
pretty tough to get money out of anyone for something new. 
</P>
<P>
 John Barnes, 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos athletic director 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I think high school boys' basketball may be the only level that does not have 
some kind of shot clock. It should, maybe 35 seconds like the colleges do. If 
you ask me why, I can't give you a specific reason other than it's odd the 
girls have it, college has it, the international game has it. . . . It wouldn't 
change the game that much; the talent is more evenly spread out now. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich Prospero 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley basketball coach 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I'd like to see them get the Catholic schools in their own league. I watched 
that Los Alamitos-Mater Dei game and it just didn't seem fair. Los Al had all 
kids from their own neighborhood and Mater Dei had maybe three that lived in 
their area. Most states have a public school champion and a parochial school 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm happy for Mater Dei. I think it's great for California that they're doing 
so well. I just think that everybody would like to have that same opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitch Olson 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy football coach 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to see high school walk-on coaches (mostly lower level) aware of 
the high school rules. A lot of these coaches come from college and only know 
the college or professional rules. The head coaches and athletic directors need 
to make sure that all coaches are aware of all the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Brisacher 
</P>
<P>
 Football and track official 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to see high school volleyball players be able to continue to play 
beach volleyball during the high school season. Right now, practice starts in 
late August and there are still beach tournaments going on, but we can't play 
in them because of the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Misty May 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor senior 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to see CIF take a look at revising divisions. The way it's set up 
now definitely needs to be looked at and maybe switched to an enrollment basis. 
Also, the way free-lance schools get into the playoffs and what division they 
are placed in needs to be revised.  
</P>
<P>
 I would also like to see more women in the teaching and coaching roles. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Paul 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Lutheran girls' 
</P>
<P>
 athletic director 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to see them (sports) all continued and not cut due to the current 
budget problems. I feel that high school athletics help teen-agers feel better 
about themselves. They, along with other extracurricular activities, help keep 
kids out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Derek Haas 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I would increase the amount of funds given to sports other than football. It's 
important because the more different sports a school has -- such as surfing, 
roller hockey, badminton -- the kids have more chances to broaden their 
horizons. A lot of girls' programs get overlooked, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Yool Kim 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa High, Class of '93 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I would let the Southern Section enforce its rules -- every time the section 
wants to enforce something, someone wants to enforce legal action against them. 
</P>
<P>
 There are coaches out there blatantly doing things wrong, and they're looking 
at other coaches saying, 'Look at me and what I'm getting away with,' and it's 
a slap in the face of the coaches who run clean programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The CIF has rules that protect athletes from burnout and from being with their 
club coaches incessantly, and they're great rules, but the CIF's overlooking 
them because someone always wants to take them to court. The Southern Section 
has its hands tied trying to enforce its rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The other thing I would do is change the fly-by-night coach who comes in, 
breaks the rules in a hurry and leaves and doesn't suffer any of the 
repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Cary Crouch 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills softball coach 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to see a stadium built somewhere on a neutral site that is run by 
the schools so when there's a big game, the schools get the money from the gate 
and the concessions. The way it is now, whenever there is a big game, the 
schools end up losing out on some money. I'd like to see a stadium built that 
holds about 25,000 people, so no one gets turned away, and see the schools get 
all the money from parking and concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Larson 
</P>
<P>
 Yorba Linda 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The one thing I'd change is having more kids participate in sports just 
because they enjoy the sport. We used to have more of that. Now, there's too 
much what's-in-it-for-me. I want to see kids playing the game because they 
enjoy being part of it.

 I'd like to see the club soccer season end at the same time the first day of 
high school soccer practice begins. As of now, club players are allowed to play 
with club teams up until the high school's first contest. The reason being is 
it puts high school coaches in a tough position whenever they need a kid for 
practice and they're off playing in a club tournament. Also, you risk losing a 
player to injury before the season even begins.

 I believe that it is unfair that private schools should compete with public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei has the No. 1 basketball team in the county, by far, but how many of 
those players live near its campus in Santa Ana? . . . Mater Dei can select its 
students and athletes from throughout Orange County, while public schools have 
set boundaries. . . . Perhaps private schools could have their own league, like 
the Angelus League, that had schools such as Mater Dei, Servite/Rosary and 
Bishop Amat. 
</P>
<P>
 Another thing that I want to comment about is the way county leagues are set 
up. The leagues should consider being more geographically oriented in order to 
be more cost efficient (transportation) and promote more rivalry and 
competition. How about a Santa Ana League, since the four Santa Ana high 
schools have never been in the same league, this would seem sensible. Phil

 If there was one thing I would like to see changed in high school athletics it 
would be better officials. The officials need to know what's going on and let 
us play a little more. They call way too many fouls and they need to be more 
educated as far as officiating -- not all of them, but some of them.

 I could probably list over a dozen things I would like to see change in high 
school sports in '95. 
</P>
<P>
 The two big ones would be private schools separated from public schools 
because they have an unfair advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 The other is that I would like to see more parent support. In the Garden Grove 
League, it's real bad. I wish for the kids' sake that parents would be able to 
support them more.

 I'd appreciate it very much if the No. 1 team in Orange County, whether it be 
Mater Dei or Los Alamitos, would play one of the top-ranked teams in the nation 
in football to decide once and for all who's No. 1. This year, Mater Dei should 
play the team from (Miami, Fla.) Southridge to decide who really is No. 1. I 
think that can be arranged by extending the season one week. That would be good 
for the fans and would bring in a lot of revenue for the parties involved.

 There are several things, starting with those things that are trickling down 
from the pros and college, and should not be part of high school. Specifically, 
trash talking and taunting. We should get back to why we have high school 
sports. It's not a training ground for college; a scholarship should be way 
down the list. The state of affairs is out of whack. 
</P>
<P>
 The transferring of kids -- open enrollment -- should be tightened. Too many 
uninformed people are making bad decisions, going by wins and losses and not 
what's good for the kids. Parents should have to pass a test to justify why 
they want the transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 And it would be good if newspapers eliminated the stats. Sometimes players, 
parents and even coaches get caught up in them too much. I'm not sure that's 
why we do it.

 College recruiting rules need to be changed. It would be a lot better if 
colleges could contact you before you contact them, and the number of visits

 My big change would be to get the money to fund athletics without booster 
support. In some areas we rely 90% on boosters, while schools pay for the 
transportation and officials. But things such as uniforms, equipment and the 
extras you need to run a top program, to ask boosters to raise $5,000-$15,000 
is not right. 
</P>
<P>
 We got a good deal at Estancia from Reebok for a discount on shoes, and that 
is realistic. I don't mind doing some advertising; ideally you want no strings 
but in this day and age anyway to get it done without the parents is better. 
</P>
<P>
 To ask parents to raise funds puts coaches in an awkward situation, and you're 
more beholden to them. But I'd feel the same way as the parents. If I give 
money, it's hard for there to be no strings. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know where the money is coming from, especially now in Orange County, 
but there needs to be some change.

 The biggest change needed is the way schools are put into CIF divisions. It 
should not be 1-A, 1-AA, etc. The way they do by pure numbers (school 
population) is wrong. That's why you see a Santiago and a Century play in the 
highest divisions -- with Mater Dei and Los Alamitos -- and it's not fair. Then 
someone like Corona del Mar with 700 students plays in the lowest. But if you 
compare the number of athletes they have to the ones at Santiago, Corona del 
Mar has more.

 The divisional playoffs got better this year, but football is one of the few 
sports that doesn't deal with enrollment. If there is some system that they can 
incorporate similar to volleyball and basketball, where a 3,000 enrollment 
school is playing a 3,000 enrollment school, that would help. Then, year in and 
year out, you play people on the same level, drawing the same type of kid you 
are.

 I would enjoy an Orange County section. It would make each game that much more 
meaningful. 
</P>
<P>
 (Also,) maybe the teams at the bottom of our league belong in an easier 
(league). That would be the equitable thing to do. There's so much disparity in 
our league now. It's top or bottom and there's no in-between. I don't see how 
we can change that, unless we break up the Garden Grove League.

 One of the items that I would like to see changed in the year to come is more 
funding for high school athletics. High school athletics desperately need more 
funding, especially on the girls' side. I also feel that the girls should be 
funded equally so they have the same number of teams in each sport.

PICKUP-STYLE GAME GIVES SAN CLEMENTE AN UPSET 
</P>

 Miracle on Avenida Pico . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A beat-up, injured, rebuilding San Clemente girls' basketball team that had 
won only half its 10 games, scored a 61-51 victory over fourth-ranked -- and 
previously unbeaten -- Marina last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked; I couldn't believe it," San Clemente Coach Mary Mulligan said 
the day after the sport's biggest upset of the season. "It was one of those 
fluke things. Everything we put up went in. Every girl on my team was 
unconscious." 
</P>
<P>
 The really strange part of San Clemente's 10-point victory is that the Tritons 
trailed, 12-0, in the first quarter against the Vikings, who possess one of the 
county's best front-court trios. 
</P>
<P>
 But get this: San Clemente led by 20 points with four minutes left, meaning it 
had outscored Marina by 32 points during about a 22-minute stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't run any offense; I told the girls at halftime, just drive it and 
kick it out, and try to get as many shots as you can," Mulligan said. "Do 
anything you can to keep moving and take the first good shot you can get. . . . 
We were playing pickup basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tritons made 15 of 20 free throws in the fourth quarter when Marina tried 
to close the gap. 
</P>
<P>
 Mulligan said this was one of the biggest victories in her nine-year coaching 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 It came after three players were injured -- including San Clemente's top post 
player, Kate Turnbull -- and another had quit to concentrate on volleyball.

 Short shots from the Santa Barbara Tournament of Champions: Brea Olinda's 
girls' basketball team scored only three second-quarter points in Saturday's 
championship loss to Woodbridge, losing a 65-game winning streak in the 
process, 51-33; during one stretch, the Ladycats went 6 minutes 53 seconds 
without a field goal. Brea also made only one field goal over the game's final 
5:48. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge Coach Eric Bangs broke a three-year drought by getting called for a 
technical foul in Wednesday's 70-41 victory over L.A. Washington Prep. Said 
Bangs: "I wish I had earned it."

 Pearson isn't the Warriors' leading scorer -- she's fourth with a nine-point

Bangs said."It doesn't matter if she's gassed or not -- we'll call her number 
in crucial situations." Pearson was called upon often last week in the Santa 
Barbara Tournament of Champions and came through well enough to be named the 
most valuable player. Pearson averaged 10 points, eight rebounds, five assists 
and three steals as the Warriors (9-0) won the tournament title. In the 51-33 
victory over Brea Olinda for the title, she had seven points, 11 rebounds and

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: VALLEY BANKS EXPECT PINCH FROM LIMIT ON SBA LOANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Small Business Administration's announcement last week that it will impose 
a $500,000 ceiling on loans offered through its popular loan guarantee program 
was seen as a serious setback by some San Fernando Valley banks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to lose an awful lot of business," said Frank Ures, chief 
executive at American Pacific State Bank in Sherman Oaks, one of the largest 
SBA lenders in Southern California. Ures said about 75% of American Pacific's 
SBA loans are over $500,000 and that the ceilings could hurt the bank's profits 
by as much as 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 Through its loan guarantee program, the SBA helps provide low-interest 
financing to small-business owners. Generally, commercial banks like American 
Pacific make the loans, but the SBA insures up to 90% of the money disbursed. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, there was no ceiling on loan size, though the guaranteed portion 
of each loan could not exceed $750,000. But starting Jan. 1, no loan over 
$500,000 will be considered, and the maximum guaranteed portion will be about 
$450,000. The SBA said it needed to impose a ceiling because it would otherwise 
run through its $7.8-billion federal allocation for the 1995 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Local banking executives said the SBA's decision came as a surprise and a 
disappointment. TransWorld Bank in Sherman Oaks recently joined the SBA's 
Certified Lenders Program, which allows it to process SBA loan applications up 
to two weeks more quickly than non-certified lenders. The bank said it was 
hoping to double the size of its SBA loan portfolio this year to $10 million, 
but now expects to fall $1 million short of that goal. 
</P>
<P>
 American Pacific State Bank has loaned more than $25 million through the SBA 
program this year, Ures said. He added that the new SBA ceiling could be 
particularly damaging to Southern California lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The region's struggling economy has made small businesses reluctant to take 
out capital improvement loans, which tend to be relatively small, Ures said. As 
a result, most of American Pacific's loans have gone to businesses buying 
commercial real estate, and those loans tend to be larger, especially because 
real estate prices are higher in Southern California than in most areas of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to stay in the SBA program," Ures said. "But right now we're 
going to have to do some creative planning to try to make up the difference."

FIRM MAKES IMPRESSION IN RAPID PROTOTYPING; VALENCIA: 3D SYSTEMS LEADS THE 
INDUSTRY THAT PROVIDES MACHINES FOR MAKING PLASTIC MODELS FROM COMPUTER DESIGNS 
IN HOURS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER PENDLETON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1992, Logitech Inc., a computer peripherals maker, had a chance to win a 
big contract from IBM. The computer giant needed to produce a two-button 
computer mouse in a hurry. IBM gave Logitech a two-week deadline to come up 
with a working model and a price to mass produce the part. 
</P>
<P>
 So Logitech turned to an unusual model-making machine it had purchased from 3D 
Systems Corp. in Valencia. The 3D technology can convert a computer design into 
a real plastic model in hours instead of the weeks associated with traditional 
modeling materials, such as wood, clay and metal. 
</P>
<P>
 When Logitech executives met with IBM a week later, they were able to show IBM 
a working model, and Logitech won the business on the spot. "It blew our 
competition out of the water," said Rick Lutzinger, Logitech's director of 
mechanical engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of quick turnaround is why 3D Systems has sold more than 450 of 
these machines, known in the trade as rapid prototyping systems, to some of the 
country's largest companies, including GM, Chrysler and Ford, in addition to 
aerospace companies, toy makers and producers of consumer goods, such as 
Tupperware. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the estimated 891 rapid prototyping systems at work in manufacturing 
facilities worldwide, 3D is the industry leader, according to Wohlers 
Associates of Ft. Collins, Colo., an industry research company. 
</P>
<P>
 3D also does in-house design work for customers, besides selling the modeling 
machines. And 3D's broadening reputation has finally meant profitable times for 
the 8-year-old company. The company posted a $2.1-million profit for the nine 
months ended Sept. 30, compared to a $920,469 loss a year earlier. Meanwhile 
its sales jumped 38% to $31.1 million in the latest nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a sharp turnaround for 3D, which despite its interesting technology, 
for a long time had difficulty building a profitable business. The company lost 
nearly $10 million in 1991. Management changes followed, including the hiring 
three years ago of chief executive Arthur B. Sims, a high technology industry 
veteran, who led the company through layoffs and installed marketing changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sims set out to broaden the company's revenues by relying not just on selling 
the pricey modeling machines, which can cost from $100,000 to $500,000. Now 3D 
sells service contracts to maintain the machines for buyers, and it also has a 
staff in-house that is hired to build models for customers that don't want to 
buy 3D's sophisticated machines, but still want to use the technology. Today 
only half of the company's revenues are dependent on the sales of new machines. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has reported five consecutive quarterly profits, and Sims hopes 3D 
Systems is at the start of a new period of prosperity, while finding new 
applications for its technology. Next year it's also entering a new, and 
potentially large, market with the introduction of a lower-priced, desktop 
modeling machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts like the changes at 3D. "The new management has done a good job at 
leading the company into controlled, consistent growth," said Antoine Tristani, 
technology analyst with Southcoast Capital in Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 "The challenge we face is much the same kind of challenge the early computer 
companies faced," said 3D's Sims. "We've got to figure out where our greatest 
potential lies." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, 3D, which once had the rapid prototyping field to itself, will soon 
contend with 20 rivals. "All the companies that have jumped in want a piece of 
3D's pie," said Rolf Hubert, vice president of marketing at Sanders Prototype 
Inc. of Wilton, N.H., a new 3D rival. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 3D also faces the task of convincing conservative manufacturers -- as distinct 
from its first wave of customers -- that its high-priced technology is worth 
the investment. So far, 3D has sold the bulk of its high-end machines to an 
elite tier of companies that pride themselves on being at the technological 
forefront. 
</P>
<P>
 3D's machines work like this: An engineer using computer-aided-design software 
designs, say, a car part. That design is then fed into a 3D machine, which 
contains a laser above a vat of liquid plastic. A computer guides the laser to 
draw a line on the surface of the resins to create a cross-section of the part. 
That first section immediately becomes solid. 
</P>
<P>
 The machine then drops a fraction of an inch and creates another cross-section 
in the liquid above it. This process is repeated until, a few hours later, a 
three-dimensional model is completed (hence, the company's name). 3D's founder 
Charles Hull, who remains company president, developed this modeling method in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers use these prototypes to see how a product will look, and to test 
and spot flaws before committing huge sums to tool up manufacturing plants to 
build the actual parts. Another key appeal is to shorten the time it takes to 
get new products to market. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1988, Ciba-Geigy Ltd., the giant Swiss chemical conglomerate, has owned 
36% of 3D's stock. Ciba develops materials for 3D's technology under an 
agreement that expires in July. The companies are discussing the terms of an 
extension of that agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 If analysts are correct, rapid prototyping is also a business that will grow 
rapidly. Wohlers Associates estimated sales of rapid prototyping equipment and 
supplies at $100 million worldwide in 1993, and expects that by 2006, the 
industry will hit $1.2 billion in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to grow, however, 3D must find new markets. Since 1993, 3D has been 
offering a new application for its machines that can create models for metal 
parts. 3D's vice president of strategy and market development, Richard 
Fedchenko, believes "QuickCast," as this new system is called, will eventually 
be larger than 3D's traditional plastic parts business. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also hopes to sell its products to the medical industry. Several 
research hospitals and medical companies are now using 3D's technology to make 
models for prosthetics, and prototypes of human bones and organs that can help 
surgeons plan operations. Doctors within hours can examine an exact model of a 
specific patient's fractured body part before starting an operation. That 
dramatically shortens the operation, and will probably help the patient recover 
more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Medicine is a real wild card," said Sims. "I would be really surprised if it 
doesn't grow even faster than the manufacturing applications." 
</P>
<P>
 3D executives are also preparing for the 1995 introduction of a smaller 
prototyping machine suitable for engineering use on desktops. The price will be 
around $50,000. So far, 3D hasn't revealed the details of this desktop model, 
prompting much industry speculation. Some question whether the liquid resins 
and industrial chemicals that 3D uses in its top end models, which shouldn't be 
touched directly, will work in an office setting. 
</P>
<P>
 But many in the business see the marketing promise of a lower-priced modeling 
machine. "All of us recognize the desktop market has a lot of potential," said 
Jennifer Maher, marketing manager with Helisys of Torrance, a 3D competitor. 
"But in order to be successful, you've got to get high volume." 
</P>
<P>
 Industry watchers say 3D's image suffered in its early years because company 
officials often oversold the technology's benefits. Manufacturers were 
initially dazzled, but became disillusioned when many couldn't figure out how 
to make the modeling machines improve the manufacturing process, said Geoffrey 
Smith-Moritz, editor of the Rapid Prototyping Report, an industry newsletter in 
San Diego. "Companies that bought them ended up making paperweights," he 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, 3D's executives say they must be careful not to over-promote the 
technology, especially with new customers. "In the end it comes back to 
performance, not the promises you make," said Fedchenko.

VALLEY'S CHARITY GIFTS DIP IN 1994; DONATIONS: THE QUAKE AND A POOR ECONOMY CUT 
INTO CONTRIBUTIONS TO KEY WELFARE AGENCIES, HITTING THE SALVATION ARMY AND 
OTHERS ESPECIALLY HARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERROL A. COCKFIELD JR., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake was almost a year ago, and the recession is fading 
away. But as San Fernando Valley charities began tallying their figures for 
1994, they found more Scrooges than generous donors. 
</P>
<P>
 With Los Angeles County still rebounding from recent economic troubles, 
private donations to local charities have dwindled by as much as 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 So like any business going through hard times, charities had to adjust in 
1994. Some cut staff or moved to cheaper locations, some ended programs for the 
needy, and, in some cases, they joined forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Valley charities had to streamline their operations and find other 
sources of funding if they were to survive in this sluggish era of giving. 
</P>
<P>
 Fund raising "is well under what it was last year," said Troy Trimmer, 
director of the Van Nuys office of the Salvation Army, but "we've done a better 
job of keeping our costs under control." His unit raised $70,000 in 1994, a 36% 
drop from the $110,000 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Christmas season, the Van Nuys office usually hires 40 temporary 
workers, most of them homeless, to collect Salvation Army donations. But this 
year, Trimmer said they were able to hire only 20. The charity also eliminated 
its twice-weekly breakfast program for the needy because of a lack of funds, 
Trimmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Way, which helps fund about 300 charities in Los Angeles County, 
including 63 in the Valley, cut back its giving dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 There are still lingering effects of the earthquake, said Barbara Bickel, a 
senior communications specialist for the United Way. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going out and trying to find alternative sources of funding," said 
Margaret Pontius of Guadalupe, an arm of the Catholic Charities, which provides 
food assistance to needy families in Canoga Park. Guadalupe has seen its United 
Way funding diminish as well, said Pontius. 
</P>
<P>
 But what has been a more crushing blow is a decrease in funds raised by 
direct-mail appeals to individuals in the local community. 
</P>
<P>
 Pontius said not many have responded, although the number of needy families 
turning to Guadalupe has almost tripled in the last year.  
</P>
<P>
 To offset costs, Guadalupe has sought other kinds of funding and has bombarded 
private foundations, the city and the federal government with requests. 
</P>
<P>
 The results enabled the charity to hold its annual Christmas party for 600 
children of impoverished families last week. 
</P>
<P>
 But some organizations have taken even more drastic measures to survive. 
Glendale Family Services Assn. and Verdugo Mental Health Center merged this 
month to consolidate costs and expand their fund-raising efforts. Verdugo 
Mental Health Center is now the parent organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at it from more of a business perspective. . . . We needed to 
do something that would allow us some permanency," said Jim Balla, director of 
operations for the Glendale Family Services Assn., which had a $900,000 annual 
operating budget before the merger. 
</P>
<P>
 Both organizations understood that many family-service charitable 
organizations with budgets under $1 million were going out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 The Verdugo-Glendale operation now has a combined budget of $3.3 million. The 
merger will place the organization in a stronger position to get government 
grants, Balla said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The move was necessary because fund raising decreased 50% for both 
organizations in 1994, said Lyn Brandstater, Verdugo Mental Health Center's 
executive director. That drop forced the organization to set up an office 
solely for fund-raising development, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandstater attributed the lack of donations to "a still downsized economy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Western Los Angeles Boy Scouts of America, in Van Nuys, has also been 
trying to improve its finances. 
</P>
<P>
 The group ended up 1992 $1.8 million in the red, and "so we've been digging 
out," said Del Hanks of the organization, which has cut its debt to $1.4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Things are looking up. The Scouts group thinks it will raise $1.9 million this 
year, which will provide it a $300,000 surplus, after expenses, or three times 
what was netted last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "When this economy got tight, we cut staff, got out of our office and went to 
a more economical place," Hanks said. "We ended up meeting our expenses this 
year," It moved from a costly location on Ventura Boulevard to Sherman Way and 
cut its staff in half. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Salvation Army office in Van Nuys last week, 600 needy families were 
given toys, some donated by individuals and others purchased with funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers scurried through a courtyard to the front of the building as they 
filled bags with toys. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the courtyard was one tiny room filled with what little food the 
organization was able to collect this year for its emergency food assistance 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, the courtyard is normally filled with non-perishable goods 
collected at food drives throughout the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The families would traditionally collect a bag of food along with a bag of 
toys. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, however, the courtyard was empty and the families left only with 
toys.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: HOUSE OF FABRICS LOSES $73.2 MILLION IN QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 House of Fabrics Inc., which is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, 
reported a $73.2-million loss for its fiscal third quarter that ended Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss came on a 36% plunge in sales for the quarter, to $90.6 million.A 
year before, the Sherman Oaks fabric retailer lost $25 million on $141.8 
million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The company blamed the sales decline mostly on store closings. Included in the 
loss for the recent quarter was a one-time pretax restructuring charge of $49.6 
million for the store closures, and a $19-million provision for marking down 
certain products that no longer fit the company's new merchandising program 
emphasizing crafts and home decorating. 
</P>
<P>
 During the quarter, House of Fabrics said, its same-store sales declined 19% 
because its financial problems led to a lack of some inventory, and it 
continued to face sharp price competition in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Oct. 31, the company had closed 62 mall stores, and 10 of its "super 
stores" were also closed in the third quarter. Another 38 mall stores and 170 
super stores are scheduled to close by April 30. 
</P>
<P>
 In the nine months that ended Oct. 31, House of Fabrics lost $86.3 million, 
compared to a year-earlier loss of $29.8 million. Its sales fell 21%, to $315.4 
million from $399 million.

THIS CREW HOPES TO BUILD SUPERHIGHWAY FOR TV COMMERCIALS; TECHNOLOGY: TINY 
SHERMAN OAKS FIRM AND ITS PARTNERS ENVISION ZAPPING ADS TO CABLE VIA COMPUTER. 
BUT INFRASTRUCTURE AND FINANCING ARE STILL IN EARLY STAGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 You've heard of the information superhighway. What about the television 
superhighway? 
</P>
<P>
 Independent TeleMedia Group, a tiny company in Sherman Oaks, has tentatively 
signed on to the dream of a Colorado man named Rich Schmelzer, who hopes to 
launch the nation's first coast-to-coast network for sending commercials via 
computers to air on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, most commercials you see on cable TV get there through the most 
low-tech means imaginable: Advertisers duplicate scores of videotapes and 
deliver them through couriers to cable offices scattered over the country. 
Operators then pop them into a VCR at the appointed time. But this is 
time-consuming and labor-intensive, and the VCRs often break down. 
</P>
<P>
 The new system aims to use an electronic storage and delivery program called 
video file servers. These are computer systems capable of downloading video 
spots from a computer network linked by phone lines and satellites. 
</P>
<P>
 The video file servers would deliver high-quality pictures to cable operators 
with speed and convenience unknown today. In theory, the proposed network would 
allow advertisers to zap commercials to cable television operators and 
broadcasters instantly, so that, say, when the Raiders win a football game, 
spots featuring their players would run immediately on the blast of the final 
whistle. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, Independent TeleMedia announced it would acquire both SkyConnect 
Inc., of Boulder, Colo., the company Schmelzer founded; and Mediatech Inc. of 
Chicago, the nation's largest distributor of commercials and video programming. 
</P>
<P>
 By merging three companies, the group hopes to combine all the elements of a 
new delivery system for commercials. "Now we can do in minutes what before took 
days," said Schmelzer, who is SkyConnect's executive vice president. "It's like 
a giant e-mail network" for video, said the 29-year-old Schmelzer, a former 
video distributor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a quantum leap," said Lew Eisaguirre, chief financial officer of 
Independent TeleMedia. "The cable industry has been waiting for this." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, though, this dream of creating a video superhighway is just that. Only 
three companies have bought the necessary hardware and software to receive 
digital commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many experts expect that eventually the television industry will 
evolve toward this kind of distribution system for commercials, how that 
evolution will be brought about is far from clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would it be good overall for everyone to have digital insertion (equipment)? 
Yes. The problem is who do you get to do what, first?" said Paul Woidke, vice 
president of operations for Adlink, a Los Angeles-based partnership of cable 
operators that is a potential customer of Independent TeleMedia's. 
</P>
<P>
 And the three would-be partner companies still have to close their deal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Independent TeleMedia, a former telecommunications and billing company that 
sold off all assets last year, is now a public shell company with $5 million to 
invest. SkyConnect has the technology. It's developed hardware and software 
that squishes video programs into digital form and spews them out on the 
receiving end to be put on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Mediatech is a 20-year-old advertising distributor with $20 million in annual 
revenues that sends out commercials and TV programs for 3,000 clients via 
videotape deliveries and satellite signals. That's important, because it 
provides an ongoing source of revenue while the computer network comes on line. 
</P>
<P>
 The final piece in this puzzle comes from Denver-based IntelCom Group, a 
telephone company with 1993 revenues of $30 million. IntelCom is majority-owned 
by the Becker Group of Denver, which is also majority shareholder in 
SkyConnect. For several years, IntelCom has been laying fiber-optic cables and 
building satellite uplinks for its system of private-access phone lines. 
Eventually, SkyConnect could use those same lines to transmit video programs 
over its network, said Becker Group spokesman Phil Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisitions are to take place through a stock-swap arrangement, but 
shareholder approval is still pending. The deal was described by Eisaguirre 
earlier this month as still tentative. If it goes through, Independent 
TeleMedia will close up shop in Sherman Oaks, move the company headquarters to 
Boulder and take the name of SkyConnect. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is much interest in digital commercial delivery systems due to 
technological advancements that speed up the process, many companies may offer 
alternatives to SkyConnect's systems. 
</P>
<P>
 And other competitors, including computer companies, may eventually step up to 
rent space on existing phone lines and deliver video programming themselves. 
"Digital is new, and I can't say whose technology has the leg up and who 
doesn't," said Peggy Conger, editor of Cable Avails magazine in Denver.

COVER STORY; THE YEAR IN REVIEW: FOR VALLEY BUSINESS, THERE WAS MORE THAN JUST 
THE EARTHQUAKE; '94 SHOOK BUSINESS TO THE CORE; NORTHRIDGE QUAKE JOLTED THE SAN 
FERNANDO VALLEY ECONOMY WITH PROFOUND, LONG-LASTING EFFECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Northridge temblor that hammered the region in January is still shaking 
the business community as the year draws to a close. Retailers, contractors, 
insurers and a host of large and small businesses whose livelihood depends on a 
local customer base have all been coping with its aftereffects. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the earthquake wasn't the only big business story in the San 
Fernando Valley this year. Aerospace and defense industry downsizing continued 
to plague the region. The beleaguered real estate market showed signs of 
recovery -- albeit a weak one. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were some success stories, including a few booming health-care 
concerns. Saban Entertainment, the Burbank firm behind the hit "Power Rangers" 
children's TV show, and growing pool supplies retailer Leslie's Poolmart in 
Chatsworth both enjoyed a good year. 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen Inc. in Thousand Oaks also remained a standout. The world's largest 
biotechnology concern, still riding high on sales of two blockbuster drugs, is 
expected to post a record profit of $430 million in 1994. In November, Amgen 
said it would buy Synergen Inc., a struggling Boulder, Colo., biotech company, 
for $240 million. Analysts said the deal will broaden Amgen's research in 
developing drug No. 3 in hopes of fueling its future growth. 
</P>
<P>
 And there were failures -- including the liquidation of DAK Industries, the 
once-popular Canoga Park electronics catalogue firm, and the Chapter 11 
bankruptcy filings of apparel maker Cherokee Inc. and fabric retailer House of 
Fabrics Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's the earthquake that reigned as the No. 1 story this year. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the companies hardest hit by the quake was 20th Century Industries. For 
years, the Woodland Hills insurer was profitable due to its low-cost auto 
insurance business. But its smaller homeowners' business nearly sank the 
company in 1994 as it suffered a staggering $900-million estimated loss from 
earthquake damage claims. 
</P>
<P>
 On the brink of insolvency, 20th Century closed a deal this month with 
American International Group Inc., the big New York insurer, under which AIG 
could eventually invest more than $400 million in 20th Century and own more 
than 40% of its stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake also threw the local retailing industry into a tailspin. In the 
first weeks after the temblor, stores and shopping malls struggled to get back 
in operation. Home repair meccas such as Home Depot were crowded with weary 
shoppers, and big-selling items included flashlights, batteries and bottled 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 As the months went on, many retailers who reopened quickly benefited from the 
absence of badly damaged rivals. Undamaged or lightly hit malls in Woodland 
Hills, Glendale and Thousand Oaks saw sales rise from 10% to 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 Others weren't so lucky. Parts of the Sherman Oaks Fashion Center were out of 
commission for several months. Laurel Plaza in North Hollywood has been closed 
permanently. And the Northridge Fashion Center, once one of the region's most 
successful malls, was the most heavily damaged in the quake and remains dark as 
repairs continue. Only the Broadway and Sears department stores there managed 
to reopen in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Small merchants in hard-hit areas continued to suffer, including those along 
one devastated block of Reseda Boulevard in Northridge, near the crumpled 
Northridge Meadows Apartments, where 16 people died in the quake. The shop 
owners there have seen the neighborhood turn into a ghost town as residents 
fled condemned apartment buildings and as many homeowners moved out during 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of those shopkeepers, Laura D'Angelo, worked tirelessly to keep her Kids 
at Heart gift shop afloat. Half the units in the strip mall where her store is 
situated remained empty after the quake. The mall owner gave up and deeded the 
property to the lender. Sales at remaining shops fell from 10% to 80%. Yet 
throughout the year, D'Angelo persisted, posting signs, offering discounts and 
hosting parking lot promotions in an effort to keep her small business going. 
</P>
<P>
 For local building contractors, the anticipated rush in earthquake repair jobs 
didn't materialize right away. In the initial months after the quake, most were 
busy making estimates, but the wait for federal assistance and insurance money 
meant delays in rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until at least six months after the quake that carpenters, plumbers, 
masons, electricians and construction companies began seeing the hoped-for boom 
in earthquake repair jobs. The new business provided a boost for an industry 
weakened by years of hard times caused by the slowdown in new home 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the earthquake, the local aerospace industry continued to shrink in 
1994. A survey conducted in mid-year found that the eight major aerospace and 
defense concerns in the San Fernando and Antelope valleys and Ventura County 
had reduced their payrolls by a collective 15,000 jobs so far this decade, or 
an average of 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 The downsizing hasn't ended. Just this month, up to 220 Teledyne Inc. workers 
in Northridge and Newbury Park received termination notices as the company 
prepared to complete the pending sale of its electronic systems division to 
Litton Industries Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, Hughes Aircraft Co. moved about 1,000 workers from its West Hills 
missile systems facility to Tucson and closed the local complex, part of an 
ongoing consolidation of its manufacturing operations. Last week, Mayor Richard 
Riordan announced the sale of half the Hughes property to Coast Federal Bank in 
an unusual transaction that was brokered by a nonprofit corporation created by 
Riordan to assist local business. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed Corp. has agreed to merge with Martin Marietta, creating the world's 
largest defense concern, with $23 billion in annual sales. As a result, 
Lockheed will soon leave its Calabasas headquarters, where about 250 
white-collar workers are employed, and move to Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 One bright spot in the local economy this year was the resurging auto sales 
market. Car dealers in the area reported sales increases after stagnant or 
declining business since the start of the decade. At Galpin Ford in North 
Hills, for instance, one of the nation's two largest Ford dealers, sales 
through the end of November were running 38% ahead of a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Local banks and savings and loans, although still hampered by a weak economy 
and the earthquake, also began to see a modest recovery late in the year as 
they continued to pare away at poor loans. Glendale Federal Bank, which was on 
the verge of being seized by federal regulators a year ago, by the third 
quarter of 1994 had posted a $9.4-million profit. Giant Great Western Financial 
Corp. in Chatsworth, Oxnard-based Ventura County National Bancorp and 
TransWorld Bancorp in Sherman Oaks all turned profitable again in the September 
quarter after year-before losses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The battered San Fernando Valley housing market also showed signs of a modest 
recovery in 1994, with sales of existing houses growing throughout the year. 
But the increased sales came while prices continued to fall. By November, the 
average resale price of a house in the Valley slid to $220,500, down 8% from a 
year earlier. Helping drive down housing prices were record numbers of 
foreclosures throughout the Valley, in part because of the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 It was another good year for three Woodland Hills health maintenance 
organizations, or HMOs, which have seen their enrollments surge in recent 
years. Health Net, CareAmerica and CaliforniaCare, the HMO arm of Blue Cross -- 
which cut costs by negotiating discounts with doctors and hospitals -- swelled 
in size as more employers signed up in hopes of stemming their soaring medical 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 But squeezed by meager reimbursements from Medicare and severe pressures from 
HMOs, some local hospitals are fighting to survive. A survey of 29 acute-care 
hospitals in the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys this year 
found that more than half were unprofitable and that their hospital bed 
occupancy averaged just 40%. Despite efforts to cut costs, many predict 
widespread hospital closures in the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Some local companies jumped into the information superhighway race during the 
year. GTE of California in Thousand Oaks detailed plans to build a high-tech 
video network in Ventura County and three other markets. Pacific Bell targeted 
the Valley as one of the staging grounds for its $16-billion statewide plan to 
bring consumers interactive video and data services. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was a disappointing year for Iwerks Entertainment Inc. in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, the supplier of special-format movie theaters was riding high 
because of its new virtual-reality attractions, and its 1993 stock offering was 
among the year's hottest. But this year, reality of another kind set in, and 
disappointing sales led to an $8-million loss in Iwerks' fiscal year that ended 
June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in 1994, the airline wars took center stage at Burbank Airport, where 
market-dominating Southwest Airlines was challenged by a new low-cost service 
offered by United Airlines. The Shuttle by United began flying from Burbank and 
other Southland airports in October, competing against Southwest's low-fare 
flights to the Bay Area and its other short hauls. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest recently warned that its fourth-quarter earnings would be down 
sharply, due in part to the competition from United. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the exodus of businesses from the region continued. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest companies to announce such plans was Packard Bell 
Electronics, the personal computer maker, which is moving from Westlake Village 
to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 And 1994 ended on a bad note for once-renowned Sherman Oaks businessman 
Quentin Thomas (Q.T.) Wiles. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, Wiles was found guilty in federal court in Denver on three felony 
counts of fraud and insider stock trading from his management of now-defunct 
MiniScribe Corp., a computer disk drive maker. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiles, 75, was known as Dr. Fix-It for his rescues of troubled high-tech 
firms, but after he left his post as MiniScribe chairman in 1989, new 
management uncovered what it called a "massive fraud" at the company to boost 
profits and inventory numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Wiles was sentenced to three years in prison.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW / JACK SEARLES: VENTURA COUNTY HOME SALES STRONG IN 
NOVEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 To the surprise of analysts, home sales in Ventura County were strong in 
November despite rising mortgage rates. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 841 new and resale houses and condominiums were sold in the county 
last month.That's nearly 4% more than the 810 sold in October and almost 7% 
above the 788 escrows that closed in November, 1993, according to Dataquick 
Information Systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices rebounded somewhat but remained below the year-ago level. The county's 
overall median sale price in November of this year was $189,000 -- up almost 2% 
from the previous month but 4% below November, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market's strength wasn't expected, really," Dataquick analyst John 
Karevoll said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People seem to be deciding to make purchases before interest rates go even 
higher. Also, there seems to be a feeling that prices aren't going to go any 
lower." 
</P>
<P>
 As for next year, Karevoll expects home sales in the county to continue 
relatively strong. Prices should stabilize as foreclosures level off, he 
believes. Along with the recession, a flood of lender-owned properties was 
blamed for soft housing prices in recent years.

ITT TO SELL ITS COMMERCIAL FINANCE UNIT; TRANSACTION: $4-BILLION DEAL IS PART 
OF FIRM'S EFFORTS TO DIVEST ITSELF OF ENTITIES NOT RELATED TO LODGING AND 
ENTERTAINMENT.

 ITT Corp. will sell a big piece of its far-flung empire to the U.S. arm of a 
large German bank for about $4 billion, the companies said Monday in one of the 
biggest takeover deals announced this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale of ITT's commercial finance unit comes a week after the hotel 
conglomerate arranged to buy Los Angeles-based Caesars World Inc. for $1.7 
billion in a major bid to boost its presence in the gambling and entertainment 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 ITT is selling ITT Commercial Finance to Deutsche Bank North America, the 
American subsidiary of one of Germany's largest banks. ITT Commercial Finance 
lends money to distributors of products ranging from personal computers to 
motorcycles, a business known as asset-based lending. 
</P>
<P>
 For Deutsche Bank, the acquisition will quadruple its presence in asset-based 
loans to about $5.1 billion, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This acquisition will accelerate DBNA's strategy to become a leader in the 
rapidly growing business of asset-based lending," John Rolls, DBNA president 
and CEO, said in a statement. "ITT Commercial Finance has established a strong 
industry presence reflecting its record of product innovation, systems 
development and strong financial performance." 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase will cost about $4 billion, said Christian Allaire, a spokeswoman 
for DBNA, a unit of Germany's Deutsche Bank AG. No other financial terms were 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 ITT, parent of the Sheraton hotel chain, has been trying to bolster its 
entertainment and lodging division, which lags behind its two more established 
core businesses -- insurance and manufacturing. As part of that effort, ITT had 
said it would seek bids for its consumer and commercial finance business. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, ITT and the cable company Cablevision Systems Inc. agreed 
to pay the entertainment conglomerate Viacom Inc. $1.08 billion for Madison 
Square Garden, which owns the New York arena of the same name, pro basketball's 
Knicks, pro hockey's Rangers, and MSG, a sports cable network. 
</P>
<P>
 It also bought 70.2% of the CIGA Hotel Corp., which has 31 luxury hotels in 
Europe, for about $550 million, and paid another $260 million for the 
Phoenician resort in Scottsdale, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 New York-based ITT has also been shedding businesses deemed nonessential. 
Earlier this year the company spun off its ITT regional cable network.

PESO LOSES MORE VALUE AGAINST DOLLAR IN MEXICO; CURRENCY: EXCHANGE RATES 
FLUCTUATE WILDLY AT BORDER EXCHANGE HOUSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Mexican peso lost more value against the U.S. dollar on Mexico's currency 
markets Monday as jittery investors anticipated declining interest in Mexican 
securities and continuing political unrest in Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 The peso slipped more than 30% against the dollar last week after the Mexican 
government decided to let its value float freely against the dollar. An 
extended period of volatility could be in store as investors wait to see how 
strongly the Mexican government acts to control inflation and whether foreign 
investors regain confidence or flee the country, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the peso slipped in two-day futures contracts, closing at 5.1 pesos 
to the dollar, compared with 4.95 on Friday, a 3% loss, said Carlos Escalante, 
an analyst at Vector-Mex brokerage in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 Because U.S. markets and Wall Street investment houses were closed Monday for 
the Christmas holiday, trading was light, sporadic and volatile. An analyst at 
Baring Securities in Mexico City said trading today will more accurately 
reflect the peso's worth. 
</P>
<P>
 The peso's value declined amid wildly fluctuating quotes Monday at several 
currency exchange houses at the U.S.-Mexico border in San Ysidro, ranging from 
4.69 new pesos to nearly 5 to the dollar Monday afternoon. The rate "is 
changing every five minutes," said an employee at Trolley Stop Money Exchange 
in San Ysidro. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market is extremely volatile, and my guess is that it will be this way 
for a couple of months" said Enrique Kennedy, manager of Bancamex, owner of 
several exchange houses in San Ysidro. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican stock market index, meanwhile, closed up 0.94 points, or 0.4%, to 
close at 2,342.79 on Monday. Mexican stocks have risen in past days as the weak 
peso has pushed share prices higher. This is in part because investors figure 
that many Mexican companies will benefit from the devaluation as Mexican 
exports get cheaper and imports get more expensive, making Mexican goods more 
competitive at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Further fallout from the devaluation is expected this week as traders and 
government officials return from the Christmas holidays. An estimated $800 
million of tesobonos, which are fixed-income securities denominated in dollars, 
will mature this week. Traders fear owners of the bonds won't roll over their 
holdings and will seek instead to obtain dollars for the maturing securities, 
driving down the peso.

HOSPITALS, EXERCISERS PROFIT BY FITNESS; HEALTH: IN PROGRAMS FOR THE GENERAL 
PUBLIC, MEDICAL CENTERS HAVE FOUND A STRONG SOURCE OF REVENUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY DELGADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After suffering more than 20 years from arthritis in both her knees, Irene 
White became convinced that an exercise program would relieve her pain. But the 
93-year-old couldn't see herself joining the high energy, spandex-clad, 
buns-of-steel set found at many commercial gyms. 
</P>
<P>
 White found both the services she needed and a more comfortable, low-key 
atmosphere at Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital's fitness center. For a mere 
$165 a year, she enjoys personalized attention from Daniel Freeman's physical 
therapists and exercise counselors three times a week. And after several months 
of aquatic aerobics, White says her pain has been reduced significantly. "All I 
can say is that it's better late than never." 
</P>
<P>
 White, although older than the Inglewood center's typical client, is one of a 
growing number of people turning to fitness centers affiliated with hospitals. 
Some need specialized exercise programs, but many others are joining for 
routine physical fitness. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of hospital-affiliated fitness centers blossomed in the 1980s as 
many hospitals looked for extra sources of revenue. They were considered a bold 
move for the conservative hospital industry, but most of the fitness centers 
have proved profitable, and in many cases they have helped compensate for 
losses in other hospital operations, according to John Greene, executive 
director of the Assn. of Hospital Health and Fitness Centers, based in 
Evanston, Ill. Currently, there are about 1,000 such gyms around the nation. 
But the growth has slowed in the 1990s because the threat of health care reform 
and major changes in the industry have pushed hospitals back into a 
conservative mode -- especially in California, said David Langness, a spokesman 
for the Hospital Council of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 But Langness said he believes the tide is turning again in favor of a growth 
in hospital fitness centers. "Companies used to shop for price, not benefits, 
and any frills were cut out to save costs," he said. "We're seeing a major 
shift now in terms of an emphasis on wellness rather than sickness," he said, 
explaining that more companies are now willing to subsidize employee fitness 
programs. In fact, Daniel Freeman receives some support from some corporations 
that subsidize employees who use the facility for routine exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The hospital industry has not been very aggressive on the prevention aspect 
of health care," said Greene, but it does have competitive advantages in 
marketing its programs. "When you join a hospital health care center, you get a 
better level of personal attention and guidance from properly trained 
professionals," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial fitness centers and gyms, naturally, are not eager to see any more 
hospital affiliated fitness centers. Many commercial club owners say hospitals 
are unfair competition because they benefit directly or indirectly from 
taxpayer support. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our private members should not have to compete with subsidized entities," 
said Irma Campbell-Cook, executive director of the Portland, Ore.-based 
Northwest Athletic Club Assn., which represents 90 clubs in the West. "We want 
a level playing field." 
</P>
<P>
 Although hospitals claim that their facilities attract people who would not 
ordinarily patronize a gym, Campbell-Cook said they are indeed competing for 
many of the same customers and offer some of the same services. Many of the 
gyms in her group have older clients and have had to offer specialized programs 
to remain competitive with hospital facilities, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital fitness centers "see us as sweatshops for a small portion of the 
population, but if they visited one of our clubs, they would see that that's 
not the case," Campbell-Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospitals and the commercial industry are not always in competition. South Bay 
Hospital in Redondo Beach helps recruit clients for private clubs. South Bay, 
funded partly by Los Angeles County taxpayers through the Beach Cities Health 
District, offers residents or employees of Manhattan Beach, Redondo Beach and 
Hermosa Beach the opportunity to enroll in short-term health awareness programs 
at its fitness center. After a program lasting no longer than four weeks, South 
Bay clients are encouraged to enroll in a health club program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We introduce people to a gym who would normally not go and then send them to 
the private gyms," said program director Paula Neubert. Because of the 
hospital's funding, Neubert said, "legally, we cannot get into competition with 
private health clubs in the area." 
</P>
<P>
 According to AHHFC, hospital fitness centers are typically smaller than 
private clubs and only 20% of their members previously worked out at commercial 
clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Daniel Freeman fitness center was originally built in 1982 for Freeman 
doctors, but it gradually was opened to patients who needed physical therapy 
and to members of the public.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, the fitness center offers its 800 clients facilities for swimming, 
weight lifting, aerobics, basketball and racquetball in addition to the special 
programs for people in need of rehabilitation services. 
</P>
<P>
 The fitness center operates as a regular department of the hospital, and 
whatever profits it makes, though limited, go back to the hospital, according 
to supervisor Susan Stohrer. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Volland, 70, is a two-time graduate of the fitness center's cardiac 
rehabilitation program. He joined the center in 1984 for a short period after 
suffering a heart attack and rejoined in 1990 after a second heart attack, 
which he attributed to having canceled his first membership. 
</P>
<P>
 "My doctor recommended it, and I'm sure it has helped me quite a bit," Volland 
said. The fitness center staff "gets on you if you miss a few days, and I need 
that kind of prodding," he said.

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: RETIREES FACE NEW RULE ON INCOME; 1993 LAW 
CHANGES THE WAY SOCIAL SECURITY IS TAXED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF

<TEXT>
<P>
 Norbert E. Talbert is steaming mad. He is a man of modest means, but he's 
being taxed like a millionaire. And he doesn't like it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been double-crossed on Social Security. We have been double-crossed 
on municipal bond interest. And we have been doubled-crossed on the idea that 
we should live modestly and save so that we can take care of ourselves in our 
old age," the 71-year-old retiree fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 What set Talbert off is a 1993 tax law that will kick roughly 5.5 million 
middle-income Social Security recipients into the nation's loftiest federal tax 
bracket for the first time this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in 1994, single Social Security recipients who earn more than $34,000 
and married couples with more than $44,000 in income get taxed at roughly a 42% 
marginal rate, says Ken Andersen, tax partner at the national accounting firm 
of Arthur Andersen & Co. The top marginal rate for millionaires is 39.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 The new tax rules dramatically boost the marginal tax rate -- the rate you pay 
on every additional dollar over a threshold amount -- because every dollar 
earned over the threshold pushes more Social Security income into the taxable 
column. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual amount of tax is tough to calculate, however, mainly because there 
are now three levels of taxation for Social Security income. And there are 
three different ways to calculate your liability. 
</P>
<P>
 You choose the calculation that comes up with the lowest tax obligation. 
Congress did that to reduce the hit on people who were just slightly over the 
new Social Security tax thresholds. In any case, the result is that you have to 
fill out an 18-line work sheet to determine your actual liability. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a handful of strategies retirees can use to reduce the hit, but they 
are aggressive, often onerous and largely irreversible. And, to complicate 
matters, some Republican members of Congress want to return to previous ways of 
deciding how much Social Security is subject to income, which puts these 
retirees in a sort of Catch-22. 
</P>
<P>
 Tax-saving strategies that may seem logical this year could look crazy in 1995 
if the tax is indeed eliminated. Some retirees say they have little choice but 
to pay the tax -- and live more simply as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "What this means to me is I am not going to be able to do something," says 
Joseph Koukol, a Los Angeles area retiree. The new Social Security tax will 
cost Koukol roughly $2,000, he says. "I won't starve, but it probably means I 
won't be able to take a vacation." 
</P>
<P>
 What exactly is this tax that's causing retirees such consternation? It is a 
levy specifically on Social Security income. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, Social Security income was 50% taxable if you had significant 
amounts of other income. 
</P>
<P>
 The 50% figure had been justified for many years because, at least in theory, 
retirees were simply paying tax on the 50% of the contributions that had never 
been subject to tax before. Workers pay income tax on earnings that go into the 
Social Security system, but companies -- which provide half of each worker's 
Social Security contributions -- do not. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, if you don't make too much money, you're not taxed. The 
government leaves benefits untouched for singles earning less than $25,000 and 
couples earning less than $32,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in a revenue-raising move last year, Congress decided to make Social 
Security benefits 85%-taxable for certain "high-income" retirees. Congress 
defined "high-income" as above $150,000 for non-retired married couples but at 
$44,000 for retirees. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Social Security recipients maintain that disparity is hardly fair. 
Although a retired person without a pension would have to have more than half a 
million dollars stashed away to produce that kind of investment income, a good 
pension could easily throw an otherwise modestly retired worker into that 
range. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They also argue that subjecting more than 50% of the benefit to taxation 
affects the half of Social Security that has been taxed before. Federal income 
taxes are based on your gross earnings, before Social Security taxes are taken 
out. That means you pay state and federal income taxes on the amount withheld 
and sent into the Social Security system. If you also pay tax on that money 
when you start receiving the benefits, the same dollars are getting taxed 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
 What's worse is there are few ways to plan around the Social Security tax. But 
millionaires -- and virtually all individuals other than retirees -- have lots 
of tax shelters at their disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, most taxpayers can enjoy tax-free earnings if they invest in 
municipal bonds. Not so for middle-income retirees. So-called "tax-exempt" 
income must be added into the calculation when determining how much of a 
retiree's Social Security income is taxable. It may be coming through the back 
door, but that effectively makes municipal bond interest taxable for anyone who 
earns more than the threshold amounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Another way to avoid taxes is to contribute to retirement plans. But few 
retirees have much earned income, so they can't. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich Americans can get breaks by investing in tax shelters and growth stocks 
that don't pay regular income. But most retirees are living on their investment 
income. These investments simply force them to make due with less -- a highly 
unattractive tax strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How can a retiree battle the Social Security tax? There's really only one 
strategy that can substantially reduce the hit. It only works for married 
couples and it may violate personal and religious ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can get divorced and live in sin," says Nancy Anderson, manger of 
special tax projects at H&R Block in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider what happens to a retired couple who earn $60,000 between them, 
including $12,000 in Social Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the new law, $10,200 of their Social Security income is taxable 
versus $6,000 in the previous law. Assuming they pay an effective rate of 28% 
on that income, the tax on their Social Security earnings amounts to $2,856. 
(Under previous law, the tax bite on their Social Security income would amount 
to $1,680 -- $1,176 less.) 
</P>
<P>
 Now consider what happens if this couple decides to legally divorce and divide 
their income exactly in two. For example's sake, we'll also assume they both 
receive the same Social Security benefits -- $6,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax on their Social Security income dives to $280 per person, or $560 
combined. That's a whopping $2,296 savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, homeowners age 55 and over get an additional tax break that's 
multiplied by two for those who divorce but continue to reside in the same home 
and claim it as their primary residence. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, if this couple sold their home when they were married, they 
would be able to exclude $125,000 in gains from tax. If they sold their home 
when they were legally divorced, they'd be able to exclude $250,000 from tax -- 
$125,000 each, says Philip J. Holthouse, partner at Holthouse Carlin & Van 
Trigt in Los Angeles. With the capital gains tax at 28%, together that saves 
them $70,000 in federal taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The one problem with divorcing for tax purposes is it's fairly irreversible. 
Although your marital status at the end of the year is what matters for the tax 
man, if you divorce in December and remarry in January, the IRS will deem the 
divorce a sham and slap you with taxes and penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, it forces couples to take a hard look at their estate plans. 
While divorce can aid some estate planning techniques, those who want to leave 
their assets to a former spouse need to say so in a will or a living trust. 
Otherwise, your estate is divvied up according to state intestacy laws when you 
die, which don't grant ex-wives and ex-husbands much clout.

 How do you determine how much of your Social Security earnings are taxable? 
It's not easy. It ranges from nothing to 85%. To figure it to the penny, you 
must fill out an 18-line work sheet -- as well as a 1040 or 1040A tax form. The 
key factors are marital status and income. This chart can help you make a 
simple guess. Amount of a $10,000 annual Social Security benefit subject to

NEW PUSH FOR INFO SUPERHIGHWAY; TELECOM: THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION IS 
REDOUBLING ITS EFFORTS TO PROMOTE THE TECHNOLOGY, BUT IT FACES SEVERAL 
OBSTACLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stung by the defeat of its telecommunications agenda in Congress this fall and 
facing industry criticism that it isn't doing enough to promote the technology, 
the Clinton Administration is intensifying its efforts to put the information 
superhighway back on the political map. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore has recently been courting Republican congressional 
leaders in hopes of working with them on telecommunications reform legislation 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown has invited the vice president, 
Justice Department antitrust chief Anne Bingaman and Federal Communications 
Commission Chairman Reed Hundt to a telecommunications summit next month. The 
group will plot strategy for a landmark international conference set for 
February in Brussels, where government officials and industry leaders aim to 
set an ambitious global telecommunications agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has not been any change in emphasis, but there may be a change in the 
way we express our message," said Greg Simon, the vice president's chief 
domestic policy adviser. In working to bring the world into the Information 
Age, Simon added, "people shouldn't just focus on legislation. This is not just 
about (passing) a bill in Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 The flurry of activity comes in the wake of the Republican takeover of 
Congress and a recent admonition by an administration advisory panel that the 
White House "must place a much higher priority on finding ways to communicate 
effectively the benefits of the (information highway) to the average American." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since taking office two years ago, Gore and President Clinton have campaigned 
intensely for government and industry to build an information superhighway that 
would provide ordinary citizens with electronic access to data held by 
government, industry and schools. Gore has given dozens of speeches throughout 
the United States and abroad explaining the benefits of such links, and Clinton 
last summer persuaded world leaders to hold the first-ever global 
telecommunications policy meeting, in February. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent months, issues such as health care, taxes and crime have 
eclipsed the information highway as political priorities. And in the wake of 
several failed industry mega-mergers, companies have been hesitant about 
committing billions of dollars to rewire the nation without a clearer 
indication that consumers want fancy Information Age services. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Information Infrastructure Advisory Council, in its Dec. 6 letter 
to Brown, credited the administration with "noteworthy progress" in making 
telecommunications modernization a national goal. But the panel of educators 
and technology executives, including MCI Chairman Bert C. Roberts and Silicon 
Graphic Chairman Ed McCracken, said the administration could do more. 
</P>
<P>
 It urged the White House to "work closely with Congress to achieve the 
objectives of increased competition, diversity of ownership, the establishment 
of regulatory parity, open access and continued deployment of an advanced 
infrastructure." 
</P>
<P>
 But that could now prove even more difficult than it was earlier this year, 
when Capitol Hill lawmakers produced telecommunications bills that sailed 
through the House and a key Senate subcommittee, only to run aground when Sen. 
Fritz Hollings (D-S.C.) tabled the Senate measure amid bickering between 
long-distance carriers and the regional Bell phone companies. The two factions 
remain at odds over the ground rules for the Baby Bells' entry into the 
lucrative long-distance phone business. 
</P>
<P>
 And other obstacles also loom on Capitol Hill, where some Republican lawmakers 
were reportedly irked that they were not informed early on about Brown's Jan. 9 
telecommunications summit. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore's adviser Simon said that "all of the people who are (committee) chairs 
and ranking leaders were invited to" the summit, and added that "we have not 
heard any partisan reaction to this meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Republicans are clearly pressing to gain greater influence over 
telecommunications policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The powerful and outspoken House Speaker-to-be Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who 
calls himself "an information futurist," has his own strong ideas about 
information technology. His party's "Contract With America," for example, 
advocates greater public access to Congress by making pending legislation 
electronically available through computer on-line services. Gingrich has 
indicated that he wants to harness computer on-line services into a sort of 
electronic town hall. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Republicans are not of one mind on telecommunications issues, which 
have traditionally revolved around conflicting industry interests rather than 
partisan issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Some key Senate leaders, such as incoming Senate Commerce Committee Chairman 
Larry Pressler (R-S.D.), have indicated that they support less stringent 
regulation of the Baby Bells' entry into long-distance phone service. That 
could put him at odds with incoming House Commerce Committee Chairman Rep. 
Thomas J. Bliley Jr. (R-Va.), whose Richmond-area congressional district is 
home to a major AT&T plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very much a divided place," said one Congressional aide.

 Japan May File Charges in Bid-Rigging Cases: Japan's anti-monopoly watchdog is 
poised to file rare criminal charges against nine electronics firms and their 
executives, alleging bid-rigging going back as far as January, Japanese media 
said.The Fair Trade Commission has been investigating suspicions that the 
firms, which include industry leaders, repeatedly rigged bids and arranged in 
advance the winners of contracts for water supply and sewage systems for 
regional governments. A commission spokesman declined to comment on the 
reports. The five largest firms allegedly involved are Toshiba, Hitachi, 
Mitsubishi Electric, Fuji Electric and Meidensha.

 Los Angeles Led Nation in Trade, Report Says: Los Angeles had the highest 
volume of international trade of any U.S. city during the first three quarters 
of 1994, surpassing New York. The international trade volume through the U.S. 
Customs Service's Los Angeles district from January through September was 
valued at $106.2 billion, up 21% from the same period last year, said a study 
by Claremont McKenna College's CMC-Tradeweek Quarterly.

SHOPPERS, DRAWN BY WHAT'S IN STORE FOR THEM, PACK MALLS; SALES: FROM COSTA MESA 
TO BREA, THOUSANDS HEAD OUT EARLY TO SCRAMBLE FOR POST-CHRISTMAS BARGAINS.

 Visions of women's dresses at half-cost, men's shoes down 33% and Christmas 
decorations at a fraction of their original price danced in the heads of 
thousands of Orange County shoppers who roused themselves from 
post-turkey-dinner stupors early Monday to snatch up bargains. 
</P>
<P>
 Store managers around Orange County happily reported armies of shopping troops 
descending on their shelves for the traditional day-after-Christmas sales. And, 
shoppers reported that at times they really did feel as though they were 
engaged in battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know women could be so vicious in a men's department," said Gary 
Wolfe of Irvine who, along with his wife, Laura, had just spent two hours in 
Nordstrom's men's shoes department at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "They swing those bags and start grabbing things," he said. "You almost have 
to bring shoulder pads." 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Wolfe said one overly aggressive customer competing for a spot at the 
shoe racks ran smack into her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She almost knocked me down. She didn't even look," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But other shoppers said the Wolfes might have made a tactical error by waiting 
past 8 a.m. to get to the stores. The smartest shoppers beat the biggest crowds 
by lining up as early as 6:30 a.m., said valet parking manager Chris Sengdara. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were the early bird people, you know, the people who really wanted to 
get the good stuff," Sengdara said. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside Nordstrom, which had both its after-Christmas and biannual menswear 
sale, an estimated 1,500 people were queued up by the time the doors opened. 
</P>
<P>
 By 10, both the lots and the stores were jammed and the shopping frenzy was in 
full swing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Store managers said that sales seemed to be matching economists' predictions 
of a 5% or 6% increase in Christmas buying this year over last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The overall holiday season has met our expectations so far," said Nordstrom 
public relations director Linda Luna-Franks. "Lots of people get gift 
certificates or money for Christmas and are eager to spend. They're looking for 
values." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Brea Mall, display director Nancy Chadwick packed up garlands and other 
decorations that had adorned Santa's Victorian Village, where hundreds of 
children came to have their pictures taken this season until 6 p.m. Sunday 
night. Between bouts of shopping, several parents with children came by Monday 
asking if Santa was still at the village, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them Santa had already gone to make his rounds and then home to the 
North Pole," Chadwick said. "The little kids were sad, but no one cried, thank 
goodness. I couldn't have taken that. I think their mothers had prepared them." 
</P>
<P>
 But while Santa rested, thousands of shoppers at Brea Mall took up his cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Joannie and Randy Caffin of Anaheim, loaded down with five bags of Christmas 
decorations and clothing, said several more bags were already stashed in their 
car. They had spent at least $350 in six shops, and were not yet ready to drop, 
Joannie Caffin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The night is young, and we have our tennis shoes on," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brea police said they had braced for big crowds at the Brea Mall by assigning 
four extra officers to try to ease traffic problems. Huge lines of cars 
traversed the shopping center all day with the first shoppers arriving at 7 
a.m., police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic was especially heavy eastbound on Birch Street, which borders the mall 
to the north. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a zoo," Brea Police Lt. Doug Dickerson said. "It's extremely busy. 
Parking's a mess."  
</P>
<P>
 On the way to the parking lot and home, the Wolfes said they finally gave up 
on shopping after trying unsuccessfully to buy Gary Wolfe a pair of shoes in 
Nordstrom at South Coast Plaza. The men's shoes department was so crowded that 
sales clerks handed out numbers to customers who wanted to be served. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found out we were 298th," Gary Wolfe said. "I tried to bribe a clerk to 
wait on us, but he wouldn't take it. So we gave up. I figured it would take 
half my life, that my feet would grow before I got to try anything on." 
</P>
<P>
 But die-hard shoppers like Carolyn Harvey of Laguna Hills made up for those 
who fell by the wayside. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedged in between tables brimming with boxes of holiday cards in Bullock's at 
South Coast Plaza, and her own arms full of cards, Harvey said this was the 
first time she had ventured into the after-Christmas free-for-all and she 
planned to make a tradition of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've found several boxes of cards I like, a Santa figurine, some Christmas 
table linens, two bags of potpourri, and I may get to the decorations," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still more shoppers hunting for discounted decorations flooded Judy Gratz's 
small shop, the Country Collection at Brea Mall. Gratz said she decided to 
limit the number of shoppers she allowed in her shop at one time to 70 this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year we had 150 people in here and no one could walk," she said. "But 
the business is good. It's tiring, but we need them." 
</P>
<P>

SIGHT-SEAING; WHALE-WATCHING SEASON OPENS WITH ATTRACTIONS -- AND REACTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS KERBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 Two kinds of people go whale watching: those who get seasick and those who do 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both groups were well-represented among the 66 customers who motored out of 
Newport Harbor early Monday as whale-watching season got off to its traditional 
start on the day after Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen minutes later, in towering seas that deckhand Chris Aschoff dismissed 
as "medium," many passengers were leaning over the rail -- the victims, 
chin-first; the immune, to point video cameras at a herd of dolphins racing 
alongside. 
</P>
<P>
 With powerful, quick strokes of their tail fins, the gray-brown creatures 
surfed the wake of the bow to keep ahead of the boat, moving about 10 m.p.h., 
then diving away, their backs fading into the green water. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I'm used to it already," said Cody Kirkhart, 14, a self-described 
landlubber from Redding, watching from the starboard side. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirkhart's last time on open water was a fishing trip several years ago, he 
said, but the motion didn't bother him or his brother Brett, 17, as they took 
in the dolphins leaping along the surface of the water in pairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Staring at the shore helps," the younger Kirkhart offered, his voice eerily 
calm against the breeze and the chop. 
</P>
<P>
 The less hearty passengers remained seated amidships, eyes rolling and jaws 
tight, within a few steps of the stern as the 77-foot vessel plunged, rolled 
and yawed through a four-foot swell off Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last boat ride I was on was in Florida, and I was pretty much out of it 
the whole trip," said a palish Sandra Pond, of Wichita, Kan., visiting 
relatives in Westminster for the holidays. "I don't know that this is much 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 The Western Pride is one of several vessels operated by Davey's Locker in 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Davey's Locker isn't able to make exact viewing appointments with the 
California gray whales, whose wintertime migration to warmer waters off Baja 
California takes them along the California coastline and the western sides of 
Santa Catalina and San Clemente islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Captain Jeff Patrick wandered a northbound course along the coast, 
trading sighting gossip and rumor with fishing boats by radio and looking for 
the telltale splashes of the dolphins against the waves. 
</P>
<P>
 The random approach often pays off. Aschoff, 25, recalled seeing a pack of 
killer whales attacking a minke whale several years ago, close to shore, as the 
most thrilling sight he's seen in eight years of crewing. 
</P>
<P>
 But other outings, like Monday's, are reminders that nature discourages the 
routine. Aside from the dolphin herd there were no cetaceans to be seen, so 
Patrick finished the cruise by swinging past a light buoy where a cluster of 
sea lions lolled, like so many other Southland residents recovering from a 
holiday binge, the bull hogging the sunny side. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping tabs on whales, sea lions, dolphins and other marine mammals has 
become a serious hobby for Mission Viejo lab technician David Beeninga, a 
volunteer who narrated Monday's ride from the wheelhouse and helped Patrick and 
Aschoff plot a course. 
</P>
<P>
 A member of the American Cetacean Society, Beeninga comes along on most of the 
Western Pride's weekend trips and occasionally ventures much farther out on 
trips from Santa Barbara during the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 Beeninga said he hopes this year's sightings will be as numerous as last 
season's as the gray whales move closer to the shore during their trip south 
and during their return to Alaskan waters.

3 SWIMMERS SURVIVE ROUGH SEAS; RESCUE: AN OCEAN SWIM OFF LAGUNA BEACH NEARLY 
TURNS TO TRAGEDY WHEN THREE FRIENDS ARE TOSSED ONTO THE ROCKS. TWO REQUIRE 
HOSPITAL TREATMENT.

 Three young men -- including two former swimming and water polo standouts at 
El Toro High School -- were injured during an ocean swim Monday when chilly, 
rough seas tossed them against the rocks in a Laguna Beach cove. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime best friends Eric Sedwick and Andrew McIntyre, both 21, were taken to 
South Coast Medical Center after a daring helicopter rescue and treated for 
severe cuts and bruises, Orange County Fire Department officials said. 
McIntyre's younger brother Kevin was also bruised and slashed but did not need 
to be hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 The young men managed to crawl out of the water after four- to six-foot waves 
pummeled them against the coastal rocks. A nearby fisherman who saw them dialed 
911 about 2:15 p.m., officials said. An emergency helicopter took Sedwick and 
Andrew McIntyre to safety, and Kevin McIntyre was able to hike out of the 
remote area with the help of firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 The three were home in Laguna Hills visiting their parents from college, 
Sedwick's parents said in an interview at the hospital's intensive care unit. 
Sedwick is a political science student at UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew and Kevin McIntyre were home on vacation from the U.S. Military Academy 
at West Point, N.Y. Kevin McIntyre was a South Coast League honorable mention 
all-star pick in water polo at El Toro High School in the 1993-94 school year, 
and Andrew McIntyre received an all-county scholarship in 1991 as both an 
outstanding swimmer and student at El Toro High. 
</P>
<P>
 The McIntyre brothers and Sedwick, a serious volleyball player at Laguna Hills 
High School, had decided to swim from the northwest tip of Three Arch Bay to a 
beach near the southeast point of the bay Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 But somewhere along the way they decided to return to shore because "they 
realized it was rougher than they thought," said Teri Sedwick, Eric's mother. 
</P>
<P>
 When they tried to swim toward the beach, the water sent them into the rocks 
instead, she said. They finally gave in and tried to go with the current, but 
were beaten against the rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 They emerged from the water, with Eric Sedwick badly bruised and suffering 
from hypothermia, said Orange County Fire Department Capt. Dan Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew McIntyre and Sedwick were too weak to climb the steep cliffs, so a 
county fire helicopter was called in, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials tried to land the helicopter at the scene, but it was too large 
for the 75-foot-wide band of sand that was shrinking with the rising tide. A 
smaller Costa Mesa police helicopter zipped into the cove and landed with one 
skid in the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "The space was just about the size of the helicopter," said K.C. Gleason, 
pilot of the Costa Mesa chopper. "Time was of the essence. The area was 
inaccessible, and we were within a few feet of the cliffside. . . . (The) tide 
was rising, and the ocean was very choppy." 
</P>
<P>
 The men were airlifted to a field next to The Links at Monarch Bay golf 
course, and met by an ambulance that took them to South Coast Medical Center in 
Laguna Beach, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teri Sedwick is thankful Eric survived, but in the hospital she slipped in one 
loving warning to her son. "As your mother, I have to say to you, 'Don't you 
ever do that again!' " she recalled telling him. Sedwick's family said he is 
scheduled to be released today.

 In case a huge parade and football game is not enough Tournament of Roses 
saturation for you, a week of Rose Bowl-related family activities will be 
offered beginning today.  
</P>
<P>
 For $1 per person per location, or $2 per person for two or more locations, 
enthusiasts can see the Rose Parade floats being decorated. They can also, for 
another $2, see the Rose Bowl stadium before the big game, decked out in the 
colors of the two Rose Bowl teams, Penn State and the University of Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack French, executive director of the Pasadena Tournament of Roses Assn., 
said organizers expect 30,000 to 50,000 people to visit one or more of the 
venues over the six-day period. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds will go to local charities, French said, adding that the recipients 
will be determined later. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided we needed another event for the people in the community who might 
not get a chance to go to the Rose Bowl," French said.  
</P>
<P>
 He said the idea to expand the activities offered during the week before the 
Rose Bowl was based on a weeklong event organized by the National Football 
League the week before the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants will be selling their wares and Pasadena restaurants will be selling 
their cuisine at a food court and souvenir boutique throughout the week. Bands 
and dancers performing in the Rose Parade will offer special performances.

SOME REFINERY FOES UPSET WITH SETTLEMENT; LAWSUIT: PLAINTIFFS CLAIMED MOBIL'S 
TORRANCE PLANT CREATED HEALTH HAZARDS. SEVERAL CALL THEIR AWARD TOO SMALL AND 
SAY TERMS OF THE PACT SHOULD NOT BE SECRET. 
</P>

<P>
 The $2,500 check arrived in the mail weeks ago, but Dolores Kyle fumes that 
she has absolutely no intention of cashing it. Not for the holidays. Not ever. 
</P>
<P>
 She has tucked the check away with other remnants of the 4 1/2-year legal 
battle that she and hundreds of her neighbors waged against the Mobil Oil Corp. 
refinery in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 That battle recently concluded quietly, not with the fanfare of a public 
trial, but with a secret agreement. The settlement check issued to Kyle was 
dated Oct. 15. Ironically, that was only four days before a fiery explosion at 
the refinery injured 28 workers, spreading fresh fear among those who live 
alongside it. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Kyle is filled with indignation -- toward Mobil, toward Torrance city 
officials and toward her own attorneys for putting the brakes on a lawsuit she 
hoped would result in a court judgment requiring Mobil to make the refinery 
safer.  
</P>
<P>
 Changes in refinery safety may be part of the settlement -- but that seems 
unlikely to ever be disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
 This, environmentalists say, is a sad consequence of settling high-profile 
policy disputes in secret: The public is deprived of what could be important 
information affecting thousands of people beyond the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporations often request such secrecy out of concern that reports of a large 
settlement could prompt other people to sue in search a similar terms, legal 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I literally blew when I got that check. They settled that lawsuit, said how 
safe it was, how they've cleaned up," sputtered Kyle, a 64-year-old Torrance 
cosmetologist and former charm school teacher. A refinery neighbor since 1956, 
she blames Mobil for her long-term breathing problems. 
</P>
<P>
 She pauses to wipe her screen door with a paper towel and then brandishes the 
paper to show the black smear. Soot from Mobil, she claims with disgust. The 
same soot blackens the fuzz on her home-grown peaches, she says. And if her 
peaches are black, what about her lungs? 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 610 refinery neighbors sued Mobil in early 1990 after a series of 
explosions and fires, claiming that the sprawling facility in north Torrance 
threatened their health and hurt their property values. They complained of 
sooty homes, nausea and respiratory problems. About 350 to 400 people remained 
in the case when it was settled. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Angelo, one of the attorneys who represented the residents, said 
all plaintiffs were notified in advance of the terms of the settlement and 
agreed to it. Kyle was the only plaintiff interviewed by The Times who said she 
did not sign the settlement. However, among other plaintiffs interviewed, 
reaction to the settlement was ambivalent. Some plaintiffs dismissed the 
payments as a pittance. Others said they accepted the money because they lost 
hope long ago of winning a legal wrestling match with an oil giant. Still 
others shrugged and said their lawyers did the best they could, and some 
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Most residents interviewed asked not to be identified by name, saying the 
settlement binds them to secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
 Although details of that settlement remain sketchy, a letter to residents from 
their attorney, obtained by The Times, indicates that Mobil agreed to pay $3 
million and that residents were expected to receive $2,500 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Mobil and for the residents refused to confirm the amount of the 
settlement or discuss its terms. Refinery officials also refused comment beyond 
confirming that "the matter has been resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a confidentiality agreement, and the clients are bound by it," said 
Angelo. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobil's lawyer, Ernest Getto, said the settlement contained "no admission of 
any kind." Getto, a specialist in chemical exposure cases whose law firm, 
Latham & Watkins, has a large environmental practice, called the residents' 
suit the largest he knows of that has been brought against the refinery. He 
said Mobil has never accepted responsibility for any health problems that 
residents might claim were caused by the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
 As for such problems as sooty homes, Getto said the Mobil refinery staff 
responds to residents' complaints and tries to determine if the refinery could 
be a factor. But in the Torrance area, pinpointing a source can be difficult, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of industry down there, and a lot of manufacturing facilities," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past five years, Getto added, Mobil has invested significantly in 
safety and environmental improvements, and the refinery has won several recent 
safety awards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a client that listens to the community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The secrecy of the settlement especially riles some residents because of 
recent news reports that Torrance city officials months ago quietly altered the 
guidelines for evaluating the refinery's use of a controversial chemical, 
hydrofluoric acid. The changes were made in connection with a separate lawsuit 
the city filed against Mobil. No public hearing was held. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's the big, hidden secret?" said one plaintiff in the suit by the 610 
residents against Mobil, referring to both his case and the city's lawsuit. 
Although he received a $2,500 payment and would not agree to be quoted by name, 
he still objects to keeping the settlement confidential. "I don't think that's 
right -- I think everyone should be entitled to know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance Councilman Dan Walker, a longtime critic of Mobil, wondered why a 
confidentiality agreement was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doesn't it seem awful funny," he said, "that when Mobil gives 350 people a 
couple of thousand dollars, they want it kept confidential -- but when they 
donate $2,000 to some charity, they get their photos all over the newspaper?"  
</P>
<P>
 Kyle is so disdainful of the agreement and secrecy pact that she says she 
refused to sign the settlement papers. "Somebody's got to speak up," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kyle lives about a mile west of the refinery with her 33-year-old son, who is 
disabled from muscular dystrophy and requires a respirator. She says she is 
reluctant to move because her home is close to her son's doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 A tiny woman with an energetic style and a quick wit, she is not one to bend 
easily. She worked hard in the 1992 Ross Perot presidential campaign. Her zeal 
for the 2nd Amendment has earned her "Citizen of the Year" plaques from the 
national Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Kyle blames Mobil's fumes for the lung problems she says began 11 years ago 
when she was rushed to the hospital, unable to breathe. She has been plagued 
with breathing ailments ever since, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She scoffs at the repeated assurances from Mobil and city officials that the 
refinery has been made safer in recent years. If it is so safe, she asks, "why 
did it blast again?"  
</P>
<P>
 The Oct. 19 explosion and fire, the most serious at Mobil in seven years, 
apparently occurred when flammable gases spewed from a pipeline that had been 
left disconnected. The accident, which remains under investigation by the state 
job safety agency Cal/OSHA, reawakened old fears among some who live near 
Mobil.  
</P>
<P>
 "Every time we have an earthquake, I don't know if it's damned Mobil blowing 
up," complained another of Kyle's co-plaintiffs. "Earthquakes, I'm not afraid 
of. Mobil, I am." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The resident, who asked not to be named, said he was gravely disappointed at 
the suit's outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't do anything," he said. "The lawyers made money, and the people are 
still at risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Another co-plaintiff said that while he believes some safety improvements have 
been added at Mobil, he worries about the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always going to be the potential for an explosion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Angelo, who represented the residents, said the settlement did not 
necessarily involve only monetary payments, but he declined to say whether it 
includes changes in how the plant is run. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit was affected by a 1993 California Supreme Court decision, Potter vs. 
Firestone, that restricted the admissibility of evidence in toxic exposure 
cases, Angelo said. "The case took a significant turn," he said, "with the 
unfortunate publication of what I consider to be an anti-consumer" ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelo said that despite the confidentiality agreement, residents can discuss 
concerns about the refinery "as long as they don't talk about the case or its 
conclusion or anything else they learned due to the case." 
</P>
<P>
 David Roe, a senior attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund, said that 
while his group will not enter confidentiality agreements as a matter of 
policy, they are not a sign of nefarious dealing. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were the lawyer for a community group and an oil company was saying, 
'Here's a lot of money and a lot of cleanup, but we won't let you tell,' it has 
obvious temptations," Roe said. "Your professional obligation might be to make 
that deal happen. . . . It might be a very positive settlement for the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gail Ruderman Feuer, senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense 
Council in Los Angeles, said she is troubled by such agreements because "the 
community and the public generally do have a right to know what's happening." 
</P>
<P>
 One safety issue looming large in Torrance is whether Mobil should continue 
using hydrofluoric acid, which some critics claim is as dangerous as the gas 
that leaked a decade ago in Bhopal, India, killing thousands. The Oct. 19 
explosion occurred 50 feet from the refinery unit that uses hydrofluoric acid. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, worries about the acid helped sparked the residents' suit and the 
lawsuit brought against Mobil by the city of Torrance. The city ended its suit 
in 1991 with a consent decree, calling for a court-appointed adviser to decide 
by the end of this year whether Mobil can continue using the acid. 
</P>
<P>
 When the city and Mobil recently renegotiated the rules for evaluating the 
acid's safety, they drew the wrath of some environmentalists, who maintained 
that the changes weakened the 1991 pact. Mobil originally was required to stop 
using the acid unless a safe form was perfected by the end of this year. The 
changes will permit continued use if studies of a newly modified acid show it 
is safer than the industry alternative, sulfuric acid. The City Council's 
approval of the change was done in secret on the grounds that state law permits 
cities to privately discuss litigation.  
</P>
<P>
 Mobil scientists say they are heartened by the discovery of an additive they 
say sharply reduces the acid's lethal, cloud-forming nature. A top refinery 
official calls test results "very, very positive." The safety adviser and city 
officials are studying those findings.  
</P>
<P>
 Dolores Kyle, for one, is not convinced. She is fed up with Mobil, with the 
city, with politicians. Her peach tree appears to be dying, and black dust 
coats her big outdoor fern. She says her plants used to be gorgeous. Now, she 
doesn't even bother planting the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "After this last blast, if I had the energy," she said, "I would have been out 
there with a megaphone."  
</P>
<P>
 Times correspondents James Benning, Mary Guthrie, Jeff Kass and Susan Woodward 
contributed to this story.

TURF WAR; HORTICULTURE ARTISTS AND 'MOW, BLOW AND GO' GARDENERS COMPETE FOR 
WORK IN WELL-TO-DO AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Harry Nakamura, a gardener for almost five decades, is old school. He works 
slowly, methodically. A spry 76, he knows how to prune trees in bonsai fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Torres is a "mow, blow and go" gardener, scurrying through yards as 
quickly as 60 minutes apiece, trimming the grass, clearing away fallen leaves 
and departing for the next house. 
</P>
<P>
 Though they have never met, Nakamura and Torres are locked in a fierce, 
symbolic battle over who will care for the bucolic gardens of Southern 
California's well-to-do homeowners. The competition is so keen that it has 
helped transform professional gardening from a horticultural art into custodial 
maintenance -- the era of McYard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, most gardeners don't garden like they used to. It's a janitor type of 
thing," said Nakamura, who works for homeowners in Brentwood and Palisades. 
"You mow the lawn and clean up." 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle to stake a claim to the choicest turf is an inevitable 
consequence of a California labor market in which the newest arrivals always 
claim the bottom-rung jobs, casting aside established immigrants. As a result, 
Latinos now dominate gardening, an occupation once the preserve of Japanese 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is the competition more ferocious than in tony neighborhoods such as 
Bel-Air or Beverly Hills, where trees are carved into huge lollipops. Most 
gardeners make close to minimum wage, but in those places the work can pay 30% 
more than for a similar home a few miles away. For gardeners scraping to 
survive, a job at an estate means pay dirt in a grim economy. It means being 
able to buy meat for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Diaz learned the stakes recently when the owner of a home where he had 
gardened for 27 years fired him, explaining: "Reggie, the guy across the street 
can do it for cheaper." 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz looked at the guy across the street, the guy with the mower. By the man's 
shabby clothing and downcast eyes, Diaz figured that he was a new arrival to 
the United States, and Diaz decided to go away quietly. These are the moments 
that eat into his business in Bel-Air, the Palisades and Beverly Hills; he 
estimates that his income, now about $24,000 a year, has dropped 30% in five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardening has always been the job of the new arrival or those denied other 
opportunities because of language ability or discrimination. When Japanese 
Americans were released from relocation camps after World War II, so many went 
into gardening that at one point 70% of Japanese American men in West Los 
Angeles were working in the trade, according to one study. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Latino immigration has drastically changed that. In Los Angeles County, about 
43,000 people, mostly men, work as gardeners or groundskeepers -- and half lack 
U.S. citizenship. According to a study of 1990 census data, 75% were born in 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gardening is an important starting job," said Deborah Cobb-Clark, a labor 
economist at Illinois State University. "It has the advantage of not involving 
a lot of contact with the public so you don't have to speak English. It doesn't 
require reading or writing, so lack of education won't matter. (Immigration 
officials) are not out there checking identification of servants, so chances of 
getting caught are relatively low." 
</P>
<P>
 With a steady flow of an estimated 125,000 illegal immigrants to California 
each year, many of whom stay in the southern part of the state, gardening 
opportunities have become scarce and the glut of cheap labor has caused 
salaries to drop. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are coming in large numbers and they are desperate for anything," said 
Michael Dear, a USC professor of geography. "Gardening is not a perfect job, 
but it's better than no job at all, and often it's better than what they left 
behind. People don't come for themselves. They come for their children." 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Munoz did. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Munoz, 54, cannot help beaming when he talks about his three children, who 
were born here and attended college here. His eldest daughter became a business 
administrator, his son a computer engineer and his youngest daughter a bank 
supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Mexico, Munoz gardens for 14 clients in Bel-Air and Beverly Hills six 
days a week, 10 hours a day, with one helper, earning about $55,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been the luckiest person, the luckiest father, the happiest husband," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he has struggled every step, since the days when he picked cotton in Texas 
and oranges and nectarines in the San Joaquin Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 A gardener for 28 years, he has honed his clientele, which once included the 
likes of Doris Day and Jack Lemmon. Today he no longer works for celebrities, 
who tended to complain about sounds from mowers in the mornings. It's easier to 
work for those who are rich without the spotlight, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He pampers his clients, walking silently, invisibly, respectfully in the yards 
of their estates. When his children were young he would never bring one along, 
even if he was certain the owner was away. He knows his clients' aesthetics and 
tries to anticipate their wishes so they need not give him directions. One 
Bel-Air resident has phoned him only three times in almost three decades, 
including once to ask him to fix a broken pipe. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, of course, some queries he cannot oblige, such as the plight of the 
woman who hates the tracks that a mower leaves on freshly cut grass. 
</P>
<P>
 "She likes to see only a green carpet," sighed Munoz. "I have to convince her 
it is impossible, not even if you used a helicopter. Nothing doesn't leave a 
mark." 
</P>
<P>
 So he takes great pains to mow in precise, straight lines with perpendicular 
swathes chiseled into the grass at exact 45-degree angles. And he makes sure 
that her 30-foot-tall ficus hedges are the pride of Bel-Air. It takes him 12 
hours with his pruning shears to complete the hedges, a job that includes 
shaping coves for the Greek statues. It is so intricate a task that when Munoz 
cannot get to it, his client pays a trimming company that requires about 32 
man-hours for the same work, using hand clippers to snip each sprig. 
</P>
<P>
 When Munoz finishes, the lady of the house teases him about his 
meticulousness, claiming in jest that the gardener is irked if the birds land 
on the bushes for fear that they will mar the razor-straight lines etched in 
the shrubbery.  
</P>
<P>
 Munoz understands the historical forces that led him and his compatriots to 
replace Japanese Americans as gardeners. "We chased them out," he said. And he 
appreciates the fact that today, others want to take gardening away from him. 
</P>
<P>
 From dawn to dusk, he sees scores of threadbare Latino gardeners sweep through 
Bel-Air, roaming house to house, armed with business cards and weed whackers, 
desperate to stake their claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Some slip their phone numbers in the mailbox, hoping that a rich stranger will 
deign to call them back. The more brazen knock at doors, offering in heavily 
accented English to do the same work for less money than the current gardener. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes Munoz walks to the mailboxes after they have left and pockets their 
cards. He tries to be philosophical. "Everybody has the right to do what they 
can to survive," he said. He does not take it personally. The competition is 
merely the unfolding of the American Dream: People arrive, struggle for a 
toehold, work their way up and out of a profession. 
</P>
<P>
 In that parade, Harry Nakamura is a rarity, one of the few Japanese Americans 
who remain.  
</P>
<P>
 Nakamura remembers when every house had a gardener of Japanese descent, when 
most trees were trimmed in bonsai fashion. In recent years, Nakamura learned 
Spanish so he could communicate with helpers and the other maintenance people 
he meets. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can count the Japanese gardeners on your hand now," Nakamura said. "I 
didn't get to go to college. You go to college, you are not going to do this 
kind of work. College graduates want to push the pencil and make money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was born at the wrong time. Anybody born 20 years after I was, they had a 
better chance." 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California and across the nation, a division of labor has emerged. 
When homeowners want to plant, they consult a landscape architect -- a task 
that gardeners such as Nakamura used to handle. When people want their trees 
trimmed, again, they hire an expert. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, it's all specialized," Nakamura said. "It's quite a change. It's a lot 
more simple." 
</P>
<P>
 It is simpler because motorized blowers have replaced hosing down the 
driveway, weed whackers have replaced hoeing and power mowers have replaced 
manual ones. Yet it remains backbreaking work that requires people to spend the 
day beneath the searing sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakamura, a farmer's son, never figured on this life. As a young man born in 
San Francisco, he set his heart on becoming an electrician or a radio 
technician. But at 23, during World War II, he was dispatched to an internment 
camp. It turned out to be the only time he could practice the trade for which 
he went to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Released after three years, Nakamura could find no work in his profession. At 
his school, he was advised to try Hawaii, a spot where he would not be 
penalized for being Asian. Instead, he came to Los Angeles, believing it would 
be more lenient. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pounded the pavement," said Nakamura, eating his lunch on the tailgate of 
his pickup parked at a Brentwood home. "I wound up a gardener." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of today's increased competition, gardeners who enter the business 
have even fewer opportunities for advancement than Nakamura's generation, 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Japanese gardeners could make decent living wages and their children 
could become properly educated," said USC's Dear. "That's not going to happen 
with the current generation of gardeners. They are locked into an employment 
ghetto because jobs are not plentiful and there's a large number of people 
waiting to take those jobs. It's more hand-to-mouth now." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Few know this dynamic better than Jose Torres. A Mexican immigrant in his 30s, 
married and the father of three with few prospects, Torres began gardening this 
year when an acquaintance retired and gave him his mower and leaf blower. 
Torres does not earn enough to have a telephone at home, or to pay his friend 
who occasionally propels the unwieldy mower at one of the three homes that 
Torres maintains. Struggling to feed his children, he also works as a dinner 
cook in a Culver City restaurant, a job he much prefers to yardwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Pausing to watch his friend mow a yard in Brentwood, Torres shakes his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry I got into this," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro Frias is not sorry. All he has to do is remember Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 After laboring as a gardener for five years on USC's grounds, Frias, 46, 
decided to launch his own business. He has worked on his own as a gardener for 
five years. Before turning to gardening, he was a night janitor, but he prefers 
daylight hours and being outside, even if he makes only $10,000 to $15,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care if it's lowly work -- it's work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frias, who went only to the first grade in Mexico, has struggled all his life. 
His father died when he was an infant, leaving Frias' mother to care for the 
couple's seven children. She worked washing clothing by hand and planting corn 
in the fields. At age 5, Frias usually accompanied her. She would cook a 
handful of beans and ladle out watery soup to her hungry children. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, by dint of saving, Frias owns a small cottage in south Los Angeles. 
Working by himself, he tends four yards a day in communities including Sierra 
Madre and San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care if I don't have good clothes. I don't care about eating beef," 
Frias said. "I always have enough for food. I don't need too much money." 
</P>
<P>
 One time Frias was fixing a sprinkler when he slipped and fell, cutting open 
his forehead on a corner of a house. Blood poured down his face. When Frias 
arrived home, his wife saw the flap of skin hanging loosely on his forehead and 
insisted that he go to the hospital emergency room. He got 10 stitches, then 
went back to work. Like so many gardeners, he has taken an oath: His children 
will lead better lives. 
</P>
<P>
 That wish came true for Jose Flores, 69, still gardening in the neighborhoods 
of San Marino. "If you don't want to work like me," he would tell his three 
children, "you have to go to college." 
</P>
<P>
 His boys all graduated from UCLA, the eldest becoming an engineer, the next a 
doctor and the third a computer technician. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am proud," Flores says, beaming. "But I have no more helpers."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; A PLACE FOR TEE IN THE EVENING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Golf, admittedly, is a difficult game, a psychological roller coaster where 
frustrations can surge at the slightest miscue. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, putting a tiny ball in a tiny hole from distances of several 
hundred yards wasn't meant to be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Now try the same feat at night and it's about as hard as hitting a hole-in-one 
-- for some golfers, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "My boss is making me play," lamented Tom Chatterton, 30, of Garden Grove, who 
was shooting a game with some friends one recent night at David L. Baker Golf 
Course in Fountain Valley. "My work is having a tournament next Sunday and I 
don't want to look totally pathetic." 
</P>
<P>
 The golf course, at Edinger and Ward streets, is just one of two that offers 
night golf in Orange County, the other being Newport Beach Golf Course, near 
John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 But what kind of person would willingly walk around a golf course in chilly 
temperatures under bright halogen lights to have a whack at a Topflite? 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy who works all day and doesn't have a chance to play during the day, 
naturally," said Joe Cannon, the manager and head professional at Baker, which, 
was named after the Fountain Valley councilman who came up with the idea of 
bringing a night golf course to town. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker persuaded the county, which owns the property, to put the land up for 
lease. But he never lived to see the project become reality. The course was 
named in his honor on May 6, 1986, when the first round of night golf was 
played, said Jim Caspio, the assistant manager of the course. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since, night golf has become a popular event that is played as late as 9 
p.m., when the lights go out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets a little bit cold at night, so we don't have that many people playing 
in the winter," Caspio said. "But in the summertime we've gotten as many 100 
players at night. A lot of people tee off late, just before sunset, then keep 
on playing once the lights kick on." 
</P>
<P>
 Golf aficionados have been known to turn out in droves at the Newport Beach 
Golf Course, at Irvine Avenue and Mesa Drive. It's open from 6:30 a.m. to 10 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't a light system in the world that's going to compete with the sun, 
but this is the next best thing," said one employee at the course. 
</P>
<P>
 Night golf isn't a new concept -- it's been around since the late 1940s. 
Generally, golf courses with lights are only par threes and fours, known as 
executive golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good way to work on your shorter clubs," says Pat Petty, the boss who 
was forcing Chatterton to play in the tournament for the sake of employee 
pride. "I don't hit my woods out here." 
</P>
<P>
 Don Moberly, 51, of Fountain Valley, who just took up the game and played a 
few nocturnal rounds at Baker, had a tip for those considering night golf: "If 
you don't know where the lakes are and you hook left or right, you might as 
well forget your ball."TOM RAGAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; FEE WAIVER DENIED FOR REBUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has decided not to waive $2,000 in building permit fees for a 
man whose house was severely damaged in a February, 1993, landslide along La 
Ventana. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted unanimously last week against the waiver of the fee, which 
would have been the first such consideration granted by the city, planning 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Shikli, who is rebuilding his house at 2813 La Ventana, had first asked 
the city's Community Development Department for the fee waiver, but staffers 
there said that they did not have the authority to decide. 
</P>
<P>
 A bluff west of La Ventana collapsed in February, 1993, sending tons of soil 
and debris onto Pacific Coast Highway. Four houses were lost in the landslide. 
</P>
<P>
 A $3.1-million project to shore up the bluff and clear the highway started in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
 It is scheduled to be finished at the end of next month. JEFF BEAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; ACTION ON STUART DRIVE PARKING BAN DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council consideration of a Police Department proposal to prohibit street 
parking on Stuart Drive has been delayed until February. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Bruce A. Broadwater recommended sending the proposal back to the Traffic 
Commission for further study after about a dozen apartment owners and residents 
showed up at a council meeting last week to protest the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 No one spoke before the council, but in interviews later, the apartment owners 
said the plan to prohibit street parking was "discriminatory." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of turning our neighborhood to a ghetto," said Linda Johnson, who 
owns a 10-unit apartment rented mostly to Latino tenants. "We feel like we're 
unwanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Police proposed blocking off Rockinghorse Road south of Stuart and imposing 
the street parking ban to discourage drug-dealing, auto thefts and improve 
traffic safety in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 A city study in September indicated that at least 575 off-street parking 
spaces are available, but garages are being used for storage, and others have 
people living in them. 
</P>
<P>
 On any night, about 180 vehicles are parked on the street, which could 
accommodate only about 145 vehicles, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 This creates safety problems and slows the movement of ambulances and fire 
trucks responding to medical emergencies, the police said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vincent Vanderburgh, owner of a 16-unit apartment, said that eliminating 
street parking will not help solve crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is overpopulation," said Vanderburgh, adding that it's a citywide 
problem, and picking Stuart Drive was "discriminatory." BERT ELJERAGARDEN GROVE

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; ORDINANCE ALLOWS CITY TO ASK BINGO 
AUDITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A new city ordinance allows denial of a permit to hold games if an 
organization has violated state or local bingo laws in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the revised ordinance recently adopted by the City Council allows 
the city to require an audit of a bingo organization's financial records at the 
group's expense, City Atty.Alan R. Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bingo ordinance revisions will go into effect immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 The city could require an audit if it wanted to verify an organization's 
expenses relating to bingo games and to ensure money is going toward charitable 
causes, Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department or city Finance Department are not able to perform the 
financial audit to verify contributions and expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, however, an independent audit will not be required because most 
bingo games are put on by small local high school booster clubs and other local 
charities, Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
 City forms for bingo permits will also be revised to provide more information 
about the use of bingo money. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said changes in the ordinance will help the city make sure that only 
legitimate bingo operations are conducted here. 
</P>
<P>
 According to city officials, one organization conducting bingo games in the 
city has been found to have commingled bingo money and paid salaries from bingo 
proceeds, violating state and local bingo laws.DEBRA CANO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: TRABUCO CANYON; SOME IN PORTOLA HILLS GET WATER RATE HIKE 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Water rates will go up 15% Sunday for more than 500 homes in Portola Hills 
that are served by the Trabuco Canyon Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate change is higher than a 5% increase for the rest of the district's 
2,600 customers, but Portola Hills residents will still have the lowest rates 
in the district, said district Treasurer Hershal Skidmore. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is to bring them a little closer," Skidmore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both rate increases were approved by the board of directors last June when 
they adopted a 1994-95 budget, Skidmore said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15% increase for Portola Hills residents was necessary because state 
officials have taken away property tax revenue that helped underwrite the cost 
of providing water to customers there, Skidmore said. JEFF BEAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; SCHOOL'S SURF TEAM TO COMPETE IN 
WORLDWIDE CONTEST IN AUSTRALIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven teen-age surfers from Huntington Beach High School's championship surf 
team will leave Orange County on Wednesday for more than two weeks of 
competition in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Andy Verdone arranged the trip after Principal Jim Staunton received 
district approval allowing the students two weeks' leave.They are scheduled to 
return Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time a surf team I've coached has ever been allowed to 
travel on school time," said Verdone, who has been coach for six years. 
"Usually, we travel only during the summer." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Townend, a local celebrity and former world surfing champion from 
Australia now living in Westminster, helped organize the trip. The team's main 
competition will be at the Hot Buttered Pro, a premier international surfing 
event for amateur and professional surfers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huntington Beach High School surf team is the defending state champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Staunton acknowledged that surfing, although not as popular as football or 
baseball, has certainly "come of age" at coastal high school campuses in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 But that wasn't the primary reason for his support, Staunton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a prestigious event," he said. "And our team was honored to be 
invited to a worldwide contest. We had no choice on the date, but it just 
happened to be Australia's summer." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach surfers selected for the trip are Wyatt Simmons, 18; Mikey 
Reilly, 17; Justin Harcharic, 17; Andy Hobson, 17; Ben Will, 17; Ryan Turner, 
15, and Matt Shadbolt, 16. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, several other amateur surfers from California and Hawaii are 
expected to join Verdone and the team in Australia. 
</P>

8 CRITICALLY INJURED IN 2-CAR CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight people, four of them children, were critically injured in a high-speed 
collision at a Reseda intersection Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 When firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene moments after the 7:45 
p.m. crash at Sherman Way and Louise Avenue, they found some of the victims 
trapped in the vehicles -- a Chevy Blazer and a station wagon -- and others in 
the street and on the grass nearby, bloodied and unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
 The children were rushed to nearby Van Nuys Airport, from which Los Angeles 
Fire Department helicopters airlifted two of them to Childrens Hospital of Los 
Angeles and two to UCLA Medical Center, department spokesman Brian Humphrey 
said. The adults were sent to various hospitals and a ninth person was being 
treated for less severe injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Regina Birdsell, a spokeswoman for Childrens Hospital, said the two victims 
taken there were boys between ages 3 and 6 who had been thrown from a vehicle. 
"They were not wearing seat belts," she said.

GIRL, 17, FATALLY SHOT; YOUTH SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pomona police continued to search late Monday for a teen-age boy wanted for 
questioning in connection with the death of a 17-year-old girl who was shot 
while spending Christmas night at a friend's house.  
</P>
<P>
 Pomona Police Lt. Larry Todd identified the victim as Mary Price of 
Pomona.Todd described the boy being sought by police as a 15- to 17-year-old 
Pomona resident who was an acquaintance of the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim's 14-year-old friend initially told investigators that they were 
alone in the home and that she did not know how the shooting occurred. But she 
later said a young man was visiting at the time of the incident, Pomona Police 
Lt. Louie Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez said it is unclear whether the young man was invited to the house. 
He had fled by the time police arrived, and it had not been determined whether 
he was responsible for the shooting or was merely a witness, Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have not determined a motive for the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger girl, who has not been identified because of her age, called 
police about 9:30 p.m. Sunday, saying her friend had been shot in the head. 
Price had been spending the night, and her friend's parents had left the girls 
alone while they went to a party, Hernandez said.

 Orange County Fair officials said they will start all over again in their 
efforts to negotiate a contract with a carnival operator for the next three 
annual fairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair board initially planned to award the three-year carnival contract to 
Ray Cammack Shows of Laveen, Ariz., which has worked with the Los Angeles 
County Fair for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 But B&B Amusements of Yuma, Ariz., which has provided rides at the Orange 
County Fair for the past 10 years, filed a protest, alleging the bidding 
process was flawed, fair General Manager Becky Bailey-Findley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair board maintained that it followed correct procedures but said that 
B&B could have misinterpreted them. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the dispute would have taken several months to resolve, the fair board 
opted to reject all bids and start over, Bailey-Findley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new request for proposals will make clear the procedures regarding a 
disputed point, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bidders will be scored on a 100-point scale with different point values 
possible in several categories, Bailey-Findley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The criteria include the operator's financial stability and offer, based on 
the sharing of profits and willingness to build fair improvements; the 
operator's safety record; the quality and quantity of rides, games, shows and 
other concessions; management's labor practices; customer service practices, 
and the operator's experience and performance over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair board hopes to have the new request for proposal forms ready for 
distribution by the end of the week and to select a company by the end of 
January, Bailey-Findley said. HOLLY J. WAGNER

 A businessman has asked the City Council to adopt a policy that would give 
preferential treatment to local businesses when awarding city contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do business with businesses that don't pay for a city business license or 
pay sales tax here?" asked Anton Groot, a former city councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 Groot suggested that the city create a purchasing department using current 
employees, develop vendor lists of local businesses interested in bidding on 
city business and grant a credit to local businesses bidding on city projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Groot, whose wife owns a trophy store, said the city routinely buys items that 
are sold by local merchants from businesses in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Mark Schwing asked City Manager Arthur C. Simonian and City 
Atty. Leonard Hampel to report back to the council on Groot's suggestions at 
the next meeting of the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a good point," Schwing said. The city should "give priority to local 
businesses if they are competitive." DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; COUNCIL APPROVES FEE HIKES AT CITY 
STABLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Equestrians who board their horses at the city's Central Park stables will pay 
higher fees starting in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council recently approved a fee increase, despite objections from 
horse owners who believe the hike is unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
 The new boarding rates include a $20 increase to $340 a month for a 
12-by-12-foot box stall with a tack locker, and a $15 increase to $240 a month 
for a 12-by-24-foot pipe corral with a tack locker. 
</P>
<P>
 Other increases include: a new $35 fee for trailer parking; a $35 increase to 
$280 for a 24-by-24-foot pipe corral, and a $30 increase to $450 to keep a 
horse in the show barn. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said there has not been a fee increase in boarding prices since 
January, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The operator of Huntington Central Park Equestrian Center requested the fee 
increase because of increased costs of running the facility, including higher 
costs for hay and shavings.

MAN, 21, CRITICALLY INJURED IN SANTA ANA SHOOTING; VIOLENCE: HE AND TWO OTHER 
VICTIMS WERE CRUISING THE STREETS WHEN THEY WERE STOPPED AND FIRED UPON IN WHAT 
POLICE BELIEVE TO BE A GANG-RELATED INCIDENT.

 A 21-year-old Inglewood man was clinging to life Monday after he and two other 
young men were shot in a barrage of gunfire on a Santa Ana street, authorities 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergio Jaime was airlifted to UCI Medical Center in Orange after he was shot 
in the head and chest at 1:16 a.m. Monday in the 1400 block of South Rene 
Drive, Santa Ana police said. Jaime's 20-year-old brother, Richard, and 
20-year-old Cesar Mejia, also of Inglewood, were shot in the arms and legs, but 
their injuries are not believed to be life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe the shooting was gang-related and that the victims were 
cruising the streets of southwestern Santa Ana, a Sunday night tradition.  
</P>
<P>
 The three men and two other friends were driving on Rene Drive when they were 
stopped by several youths in another car, police said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Sergio Jaime and the other four men were challenged about their gang 
membership," Sgt. George Kopitch said. "He and the passengers said they were 
from Inglewood, and that reply met with gunfire."  
</P>
<P>
 The assailants fired 10 to 15 shots before driving away, and police said they 
have no suspects and recovered no weapons.  
</P>
<P>
 Police said car enthusiasts and often gang members from throughout Southern 
California continue a tradition of cruising the neighborhoods around Bristol 
Street and Edinger Avenue on Sunday nights, despite a crackdown by police.  
</P>
<P>
 "We do have some cruiser enforcement going on, but that doesn't stop the 
cruising," Kopitch said. "Last night was proof of it, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 About a year ago, 100 officers from 13 Orange County police agencies fanned 
out in the city's cruising zone, trying to curb the practice by stopping cars 
and questioning passengers. Officers arrested drivers for vehicle infractions, 
possession of alcohol and other offenses in an attempt to deter cruisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana police have said that for the past few years, Sunday nights have 
routinely brought 1,000 to 3,000 cars to a six-block stretch of Bristol Street, 
turning it into a virtual parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 But when police turn their attention to Bristol, the drivers clog residential 
neighborhoods instead, according to some neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Police don't consider it a high priority, but they should do something," said 
a 24-year-old resident who asked not to be identified. "It's pretty dangerous. 
Some of (the cruisers) are intoxicated. Unless they cut down on cruising, this 
kind of thing leads to fights." 
</P>
<P>
 On a cruising night last March, a 20-year-old Long Beach man was shot and 
killed after an argument between passengers of two cars in the 1500 block of 
South Bristol Street. The victim was a member of a Compton gang, his friends 
told police.  
</P>
<P>
 Monday's incident was the third serious shooting in about 72 hours in Santa 
Ana. A 19-year-old college student was gunned down early Saturday after being 
chased by unknown assailants, and a Garden Grove man was shot and killed late 
Friday night as he sat in a car parked outside a Santa Ana convenience store.

PAINT MERCHANT PLEADS TO FLY MORE BANNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Larry LaCasse, the owner of two paint stores in the city, wants to put up more 
banners to let customers know about coming sales. 
</P>
<P>
 But under the city's sign ordinance, he said, he is only allowed to put up 14 
banners every three months.If he tries to sneak one by code enforcement and 
puts up one more than he's supposed to, he said, city officials are all over 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's insane," LaCasse said. "I'm getting threats of prosecution and 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 So LaCasse last week took his complaint to the City Council, where he spoke 
for 12 other business owners in Costa Mesa who oppose the banner restrictions 
and seek a change in policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our entire life savings are on the line," he told the council during a public 
hearing. "Putting up signs one day a week is not enough." 
</P>
<P>
 LaCasse said the banners stimulate business, and he asked the council to 
consider amending the policy to allow 36 banners every three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry Valantine, the city's planning manager, said that if the sign ordinance 
is to be amended, it will take place at the Planning Commission meeting on Jan. 
9. But he said the idea behind the 14 banners per quarter is to regulate the 
amount of signs in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Otherwise you defeat the sign ordinance," he said. "It's just not the kind of 
thing that improves the image of the city if everybody is flying a banner all 
the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Valantine said restrictions have become less stringent over the years. It used 
to be that businesses could only put up the 30 banners a year, but now they are 
allowed to let them fly 56 times a year.TOM RAGAN

 Kathleen M. Morrison owns a condo in California that she can't afford to 
furnish and a house in Wisconsin that she fears she can't afford to sell.  
</P>
<P>
 The 48-year-old Garden Grove resident, a secretary for Veterans Affairs, says 
she has no plans to return to the Midwestern town where her sister and parents 
live. She is renting out the home she owns there and getting a tax break on it. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to know what the ramifications are of selling it," said Morrison, 
who admits to being an amateur at money management. She began considering her 
own financial future only recently, she said, when her parents retired. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at them living on Social Security, and they are barely making it," she 
said. "My father is in his 70s and still doing part-time jobs because they need 
the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrison would like to plan prudently for her own retirement, but she has 
little money to spare. Her condominium, which she bought less than a year ago, 
is only partly furnished. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have all the basics -- microwave, table, chairs, television -- but there 
are a few things I would like to do," Morrison said, possibly with the proceeds 
from selling the Wisconsin house. "I would like to redo the kitchen because it 
is real dated. And I'd like to buy furniture for the living room. Right now I 
have a box for an end table." 
</P>
<P>
 For advice on how to proceed, Morrison met with Laura Tarbox, a Costa Mesa 
certified financial planner. Mark Taylor, a San Clemente-based certified 
financial planner, also commented on her situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a general rule," Tarbox said, "it is not a good idea to sell an investment 
to spend." If Morrison were to sell the Wisconsin house, Tarbox said, the 
temptation to use all of the proceeds right away would be great, and an 
important source of investment income would fly out the window. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarbox pointed out how Morrison's rental property is paying off for her. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The house rents for $1,000 a month. After paying her mortgage and fees to a 
property management company, Morrison clears $180 a month that, over the course 
of a year, adds more than $2,000 to her annual salary of about $26,300. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, the house gives Morrison a tax break that amounts to several thousand 
dollars a year, Tarbox said. "To get the same return, 10%, she would have to 
find another high-return investment." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, however, pointed out that owning real estate can be tricky. Property 
managers don't always have the landlord's best interests in mind, he said, and 
tenants are not always careful with the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially in Morrison's case, Taylor said, keeping a watchful eye on her 
rental house is difficult because she lives in a different state. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least she is dealing with a familiar situation, he said. "She has 
something that has worked for her for years, so if she doesn't mind the hassle, 
maybe she should keep it." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrison said she will probably do just that. "I don't have a good reason to 
sell it," she said. And the tax breaks and rental income do increase her 
spending power. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Taylor and Tarbox agreed that Morrison should try to diversify her 
investments more as she plans for retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her rental house and Garden Grove condo, Morrison has $15,000 
in an individual retirement account and $13,600 in a 401(k) savings account 
that is invested mostly in government securities. She adds $300 a month to 
those funds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Morrison's portfolio, Tarbox said, is typical for people new to investing. "It 
is very common that people are investing too conservatively for retirement," 
she said, "because the investments are considered safe." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, Morrison's home in Wisconsin is outperforming her other 
holdings by quite a lot. Her IRA and 401(k) accounts are earning her just over 
4% a year. Tarbox advised that she consider boosting her returns by entering a 
new arena: the stock market. In the long run, Tarbox said, stockholders 
generally reap higher profits than do other types of investors. 
</P>
<P>
 If Morrison does add stocks to her portfolio, Tarbox said, she might consider 
no-load mutual funds and also an international fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor recommended that Morrison put at least 50% of her capital in stocks. By 
doing so, he said, she may be able to boost her annual return to as much as 
10%. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was doing a pretty good job of investing," Morrison said after 
listening to the experts. But, she added, "I can see where doing it 
conservatively does not always get you what you need."

 A Taste for Safety: The Compton Police Department is playing chicken this 
holiday season with a little help from Irvine-based El Pollo Loco. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good drivers usually do not get rewards for their safe driving," Police Chief 
Hourie L. Taylor said. "The public's perception of being stopped by the police 
is usually negative, with the receipt of a traffic citation as the result." 
</P>
<P>
 During December, however, Compton police officers also stopped safe drivers 
and rewarded them with gift certificates redeemable at El Pollo Loco 
restaurants. The reward program ran through Christmas Day.

8 CRITICALLY INJURED IN 2-CAR CRASH; ACCIDENT: VEHICLES COLLIDE IN A VAN NUYS 
INTERSECTION. FOUR OF THE MOST SERIOUSLY HURT VICTIMS ARE CHILDREN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Eight people, including four children, were critically injured Monday night 
when two vehicles collided in what authorities said was one of the worst 
traffic accidents in years in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 When rescuers arrived moments after the 7:45 p.m. crash at Sherman Way and 
Louise Avenue, they found some of the victims trapped in the vehicles -- a 
Chevy Blazer and a station wagon -- and others in the street and on the grass 
nearby, bloodied and unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is about as bad as they get," Assistant Fire Chief John Callahan said of 
the collision. "I haven't seen eight critical patients in quite some time." 
</P>
<P>
 The children were rushed to Van Nuys Airport, where Los Angeles Fire 
Department helicopters flew two of them to Childrens Hospital Los Angeles and 
the two others to UCLA Medical Center, city Fire Department spokesman Brian 
Humphrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The adults were sent to three Valley hospitals and a ninth victim was being 
treated for less severe injuries, firefighters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Childrens Hospital spokeswoman Regina Birdsell said the two injured children 
taken there were boys ages 3 and 4 who had been thrown from a vehicle. "They 
were not wearing seat belts," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger boy may lose an arm, Humphrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other children -- a boy and a girl, both 9 -- suffered head and chest 
injuries. The adults included two women between the ages of 20 and 35 and two 
men, about 30 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Callahan described the injuries of all eight victims as potentially 
life-threatening. "They could go either way," he said at the scene. "Certainly, 
with the speed of the response and the quality of the care at the hospitals 
they are going to, we're hoping for the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said it was too early to tell Monday evening the cause of the 
collision or whether one of the vehicles ran a red light, as suggested by at 
least one paramedic on the scene. Several witnesses reported hearing no 
screeching of brakes before the accident. The Blazer also appeared to have 
struck a utility pole head-on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard the crash . . . and saw that vehicle flip," said neighbor Jayne 
Lipscomb, who was driving by when the collision occurred. "It was the loudest 
crash I have ever heard. It was just horrifying." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they did not know if alcohol or drugs were involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Capt. Pat Klein, who also lives in the area, said the intersection has 
been the scene of so many collisions that police had stepped up enforcement 
efforts to catch speeding motorists. He said he was one of the first to arrive 
at the scene and attended to a 29-year-old woman in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our best guess is that seven people were in the Blazer and two in the station 
wagon," Callahan said. "We assume they are related, but we do not know what the 
relations were." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the seriously injured adults were transported by ambulance to Holy 
Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills, while the other two were taken to 
Northridge Hospital Medical Center. The other adult was taken to Valley 
Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the extensive damage to both vehicles indicated at least one 
of them was traveling at a high rate of speed. Traffic specialists from the Los 
Angeles Police Department were at the scene to begin an investigation.

WALKWAYS IN THE WILDERNESS; TRAILBLAZER MAKES SURE HIS GENTLY CUT PATHS 'LAY 
LIGHTLY ON THE LAND' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Ron Webster figures that if he does his job right, no one will notice. 
Webster, you see, is a master trail builder -- one of a small fraternity of 
backcountry enthusiasts who hack walkways out of the wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to build them so that people don't think they're walking on a trail," 
said Webster. "I want them to think they're just walking in the woods." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who walks in the woods of Los Angeles County has most likely traveled 
one of the hundreds of miles of mountain trail designed, built or maintained by 
Webster over the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past 10 of those years, Webster, 61, has been employed full-time as a 
professional trail builder, spending much of his time on the nearly complete 
65-mile Backbone Trail that winds its way across the twisted spine of the Santa 
Monica Mountains from Will Rogers State Park in Pacific Palisades to Point 
Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 Webster's vocation is an arcane pursuit, one in which an instinctive feel for 
the flow of a mountainside is as important as a working knowledge of 
hydrodynamics, and the ability to work in solitude for days at a time is as 
critical as skill with an ax. 
</P>
<P>
 Webster, with salt-and-pepper hair and a pair of tanned, leathery hands that 
come from a lifetime of hard work, is considered a master of the trade, though 
the distinction embarrasses him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The joke is, they won't pay someone who sort of knows what he is doing. They 
want to pay an expert -- 'a trail master.' It makes me cringe," Webster said, 
huffing along the Solstice Canyon Trail above Malibu one recent morning. 
</P>
<P>
 His is an expertise that comes largely from years of just walking around the 
mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of trail manuals and schools," said Webster. "I didn't go to 
any of them. But I remember something that lots of trail builders forget: The 
trail should lay lightly on the land." 
</P>
<P>
 Webster drifted into the job in a roundabout way. He wasn't particularly 
outdoorsy, but in the 1970s, the father of three wanted his children to be 
exposed to the outdoors, so he began attending Sierra Club hikes. He soon 
became a volunteer hike leader and in the late 1970s he was instrumental in 
volunteer efforts to build the one-mile Musch Ranch Trail on some newly 
acquired public lands and to maintain existing trails. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years later, at the age of 51, Webster lost his job as a machinist. At 
the same time, the Mountains Conservancy and its related organizations were 
launching an aggressive trail-construction campaign. "I needed a job and they 
wanted trails," Webster said. "So it all sort of fit together." 
</P>
<P>
 Webster's $24,000 salary is paid under a grant awarded to the Trails Council, 
which is affiliated with the Mountains Conservancy and the Conservancy 
Foundation. These organizations, along with the Sierra Club, work in 
conjunction with a patchwork of federal, state and local park agencies that 
acquire and maintain public lands in the local mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Most trails in Southern California are man-made and of recent origin. The old 
Indian, Spanish and pioneer corridors have long since been paved over. The 
pockets of wilderness that still exist in the Los Angeles Basin are generally 
the toughest, most severe landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are the places where Webster now plies his trade. But while the terrain 
is tough, Webster applies a gentle touch to his work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good when you can't see my trail," said Webster, looking across a 
canyon at the seamless face of the opposite slope where the missing brush is 
hard to notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some of the nation's celebrated trail builders, Webster doesn't use 
bulldozers or other heavy equipment. Alone, or with a crew of six or eight, 
Webster relies on a simple collection of broad-bladed McCleod hoes, sharp 
Pulaski axes, and Forest Service-style picks to pare back the thick chaparral 
and chip away at the notoriously hard, dry turf of the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Webster starts the process of building new trail by studying topographic maps 
and then bushwhacking around the area. Once he's settled on a general course, 
he takes off across the mountain, leaving a series of flags to mark the 
proposed path. The crew, usually including Webster, then chops down and clears 
out brush, removes rock, and cuts into the slope of the hill to create a flat 
footpath. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Webster's simple but overriding principles in these ventures is: "Never 
build trail people won't use." 
</P>
<P>
 That means keeping the severity of the incline to an easy average of 10 
degrees, and designing as many loop trails -- ones that begin and end at the 
same place -- as possible. "That's what people want," Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilderness purists are more interested in lengthy, destination trail projects 
like the Backbone Trail, but Webster says that despite the inviting prospect of 
taking a week to traverse that trail, most hikers will do it in small sections, 
one day hike at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Kilday, executive director of the Mountains Conservancy Foundation, says 
Webster's trails are distinctive because of his knack for winding them by the 
prettiest or most unusual features of a mountain -- a rock formation, creek or 
striking tree. 
</P>
<P>
 "He designs to the fullest advantage" of the terrain, said Kilday. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the digging and cutting has been performed by Sierra Club volunteers. 
"The best volunteers aren't the guys who come out talking about how they love 
nature," said Webster. "It's the guys who just like to get dirty and see 
something get done." 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, the volunteer efforts have been buttressed with paid crews from 
the Los Angeles Conservation Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 Webster is clearly at home in these surroundings. He moves easily along the 
trail, with the steady sure-footedness of a veteran woodsman. 
</P>
<P>
 His hands constantly reach down and quickly snip off twigs and leaves from the 
hardy shrubs that line the pathway. When asked if his habit is a form of 
ongoing trail maintenance, Webster shrugged, "No, I'm just fidgety." 
</P>
<P>
 He's a friendly, talkative man, who easily maintains a constant patter of 
rambling explanations, anecdotes and notes on points of interest as he escorts 
a visitor along a Malibu-area trail. 
</P>
<P>
 But to some questions, Webster responds with uncharacteristically direct and 
succinct answers. 
</P>
<P>
 You like your work, don't you? "Yes," he said plainly. Have you ever 
considered giving it up and getting a real job? "No," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a while he added: "I've got a job that I hear dozens of people say, 
'God, I'd like to have a job like yours.' But you know what? Probably not." 
</P>
<P>
 Webster then ticked off the occupational hazards: poison oak, mountain lions, 
Valley fever and the generally dirty, backbreaking nature of the work. 
</P>
<P>
 And the isolation. "A lot of people can't handle the hours and hours of being 
alone, but I look forward to it," said Webster. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, there's the Mountain Tax. "Everyone who works in the mountains pays the 
Mountain Tax," Webster said. "That means you don't make any money." 
</P>
<P>
 While grants and other funding sources are never secure for long, there's 
little question of how much work there is to be done. Just maintaining existing 
trail is an enormous job, Webster notes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you stop maintaining trail, it's incredible how fast Mother Nature can 
chew it up and spit it down the mountain," said Webster. Even new trail doesn't 
stay put long. "By the time you get to the end, the beginning has already 
changed."

THE YEAR IN REVIEW: REVISITING THE NOTABLE VALLEY EVENTS OF 1994; MCKEON, THE 
FRIEND OF NEWT; CONGRESS: RELATIVE NEWCOMER GAINED CLOUT AS VETERAN MOORHEAD 
WAS BYPASSED FOR TWO CHOICE CHAIRMANSHIPS.

<P>
 When Republicans took control of the House of Representatives last month, the 
last-quarter political bang empowered two San Fernando Valley congressmen, with 
one upstart lawmaker winning far more than his veteran cross-town colleague. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprising political analysts, seniority seemed to fall by the wayside when 
Rep. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita), relatively new to the Congress, 
emerged with as much clout as the dean of the state's Republican delegation, 
Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead of Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men now have subcommittee chairmanships, important posts that their 
Democratic colleagues lost. But with House Speaker-designate Newt Gingrich 
(R-Ga.) calling the shots, McKeon appears to have achieved another critical 
designation that Moorhead has not -- Friend of Newt. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead had been waiting years for such a Republican landslide, and he spent 
election night mulling over which of two chairmanships he would take -- the 
Energy and Commerce Committee, which handles matters affecting virtually all U. 
S. businesses, or the prestigious Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a congressman's dream. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gingrich put a crimp in Moorhead's plans. Consolidating power, Gingrich 
ignored the seniority system and named some of his own backers as committee 
chairmen instead. 
</P>
<P>
 In essence, Moorhead -- regarded by Gingrich as insufficiently aggressive -- 
was out. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11-term congressman still received a subcommittee chairmanship dealing 
with copyright and trademark issues, which will give him a gavel and the clout 
to control the flow of legislation for the first time in his career. But 
political analysts see the development as a humiliating blow. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead, for his part, is philosophical about being bypassed, comparing the 
new Congress to a football team and saying he had been asked to block. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon, on the other hand, emerged with a smile on his face. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-term lawmaker lobbied hard to retain some of the prominence he gained 
over the last two years as the Republican freshman class president. It paid 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 He was appointed to the House National Security Committee, a high-profile post 
that will allow him to aid the ailing aerospace industry. And he became a 
subcommittee chairman, too, winning the top job on the subcommittee on 
post-secondary education, training and lifelong learning. He also participated 
in Gingrich's transition team preparing for the start of the 104th Congress on 
Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Valley Republicans will have increased legislative clout as their party 
flexes its muscles in 1995. But Moorhead, the veteran, has agreed to allow his 
more activist colleagues to lead the charge, while McKeon, the newcomer, 
continues his push to become a part of the mix.

FALLEN CLIMBER IN SERIOUS CONDITION 
</P>

<P>
 A Glendale man plunged 45 feet from a popular rock-climbing formation in 
Chatsworth on Monday, nearly severing his foot, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The spectacular 2 p.m. fall from Stoney Point, on Topanga Canyon Boulevard 
near the Simi Valley Freeway, was witnessed by several climbers taking 
advantage of the post-Christmas day off, Los Angeles Fire Department officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "According to witnesses, he fell nearly 45 feet and landed on his feet," said 
fire spokesman Brian Humphrey. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, who was airlifted to Northridge Hospital Medical Center, sustained 
a fractured right ankle and a possible collapsed lung, said Humphrey. The 
climber's identity was withheld by officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The rough terrain and severity of the injuries prompted firefighters to 
airlift the man to the hospital trauma unit, where he was reported in serious 
condition before undergoing surgery Monday afternoon, Humphrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics at the scene saw no evidence that the victim was using ropes or 
other safety tackle during the climb, said Humphrey. At least two people saw 
the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The rock formation, jutting up from the east side of Topanga Canyon Boulevard 
near Santa Susana Pass Road, is frequented by local climbers and hikers and has 
been the scene of several accidents, most of them minor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's rather common for us to go out there," said Humphrey. "We're often 
called out there to rescue climbers and recreational hikers." GEOFFREY MOHAN

THE YEAR IN REVIEW: THE COUNTY'S VISUAL ARTS SCENE ACCELERATED ITS SLIDE INTO 
SAFETLY AND DULLNESS; 1994: THE YEAR IN REVIEW ; THE UPSTARTS OUTNUMBERED BY 
THE DOWNTURNS 
</P>

<P>
 Looking for the silver lining department? Sorry, better skip this space. With 
a few brave exceptions, the Orange County art scene accelerated its slide into 
safety, dullness and sparser offerings in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a decade -- up until this past spring -- strong artistic 
leadership from either the Newport Harbor Art Museum or the Laguna Art Museum 
could be counted on to invigorate the scene. Not only were the quality of the 
shows and the creative direction of top staff exciting, but they also served as 
benchmarks for smaller art institutions battling conservative boards or city 
managements. 
</P>
<P>
 The firing of Laguna Art Museum director Charles Desmarais in March -- four 
years and four months after groundbreaking director Kevin Consey left Newport 
Harbor -- suddenly changed that picture. Now the unwritten rules at both 
museums seem to be: Don't make waves, worry more about the bottom line than 
fostering creativity (as if the two were mutually exclusive), and try to make 
the public happy by anticipating what you think it wants. 
</P>
<P>
 In the time Desmarais spent at the Laguna Beach museum, he turned a provincial 
institution into one increasingly respected by artists, curators, critics and 
others looking for sophisticated fare. He accomplished this primarily by 
curating such fresh and stimulating exhibitions as "Proof" and "Why I Got Into 
TV and Other Stories: The Art of Ilene Segalove," and by importing traveling 
shows highlighting major contemporary trends or offering a historical context 
for art of other periods. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these traveling shows -- such as "Commodity Image: Photography, 
Sculpture, Installation" and "Augustus Vincent Tack: Landscape of the Spirit" 
-- enlivened the museum's schedule months after he left. But his departure did 
postpone the one show that was to have been the museum's -- and perhaps Orange 
County's -- leading art experience of the year: a pioneering retrospective of 
abstract painter John McLaughlin, now scheduled for 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Laguna's trustees seem to have been curiously blind to the 
importance of art-inspired leadership at this juncture of the museum's history. 
One trustee even has remarked that the next director should be a "businessman," 
as if fiscal prudence -- in which Desmarais was not deficient -- was the 
primary marker of a successful educational and cultural institution. 
Considering how many intriguing shows are circulated nationally by exhibition 
services and museums, it is doubtful that Desmarais would have scheduled "Lit 
From Within," a feel-good space filler that has nothing new to say about a type 
of artifact -- Amish quilts -- widely shown for two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna board, which has remained secretive about its reasons for 
dismissing Desmarais, expects to appoint a successor by the end of January. 
Meanwhile, the former director has moved on to other things: teaching art 
history at Cal State Fullerton and serving as consulting director of the Robert 
Gumbiner Foundation for the Arts in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 At Newport Harbor, the year was quiet -- too much so, alas. On the exhibition 
front, the most promising offering also was the most disappointing. "The 
Essential Gesture," chief curator Bruce Guenther's second full-scale show in 
the three years he has been at the museum (after last year's "Fourth Newport 
Biennial: Southern California"), was chockablock with representative sculptures 
by widely known artists but entirely lacked a fresh perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 Strangely, the most rewarding show at Newport Harbor in 1994 may have been a 
small group of large paintings by lyrical Abstract Expressionist Joan Mitchell, 
sparked by the need to offer something "French" (the American artist lived in 
France for many years) to complement the theme of a museum fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 Administratively speaking, other than a rearrangement of staff duties and 
hours -- and the departure of two staff members for other jobs barely a year 
after they arrived -- there was little news. Ed Prohaska, assistant director of 
finance and chief financial officer, moved on to the Pacific Asia Museum in 
Pasadena; Louise Cummings, director of advancement, joined AIDS Services 
Foundation of Orange County. (Prohaska has been replaced with Kimberly Ann 
Chafin, a CPA; the museum is looking for a development director.) 
</P>
<P>
 Announced last year, Newport Harbor's plan of reconfiguring and moving into 
the vacated library building next door, to expand usable floor space in the 
existing museum, remains just that: a plan. There is no target date for the 
project, estimated to cost $6 million to $7 million, including a $3-million 
endowment. About $1 million has been raised, all from museum board members. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The big show at the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art in Santa Ana this year was 
"Ancient Nubia: Egypt's Rival in Africa," imported from the University of 
Pennsylvania. As a scholarly investigation into a little-known ancient culture, 
it offered a much-needed boost to the Bowers' credibility as an educational 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the show was quite dry, giving little sense of the ancient 
Nubians as people. But at least it somewhat redeemed the unfortunate decision 
to mount "Seven Decades: Modern Mexican Art from the Bernard Lewin Collection," 
an exhibition driven more by an art dealer's interest in exhibiting the 
contents of his shop than by a museum's concerted attempt to analyze a field of 
modern art little known outside its homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even the visually appealing "Buddhist Images in Gilt Metal from the Chang 
Foundation" was marred by the Bowers' habit of showcasing objects as ineffable 
treasures, rather than as items made and valued in different ways by their own 
cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the best move the Bowers made all year was to open the Kidseum earlier 
this month. The new adjunct, in a formerly vacant nearby bank building on Main 
Street, offers interactive exhibitions for grade schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing last year's money-saving trend, exhibitions at the museums have 
been edging past the two-month mark, and a few seemed to go on forever. ("Lit 
From Within," the Amish quilt show at the Laguna, has settled in for 17 weeks; 
"Contemporary Crafts From the Saxe Collection" was up for 16 weeks at Newport 
Harbor; "Buddhist Images in Gilt Metal" lingered 15 weeks at the Bowers.) 
</P>
<P>
 Longer shows mean fewer opportunities for viewers to be exposed to different 
points of view, curatorial and artistic alike. That space for the permanent 
collection is at a premium in all three museums limits viewers' options all the 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another troubling point: This year, most of the best exhibitions were curated 
elsewhere. While intriguing projects from other institutions always are welcome 
(after all, few of us have the time or money to jet around the country in 
search of good shows), it is equally important for a museum staff to put its 
intelligence and creativity to work developing projects of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this problem due entirely to recessionary budget juggling? If so, how does 
one account for the Guggenheim Gallery at Chapman University, directed by 
Richard Turner? If there were an award this year for "the little institution 
that could," it would go to the Guggenheim for the consistent level of 
intelligence, innovation and thematic daring demonstrated by its exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Other continuing bright spots include: 
</P>
<P>
 * The UC Irvine Fine Arts Gallery, an oasis of social responsibility, which 
held the best faculty art show in memory this year and opened its walls to a 
moving group of AIDS-related works by largely anonymous community artists 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 * The energy and taste -- especially in painting -- of the Griffin Gallery in 
Costa Mesa, new on the scene this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Orange Coast College Art Gallery, cash-poor but ingenuity-rich, where 
visually effective installations are the rule. 
</P>
<P>
 * And the Fullerton Museum Center, home of shows with a warm (but never 
smarmy) community appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One more thought: As artists have discovered in Los Angeles and elsewhere, in 
bad times you have to come up with untraditional solutions for getting your 
work out. So far, little of this activity has come to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Showing in coffeehouses or restaurants seems to suit some people, but it isn't 
the only answer. Maybe artists will start holding open meetings to brainstorm 
ideas for alternative spaces and events. 
</P>
<P>
 It is time to clearly formulate curatorial ideas rather than just to display 
objects, to set off sparks by unexpected cross-cultural juxtapositions (the 
secret of so many contemporary Los Angeles artists' appeal), and to combine 
social beliefs and global consciousness with an eye for purely visual 
qualities. Happily, next year's lineup (see next week's column for details) 
suggests that some of these priorities are beginning to be met. Best Home-Grown 
Exhibitions 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the locally curated shows that most fully met the challenges of 
their own programs were modest affairs, small in scope or theme, or focused on 
the local scene:  
</P>
<P>
 * "Tony DeLap -- The House of the Magician: An Installation of Reconstructed 
Works, 1967-1975" in the Main Art Gallery, Cal State Fullerton (Feb. 5-March 
13): a respectful survey of large-scale, three-dimensional work and sprightly, 
lesser-known prints by the celebrated artist from Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Tim Hawkinson" at the Guggenheim Gallery, Chapman University (March 
21-April 29): stunningly inventive work by a leading light of the Los Angeles 
art scene. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Faculty/Staff: New Work" at the UC Irvine Fine Arts Gallery (April 5-30): 
An unusually inclusive approach yielded stimulating work by Young Soon Min, 
Steve Criqui, Jacci den Hartog, Judie Mamber, Renee Petropoulos and Mara Lonner 
and made this show a standout. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Kate T. Steinitz: Art Into Life Into Art" at the Severin Wunderman Museum 
(Aug. 1-Oct. 28): a low-key tribute to a gentle wit, who moved in some exalted 
art circles and made small-scale work offering observations of the passing 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Lunah Menoh's Boutique Mystique" at the Laguna Art Museum's satellite 
gallery in the South Coast Plaza mall (Sept. 2-Dec. 5): The artist's sculptural 
couture flirts with the tradition of shock-apparel in beguiling ways, with 
unexpected cultural juxtapositions. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Urban Artists and the Natural World" at the Guggenheim Gallery, Chapman 
University (Sept. 6-Oct. 7): A congenial group of 17 lesser-known East and West 
Coast artists approached the theme with wit and fresh visual solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Gotta Have It" at the Fullerton Museum Center (through Feb. 19): a 
wide-ranging, up-close-and-personal view of the stuff some people amass and why 
they bother to seek it out. Best Exhibitions

</P>
<P>
 * "Partial Recall: Photographs of Native North Americans" at the UC Irvine 
Fine Arts Gallery (Jan. 11-Feb. 12), organized by the Tyler Galleries of the 
Tyler School of Art, Philadelphia: striking examples of how photography can 
alter and hide the real history of a minority group. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Augustus Vincent Tack: Landscape of the Spirit" at the Laguna Art Museum 
(Feb. 25-May 8), from the Phillips Collection, Washington, D.C.: thorough 
documentation of the life and work of an early 20th-Century idealist whose 
near-abstractions were a means of expressing religious belief. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Erika Rothenberg: House of Cards" at the Laguna Art Museum's satellite 
gallery in the South Coast Plaza mall (April 1-July 10), organized by the 
Museum of Modern Art, New York: briskly satirical "greeting cards" that say 
what we often really mean when we send Hallmark's very best. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Commodity Image: Photography, Sculpture, Installation" at the Laguna Art 
Museum (May 13-July 24), organized by the International Center for Photography, 
New York: a sharp and spicy look at the ways advertising values have co-opted 
the way we view the world. 
</P>
<P>
 * "August Gay" at the Laguna Art Museum (May 13-July 24), organized by the 
Monterey Peninsula Museum of Art: The kind of solidly researched, decidedly 
non-blockbuster show we don't see often enough, about an appealing, 
little-known regional artist. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Celebrating the Life Cycle: Rites of Passage in America" at the Fullerton 
Museum Center (June 24-Aug. 14), organized by the Balch Institute for 
Ethnographic Studies in Philadelphia: a simple show with a big heart and an 
acute awareness of the evolving, cross-cultural ways in which certain Americans 
mark big moments in their lives. Most Effective Public Art

</P>
<P>
 On July 25, artists Mark Chamberlain and Jerry Burchfield spent the entire day 
lying in two flower-strewn "graves" alongside Laguna Canyon Road, at the site 
of the proposed San Joaquin Hills Toll Road, attended by silent, unmoving, 
black-clad mourners. In "Vigil at the Crossroads," the atmosphere of utter 
desolation -- a grim tableau like the dark alter ego of the Pageant of the 
Masters show -- served as an eloquent last-minute appeal on behalf of the 
natural world. Least Effective Public

 Artist Greg Gibbs impersonated Rory Devine, founder of the TRI gallery in Los 
Angeles, at a Rancho Santiago College "Art Forum" talk on March 21. Although it

NEWS ANALYSIS; HIJACKING ONLY CONFIRMS U.S. FEARS ON ALGERIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN WRIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even before the Christmas Eve jet hijacking in Algiers, Clinton Administration 
officials had identified the rapidly escalating conflict between Algeria's 
military-backed regime and its Islamic opposition as the most serious "new" 
foreign policy crisis likely to grab world headlines in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Algeria's regime took power after a January, 1992, military coup voided 
elections that seemed certain to lead to an Islamic government. The 
Administration has tried, without success, to persuade its Western allies -- 
particularly France, Algeria's former colonial power -- to quit propping up the 
military-backed regime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Algerian junta set off alarm bells in Washington in October when it 
decided to abandon attempts at reconciliation in favor of an all-out campaign 
to eradicate the growing Islamic opposition. The shift marked a critical 
turning point, U.S. officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our view is that the Algerian regime cannot win," said a senior U.S. 
specialist on Algeria. "Eradication and repression won't work. The past three 
years show that this kind of strategy not only doesn't work, it instead further 
radicalizes the opposition. This will only bring about exactly the opposite 
result." 
</P>
<P>
 As if on cue, Muslim extremists hijacked the Air France jet Saturday, and it 
was flown to the French Mediterranean port of Marseilles early Monday. The 
hijackers had killed three passengers during the initial standoff in Algiers. 
French police stormed the plane at dusk Monday in a firefight that left all 
four terrorists dead and 25 injured among the passengers, crew and police. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 24 hours before the hijacking, the State Department had warned Americans 
to get out or stay out of the North African country if they lacked effective 
means of protecting themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Continuing attacks against foreigners indicate that the level of risk in 
Algeria has increased," the State Department said. "There is a heightened risk 
of danger to persons traveling overland without adequate security 
arrangements." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the hijacking, more than 70 foreigners, including two dozen French 
citizens, had been killed since Muslim extremists demanded in late 1993 that 
all foreigners leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
 And as for the Algerian toll, the government admitted this fall that it had 
reached 10,000 killed. American sources estimate the total at more than 20,000 
and rising fast. 
</P>
<P>
 The military-installed government of President Liamine Zeroual has begun using 
"totally ruthless tactics, whatever it takes" to eliminate the Islamic 
Salvation Front, the front-runner in the aborted 1992 elections, and the more 
militant Armed Islamic Group, another Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence is growing of indiscriminate executions during military 
counterinsurgency operations, U.S. officials say. Elite government commandos, 
long tied to the deaths of many Islamists and civilians, are also more active. 
Torture and detention without trial are also rampant, according to U.S. 
officials and human rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
 As in previous, more limited counterinsurgency campaigns, the latest crackdown 
may lead to short-term government gains. But in the long term, U.S. analysts 
say, the junta may actually become more vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time the regime has cracked down, the situation has calmed down for a 
few months," the U.S. official said. "But it hasn't marked a victory. All the 
Islamic opposition is really doing is laying low. After the offensive is over, 
they come back even stronger than they had been with a counteroffensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the hijacking, Islamic guerrillas are able to carry out frequent 
operations against military targets, including barracks, with impunity, U.S. 
officials say. As a result, the area outside government control is steadily 
growing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the government holds Algiers, it is challenged even there. Most 
security forces do not venture beyond downtown because the Islamists control 
many of the capital's neighborhoods, officials add. 
</P>
<P>
 In the provinces, the government rules only nominally. After dark, troops 
retreat into the safety of barracks and the Islamists take control, leading to 
public distinctions between the "government of the day" and the "government of 
the night." 
</P>
<P>
 More ominous, the Armed Islamic Group, some of whose forces fought alongside 
Afghan guerrillas against Soviet troops, has increased grisly attacks on 
Algerian civilians, intellectuals and journalists, in contrast to the 
predominantly military targets of other Islamic guerrillas. The hijackers of 
the Air France jetliner were members of the Armed Islamic Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeroual has pledged presidential elections in 1995, although U.S. officials do 
not consider them likely. That promise "comes amid other indications of the 
growing influence of hard-liners in the military leadership who reject 
compromise with the opposition," Robert H. Pelletreau Jr., assistant secretary 
of state for Near East affairs, said in a speech last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Many U.S. officials and scholars expect that the "eradicators" in the military 
will sabotage any genuine effort at reconciliation by Zeroual, who is among 
those believed to favor a political accommodation. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials deny French suspicions that Washington is preparing for a 
future Islamic regime. "The best hope for a solution which will guarantee 
Algeria's internal peace and prospects, as well as its contribution to 
long-term regional stability, lies not in a strategy of repression but one of 
inclusion and reconciliation,' Pelletreau said. 
</P>
<P>
 Specialists in the Administration now differ on the timing of a climax to the 
three-year civil war between the regime and Islamic guerrillas. Some believe a 
denouement is likely next year, in part because Algerian society can't or won't 
tolerate the soaring number of deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Others predict a prolonged period of conflict and chaos, as in Afghanistan, 
stretching two or three years or longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials say even the best case is not good enough, a key 
reason for Administration activism. After the 1992 coup, the George Bush 
Administration reacted only with a statement "regretting" the suspension of 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Western allies, the crisis in Africa's third-largest country has long 
been a leading issue in Europe, particularly France. Several governments fear a 
mass migration across the Mediterranean if an Islamic government is installed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first two years of the crisis, France and other Mediterranean countries 
helped the junta that overthrew reformist President Chadli Bendjedid when the 
Islamic front was poised to win Algeria's first democratic parliamentary 
elections. And since 1992, the Mediterranean nations have provided financial 
aid, technical expertise and military equipment while encouraging business 
links. 
</P>
<P>
 But the leadership role has gradually shifted. "A number of European 
governments have begun to feel uncomfortable about the explicit French position 
-- specifically assisting the regime and pushing it toward a harder-line 
approach," the Administration source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain is the only European country that has moved significantly toward the 
U.S. position, although plans for a gas pipeline from Algeria to Spain are 
proceeding. Britain and Italy are inching closer, U.S. officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is working to unify positions to prevent the kind of 
Western dissension that has been so destructive in Bosnia-Herzegovina. "There 
are no good solutions here, only bad ones," the U.S. official said. "What we're 
trying to do is avoid the worst one."

O.C. PRO SPORTS TEAMS PLAY AN IRKSOME WAITING GAME; NEGOTIATIONS: TURMOIL 
SURROUNDING BASEBALL AND HOCKEY MAY FADE INTO MEMORY -- ALONG WITH THE RAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Not so long ago, the worst thing that could happen to professional sports in 
Orange County was to have a losing team -- and goodness knows there have been 
plenty of those. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1994, instead of simply watching a team lose, Ram fans worried about 
losing a team.  
</P>
<P>
 And what's worse than reading about the Angels being mired at the bottom of 
the American League West, or the Mighty Ducks struggling just to score a goal? 
Reading about antitrust exemptions and 122% salary-tax rates after labor 
disputes shut down seasons, that's what. 
</P>
<P>
 Face it, the year in sports was so bad that visits by the lowly Los Angeles 
Clippers basketball team were good news. 
</P>
<P>
 And 1995? The face of sports in Orange County might be almost unrecognizable 
(Who are those guys in the Angels' uniforms?) or it could return to the 
familiar -- though expecting the Rams to stay and baseball and hockey to return 
to status quo is no longer very realistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Pro sports in Orange County are in a period of "unbelievable turmoil," said 
Tony Tavares, president of Disney Sports Enterprises, which owns the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the Rams stay or go? Will the Mighty Ducks play -- or no? And will the 
real Angels take the field in April, or will a bunch of has-been and never-were 
replacement players be wearing their uniforms? 
</P>
<P>
 "Some major decisions have to be made within a 90-day period that could 
determine the entire outlook for pro sports in Orange County in the next 
decade," said John Nicoletti, spokesman for The Pond. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Anaheim has been hit with a triple-whammy -- one team trying to 
move and two mired in the worst labor disputes in the history of sports. Mayor 
Tom Daly says he remains "bullish" on Anaheim's future as a home for pro 
sports. But Richard Brown, president of the Angels, looks at the scene and sees 
"the worst nightmare" for city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to be looking at each other thinking, 'Is this as bad as it gets or 
does it get worse?' " 
</P>
<P>
 As the new year approaches, one of the quicker resolutions could come in 
hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 A last-minute settlement in the National Hockey League labor dispute could put 
the Ducks back on The Pond within weeks. If so, count on the remarkably 
undemanding Duck fans -- and the wizardry of rookie Paul Kariya -- to fill all 
17,174 seats with regularity. 
</P>
<P>
 But, if the bullheadedness doesn't end soon, the NHL will become the first 
major North American pro sports league to cancel an entire season because of 
labor problems. If that happens, in the words of one partisan, Duck Coach Ron 
Wilson: "We're looking at a nuclear winter." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney, which made a remarkable $9-million profit on the Ducks in their 
start-up year, would probably lose about $6 million on the team if there is no 
hockey this season -- a $15-million swing. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Tavares says "we are committed to this marketplace," and he is 
convinced Duck fans (and T-shirt customers) will come back with enthusiasm 
whenever hockey returns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're Americans, and Americans by nature are worried about today, 
what's going on at the moment," Tavares said. "They have very little regard for 
negotiations and renegotiations. We're going through problems, and people are 
angry. I'm not trying to diminish what they feel, but to me it's short-term 
anger. I think the baseball fans have short-term anger too. Two years from now, 
people won't remember all this -- until we get another fiasco." 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball entered the most uncertain period in its history last Thursday when 
owners unilaterally implemented a salary cap. Now the game moves from the field 
to the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 If there's no settlement nor court injunctions, Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann 
could be hitting fungoes to a bunch of strangers when spring training opens in 
February at Tempe Diablo Stadium in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 One odd twist is the theory that replacement players might actually make the 
Angels more competitive instead of 90-game losers. 
</P>
<P>
 Think of it, the Chicago White Sox without Frank Thomas, the Toronto Blue Jays 
without Joe Carter. That levels the playing field for the budget-oriented 
Angels, who might have another edge at plucking strike-breakers because of 
their location in the baseball belt. The assorted alumni of Cal State Fullerton 
and various community colleges sprinkled with a few retired professional 
players wouldn't make the worst team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what we'll be playing with, it's too early to speculate," said 
Brown, the team president. "We're in a situation unlike any other I've ever 
been in. We can't do a whole lot of preparation. The most logical thing you can 
do is prepare as if it will be a normal season." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels might not be hurt at the gate as much as some people imagine. For 
one thing, attendance was already low last season, an average of 24,010 a game. 
An Associated Press survey recently found that 51% of fans would attend the 
same number of games even if baseball fields teams with replacement players. In 
Anaheim, where a sizable chunk of the summertime crowd is made up of tourists, 
the figure might be higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Bleak as it all seems, the Angels' long-term future is actually brightening. 
Negotiations between the Angels and the city of Anaheim to build a 
baseball-only stadium by the 1998 season are ongoing -- though the county's 
budget crisis has put the talks on what is so far being described as a 
temporary hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, once the labor dispute is resolved, the Angels might be more 
willing to compete financially. For one thing, all 28 teams will be operating 
with a new set of rules. But more important, the introduction of a minority 
owner -- former baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth is among the contenders 
-- will mean a new direction and an infusion of cash. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Rams, even if they announce shortly that they are signing a deal to 
move to St. Louis, the suspense won't be over. Any agreement will be contingent 
on several provisions -- almost like a buyer's offer on a home depends on 
financing or the results of an inspection. Ram fans and the city of Anaheim 
will probably remain in limbo for months as they await the outcome of potential 
lawsuits or other legal wrangling. Plus, the move would have to receive 
approval from the NFL's other owners in March -- and that's no cinch. 
</P>
<P>
 If Orange County does end up without an NFL team, it's not likely to be 
without pro football for long -- unfortunately for NFL fans, it might be in the 
form of the Canadian Football League or arena football. 
</P>
<P>
 But before then there might be all sorts of maneuvers. L.A. Raiders owner Al 
Davis, known for his attempts to play cities against each other, won't be 
quiet, rest assured, once he has the only NFL team in the nation's 
second-largest television market. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's not beyond the imagination that Walt Disney Co. -- which has never 
hidden its desire to expand its involvement in pro sports and has tested the 
waters at the NFL by making inquiries -- might take advantage of the situation 
and undercut Davis by showing interest in owning an NFL expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
 It might not matter that the NFL has no expansion plans and has rules against 
corporate ownership. Having some leverage against Davis would delight the NFL 
-- and as Disney showed when it swept in and brought the Mighty Ducks to Orange 
County in a quiet deal that slipped underneath almost everyone's radar, the 
entertainment giant's dollars and marketing muscle are capable of grabbing a 
sports league's attention. So the current stadium's not good enough? That $203 
million Disney Chairman Michael Eisner made one year would build one. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the chances that Disney embarks on another major sports venture in 
Anaheim in the next five years, Tavares says only, "I think those are 
relatively high . . . if the right opportunity presents itself. Timing is 
everything in life." 
</P>
<P>
 While two of pro sports' major leagues are in disarray as owners and players 
wrestle over economic control, a quieter revolution has taken place in the 
minor leagues and lesser-known sports. Roller hockey and indoor soccer might be 
derived from more traditional games, but they find their audience -- and it's 
an audience of families who have been driven away from the big leagues by high 
ticket prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash, an indoor soccer franchise whose most expensive ticket next season 
will be $12, averaged close to 5,000 fans at The Pond this summer during its 
first season. By the last five games of its 20-8 season, the team was drawing 
more than 7,000 a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a family of four to come to a live, professional sporting event for as 
little as $16, I don't see how we can go wrong next year," said Tim Ryan, 
general manager of the team, owned by Ogden Facility Management, which operates 
The Pond. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa, an outdoor soccer team that plays at Titan Stadium in Fullerton, 
also has a top ticket price of $12 and drew an average of 3,572. For an Oct. 2 
American Professional Soccer League semifinal game against Montreal, 5,623 
filed into the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim Bullfrogs, a Roller Hockey International team that plays in The 
Pond, lost in the league semifinals this season after winning the championship 
in their first year. They also led the league in attendance with an average of 
9,885. 
</P>
<P>
 With success stories like that, indoor lacrosse could be The Pond's next 
tenant. 
</P>
<P>
 About the only "small-time" pro teams in Orange County that aren't thriving 
are the Newport Beach Dukes, a TeamTennis franchise whose future is uncertain 
after drawing crowds of fewer than 1,000, and a poorly publicized women's 
indoor pro volleyball team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people are always looking for something new and fun, especially in 
Southern California, and if you can offer exciting sports -- and probably most 
importantly, entertainment value for the dollar -- I think the fans will 
support your franchise," said Nicoletti, who is spokesman for the Splash as 
well as The Pond. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been personally saying for years that the face of sports in Southern 
California might be changing. Watching the franchises in the L.A. area, the 
facilities where they play and the ownership of the teams in the last five 
years has been, you know . . . interesting. "

UNION WANTS FORMAL MEETING WITH COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE and JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In its second emergency meeting over the holiday weekend, Orange County's 
largest employees union voted Monday to ask the county for a formal meeting to 
discuss reinstating its labor contracts, and to appeal to department managers 
individually to use layoffs only as a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 Still reeling from Thursday's announcement that the county would immediately 
reduce its budget by $40.2 million and might lay off hundreds of workers, the 
leadership of the Orange County Employees Assn. decided on Christmas Day to 
authorize legal action against the county. Though the 19-member board met again 
Monday, it still had not decided whether a lawsuit or administrative appeals 
would work best. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a profound sense of betrayal here," said John Sawyer Jr., an 
attorney for the union, which represents 16 collective bargaining units. "The 
county has resorted to deception where candor used to characterize the 
relationship the county had with its employees." 
</P>
<P>
 John H. Sawyer, general manager of the union, which represents 11,000 of the 
county's 18,000 workers, said a decision on legal action would likely come next 
week. Union leaders are angry that the County Board of Supervisors on Thursday 
suspended collective bargaining agreements and gave county managers broad 
discretion over whom it can fire, regardless of a worker's seniority. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the union will seek "meet-and-confer" sessions with the county's 
human resources department as early as Wednesday in hopes of renewing the 
collective bargaining agreements that the Board of Supervisors voided as part 
of its budget-slashing plan, officials said. Supervisors said the bankruptcy 
filing gave them the authority to set aside the labor contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the worst thing we've ever faced in this county," said Sawyer Sr. (who 
is the father of the union's lawyer). Employees "had absolutely nothing to do 
with causing this bankruptcy, we don't want to see them come to any harm," said 
Sawyer, adding that county officials should have met with the union to discuss 
alternatives to widespread layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county is kind of picking the pockets of county employees to come up with 
some money to reduce their losses," he said. "It's petty cash, really, compared 
to the size of the investment loss. But it's a lot of money to the individual 
employees." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner said the county was under extraordinary pressure 
to reduce spending immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was an urgency," he said. "We spend $7 million a week in salaries. By 
the time we had the process for meeting and conferring, talking about those who 
had seniority and who might be laid off, the whole thing could have lasted 
until May." 
</P>
<P>
 Union representatives will also seek meetings with every department manager in 
the next two weeks to suggest job sharing, early retirement and leaves of 
absence as options. Department heads were told Thursday how much they needed to 
cut, but have until Jan. 10 to decide how to meet the goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the county to prove to us the necessity of layoffs," Sawyer Sr. said 
Monday. "They've blithely come along and said, 'We have to lay off people.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But the union general manager said employees cannot support an 
across-the-board pay cut, as some labor leaders have suggested. "There's 
nothing in our agreements that calls for reducing salaries," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The union's board is scheduled to meet tonight at 6 with representatives of 
each of its 16 bargaining units. The union has also scheduled membership 
meetings at its headquarters Jan. 4, at lunchtime and in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Union representatives say they were never given warning that the county 
intended to slash millions from the budget this year and suspend the labor 
contracts, even the night before the Board of Supervisors approved the action. 
</P>
<P>
 As late as Wednesday night, the management council of Sheriff Brad Gates, 
Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi and Health Care Agency Director Tom Uram had 
assured labor officials that despite the financial crisis, "They were not going 
to make cuts on the backs of the employees or take from the pockets of the 
employees, because it was not the employees' fault," Sawyer Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sawyer Jr. said that at the Wednesday night meeting with the management 
council, they wanted to put to rest two rumors: that the layoff of 800 
employees was imminent and that the contracts would be set aside. They were 
told that neither would come to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't know what kind of good faith was there at that meeting," Sawyer 
Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
 In view of the fiscal calamity, union officials were expecting to be called 
into meetings and advised about county options for making cutbacks. Labor 
leaders say they probably could have created a plan that included no layoffs by 
working out a way to cut full-time jobs back to part-time work, offer leaves of 
absences, have employees share jobs, figure out who was eligible for early 
retirement and other options. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have come up with $40 million without laying anyone off or reducing 
any public services," Sawyer Sr. said. "Why did the county have to alarm the 
public so needlessly?" 
</P>
<P>
 Both Sawyers say the county has never done a good job of explaining how an 
estimated $2.02-billion loss in Orange County's investment fund -- which 
contains the savings of 187 school districts, cities and other public entities 
-- translates into the need for $40 million in savings in the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials have said that nearly $30 million of that amount will come 
from slicing budgets in dozens of departments. The other $10 million will come 
from cash advances from federal, state and local sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Sawyer Jr. said the union has not decided precisely what legal avenue it wants 
to pursue but believes the county misapplied a law allowing a company in 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy to unilaterally abandon a collective bargaining agreement 
if revisions can't be agreed upon. The county filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some legal experts believe the law is on the county's side because Congress in 
1984 prohibited employers from canceling labor contracts under Chapter 11 
bankruptcies but said nothing about Chapter 9 filings. 
</P>
<P>
 Sawyer, the union's attorney, disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't just blindly apply the law from one area to the other without the 
right parallels," he said. "There are fundamental differences here and it is 
not responsible to say the law in one realm applies to the other realm." 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors voted on the budget cuts and labor contract 
suspensions just one day before the county's 600 firefighters were due for a 3 
1/2% cost-of-living pay raise. Ironically, the firefighters voted earlier this 
year to forgo the raise this past July so they could receive three raises 
between now and next December. Had they agreed to the raise in July, they would 
have received only one more next year in June, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Monday, the man who has launched the only recall effort against an 
Orange County supervisor in the wake of the bankruptcy crisis spoke out, saying 
he waited weeks for others to take action and when nobody stepped forward, did 
so himself because he believes the supervisors have threatened the future of 
schools countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 Felix Rocha Jr., 49, a board member of the Orange County Department of 
Education, says that in the wake of serving recall papers against Roger R. 
Stanton, he has received several calls from elected officials who cautioned 
against taking on Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Rocha, who works for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization's 
organized crime unit, said, "The county has suffered a major, major loss. 
Somebody had to do something." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Rocha set the recall process in motion when he filed a notice of 
intent to recall Stanton, the supervisor who represents the 1st District area 
of central Orange County where Rocha lives. But Rocha did not include a section 
of the California Election Code that advises the target of a recall that he or 
she has seven days to file a response to the notice with the registrar's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he will return to Stanton's office today to serve those papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocha, however, might be in for a little criticism of his own. The Orange 
County Department of Education was one of four school districts that last year 
borrowed $200 million for placement into the county's controversial investment 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocha said he is not sure that he approved such a move, but if he did, "I'll 
take whatever heat there is. Maybe I should have paid attention. Maybe I should 
be critical of myself."

SEEDS FOR BRULTE'S RISE WERE PLANTED ALONG THE POTOMAC; POLITICS: GOP LEADER 
HONED SKILLS IN LOW-LEVEL POSTS. NOW, HE TRIES TO PARLAY THAT INTO ASSEMBLY 
SPEAKERSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE and PAUL JACOBS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the 1980s, Jim Brulte was the quintessential Washington advance man, always 
working behind the scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 As a logistics specialist for then-Vice President George Bush, Brulte helped 
put together an Oregon river-rafting trip and a Dodger Stadium stopover. On an 
official visit to Bahrain, where it seldom rains, he was the one who found 
umbrellas when a storm threatened to douse the Bush entourage. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in the fraternity of the advance team that Brulte honed his political 
skills, cultivated a nationwide network of contacts and developed his ambitions 
for political office. 
</P>
<P>
 As state Assembly Republican leader, he now finds himself at center stage, 
seeking to topple legendary Speaker Willie Brown, the San Francisco Democrat 
who has held onto the gavel for 14 years. With Brulte and Brown deadlocked at 
40 votes apiece, the Assembly will reconvene Jan. 4 to resume the fight for 
what has been the second most powerful job in state government. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to be Speaker of the Assembly," Brulte said in an interview. "It's 
just a matter of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte would be the first Southern Californian in 20 years -- and the first 
Republican since 1970 -- to hold the speakership. 
</P>
<P>
 A Gargantuan figure at 6 feet 4 and 349 pounds, he has a gift for storytelling 
and a self-deprecating sense of humor, but he is a private person who is 
uncomfortable in the spotlight and whose political opponents accuse him of 
having a calculating side. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many politicians at his level, the 38-year-old Brulte did not ascend to 
statewide prominence through a succession of election victories and powerful 
committee assignments. Although he does not have a long list of legislative 
accomplishments, there is a record here. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he arrived in the Capitol four years ago, Brulte's chief claim to fame 
was that he had secured a series of low-level political appointments in 
Washington. Around his Ontario hometown, one old acquaintance recalls friends 
joking that Brulte was going through a job a week. 
</P>
<P>
 His critics say he has selectively traded on his ties to the Ronald Reagan and 
Bush administrations while campaigning. They contend that he dropped from his 
resume a potentially embarrassing eight months when he was assigned to the 
scandal-plagued Department of Housing and Urban Development, though there is no 
evidence he was caught up in the mess. It appears that he embellished a stint 
at the Pentagon, saying he worked for an assistant defense secretary, who today 
cannot recall him. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, the politician has been faulted for helping to approve a large 
pay boost for his girlfriend, Kelli Norton, while she was on the public payroll 
of the Assembly Republicans. Brulte's action was cited by Assemblyman Paul 
Horcher of Diamond Bar as one of his reasons for defecting from the Republicans 
and helping deny Brulte the speakership. 
</P>
<P>
 As GOP leader, Brulte acknowledges missteps but says he also deserves credit 
for improving Republican fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've done a great job here. I've screwed up some. Maybe I shouldn't 
have dated Kelli," Brulte said. "But I think you have to look real hard to find 
any mistakes that I've made as leader and I never wanted to be Speaker." 
</P>
<P>
 Even without the title, Brulte has attracted an enthusiastic following among 
Republicans for having thwarted Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of his Falstaffian appearance some people have under-estimated Brulte 
throughout his career and they have done so at their own risk," said David 
Beckwith, onetime press secretary for former Vice President Dan Quayle who has 
known Brulte since the 1988 raft trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Admirers praise Brulte as a straight-talking, shirt-sleeve style politician 
who knows how to tap into his contacts to get things done, whether it is 
persuading Quayle to make a campaign stop or capturing state funds to reduce 
traffic for his Inland Empire constituents. They characterize him as a 
resourceful and tireless conservative who has utilized his advance man's skills 
to organize Republican election triumphs across California. He is known to pick 
up the phone and call associates at all hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte still finds time to slip off to movies. Having attended a private 
religious school as a boy, Brulte is deeply religious, tithing 10% of his 
salary to his church, the Community Baptist Church of Rancho Cucamonga. He is a 
teetotaler, he says, because he has seen the harm that alcohol can do. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Glen Cove, N.Y., Brulte moved in 1960 to Ontario, where he and his 
two brothers were raised. His father was an aerospace worker. His mother later 
became a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte paints a picture of an almost idyllic childhood living on a cul-de-sac 
in a suburban neighborhood, playing ball, going to California Angels games, 
joining the water polo team and serving as student body president at Chaffey 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
 As a boy, Brulte helped his father paint the local Republican headquarters and 
pasted up stickers for Reagan's 1966 gubernatorial campaign. Recalling his 
father, who died in 1985, Brulte fondly describes himself as "my father's son." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to tell you that I had a really rebellious period in my life," 
Brulte said. "But I never really did." 
</P>
<P>
 The family home, where his mother lives, remains a magnet. "My mom's house is 
still the center of our universe," he said, "because you can go back there and 
these are the people that knew you when you were a snotty-nosed little dirty 
kid." 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from high school, Brulte joined the California Air National 
Guard and in less than two years was named the nation's air guardsman of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of a local GOP activist, Brulte obtained an unpaid internship 
from then-Sen. S.I. Hayakawa (R-Calif.) while he was attending Azusa Pacific 
College. After Brulte's graduation from Cal Poly Pomona in 1980, Hayakawa gave 
him a job, which included driving the senator's mobile office around the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte had such a strong case of Potomac fever that he took the only job that 
Hayakawa had for him in Washington. He laughs now in recalling that he was the 
only male receptionist in the Senate at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the job served as a launching pad for his career. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1983, Brulte was tabbed as executive director of the Republican Hispanic 
Assembly, a group set up to energize Latino voters. Tirso del Junco, the 
assembly's chairman, said Brulte's selection was not a unanimous choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody didn't want Jim Brulte because he could not speak any Spanish, but 
I felt this guy was very well qualified," said Del Junco, former state 
Republican chairman. "He knew his way around Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1985, Brulte became an assistant to the assistant secretary of 
defense for reserve affairs, James Webb -- a job he also listed proudly in 
campaign brochures. 
</P>
<P>
 But Webb says he has no recollection of Brulte. "He did not work directly 
under me," Webb said in an interview. "Not out of my office. . . . He was not a 
political appointee on my staff, I can say that." 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte now acknowledges that he "did not interact with Webb" and was assigned 
to an office outside the Pentagon, where he worked on special projects and 
began to do advance work for Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 He explained that Bush and Reagan "relied on people in agencies" as well as 
individuals from corporate America to buttress the White House staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is how presidents, whether you are Republican or Democrat, you cook the 
book," he said. "You always reduce the number of White House staff . . . then 
you just detail people from agencies." 
</P>
<P>
 After six months, Brulte got a post at the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, helping to prepare the way for a new HUD secretary. Brulte said 
his political patron, Del Junco, was considered a prime candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 During his eight months at HUD, Brulte escaped any involvement in an 
influence-peddling scandal that broke into public view in 1989 when he was 
preparing to run for the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After his father's death in 1985, Brulte decided he needed to be closer to his 
mother and returned to California the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 He contacted a longtime friend and booster, June Wallin, who was chairing the 
San Bernardino County Republican Central Committee, and persuaded her to hire 
him part time as the local party's first executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Using his contacts, Brulte arranged for Barbara Bush to fly out for a county 
GOP fund-raiser, which helped pay his salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Wallin has mixed feelings about Brulte, praising his efforts to build 
up the party but faulting him for showing bald ambition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim, when he first started out (at the Republican committee), I would put my 
trust in him whatever he wanted to do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two had a falling out. Later, Wallin said, Brulte recruited a new 
party chairman to replace her at the end of her term, one who would be more to 
his liking. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he juggled his party responsibilities with duties as an aide to 
Assemblyman Charles W. Bader and positioned himself to succeed the Pomona 
Republican, who was preparing to challenge popular Sen. Ruben S. Ayala 
(D-Chino) in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in Washington and I knew a lot of members of Congress," Brulte 
said, "(I realized) those people aren't any brighter than I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte proudly recalled the strategy he devised to dissuade others from 
running for Bader's seat. With the race more than a year away, he set out to 
raise so much money that he would appear invincible and scare off Republican 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 He was particularly worried about Chino Mayor Fred Aguiar, a Democrat who 
switched parties in the heavily Republican district. "It was going to be a 
war," Brulte recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Sending out targeted fund-raising letters to community leaders and 
opinion-makers, he tried to create the impression that he was sending mailers 
to everyone in the area. Brulte says his strategy worked, but Aguiar, who now 
represents a neighboring Assembly district, says he pulled out of the campaign 
before the primary for personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that much of the money for Brulte's first campaign came from 
developers and real estate interests. 
</P>
<P>
 With that financial advantage, he easily defeated his remaining Republican 
opponent, Pomona Councilman Mark Nymeyer. And he beat an underfunded Democratic 
county probation counselor, Bob Erwin, in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
 During the campaign, Erwin tried without success to make an issue of Brulte's 
working at HUD and dropping mention of it from his campaign brochures. "By 
rewriting his resume to suit his own convenience, it showed a lack of ethics," 
Erwin said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 To this day, Brulte lists his Department of Defense post on his official 
biography, but not his time at HUD. When asked if the deletion was intentional, 
Brulte replied: "I don't know. I mean, my resume doesn't tell a lot of things." 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte won reelection in 1992 and again in November when he overwhelmed 
Democrat Richard Edwards, a teacher and salesman, who raised less than $5,000 
for the campaign. Brulte raised more than $1 million in 1994, passing out most 
of it to other Republican candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 His campaign war chest relies heavily on developers. Lewis Homes, a major 
developer, in 1992 gave Brulte $4,500 of free campaign office space, records 
show. Forecast Mortgage, another major development firm, chipped in use of a 
private jet worth $6,000 so Brulte could fly Gov. Pete Wilson to San Bernardino 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte's personal finances are more modest. Unlike Brown, who maintained a 
lucrative law practice throughout his political career, Brulte has not amassed 
substantial holdings. Records show he owes about $200,000 on his 
3,000-square-foot house in Rancho Cucamonga. He has also held onto a small 
condo in Arlington, Va., which he rents out. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, he borrowed $16,500 from his friend and fund-raiser Diane Stone -- 
using the condo as security -- as part of a package to refinance his Rancho 
Cucamonga home. For a time, he said, he found himself scraping by on his 
$57,750 annual salary as Republican leader as he struggled to repay Stone and 
keep up payments on his property. 
</P>
<P>
 As a legislator, Brulte has gained a reputation as a pragmatic conservative 
who is close to business interests. He played a role in negotiating a workers' 
compensation reform package signed into law last year. He authored a bill that 
would have established a pilot program to assist the homeless in San Bernardino 
County and some others, but it was vetoed. Another bill he advanced would have 
provided Cal Poly Pomona, his alma mater, with some horse racing revenues for 
equine research. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Brulte has been focused on the speakership, giving him little 
time to develop an agenda. His list of future priorities includes overhauling 
the welfare system, cutting taxes, cracking down on crime and making it tougher 
to file frivolous lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Republican lawmakers and aides say he has unified the often-fractious 
Assembly Republican Caucus, which has gone through a succession of leaders over 
the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte can also be quick to direct barbs at his own members. At a welcoming 
dinner for GOP nominees in June, he introduced a moderate who supports abortion 
rights, calling her "the baby killer from Newport Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some of Brulte's GOP supporters privately criticize his leadership, 
accusing him of relying too heavily on a small, close-knit group of advisers, 
especially when Brulte appeared to have the speakership within his grasp if he 
had won over some Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 While Brown describes Brulte as "the best I've seen on that side of the 
aisle," the longtime Speaker said Brulte's ambition has overwhelmed his more 
practical instincts. 
</P>
<P>
 "He really wanted and thought he would be Speaker," Brown said, "and that's 
not something I've seen in him before and it warped his judgment."

MTA CONTRACTORS DISPENSE THOUSANDS IN POLITICAL GIFTS; SUBWAY: A BAN HAS BEEN 
PROPOSED ON DONATIONS TO MEMBERS OF NEW OVERSIGHT PANEL, BUT IT HAS MET 
RESISTANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, where billions of dollars in 
contracts are parceled out, the influence of political contributions is an 
ever-present undercurrent. 
</P>
<P>
 Lobbyists -- more of them are registered at the MTA than at the state Capitol 
-- blanket the agency's meetings. And, records show, companies that do business 
with the MTA have donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to a handful of 
elected officials who oversee the nation's most expensive subway project. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as the MTA reorganizes to correct serious construction and management 
deficiencies, officials also are wrestling with whether to impose greater 
separation between the campaign contributions of contractors and the public 
policy decisions of transit board members who have received those 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 26, with little discussion, the board overwhelmingly rejected a 
proposal that would have barred them from accepting any contributions from MTA 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 They did unanimously pass a proposal that prohibits members of the board who 
will serve on the agency's new construction contract award committee from 
accepting campaign money from contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 That committee is replacing the MTA's recently dissolved Rail Construction 
Corp., which oversaw subway construction and awarded contracts, subject to MTA 
board approval. The RCC had been criticized for being too closely aligned with 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban on contributions was proposed to insulate members of the new 
construction oversight committee from contractors who give political gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to give us an opportunity to show that we're voting for the 
taxpayer, not the special interest," MTA board member James Cragin said after 
his reform measure passed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cragin's proposal is now meeting resistance. Other board members have 
referred it to the county counsel for further legal analysis, and Cragin fears 
the proposal will be "studied" and maneuvered to its death. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't want to tighten things up. . . . It's going to cut off their 
flow of money for elections," Cragin said. "They like it the way it was -- 
where it was real loose and you could play games." 
</P>
<P>
 The chairman of the MTA, county Supervisor Mike Antonovich, said he is 
withholding judgment regarding the fate of Cragin's proposal until the legal 
analysis is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre, an MTA board member who has 
objected to aspects of Cragin's proposal, said the public is adequately 
protected by existing laws requiring disclosure of campaign donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Alatorre also suggested that many MTA board members would rather continue to 
accept contributions from contractors than take a seat on the new construction 
committee. "What happens if we don't have people who want to serve on the 
committee?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last decade, a handful of elected officials who continue to serve on 
the MTA board have accepted more than $500,000 in campaign contributions from 
construction contractors, engineers, lawyers, lobbyists and other firms doing 
business on the Downtown subway project, records show. And those totals do not 
include the board's past members, such as former Mayor Tom Bradley, who alone 
collected more than $45,000 from Metro Rail contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Some contractors also have contributed to a favorite tax-exempt charity of 
Alatorre. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA board members oversee a panoply of decisions that affect the contractors. 
In addition to awarding contracts, the board members evaluate contractors' 
requests for extra payments and play a role in enforcing standards covering 
construction quality, minority hiring and safety. 
</P>
<P>
 What, if anything, can contractors expect when they contribute to the 
campaigns of MTA board members? 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question that people that are on your (contributor) list, you 
invite them to more things," said County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, 
who serves on the MTA board. "And they do have more of a chance to get their 
ideas over to you." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As agency officials are confronting the role that campaign contributions play, 
they also are seeking to restore confidence in the MTA. This fall, after ground 
subsidence occurred above subway tunnels in Hollywood, the federal government 
questioned the competence of the MTA's construction management and froze $1.6 
billion in funding until organizational changes were promised. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that Los Angeles city and county officials serving on the 
13-member MTA board have gotten by far the most campaign money from transit 
contractors, with County Supervisor Deane Dana and Mayor Richard Riordan 
receiving the largest amounts. In addition to the five county supervisors, the 
MTA board is composed of Riordan, three appointees of the mayor and four 
representatives from outlying cities. 
</P>
<P>
 State law prohibits board members from voting on any contract award that was 
not competitively bid or on regulatory matters affecting a donor who has given 
$250 or more within the previous 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 This routinely causes some MTA board members to abstain from voting on certain 
contract awards. After the one-year period has passed, other members have 
repeatedly voted in support of the positions favored by their contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 A limitation of the existing law was demonstrated in November when Riordan, 
despite having received nearly $10,000 in 1993 from employees of a consulting 
firm he wanted the MTA to hire, found a way to participate legally in a 
contract award. 
</P>
<P>
 After determining that only a single, $500 contribution from a partner of the 
firm was made in the preceding 12 months, the mayor announced his solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we've done," Riordan told a transit committee meeting, "is we've 
returned $251 of (the $500 contribution) -- so that I guess I don't have a 
conflict. Is that right?" 
</P>
<P>
 "That's correct," responded a county transit lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 The next week, Riordan helped award a $500,000 contract to the consultant, 
Arthur Andersen & Co., whose price was higher than five other competitors. The 
firm is to evaluate the MTA's construction management and make recommendations 
for how it can best be reorganized. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Riordan, who declined to be interviewed, said campaign 
contributions do not affect the mayor's decisions. "His criteria for those 
decisions is what's in the best interest of the citizens who live here and the 
businesses that are doing business here," press secretary Noelia Rodriguez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other elected officials say that contributions do not guide their votes, 
either. "If you take a contribution from someone with business in front of you, 
you've got to be strong enough to be able to say no to them," said Los Angeles 
County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who from 1987 through 1993 accepted at least 
$44,000 from rail contractors. "If you can't say no -- don't take it." 
</P>
<P>
 But some who serve on the MTA board said they believe campaign contributions 
generally have helped contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has to -- sure it has an impact," said Marvin L. Holen, a lawyer who has 
served on the board of the MTA and its predecessor agencies over the last 20 
years. "It provides access." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cragin, who as a member of the Gardena City Council has not accepted 
Metro Rail-related campaign contributions, "I think that (campaign money) 
influences a director's vote." 
</P>
<P>
 One former transit official, noting that hundreds of millions of dollars of 
engineering services contracts are awarded on the basis of "qualifications" 
instead of sealed competitive bids, said campaign contributions can make a 
difference in the awarding of those contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a wheeling-dealing atmosphere . . . where campaign contributions may 
have a significant bearing," said James Pott, a professional engineer who left 
the Rail Construction Corp. board in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Alatorre, who has received $36,500 in contributions from more than a dozen 
rail contractors, said that the money does not influence his actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to make it real clear -- whether someone gives me money or not, (it) 
doesn't put me in a compromising position," Alatorre said. "I can vote against 
them as easily as I can vote for them. My reputation is more important than 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Six months ago, while Alatorre was still chairman of the MTA, companies 
holding rail contracts supported a golf tournament staged for his campaign 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
 One subcontractor who contributed money for the event said in an interview 
that smaller firms, too, are strongly encouraged to donate by the prime 
contractors who hire them. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm going after work with the MTA, they expect me to give to Alatorre and 
others on that board," said the subcontractor, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity out of fear of retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Alatorre confirmed that some rail contractors also have contributed to a 
favorite nonprofit charity of his, the El Sereno Youth Center. The group's 
first major fund-raiser was a dinner two years ago honoring Alatorre at the 
Biltmore Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Moret, a former aide to Alatorre and a founding director of the youth 
center, said that currying favor with Alatorre is not "the overriding reason" 
contractors paid to attend. "People write checks because they believe in the 
cause," Moret said. "And the cause is a very noble one." 
</P>
<P>
 Most contractors contacted by The Times declined to discuss their reasons for 
making campaign contributions to MTA board members. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a really strict, standard policy that we don't discuss campaign 
contributions," said Debra Lambeck, vice president and general counsel for the 
Daniel, Mann, Johnson & Mendenhall engineering firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael L. Shank, a Denver-based contractor whose joint venture built subway 
tunnels now in service between Pershing Square and MacArthur Park, said he 
believes political influence counts in Los Angeles. Shank said he suspects that 
it can affect the enforcement of construction quality requirements and the 
outcome of requests for contract increases. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm convinced it's not a level playing field in L.A.," said Shank, who 
refused to make campaign contributions and said he no longer will bid on 
transit projects here. "Unless you have some influence, it's suicide to go in 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Another firm, CRSS Constructors Inc., which last year won a contract to help 
manage construction of an $850-million above-ground rail line from Downtown to 
Pasadena, indicated that contributions cannot be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our political system puts significant financial campaign pressure on those 
seeking office," a spokesman for CRSS said. "As long as this pressure exists, 
campaign contributions will be part of the (MTA contracting) environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that over the last decade, the three construction-related 
contractors who have won the greatest value in contracts also have contributed 
the most money to politicians on the MTA board. Each company has become 
embroiled in problems that have fallen under the purview of board members who 
received donations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tutor-Saliba Corp. The Sylmar-based firm has contributed more than $62,000 
to current MTA board members and has won, through competitive bids and contract 
amendments, more than $500 million worth of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Although sealed, competitive bids typically leave MTA board members with 
little discretionary authority, the board has exercised latitude with a number 
of contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Tutor-Saliba was in jeopardy of losing $73 million worth of 
station construction contracts in late 1993 after The Times reported 
deficiencies in the firm's building of Downtown subway tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
 After lengthy debate, MTA board members deadlocked and could not muster the 
votes to award the contracts. But staff warned that a delay would be costly, 
and Tutor-Saliba's president urged the board to withhold judgment of his firm's 
earlier work until specialists reported their findings. 
</P>
<P>
 The board approved an extraordinary compromise: Tutor-Saliba was awarded the 
new contracts -- on condition that the MTA board could terminate the pacts 
after reviewing the specialists' findings. When those findings were reported in 
February, Tutor-Saliba agreed to make extensive repairs. No MTA board member 
has suggested reconsidering the award of the station-construction contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, Tutor-Saliba was rejected as the low bidder on a new 
$70-million station construction contract after the MTA's chief executive 
officer, Franklin E. White, alleged that the firm had listed an improperly 
certified minority subcontractor. 
</P>
<P>
 At the MTA's Oct. 26 meeting, White's authority to block the contract was 
challenged unsuccessfully by Supervisor Dana's appointee to the MTA board, 
Robert Arthur. 
</P>
<P>
 During the meeting, Dana's chief of staff, Donald R. Knabe, privately 
complained to a county lawyer who had advised the board that White was 
empowered to reject all bids. 
</P>
<P>
 "We (Dana's office) were a little bit concerned . . . that the final decision 
rested in the hands of the CEO," Arthur said. "The low bidder, Ron Tutor, met 
all the qualifications for good faith." 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur said he was aware that Tutor was a major contributor to Dana's 
campaigns, but did not discuss the matter with the contractor. He said that he 
and Dana have abstained in many other instances to avoid even the "suspicion of 
an impropriety." 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald N. Tutor, president of Tutor-Saliba, has said he donated to Dana 
because he thought he was a good supervisor. But he said this month that he 
would cease. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not contributing to anybody on that board anymore," Tutor said. 
"Nothing. Nada. So I won't be part of those stories anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported in December, 1992, that Knabe and another Dana aide, acting 
as the supervisor's appointees to the transit board, had cast 29 votes 
approving $45.8 million in contract increases for Tutor-Saliba. This prompted a 
state law that prohibits appointees of elected officials from granting 
contracts to campaign contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Parsons Brinckerhoff. The New York-based company leads a consortium of 
design-engineering firms that have donated more than $36,000 to MTA members. 
The group has won about $300 million worth of contracts, awarded at the 
discretion of transit board members. 
</P>
<P>
 In a matter being watched closely by the MTA, the chief tunnel engineer that 
Parsons Brinckerhoff has assigned to the Los Angeles subway project is under 
scrutiny by a state licensing agency for engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 The engineer, Timothy P. Smirnoff, is not licensed to practice civil 
engineering in California. He was one of two officials who approved the 
substitution of wooden wedges, instead of metal struts, for bracing of tunnels 
along a stretch of Hollywood Boulevard that has sunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Based in part on the results of the state's inquiry into the Hollywood 
tunneling problems and Smirnoff's licensing status, White said he will 
determine whether to seek remuneration from Parsons Brinckerhoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials have said that Smirnoff did not need a California license 
because his work has been overseen by a state-licensed engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons Brinckerhoff Chairman Martin Rubin said contributions generally do not 
influence how MTA members vote on a particular project. "The thing that I 
object to is the inference there's something dirty about political 
contributions," he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 * Parsons Corp. The company, which controls Parsons-Dillingham, the MTA's 
subway inspection management firm, has contributed about $25,000 directly and 
through its employees and has received contracts worth more than $260 million. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a year, Parsons-Dillingham has been at the center of 
controversies regarding deficient construction of subway tunnels Downtown and, 
more recently, along Vermont Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 An independent review for the MTA concluded that Parsons-Dillingham fell short 
of "acceptable industry practice" in its supervision of the work Downtown, 
where numerous sections of Tutor-Saliba's tunnels were built with concrete 
thinner than designed. 
</P>
<P>
 White has expressed outrage that Parsons-Dillingham inspectors also allowed a 
different tunneling contractor to excavate along Vermont and Hollywood without 
placing a high-strength grout material around the wooden wedges, as required. 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons-Dillingham has defended its inspections and in a letter to the MTA 
accused the contractor, Shea-Kiewit-Kenny, of deliberately concealing the 
deficient work from inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance of Parsons-Dillingham also is being reviewed by the state 
engineering board. A Parsons-Dillingham "resident engineer," the second 
official who approved the substitution of wooden wedges is not licensed by the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Parsons-Dillingham have said that he did not need a license 
because he has not practiced civil engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 Although White has voiced displeasure, MTA board members have not moved either 
to terminate Parsons-Dillingham or to block the firm from seeking new Metro 
Rail contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why the company has contributed to the campaigns of MTA board members, a 
spokesman for Parsons Corp., based in Pasadena, issued this statement: 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . We support candidates at all levels of government throughout the 
nation. Parsons believes that businesses and individual citizens should 
exercise their right to participate in the political process."

FISCAL CRISIS THREATENS ANAHEIM'S GRAND PLANS; DEVELOPMENT: THE CITY'S 
BLUEPRINT FOR THE NEXT CENTURY IS STALLED, BUT OFFICIALS VOW TO PURSUE THEIR 
GOALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 December was the month when this city, home of Disneyland and three 
professional sports teams, expected to add the final details to its blueprint 
for the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials hoped to reach an agreement by year's end to build a new 
baseball stadium for the California Angels and to choose the designer for a 
dazzling entertainment complex that would surround it. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving ahead with that project and the Anaheim Resort -- a $172-million 
renovation proposed for the area surrounding Disneyland -- was the key to the 
city's plan to spruce up its shabby commercial areas, widen streets and make 
itself over as a modern metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's Dec. 6 bankruptcy filing, however, rocked the city, which had 
$169 million, or about 20% of its money, in an investment pool that has lost 
$2.02 billion through risky investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial crisis raised serious doubts about whether Anaheim can proceed 
with its ambitious redevelopment, but city officials vow that they will 
proceed. "This is a bump in the road," said James D. Ruth, Anaheim's city 
manager. "It's going to hurt, but there are ways to deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
 The city faces other potential setbacks, though. The Los Angeles Rams are 
reportedly close to announcing plans to move to St. Louis, in spite of an 
intense effort by community leaders to keep the football team with enticements 
that include a new or renovated stadium for football only, rather than one 
shared with the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's newest professional team, the popular Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, had 
a spectacular first season performing to sold-out houses at the new city-built 
arena, The Pond. That success is expected to continue if the National Hockey 
League can settle its labor dispute, which has stalled the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The week before the bankruptcy filing, Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly met with Rams 
President John Shaw to assure him that the city is serious about keeping the 
team. A detailed proposal for a new stadium was to have followed, but city 
officials have had to focus instead on financial crisis management rather than 
strategic planning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The timing could not be worse," Leigh Steinberg, co-chairman of Save the 
Rams, said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations with the Angels, too, have been postponed, dashing earlier hopes 
that an agreement on a new stadium could be sealed by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still hopeful in terms of Rams negotiations and optimistic about the 
Angels, but this is obviously not the right time to sit down and cut deals," 
Ruth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are also anxious to see what effect the financial setback will have 
on Walt Disney Co.'s proposal to build a $3-billion resort next to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's plan is insulated somewhat from the county's money problems because 
it does not depend on public money. But county-financed roads and other 
infrastructure improvements to have been part of the project could be in 
jeopardy, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, there will be some impact," said Michael Johnson, manager of 
communications for Walt Disney Development Co. "But we are going to look for 
ways to keep our plan for a project in Anaheim on track and work closely with 
Anaheim officials to see that we're able to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Daly said he is optimistic that the city will continue its progress on 
several fronts, even if it has to take a different approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the county bankruptcy makes clearer than ever is that we will have to 
rely on partnerships with the private sector to build major projects," Daly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's financial crisis, though, "was like being hit between the eyes," 
said Anaheim Councilman Bob Zemel, who was sworn into office on Nov. 29, just 
two days before news of the investment pool loss. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is not clear yet how much the city is out. Anaheim invested heavily in 
the county investment pool. And, because that strategy netted the city a total 
of $12 million in revenue for the past three years, officials borrowed $94 
million early in 1994 solely to invest in the fund, Ruth said. That loan comes 
due in April, and it is not clear where the city will get the money to pay back 
the loan if it loses some of the principal invested with the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time, it was a very prudent business decision, and we were advised 
that it was almost no-risk," Ruth said. "We feel somewhat misled." 
</P>
<P>
 In a worst-case scenario, the city could lose as much as $45 million out of 
the $169 million it had put in the county fund, Ruth said. Until city officials 
learn the final figure, they have put a hold on all new capital improvement 
projects, instituted a city hiring freeze and canceled an order for a new fleet 
of city vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on the Anaheim Resort project is continuing, though, with the city 
placing overhead utility lines underground. 
</P>
<P>
 Zemel said the council has no contingency plan yet to deal with a major loss 
and that any solution will have to include a way to proceed with major projects 
like the Disney resort and baseball stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very important that Anaheim not be knocked backward by this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have made several moves to regain their momentum, including a 
meeting last week with 50 members of the Anaheim Chamber of Commerce to update 
them on the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "They gave us a relatively upbeat presentation," said Jay Walton, government 
affairs manager for the group. "The bankruptcy doesn't help, but these dreams 
can still happen." 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Ruth said that in January the city is "going to hit the track 
running" and resume meetings with the Angels and Disney. Also, he said, the 
council will vote on a consulting firm to develop an updated land-use strategy 
for the stadium area, a step that officials say much be taken regardless of 
what the Rams do. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an extremely vital city, and we see it moving forward," Ruth said. 
"We are going to set the tone for this entire county. Anaheim will be the 
leader."

AMID CHECHNYA SIEGE, YELTSIN CLAIMS VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his first public appearance since sending thousands of Russian troops into 
the breakaway republic of Chechnya, Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin 
announced Monday that the military operation to crush the rebels had mainly 
succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as Yeltsin was delivering an upbeat evaluation of the results of the 
bloody, 2-week-old campaign to subdue the still-defiant Chechens, other Russian 
officials warned that rebel commandos had reinforced their positions around the 
palace still held by Dzhokar M. Dudayev, the Chechen president. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,000 Chechen gunmen armed with 34 armored vehicles, missile launchers 
and antiaircraft guns had completed a defensive ring around the bomb-shattered 
capital of Grozny, about half a mile from the presidential palace, the Russian 
government press service said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen captured Russian soldiers are still being held inside the besieged 
city, where water, electricity, bandages and medicine are reportedly running 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 At a session of the Russian Security Council, Yeltsin announced plans for a 
military occupation of Chechnya in which the tens of thousands of Russian 
troops now in the Muslim republic would remain there. Police units would be 
responsible for restoring order. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have approached the point where we can wrap up the military operation and 
switch to the second stage -- that of forming administrative bodies in the 
Chechen republic," Yeltsin told the council meeting. "We have come close to 
restoring constitutional law and order there." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Russian troops might be moved away from Grozny to unspecified bases 
but said the soldiers will stay in Chechnya "permanently." 
</P>
<P>
 "Chechnya is our republic, and nobody should forget it," Yeltsin said. 
</P>
<P>
 He declared that the army had performed "not badly" and said officials had 
done a good job of providing minimal living standards for the estimated 200,000 
refugees who have fled the bombing and shelling of the residential 
neighborhoods of Grozny and its suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian government press service announced that a provisional government 
headed by Salambek N. Khajiyev -- a 53-year-old chemist and Soviet-era oil 
executive who has been active in the anti-Dudayev opposition -- was being set 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 Khajiyev flew to Moscow on Monday and held a news conference at which he 
bluntly answered those who would call his Government of National Reconciliation 
a Russian puppet. 
</P>
<P>
 "You must be asking yourselves, How legitimate is this body?" Khajiyev said. 
"It is as legitimate as the Dudayev regime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all know very well that nobody elected Dudayev," he said, referring to the 
disputed elections that brought Dudayev to power in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, after refusing an offer to become Dudayev's prime minister, 
Khajiyev said he had no doubt that if given a chance, Chechens would vote 
against being part of Russia. "We must acquire our statehood, real and not 
puppet," he told the newspaper Izvestia. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Khajiyev called on Moscow to stop bombing Grozny, where "only 
civilians are suffering." He called for new, free elections to resolve 
Chechnya's fate. "The people will decide who is legitimate," he said, adding, 
"Dudayev must resign and leave Chechnya if he really cares about the welfare of 
his people." 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, Khajiyev said, his main task is to restore Chechnya's economy, which 
has been ravaged by a Russian economic blockade, as well as the schools, 
hospitals and social welfare system that have crumbled in the three years since 
Dudayev declared independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's Russian Security Council meeting had been billed as a showdown 
between the hawks and doves within the Kremlin, who have been fighting as 
fiercely as the Chechen guerrillas for influence over Yeltsin. It was unclear 
who had prevailed, because, after a long closed session, senior officials 
emerged to make characteristically contradictory statements as to what will 
happen next. 
</P>
<P>
 Nikolai D. Yegorov, nationalities minister and a deputy prime minister, told 
the Interfax news agency that it was imperative that Grozny be seized quickly 
and that criminal gangs -- presumably Dudayev supporters -- be disarmed. 
Yegorov insisted that most Chechens oppose negotiations with Dudayev and want 
him ousted. 
</P>
<P>
 Vladimir F. Shumeiko -- another senior Yeltsin adviser and head of the 
Federation Council, or upper house of Parliament -- said Russia's Security 
Council had authorized Yegorov, Sergei V. Stepashin, the head of the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service, and Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin, a commander in 
Chechnya, to negotiate for a cease-fire and rebel disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sign that dissent against Yeltsin's Chechnya policy will not be 
tolerated, the Russian Defense Ministry confirmed Monday that it had prepared 
orders to sack three deputy defense ministers who have spoken out against the 
military crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was no word on whether Yeltsin had signed the decree dismissing the 
distinguished generals: Boris V. Gromov, the much-decorated commander of the 
Soviet troops in Afghanistan; Grigory Kondratiev, and Valery Mironov. 
</P>
<P>
 The estrangement between Yeltsin and his former democratic allies deepened 
Monday when Father Gleb P. Yakunin and Lev A. Ponomarev -- two heroes of 
Russia's pro-democracy movement -- quit the Russia's Choice bloc to protest 
Yeltsin's Chechnya policy and called for early presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin had sharp words for another old ally, Sergei A. Kovalev, his human 
rights commissioner, who has stayed in Grozny -- despite orders for civilians 
to leave -- to protest the bombing there. Kovalev further embarrassed Yeltsin 
by telling the Washington Post that the United States should revise its 
hands-off policy toward Russian intervention in Chechnya because the current 
human rights violations are of international concern and not a purely Russian 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin snapped back Monday, saying that he shared Kovalev's concern for human 
rights but adding that he wondered why the commissioner had not expressed 
concern over the violence of Dudayev's regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the presidential administration offices near the Kremlin, 24 human 
rights activists from the group Memorial were arrested after staging a peaceful 
but unlicensed anti-war protest.

AFTER-CHRISTMAS DISCOUNTS DRAW THRONGS OF SHOPPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Consumers flocked to Southland malls and other retail centers nationwide 
Monday to take advantage of what some called the biggest day of price-cutting 
in years. 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional day-after-Christmas clearance sales were even more evident 
because consumer demand -- although up from last year's holiday season -- did 
not meet the heady expectations of most retailers, analysts said. Thus, stores 
had much more unsold merchandise to clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rip-roaring Christmas didn't materialize and retailers marked down 
merchandise until the pencil wore away," said Kurt Barnard, a New Jersey-based 
economist and publisher of the Retail Marketing Report newsletter. "The 
discounts today are the biggest in a dozen years and consumers are going for 
these bargains." 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, the surge of shoppers and sunny weather were welcomed 
by retailers who had been somewhat disappointed by the turnout on a drizzly 
Christmas Eve. However, Southland merchants appeared to enjoy a slightly larger 
increase in overall holiday sales this year than the nation as a whole, 
industry analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 At South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, Annie VanScoy and her daughter, Kristy 
DeLuca, took a lunch break after three hours of solid bargain hunting and lined 
up with at least 100 other exhausted shoppers waiting for a seat at Vie de 
France Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 The two had hit at least six shops and were bound for as many more after 
lunch, VanScoy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tired. Yesterday was a long day with getting up early to make the turkey, 
and I had to get up early again today," she said. "It's just as bad as a 
regular hectic workday." 
</P>
<P>
 The shopping frenzy was just as tough on some retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been crazy," said salesman Ted O'Brien of A Wonderful Christmas Store in 
the Brea Mall, where more than a dozen lighted trees displayed the store's 
hundreds of discounted Christmas ornaments. Some ornaments, included a few 
shattered ones, littered the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were irate if they didn't get what they wanted," said O'Brien, who 
opened his doors at 8 a.m. to hundreds of people lined up. "Our store looks 
like it was hit by a whirlwind from ceiling to floor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But O'Brien said he was glad for the business. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was far above our expectations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although final tallies are not complete, Southern California is expected to 
post a 6% increase in overall holiday sales over a year ago, compared to a gain 
of between 5% and 5.5% nationwide, said Richard Giss, a partner in the retail 
services division of accounting giant Deloitte & Touche. 
</P>
<P>
 "For Southern California, that's a real strong performance relative to recent 
years," Giss said. "Nationally, that increase is acceptable, but a little 
disappointing considering expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Southland retailers -- who successfully used sales promotions in 
recent years to cope with a lingering state recession -- showed that they have 
become masters of the markdown. Most offered big discounts for the day, with 
even bigger price cuts available to early birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers responded to these deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Packer, who said she had not shopped on the day after Christmas in 20 
years, was one of nearly 50 people gathered for the 8 a.m. opening of the 
Broadway in the Beverly Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here early because of the coupon," Packer said, pulling a clipped 
certificate offering an extra 10% discount to those buying before 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom and Tori Venturi of Los Angeles, also arriving early at the Broadway, said 
they had purchased gifts for their children but had put off shopping for each 
other until after Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We waited because you get more bang for your buck today," Tom Venturi said. 
"We're here early and should be able to get in and out in about an hour." 
</P>
<P>
 "Make that two hours," Tori Venturi said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Fox Hills Mall in Culver City, the CardAmerica card and gift shop opened 
about half an hour early at the insistence of a line of customers, said store 
manager Kim Wiley. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'Let us in. We have money to spend,' " Wiley said. 
</P>
<P>
 And upstairs -- at King's Hallmark card shop -- about 50 people buzzed outside 
until the store lifted the gates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unbelievable!" shouted Denise Williams, taking photographs of the crowd as 
they rushed into the small shop. Williams, in a training program for Hallmark 
store ownership, said the crowd was responding to discounts of 50% on cards, 
gift items and chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
 At Topanga Plaza in Canoga Park, dozens of holiday shoppers had lined up in 
front of stores by 7:30 a.m. By midday, the mall's 5,400 parking spaces were 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buy, buy, buy! That's what we're here for," said Anastasia Hendrix, who stood 
in a long line at the Gap, holding a striped turtleneck. "I don't do any 
shopping the day before Christmas. There's no incentive." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the largest incentives were offered by department stores, which opened 
one to two hours earlier than usual. All the major chains -- Bullock's, 
Robinsons-May, Broadway and Nordstrom among them -- offered up to 50% off on 
many items. 
</P>
<P>
 I. Magnin entered the beginning of its final post-Christmas sale period by 
offering 70% off on dresses. R. H. Macy & Co., operator of Bullock's and I. 
Magnin, last month announced that would close the 12-store I. Magnin chain by 
early January. On Sunday, the company said that three I. Magnins -- in 
Pasadena, Palm Desert and Palos Verdes -- would close permanently at 6 p.m. 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the I. Magnin stores will be converted to Bullock's or Macy's. Saks 
Fifth Avenue will acquire four of the remaining seven stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Retailers that traditionally cut prices in December -- among them sporting 
goods and consumer electronics chains -- were also offering their lowest prices 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the largest price cuts were found at specialty apparel stores and in 
clothing sections of department stores because garment sales continue to suffer 
from a three-year slump nationwide. Even with the lure of lower prices, many 
consumers have showed little interest in clothing during the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Dayton Hudson Corp. -- operator of the Mervyn's and Target chains -- said 
clothing sales were slow Monday. Clothing traditionally accounts for about 80% 
of Mervyn's sales. 
</P>
<P>
 This winter's warmer weather was partly to blame nationwide, lessening demand 
for sweaters and other heavy clothing. Apparel sales, however, have been a bit 
stronger in Southern California -- where weather is less of a factor in sales, 
Deloitte & Touche's Giss said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that sellers of consumer electronics -- items such as cellular 
telephones and facsimile machines -- were among the Southland merchants with 
the strongest holiday sales season. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, jewelry -- with a 10.1% increase -- had the biggest sales gain of 
the season from Thanksgiving weekend through Christmas Eve, according to a 
report released Monday by the International Council of Shopping Centers, a 
trade group representing most of the nation's malls. Apparel had the season's 
smallest increase -- only 1.4%, the council said. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the council's survey showed a 3.2% increase in sales for the season 
nationally. However, that tally only includes shopping centers and does not 
cover department stores or major discount chains.

 Other surveys show that consumers were increasingly value-conscious and 
dependent on credit. TeleCheck, a check acceptance service, reported that the 
dollar amount of purchases made with checks rose only 2.2% for Nov. 25 through 
Dec. 21 over the same period last year. However, MasterCard said sales 
authorizations from Thanksgiving weekend through Christmas Eve climbed to 
$17.38 billion, a 35.2% jump from last year.

FOR LITERARY STUDIES HAS SUNK INTO SELF-PARODY.

<P>
 It's been called the annual "Gong Show" of the academic world. It's been 
derided as an anxious, exploitative festival, complete with its own jargon, 
dress code and etiquette. But perhaps the simplest description of the Modern 
Language Assn. convention is the one Molly Hite once overheard in the San 
Francisco airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The time was 2:30 a.m., and Hite, a Cornell University professor, was waiting 
for her baggage amid a throng of other convention-bound scholars. Suddenly, a 
man began shouting into a public telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't get anything from any of the car rentals!" he said frantically, his 
voice cracking as he tried to persuade the person on the other end to get up, 
get dressed and come fetch him. "Don't you understand? There are 10,000 English 
teachers in this town!" 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the strange ritual that is known simply as "the MLA" begins in San 
Diego -- a trade show of the mind where books are known as "texts" and soup 
stains down the front of your shirt are seen, as Hite puts it, "as a possible 
accessory." Over the next four days, the nation's scholars of English, 
literature, linguistics and modern foreign languages will gather to consider 
their craft, exchanging views about teaching, trends in scholarship and one 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting, a magnet for literary luminaries, is also known for high levels 
of angst, primarily because this is where graduate students in the humanities 
must go to be interviewed for jobs. "Not only is your future being decided, 
it's being decided if you have one," said one sympathetic professor. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is as a showcase for cutting-edge -- and some say downright silly -- 
scholarship that the convention has become famous. Some journalists have mocked 
the convention for its preponderance of papers about race, class and sexuality 
(some too graphic to be reprinted here). Others, such as conservative columnist 
George F. Will, have lamented that literary criticism -- a staple of many MLA 
sessions -- has begun to overshadow literature itself. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, however, the criticism is coming from within academia. In recent 
months, a new scholarly group has surfaced that some are calling the 
"Anti-MLA": the Assn. of Literary Scholars and Critics, a Southern 
California-based professional society that describes itself as holding to 
"broad conceptions of literature rather than the narrow, highly politicized 
ones often encountered today." 
</P>
<P>
 Ricardo Quinones, a Dante scholar at Claremont McKenna College who is 
president of the new society, said the group was born out of a concern that 
literary scholarship is becoming irrelevant because it is being "overtaken by 
political correctness and multiculturalism" -- not to mention sex. 
</P>
<P>
 A quick perusal of this year's program -- which includes presentations such as 
"Victorian Buggery and the Sensation of Scandal," "Ever Embodying Ambiguities: 
The Monkey as a Signifier in Asian American Literature," and a three-part 
session on gay and lesbian themes called "Que(e)rying the Millennium" -- gives 
Quinones all the ammunition he needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Self-parody can go no further. If the MLA closed down, there'd be no business 
for stand-up comedians," Quinones said, referring to what he called the "narrow 
agendas" reflected in such scholarly work. "All these little bits about sex -- 
it's just unbelievable! It's as if these (scholars) are children who have just 
discovered they have sexual parts." 
</P>
<P>
 Quinones stresses that his group is not strictly anti-MLA, but springs from 
discontent with what he calls faddish scholarship "that includes the MLA." 
Literary scholarship can contain an emphasis on race, class and gender. But too 
often lately, Quinones says, those aspects are held in higher esteem than the 
work itself. The business of literature must be refocused, he says, or else 
"become more and more discounted." 
</P>
<P>
 With only a few more than 400 members, the Assn. of Literary Scholars and 
Critics hardly threatens to replace the MLA, whose 31,000 members make it the 
largest humanities association in the country. Still, the fledgling society 
raises legitimate questions about the future of literary scholarship -- 
questions that Patricia Meyer Spacks, the MLA's president, says she welcomes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's splendid that there's a new organization to talk about 
literature. The more the merrier," said Spacks, who chairs the English 
department at the University of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Spacks rejects the suggestion that the MLA convention -- where 2,100 papers 
are presented on every subject from 17th-Century French literature to popular 
culture -- has become too narrow. New ideas should be aired, she believes, and 
younger scholars must have a chance to try their wings. Moreover, she asserts 
that the gathering still has something for everyone, be they trendy or 
traditional. 
</P>
<P>
 But she agrees that the MLA cannot do everything. In addition to holding an 
annual convention, now in its 110th year, the MLA publishes the world's leading 
bibliography of books and articles on language, literature, linguistics and 
folklore. It puts out the MLA Handbook, a style guide for writers. And it 
publishes the Job Information List -- the definitive tally of openings at 
colleges and universities that is the bible for those entering the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is, as one professor puts it, "the mother MLA" -- an umbrella 
organization that welcomes Dickens scholars, Old Norse language buffs, Marxists 
and medievalists all under the same roof. It seems inevitable, many say, that 
when splinter groups form, they often define themselves in opposition to the 
MLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the psychoanalytical theory of transference," said Spacks, who 
contends that her organization often seems to become "the focus of anger at 
whatever seems to be the Establishment of the moment." 
</P>
<P>
 The convention has also been a frequent target for satirists. In the mystery 
novel "Murder at the MLA" by D.J.H. Jones, a non-tenured professor is driven to 
violence when a colleague implies that she is "professionally inert." And in 
David Lodge's popular sendup of the conference-hopping professorial set, "Small 
World: An Academic Romance," the MLA is everyone's ultimate destination. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine 10,000 highly educated, articulate, ambitious, competitive men and 
women converging . . . to meet and to lecture and to question and to discuss 
and to gossip and to plot and to philander and to party and to hire or be 
hired," Lodge writes of what he calls "the Big Daddy of conferences. A 
megaconference. A three-ring circus of the literary intelligentsia." 
</P>
<P>
 Explains one of Lodge's characters, a self-described "post-structuralist" 
professor from a California university called Euphoric State: "Everybody is at 
the MLA. Everybody you ever knew." 
</P>
<P>
 This year is no different. At a session called "20 Years of Feminism: Erica 
Jong's 'Fear of Flying' as a Window on the History of a Political Movement," 
Jong herself is scheduled to be present. The next day, Denise Levertov, one of 
America's most respected poets, will give a reading. 
</P>
<P>
 Also scheduled are "hot" professors whose reputations for controversial 
scholarship are expected to draw big crowds. Among them: Andrew Ross of New 
York University, whose latest book of so-called eco-criticism explores 
literature's relation to nature, and Harvard University's Marjorie Garber, who 
has traced cross-dressing from Shakespeare to Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
 But a lot of the action takes place outside the formal sessions. There are 
casual star sightings ("I was in the elevator," one MLA-goer was once heard to 
exclaim, "with Norman Mailer!"). There are reunions with friends. And at the 
end of each day, this year's 10,000 attendees will have their choice of 
countless parties and cash bars sponsored by everyone from the Edith Wharton 
Society to the American Assn. of Professors of Yiddish. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think very many people go to the MLA convention to learn," said 
Robert Tracy, a professor of English and Celtic studies at UC Berkeley. "They 
go for jobs and they go to drink and hang around." 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, the job market has been so dire it could drive a scholar to drink. 
Just ask aspiring professors such as Danielle Price, a 28-year-old Ph.D. 
candidate at UCLA whose dissertation explores gender and nature in Victorian 
and modern British literature. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the drawbacks of going to the MLA is running into a lot of people who 
are very tense," said Price, who this year found only 14 job openings in her 
field in the United States and Canada. "When you think about the number of jobs 
and the number of applicants -- well, it's better not to think about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The dearth of jobs, combined with the rising number of Ph.D.s granted in 
English and foreign languages, has created a "miasma of despair that hangs in 
the air at the MLA," said Niko Pfund, editor-in-chief of New York University 
Press, one of 118 academic publishers that will exhibit their wares at the 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation has grown so alarming that the MLA is kicking off the convention 
today with a special meeting of the heads of Ph.D.-granting English and 
language departments. The three-hour session will focus on what should be done 
to address the bottleneck that is leaving many of the nation's newest scholars 
stranded without work. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are real questions," Spacks said. "Should we stop training Ph.D.s? 
Should we cut way back?" 
</P>
<P>
 With such grim possibilities on the horizon, the MLA mood might be intolerably 
gloomy if not for a heartening discovery: The convention is developing a 
lighter side. MLA members, so often mocked as sober frumps, appear to be 
developing their senses of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Listed among the 774 events in the program is a "metapanel" called "How to 
Stop a Long-Winded Speaker." It features four critiques of the pomposity 
problem -- one Marxist, one feminist, one psychoanalytic and one modeled on the 
work of the late French philosopher Michel Foucault, whose theories about power 
and control often pop up in literary criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to be that long in this profession to get a keen sense (that) 
people who have been professors for decades don't have the foggiest notion of 
what 10 minutes is," said David Chioni Moore, a graduate student from Duke 
University who is moderating the panel. "The best medicine for these types of 
things is a little deflationary humor." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is "Genderless Child of Humor of the MLA: Can You Top This?" -- 
an open "anecdotefest" about MLA and the profession, organized by the American 
Humor Studies Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope that people will rise and tell of their worst moments, or their most 
comic," said Eric Solomon, an English professor at San Francisco State 
University who attended his first convention in 1950. "Self-parody, 
reflexiveness -- they're very much in vogue." 
</P>
<P>
 MLA veterans say there is plenty to chuckle about. A sampling: 
</P>
<P>
 MLA Jargon: Geoffrey Green, an English professor at San Francisco State, notes 
that MLA members always use the word reread (as in, "I'm rereading 
'Middlemarch' "). "To say one is reading 'Middlemarch,' " Green explains, 
"might be construed as appearing to suggest that one had not previously read 
the book -- perish the thought! -- hence we reread in order to make clear that 
we have read." 
</P>
<P>
 MLA Etiquette: There is, apparently, only one way to board an elevator at this 
convention. First, you wait, sometimes for a good long time. Then, once you 
step on, "you speedily look around to read all the name tags," said Mary Moore, 
who has just completed her Ph.D. in Renaissance poetry at UC Davis. "You need 
to see if there is (a) someone there from a university where you applied, (b) 
someone who will be interviewing you or (c) somebody famous." 
</P>
<P>
 MLA Dress Code: Hite, the Cornell professor, observes that while people in 
other professions make fashion statements, academics "are uncharacteristically 
mute. Academic gear is simply there. It covers, it warms. . . It also 
guarantees that when 10,000 (scholars) . . . descend on a given city, the local 
populace can spot immediately which ones they are." 
</P>
<P>
 They are the ones with the comfortable footwear, the leather-clad elbows and 
the stains down the front of their shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) The Paper Chase 
</P>
<P>
 You are going to deliver an academic paper at the Modern Language Assn. 
convention, but first you need a title. Deadlines require that you submit your 
title eight months before the meeting convenes. The first problem: You're not 
sure yet what you want to say. The second problem: You want to persuade your 
peers to come hear your paper instead of the 2,100 others on the program. The 
result: Many MLA paper titles sound a lot like the names of alternative rock 
bands. Here is a sampling:

DEEP DISCOUNTS DRAW THRONGS OF SHOPPERS; BUSINESS: SOUTHLAND IS EXPECTED TO 
POST 6% INCREASE IN HOLIDAY SALES. BUT RETAILERS STILL HAD PLENTY TO GET RID 
OF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Consumers flocked to Southland malls and other retail centers nationwide 
Monday to take advantage of what some called the biggest day of price-cutting 
in years. 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional day-after-Christmas clearance sales were even more evident 
because consumer demand -- although up from last year's holiday season -- did 
not meet the heady expectations of most retailers, analysts said. Thus, stores 
had much more unsold merchandise to clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rip-roaring Christmas didn't materialize and retailers marked down 
merchandise until the pencil wore away," said Kurt Barnard, a New Jersey-based 
economist and publisher of the Retail Marketing Report newsletter. "The 
discounts today are the biggest in a dozen years and consumers are going for 
these bargains." 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, the surge of shoppers and sunny weather was welcomed 
by retailers who were somewhat disappointed by the turnout on a drizzly 
Christmas Eve. However, Southland merchants appeared to enjoy a slightly larger 
increase in overall holiday sales this year than the nation as a whole, 
industry analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although final tallies are not complete, Southern California is expected to 
post a 6% increase in overall holiday sales over a year ago, compared to a gain 
of between 5% and 5.5% nationwide, said Richard Giss, a partner in the retail 
services division of accounting giant Deloitte & Touche. 
</P>
<P>
 "For Southern California, that's a real strong performance relative to recent 
years," Giss said. "Nationally, that increase is acceptable, but a little 
disappointing considering expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Southland retailers -- who successfully used sales promotions in 
recent years to cope with a lingering state recession -- showed that they have 
become masters of the mark-down. Most offered big discounts for the day, with 
even bigger price cuts available to early birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers responded to these deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Packer, who said she had not shopped on the day after Christmas in 20 
years, was one of nearly 50 people gathered for the 8 a.m. opening of the 
Broadway in the Beverly Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here early because of the coupon," Packer said, pulling a clipped 
certificate offering an extra 10% discount to those buying before 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom and Tori Venturi of Los Angeles, also arriving early at the Broadway, said 
they had purchased gifts for their children but had put off shopping for each 
other until after Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We waited because you get more bang for your buck today," Tom said. "We're 
here early and should be able to get in and out in about an hour." 
</P>
<P>
 "Make that two hours," Tori said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Fox Hills Mall in Culver City, the CardAmerica card and gift shop opened 
about half an hour early at the insistence of a line of customers, said store 
manager Kim Wiley. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'Let us in. We have money to spend,' " Wiley said. 
</P>
<P>
 And upstairs -- at King's Hallmark card shop -- about 50 people buzzed outside 
until the store lifted the gates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unbelievable!" shouted Denise Williams, taking photographs of the crowd as 
they rushed into the small shop. Williams, in a training program for Hallmark 
store ownership, said the crowd was responding to discounts of 50% on cards, 
gift items and chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura and Gary Wolfe of Irvine gave up on shopping after spending two hours 
being jostled by bargain-hunters while trying to buy shoes at Nordstrom in 
Costa Mesa's South Coast Plaza. Salesclerks handed out numbers to customers who 
wanted to be served. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found out we were 298th," Gary Wolfe said. "I tried to bribe a clerk to 
wait on us, but he wouldn't take it. So we gave up. I figured it would take 
half my life, that my feet would grow before I got to try anything on." 
</P>
<P>
 At Topanga Plaza in Canoga Park, dozens of holiday shoppers had lined up in 
front of department stores by 7:30 a.m. By midday, every one of the mall's 
5,400 parking spaces was taken. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buy, buy, buy! That's what we're here for," said Anastasia Hendrix, who stood 
in a long line at the Gap, holding a striped turtleneck. "I don't do any 
shopping the day before Christmas. There's no incentive." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the largest incentives were offered by department stores, which opened 
one to two hours earlier than usual. All the major chains -- Bullock's, 
Robinsons-May, Broadway and Nordstrom among them -- offered up to 50% off on 
many items. 
</P>
<P>
 I. Magnin entered the beginning of its final post-Christmas sale period by 
offering 70% off on dresses. R. H. Macy & Co., operator of Bullock's and I. 
Magnin, last month announced that would close the 12-store I. Magnin chain by 
early January. On Sunday, the company said that three I. Magnins -- in 
Pasadena, Palm Desert and Palos Verdes -- would close permanently at 6 p.m. 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the I. Magnin stores will be converted to Bullock's or Macy's. Saks 
Fifth Avenue will acquire four of the remaining seven stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Retailers that traditionally cut prices in December -- among them sporting 
goods and consumer electronics chains -- were also offering their lowest prices 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the largest price cuts were found at specialty apparel stores and in 
clothing sections of department stores because garment sales continue to suffer 
from a three-year slump nationwide. Even with the lure of lower prices, many 
consumers have showed little interest in clothing during the season. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Diego, Cindy Young browsed through a Limited clothing store, but made 
no purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't buy a lot of clothes this year, just a lot of household goods," she 
said. "We bought bunk beds for the grandkids and a set of pots and pans for my 
mother-in-law, just practical things that they'll have for a long time, instead 
of clothes and things they don't need." 
</P>
<P>
 Dayton Hudson Corp. -- operator of the Mervyn's and Target chains -- said 
clothing sales were slow Monday. Clothing traditionally accounts for about 80% 
of Mervyn's sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nationally, women's wear has been particularly weak," said Walter Loeb, a New 
York-based retail analyst. "There has been no fashion breakthroughs and no 
excitement." 
</P>
<P>
 This winter's warmer weather was partly to blame nationwide, lessening demand 
for sweaters and other heavy clothing. Apparel sales have been a bit stronger 
in Southern California -- where weather is less of a factor in sales -- and 
local retailers should have less clothing in clearance inventories, Deloitte & 
Touche's Giss said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that sellers of consumer electronics -- items such as cellular 
telephones and fax machines -- were among the Southland merchants with the 
strongest holiday sales season. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, jewelry -- with a 10.1% increase -- had the biggest sales gain of 
the season from Thanksgiving weekend through Christmas Eve, according to a 
report released Monday by the International Council of Shopping Centers, a 
trade group representing most of the nation's malls. Of the seven categories 
surveyed, apparel had the season's smallest increase -- only 1.4%, the council 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the council's survey showed a 3.2% increase in sales for the season 
nationally. However, that tally only includes shopping centers and does not 
cover department stores or major discount chains such as Wal-Mart. 
</P>
<P>
 Other surveys show that consumers were increasingly value-conscious and 
dependent on credit. TeleCheck, a check acceptance service, reported that the 
dollar amount of purchases made with checks rose only 2.2% percent for Nov. 25 
through Dec. 21 over the same period last year. However, MasterCard said sales 
authorizations from Thanksgiving weekend through Christmas Eve climbed to 
$17.38 billion, a 35.2% jump from last year. 
</P>
<P>
 MasterCard's Smart Money Watch, a survey that also includes transactions 
involving the American Express, Visa and Discover cards, reported that discount 
stores registered the largest increases in credit card sales this holiday 
season -- up 63%. That huge gain was due in part to one additional sales day 
this season.

REGULATORS SHIFT FOCUS TO TINY AIR POLLUTANTS

 It sounds like a recipe for some sort of noxious stew: Take soot from trucks 
and buses, add a bit of ammonia from dairy farms, mix in nitrates from car 
exhaust, a hefty dose of dust and dirt that blow off streets and construction 
sites, a sprinkling of ash from fires, some sulfur from factories and a final 
dash of sea salts. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined, this brew can clog the filters at an air-quality monitoring station 
in Rubidoux, on the outskirts of Riverside, within a span of hours, rendering 
them opaque with fine black particles that also can lodge in the lungs of 
people who live there. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, most recently on a dismal day in January, the mass of airborne 
particles that shrouds the Rubidoux area reaches three to four times greater 
than a health standard set by state authorities. While the Inland Empire 
suffers the most severe and frequent bouts, unhealthful amounts of these 
particles occur year-round throughout the four-county Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning next year, the Southland's air quality agency will embark on a new 
frontier as it launches a decade-long quest to control this pervasive and 
mysterious pollutant known as PM 10 -- particulate matter smaller than 10 
microns, one-fifth the width of a human hair. 
</P>
<P>
 After decades of obsessing on ozone, the Los Angeles region's most notorious 
air pollutant, the South Coast Air Quality Management District and the 
California Air Resources Board are shifting their focus toward designing a 
strategy by 1997 to clean up these microscopic particles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the next three or four years, I fully expect we'll see a shift in 
emphasis in California," said Mike Scheible, the state board's deputy executive 
officer. "PM 10 will become the air pollution topic for the end of this century 
and the beginning of the next century. It is an especially dangerous air 
pollutant." 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal law, the Los Angeles Basin -- which is twice as polluted with 
particulates as most areas in the nation -- has until Feb. 8, 1997, to detail 
how it intends to achieve national PM 10 health standards by 2006. 
</P>
<P>
 Health researchers have called the ultra-fine particles California's deadliest 
air pollutant because they can escape the body's defense mechanisms and 
penetrate deep into the lungs. PM 10 has been linked in recent scientific 
studies to chronic respiratory disease and premature deaths from heart attacks, 
pneumonia, asthma and other ailments. A gritty fog of PM 10 sometimes reduces 
visibility to a few blocks around Ontario and Riverside and to a mile in 
eastern Los Angeles and northern Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Particulates have taken a back seat to ozone control in a lot of areas," said 
Ron White, environmental health director at the American Lung Assn. "But the 
health data that has emerged in the past two years has been a real wake-up 
call. Unfortunately, a lot of areas in the country -- including the Los Angeles 
Basin, even though it is further ahead than most -- are playing catch-up to 
develop a package of control programs." 
</P>
<P>
 As they chart their new course, state and local air officials face some 
wrenching decisions on how to spread the cleanup burden, which will probably 
cost billions of dollars per year, among the various sources of PM 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually every human activity that burns fuel, stirs up dirt or dust, builds 
a structure or tills soil creates a cloud of atmospheric particles. The PM 10 
that obscures the region's skies is a mystifying blend of man-made and natural 
substances, its contents shifting from city to city and season to season. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it is such a grab bag of pollutants, PM 10 poses one of the most 
profound challenges facing the two air agencies. The AQMD, as it tries to hash 
out an equitable cleanup plan, is admittedly reliant on imprecise and 
unsophisticated data on the degree of blame to assign each source. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some tough questions ahead of us and so many unknowns about the 
composition of PM 10," said Norton Younglove, who recently retired as a 
Riverside County supervisor and AQMD board member and will chair a PM 10 
working group representing the various industries, municipalities and 
regulators. "Depending on how the data shakes out, we may have to kick at each 
other a bit." 
</P>
<P>
 The planning process got off to a contentious start in August when Los Angeles 
Mayor Richard Riordan proposed a major change in the AQMD's 20-year anti-smog 
plan that pitted the cities near the coast against the region's more inland 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor suggested that it may be more cost-effective for the air district to 
target particles from outlying dirt roads and dairy farms than to mandate 
alternative fuels for urban trucks, trains, ships and other diesel equipment. 
Citing possible economic disruption, he asked the AQMD to remove the proposals 
aimed at particulates from its plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Inland Empire officials reacted angrily, accusing Los Angeles of trying 
to shift the PM 10 burden to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the state and local air boards trying to solve the PM 10 problem are 
wrestling with the very question posed by Riordan and his staff: Should they 
assign the highest priority to "fugitive dust" -- particles of earth from 
roads, construction sites and fields -- or to exhaust from motor vehicles? That 
debate, in essence, pits Chino's farms against Los Angeles' trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easier for those upwind to ignore this (PM 10) problem, but we can't 
help but take it more personally here because we are impacted the most," said 
Younglove, a longtime Riverside County resident. "Politically, it is 
unquestionably easier to pick on cows -- which are phasing out anyway -- and 
rural roads than ships, planes and trains, which are large, important parts of 
our economy." 
</P>
<P>
 About 115 million people in the United States, including one-third of 
California's population, live in areas where the air violates federal PM 10 
health standards set in 1987, according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
data. The record is far worse for a more stringent state health standard; just 
one area of California, Lake County, east of Mendocino, complies. However, only 
the severely polluted areas in California, those that violate the federal 
standard, face the 1997 deadline for devising a cleanup plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Angeles Basin, violations of the PM 10 health standards occur under 
an enormous variety of weather conditions, from stagnant summer days to gusty 
fall winds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, the only time of year that we are free of higher levels of PM 10 is 
during the rainy season -- most of January, March and the beginning of April," 
said AQMD senior meteorologist Joe Cassmassi. 
</P>
<P>
 As dismal as the record is, research over the past year indicates that the 
national standard may be too lax to protect public health. In a study of 8,000 
people in six cities, the Harvard School of Public Health reported last year 
that PM 10 increases the risk of early death 26% and shortens lives one to two 
years in moderately polluted cities -- such as Steubenville, Ohio -- which 
already comply with the federal standard. Other research shows that respiratory 
deaths increase 3.4% and asthma attacks increase 3% for every small increase 
(10 micrograms) in PM 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, of all the major air pollutants, particulates remain the most poorly 
understood. 
</P>
<P>
 Even basic assumptions -- what is it comprised of and which are the biggest 
sources -- are based on imperfect and outdated databases and models. AQMD 
measurements that define its composition are almost a decade old. 
</P>
<P>
 To resolve some of these uncertainties, the AQMD board recently authorized 
$600,000 for a 1 1/2-year research project to decipher the chemical makeup of 
the smallest, most hazardous particles and the role of motor vehicles and 
ammonia. The agency also is seeking $1.5 million in research funds from other 
groups, including the city of Los Angeles and the oil, auto, construction and 
dairy industries. 
</P>
<P>
 PM 10 remains such an enigma because it is the only major pollutant that is 
not identified by its chemical contents. Instead, it is crudely defined purely 
by its size. An airborne particle of anything trapped in a 10-micron filter -- 
mineral, metal, soot, soil or synthetic material -- qualifies as the pollutant. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Palm Springs, which suffers major dust storms, the vast majority of PM 
10 in the Los Angeles Basin comes from man-made sources, with only a slight 
fraction coming from minerals blowing from the land or ocean, said John Watson, 
a research professor at the University of Nevada-Reno's Desert Research 
Institute who studies particulates throughout the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day in the basin, about 850 tons of particulates under 10 microns pollute 
the air from streets, farms, trucks, buses, cars, oil refineries, mines and 
other sources, according to an AQMD inventory. Also, about 1,000 tons per day 
of nitrogen oxides, mostly from motor vehicles, and 200 tons of sulfur from 
industrial plants can react in the atmosphere to indirectly create 
particulates. 
</P>
<P>
 About one-third of the basin's PM 10 is ammonium nitrate, a blend of nitrogen 
from vehicles and ammonia released in the air largely from dairy farms. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a very complex pollutant," said White of the lung association. "Not 
only do you have to worry about direct emissions, but also the secondary 
sources (from) gases, typically from industrial sources and cars, that get 
transformed in the atmosphere into particles." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most challenging mysteries is the source and volume of dust that 
blows from roads and fields. On some nights in Riverside, calcium particles 
cause dramatic peaks in PM 10, but no one knows where they come from. Watson 
believes that some type of human activity is stirring up calcium-rich soils. 
</P>
<P>
 "The data on fugitive dust are very, very inaccurate and probably 
overestimated," Watson said. "It's very difficult to trace it back to their 
sources." 
</P>
<P>
 By volume, the single largest culprit is dust and dirt stirred up on paved 
roads, which are responsible for 450 tons per day of PM 10. But the tinier the 
particle, the more serious the health threat, so the AQMD and state board are 
likely to focus their regulations on particles measuring under 2.5 microns, 
which come predominantly from trucks and cars, rather than the larger particles 
blowing off dirty roads. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the sources of PM 10 presents an easy or cheap solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Controlling dust from roads and fields could require more thorough and 
frequent street sweeping, enclosures for manure and other waste piles, wind 
screens, planting of vegetation and slowing of traffic through dusty areas. 
Eliminating substantial amounts of particles from trucks, buses and other 
diesel-powered vehicles means switching to alternative fuels such as natural 
gas and methanol. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Los Angeles, the easy stuff has already been done," Watson said. "You 
can't just nail some power plant. You've already cranked down as far as you can 
on many of these sources." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the state may have no choice but to focus on motor vehicles because the 
federal Environmental Protection Agency is leaning toward imposing a new 
standard for tinier particles. The agency is under court order to review its PM 
10 standards by Jan. 31, 1997 -- eight days before local cleanup plans are due. 
</P>
<P>
 Trucking companies vehemently oppose standards that would end use of diesel -- 
which is a cheap and efficient, but dirty, fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's diesel trucks contain particulate-trapping filters mandated by state 
emission standards. Compared to trucks manufactured in 1970, 1994 trucks are 
80% to 90% cleaner in particulates and 65% to 70% cleaner in nitrogen oxides. 
</P>
<P>
 "Diesel technology has already come a long ways," said John Fischer of Detroit 
Diesel, a major manufacturer of truck and bus engines. 
</P>
<P>
 In its ozone cleanup plan adopted last month, the state ARB proposed a 
standard that by 2002 would cut in half nitrogen oxides from new 
California-based heavy-duty trucks. The state plan also lists a future option 
of halving the limit again after 2004 -- which would require new catalytic 
technology or switching to an alternative fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie Williams, a California Trucking Assn. vice president, said fuels 
such as natural gas might be an option for short hauls within the region, but 
not trips longer than 250 miles, in which heavy-duty trucks must climb mountain 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately," Fischer said, "with any alternative fuel, you lose one of the 
major advantages you have with diesel -- its fuel efficiency." 
</P>
<P>
 Ammonia is also a mystery, although most fingers point to piles of cow manure 
at Chino's dairy farms. Dairy farmers, struggling with water quality 
regulations and dropping profits, worry that tough new PM 10 rules will target 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Broadbent, the AQMD's planning director, said the lack of understanding 
about the role of each type of particle poses a "significant impediment" as his 
agency plans its attack on the pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 "There needs to be a great deal of work in reducing the great number of 
uncertainties," he said. "We have a very open mind (about control techniques) 
at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet air quality officials do not have much time to seek the answers before the 
1997 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big question of concern," Younglove said, "is whether we can collect this 
data quick enough to meet federal deadlines." 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of politically influential opposition, White said the AQMD and 
state air board need political will if the Los Angeles region is to meet its 
mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the promises are kept, I think 2006 is achievable," he said. "But it's a 
question of whether those commitments will be met and maintained." 
</P>

 On an average day, more than 800 tons of PM 10 -- particles less than 10 
microns in size -- are emitted into the air of the four-county Los Angeles 
Basin. The following list shows the amounts from direct sources of particles; 
abundant gases such as nitrogen, ammonia and sulfur which indirectly form

 SHIFTING THE BLAME 
</P>
<P>
 The source of PM 10 varies from place to place, prompting a battle among 
cities and industries over what should be regulated. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Riverside County area of Rubidoux, which suffers the most severe PM 10 
pollution, a large percentage comes from road dust and dairy farms. 
</P>
<P>
 Downtown Los Angeles, however, gets more from motor vehicles. The smallest and 
most dangerous particles, under 2.5 microns in size, nearly all come from 
trucks, cars and industries that burn fuel. 
</P>

 Microscopic particles in the sky that obscure visibility and lodge in the

the average concentration of PM 10 particles -- so named because they are less 
than 10 microns in size -- in areas of the South Coast air basin for 1992. 
Areas with an annual average of more than 50 micrograms of PM 10 per cubic 
meter of air violate federal standards. The state deems more than 30 micrograms

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; WASHINGTON RESPONDS TEPIDLY TO THE TUMULT; 
POLITICS: NEITHER DEMOCRATS NOR REPUBLICANS SEEM INCLINED TOWARD LEGISLATIVE 
REMEDIES. THE REASON LIES PARTLY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE, AND IN THE 
COUNTY'S REPUTATION FOR FREE ENTERPRISE AND ANTI-TAX FERVOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It may be the biggest municipal bankruptcy case in the country's history, but 
Orange County's stunning financial fall is prompting a curiously tepid response 
in the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally a nerve center of action and reaction in the aftermath of an 
emergency involving public assets, official Washington is instead strangely 
ambivalent over the proper posture on Orange County's fiscal tumult and whether 
there is anything the federal government should do about it. 
</P>
<P>
 The contrast to the government's usual instinct is striking. From New York 
City's fiscal meltdown in 1975 to the savings and loan crisis to individual 
bank failures and plunges in the stock market, national political leaders have 
responded with a predictable explosion of declarations of concern, pleas for 
federal intervention and plans to address shortcomings with new regulations and 
tighter government oversight. 
</P>
<P>
 But in this case, the beleaguered Clinton Administration has shown little 
inclination to offer help to affluent Orange County and the incoming Congress 
shows little appetite for legislative remedies when it convenes next month. 
This is due in part to some unique factors in the Orange County affair, as well 
as the county's reputation as a bastion of free enterprise and anti-tax fervor. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is also a sign of changed times. With talk of sweeping federal budget 
cuts and with ascendant conservatives in Congress vowing to roll back 
regulations and get the government out of people's lives, the climate is 
notably hostile to any rescue effort or regulatory crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "The overall fiscal picture of the federal government ensures that no one in 
Washington is going to have any interest in easing Orange County's financial 
burdens," said Thomas E. Mann, director of governmental studies at the 
Brookings Institution. "It is also the case that Orange County has the 
reputation of being one of the wealthiest counties in the country and 
therefore, if anyone can cope with a loss of this sort, it's them." 
</P>
<P>
 Roger H. Davidson, a political scientist at the University of Maryland, put it 
a little differently. As far as Washington is concerned, he said, "it's been 
like a tree falling in the forest without any ears around to hear it." 
</P>
<P>
 To some extent, the relative quietude has been a matter of timing. The Orange 
County calamity broke in the wake of midterm elections that sent Democrats 
sprawling and Republicans scrambling to grab control of the congressional reins 
for the first time since the Eisenhower era. Not only was Congress not in 
session, but the transfer of power has created a sense of flux. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, the incoming Republicans have announced plans to hold two 
hearings in January on the subjects of volatile derivative investments and the 
oversight of municipal securities -- issues highlighted by Orange County's 
collapse. The county suffered losses estimated to exceed $2 billion as a result 
of heavy borrowing and investments in high-risk derivatives, complex financial 
instruments that derive their value from the performance of an underlying 
security, interest rate or market index. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, incoming House Banking Committee Chairman James A. Leach (R-Iowa), a 
moderate who does not echo the prevailing conservative approach in his interest 
in possible regulatory redress, also plans to hold a hearing on Orange County. 
But any legislation that he or others propose is likely to run into opposition 
from powerful Republican colleagues as well as the politically influential 
securities industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration insists that it has done everything that it could. 
To this point, that has largely amounted to convening a special markets working 
group, which was established after the 1987 stock market crash to survey the 
situation. The group's answer: caution other localities to invest prudently. 
</P>
<P>
 "The federal government has no direct legal authority over the investments of 
local government," said a senior official at the Treasury Department, which 
heads the group. "Those are controlled by state statutes and local ordinances." 
</P>
<P>
 The official, who spoke on the condition that she not be named, said Orange 
County's economic and political status as a Republican stronghold has nothing 
to do with the Administration's passive position on a situation that is 
expected to force hundreds of layoffs and deep local spending cuts and 
jeopardize projects such as the construction of schools and courthouses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ultimately, Orange County is going to figure out how it will get out of this 
situation, just like New York City or Bridgeport, Conn., or San Jose" did when 
those cities were embroiled in a financial crisis, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 In this respect, the Administration has an unlikely ally: Orange County's 
congressional delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the federal government can do anything to help them out," said 
Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside). "I am convinced they can work themselves 
through it. I don't think they should have any special dispensation." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) was characteristically blunter: "That's 
not on our watch. That's the (county) supervisors' battle." 
</P>
<P>
 To the extent that Congress can help Orange County recover, said Rep. 
Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), it will do so by lifting cumbersome federal 
mandates on counties. "That's the kind of solution you will get," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Governors and mayors, particularly Republicans, have long demanded that the 
federal government desist from handing down costly "unfunded mandates." In time 
of need, this kind of stand for greater autonomy also makes it harder to ask 
for federal assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Democrats, who tend to be more receptive to bailouts and regulatory 
redress, look on Orange County as the gilded heartland of the right wing, a 
place that gave the country Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan and an airport 
named after John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 "The free-market philosophy comes with pluses and minuses and one of the 
minuses is that sometimes you stumble," said Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), a 
member of the House Banking Committee. "They made a conscious decision to 
gamble so I don't think we should bail them out. It was quite irresponsible to 
have done this with borrowed money. They should deal with the consequences of 
their actions." 
</P>
<P>
 A liberal activist was even less charitable. The Orange County bankruptcy "is 
like a fire sale at Gucci's," said Colleen O'Connor, deputy director of the 
Campaign for New Priorities, which advocates shifting money from defense 
spending to urban programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Republicans, Leach has been unusually outspoken in calling for 
regulatory reform in the wake of the Orange County situation. At a news 
conference this month, he said that he intended to introduce legislation that 
would require municipal securities to operate under the same disclosure 
requirements as corporate issuers. Cox has called for similar legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my judgment, in a democracy, municipalities ought to lead the way in full 
disclosure," Leach said. "It is perverse to think that public officials should 
be held to a lower disclosure criteria than private corporations." 
</P>
<P>
 This would require more than 55,000 public bodies that issue bonds to submit 
periodic certified reports that meet rigorous accounting standards to the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. State investment issues now fall under the 
jurisdiction of the states and not the SEC, with the exception of potential 
violations of the anti-fraud provisions of securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents, including the securities industry and state and local government 
representatives, say that such a requirement would entail substantial costs to 
pay for auditors and lawyers to prepare the reports, would subject local 
governments to expanded liability and would constitute a new federal mandate. A 
GOP aide on the House Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the 
securities industry, said that most Republicans on the panel would oppose such 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 SEC Commissioner Richard Roberts said that such legislation is not necessary 
because the commission has approved new reporting requirements in the past year 
"that should be completed and implemented before any new projects are started." 
</P>
<P>
 These rules would bar broker-dealers from underwriting bonds as of July 3, 
unless they verify that the issuer has agreed to disclosure of annual financial 
information and material events that could affect their bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach has also vowed to reintroduce legislation to strengthen regulations 
governing the investment of derivatives, which he has called "the new wild card 
in international finance." 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, one of the most remarkable aspects of (Orange County) is that there is 
no accountability here in Washington because no accountability has been 
decisively and thoughtfully placed," Leach said. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and other federal 
financial regulators have said that they view derivatives as a valuable way to 
balance risk in today's rapidly changing financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Phillips, a conservative commentator, said the Administration and 
Congress have been so remiss in failing to address the dangers of derivatives 
that they are "either collaborators or guilty of regulatory omission." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that key Administration officials came from Wall Street firms that 
reap large profits from derivative trading and that securities brokers had 
showered the major political parties and lawmakers with campaign funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the broader regulatory implications, some said that Washington's lack 
of angst over Orange County's situation is widely shared throughout the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 William Schneider, a political analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, 
sees parallels with New York's fiscal crisis, when the nation's largest city 
narrowly averted bankruptcy. Many conservatives then believed that the city's 
plight was well-deserved. 
</P>
<P>
 "As Orange County is the symbol of excessive conservatism and freewheeling 
capitalism, New York was regarded as the symbol of excessive liberalism and the 
corruption of the welfare state," Schneider said. "If there was more concern 
about New York -- and there wasn't a lot of it -- it was because New York was 
the financial capital of the country."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; NO HONEYMOON LIKELY IN BERGESON'S HOMECOMING; 
POLITICS: STATE SENATOR'S DEREGULATION BILLS HAUNT HER AS SHE MAKES TRANSITION 
TO ORANGE COUNTY SUPERVISOR. SOME SAY SHE HELPED PAVE WAY FOR CRISIS.

<P>
 These are her last days in the state Legislature, but it's no swan song. 
Instead, Sen. Marian Bergeson is doing a swan dive straight into Orange 
County's stormy political surf. 
</P>
<P>
 As the county grapples with its devastating bankruptcy and investment crisis, 
Bergeson will be assuming a seat on the Board of Supervisors after the New 
Year. For perhaps the first time in her long career as a public servant, she 
will be carting along some cumbersome political baggage. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, critics have pointed out that Bergeson carried several bills 
that were among a string of state measures approved in recent years to 
deregulate the public investment process, paving the way for Orange County's 
troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 They have also criticized Bergeson's decision in May to "unendorse" John M. W. 
Moorlach, the Republican financial planner and certified public accountant who 
raised questions about Orange County's investment practices during his election 
campaign against county Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron, who resigned 
Dec. 5 after the investment debacle surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Orange County's increasingly angry electorate, even Bergeson -- who has 
long enjoyed a Teflon reputation -- could face some testy days ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she had anything to do with this, she should not take office," said Carole 
Walters, president of the Orange Taxpayers Assn. and one of several residents 
fomenting a recall effort against the current supervisors. "I think anyone who 
is behind these bills should step down. They have ripped the taxpayers off." 
</P>
<P>
 But many others, particularly those who have worked with Bergeson, say the 
veteran lawmaker is part of the solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't think Marian deserves to shoulder a lot of the blame," said 
Eileen Padberg, an Orange County political consultant. "Her reputation as a 
legislator who can get things done will override any of the baggage." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, whose 5th District seat Bergeson will assume 
Monday, said Bergeson "doesn't deserve any blame in this" and he will "say a 
prayer for her" as she embarks into the stormy days ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson, 69, acknowledges that she faces the toughest test of her political 
career, both in helping the county recover and overcoming the growing public 
anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of outrage out there and a lot of hurt and it's not going to 
get better right away," she said. "It's going to take time. I'm only concerned 
about establishing sufficient credibility and helping to work things through. I 
think you gain the trust of the public through your actions." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bergeson will have to overcome the skepticism of disgruntled Orange County 
residents who blame the veteran legislator and other Sacramento lawmakers for 
loosening the leash on county treasurers such as Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson sponsored at least three bills dealing with local investment 
authority, including one that permitted local governments to invest in 
lower-grade, A-rated securities rather than safer AAA-rated offerings. She also 
served as chairwoman of the Senate Local Government Committee, which reviewed 
and approved many of the deregulation bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The measures were fueled by a belief that local governments needed more tools 
to finance services in the aftermath of tax-cutting Proposition 13, Bergeson 
said. She suggested that the laws giving county treasurers greater autonomy did 
not cause Orange County's problem -- that the trouble was public officials who 
stretched the laws to the limit. 
</P>
<P>
 That is a view shared by many investment bankers, including one who was 
disappointed when Bergeson withdrew her support of Moorlach. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's really nothing wrong with the flexibility added to the investment 
standards," said Chriss W. Street, an investment banker and Moorlach supporter. 
"Cars aren't inherently dangerous, but dangerous drivers are always dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some critics of the Legislature's efforts to deregulate public finance do 
not lay much blame on Bergeson. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Alexander, executive director of the nonprofit California Voter 
Foundation, characterized Bergeson as "more a victim of the conditions of the 
legislative process than a culprit." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander said the real problem lies in the inability of lawmakers and their 
overburdened staffs to regularly perform any sort of concise review of the 
proliferating maze of complex legislation that rolls through the Capitol each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some county politicians remain mildly ruffled over Bergeson's treatment of 
Moorlach during his quest to unseat Citron. Bergeson said she withdrew her 
endorsement because the race for the nonpartisan treasurer's seat had become 
politicized and she worried that Moorlach's criticisms of Citron's investment 
strategy could damage the county's credit rating on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Insiders say Bergeson "agonized" over pulling her endorsement, and in recent 
days she has made no secret that she would probably support Moorlach's 
appointment as county treasurer in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everybody was kind of asleep at the switch," Bergeson said. "When 
John's warnings were sounded there should have been immediate attention by 
those who had authority to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorlach has not held a grudge, but he says it was painful when Bergeson 
pulled her support. "I won't say it cost me the race, but it sure had an 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told her that when this thing hits the fan, she was going to find herself 
on the wrong side of the leadership curve," Moorlach said. "Now it has hit. 
Whether it has muddied her, I can't really say." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Moorlach added, "just because she made a tragic error in judgment on 
my campaign, I don't see that as being a big enough reason to believe she won't 
do a good job."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; UNION SEEKS MEETING ON REINSTATING CONTRACTS; 
LABOR: ORANGE COUNTY'S LARGEST EMPLOYEE GROUP ALSO WILL ASK THAT LAYOFFS BE 
USED AS LAST RESORT. DECISIONS FOLLOW BUDGET-CUTTING ACTIONS BY THE BOARD OF 
SUPERVISORS.

 In its second emergency meeting over the holiday weekend, Orange County's 
largest employee union voted Monday to ask the county for a formal meeting to 
discuss reinstating its labor contracts, and to appeal to department managers 
individually to use layoffs only as a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 Still reeling from Thursday's announcement that the county would immediately 
reduce its budget by $40.2 million and might lay off hundreds of workers, the 
leadership of the Orange County Employees Assn. decided Christmas Day to 
authorize legal action against the county. Though the 19-member board met again 
Monday, it still had not decided whether a lawsuit or administrative appeals 
would work best. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a profound sense of betrayal here," said John Sawyer Jr., an 
attorney for the union, which represents 16 collective bargaining units. 
</P>
<P>
 John H. Sawyer Sr., general manager of the union, which represents 11,000 of 
the county's 18,000 workers, said a decision on legal action will probably come 
next week. Union leaders are angry that the County Board of Supervisors 
suspended collective bargaining agreements Thursday and gave county managers 
broad discretion over whom it can fire, regardless of a worker's seniority. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the union will seek "meet-and-confer" sessions with the county's 
human resources department as early as Wednesday in hopes of renewing the 
collective bargaining agreements that the board voided as part of its 
budget-slashing plan, officials said. Supervisors said the bankruptcy filing 
gave the board the authority to set aside the labor contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor William G. Steiner said the county was under extraordinary 
pressure to reduce spending immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was an urgency," he said. "We spend $7 million a week in salaries. By 
the time we had the process for meeting and conferring, talking about those who 
had seniority and who might be laid off, the whole thing could have lasted 
until May." 
</P>
<P>
 Union representatives also will seek meetings with every department manager in 
the next two weeks to suggest job sharing, early retirement and leaves of 
absence as options. Department heads were told Thursday how much they needed to 
cut, but they have until Jan. 10 to decide how to meet the goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Union representatives said they were never given warning that the county 
intended to slash millions from the budget this year and suspend the labor 
contracts, even the night before the board approved the action. 
</P>
<P>
 As late as Wednesday night, the management council of Sheriff Brad Gates, 
Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi and Health Care Agency Director Tom Uram had 
assured labor officials that despite the financial crisis, "they were not going 
to make cuts on the backs of the employees or take from the pockets of the 
employees, because it was not the employees' fault," attorney Sawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Sawyers say the county has never done a good job of explaining how an 
estimated $2.02-billion loss in Orange County's investment fund -- which 
contains the savings of 187 school districts, cities and other public entities 
-- translates into the need for $40.2 million in savings in the next six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials have said that nearly $30 million of that amount will come 
from slicing budgets in dozens of departments. The other $10 million will come 
from cash advances from federal, state and local sources.

5.3 QUAKE HITS EUREKA AREA; TEMBLOR: DAMAGE IS CONSIDERABLE IN SEVERAL HUMBOLDT 
COUNTY TOWNS. MOST INJURIES ARE MINOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A magnitude 5.3 earthquake struck before dawn Monday near Eureka, causing 
about 25 minor injuries, littering the downtown area with glass and producing 
considerable damage in several communities in Northern California's Humboldt 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency authorities said seven homes were red-tagged as unsafe and their 
occupants were moved to shelters after the 6:10 a.m. temblor, which occurred 11 
miles beneath the surface on the Gorda tectonic plate, 12 miles southwest of 
Eureka. 
</P>
<P>
 California's North Coast -- where three plates floating on the Earth's mantle 
intersect -- has been shaken repeatedly in the last 15 years, with four quakes 
measuring at least magnitude 7. But all of these have been off the coast and at 
a greater distance from Eureka. 
</P>
<P>
 "A quake closer to home seems stronger," said Lori Dengler, a Humboldt State 
University seismologist. "And this one struck with a large closing jolt, and a 
lot of people say they saw flashing lights, not an uncommon phenomenon in some 
earthquakes." 
</P>
<P>
 "It hit really hard," said Eureka resident Jean Gordon. "We were still in bed 
asleep and it woke us. It broke a few things in the house. We had shelves come 
down, but there was no damage to anything that was important." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon said she and her husband later drove through the city of 25,000 on the 
overcast and drizzly day and saw "quite a few big bay windows shattered and 
some evidence of landslides." 
</P>
<P>
 "It created a total mess," Jonathan Webb said of his neighborhood. "I can hear 
people hammering and pounding and putting things back together." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Fallan, a spokesman for the Humboldt County Office of Emergency Services, 
said that the county courthouse, which had been undergoing retrofitting, was 
damaged and that three towns -- Arcata, Fortuna and McKinleyville -- had some 
damage. Chimneys fell at several homes in and outside Eureka, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three hospitals told Eureka police that injured people, a few with fractured 
limbs, came to their emergency rooms for treatment. At St. Joseph's Hospital, 
emergency generators were used for an hour when power failed, and even hours 
later, the facility's computer system remained out, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Walser, a Eureka city spokesman, said that aside from the injuries, a gas 
line rupture caused the most trouble. The street had to be ripped up by workers 
seeking to locate the leak, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fallen merchandise caused two major stores in the city's malls to close for 
cleanup on the first shopping day after Christmas, Walser said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's fishing pier appeared to sustain "a very minor movement away from 
the shoreline," he said, and there was a broken waterline at the pier. But the 
public was still being allowed on the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Dirt and mudslides on U.S. 101 did not interrupt traffic and scattered power 
outages were cleared up quickly, Walser said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said one man was arrested on suspicion of looting after he was found with 
merchandise from a store whose window had been shattered. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake was felt as far away as Grants Pass, Ore. Allan Lindh, a 
scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey at Menlo Park, Calif., called the 
quake unusual because it was on the tectonic plate itself rather than on one of 
the plate boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not too many quakes have been felt at this particular location," Lindh said. 
"But it's part of a pattern of increasing activity in the Gorda plate north of 
the Triple Junction," where the Gorda, North American and Pacific plates come 
together and California's greatest fault, the San Andreas, first comes ashore 
from the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992 and on Sept. 1 of this year, major temblors, measuring magnitude 7.1 
and 7.2, occurred near the Triple Junction and were related to subduction 
zones, where the leading edge of one plate is slowly submerging and burrowing 
under another. But Monday's was not a subduction zone quake, Lindh said.

U.S. OFFICIAL DISPATCHED TO N. KOREA TO SEEK PILOT'S RELEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Responding to an opening from the Pyongyang regime, the Clinton Administration 
sent a high-ranking diplomat to North Korea on Monday to try to secure the 
release of a U.S. pilot downed there 10 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Hubbard, deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific 
affairs, left here Monday and is scheduled to cross the demilitarized zone into 
North Korea on Wednesday, officials here said. 
</P>
<P>
 His goal is to return with Army Chief Warrant Officer Bobby Hall, whose 
helicopter strayed into North Korean airspace Dec. 17 and was shot down. Last 
week, the remains of his co-pilot, Chief Warrant Officer David Hilemon, were 
turned over to U.S. authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea, in a dispatch by the official Korean Central News Agency 
monitored today in Tokyo, charged that the intrusion was "a deliberate act of 
espionage." 
</P>
<P>
 North Korean soldiers "sent warning signals twice . . . but the helicopter 
continued flying northward along a ravine," the agency said. "The helicopter 
was hit by one shot and fell aflame into a ravine. . . . The intrusion . . . 
has turned out not to be an 'accidental case' caused by a 'mistake' in a mere 
training flight." 
</P>
<P>
 The dispatch charged that "bellicose quarters of the United States are 
attempting to resolve the problem through pressure while trying to conceal the 
truth of the incident." If Washington wants "a smooth solution," the agency 
declared, "it must admit its responsibility as the offender and clearly show an 
honest and reasonable attitude before it is too late." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials have insisted the crew was not on an intelligence mission. They 
have suggested that the helicopter strayed into North Korean airspace because 
its crew was disoriented by heavy snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbard was dispatched to North Korea after the government there wrote to the 
United Nations asking for the Americans to send a representative to Pyongyang 
to discuss Hall's repatriation. Administration officials, their hopes already 
dashed for the downed aviator's release by Christmas Day, reacted quickly, 
sending a recognized Korean expert. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Hubbard has been involved in negotiations with this case since the 
beginning," said a State Department official. "He's well-known to the Koreans 
and well-acquainted with issues involving the two countries." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Administration official said the request for a high-level U.S. 
representative to enter the negotiations was a favorable sign. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department officials declined to detail how long Hubbard will remain in 
North Korea or what he might offer there. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rep. Bill Richardson, (D-N.M.), a House Intelligence Committee member who 
was touring North Korean nuclear sites when the U.S. helicopter went down, said 
the talks are stalled because of rifts between North Korean diplomats and 
military leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a lot of gamesmanship going on between the North Korean 
Foreign Ministry that wants to resolve this issue and the North Korean 
military, which is reluctant," he said in an interview here. "So I think the 
North Korean diplomats calling for a U.S. envoy to go there shows that they 
want to resolve this issue and get some leverage over the military."

NEWS ANALYSIS; MEXICO'S ZEDILLO TAKES OFF ON UNEVEN FOOTING; POLITICS: NEW 
PRESIDENT HAD CHARMED THE POPULACE. THEN, IN ONE DISASTROUS WEEK, THE ROOF FELL 
IN. NOW HE FIGHTS TO RECOVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A week ago, President Ernesto Zedillo was on a roll. 
</P>
<P>
 Just 18 days into his six-year term, the 42-year-old Yale-educated economist 
had charmed the opposition into passing a radical judicial reform package by 
overwhelming margins in both houses of Congress. He had won the confidence of 
bankers, business people and brokers through a new budget package that 
projected 4% growth and 4% inflation in 1995. And he had won over the Mexican 
public, less than half of whom had voted for him in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls showed that almost two-thirds of all Mexicans approved of Zedillo's new 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the bottom fell out. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo's roll became a tumble, then an avalanche, of seeming missteps and bad 
luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebels rose up in the southern state of Chiapas. The Mexican stock exchange 
plummeted. Zedillo and his economic team reacted with harsh measures that cut 
the value of the nation's currency by 20% in a day. International and domestic 
economists questioned Zedillo's competence. And finally, a volcano on the 
outskirts of the capital threatened to erupt. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, as Zedillo and his government began the climb back to credibility 
with encouraging new signs of peace in Chiapas, the toll of this one terrible 
week was clear: The president's popular support had been cut almost in half, 
according to one poll; headlines declared, "The Romance Is Over," and Zedillo's 
traumatized nation was deep into what an investigation by the Mexico City 
economic daily El Financiero called "a severe economic and financial crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 In an accompanying editorial on "the virtual collapse suffered by the economy" 
last week, El Financiero disclosed that the government's foreign-exchange 
reserves are insufficient to meet even its most immediate needs; it stressed 
that Zedillo now bears "maximum responsibility" to take the lead in rescuing 
the nation from its many crises. 
</P>
<P>
 But as they took stock after one of Mexico's bleakest Christmases in recent 
memory, analysts here also speculated widely on Zedillo's strategy -- past and 
present -- and the extent of the blame he must bear for last week's crises, 
which he largely inherited from his predecessor, Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of those crises is Chiapas. Analysts agree that Zedillo had few 
options to deal with the rebel Zapatista National Liberation Army when he took 
office. Even before Zedillo's Dec. 1 inauguration, the Zapatistas were 
threatening to break the truce they declared with the Mexican army Jan. 12 
after a two-week shooting war left at least 145 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in power, Zedillo spoke often of his commitment to negotiation, a 
unilateral cease-fire and a solution that would address the Indian rebels' 
demands for equal treatment and authentic democratic reform. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as he did this, Zapatista leader Subcommander Marcos was quietly 
ordering his fighters to slip out of their rain-forest stronghold, through a 
cordon of 40,000 Mexican troops and into dozens of villages and towns in the 
north of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said they were certain that Zedillo's security advisers had told him, 
in advance, that the Zapatistas would stage a major "event" before the 
anniversary of their New Year's Day uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, they said, Zedillo's economic team had determined that 
Salinas had left behind a dangerously overvalued peso, which needed big 
adjustment if Mexico was to remain competitive in international markets. 
</P>
<P>
 In what some then saw as a master stroke, Zedillo combined the two: He 
deliberately waited to move on the peso until after the Zapatistas' Dec. 19 
peaceful insurrection -- a day of commandeering highways and town halls as 
"liberated territory." 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo was prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, he ordered Finance Secretary Jaime Serra Puche to publicly blame 
a "climate of insecurity" spawned by the rebels for the need to widen the 
trading band on the peso, allowing it to slide to four to the dollar from 3.34. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was brilliant. With a single act, he satanized the Zapatistas and 
administered the bitter economic medicine he would have had to apply in any 
case," said one Mexico City political analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Zedillo's next step that few analysts can explain. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 24 hours after allowing the peso to devalue 12%, with a public 
promise to take no further action on the currency, Zedillo's administration 
suddenly announced it would let the peso float. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours, the peso lost a fifth of its value, U.S. investors in Mexico 
lost billions of dollars and some of the most prestigious financial analysts in 
New York declared a "crisis of confidence" in Zedillo and his new, young 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo moved quickly into damage control. 
</P>
<P>
 Having lost the initiative to the Zapatistas, he ordered his most trusted 
aide, Interior Secretary Esteban Moctezuma, to offer Marcos an olive branch 
while ordering the army to prepare a stick. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, as tanks and armored personnel carriers nudged into the 
Zapatistas' jungle zone, Moctezuma announced that the government was relenting 
on one of Marcos' major demands -- allowing a Roman Catholic bishop sympathetic 
to the rebels to help negotiate an end to the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Samuel Ruiz, in the second week of a hunger strike, filled his 
Christmas sermon with joy and hope on Sunday. Within 24 hours, members of his 
ecumenical commission were en route to meet Marcos on the government's behalf 
for the first time in months. 
</P>
<P>
 As they met in the Lacandon rain forest Monday, Zedillo appeared to be having 
better luck with nature, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 50,000 villagers in evacuation centers, scientists said the 
threat of an imminent eruption of the Popocapetl volcano -- an event that could 
shower a city of 20 million with dangerous ash and mud -- appeared to be 
receding. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the imagery of Zedillo's tough, first month in office endured. 
</P>
<P>
 A political cartoon in the daily Jornada on Monday morning showed two peasants 
walking away from the volcano. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least this isn't like the devaluation," one peasant tells the other. "Popo 
warns us in advance."

 No matter that critics call it economically unsound, environmentally damaging 
and a water project with few peers as a blatant example of pork-barrel federal 
largess. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which has touted its new environmental 
sensitivity, is moving ahead with plans to build a dam project known as 
Animas-La Plata, a $687-million reservoir complex near this booming high-desert 
resort community in southern Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Conceived more than 45 years ago as a means of supplying water to the region's 
dry-land farms, this last big project on the bureau's drawing boards will now 
largely support commercial and urban growth in southern Colorado and secure 
rights to water that Native Americans want to use some day for coal extraction 
or to sell to thirsty cities in California and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 But at a time of crushing federal budget deficits, government investigators 
say the cost of building Animas-La Plata outweighs the benefit by a 2-1 ratio, 
and even some federal dam builders say the bulk of the benefit may go to "hobby 
hay farmers" and developers wanting to build subdivisions for "equity exiles" 
from California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call it Jurassic Pork," said Phil Doe, a Bureau of Reclamation 
environmental compliance officer in Denver. "They say it's for the Indians, but 
it's clearly a developer's project, and taxpayers are going to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Howe, a professor of economics at the University of Colorado at 
Boulder, has studied the project for years. He said: "It's a horrible project 
-- ridiculously expensive and blatantly inefficient." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Democratic lawmakers and federal officials had hoped to dramatically 
scale back or even kill the project during congressional committee hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Those hopes may have been dashed, they concede, because the GOP sweep of 
Congress has empowered Republicans in Colorado's congressional delegation, who 
support the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Bureau of Reclamation Director Dan Beard says he has no choice but to 
proceed with what he calls the last major dam complex to be built in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 His reason: a 1988 congressional mandate to restore 130-year-old Native 
American water rights on seven regional rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress ordered construction of the oft-delayed project to settle a legal 
dispute with the Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Ute tribes of southern Colorado. 
If the project is not under construction by the year 2000, the tribes can take 
their case back to federal court. 
</P>
<P>
 If the tribes would prevail in court, which most experts believe is likely, 
some proponents of the project argue that the entire region's water supply 
could come under tribal control, possibly drying up farmland and paralyzing 
growth in a place in desperate need of more housing and higher-paying jobs to 
accommodate newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents are waging a fierce campaign to derail the project that has been in 
the works since 1968, when former Rep. Wayne Aspinall of Colorado, now 
deceased, swapped his support for the massive Central Arizona Project in return 
for Arizona lawmakers' approval of five smaller water projects in his district. 
Animas-La Plata is one of those projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the project will require the equivalent of the electricity needed 
to power a city of 60,000 people in order to pump water out of the Animas River 
and up a 500-foot mountain into a ridge-top basin where elk and deer now forage 
amid clumps of cedar and rabbit brush. 
</P>
<P>
 It will also require a vast system of canals and pipelines to deliver water to 
irrigate 68,000 acres of farmland and provide municipal and industrial water 
for Durango and the New Mexico cities of Farmington, Aztec and Bloomfield. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that the project, which is estimated to take 12 years to build, 
will be constructed in two phases, only one of which will be federally 
subsidized. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first phase, the federal government will pick up most of the estimated 
$400-million tab for the reservoir-and-pumping complex, to be built just south 
of Durango, and for a system to deliver water to about 43,000 acres of 
farmland, water officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is yet to be determined who will pay for the second phase, which calls for 
a smaller reservoir near the New Mexico border and a system to deliver water 
for irrigating about 25,000 acres of farmland. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the cost to the tribes for all this could exceed $160 million -- a 
sticking point that has deeply divided the Southern Utes, who are supposed to 
be primary beneficiaries of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have a dam full of water and won't be able to afford to do a damned 
thing with it," said Southern Ute tribal councilman Ray Frost, an opponent of 
the project. "Because it's a cost-sharing deal, I'm afraid we'll only be 
saddling our future generations with an enormous bill." 
</P>
<P>
 The water district, however, recently hired a Denver consulting firm to 
produce a new cost analysis of the project. That study, which cost $45,000, 
shows that the project will more than pay for itself, a water district official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund has filed a federal lawsuit 
alleging that the project will alter flows in the Animas River needed by 
endangered fish downstream -- a problem under study by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife 
Service and the Bureau of Reclamation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Durango historian and fly-fishing enthusiast Richard Ellis said lower 
water levels may be a necessary sacrifice to ensure the region's economic 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 "If indeed the city of Durango is facing an impending water shortage," Ellis 
said, standing hip-deep in the Animas River and casting into a trout-laden pool 
in sight of downtown office buildings, "then Animas-La Plata is probably its 
solution." 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, the project has been put on hold pending completion of a Bureau of 
Reclamation effort to comply with federal requirements. The National 
Environmental Policy Act requires detailed studies of how federal actions will 
affect wilderness lands, water quality and endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress will weigh those studies in June. If the bureau passes that hurdle, 
construction is expected to begin in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond economic and environmental concerns are allegations that the project 
has been politically driven for more than 30 years by an influential Durango 
attorney representing dozens of clients who some say have seemingly conflicting 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Frank E. (Sam) Maynes, 61, is an expert on water law in the region. 
He represents the Southern Ute Tribal Council and its chairman, Leonard Burch; 
the powerful Southwestern Water Conservancy District and the Animas-La Plata 
Water Conservancy District. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line, Maynes said, is that "you can't put a value on the United 
States fulfilling its obligations to Indian tribes that have been unfairly 
deprived. A deal's a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Indians go back to court, it could cost the government hundreds of 
millions of dollars and a hell of a lot more than that in terms of relations 
between Indians and non-Indian neighbors in Colorado and New Mexico, to say 
nothing of the government turning its back again on Indians." 
</P>
<P>
 State Republican leaders and local water authorities hope for progress now 
that Democrats are no longer heading the House and Senate committees they claim 
have deliberately stalled Colorado water projects for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now reason is going to bring more balance into the formula," said Rep. Scott 
McInnis (R-Colo.), a project supporter who has a seat on the House Natural 
Resources Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't build it, the Indians should and will sue the government, and we 
will lose that lawsuit -- only after spending millions of dollars in litigation 
costs," McInnis said. "Then the court may order that it be built anyway. 
Meanwhile, inflation will make it even more expensive than it already is." 
</P>
<P>
 Project supporter Wayne Cook, executive director of the Upper Colorado River 
Commission and former head of project development for the Bureau of 
Reclamation, is not so optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have now is a soft bureau that can't stomach environmental problems, 
a Congress that's out of money and groups that hate the project -- all of which 
adds up to tough sledding ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the strength and leadership to get it built will not come from the 
bureau but from locals, the tribes and the state -- or it'll never happen," 
Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, according to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congress had made it clear," Babbitt said. "My instructions are to go forward 
with Animas-La Plata, and I intend to do that."

IT SEEMS AT&T HAS COME UP WITH RIGHT NUMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Not everyone is having trouble doing business in China. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T's USA Direct service is one way the company found to avoid problems that 
trip up other foreign ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how it works: 
</P>
<P>
 Suppose Xiao Wang wants to call his cousin in Los Angeles but, like most 
people in China, doesn't have a phone or the means to pay for an expensive 
long-distance call. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he can go to the neighborhood phone booth and dial 10810 for access to a 
Chinese-speaking AT&T operator. 
</P>
<P>
 Cousin Wang in America pays for the call, which would otherwise cost Xiao Wang 
about three days' wages for three minutes. AT&T receives payment in the United 
States for the service, sidestepping two bugbears of business in China -- 
getting paid in foreign exchange and repatriating profits. 
</P>
<P>
 It took several years to set up USA Direct in China, much longer than in other 
countries, said AT&T regional managing director Darryl Green. But the service 
is bringing in immediate profits. 
</P>
<P>
 The toughest part of negotiations was to convince the government-owned 
telephone company that AT&T wouldn't usurp profitable long-distance traffic but 
would, instead, boost phone use and bring in more foreign exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 "For every person who calls out of China now, 10 people call in," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a positive cycle: AT&T settles the difference with China in 
foreign exchange, which the government often uses to pay for telecommunications 
equipment from AT&T. 
</P>
<P>
 China plans to install 12 million to 15 million new telephone lines annually, 
the equivalent of a U.S. Baby Bell a year, and packages like this give AT&T a 
competitive edge. "It's almost like self-financing," Green said. "Everybody 
wins." 
</P>
<P>
 Marketing USA Direct brought a whole different set of challenges. People 
dislike having others pay for them, Green said, so using a Mandarin-speaking 
operator as an intermediary helps overcome that resistance. AT&T ads in the 
United States encourage people to send special calling cards to friends and 
relatives in China to make it even easier to pick up the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 In China, AT&T passed out 25 million bicycle fender stickers to advertise 
10810; at the launch in Shanghai, it gave away free three-minute phone calls 
for the first 200 people to arrive. "Thousands of people showed up," Green 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the first person in line was a 93-year-old scientist who once worked at 
Bell Labs in Princeton, N.J. He had camped out all night so he could call his 
brother in America. "He made the inaugural call," Green said. "It seemed 
appropriate."

FAMILY, FRIENDS TRY TO MAKE SENSE OF MARINE'S SUICIDE; MILITARY: SGT. RICHARD 
STUMPF'S DEATH IS BEING EXAMINED BY THE PENTAGON. BUT FOR THOSE CLOSEST TO HIM, 
THE REASON WHY HE KILLED HIMSELF BAFFLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Carla Stumpf sat on her back porch, feeling the first jolts of labor pain. It 
was then that she sensed her husband's presence nearby, as if he had returned 
to tell her how he had died. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a man and I was a soldier and I was fighting a war within myself," he 
seemed to say. "I died in combat." 
</P>
<P>
 When he died, Sgt. Richard Edward Stumpf Jr. was 24, six years a member of the 
U.S. Marine Corps, a veteran of the Persian Gulf War and for two years a drill 
instructor. 
</P>
<P>
 He was brash and he sought adventure and he loved derring-do. He liked to swim 
and to cook and, oh, how he loved to drink beer. He was a happy torrent of a 
man, broad-shouldered and blue-eyed, with a booming voice that could shake a 
barracks full of Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stumpf had a darker side. He pushed himself unforgivingly. He pulled long 
hours on the drill field. He was tortured by even the smallest mistake. He 
feared he could not handle the added responsibility of a child; he anguished 
over separation from his family and betrayal by the Marine Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 And so crumbled the once rock-hard Marine that was Rich Stumpf. 
</P>
<P>
 One morning in October, he walked into the Indoor Combat Training Pool at 
Parris Island, S.C. He climbed atop the diving board. He tossed his hat into 
the water and he placed an M-16 service rifle under his chin. Before 200 
Marines and Marine recruits, in his Marine uniform on a Marine base, Stumpf 
pulled the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 Who was he? 
</P>
<P>
 For the nation's military, he became another statistic, another line on a 
press release about the high number of suicides among service members, 
particularly Marines. His death and others are being examined by Pentagon 
officials hoping to determine whether, by improving psychological and other 
support programs, future suicides might be prevented. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each one is investigated very, very carefully to get a sense of what may have 
caused it," said Undersecretary of Defense Edwin Dorn. 
</P>
<P>
 Making sense of Stumpf's journey to life's end will not be easy. He was 
complex and sometimes rash, often inexplicable in his sudden turns of emotion. 
Even after his body was lowered into a grave in the national cemetery in 
Bourne, Mass., his death baffles. 
</P>
<P>
 To some, he died making an angry statement against the Marine Corps, a sort of 
"Here's to you for driving me to do this." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was obviously striking back at something he loved the most," said Carl 
Peterson, a former career Marine and a municipal judge who visited Stumpf on 
his last weekend, in a jail drunk tank. 
</P>
<P>
 But Depot Sgt. Maj. James E. Moore, who supervised Stumpf's drill instruction, 
said it was impossible to "really, really tell who he was angry at." He thinks 
of Stumpf and he asks: "My God, what could cause a person to do that, and to do 
it in that way?" 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Cmdr. Charles Quarles, a chaplain who counsels troubled Marines, tried to 
draw Stumpf out of his depression in his last month at Parris Island. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very possible he was mad at the Marines," Quarles said. "It's extremely 
possible. It makes sense. It's logical. But is it the truth? Who knows? I think 
he was a man in a lot of pain for a lot of reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 In Arcadia, where his widow and 2-month-old son now must build their life 
without him, they will always suspect that the military, combined with Stumpf's 
own desire to be the best Marine, sent him to an early death. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm angry at the Marines, it's only because they put the weapon in his 
hand," Carla Stumpf said. "They could have prevented that. But ultimately, the 
decision to do what he did was his." 
</P>
<P>
 She met him in high school. He had moved to Florida with his family from 
Connecticut. He loved to swim and hunt seashells. He performed magic tricks. He 
liked movies with plenty of action and food with lots of garlic. He learned to 
cook and to bake bread. He had a Doberman pinscher named Drock, said his 
father, Richard E. Stumpf Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Carla began dating at age 15 in Sarasota, Fla. Like all things, he 
threw himself completely into their courtship. He painted "I Love Carla" across 
his bedroom wall. 
</P>
<P>
 He also discovered beer, fast cars and a knack for ditching school. He 
graduated from Riverview High only after repeating his senior year. "He was 
looking for the biggest challenge he could find," Carla said. "Some guidance 
and a place to fit in. He wanted to go where he could find some adventure. And 
once he joined the Marines, he knew that was his destiny." 
</P>
<P>
 Enlisting in 1988, he was sent to boot camp at Parris Island. He excelled at 
swimming. To toughen him up, they made him march on all fours. He loved to push 
his body, the building of a man, the long hours, the long march and always the 
challenge. He graduated 13th in a class of 85 recruits. Seemingly overnight, 
the kid was a Marine. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, he married Carla in a ceremony at the Ringling Circus Museum in 
Sarasota, the bridegroom resplendent in his dress uniform. But his dedication, 
even then, tilted more to the Corps. He had her name and a rose tattooed on his 
left arm, but on his right shoulder in big letters was "USMC." And below that, 
the Marine Corps symbol: the eagle, globe and anchor. Inside Carla's wedding 
ring, he inscribed the Marine Corps motto: Semper fidelis.  
</P>
<P>
 It was always the Marines, and Carla would often feel second in her husband's 
devotion. It was a situation she would have to cope with during their long 
periods apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a year into their marriage, he volunteered for the Persian Gulf War. For 
eight months, he served as a squad leader in the Marine infantry but still 
found time to play the mischievous boy in a man's war. He refused to take drugs 
to ward off chemical illnesses. Once his squad ran off with an Iraqi ambulance. 
He passed out M&Ms sent from home. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was one of the first to go and one of the last to come back," Carla 
remembered. "If he hadn't served there, he would have been even more tortured. 
He was not afraid to die. Through my entire life with him, he made that clear 
to me and everyone. He was going to die with that uniform on." 
</P>
<P>
 He came home not a casualty, but a hero nonetheless. At his parents' First 
Methodist Church in Meriden, Conn., he stood up in uniform to the applause of 
the congregation. He gave a brief speech about duty and honor, and vowed that 
as long as there were Saddam Husseins in this world, he would always be a 
Marine. He cried that day, a crack in his tough Marine armor. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted to be the picture-perfect Marine," said his mother, Mary Stumpf. 
"He strove. He was never content with any particular rank. He had to just go 
for the next and the next and the next." 
</P>
<P>
 He and Carla would separate again. He went to the U.S. naval base at 
Guantanamo, Cuba, for three months to help process Cuban and Haitian refugees. 
When he returned, they bought a house at Camp Lejeune, N.C. Then came another 
separation when he left Carla at home for a choice assignment as a drill 
instructor 100 miles down the coast at Parris Island. 
</P>
<P>
 To make it through training school, he learned 75 pages of drill movement, 
proved himself again on the field, underwent a dozen uniform inspections and 
memorized countless Marine Corps rules and regulations. But the rewards could 
be high. Two years as a drill instructor would mean a shot at meritorious 
promotions and special consideration for assignments. He would be gone all day 
and many nights, working, training, drilling boys into men. He would love it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I want to do is better the Marine Corps," he told the Navy 
Times in an interview last February. "I wanted to come down here and put 110% 
into these kids so that when they get out in the streets, they'll have a role 
model to look back at and be able to keep that esprit de corps flowing through 
their veins." 
</P>
<P>
 And drill school wasn't that tough, anyway. "I'm not a scholar or anything," 
he said. "I had my few beers during the week and did what I had to do." 
</P>
<P>
 For 20 months he was alone with his Marines. In July, his relatives attended a 
recruit graduation. One recruit, Pfc. Joseph L. Gillick, suddenly broke down in 
tears in front of his drill instructor. Asked later why he was so moved, 
Gillick barked back in Marine cadence: "That man is Sgt. Richard Stumpf. He 
changed my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Carla was pregnant by then. They decided that in September she would move to 
Arcadia to be with her mother, Judith Leipold, to await their first baby. 
Stumpf would join them on the due date. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the end of summer his mood began to darken. In phone conversations, he 
would not tell Carla why he was depressed. Instead, he rambled, once suggesting 
that they legally separate, several times hinting that she would have to raise 
the baby alone. And then he began to doubt the Marine Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew what the Marine Corps expected of him, and he pushed himself even 
further," she said. "We were talking every day. It was all about him and his 
state of mind. He was constantly saying he was overwhelmed. He felt he had let 
himself down. He said he wanted out of Parris Island, something I never thought 
I'd hear from him. He called it a hellhole." 
</P>
<P>
 She begged him to seek counseling, but Marines mask their emotions. He was 
drinking more, and, when only the happy-go-lucky Stumpf shined forth, no one 
suspected any problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very fun-loving, he liked to have fun," said Michelle Russom, a 
bartender at the Port Royal Pub, an after-hours spot for Parris Island Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 She had met him in those last weeks and never once thought he was depressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Others missed it too. 
</P>
<P>
 "On two occasions that I spoke with him, he said nothing," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Staff Sgt. Troy Stables, who once supervised Stumpf at Parris Island: 
"The week before, he was fine. He was laughing and joking." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Oct. 28, he slammed his yellow Volkswagen Beetle into another car 
in Beaufort, S.C., near the base. He was arrested for driving while 
intoxicated. The accident occurred at 10:30 p.m., and he told police he had had 
"eight beers before leaving Parris Island at 4:30 and had been drinking ever 
since." 
</P>
<P>
 At the police station, he couldn't understand the simplest directions for 
taking a Breathalyzer test. Finally, he tested at a blood-alcohol level of .22, 
more than double the legal limit. He was jailed overnight. Judge Peterson 
visited him the next day to set bail. He saw a Marine at the end of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 A retired Marine himself, Peterson knew all too well how a drunk driving 
charge could end a career in today's military. Looking at Stumpf in his cell, 
in his orange jail jumper rather than his shiny Marine uniform, he saw "a guy 
who was a sergeant, who had been on the selection list for staff sergeant, who 
probably had once been on the right track." 
</P>
<P>
 Stumpf called Carla shortly before he was released on Saturday, Oct. 29. He 
was paranoid about his Marine superiors. "They're watching me," he told her. 
"They're waiting for me to screw up. They're trying to get me." 
</P>
<P>
 Carla was frantic. "I think by that point his mind was made up. There were 
tears in his voice." Three times she called the base and urged his commanders 
to immediately send him to counseling. She said they did not understand him, 
that he would not be able to cope with the arrest, that he needed help now. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she was told that counseling would begin first thing Monday, Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Monday morning, Stumpf went instead to the base armory and checked out 
the M-16 rifle. Then to the pool and the diving board. One shot under the chin, 
and his body toppled into the water. None of the startled Marines realized at 
first what had happened. Then the water turned red. 
</P>
<P>
 Stables prepared him for burial in his dress blue uniform and white gloves. He 
shined Stumpf's shoes and brass, and he escorted the coffin to the cemetery in 
Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 Carla never saw her husband's body. She had gone into labor, and, on the day 
of the funeral, at the moment taps were sounded over the grave, she gave birth 
to their son, Asher Richard Edward Stumpf. 
</P>
<P>
 Asher, from the Bible, means "happy one."

 A draft of the Senate report on the first Whitewater hearings details numerous 
conflicts in Clinton Administration officials' testimony this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 It also points out that the Resolution Trust Corp., the savings and loan 
cleanup agency, did not follow its own written policy in handling a criminal 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate Banking Committee set out to determine whether President Clinton's 
aides acted improperly when they gathered information about the S&L 
investigation of the Clintons' Arkansas business dealings, particularly the 
Whitewater real estate venture. 
</P>
<P>
 But the panel's 300-page draft of the report, dated Dec. 5, does not draw any 
conclusions about the legality or propriety of the Administration's conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats who wrote the draft are working on a section that will make some 
recommendations about procedures for handling Administration discussions about 
sensitive investigations. Republican members of the panel are preparing their 
own views, certain to draw on their many public criticisms. 
</P>
<P>
 The report is set to be released Jan. 3, the last day before Congress changes 
to a Republican majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the draft is dedicated to recounting instances in which Administration 
officials could not recall key events or gave conflicting testimony. Deputy 
Treasury Secretary Roger Altman and Treasury General Counsel Jean Hanson are 
most frequently cited. Both resigned after the hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft noted that Hanson testified she did not believe she was told to keep 
confidential information she got about nine criminal referrals from the RTC 
investigation that named the Clintons as potential witnesses to possible 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 RTC official William Roelle "testified that he explained to Ms. Hanson that 
'we need to make sure these are kept confidential,' " the draft stated. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also cited questions about Altman's testimony. It noted that 
neither Altman nor departed White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum recalled 
anything about a Whitewater-related fax in Nussbaum's files indicating it came 
from Altman.

INS TO SHIFT WORK CARD ISSUANCE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Immigration and Naturalization Service will centralize the issuance of 
work cards for immigrants in 1995, an agency official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The work cards, issued pending hearings on immigration status, now are 
available through all 35 INS offices across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 But starting sometime next year, they will be issued by mail through the 
agency's regional service centers. The district offices will still process the 
applications, but the cards will be issued by the service centers. 
</P>
<P>
 The change is to reduce the temptation for INS employees to take bribes, the 
New York Times reported Monday. Work cards for illegal immigrants can fetch 
$500 or more on the black market. 
</P>
<P>
 The immigration agency operates service centers in Dallas, Laguna Nigel; 
Lincoln, Neb., and Burlington, Vt.

FBI STUNG IN MEDICARE STING GONE AWRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 FBI agents thought they were setting a trap by buying copies of 35 Medicare 
cards and selling them to a suspected fraud operation. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the cards are being used to buy expensive medical equipment -- and the 
FBI can't track them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FBI lost control of the cards. Now they have a monster on their hands," a 
government investigator familiar with the case said in a Miami Herald article 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Medicare says it can't cancel the copied cards, which have been circulating 
for 16 months, because that would wipe out legitimate benefits to the people 
whose names are on those cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your Medicare number is the same as your Social Security number," said Faye 
Baggiano, associate administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration 
in Washington. "And Social Security numbers are issued for life." 
</P>
<P>
 Medicare routinely provides phony numbers that can be canceled once an 
investigation is complete. It isn't known why the FBI insisted on using real 
names and authentic Medicare numbers for this investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Miami Herald said it examined the Medicare records of 10 people whose 
numbers were sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-three clinics and companies billed Medicare a total of $163,745 for 
services that the real cardholders say they never received nor tried to 
receive. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the 10, Esther Machado, said Medicare paid a claim in her name for 
$3,205 for leg braces. Nothing is wrong with her legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria and Rogelio Rodriguez have lungs that work fine, but someone using fake 
cards with their names and Medicare numbers was paid $5,484 for his-and-her 
oxygen equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can they let this happen to people they are supposed to protect?" asked 
Maria Gutierrez, 76, whose card was used for a $2,555 claim for a six-month 
supply of feeding tubes and liquid formula. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI and Medicare are still investigating, but there have been no arrests.

GAY COUPLE WINS COURT BATTLE TO ADOPT BOY, 4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A gay couple has been allowed to adopt a 4-year-old boy, ending a custody 
struggle with the boy's mother, who gave him away and then tried to get him 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross and Luis Lopton, who had been the boy's foster parents, and a King County 
Superior Court commissioner signed the adoption papers Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm living here forever," the boy, Gailen, told the Seattle 
Post-Intelligencer. He calls Ross "Daddy" and Luis "Papa." 
</P>
<P>
 Gailen was placed with the Loptons in September, 1993, a year after his 
mother, Megan Lucas, surrendered her parental rights. 
</P>
<P>
 When she learned that Gailen had been placed with a gay couple, Lucas tried to 
rescind her decision. But a Superior Court judge rejected the request because 
it was filed a day too late under state law. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas, who bore Gailen as an unwed teen-ager, then tried to adopt him, but the 
courts rejected that attempt too. State officials also cited her history of 
drug and alcohol abuse and a criminal record dating from age 11. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, a five-judge panel of the state Supreme Court refused to hear 
her appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington is one of six states that permits adoptions by gay couples. Six 
states have outlawed adoptions by same-sex couples. 
</P>
<P>
 The Loptons, who are bankers, spent four years in training and counseling to 
become foster -- and then adoptive -- parents.

LARGE, BRIGHT OBJECT REPORTED SHOOTING ACROSS CALIFORNIA SKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 People across Southern California and as far away as Reno called news media 
organizations, fire stations and astronomers to report that they saw a large 
object shoot across the night sky Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gotten calls since about 8:30 tonight and basically we believe it was a 
meteor," said Griffith Observatory guide Joel Harris. "It's not that unusual, 
but since people reported seeing it from far places we think it might have been 
bigger than most." 
</P>
<P>
 Callers from Sacramento, Riverside, Bakersfield and Reno described the 
shooting object as a big, bright light with a green, white or red tail.

SURFER, 50, DIES WHILE RIDING THE WAVES; TRAGEDY: THE MAN APPARENTLY SUFFERS A 
HEART ATTACK IN WATERS OFF PACIFIC PALISADES. AT LAGUNA BEACH, THREE SWIMMERS 
ARE INJURED WHEN SWEPT ONTO COASTAL ROCKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 50-year-old surfer died Monday in the waters off Pacific Palisades after he 
apparently suffered a heart attack while riding the waves, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses summoned lifeguards after spotting the victim about 11:30 a.m., 
floating motionless in the ocean off the 17300 block of Pacific Coast Highway, 
south of Sunset Boulevard. The man was still attached to his surfboard by a 
leash. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said the man was believed to have gone into full cardiac arrest 
while he was surfing on a day when the warm weather brought large holiday 
crowds to area beaches. The victim's name was not released at the request of 
his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Monday, three young men from Laguna Hills were injured as they swam in 
rough seas and were swept onto the coastal rocks at Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Sedwick, 21, and Andrew McIntyre, 20, were taken to South Coast Medical 
Center and treated for severe cuts and bruises, Orange County Fire Department 
officials said. McIntyre's younger brother, Kevin, also was caught in the 
waves, but his injuries were not as serious and he was treated at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Sedwick and the older McIntyre, both on vacation from college, had decided to 
swim from the northwest tip of Three Arch Bay in Laguna Beach to a beach near 
the southeast point of the bay. But somewhere along the way, "they realized it 
was rougher than they thought" and decided to return to shore, said Teri 
Sedwick, Eric's mother. 
</P>
<P>
 The rising tide pushed the three youths toward the rocky cliffs and smashed 
them into the rocks, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A fisherman called 911 with his cellular telephone, and a Costa Mesa Police 
Department helicopter soon plucked Sedwick and the elder McIntyre from the 
beach and carried them to a nearby golf course, where they were met by an 
ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Northern California, waves like the record-breaking swells that 
took the life of a world-famous surfer last week claimed two victims Monday 
when an inflatable boat capsized during a pleasure ride in Tomales Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 A 10-year-old boy and his 34-year-old mother died and a man was in stable 
condition at Santa Rosa Kaiser Hospital with mild hypothermia. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other men were airlifted off Tomales Point by helicopter as they were 
trying to hike to safety. They declined medical treatment, saying they were 
unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
 The waves that caused the inflatable boat to capsize were the result of the 
same storm out of the Gulf of Alaska that has caused 30-foot waves off Half 
Moon Bay, about 50 miles south. World-renowned surfer Mark Foo, 36, died there 
Friday when he was knocked into the water and hit on the head by part of his 
broken surfboard.

4 KILLED IN HAITI AS EX-SOLDIERS RIOT IN DEMAND FOR BACK PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scores of discharged soldiers stormed into army headquarters Monday to demand 
back pay, prompting gunfights that left four people dead and at least four 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 When the shooting erupted, U.S. soldiers in the Haiti occupation force 
surrounded the building. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. Army source said American military police exchanged fire with the 
ex-soldiers, who apparently were supported by some active-duty colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 It's unclear how many, if any, of those shot were hit by the U.S. soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who has slashed the size of the repressive 
army that ousted him from 6,000 to 1,500 since his return in October, went on 
private Radio Metropole to appeal for calm. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. soldiers had the situation under control about two hours after the 
violence erupted, and arrested at least a dozen people in the headquarters 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The army is widely hated in Haiti for its years of brutal rule. During the 
standoff, hundreds of people massed on the plaza in front of the building, and, 
referring to the arrested ex-soldiers, chanted "Kill them! Kill them!"

 Robert L. Citron -- Orange County Counsel Terry A. Andrus said that he did not 
cite a growing "pattern of deception and misrepresentation" in a draft letter 
that would have rejected payment of legal fees for former Treasurer-Tax 
Collector Robert L. Citron.A Times story on Sunday said that language was in a 
draft that was never sent. Knowledgeable sources, however, said that such 
language was used in discussions by the county counsel before a draft was 
written. Andrus said the draft letter focused on whether paying for Citron's 
defense would create a conflict of interest for the county. The county still 
has not decided whether to pay Citron's legal fees.
