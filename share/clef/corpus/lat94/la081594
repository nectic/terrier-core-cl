OTHER MEDIA; INDIA JOURNAL; WILSON IGNORES WORK ETHIC OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From a column by Nimmi Raghunathan in India Journal, a weekly published in 
Emeryville, Ca., and distributed statewide.

 Take a walk on Pioneer Boulevard. Look at the salespeople, the waiters, the 
cooks. What do you see? People working hard, long hours at minimum wages, 
trying to make those greenbacks which will allow them to pay their taxes, their 
rent and high school tuition. They are not on welfare, have no insurance, no 
car in a city that has practically no public transport worth its name, and they 
owe their very survival to their employer. 
</P>
<P>
 But these conditions seem less terrible than what they had to put up with back 
home, in India. In America, it's easier to get a job that pays. Even better, 
American does not dim the stars in the eyes they come with when they get across 
the border -- several even go on to own their own small businesses. Their 
children learn English, understand the value of hard work and money early 
enough to pick up jobs at the McDonald's and the Thriftys so they can put 
themselves through school. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson doesn't see it this way. He can't afford to. He is running 
for office again. And when times are tough, California politicians find 
immigrant-bashing the easiest way of getting and diverting attention. They have 
done it to the Chinese, the Japanese and now it's the Mexicans and Asians. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer to the state's social and economic woes, as Wilson sees it, is 
immigration. He doesn't believe that immigrants come here for economic 
betterment. They come here, he claims, for social services. He doesn't care to 
look at studies that show new entrants don't like to be on welfare and average 
lower levels of welfare than citizens. He obviously does not know that within 
three to five years their earnings surpass the average American household and 
they begin to pay taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 So, he has embraced SOS -- the oxymoron acronym for the xenophobic Save Our 
State initiative which, anyway you look at it, is a legal and moral mire. 
Purportedly, the initiative, which will be voted on in November, seeks to stem 
illegal immigration to California. 
</P>
<P>
 While no one can condone illegal immigration, the means used are questionable. 
The central idea of this is to deny and expel any child from school who does 
not have documents to prove his or her legal status. And if the school finds 
out that either of the parents is undocumented, they will hear from the INS. 
Schools in the future will do more than educate -- they will be the 
authorities' unofficial spooks. Remind you of the Stalin era?

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TODAY'S TOPIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of all the challenges of living in southern California, perhaps none is more 
vexing than getting to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some commuters use public transportation, most -- about 85%, or 3.5 
million people in Los Angeles County alone, according to 1990 U.S. Census 
Bureau figures -- get behind the wheel of a car each workday. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic on most freeways can be intolerable and one accident can tie things up 
for hours. Still, Southern Californians overwhelmingly prefer the sound of the 
morning traffic report to the sound of a train whistle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is that automobiles, with their stereo systems and the flexibility 
they provide, will always be more attractive than public transportation," says 
Franklin White, chief executive officer of the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until it is as painful to use the automobile as it is in other cities, people 
will not move to mass transit," White adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet mass transportation is a prominent concern, at least according to the 
responses Voices received in response to the Times' special July 17 section 
"The Next Los Angeles," which focused on creative solutions to some of this 
area's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Those comments, some of which are printed in today's Readers Respond, indicate 
that many commuters are not looking for such long-term and expensive solutions 
as railway and subway systems. They want people movers, bicycle lanes, minivans 
and more motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need more personalized solutions," says Catherine Burke, an associate 
professor of public administration at USC. "Mass transit was for the 19th 
Century; it shaped cities. If heavy-duty rail systems would solve problems, New 
York would be paradise." 
</P>
<P>
 Burke, who calls building a railway system "an outrageous expenditure of 
public funds," agrees that such low-tech solutions as minivans and bicycle 
lanes are good ideas if safety issues can be resolved. "I would open up public 
transit to private operators and allow people to develop things like minivans," 
Burke says. "But you need to have some assurance that you are not going to be 
attacked on these minivans. If we could make it safe to ride a bicycle, that 
would be great." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County is experimenting to see if simpler solutions, such as 
transporting people to trains in smaller buses, will take more cars off the 
roads, says David Elbaum, director of planning and development for the county 
transportation authority. "Roads are always going to be the foundation to 
mobility," Elbaum says. "They're convenient and flexible. The key question is, 
'Do you invest in a rail system to prevent future congestion?' " 
</P>
<P>
 It's a question that Los Angeles County has already settled. The MTA is 
spending $870 million annually, including debt service, on railway systems, 
including subways. 
</P>
<P>
 "The answer to people who don't understand why we're building this rail system 
is that we're focusing on tomorrow," White says. "The rail system we are 
building must be seen as a supplement to a highway and road system that will be 
unable to meet the demands of the future."

OTHER MEDIA; THE SENTINEL; 'WE ARE MASTERS AT KNOWING RACISM WHEN WE SEE IT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By The Sentinel is an African-American weekly published in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Compton Police Officer Michael Jackson, an African American, was caught on 
videotape pummeling a Latino youth into submission, first with a nightstick to 
the head and torso, then with a knee to the small of the back. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer claims that the victim initially took a swing at him, and that the 
videotape doesn't tell the whole story. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Sentinel -- and we dare say virtually the entire 
African-American leadership in Southern California -- have long been leading 
critics of police brutality against minorities of every hue, religion and 
sexual preference. We dare anyone to say otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 We raise that issue because there are many in the Southland who believe that 
the beating was racially motivated. And, they have used this issue to raise 
other issues of alleged racial friction between African Americans and 
Hispanics, both in Compton and in other communities. 
</P>
<P>
 It is interesting that the Compton incident is being heralded by many as a 
racial issue, but other issues featuring Latino instigators are not. Cases in 
point: criticism of the black-brown employment situation led by County 
Supervisor Gloria Molina at the Martin Luther King Jr./Charles Drew Medical 
Center; and last week's attack on black employment within the U.S. Postal 
Service by the Latino head of the State Republican Party, who is also 
vice-chairman of the executive board of governors of the U.S. Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, the Sentinel abhors police brutality no matter who perpetrates it. But 
we take issue with those who want to tell us what racism is in Southern 
California when we are past masters at knowing when we see it.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: YOUTH OPINION; 'IT 
FELT GOOD TO REVEL IN EACH OTHER'S CULTURE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HAE JIN LEE, This essay was a first-prize winner in the 1994 national essay 
contest sponsored by the Korea Society. Hae Jin Lee recently graduated from the 
Harvard-Westlake school in North Hollywood. She will enter Pomona College this 
fall. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In our world of advanced technology and increasing interdependence among 
countries, there is a fear that globalization will blur the cultures and make 
them obsolete. This fear is part of what drives people to ethnocentricity and a 
thirst for dominance, the extreme consequence of which is bloodshed. News 
images from Eastern Europe and Africa are a painful reminder of what can 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
 To realize a truly multicultural society, nations and individuals must 
actively educate themselves and others about their own and others' societies, 
so that respect for the way other people think and do things develops. A 
multicultural society does not mean a passive acceptance of every aspect of 
every culture, but seeing with unfiltered vision the good and bad that exist in 
all cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 As a Korean American young woman, I believe that having pride in my heritage 
and expressing my pride to others is one way to fulfill my vision. While I was 
backpacking through the Sierra with Dori Erlich, I taught her an old Korean 
folk song. In return, she taught me the Yiddish song to the Jewish alphabet. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember how intrigued she was to learn what my song said. It seemed like 
such a trivial thing. But I can remember distinctly how good it felt to revel 
in each other's and our own culture. This is what living in a multicultural 
society should be like. 
</P>
<P>
 I know that without understanding the richness of my own cultural heritage, I 
cannot hope to contribute toward a multicultural community. Through my 
involvement with the Korean Tea Ritual Assn. of Los Angeles, I have partaken of 
the ancient tea ceremony custom, been fascinated with our artistic heritage and 
have seen and felt the dignity of my people and our ways.  
</P>
<P>
 At my predominantly white school, I find the need to let others know what I am 
about. During Women's History Month I chose to present the story of Yu Kwan 
Sun, a young Korean martyr who died protesting for freedom. The stereotype that 
women in our culture do not have a voice can be corrected by educating others 
in these kind of small but significant ways.  
</P>
<P>
 Compared to the United States, which has a tradition of pluralism deeply 
embedded in its short history, Korea was and remains a homogenous country. In 
the Korean American community in Los Angeles where I grew up, I see the need 
for acknowledgments of other cultures. We cannot hold on to just our own values 
since we have to take into account the people we are living with.  
</P>
<P>
 I believe Korean Americans experienced great loss in the 1992 riots because 
the community was successful only within its own context. The store owners 
earned the means to support their families and, through hard work, achieved 
what seemed to be the American dream. But this did not necessarily guarantee a 
successful coexistence within a multicultural society. There needed to be an 
understanding between the Korean Americans and the black and Latino citizens of 
the community. The Korean Americans also suffered loss because there was no one 
to represent us within the power structure.  
</P>
<P>
 It is clear that multiculturalism and diversity are not part of the Korean 
heritage. But times are changing fast and Koreans can no longer stay separate 
from the mainstream society. Instead, we must actively communicate with 
different groups and break down the mountains of ignorance dividing us. There 
is a very fine line between pride for one's culture and ethnocentricity.

OTHER MEDIA; RAFU SHIMPO; TRADITIONAL JAPANESE FESTIVAL ACQUIRES L.A. FLAVOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a column by Brian Niiya in Rafu Shimpo, a daily published in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Japanese Americans, summer means obon season. Up and down the West Coast 
and in other areas where there is a significant JA presence, obons take place 
on virtually every weekend.To us Sansei and Yonsei (third- and 
fourth-generation Japanese Americans), they are like mini-carnivals, a place to 
eat teriyaki chicken and grilled corn on the cob, play carnival games and meet 
other young people. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering this carnival atmosphere, it's a bit surprising to note that the 
origins of the obon festival have to do with commemorating the spirits of the 
dead. In its traditional Japanese incarnation, the obon festival is a Buddhist 
ritual involving the return of the spirits of the dead to earth. Over a period 
of three days, graves are tended, food offerings are made, and religious 
ceremonies are held. As with many other elements of Japanese culture, this 
mostly private ceremony has evolved into something entirely different in a 
Japanese-American context. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, Japanese-American obons are put on by Buddhist churches as 
fund-raisers. Other community groups also participate by putting on games or by 
selling food or drink. Chicken teriyaki is the staple, featuring sauces 
concocted by Nisei women church members and cooked over the grill by their 
husbands. In the evening there is traditional dancing in the parking lot. 
Though I know nothing about dance, I swear that some of the moves I see owe 
more to the Temptations than anything "traditional."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: COMMUNITY COMMENT; 
CLAS TEST: 'IT IS NOT AN INVASIVE ACT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By More than 1 million children took the California Learning Assessment System 
test this spring. Opponents contend that portions of the essay-oriented CLAS 
test are too subjective, too political and too vague. Backers say the tests 
reflect learning, not memorization. Los Angeles English teacher GREGG HEACOCK, 
whose child took the test, tells why he thinks CLAS is valuable. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reading, like life, is an interactive process involving the mind. We cannot 
learn something new without relating it to what we already know. It is, 
therefore, not an invasive act to ask students to recall personal experiences 
that relate to a text. 
</P>
<P>
 When I teach logic in my classroom, I use Reginald Rose's "12 Angry Men," a 
play that entertains the question, through the perspective of 12 jurors on a 
murder trial, "How do we know what is true?"  
</P>
<P>
 The trial serves as the text. What goes on in the jury room is the 
interpretation and, hopefully, the understanding of that text. The questions a 
good reader asks are the very ones Rose addresses: What do you notice, what 
details, what patterns? What are the implications of what you notice? What 
emotions come up for you? What thoughts come up? How do those thoughts and 
emotions relate to what is being observed? And, finally, what conclusions can 
be drawn from this about what is being observed and about those doing the 
observing? 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, only one juror questions the evidence presented. The others 
regard the case as "open and shut." When this lone juror presents evidence that 
suggests the boy on trial might not be guilty, many jurors become extremely 
angry.  
</P>
<P>
 As jurors begin to interact with the evidence, even re-creating in the jury 
room some of the situations described in court (a wonderful model for 
interpretation!), they become enlivened to the issues in the case. Thoughts 
abound as to what is justice and how do you know if witnesses are reporting the 
truth or just what they think they heard or saw? In the end, as much is 
revealed about the jurors as about the case they are evaluating. 
</P>
<P>
 In this play, Rose makes the interesting point that the one way the jurors 
know the truth is to project their own experience on what they have observed in 
the courtroom. Prior experience can close a person off from considering all the 
possibilities or it can open a person up to what life and literature have to 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Even being wrong is not a misstep if it is a step toward being right. 
Literature, like life, confirms, challenges or extends our experience. 
</P>
<P>
 I think this provides the key to what is so controversial about the CLAS exam. 
It goes beyond reading for information. It calls on students to read for 
interpretation. It demands that we extend our thinking beyond the level of our 
preconceived notions. It insists that students be able to understand the world 
of art and humanities. In essence, it is a clarion call for a true cultural 
revolution.  
</P>
<P>
 I believe it is no coincidence that both the National Endowment for the Arts 
and the CLAS exam are under attack. Those who feel threatened by the arts are 
not unlike the jurors who angrily objected to new evidence that challenged 
their thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the fears people have about the CLAS exam can be quieted by 
understanding that the only way to go beyond what we know is through what we 
know. That's not losing ourselves; that's extending ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Being able to extend ourselves to the world around us is what reading and the 
CLAS test are all about.

TURNING IDEAS INTO ACTION; THE READERS RESPOND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the Times special section July 17, "The Next Los Angeles / Turning Ideas 
Into Action," readers were invited to tell us their ideas by calling TimesLink 
telephone numbers or sending an Internet message. Here are some of the 
responses.  
</P>

<P>
 GREGORY WRIGHT

</P>
<P>
 This is to propose the Los Angeles suggestion box, a permanent process and 
accumulating database of Angelenos' creative ideas, proposals and suggestions 
for our city and region. This permanent, on-going L.A. suggestion box could 
start with the proposals which The Times is collecting for the Next L.A. and 
include the Modest Proposals which have appeared in the Times Voices pages. It 
could offer aid as a public/private partnership of the Times, other local 
periodicals, the city and area L.A. schools and libraries and on the Internet. 
This region-wide participatory think tank would operationalize what we might 
call "ideation democracy" and permanently embody the goal printed in large 
letters on "The Next L.A:" to turn ideas into action. I would also propose the 
initiation of a sustained time-lapse record of selected locales in Los Angeles 
to create a visual record. Automated video cameras in a variety of well-chosen, 
secure locations would make a fascinating record for future Angelenos. These 
video cameras could be in the windows of high-rise buildings, on hilltops, on 
the marquees of buildings along boulevards and perhaps even on the Los Angeles 
City Hall tower. Funding could come from public arts and urban planning 
budgets, architects' associations and news media.

 I think that since moral values are not being taught by parents, it's time for 
the schools to assume some of that responsibility by overhauling their 
curricula to include assertiveness training, basic right-from-wrong skills 
training, and then rewarding these kids when they show proof that they are 
displaying these kinds of traits. I think that would go a long way to help our 
kids and to help the community in general. The proposals that have been offered 
so far in the past are too small and just are not comprehensive enough.

 If producers, directors, filmmakers and video-game makers can't commit to 
getting away from violence and encouraging disrespect within families and 
talking to each other in disrespectful ways, then we need to encourage parents 
to censor what kids watch. It is not a bad thing to censor what children watch 
because they are in their formative years. Parents now spend thousands of 
dollars on their nurseries, play equipment and childhood toys, yet they let 
children watch MTV, which is really poisoning their minds. If adults would 
actually watch MTV, they would be shocked to see what young people are being 
exposed to. This is daily fare for a lot of children who are home alone.

 I wanted to suggest something I saw in Hong Kong -- people movers. People 
movers are terrific because in a crowded central area they get people around 
and they also integrate different parts of a downtown city. I think it would be 
great to have a flow of people going in and out. People movers would really 
accomplish that and also give access to lots of different parts of the center. 
They are inexpensive, they can be covered, they are attractive and also 
facilitate not only movement but integration of different areas.

 Create some bike lanes, especially along some of the heavily traveled 
corridors of the city so that bikers could be encouraged to ride to work, which 
would cut down on pollution and noise and persuade more people to ride. A bike 
ride in a three- to six-mile radius can be done in almost the same amount of 
time as a car, so that would be the area (around downtown) that could be 
targeted.

 One form of transportation that has been completely ignored is that of 
motorcycles. The fact is at highway speeds motorcycles take up one-fourth the 
space of a car and at slow speeds motorcycles don't take up any space at all. 
They travel between the lanes. And when they are parked, motorcycles take up 
one-eighth the space of a private automobile. Motorcycles get four times the 
gas mileage of cars and they emit five times less air pollution. In addition 
motorcycles tread immeasurably lighter on road surfaces, which will lead to 
less maintenance of those roads. 
</P>
<P>
 While motorcycles are not for everyone, their recognition by officials and 
subsequent inclusion in a comprehensive transportation plan could significantly 
relieve congestion and promote mobility in Los Angeles.

 Use mini-vans on off hours, say from 9 or 10 at night until 6 in the morning. 
The buses that run then usually run empty. So I think mini-vans would save on 
gas and repairs. The buses are way too large running those hours. 
</P>
<P>
 DAVID QUESTION

<P>
 Instead of figuring out all of these car-pool lanes and subsidizing mass 
transit, simply charge the car for the full cost to society for its pollution 
and for its use of land. Then the cost of the car would go up and the cost of 
alternatives such as buses, bicycling to work, living closer to work and 
telecommuting, would go down. Until we charge the cars' full cost we're not 
going to get anywhere. The fee could be a large gas tax, perhaps as much as 
$4-per-gallon gas tax would be necessary to pay for the land and the pollution. 
And then all the other forms of transportation would become more economically 
feasible. I think that is the only way we can go. We need to get rid of the 
government bureaucracies, of course, and drop the prohibition against shuttles. 
Currently shuttles can operate only from the airport. We need to have all the 
options open; a shuttle system with vans that could take people to work would 
be a much better system of transportation. Public Safety

 I have always felt regarding public safety that there is a tremendous rift 
between a police officer position and pay and a basic security officer 
position. I've always felt there has been a strong need for a second tier of 
police officer, one that does not make as much money as a fully-trained officer 
but definitely much more money than a security officer. 
</P>
<P>
 And I think this could be a second level of police officers that would put 
more officers on the street. These officers would be under the supervision of 
the completely trained police officers. I believe a lot of this has been 
deterred by the power of the police unions, to the detriment of the community.

 I think there are many, many people in Los Angeles who are working for better 
unity and community among all the people in Los Angeles. I was born in Los 
Angeles. I've lived here all my life. My particular interest is in linking 
people together from different ethnic groups. I have taught English as a second 
language at Mt. St. Mary's and I have taught Spanish to English-speaking people 
who want to learn Spanish conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 We have come up with an idea, which is putting two groups of people and 
teaching two languages simultaneously. Language differences and inability to 
communicate are barriers to community building in Los Angeles, whether it be a 
church or a PTA or a neighborhood organization. 
</P>
<P>
 We will have a class where 50% of the people are learning beginning Spanish 
and 50% of the people in the class are learning English. It is a way to get to 
know one another. 
</P>
<P>
 We are planning to have Korean, Vietnamese, English and Spanish be the four 
languages that we co-teach. The carrot is learning the language. The purpose of 
the meetings and of the classes is to make relationships among people who speak 
different languages.

 Media perpetuation of negative stereotyping is insidious; it is powerful 
because it is subtle. It is also tragic: even when seeking solutions, this 
newspaper perpetuates the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 So how can the L.A. Times help lead the way in ending negative stereotyping by 
the media? Start a weekly column about seeing our biases; ask readers to write 
in pointing out the bias they see in the media (especially The Times -- at 
least initially). We will all learn from having the subtle stereotypes made 
more obvious. Once we learn to really see the problem, we can begin to address 
it.

RECALL ELECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In your editorial of Aug. 8, "This Recall Should Be Recalled," relating to 
local recall elections, you expose the financial dilemma that cities face when 
a local recall election requires a subsequent special election. Indeed, your 
editorial cites the recently successful recall election in Fullerton where 
three City Council members were recalled from office.As a result, a special 
election costing the city an estimated $117,000 will be held Oct. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Covina recall and the elapsed time in which recalled City Council 
members were left in charge of millions of dollars of taxpayer funds, I 
introduced and Gov. Pete Wilson signed into law Assembly Bill 2219, which 
requires a general election be held concurrently with a recall election when a 
majority of a council is recalled. This measure becomes effective next January, 
and will greatly reduce the costs to the taxpayers of the affected cities. The 
measure brings local recall procedure in California in line with that of county 
and statewide elections. 
</P>
<P>
 My bill will save local entities huge sums of money in the instances where 
special elections are required following recall elections. More importantly, it 
immediately takes government out of the hands of those individuals that are no 
longer trusted by the citizens who elected them to represent them.

HEALTH REFORM PROPOSALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Congress should defer acting on health care until after the congressional 
recess. This will allow time to read and understand the bills, and for the 
voters at home to express their views to their representatives. This matter is 
much too important to rush a decision without adequate consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 At present no one knows the details. No one knows how much it will cost to 
implement. No one knows where the money will come from. No one knows the 
effects on quality, access, or the economy. It has been said, "The devil is in 
the details." Until we know the details we cannot expect to make a rational 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it possible the supporters of Clinton-type plans hope one can be passed 
through Congress before the people find out how much it costs and how little 
they get?

 Am I seeing double, or do Jesse Jackson (Column Left, Aug. 7) and Harvey

American people get the health system they desire and deserve?": campaign 
contributions by special interests. The politically correct health-care 
"reform" package being considered now is just another child of the mother of 
all issues -- our corrupt and corrupting system of financing elections. 
</P>

 It is time to take a stand for comprehensive campaign finance reform like the

 A letter (July 28) attempts to put the blame for lack of action on Clinton's

If Democrats want this botched attempt at controlling our lives they have the 
votes. They don't need a single Republican vote.

 "Reform Has Been D.O.A. Since Day One" (Commentary, July 29) certainly hit 
home. We have been faithful dues-paying members of Kaiser-Permanente for 15 
years, in the firm belief that we were providing responsibly for our 
health-care needs. What Kaiser didn't treat, we always believed, they would 
cover by referral. Last October, at her doctor's insistence, our daughter 
returned from college in need of emergency hospitalization. Desperate calls to 
Kaiser and frantic consultation with doctors there led us to understand that 
the treatment she needed was not provided at their facilities. Under acute 
pressure, we had her admitted to the appropriate clinic elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, $100,000 in hospital bills later, Kaiser refuses to chip in a single 
penny of the costs. To pursue arbitration we face $20,000 in additional costs. 
Justice, it seems, is a luxury we can't afford. 
</P>
<P>
 When half of middle-class America has a story like ours, then perhaps we'll 
put our minds together to come up with a reasonable solution.

 Lars Erik Nelson's Column Left ("The Deathbed Conversion of the AMA," July 24) 
incorrectly positioned the American Medical Assn. as being in favor of the 
Clinton health-system reform proposal. In addition, the headline didn't reflect 
the substance of the column and was misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 The AMA began its campaign for universal coverage more than four years ago. 
This month we repeated, not initiated, as Nelson implied, our support for 
universal health-care coverage.  
</P>
<P>
 The AMA believes that the proper approach to reforming the health system is a 
blending of employer mandates (for companies with more than 100 employees) and 
individual mandates with appropriate subsidies for low-income wage earners. 
Universal coverage should be phased in with a specific target date. We also 
have called for meaningful health-care liability reform and other 
cost-containment measures, like a reduction in the current system's 
administrative burden. 
</P>
<P>
 Readers should not infer from the article that the AMA is anti-managed care. 
Rather, we are opposed to "managed profits" taking precedence over quality 
patient care. There are many excellent managed-care programs in this country. 
Managed care, along with fee-for-service and other health insurance options, 
should be available to consumers.

TB SCREENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your July 25 editorial suggesting the need for annual tuberculosis screening 
in schools omitted several pertinent facts. 
</P>
<P>
 First, because the TB skin test is imperfect, universal screening would 
incorrectly identify a substantial number of children as infected and, 
therefore, could result in the needless administration of medication to 
uninfected kids.For these reasons, the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention and American Academy of Pediatrics recommend annually screening only 
those children at high risk for TB by virtue of increased exposure to people 
with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, state law allows counties to decide whether to require annual TB skin 
tests for first-time schoolchildren. While Los Angeles is among the counties 
that require TB skin testing of kindergarteners, no county requires annual TB 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, as part of its Strategic Plan for Tuberculosis Control and 
Elimination, the state will be conducting a cost/benefit analysis of TB 
screening in schools. In the meantime, the Wilson Administration is working 
with local officials and health care providers in communities with increased 
incidence of TB to implement the plan's strategies for ensuring prompt 
diagnosis and reporting of cases, completion of appropriate therapy, thorough 
contact investigations and improved education -- all of which are essential to 
halting the spread of TB in California.

YOU'RE PRESIDENT . . . AND THEY'RE NOT; GET UP, DUST YOURSELF OFF, KEEP ON 
GOING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You're William Jefferson Clinton, and you're the President of the United 
States -- heck, the leader of the Western World -- and you've been clobbered. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, with last week's defeat of the crime bill you were handed a thumping by 
Congress. And, yes, you and your staff seem to have made many mistakes in your 
first 20 months. Including losing this one. 
</P>
<P>
 But you're still the President, and you were elected because more people 
thought you were better than anyone else running. So you've got to get up, dust 
yourself off and hold your head high. 
</P>
<P>
 Take comfort in the ups and downs of your predecessors -- hey, how would 
Lincoln have done in the polls if there had been polls? For you've still got 
more than half of your term left, and you can do a lot better than you have 
done so far. Because, among other things, you're basically more intelligent 
than many people in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Try thinking more presidentially. Consider Republicans Bob Dole, the minority 
leader in the Senate, and Robert H. Michel, the minority leader in the House. 
Yes, they are wily fellows, but they are not the President. Better for you to 
always deal with them as the President than as a Democrat. For you are 
President of all the people; they are leaders of the Republicans only. 
</P>
<P>
 You still can be a great President, and many patriotic people hope you will 
prove to be just that. (How many Americans really want to watch another 
presidency unravel?) You have tremendous energy, an enormous appetite for the 
big issues (no one can call a man who tackles a complex issue like health care 
reform a policy wimp) and an obvious desire to make this country better. You've 
got a foreign-policy success in North Korea, putting some luster on your 
Western-leader credential (see editorial at right). It might even lend a 
domestic boost. 
</P>
<P>
 But all along the way you'll need Republicans, for as you've figured out by 
now, too many Democrats are Democrats mainly in name. Some are downright 
provincial, some are oh-so-easily intimidated by monied interest groups like 
the National Rifle Assn. and some on the left are willing to vote against a 
mostly useful measure like the crime bill and deprive constituents of needed 
programs in order to make a political point. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, every triumph, like the NAFTA victory, will be because of 
Republicans as well as Democrats. As a 43%-of-the-voters President, you will 
continually need to harvest consensus. This takes time, this takes patience, 
this takes some Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 It's bipartisan government or no government. Maybe you will get some kind of 
crime bill repackaged this week, maybe you won't. A whole lot of people are 
still rooting for you, whatever the latest poll shows or doesn't show. For you 
are the President and no one else is. Don't lose heart.

A DANGEROUS IMPASSE IS AVOIDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last month, when North Korea's dictator-for-life Kim Il Sung died at 82, 
observers wondered whether the much-anticipated event would prove to be the 
beginning of the end or merely the end of the beginning. Would son Kim Jong Il, 
his successor, establish a government in Pyongyang that would be as difficult, 
unpredictable and menacing as his father's? Or would he seek to nudge this last 
outpost of hard-core communism, with its dilapidated economy and rigid 
secret-police internal controls, into the 20th Century? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is still far from clear, but in Geneva over the weekend, U.S and 
North Korean negotiators reached unprecedented understandings on the dangerous 
nuclear-weapons issue. North Korea, whose secretive nuclear program has been a 
growing source of severe tensions for Seoul, Tokyo, Beijing and Washington, in 
effect says it is willing to terminate any and all ambitions for nuclear 
weapons if in return the West will help it modernize its nuclear-power 
facilities, reduce barriers to trade and investment in North Korea and move 
toward normal diplomatic relations. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials hailed the Geneva development, of course, but perhaps the most 
significant immediate reaction came from South Korea's foreign ministry, which 
called it a move toward "final resolution of the North Korean nuclear program." 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement is certainly far from complete. The issue of the 8,000 spent 
fuel rods that were recently removed from North Korea's secretive nuclear 
complex at Yongbyon obviously needs more work and Washington and Pyongyang only 
agreed to diplomatic baby steps in mutual recognition -- low-level "liaison" 
offices in the two capitals. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Geneva understanding represents a significant step forward -- and 
comes as a tremendous relief to Korean-Americans in the United States, so many 
of whom have family in both North and South Korea. They have watched the 
growing tension and harshly escalating rhetoric between Pyongyang and 
Washington with increasing concern for their relatives in both Koreas. The news 
from Geneva this weekend was cause for celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 The news no doubt had a similar cheering effect on the battle-scarred Clinton 
Administration, reeling from the embarrassing crime-bill vote. The North Korean 
agreement is a clear feather in its cap.

COMMUNITY WATCH; UNKNOWN COMPTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It hasn't been a good week for Compton. Residents of the city of 91,400 south 
of Los Angeles are understandably frustrated and irritated.Like all other 
cities, Compton has its problems . . . but that's all people seem to focus on. 
</P>
<P>
 What attracted the interest of most outside of Compton was a videotape showing 
a city police officer beating a youth. The fact that the officer was an African 
American and the 17-year-old was a Latino has ignited long-festering tensions 
in the racially mixed community, whose power structure is dominated by African 
Americans and whose population is 51% Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton was in the news again last week when Rep. Walter R. Tucker III, the 
city's former mayor, was indicted by a grand jury on charges that he solicited 
and accepted $30,000 in bribes while mayor. He has denied the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Lost amid the headlines are efforts to foster cooperation among the city's 
black and Latino residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton Mayor Omar Bradley is organizing a town hall meeting. The city's lone 
Latino school board trustee, Gorgonio Sanchez, is helping to put together a 
Latino affairs commission. The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has 
offered the help of the county ombudsman and the Human Relations Commission as 
nonpartisan community mediators. And Compton's Catholic and Protestant churches 
are establishing closer ties through the grass-roots Southern California 
Organizing Committee. Too often such efforts get lost in the shadows of what's 
in the news spotlight.

MAYOR RIORDAN'S CLEAN AIR PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the race to meet federal court-imposed mandates to develop a long-term 
regional plan to clean our air, every serious alternative should be considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Your coverage (Aug. 10) of the city's alternative to the region's Air Quality 
Management Plan (AQMP) gives the false impression that I am seeking to delay 
implementation of court-ordered mandates to clean up our air. I am not. 
</P>
<P>
 I have joined the City Council in seeking to delay by 30 days the vote on 
exactly what those regulations will be. 
</P>
<P>
 The City of Los Angeles has developed a framework that will allow us to have 
clean air without the loss of jobs. Our mission in putting forth an alternative 
plan is not to create controversy, and certainly not to delay the fight for 
clean air. 
</P>
<P>
 The alternative plan will achieve the federally-mandated ozone standard, but 
at an annual cost up to $3.2 billion less than the AQMP. 
</P>
<P>
 By mandating use of current technology, our plan provides greater certainty 
that clean air will actually be achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 The alternative plan will allow Southern California industries, including our 
international port and airport, to retain their competitiveness in the global 
marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 We are not looking to have a showdown with the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District board. Rather, the millions of people who live and work in 
Southern California will be better served if we all work together toward our 
common goal of clean air. I am confident that when the SCAQMD has a chance to 
thoroughly review the data we have presented, it will find merit in our 
proposal. It cleans the air, meets federal clean air mandates, saves $3.2 
billion in the process, and will protect an estimated 57,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision on the AQMP is huge. The impact of the approved plan will be felt 
for generations to come. Our plan deserves serious review and consideration.

A CHILD'S LESSON IN CARE-GIVING; DISABILITY: THOSE WHO PROTEST PUTTING DISABLED 
KIDS IN REGULAR CLASSROOMS FAIL TO SEE HOW MUCH THE 'NORMAL' KIDS LEARN FROM 
IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When my daughter Jessica was 4 years old, she attended nursery school with a 
little boy who was disabled. Each morning, she would cry because the boy -- 
we'll call him Johnny -- frightened her. Despite our efforts to reassure her 
and explain Johnny's disability, it was a struggle to get her to go to school 
each day. Once there, it was even more of a struggle to persuade her not to run 
off in tears anytime Johnny came near her. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, she visited a good friend of our family who took Jessica to lunch 
at a neighbor's house. The neighbor had a severely disabled daughter who used a 
wheelchair and uttered incomprehensible sounds. Jessica was again in turmoil. 
After a few minutes, she asked our friend if she could talk with her privately. 
Away from the disabled young woman, she burst into tears and confessed how 
frightened and sad she felt. Could she go into the garden and draw until after 
lunch, she begged? 
</P>
<P>
 It's now one year later -- and Jessica is 7. She is no longer afraid of all 
sick and disabled people. She hasn't grown out of her fears; she has learned 
her way out of them under an "inclusion" program at her public school in 
Arlington, Mass, where a child born with muscular dystrophy was a member of her 
first-grade class. 
</P>
<P>
 In both educational circles and the press, there's been a lot of debate about 
the virtues of including disabled children in America's classrooms. Critics 
cite the expense of hiring assistant teachers to help these disabled children. 
They argue that the presence of children with severe disabilities has a 
negative impact on the "normal" children in the classroom. The subtext is that 
the disabled will learn but the "normal" kids won't. Supporters counter by 
focusing on the benefits that inclusion brings to the disabled children around 
whose social and educational needs these programs have been designed. 
</P>
<P>
 As a parent, I want to argue in favor of inclusion, not only because of the 
help it gives to disabled students but because of the educational and social 
value it has for the rest of the students, like my 7-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 I spent the past year watching all the things that Jessica and her classmates 
learned from their classmate Paula and I am deeply impressed. As Jessica 
explains to anyone who will listen, Paula may not be able to walk or even to 
move anything but her chin, but she certainly can listen, talk and learn. 
Jessie is amazed at how skillfully Paula navigates through the school in a 
200-pound wheelchair that she guides by pushing her chin against a rubber cup. 
In class, a teacher's assistant works with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Paula takes part in all the class activities and even goes to gym. The day I 
came to visit the classroom, my daughter and several other students held up 
Paula's arms when the children were playing "Simon Says." When it was math 
time, teams of three kids were asked to solve problems with movable objects, 
like beads, or beans, or pennies. Paula and Jessica were on a team together and 
they helped each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica has been to Paula's house to play and has marveled at the elevator 
chair that takes her up the stairs and at how Paula is able to play by herself 
and with others. One afternoon, while recounting the "stuff" she did that day, 
my daughter confided that Paula had had an accident and wet her pants in class. 
The tone of voice caught me totally off guard. As if the class had won a 
competition or passed the most exhausting series of exams, she explained that 
not one child laughed or made fun of her. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica is not only comfortable with the details of Paula's illness, she is 
now well versed in the technology necessary to help Paula negotiate life. While 
Paula has been learning, so has my daughter -- about medicine, technology and 
about caring for other human beings. To me, the lessons about care-giving are 
the most important. I have long wondered where, in a society that fears illness 
and disability, vulnerability and dependence, kids can learn to tolerate 
infirmity and to appreciate interdependence. In my daughter's case I am 
thankful to say that she and her classmates are mastering these lessons in 
elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 The other day, Jessica and I were talking about Paula. "You know, Mom," she 
said, "Paula changed that feeling in me of being scared of people who are 
disabled. I don't cry when I'm next to Paula or want to run away. I just keep 
playing with her because she's one of my best friends. Paula changed my life."

PERSPECTIVE ON MEXICO; THE THINKERS' REVOLUTION; SEVENTY PEOPLE OF ALL 
POLITICAL STRIPES ARE PRESSING AN AGENDA FOR DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION; SUNDAY'S 
VOTE IS THE TEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JORGE G. CASTANEDA, Jorge G. Castaneda is a political scientist and longtime 
critic of the PRI and the Salinas government. He hosted the first meetings of 
Grupo San Angel. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It might appear surprising, or even outrageous, to state that Mexico's 
upcoming presidential election, being touted as the most crucial, contested and 
clean vote in the country's history, is not really very important. Yet that is 
precisely the point emerging from one of the most innovative phenomena of the 
current campaign: A new, broad-based group of concerned citizens has been 
trying, with some success, to impress upon the political Establishment that 
next Sunday's election is only a starting point, a necessary first step but not 
a sufficient condition for democratic transition in a country where democracy 
has yet to see the light of day. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition of academics, writers, union leaders and former Cabinet 
officials, which has come to be known as Grupo San Angel, for the traditional 
cobblestoned neighborhood of Mexico City where its first meetings were held, 
has its origins in a series of grass-roots and intellectual undertakings that 
sprang forth in Mexico over the past few years. But it was the unease or open 
frustration that developed throughout Mexico as a result of the Chiapas 
uprising and the assassination of candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio that gave 
impetus to the formation of Grupo San Angel in early June. It has since met 
with and had open, free-wheeling discussions -- informal, usually over lunch at 
members' homes -- with the three leading presidential candidates, Cuauhtemoc 
Cardenas, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos and Ernesto Zedillo, and with President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari and Interior Minister (and chief electoral official) 
Jorge Carpizo.Last week, it met with a small number of Mexico's wealthiest and 
most powerful businessmen, and is negotiating an encounter with the Zapatistas 
in Chiapas.  
</P>
<P>
 Because of the high profile of members and guests, the group has received a 
torrential volume of publicity and become something of a household word, at 
least among the political and intellectual elites. So much so that some suspect 
-- falsely, without question -- that only an enterprise inspired by and managed 
by Salinas himself could emerge so spectacularly in such a short time. 
</P>
<P>
 Grupo San Angel includes writers, such as Carlos Fuentes, Laura Esquivel and 
Paco Ignacio Taibo II; historians, such as Enrique Krauze and Lorenzo Meyer; 
former Cabinet members and PRI sympathizers, such as former Foreign Minister 
Bernardo Sepulveda, former Finance Minister David Ibarra, former PRI leader 
(and Salinas' 1988 campaign manager) Enrique Gonzalez Pedrero; labor leaders, 
such as Elba Esther Gordillo, head of the 1 million-member teachers' union; and 
social activists, such as Father Gonzalo Ituarte, vicar of San Cristobal de las 
Casas in Chiapas. The political opposition is represented by Cardenas 
sympathizers, such as Adolfo Aguilar Zinser and Amalia Garcia, and National 
Action Party heavyweights, such as Vicente Fox, who ran for governor of 
Guanajuato in 1991. It is the first such collection of political currents, 
ideological preferences and professional diversity in recent Mexican history 
that actually acts together, instead of simply signing manifestoes. It is, as 
some critics say, elitist, but this is, unfortunately, inevitable in a country 
where politics has always been a occupation for elites only. Elitist attempts 
to transform the traditional features of Mexico's politics have tended to 
perpetuate those features. 
</P>
<P>
 Grupo San Angel, reflecting the country's desperation for democracy, is 
determined to succeed on its two basic purposes: to contribute to as clean and 
widely accepted an electoral process as possible; and to broker an agreement 
among the three main candidates on what will happen after Sunday, thereby 
defusing the tension surrounding the election itself. It has achieved partial 
success on both counts, but so far has not been able to accomplish all of what 
it set out to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the election procedures, the group formulated an initial set of 
recommendations, which were read to President Salinas on July 18. These 
included opening up the terribly biased mass media to debate and talk shows on 
the main national issues of the day; reducing the number of polling precincts 
by two-thirds, thereby allowing opposition parties to watch all of them; 
posting electoral rolls outside voting booths two weeks before the elections so 
that voters could check for themselves whether they were actually registered; 
removing a large percentage of district and state election officials, who 
continue to be government-party appointees and notoriously dishonest; and 
instructing the new, independent and consensus-based Federal Election Council 
to issue an opinion immediately before and after the vote on the cleanliness of 
the entire process and the accuracy of the result. 
</P>
<P>
 The group believed that if these suggestions were heeded, most if not all of 
the pending points of dispute would be laid to rest, and the main candidates 
would then consider the elections to be free and fair. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations were only partially accepted, and part of the still highly 
questioned character of the electoral process stems from this incomplete 
acceptance. The number of precincts was not reduced; the electoral rolls were 
posted only in public buildings -- that is, in only 4,000 places, instead of 
the 96,000 voting sites; the TV programs were broadcast, but not in prime time; 
the local officials were not fully substituted; the election council has not 
yet agreed to speak out on the quality of the process. 
</P>
<P>
 The group felt that the reasons -- mainly of a technical or timely nature -- 
given for only partial compliance were understandable but not persuasive. 
Indeed, the difficulties involved seemed manageable; the timing obstacle, 
however, is both the creation and the burden of the president and his party. 
They have come around to contemplating a clean election now that it may be too 
late to hold one.

DOMENIGONI: A DAM SITE TOO EXPENSIVE; MWD: A HUGE NEW RESERVOIR WOULD COST $2 
BILLION, BUT WATER TO FILL IT IS PROBLEMATIC AND THERE ARE CHEAPER 
ALTERNATIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOROTHY GREEN, Dorothy Green founded Heal the Bay and is a former Department 
of Water and Power commissioner. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Water District is undertaking a historic and remarkably open 
assessment of its water supply and demand projections to determine how best to 
meet Southern California's water needs for the next 20 years and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 This assessment has made clear that a $2-billion construction program to build 
a new reservoir in the Domenigoni Valley in Riverside County is not needed: The 
water to fill it will not be there. Adequate storage is already available in 
Southern California to protect against drought and aqueduct failure. There are 
many underutilized local water supplies that are just now being evaluated. 
</P>
<P>
 Domenigoni Reservoir is being designed to store water from Northern 
California, water that is now in short supply. As the full implications of the 
Endangered Species Act and the means needed to protect and restore the San 
Francisco Bay Delta are finally determined, this supply will only shrink 
further. There may be surplus water during very wet years -- one year or two in 
seven -- for the reservoir. MWD may purchase water from agriculture to fill the 
reservoir, but we already have enormous unused storage capacity in Southern 
California. And there are no evaporative losses from underground aquifers. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent MWD report documents 2.6 million acre feet of storage in our Southern 
California aquifers, more than triple the proposed storage capacity of 
Domenigoni. This storage capacity is not evenly distributed beneath member 
agencies' communities, and there are insufficient physical connections and no 
negotiated agreements so that the member agencies could jointly benefit from 
this capacity. In fact, those who manage our aquifers met together for the 
first time only this past spring to talk about how to work together. Solving 
these institutional constraints is much cheaper, though maybe not easier, than 
the very expensive engineered solution planned.  
</P>
<P>
 The cost of Domenigoni, and for some needed water-quality improvements, is 
tripling the wholesale cost of water this decade. This increase is already 
causing many member agencies and subagencies to look for alternatives to MWD to 
meet local needs. Many alternatives are available, starting with using what we 
have much more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say that MWD can easily conserve and reuse more than twice its current 
projections. Some member agencies are doing a good job of replacing 
old-fashioned flush toilets that use as much as 7 gallons per flush with 
1.6-gallon-per-flush models at a cost lower than the current wholesale cost of 
MWD water. Some have not begun, just as some are not yet taking seriously the 
enormous potential for reclamation and reuse. Nor has the impact of the 
increasing cost of water on people's choice of landscaping materials been 
evaluated. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm yield that can be developed by using surface water supplies in 
conjunction with ground water is now under study, as is the potential for 
developing local ground water that is too high in dissolved solids to be 
potable. It is much easier to remove these solids than to desalinate sea water. 
</P>
<P>
 As the wholesale cost of water continues to escalate, local supplies look 
better and better. Beverly Hills is drilling new exploratory wells after having 
closed down its old wells years ago. Burbank is talking about getting off MWD 
water altogether. Other agencies are working to develop their ground water in 
conjunction with agencies without ground water who are not even neighbors, 
demanding that MWD's pipelines be made available to move the water. These and 
other creative ideas are just beginning to surface, showing that local water 
agencies prefer to invest in reducing demand and in their own local supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 As these local supplies are developed, MWD will sell less water, causing the 
fixed costs of an expensive reservoir to be spread over fewer customers, 
raising the cost of MWD water even higher and stimulating further development 
of local resources. Since MWD's member agencies have not yet committed to 
paying for the huge new dam -- what they call an insurance policy -- and given 
the uncertainty about the supply to fill it and the underdeveloped storage and 
local supplies in Southern California, the only responsible course is to 
re-evaluate Domenigoni now, before any more money is spent. This project is 
just too expensive, the supply to fill the dam isn't there and there are 
cheaper alternatives.

STOP THE SLIDE IN CORPORATE PHILANTHROPY; CHARITY: THE AID OFTEN ACCOMPLISHES 
WHAT GOVERNMENT CAN'T, AND BUSINESS AND THE COMMUNITY GET A STRONGER BASE.

 The recent decision by Arco to substantially cut its foundation staff and 
reduce its community donations is part of a disturbing national trend in 
corporate philanthropy. Recent data show no overall growth in corporate giving 
and reductions by many companies and industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Reversing this trend obviously concerns nonprofit organizations, the apparent 
beneficiaries. But it should be of equal concern to corporate and government 
leaders and the general public. The diminished involvement of corporate 
foundations in civic and community affairs undermines corporate interests as 
well as the national movement to reinvent government and to shore up the 
nation's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate foundations and giving programs have a distinctive role in 
philanthropy. Combined with the contributions of family, religious and 
community foundations, they bring a corporate discipline to grant-making. The 
ability to turn benevolence into a business produces high yields for 
shareholders and the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The field of affordable housing illustrates how community problems are 
well-served by corporate involvement. The federal low-income housing tax-credit 
program allows corporations tax credits in exchange for investments in 
affordable housing, providing shareholders considerable returns from tax 
savings. These, however, are typically not passive investments. Corporate 
foundations play an active role in the creation of the program and continue to 
protect corporate shareholder interests. Corporate grants programs provide the 
critical operating support, capacity building and gap financing for 
affordable-housing developers.  
</P>
<P>
 The impact of this results-oriented approach to charity on reinventing 
government is startling. Corporate investments and contributions are doing the 
work that government has been unable to do alone. The National Journal recently 
reported that $425 million in tax-credit allocations in 1993 is expected to 
produce about 100,000 housing units. By contrast, the 1994 government 
appropriation of more than $500 million for public housing is expected to yield 
fewer than 7,000 new units. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Arco Foundation's collapse presages a swift and irreversible downward 
spiral in corporate participation in community affairs, either taxpayers will 
pay or vulnerable groups will suffer, or both. 
</P>
<P>
 In a shrinking economy with fewer discretionary funds, corporate foundations 
still play a critical role in community and economic affairs. These foundations 
can offer considerable intellectual capital to national concerns about poverty 
and economic growth. The Arco Foundation, as co-chair of a working group of 
public and private funders, community organizations and economists, helped lead 
a research effort to link the growth industries in Los Angeles to low-income 
residents and communities. The goal was to find strategic ways to make 
distressed communities economically viable and in turn shore up the region's 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 With a small grant and its joint leadership in an 18-month planning process, 
the foundation helped attract $2.5 million in funding from the National 
Community Development Initiative, a consortium of national foundations and HUD. 
These funds helped launch an initiative designed to improve health services and 
provide health-related jobs and business opportunities in distressed 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arco Foundation's corporate clout and business know-how leveraged scarce 
corporate resources, attracted national funds to local concerns and, more 
important, worked to build a stronger business climate for its own bottom-line 
concerns. This is smart grant-making, good business and it benefits the entire 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporations are key participants in building effective partnerships to tackle 
seemingly intractable urban problems. Communities can't do it alone, and 
government doesn't always do it well. Collaborative efforts provide new 
opportunities for joint problem-solving, risk-sharing and for achieving greater 
impact and scale. Reducing corporate philanthropy runs the risk of leaving the 
important leadership and service components of corporations to caprice and 
neglect.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Lodwrick M. Cook, Arco's chairman, said it best. In June, 1993, Cook 
wrote: "I hope that you will see our social investments as I do -- as a 
commitment to our friends, neighbors and customers and as seed money to 
encourage workers of small, important miracles." We call on corporate America 
to not only maintain but to strengthen its leadership role in reinventing 
society and renewing hope. Let us hope its shareholders and the general public 
will do so as well.

 Arab Banks Reopen in Wake of Peace Accords: The first Egyptian bank branch 
since Israel captured the West Bank during the Six Day War in 1967 has received 
a license to reopen in the West Bank town of Bethlehem, the Bank of Israel 
said.The Egyptian-Jordanian Arab Land Bank will open for business in the same 
building it occupied in the town of Bethlehem prior to 1967. Locally owned 
Commercial Bank of Palestine was due to open a branch in Ramallah today, 
according to Bank of Israel spokesman Yoav Lehmann. "Slowly, a whole financial

STREET SMART / AARON CURTISS: HE'S NOT JUST ANOTHER MOTORMOUTH

 Public access television is crowded with the libidinous chatter of sex 
priestesses and the monotonous drivel of wanna-be Regis Philbins. But on 
occasional Saturdays, Kenny Morse breaks this idiocy with his alter ego, Mr. 
Traffic, a fast-talking showman who knows more than seems healthy about the 
rules of the road. 
</P>
<P>
 He is hard to miss, his manic monologues and hokey sets knocking even the most 
adept channel surfer off balance. His "Ask Mr. Traffic" is among the most 
popular public access cable television shows in Los Angeles County, drawing a 
few thousand motorheads each time it airs, usually on Saturday afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
 The phone lines are jammed minutes into the half-hour show, their lights 
twinkling in furious cadence. All want the ear and the advice of Morse, a 
flamboyant former actor who landed by accident in the traffic safety racket 
eight years ago and fell in love. 
</P>
<P>
 Morse still longs for big-time glitz. But if he ever made it on stage at the 
Oscars he'd probably warn folks to buckle up for the drive home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll go to the opening of an envelope if I can promote traffic safety," said 
Morse, 41, who by day works as a traffic school instructor. "I am flagrantly 
self-promotional." 
</P>
<P>
 His spartan set at the Century Cable studios in Santa Monica includes a 
prominent display of a recent award for best cable call-in show. "It looks 
nice," he explained. He puts out his own newsletter full of traffic tips. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the hype, Morse's Mr. Traffic knows his stuff. On a live show 
recently, Morse -- nattily dressed in black suit, blue shirt and no tie -- 
breezily answered questions from callers ranging from what to do about an 
undeserved parking ticket to whether tinted windows are legal. 
</P>
<P>
 Morse's 4-year-old show is a hammy, intelligent tour through the hinterlands 
of the 975-page California Vehicle Code. 
</P>
<P>
 He sometimes seems to have read every page. In his four years on the air, he 
claims to have been stumped by a caller's question only once: A caller wanted 
to know if it was possible to declare bankruptcy to escape paying a traffic 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Morse, who subsequently researched the topic, the answer is yes, 
but he would not recommend it. 
</P>
<P>
 Morse is all show, but his message is all business: Driving in Southern 
California can be tricky, so be careful. Sometimes he seems almost too sincere 
to be sincere, but his passion for safe driving is apparent. He jokes with his 
callers but never talks down to them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Why else would someone spend years boning up not only on California's traffic 
laws but on those of other states and other countries as well? "I have to know 
more than anybody else," Morse said. 
</P>
<P>
 It shows. His first call on a recent show is from Jared, who hit the car in 
front of him during a sneeze. "What's the modus operandi for sneezing on the 
freeway?" Jared asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tailgating is the No. 1 cause of accidents," Morse said, explaining to Jared 
that it was not his sneeze but his proximity to the other vehicle that got him 
in trouble. "You should have had enough space in front of you." 
</P>
<P>
 Another call came from Joe, who had not been ticketed in years but then got 
popped for cutting off a police car. "Does this sound familiar?" Morse asked, 
turning on the siren of a toy police car on his desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, it did, Joe confessed. But he wanted to know why his fine was so high. 
"Because the state is broke," Morse responded, urging angry motorists to vote 
out of office politicians who try to balance their budgets on the backs of 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob wanted to know why his girlfriend was pulled over for driving with tinted 
windows. "That is a cop magnet," Morse explained. "Take it off, it ain't 
legal." 
</P>
<P>
 (It is legal in Arizona, Morse noted later.) 
</P>
<P>
 Dan complained about a parking ticket he got in San Francisco for not parking 
with his tires turned toward the curb. "It wasn't very fair," Dan began. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fair?" Morse interrupted. "Your mother told you life was fair?" He then 
explained that Dan should pay the ticket because he should have obeyed the law. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Traffic safety was not the vocation Morse dreamed about as a kid. He was born 
for show business.  
</P>
<P>
 He worked in production at 20th Century Fox, but was "between jobs" when a 
friend suggested he teach comedy traffic school for some extra cash. He did. It 
suited him. 
</P>
<P>
 His students took to calling him Mr. Traffic. The name stuck. He, in turn, 
began addressing his students as Mr. and Ms. Violator. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Traffic hit the airwaves with appearances on local radio and television 
shows, but none wanted him as a regular feature. So he started his own show on 
public access. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience is small, made up mostly of channel grazers who meander through 
the airwaves in search of something to watch. Morse believes he has about three 
seconds to lure them in. 
</P>
<P>
 To do it, his desk is littered with children's toys. A helicopter. An 
ambulance. A Highway Patrol cruiser. A traffic light that blinks red, yellow 
and green. "Glitz," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
 And though he has more experience with stoplights than spotlights, Mr. Traffic 
has found his niche. "I have a cult following," he said. He gets recognized in 
grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
 He practices what he preaches too. He drives 61 m.p.h. on the freeways, the 
fastest he says it is safe to drive and not get a ticket. His last ticket was 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 His last traffic accident? 
</P>
<P>
 "Last week," he concedes, explaining that someone rear-ended his Honda Civic, 
knocking it into the car in front of him. "It shows that even Mr. Traffic is 
not immune."

DOCTOR'S LICENSE IS SUSPENDED FOR 1 YEAR BY MEDICAL BOARD; ABORTION: A WOMEN'S 
GROUP SAYS THE PENALTY IS TOO LENIENT FOR PHYSICIAN CHARGED WITH INCOMPETENCE 
IN TWO DEATHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Medical Board of California ordered a one-year license suspension for a 
Los Angeles doctor accused of gross negligence and incompetence in the deaths 
of two young women who underwent abortions at his clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 The board also placed Dr. Leo F. Kenneally on 10 years' probation, following 
the recommendation of a Los Angeles administrative law judge who reviewed the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 But the disciplinary action fell far short of the license revocation 
originally sought by state authorities, and drew immediate criticism from a 
group that works on behalf of women who are victims of medical malpractice. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ruling issued last week, medical board members agreed with 
Administrative Law Judge Milford A. Maron in suspending Kenneally for a year -- 
and allowing him to continue providing medical services at his clinics in 
Central Los Angeles and Pacoima until Sept. 9, when the sanction goes into 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the medical board and Kenneally could not be reached for comment 
Sunday. But the doctor's attorney, Jay N. Hartz, called the board's decision a 
"significant victory." 
</P>
<P>
 "The decision acknowledges that Dr. Kenneally is an extremely valuable asset 
to this community," Hartz said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the complaint filed by the state attorney general's office, 
Kenneally failed to properly care for a 22-year-old asthmatic woman who 
suffered a seizure during an abortion in 1986. Instead of "appropriately 
managing her life-threatening emergency," Kenneally continued to perform the 
abortion, the complaint alleged. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman was later transported to an area hospital, where she was pronounced 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint also alleged that the doctor failed to quickly call paramedics 
when an 18-year-old woman stopped breathing and went into cardiac arrest while 
undergoing an abortion in 1987. The woman was admitted to a hospital, where she 
died 58 days later. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general's office also accused Kenneally of mishandling five other 
abortions that resulted in injuries between 1988 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In his May 27 ruling, Maron agreed that Kenneally was negligent in the deaths 
of the two women. But the administrative judge stated that there were 
mitigating factors that warranted not permanently revoking the license of the 
doctor, who operates Her Medical Clinics at 2700 S. Figueroa St. and at 13309 
Van Nuys Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 One mitigating factor, Maron stated, was that Kenneally provides affordable 
abortions in poor neighborhoods underserved by the medical community. 
</P>
<P>
 "The weight of the evidence demonstrates that (Kenneally) is an unselfish and 
committed provider," Maron wrote. "There is presently an enormous need for his 
services in the communities which he serves, where he is the 'price floor' for 
elective abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 "His absence would make it much more difficult for disadvantaged women to 
obtain such services." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also said the doctor has performed about 100,000 abortions over the 
past 10 years and is viewed by his professional colleagues as a "skilled and 
innovative provider." 
</P>
<P>
 But the ruling was condemned Sunday by the leader of the Los-Angeles based 
Women's Advocate group, which is active in medical issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (board's) decision makes absolutely no sense, except that you can 
conclude the medical board does not care about consumer protection," Director 
Jeannette Dreisbach said. "The scales of justice are very, very unbalanced 
here."

MALIBU BOY PULLED TO SAFETY AFTER FALLING INTO HOLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 11-year-old Malibu boy was rescued from a 40-foot-deep shaft at a 
construction site after he fell into the hole during a dirt bike excursion near 
his home in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter Roberts was in fair condition after being trapped for about 90 minutes 
in the 2-foot-wide hole. 
</P>
<P>
 A team of rescuers lifted him out by lowering a paramedic into the shaft. 
</P>
<P>
 The paramedic attached a harness to the boy; both were then pulled out. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter, who was conscious throughout the ordeal and able to talk with 
rescuers, was taken by helicopter to UCLA Medical Center complaining of pain in 
his left shoulder and back, said Los Angeles County Fire Department spokesman 
Bob Brandelli. 
</P>
<P>
 A hospital spokeswoman said that Hunter was in fair condition and that he had 
been admitted for observation. 
</P>
<P>
 As the boy was being moved on a stretcher to the helicopter, his mother, 
Christa Roberts, said she was "incredibly relieved." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very lucky," she said, holding back tears. "He's like a cat with nine 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters were notified at 11:40 a.m. that the boy had slipped down the 
hole on an empty lot on Sweetwater Mesa Road, less than two miles north of 
Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The hole apparently had been bored for geological testing, said Kevin Ryan of 
the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department's Malibu Mountain Rescue Unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandelli said the boy and a 10-year-old friend were riding motorized dirt 
bikes on the site, an empty lot at the end of a dirt road that apparently is 
being prepared for home construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has all the fun little tricks," Brandelli said of the lot, which has small 
hills and trenches. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan said Hunter and his friend were removing a piece of plywood with the 
words "Keep Out" that covered the hole, hoping to use it as a ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hunter fell in. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Capt. John Dishaw of Station 88 in Malibu said firefighters were able to 
talk with the boy when they arrived, then lowered a flashlight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was dark in the hole, so we wanted to give him some light to help comfort 
him," Dishaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 A county hazardous materials team provided an air hose that was lowered into 
the hole to provide fresh air. 
</P>
<P>
 A hoisting system with pulleys was set up to lower paramedic John Haugh into 
the hole. Haugh then slipped a harness around the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Haugh said the rescue was made easier because of the boy's small size and 
because the boy's arms were free to don the harness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only had a few inches to work with, but it really helped that he was able 
to communicate with me," Haugh said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lucked out," added Ryan.

ARMENIAN PRESIDENT GETS ENTHUSIASTIC WELCOME; POLITICS: LEVON TER-PETROSSIAN, 
COUNTRY'S FIRST POPULARLY ELECTED LEADER, ARRIVES ON A MISSION TO STRENGTHEN 
ECONOMIC TIES WITH U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The first popularly elected leader of an independent Armenia arrived Sunday 
for a three-day visit with political and business leaders in Southern 
California -- home to one of the world's largest Armenian communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Levon Ter-Petrossian, who was elected in 1991 after Armenia gained its 
independence for the first time in 600 years, is on a seven-day visit to 
strengthen economic ties between his embattled republic and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Ter-Petrossian met with President Clinton and made stops in Boston and Detroit 
before arriving here, where he was greeted by hundreds of well-wishers as well 
as Mayor Richard Riordan and other dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
 His arrival touched off cheers, shouts, whistling and applause that lasted 
from the moment he stepped from his private jet until he got into his 
limousine. He was given armloads of roses by two students from a Hollywood 
Armenian school who had waited or over an hour on the boiling Tarmac, clad in 
ankle-length traditional dancing dresses of red and green velvet. 
</P>
<P>
 Ter-Petrossian and his wife, Ludmila, made a brief midday visit to a Westside 
Armenian church. He addressed about 10,000 Armenian Americans on Sunday night 
in a 90-minute speech at the Los Angeles Convention Center, in which he 
outlined recent economic reforms in Armenia and declared himself impressed that 
so many Armenian immigrants here want to learn more about their native country 
and its recent independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherever he went, the political leader, who is also an expert in the 
authenticity of ancient texts, was greeted as a hero by Armenians, for whom he 
embodies the centuries-long dream of independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who braved 100-degree-plus temperatures at the airport were John 
and Rose Ketchoyian of Sherman Oaks, whose grandparents were among more than 
1.5 million Armenians killed by the Turks between 1915 and 1923. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S.-born Ketchoyians, like many Armenians, have strong emotional ties to 
the country of their forebears. "Whether it was hot or cold, we'd still be out 
here," John Ketchoyian said. "Armenia is trying to get established as a country 
and we're here to support him the best we can." 
</P>
<P>
 "Armenia is our country," said Rose Ketchoyian, adding that she would go there 
"at the drop of a hat" to assist in its recovery.  
</P>
<P>
 Ter-Petrossian's trip comes during a cease-fire in the conflict with adjacent 
Azerbaijan that has crippled the Armenian economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not officially at war, Armenia has supported the breakaway of the 
Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan. That conflict has claimed 
more than 15,000 lives. 
</P>
<P>
 In retaliation, Azerbaijan shut down oil pipelines and overland trade routes 
that Armenia depends on.  
</P>
<P>
 If the July 27 cease-fire agreement holds and peace can be achieved, officials 
hope those lifelines can be reopened so the country won't have to endure 
another brutal winter with only an hour or two of heat and electricity each 
day. Moreover, peace would set the stage for Armenia's industrial renewal, 
generating opportunities for foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Krikor Greg Tashjian, of Glendale, said he has been receiving upbeat reports 
on the situation from his brother, a government energy official in Armenia. 
Tashjian said his brother thinks very highly of Ter-Petrossian, who he said is 
"the right man for the mission" of rebuilding the former Soviet republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Many said Ter-Petrossian has pushed for privatizing farms and industries 
despite the war, the blockade and the devastating 1988 earthquake, which forced 
the shutdown of the nation's nuclear plants out of safety concerns.  
</P>
<P>
 But economic aid will be needed to reopen Armenia's nuclear plants and rebuild 
its industries. 
</P>
<P>
 On this trip, Ter-Petrossian and his delegation met with officials from the 
World Bank, which agreed to help restore the country's irrigation system and 
its reactors.

WORD CUP OF SCRABBLE UNDER WAY; TOURNAMENT: THREE HUNDRED PLAYERS COMPETE IN 
UNIVERSAL CITY FOR TOP PRIZE OF $15,000 AND NATIONAL TITLE.

</P>
<P>
 Three hundred avid Scrabble players -- lawyers, dancers, psychologists, 
cabdrivers -- from as far away as Thailand arrived here to play in the 1994 
National Scrabble championship, the 10th biennial event that kicked off Sunday 
at the Universal Hilton Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 And if they share one thing, it's that they take their words to heart. They 
memorize word lists in their spare time, practice against computerized Scrabble 
programs and study flash cards for hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tournament Scrabble players take this event as seriously as football players 
take the Rose Bowl," said John Williams, National Scrabble Assn. executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 Contestants will compete in 27 rounds through Thursday for a first-place prize 
of $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 About 33 million recreational Scrabble players live in the United States and 
Canada. Among them are more than 10,000 members of nearly 200 clubs, which meet 
weekly. There are 22 clubs in California. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's event has attracted participants from clubs in Israel, England, 
Canada and Thailand. Some arrived as early as Wednesday to prepare for the 
competition, playing six hours a day and brushing up on their dictionary 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was born in 1931, during the Depression, when an out-of-work New York 
architect combined anagrams and crossword puzzles in a board game. He called it 
"Criss Cross Words." After World War II, it was marketed as Scrabble. 
</P>
<P>
 Tournament play is divided into beginner, intermediate and expert categories. 
The most points scored in a single tournament game, 770, was chalked up last 
year by Mark Landsberg of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-time national Scrabble champion Joe Edley, who traveled from Long Island 
for this year's event, has been an avid Scrabbler since 1978. He now works for 
the association as director of clubs, and plays the game against a computer in 
his spare time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy the challenge of taking a whole bunch of letters all jumbled up and 
making them into words," said Edley, the only player to win the national 
championship twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Many players say the best part of Scrabble is "bluffing," when an opponent 
uses a bogus word. Sometimes players get away with it. But if there's a doubt, 
a challenge is called and a word expert searches in an official "Scrabble 
Players Dictionary." 
</P>
<P>
 "I play for the enjoyment of matching knowledge with wits," said Gwen Bishop, 
a 73-year-old player from Eagle Rock who began playing Scrabble as a youngster. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best thing about Scrabble is that anyone, any age can play," said Beth 
Fleischer of Hacienda Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 For such players, Williams said, "This event is our World Cup soccer and 
Woodstock all rolled into one."

2 BODIES RECOVERED FROM CRASH OF FIREFIGHTING PLANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From a Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
 The bodies of two crew members from a C-130 firefighting airplane that 
exploded in mid-air were recovered Sunday from a rugged canyon south of 
Palmdale, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators at the scene Sunday hiked out with the bodies, said Capt. Dean 
Gilmore of the Los Angeles County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board launched a probe of 
Saturday's crash, which killed three crew members on board the four-engine 
tanker. The body of the third crew member had not yet been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 The C-130 took off from Hemet on Saturday afternoon to help battle a 75-acre 
blaze in Kern County. It crashed in a remote area in the Angeles National 
Forest, according to officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the plane, which was carrying fire retardant chemicals, was 
rocked by three explosions before it went down. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane and its crew were from the Hemet Valley Flying Service, which was 
contracted to the U.S National Forest Service, authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
 Two small fires were ignited by the crash.

MIKE DOWNEY: FINALLY, A HIT FOR MOTOWN RAPPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Back when I lived in Michigan, there was this shy little girl from the Detroit 
suburbs who seemed destined to make it big. No, not Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
 Her name was (and still is) Amy Frazier and she was always popping up 
somewhere, dominating junior competition, dragging that huge racket around like 
a guitar. Every weekend, someone would call in with her scores -- Amy Frazier 
advanced here, Amy Frazier qualified there. Around Motown in those days, Aaron 
Krickstein was the teen sensation of tennis and Amy Frazier was the preteen 
sensation. 
</P>
<P>
 She hailed from pleasant Rochester Hills and began hitting backhands at the 
ripe old age of 3, a prodigy before she was tall enough to see over a net. She 
was part Tonya Harding (the good part) and part Jodie Foster, someone who found 
her calling very early in life and evidently never found anything she liked 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 Did she make it big? 
</P>
<P>
 Mmmm, yeah, she did, but it could be she is ready to make it bigger. At a 
tournament that included Wimbledon champions past and present, Martina 
Navratilova and Conchita Martinez, the winner Sunday in straight sets was, 
indeed, Amy Frazier, who was overdue. She smoked Ann Grossman in a Virginia 
Slims final, 6-1, 6-3, during which both players avoided the net as though it 
were laced with barbed wire. 
</P>
<P>
 Nice to be back reporting Amy's scores again. Now 21 and a journeywoman of the 
pro tour, Frazier had not won a pro tournament in this country since 1990. This 
year alone, her only second-place finishes had come in those hotbeds of tennis, 
Lucerne, Switzerland, and Oklahoma City, Okla., two towns almost never 
mentioned in the same sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 I had to search the tour's guide hard for pertinent Amy Frazier information. 
</P>
<P>
 "Favorite color is blue," her biography actually includes. 
</P>
<P>
 The record book also dutifully reports that in 1993, while playing team tennis 
for the Newport Beach Dukes, the exact actual earnings for Amy Frazier came to 
$3,609, an amount probably spent by Navratilova during the weekend on ski wax. 
</P>
<P>
 It goes on to explain that Frazier was unable to play tennis for six months of 
last year, from February until the U.S. Open, because of a "chronic case of the 
flu." Please forgive me for making light of someone's illness, but this must 
have been the worst case of flu since careless germ-spreading missionaries 
wiped out entire Amazon tribes. 
</P>
<P>
 With another U.S. Open coming right up, however, Frazier has seldom looked or 
felt better, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 She frustrated her longtime friend, the enjoyably animated and topspin-happy 
Grossman, to win an 80-grand first prize, never once leaving the baseline 
except to shake hands after the match. Frazier served 10 m.p.h. harder and 
easily overcame her opponent's methodical, no-risk tennis, whereas Grossman, 
who had made wonderful comebacks all week, gradually sensed that this was not 
to be her day, accepting her fate gracefully. 
</P>
<P>
 At face value, Frazier vs. Grossman did come across as Who's She vs. Never 
Heard of Her, and I must admit that my first instinct was to avoid this 
all-Jane Doe final, stripped as it was of the big names. Then suddenly I 
realized that no, that was the beauty of it. These were two fresh faces who 
were finally getting their day in the sun, two deserving women to whom the 
prize money would do more than pay for Lear-jet fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier downplayed that part. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this the most you've won?" someone asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most what?" Amy asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money -- $80,000." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, yeah," she said. "Is that the question?" 
</P>
<P>
 Not much of one, but yeah, how's it feel? 
</P>
<P>
 But Frazier has been playing for too long to be playing only for money. She 
gave a matter-of-fact shrug and said, "It doesn't even enter into it. I play 
tennis because I love to play tennis. I never even thought about the money. I 
didn't know until they said after the match how much it was." 
</P>
<P>
 She is hardly a pauper, and tennis has taken her around the world. Today in 
Japan, where she once defeated Monica Seles indoors, Frazier is more prominent 
and publicly recognized than she is in the United States. Even with her triumph 
at Manhattan Beach, and even with the superstars of women's tennis dropping 
like flies, Frazier is not likely to be mentioned among the favorites, or 
possibly even among the contenders, for the championship at Flushing Meadow. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. Open's two weeks away," she said, as though that was too far off to 
think about. 
</P>
<P>
 But I suspect she's ready. 
</P>
<P>
 She's been preparing for it since she was 3.

A QUICK KNOCKOUT FOR FRAZIER; TENNIS: SHE DEFEATS GROSSMAN, 6-1, 6-3, IN 
64-MINUTE FINAL AT MANHATTAN BEACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The New Age of women's tennis dawned Sunday in Manhattan Beach, and it looked 
. . . . antiquated. 
</P>
<P>
 With styles lacking the charisma of the sport's stars, Amy Frazier and Ann 
Grossman were resigned to pound away from the baseline for 64 minutes in the 
final of the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the points were counted, it was Frazier, 21, from Rochester Hills, 
Mich., who had the better shots in a 6-1, 6-3 victory before 6,214 at the 
Manhattan Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is a very one-dimensional player but she is very good at it," Grossman 
said of her childhood friend. 
</P>
<P>
 That much was evident during the Manhattan Beach event, which ended with a 
demonstration of '70s tennis. Frazier did not drop a set in five matches with 
the best performance of her career. Whether her crisp, deep strokes will be as 
effective at the U.S. Open, which starts Aug. 29, not even Frazier could guess. 
</P>
<P>
 But some supporters are optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we can look back and say this was a breakthrough," said her coach, 
John Cook of Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman, 23, from Grove City, Ohio, believes that it will be for both. They 
developed their smooth-stroking games on the junior circuit in the Midwest, 
where they met as skinny-legged kids with oversized rackets. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Grossman is facing one hurdle Frazier has leaped. She has yet to win a 
final in seven tries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know," she said of losing another opportunity. "I guess someone needs to 
break a leg." 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing Frazier broke was Grossman's serve. 
</P>
<P>
 By going up two breaks in three games in the first set, Frazier's confidence 
soared. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the last thing Grossman wanted to happen. Although she had won four 
consecutive matches after dropping the first set, Grossman knew it would be 
difficult to shake Frazier. 
</P>
<P>
 And the more she tried to motivate herself by talking to her racket, kicking 
the court siding and screaming, the more Frazier's confidence grew. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth game of the second set, Grossman fell behind, 0-30, on serve, 
and yelled: "My grandmother can play better than this." 
</P>
<P>
 Some watching agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of regrouping, Grossman dropped her serve when Frazier's forehand hit 
the tape and dropped in. Even though Grossman broke back to close to 3-2, she 
lost her serve again as Frazier calmly took control. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you play Amy, your mind has to be right in there," Grossman said. "I 
played so many tough matches this week. I was a little bit fried."  
</P>
<P>
 Still, Frazier said she was not overly confident against an opponent she had 
never defeated as a pro. She had watched Grossman fight back so many times, she 
knew the slightest letdown could spell disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 So, she continued banging away, spraying shots cross court with a powerful 
two-handed backhand. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Frazier needs to develop a more well-rounded game. After taking six 
months off last season because of health problems, Frazier returned fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 "She returned with renewed interest and desire," Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 And now Cook wants to add an attacking style to complement the authoritative 
groundstrokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier, who will be No. 21 in today's rankings, has been reluctant to come to 
the net, which fits her passive personality. But deep down, she is a fighter, 
Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 But even after ousting third-ranked Conchita Martinez in the quarterfinals, 
Frazier expressed little joy, saying she was worried about her next opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 After the final, Frazier said she will savor the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman also was enjoying the moment, which does not come often for the 
world's 46th-ranked player. If she had to lose, better to fall to a friend also 
struggling to carve a niche on the women's tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I wasn't going to be like Jennifer Capriati and break into the top 10 
and be the best player," Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will come." Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Halard and Nathalie Tauziat of France won the doubles title, defeating 
Jana Novotna of the Czech Republic and Lisa Raymond, 6-1, 0-6, 6-1.

IT STAYS UGLY TO THE END; BASKETBALL: UNITED STATES TROUNCES RUSSIA, 137-91, TO 
WIN WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP.

 They were no Dream Team and this was no dream but on the last day of the 1994 
World Championships, the world finally got to see what American basketball 
could be. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. players made 16 of their first 17 shots Sunday, led by 49 points and 
went on to defeat Russia, 137-91, before 32,616 in the SkyDome to capture the 
gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if they couldn't match the 44 points a game by which the Dream Team 
drubbed blissed-out foes in the NBA's international debut at the Barcelona 
Olympics in 1992, the Americans won by a tidy average of 25. If you're 
wondering when this competition will get competitive, Don Nelson's suggestion 
is don't hold your breath. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as our best players continue to come and play," said the U.S. coach, 
"it'll be a long time. And maybe never." 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA's participation remains a bonanza for promoters -- FIBA set 
single-game and tournament attendance records in Toronto -- and for 
international coaches, confident that playing the best is the surest path to 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
 It poses a hardship only for the 12 American players. It's a marketing godsend 
for the NBA but it's still like driving a bulldozer over an ant hill or asking 
Heifetz to play at a kids' violin recital. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Dream Team, with its Monte Carlo "training camp" and adoring crowds, 
made it look like fun, this tournament was a reality check. This was days of 
tedium, moments of boorishness. American players were bored out of their skulls 
and finally, after Saturday night's cure-for-insomnia game against Greece, 
admitted it. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Johnson said they were "going through the motions." Joe Dumars, the most 
gentlemanly of the Americans by a Louisiana mile, called it "a very long 
ordeal." The real American triumph might lie in the fact that, on a squad with 
several of the loosest cannons in the NBA, no one went off. 
</P>
<P>
 If the U.S. players thought they had a tough tournament, it was nothing 
compared to some others, such as: 
</P>
<P>
 Canada -- The host team, bent on medaling, limped in seventh. Said embattled 
Coach Ken Shields, obviously with mixed feelings: "Seventh place out of 200 
teams is nothing not to be proud of." Canadian players complained about the 
publicity the Americans were getting, lack of fan support, tenor of the media 
coverage and their coach. Center Mike Smrek met two Toronto reporters to set 
the record straight, asking a distinction be made "between Ken Shields, the 
human being, and Ken Shields, the coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Croatia -- Coach Giuseppe Gierga zinged stars Toni Kukoc and Dino Radja for 
being out of shape. Radja said no one in the tournament could stop him but went 
four for 16 in the semifinal loss to Russia. Kukoc, who recently signed a 
six-year, $26-million contract with the Chicago Bulls, was a virtual no-show 
against Russia, taking only eight shots, scoring five points. 
</P>
<P>
 Greece -- An easy draw and a 4-1 record vaulted the Greeks into the 
semifinals. Coach Makos Dendrinos accepted wipeouts by Croatia and the United 
States, resting his players for Sunday's bronze medal game, in which they were 
drilled anyway, 78-60, by Croatia. Said a Greek reporter to Dendrinos in the 
news conference: "Our pride has turned to bitterness." 
</P>
<P>
 Cuba -- It finished 15th and two players defected. 
</P>
<P>
 Needing a big finish, the United States got a setup in the Russians, who had 
played the United States and Croatia in consecutive games. However, it's hard 
for five players to make 16 of 17 shots even with no one guarding them, but 
that's what the Americans did. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Reggie Miller said they had won the gold "for the little kids in 
their driveways." 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Kemp made the traditional poor-us speech: "It was a little 
disappointing. After all, we were playing for our country, trying to win a gold 
medal. . . . Being compared to that first team so much, it got real old after 
awhile. I thought we were coming here to do the same thing they did, which was 
win. But to be compared like that sometimes takes the joy out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the U.S. players set themselves up, claiming extravagantly and 
often that they could beat the Dream Team. They got the gold, they're going 
home and, at last, there's no taking the joy out of it.

PRICE SWEEPS FIELD ASIDE, WINS BY SIX; GOLF: HE SHOOTS A FINAL-ROUND 67 AND 
BECOMES FIRST TO WIN BRITISH OPEN AND PGA CONSECUTIVELY SINCE HAGEN IN 1924.

 There was no catching Nick Price on the final day of the PGA Championship, as 
golf's newest superstar put the finishing touches on a four-day shooting spree 
that left most everyone gasping for superlatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was fantastic," Corey Pavin said. "He made it very difficult to even have 
hope." 
</P>
<P>
 With his peers in full pursuit, Price played what he called the best first 
nine holes in his life on his way to a 67 and near-record six-shot victory 
Sunday at Southern Hills in the year's fourth and final major tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything fell into place," the 37-year-old from Zimbabwe said. 
</P>
<P>
 This certainly is not in dispute. It was Price's third major title and second 
in succession. Not since Tom Watson won the U.S. and British Opens in 1982 has 
a golfer won consecutive major championships. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Price is the first to win the British Open and PGA back-to-back 
since Walter Hagen in 1924. 
</P>
<P>
 After it was over and Price had accepted a check for $310,000, they started 
checking what Price had left in his wake. 
</P>
<P>
 His 269 total represented a six-shot margin over runner-up Pavin. It is the 
second biggest in PGA Championship history, one stroke less than the mark set 
in 1980 by Jack Nicklaus at Oak Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Price also became the first wire-to-wire PGA champion since Hal Sutton in 1983 
at Riviera and officially overtook Greg Norman in the rankings as the No. 1 
golfer in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Since winning his first major championship at the 1992 PGA, Price has won 16 
titles worldwide, earned $5.56 million and had 37 top-10 finishes in 59 events. 
</P>
<P>
 It's as close to domination as will be found in golf these days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since I won the PGA in 1992, I owe this championship an awful lot because it 
kick-started the second part of my career," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the way I won the British Open this year, it proved something to myself 
and just I have so much confidence in my ability right now and I think it 
showed in the way I played today." 
</P>
<P>
 Price began the day with a three-stroke lead and no one got even one shot 
closer. In fact, in the group of the 11 players closest to Price after 54 
holes, Pavin was the ony one to break par, and he shot a 69. 
</P>
<P>
 Price has put some distance between himself and everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're groping to catch him right now," Ben Crenshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 "God, he's magnificent to watch," he said. "He's a man in full flight. He's 
strong, he's so strong. He has his strength to play big courses day in and day 
out and he's done it forever. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's confident in the way he's playing. I'd say striking the ball, he's been 
as good as anyone since, I'd say, since Ben Hogan and Byron Nelson." 
</P>
<P>
 There wasn't much anyone could do about Price on the last day, although Norman 
and Phil Mickelson gave it a try. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman, the player Price feared most Sunday, began with two birdies, but he 
eventually fell way back with a double bogey on No. 17, where he drove in the 
rough and hit a tree when he tried to chip out. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman settled for a 70 and a four-day total of 277 in a tie for fourth with 
John Cook and Nick Faldo, who had a 66. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickelson came the closest to Price of anyone all day. His second birdie in 
the first four holes put him within three shots of Price, but a double bogey 6 
at No. 16 cost him a chance for second place, which is all Pavin wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, it was already very clear what everybody except Price was playing 
for. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fairly early, it was everybody playing for second place out there," said 
Pavin, who had his best finish in a major. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so far ahead," Pavin said. "It kind of reminded me almost in a way of 
the Nicklaus-Watson battle at the British Open (at Turnberry in 1977) except 
there was nobody battling Nick out there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I won the B flight," he said. "It was Nick and then everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
 Pain managed only one birdie. At the time, Price had an eight-shot lead over 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 If there was any glimmer of hope for anybody else, Price ended it quickly. He 
birdied the 405-yard No. 3 when he hit a wedge shot to within two feet and came 
back with another birdie on No. 4 when his wedge shot landed six feet from the 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as Price rolled in a 22-foot putt on the par-three No. 8, he basically 
was out of sight. The first two birdies made all the difference, Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That just alleviated all the pressure and the nerves and whatever I may have 
had," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is exactly the way he envisioned it, although leading all the way caused 
great expectations for Price, who felt uncomfortable from their weight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so tense," he said. "I knew I was playing well coming into this week 
and (Saturday) was such a difficult day. I think I won the championship 
(Saturday), to be honest with you. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't play with any confidence or direction and it made me so determined. 
Had I not won this week, there would have been a big question mark beside my 
character, I suppose." 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't have to worry about that any more. As he holds up the PGA 
Championship trophy, Price might be able to hear what the other golfers are 
saying about him. Right now, it's Price and everybody else.

STRIKINGLY DISAPPOINTED; THEIR DREAM SEASON BECOMES A NIGHTMARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Imagine watching Leonardo da Vinci painting the Mona Lisa and running out of 
colors. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine listening to Pavarotti singing "Ave Maria" and his microphone going 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine perhaps the greatest offensive season in baseball history being 
reduced to a lousy asterisk by a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Major league baseball is shut down, and no one knows when it will resume. We 
might never know whether Matt Williams, Ken Griffey Jr., Frank Thomas, Barry 
Bonds or Albert Belle could have surpassed Roger Maris as baseball's 
single-season home run leader. 
</P>
<P>
 We might never know whether Tony Gwynn could have become baseball's first .400 
hitter since Ted Williams in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
 We might never know whether Thomas could have become the first player since 
Carl Yastrzemski in 1967 to win the triple crown, or even the first since 
George Brett in 1980 to lead the league in batting average, on-base percentage 
and slugging percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the strike wipes out the rest of the season, we won't know if there 
would have been euphoria in Cleveland, which has endured a 40-year drought 
since the Indians last were in postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
 "This city is emotionally wrecked right now," said Bob DiBiasio, the Indians 
vice president. "For the first time in 40 years, we've got this town turned on 
to baseball again, and now this. 
</P>
<P>
 "For those of us who are not strong willed, you can't help but believe that 
somebody is out to get us." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Griffey, who hit his 40th home run Wednesday night: "We picked a bad year 
to have a good year." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite accusations that the ball was juiced this season, the assault on the 
game's most illustrious records had captivated fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the records figure to remain standing, with no guarantee that they will 
be challenged again any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like, damn, you wish this strike wasn't coming right now," said Bonds, 
who with 37 homers and 29 stolen bases was hoping to join the elite 40-40 club 
and win a third consecutive most valuable player award. 
</P>
<P>
 "They keep saying there are things only Babe Ruth could do, and now you're 
seeing six, seven players who have a chance to do the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Thomas, who was batting .353 with 38 homers and 101 runs batted in: "What 
if the numbers went down next year and nobody challenged those record again? 
That's what hurts. That's what really hurts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a few of us having career years, but we're not getting a chance to 
finish it." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the folks in San Diego, who have painfully endured the dismantling 
of their team the last few years, now might be robbed of witnessing one of 
baseball's greatest feats. 
</P>
<P>
 Gwynn, batting .394, was trying to achieve a piece of baseball immortality by 
hitting .400. It has been nearly 60 years since anyone in the National League 
has hit higher than .380, the last being Arky Vaughan. Vaughan batted .385 for 
the 1935 Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fans are frustrated because records are made to be broken," Gwynn said. "They 
want to see some of these records fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, never in my wildest dreams did I think I'd get this close to .400. 
But as far as I'm concerned, getting an agreement (to end the strike) is more 
important than hitting .400." 
</P>
<P>
 Gwynn can bat .400 if the season resumes. He needs only 27 more plate 
appearances to reach the necessary minimum, and by playing in fewer games, he 
could actually increase his chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston Astro first baseman Jeff Bagwell, who was on a pace to produce the 
most RBIs since Hack Wilson's record of 190 in 1930, didn't even need a strike 
to ruin his season. He suffered a broken hand Tuesday night when he was hit by 
a pitch, perhaps ending his season with a .367 batting average and club records 
of 39 homers and 116 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 There also were the obscure records that could fall: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Minnesota Twin second baseman Chuck Knoblauch has 45 doubles and was on 
pace to catch Earl Webb of the Boston Red Sox, who had a record 67 doubles in 
1931. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gotten to know a lot about ol' Earl," Knoblauch said. "These records 
have been around for so long, so obviously they're almost impossible to break, 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 -- New York Met pitcher Bret Saberhagen has a chance of becoming the first 
pitcher since 1919 to have more victories than walks allowed. Saberhagen is 
14-4 and has walked only 13 this season, and could achieve the feat last 
accomplished by Harry Sallee, who walked only 20 as he posted a 21-7 record for 
the 1919 Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
 And Saberhagen's strikeout-to-walks ratio is 11 to 1, far ahead of Ferguson 
Jenkins' record of 7.1 to 1 in 1971 for the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Colorado Rockies have sold 3,281,511 tickets this season, and were on 
pace to eclipse their record of 4.5 million. Because this is their last season 
at Mile High Stadium -- they will move to Coors Field, which will have a 
50,200-seat capacity -- it might have been a record that would have lasted 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
 The record that never is supposed to be broken is New York Yankee first 
baseman Lou Gehrig's 2,130 consecutive-games playing streak. Baltimore 
shortstop Cal Ripken needs only 122 more games to break it, but the strike has 
presented quite a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The American League tentatively set the 1995 schedule so that Ripken would be 
playing at home against the Yankees when the record is set. Now, with games 
being canceled because of the strike, the American League said Friday it can't 
ensure that the Orioles will be at home for Ripken's feat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping we get lucky and the Orioles are at home, anyway," Derek Irwin 
of the American League office said. "But if not, I don't really know what we 
can do." 
</P>
<P>
 The strike might also ruin the final year of the distinguished careers of 
Andre Dawson, Dave Stewart and Kent Hrbek, all of whom have announced their 
retirements. Fans might also have seen the last double play turned by Alan 
Trammell and Lou Whitaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't play anymore, I'm not looking to end my career on a 
strike-shortened season," Stewart, 37, said. "It's not the way I envisioned 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 And then, there are the sagas of Yankee first baseman Don Mattingly and White 
Sox designated hitter Julio Franco, neither of whom has been to the playoffs in 
his 12-year career, and now is playing for a first-place team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still dream about playing in a World Series," Mattingly said. "And if I 
never got a chance at that because of the strike -- well, I don't want to even 
think about it." 
</P>
<P>
 If it's any solace, Jack Lang, executive secretary of the Baseball Writers 
Assn. of America, said postseason awards still will be presented, even if the 
season is not resumed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballots will be mailed out in mid-September, with instructions that they not 
be returned until after Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "We figured these are our awards," Lang said. "There's no need to sacrifice 
them, too. Besides, there's a lot of money wrapped up in these awards. No 
matter if they play again or not, there's a lot of bonus money you're talking 
about. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Bagwell wins the MVP, he gets $100,000, and the Astros assured me that it 
would be paid."

BEACH VOLLEYBALL; DODD, WHITMARSH WIN AT SEAL BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN ARRITT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Dodd's soft, arching shot seemed to hang in midair, waiting for Kent 
Steffes to slide under and elevate the ball back into play in order to keep his 
team's championship hopes alive. 
</P>
<P>
 With every step toward the ball, however, Steffes seemed to go nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the ball came to rest in the sand, giving Dodd and partner Mike 
Whitmarsh a come-from-behind 15-14 overtime victory Sunday in the final of the 
Miller Lite Open in Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best open I've ever played in," Dodd said after retaining his 
title. "It doesn't get any more exciting than that." 
</P>
<P>
 In 14 years playing professionally, Dodd has won 63 titles, five at Seal 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 What made this match so memorable was how he and Whitmarsh overcame deficits 
of 11-6 and 14-12 to stage a comeback that came down to the final seconds on 
the rally clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Steffes and partner Karch Kiraly reached game point after Dodd and Whitmarsh 
seemed to expend the last of their energy racing down a pair of wayward shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodd dived toward the stands to run down a loose ball, lifting it back over 
his head toward Whitmarsh, who maneuvered around the referee stand and a ball 
boy in a futile effort to keep the rally alive. 
</P>
<P>
 After a timeout during which Whitmarsh never left his landing site under the 
referee stand, he gathered himself and stuffed an errant pass from Steffes to 
pull his team to within 14-13. 
</P>
<P>
 After consecutive sideouts, only 4.5 seconds remained on the clock, meaning 
that Dodd and Whitmarsh had to score on their next serve or time would 
undoubtedly expire. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodd lifted his serve to Kiraly, who got the set back and pounded it off 
Whitmarsh's block, only to see Dodd get it back to Whitmarsh for an off-balance 
spike over the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiraly ran the ball down and again was set up to end the match, but his spike 
went directly at Dodd, who made the dig, got a set from Whitmarsh and put the 
ball right down center for the tying point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nine out of 10 times, Karch hits that ball right off my nose," Dodd said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the crowd on its feet, Dodd returned to the service line and once again 
made Kiraly receive. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiraly tried again to get his spike through the arms of the 6-foot-7 
Whitmarsh, but Whitmarsh got enough of the ball to enable his partner to make 
the dig. Whitmarsh then gave Dodd the set, and the 36-year-old dinked the ball 
in front of Steffes for the winning point. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Kent got stuck in the sand a little bit," Dodd said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the women's final, Cammy Ciarelli and Holly McPeak came out of the losers' 
bracket to retain their title with two consecutive victories over Brazilians 
Sandra Pires and Jackie Silva. 
</P>
<P>
 Ciarelli and McPeak took a 10-0 lead and won the first match, 15-3. 
</P>
<P>
 They won the second, 7-3, after overcoming a 3-0 deficit.

MORNING BRIEFING: BASEBALL TEAM TAKES A NEW TYPE OF WALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So much for the minor leagues being a bastion of baseball purity. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14 members of the Mason City Bats of Iowa quit Friday because of poor 
conditions such as the team bus being too small and bad motel accommodations. 
Players and team officials were also concerned about growing debts, insurance, 
and communication with the league office in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw some problems developing that I thought we needed some answers to, 
because we live here," said John Skipper, now the former general manager. "We 
know these people, and I didn't want to see it get any worse. We just felt like 
we had to do something. I just never thought it would get to this point, but it 
did." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bats were members of the Great Central League. The four-team league is 
professional, but its teams are not aligned with major league franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: In the 1984 NBA draft, the Chicago Bulls selected two athletes 
now considered among the most successful in sports history. One was Michael 
Jordan. Who was the other? 
</P>
<P>
 Tarnished Silver: How bad are things for the Colorado Silver Bullets, an 
all-woman professional baseball team? 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the Billings Mustangs defeated the Silver Bullets, 14-1, despite 
having their manager, Donnie Scott, pitch the first three innings, and using 
assistant general manager Gary Roller and trainer Billy Maxwell in relief. 
</P>
<P>
 The Silver Bullets, who started play this year and are 5-36, managed four hits 
against the Mustangs, who play in the rookie Pioneer League. 
</P>
<P>
 Snap judgment: That's Rodney Peete, Erik Kramer and Andre Ware taking the 
knives out of their backs as Detroit Lion players quickly throw their support 
behind Scott Mitchell as the starting quarterback. After two exhibition games, 
he is already the new Lion king, the $11 million free-agent signee making an 
impact in areas you can't put a price tag on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to get too excited," veteran tackle Lomas Brown told the Detroit 
News, "but the way Scott handled himself -- whew. It was like a circus act here 
the last few years, and now it's stable." 
</P>
<P>
 Said receiver Herman Moore: "When some linebacker is about to knock his head 
off, he steps up in the pocket and keeps looking for somebody. In the past, 
when quarterbacks felt the heat, they abandoned the play. Scott isn't afraid. 
He doesn't panic." 
</P>
<P>
 Bark, but no bite: From Tim Povtak of the Orlando Sentinel: "Is anyone really 
surprised that the eight-week rehabilitation prescribed, instead of surgery, 
for the bad back of Charles Barkley ended after four days? Barkley, who would 
make a great comic-book character, decided he wanted to play golf instead, 
which is typical of his off-season workouts of the past. It's one reason why 
his career may end prematurely. He talks a great game, but the commitment just 
isn't there anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Carl Lewis. The Bulls took him in the 10th round. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Bill Madden of the New York Daily News: "If there were a 
commissioner to impose punishment -- which, of course, there isn't -- the 
baseball owners should be suspended indefinitely for conduct detrimental to the 
game. What they are doing in forcing a shutdown of the game is far worse than 
anything Pete Rose ever did to it." SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the fourth day of the strike, the Angels remain closer to first place than 
the Atlanta Braves. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 What bugs me is the lack of urgency shown by both parties in the labor 
dispute. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Ravitch and Donald Fehr have appeared together more often on 
television than at the negotiating table. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, most of the owners and players are more concerned about punishing 
the other side than about reaching an agreement. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Will the broken hand suffered by Jeff Bagwell during the Houston Astros' 
next-to-last game before the strike be known as a timely injury?. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Gilbert called to say that New York Met pitcher Bret Saberhagen, not 
Dodger third baseman Tim Wallach, should be the National League comeback player 
of the year. By the way, Gilbert is Saberhagen's agent. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you like slaughters, you must have loved switching between the PGA 
Championship and the World Championship basketball final Sunday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Shaquille O'Neal was one Dream Team II member who would have belonged on Dream 
Team I. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The competition in Canada was weak, but O'Neal showed that he has improved his 
footwork and will be a more versatile offensive player next season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 TV analyst Doug Collins wondered if there will be a better starting five in 
the NBA this season than O'Neal, Horace Grant, Dennis Scott, Anfernee Hardaway 
and Nick Anderson of the Orlando Magic. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The trash-talking Americans might not have won any Mr. Congeniality awards, 
but, as usual, Joe Dumars was a class act.The veteran Detroit Piston guard 
never embarrassed the opposition and asked Coach Don Nelson to cut his playing 
time so teammates could play more. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Riddick Bowe needs an eye exam if he didn't realize that Buster Mathis Jr. was 
on one knee when he landed a right hand on Mathis' jaw Saturday night. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad George Foreman wasn't working the fight for HBO because he could have 
told viewers about the time he did virtually the same thing to Joe (King) Roman 
in the first round in Tokyo in 1973. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 That night, though, Foreman, making his first defense of the heavyweight 
title, was declared a knockout winner over Roman. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The "no contest" ruling in Atlantic City was proper, but there is no need for 
a rematch. Mathis, though willing, is not exactly the complete package. It was 
only a matter of moments before Bowe would have finished him cleanly. . . . 
Bowe got sharper as the bout progressed, but looked like a fighter coming off a 
nine-month layoff. He should have a tuneup fight or two before challenging 
Lennox Lewis for the World Boxing Council title. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Funny, but Foreman would be a heavy favorite over Joe Hipp, who is expected to 
replace him as Michael Moorer's next opponent. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 And if you don't think politics were involved in the cancellation of the 
Moorer- Foreman fight, how come the WBA waited until a month after the bout was 
signed to announce that it wouldn't sanction Foreman? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Former bantamweight and super-bantamweight champion Lupe Pintor, 39, should be 
saying "no mas" after being stopped by Leonardo Mas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Delahoussaye again demonstrated that nobody is better on a stretch 
runner when he rode Tinners Way to victory over Best Pal in the $1-million 
Pacific Classic Saturday at Del Mar. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 USC quarterback Rob Johnson and tackle Tony Boselli were among Trojans who 
worked on the Coliseum reconstruction crew this summer. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I only worked about a week and a half, sweeping up and picking up trash and 
wood," Johnson said. "Some of it was on the graveyard shift from 8 p.m. to 5 
a.m. I lost interest fast. I usually get bored when I'm doing something besides 
sports." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The stadium, which was badly damaged by the earthquake, is supposed to be 
ready in time for the Trojans' Sept. 3 opener against Washington and Johnson is 
delighted about that. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the Coliseum," he said. "It gives us a huge home-field advantage. I 
think a lot of visiting teams are intimidated." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders showed midseason form Saturday in Pittsburgh when they were 
penalized 10 times. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 So did the Rams when they put their quarterbacks' lives in danger against the 
New England Patriots. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of 1,000-yard running back Leonard Russell won't help the Denver 
Broncos solve their biggest problem, which is defense. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Parity among Americans on the PGA Tour means mediocrity when none of them wins 
a Grand Slam tournament in 1994.

SOCCER / GRAHAME L. JONES; WORLD CUP STARS SCATTERED ACROSS EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that the baseball players have taken a walk, what are the players who run 
for a living doing? 
</P>
<P>
 Players such as Gheorghe Hagi and Juergen Klinsmann. Players such as Claudio 
Caniggia and Marcio Santos. Players such as Romario and -- lest we forget -- 
Hristo Stoitchkov. 
</P>
<P>
 A month has passed since Italy's Roberto Baggio blasted the final kick of the 
1994 World Cup high over the crossbar, sealing Brazil's victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The new season has begun in Europe, with league play already under way in 
France and England and soon to begin in Germany, Spain and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are the five major soccer-playing powers in Europe, based upon the 
strength of their professional leagues. It is where the majority of the 
big-name clubs are located and where most of the star players earn their 
living. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, it is where to find those who enthralled U.S. fans in the summer of 
'94. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 England's failure to qualify for the World Cup appears to have had one 
unexpected benefit -- a new willingness to accept that foreign players might be 
better and therefore are worth signing. 
</P>
<P>
 The London club Tottenham Hotspur, better known simply as Spurs, led the way 
by signing two of the World Cup's best strikers -- Klinsmann of Germany for $3 
million from AS Monaco of France and Ilie Dumitrescu of Romania for $4 million 
from Steaua Bucharest. 
</P>
<P>
 That puts Spurs, which is coached by 1978 World Cup winner Ossie Ardiles of 
Argentina, in a much better position to challenge defending champion Manchester 
United, which is packed with foreign talent, including France's Eric Cantona 
and Wales' Ryan Giggs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Dumitrescu chose England, two of his Romanian World Cup teammates sought 
out the sunshine in Spain. Hagi has joined Barcelona, while Florin Raducioiu 
left AC Milan in Italy to sign for Barcelona's cross-town rival, Espanol. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagi's move, which reportedly has earned him a $1-million annual salary, 
leaves Barcelona Coach Johan Cruyff with an interesting problem. He has four of 
the world's top players under contract but can play only three foreigners in a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Whom does he leave out? Romario, the Brazilian goal-scoring ace? Unthinkable. 
Stoitchkov, the Bulgarian who is equally adept at finding the net? Not likely. 
Hagi, the Romanian midfielder who sets up the plays? Not a chance. Ronald 
Koeman, the Dutch defender with the lethal free kick? How could he? 
</P>
<P>
 Cruyff has coached Barcelona to four consecutive Spanish league titles by 
being able to make such decisions, but this season could prove to be his most 
challenging. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 European champion AC Milan had much the same problem over the past year or two 
because team owner Silvio Berlusconi, now Italy's prime minister, insisted on 
buying the best players available even though it meant some would have to sit.  
</P>
<P>
 Like their Spanish counterparts, Italian clubs can sign as many foreign stars 
as they want but are allowed to play only three. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, AC Milan has cut its foreign contingent by sending French striker 
Jean-Pierre Papin to Bayern Munich of Germany; by selling Danish 
midfielder/forward Brian Laudrup to the Glasgow Rangers in Scotland, and 
shipping Raducioiu to Espanol. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, Coach Fabio Capello has brought Dutch star Ruud Gullit back to 
Milan from Sampdoria. 
</P>
<P>
 Milan still has an exceptional team, but it will be quite a task to retain 
both its Italian and European championships and win the world club championship 
in December. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 South American players make a huge impact in Europe and give the game there an 
unrivaled edge over the rest of the world. Every World Cup sees a new influx of 
talent crossing the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 The most startling acquisition made after World Cup '94 was by the Dutch team, 
PSV Eindhoven, which bought 17-year-old Ronaldo from Cruzeiro of Brazil for $6 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronaldo was on the Brazilian World Cup-winning team but did not play in any of 
its matches. He has been earmarked for success for some time, and PSV had to 
fight off strong challenges from reigning Dutch champion Ajax Amsterdam and 
from AC Milan to acquire him. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for Ronaldo to be sold to an Italian or Spanish club in a few years for 
considerably more than $6 million. The Dutch club is known for its wise 
investments; one of its former stars is Romario. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the size of the Ronaldo deal, it pales in comparison to what Genoa of 
Italy spent to acquire Kazuyoshi Miura of Japan from Yomiuri. 
</P>
<P>
 Genoa loaned Miura, the J-League's most popular and famous player, for one 
year for a reported $7.5 million. He will become the first Asian player to 
compete in the Italian first division. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among South American World Cup performers on the move in Europe are Caniggia, 
of Argentina, who was traded to Benfica of Portugal by AS Roma of Italy for a 
sum reportedly between $3.8 million and $4.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Caniggia was banned for 13 months after testing positive for cocaine in 1993 
and has not played for Roma since, although he did play for Argentina in its 
World Cup campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, two of Brazil's World Cup defenders have switched clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazinho has been loaned by Palmeiras of Brazil to Valencia of Spain at the 
special request of Brazilian World Cup Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira, who left 
that position to become Valencia's coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Parreira has been busy in the transfer market and among other players he has 
acquired are Russia's Oleg Salenko, who scored a World Cup-record five goals 
against Cameroon, and Spanish World Cup goalkeeper Adoni Zubizarreta, from 
Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
 The other Brazilian defender to move is Marcio Santos, who was purchased by 
Fiorentina of Italy for $3.2 million from Bordeaux in France. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Palmeiras also has sold Colombian World Cup midfielder Freddy 
Rincon to Napoli in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most curious move made in the off-season was that of Irish striker 
Tony Cascarino, who left Chelsea in England to sign with Olympique Marseille in 
France. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Marseille has been demoted to the French second division in the wake 
of a bribery scandal, most of its stars have abandoned ship. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, two French players, Jocelyn Angloma and Basile Boli, left to join 
Torino in Italy and the Glasgow Rangers in Scotland, respectively. Similarly, 
Yugoslavia's Dragan Stojkovic left to sign for Grampus Eight in Japan; 
Brazilian Sonny Anderson moved to AS Monaco and Portugal's Rui Baros went home 
to FC Porto. 
</P>
<P>
 Cascarino will play alongside Germany's Rudi Voeller as Marseille attempts to 
win promotion back to the first division. Soccer Notes 
</P>
<P>
 A first-half penalty kick by French star Eric Cantona and a bicycle-kick goal 
nine minutes before the final whistle by Paul Ince of England gave Manchester 
United a 2-0 victory over the Blackburn Rovers on Sunday at Wembley Stadium in 
London in the Charity Shield match, the traditional opener to the English 
season. . . . Hungary has hired former national team defender Kalman Meszoly as 
its national coach. Meszoly has held the post twice before, including during 
the 1982 World Cup in Spain. . . . Stefan Effenberg, the German player who was 
sent home from the World Cup after making an obscene gesture at fans in Dallas, 
has been traded from Fiorentina in Italy to Germany's Borussia 
Moenchengladbach, his former club. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico will have to wait until January or February of 1996 to defend its title 
in the CONCACAF Gold Cup. The Mexicans won the second edition of the tournament 
in 1993, defeating the United States, 4-0, in the final at Azteca Stadium in 
Mexico City. But Chuck Blazer, general secretary of CONCACAF, said next 
summer's international schedule is too crowded to allow the competition to be 
played. On tap next summer are the Copa America, or South American 
Championship, in Uruguay, as well as the U.S. Cup '95 tournament and the 
Under-20 and Under-17 world championships. 
</P>
<P>
 The German Supercup was won by Werder Bremen, which defeated Bayern Munich, 
3-1, in overtime in a match pitting the German Cup winner against the league 
champion. The result meant a losing debut for new Bayern Munich Coach Giovanni 
Trapattoni. . . . Italian World Cup goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca has been 
traded from Sampdoria to Inter Milan. . . . In Montreal today, Trinidad & 
Tobago plays Jamaica and Canada plays Mexico in the CONCACAF qualifying 
tournament for next summer's FIFA Women's World Championship in Sweden. . . . 
The reelection Saturday of Alan Rothenberg as United States Soccer Federation 
president also saw the election of Larry Monaco as executive vice president and 
Bill Goaziou as treasurer, succeeding Hank des Bordes and Richard Groff, 
respectively.

GOLF ROUNDUP; JACKLIN SHOOTS A 68 TO WIN SENIOR EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tony Jacklin, five weeks removed from his 50th birthday and playing on a 
sponsor's exemption, shot a four-under 68 on Sunday and won the Senior PGA 
Tour's rain-shortened First of America Classic at Grand Rapids, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 The event was shortened to 36 holes when rain washed out Saturday's round. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacklin, the 1969 British Open champion and 1970 U.S. Open winner, beat Dave 
Stockton by one stroke in only his fourth start on the Senior Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his first victory in the United States since the 1972 Greater 
Jacksonville Open and his first professional victory since the 1982 Sun 
Alliance PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacklin, two strokes off the lead when play began, finished with an 
eight-under 136. His second 68 included an eagle on the 513-yard, par-five 13th 
hole at Egypt Valley Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is great," said Jacklin, who earned $97,500. "I am just so happy. I can 
tell you I didn't expect to win this early." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Trevino and Jim Albus finished two strokes behind. Trevino shot a 66 on 
Sunday. Albus, who shared the first-round lead at 66 and was seeking his second 
consecutive victory, had a 72. 
</P>
<P>
 British Seniors champion Tom Wargo and Harry Toscano tied for fifth at 139, 
with John Paul Cain and Jimmy Powell another shot back. 
</P>
<P>
 Trevino, who has won six times this year, earned $42,900 and passed Bob 
Charles as the tour's all-time money leader with $5,076,469.

 Maggie Will survived the first playoff hole despite a bogey, then birdied the 
second to beat Jill Briles-Hinton and Alicia Dibos in the inaugural Children's 
Medical Center LPGA Classic at Beavercreek, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Will, 29, of Whiteville, N.C., rolled in a 15-foot birdie putt to close out 
the playoff and collect $52,500 from a purse of $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third victory in her six-year career and her first top-10 finish 
since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Her third consecutive round of two-under 70 got her to six-under 210 and into 
the playoff. She made a 24-foot, side-hill birdie putt on the 18th hole to jump 
into a share of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Briles-Hinton had a two-stroke lead heading to 18, but she bogeyed the hole 
while Will and Dibos, the 36-hole leader by one stroke, each birdied to force 
extra holes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always have the feeling that somebody else will knock it in," said 
Briles-Hinton, a non-winner in eight years and 213 tournaments as a pro. "That 
way you won't be so disappointed when they do." 
</P>
<P>
 Beth Daniel, the tour's No. 2 money winner, missed a 10-foot birdie putt on 18 
that would have put her in the playoff. She had a final-round 71.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; KNOX CRITICIZES OFFENSIVE LINE 
</P>

<P>
 After reviewing the work of his offensive linemen in Saturday night's 28-10 
loss to the New England Patriots, Ram Coach Chuck Knox panned their 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did not grade out very well," Knox said Sunday."There were penalties and 
individual breakdowns in pass protection. In the first half alone we had 99 
yards in offense called back because of penalties." 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Wayne Gandy, projected to start at left tackle, drew four penalties for 
lining up illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Did someone on the coaching staff happen to mention to Gandy that he was 
making the same mistake over and over again? 
</P>
<P>
 "He was told. They were all told," Knox said. "I don't know whether he was 
getting the message, but obviously he was not doing what he needs to do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams felt pretty good about their off-season efforts to improve their 
roster, but to date there has been no impact on the field. The Rams are 0-2 in 
exhibition games, and with the exception of quarterback Chris Miller and 
running back Johnny Bailey, there hasn't been a lot to get excited about. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to score more than one touchdown in two games," Knox said. "It 
certainly is a wake-up call." 
</P>
<P>

 Defensive coordinator George Dyer said the decision to start linebacker Joe 
Kelly in place of Henry Rolling was made to give Kelly an opportunity to play 
with the first unit. T.J. SIMERS

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; PENALTIES STILL A PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cutting down the number of penalties was a priority for Coach Art Shell in 
Saturday's game at Pittsburgh. So how did the Raiders do in their 29-17 loss to 
the Steelers? Not good, as they were penalized 10 times for 81 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having 10 penalties is still too much," said Shell, whose team came close to 
setting a team record with 113 penalties for 832 yards last season. "We have to 
cut down on our mistakes and our personal fouls." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shell also was displeased with the running game, which struggled to gain only 
50 yards in 16 carries, with tailbacks Tyrone Montgomery and Harvey Williams 
combining for 42 yards in 11 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to do a much better job running the ball," Shell said Sunday at the 
team's Oxnard training camp. "We have to attack better. We had opportunities to 
get things going but our backs missed a couple of reads." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite rumors of a lineup change in the backfield, with Tom Rathman and 
Williams replacing starters Napoleon McCallum and Montgomery before the Raiders 
play the Rams at Anaheim on Saturday, Shell said no changes have been made. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 After spending the first month of training camp at right cornerback, Albert 
Lewis on Saturday played on the left side, the position he played for most of 
his 11 years with the Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had two quality cornerbacks (Terry McDaniel and Lionel Washington) when we 
signed Albert and all we told him is that he'll get a chance to compete," Shell 
said. "We want versatility and that's the reason why we had him playing on the 
right side up until now." LONNIE WHITE

 The Dallas Cowboys play the Houston Oilers at Azteca Stadium in Mexico City 
tonight before what is expected to be the largest crowd ever to see an NFL 
game.

 Some 108,000 tickets have been sold for the game. The attendance record for a 
game involving an NFL team was set at Chicago's Soldier Field in 1947 when the 
College All-Stars played the NFL champion Chicago Bears before 105,840.

 A crippled hog and 20 cents were the only offerings a radio talk show in 
Mexico, Mo., received when it solicited donations for striking ballplayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was almost like a normal telethon," co-host Gary Fox said of the fund 
drive, held during KXEO-AM's weekly program, Sportstalk Saturday. "We promoted 
it all week as a pledge drive for the major league baseball players because we 
know how they're suffering right now." 
</P>
<P>
 An anonymous male caller offered the hog, suitable for a barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
 "He called out of nowhere," Fox said. "He felt sorry for us because we were 
dying. We weren't getting any phone calls." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox chipped in half of the 20-cent contribution because he felt sorry for 
catcher Erik Pappas, who was recalled from the minors by the St. Louis 
Cardinals before the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 The other dime came from Melissa Smith, who said she wanted to keep Kansas 
City Royal pitcher Hipolito Pichardo from going broke. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith will receive a Pichardo baseball card for her donation.

 Kids looking forward to a baseball clinic this weekend in Alexandria, Va., 
featuring Baltimore Oriole players and coaches had to settle for coaches only. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the players showed up for the final Oriole baseball clinic of the 
season Saturday at Edison High in Alexandria. About 300 kids learned about 
baserunning from Davey Lopes, fielding from Don Buford and catching from Elrod 
Hendricks, but they learned nothing about the end of the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've still got a few out here who want to play," said pitching coach Dick 
Bosman, watching a group of youngsters learning to throw. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents at the clinic were not sympathetic to the no-show striking 
ballplayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping there would be more players, what with the strike, I figured 
they would want to keep up community relations," said Jan Epstein of 
Alexandria.

ANTITRUST EXEMPTION OK, MITCHELL SAYS; BASEBALL: SENATOR SAYS NEGOTIATIONS ARE 
ANSWER. UNFORTUNATELY, THERE ARE NONE ON DAY 3 OF STRIKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was no communication Sunday between negotiators for the baseball owners 
and striking players, and there is no meeting scheduled today. Both sides said 
they hoped to hear today from the federal mediators, with whom they met on 
Saturday, but the atmosphere on Day 3 of the work stoppage seemed to match the 
gray and rainy weather of New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The only development of the quiet day came in Washington, where Sen. George 
Mitchell (D-Maine), who will retire after the current Congressional session, 
said he did not believe the Senate should reconsider baseball's antitrust 
exemption. Mitchell's view was not a surprise; he is believed to be the leading 
candidate to become baseball's next commissioner and the owners oppose removing 
the exemption. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked on NBC's "Meet the Press" if the Senate Judiciary Committee, which 
voted, 10-7, in June against a bill that would have removed the exemption from 
the sport's labor dealings, should reconsider, Mitchell said, "No, I don't 
believe so. We're dealing with health care and crime. . . . which will take all 
of our time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe this is a matter to be resolved by the parties in collective 
bargaining. That's what the collective bargaining process is. That's what it 
should be. I'm not involved in it in any way, despite all of the speculation. 
But I think it's fair to say both sides are losing financially as a result of 
the strike, and it ought to be settled between them in their own collective 
bargaining. That's the proper way to do it in our system." 
</P>
<P>
 Don Fehr, executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Assn., has 
said repeatedly during the current negotiations that the owners are allowed to 
act in the manner of an unregulated monopoly because of the exemption. He has 
cited their withholding of a $7.8-million pension payment, the refusal to let 
owners sit at the bargaining table, the absence of a commissioner, the ongoing 
vacancies in the executive offices of the licensing department and a report on 
the restructuring of the commissioner's office "that amounted to nothing" as 
some of the acts of a monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm amazed that the owners have acted so irresponsibly, but that's what a 
cartel does," he said the other day. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr declined interview requests Sunday, accepting the advice of mediators to 
let the rhetoric diminish. Meanwhile, Charlie Finley, former owner of the 
Oakland Athletics and a man seldom at a loss for words, predicted from his 
LaPorte, Ind., home that owners wouldn't let the strike last more than another 
week because they can't afford it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a few clubs that have been sold recently or purchased for $100 
million, $125 million, $150 million," Finley said. "When they pay that much 
money, those guys are leveraged to the hilt, and have to make those payments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I foresee enough owners concerned about making them that they're going to 
have to give in at the end. They've done it so many times before." 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball's eighth work stoppage since 1972 stems from the owners' insistence 
on a salary cap the union says it will never accept and the union's concern the 
owners will declare an impasse and implement a compensation system based on the 
cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problems today go back to when players wanted arbitration," said Finley, 
77. "I talked to every owner in both leagues and told them about the pitfalls 
of arbitration. And I was convinced at that time they'd vote against it for 
those reasons, but when it came time to vote, everybody voted for arbitration 
except Augie Busch of the Cardinals and Charlie Finley. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The owners) brought this on themselves by giving into arbitration to begin 
with. Don't forget, you're talking about a salary cap, and the (players) don't 
want a salary cap because it eliminates arbitration."

NAVRATILOVA'S RETIREMENT TOUR WON'T INCLUDE THE U.S. OPEN

 Four-time winner Martina Navratilova will not play in the U.S. Open, which 
begins Aug. 29 in New York, because she is not ready for the two-week grind of 
Flushing Meadow. 
</P>
<P>
 "My 37-year-old body is telling me to play on indoor surfaces, and I think 
it's time to listen," Navratilova said in a statement released Sunday."I want 
to spend time preparing physically and mentally for the . . . other tournaments 
I will play before I retire." 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova, who will retire in November, failed in her bid to win a 10th 
Wimbledon title last month when she lost in the final to Conchita Martinez. She 
played in the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles last week, losing in the third 
round to Ann Grossman after playing about five hours of singles and doubles the 
night before. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova's next scheduled tournament is an indoor event at Filderstadt, 
Germany, starting Oct. 10. ELLIOTT ALMOND

TENNIS / ATP CHAMPIONSHIP; CHANG DEFEATS EDBERG SECOND YEAR IN A ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Chang won his second consecutive ATP Championship on Sunday, defeating 
Stefan Edberg of Sweden, 6-2, 7-5, in a rematch of last year's final. 
</P>
<P>
 While Edberg was lethargic at first, Chang was relentless, winning the first 
11 points and never letting Edberg back in the match. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's beaten me bad; he shows no mercy," Chang said. "If a guy's off that day, 
you take advantage of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Edberg, also a two-time winner at the $1.72-million ATP Championship, said he 
was mystified by his slow start. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some reason, I found it very tough to get going today," Edberg said. "He 
got the first set very easily, and you can't afford to do that against 
Michael." 
</P>
<P>
 Edberg called the first three games, in which Chang broke his serve twice, "a 
nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was frustrated, almost embarrassed," Edberg said. "But I kept going. Things 
got better. At least in the second set, things got better." 
</P>
<P>
 Each player held serve through the first 10 games of the second set. But Chang 
broke Edberg in game 11 and served out for the match. 
</P>
<P>
 Match point was a line call that Edberg disputed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see the mark on the court," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he did not argue the call. 
</P>
<P>
 "The match was over," he said. "There is not a lot you can do. The guy in the 
chair isn't going to change the call from there." 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a decade, the ATP Championship has been a haven for Edberg. He 
has played the past 11 years and never failed to reach at least the 
quarterfinals. He has reached the semifinals eight times, and Sunday's final 
was his sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang, a five-time winner on the ATP Tour this year, is the tournament's first 
repeat titlist since Mats Wilander captured the crown in 1983-84. 
</P>
<P>
 Edberg has an 11-6 record against Chang, but Chang has won the past three 
meetings dating to last year's ATP Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pretty pumped up because of last year," Chang said. "I thought Stefan 
would be out for revenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Chang didn't relax, even after winning the first set so easily.

MOTOR RACING ROUNDUP; MARTIN CRUISES TO EASY VICTORY AT WATKINS GLEN 
</P>

 Mark Martin and his Ford Thunderbird were a flawless combination Sunday during 
a dominating victory in the Budweiser at the Glen NASCAR stock-car race at 
Watkins Glen, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have any trouble anywhere at all," Martin said after winning from 
the pole for the second consecutive year on the 2.45-mile, 11-turn road course. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Martin's first victory of the season and 13th of his Winston Cup 
career. And it came easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving for Roush Racing, Martin led 75 of the 90 laps and handily fought off 
a late challenge from Ernie Irvan, winning the battle of Thunderbirds by 0.88 
seconds -- about four car-lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never gave up," Irvan said. "I kept thinking maybe he would slip or 
something. The last lap he took it easy and I caught him pretty good, but Mark 
drove a great race. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you can go on a road course and not make any mistakes -- and Mark 
didn't make any today -- our hat's off to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Earnhardt, the six-time and defending series champion, finished third, 
and held onto the same 27-point lead he had coming into the 20th of 31 races 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin was cruising along with a lead hovering near three seconds when the 
fourth full-course caution flag waved on lap 81 enabled Irvan to move up to 
Martin's rear bumper for the restart on lap 85. 
</P>
<P>
 When the green flag waved, Irvan tried an inside move and an outside move as 
the leaders raced into the first turn. The cars nearly touched, but Martin 
pulled away.

 Al Unser led a 1-2-3 Team Penske sweep in the Miller Genuine Draft 200, which 
turned on a stop-and-go penalty against teammate Paul Tracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The third Penske team member, Emerson Fittipaldi, who won this race at 
Lexington, Ohio, the previous two years, was third. Robby Gordon finished 
fourth and Michael Andretti fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy, who had led all but one lap, was penalized by CART officials for 
passing Gordon under a yellow caution flag on lap 53. The penalty forced Tracy 
to make an extra pit stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't planning on passing him, but he locked up his brakes and almost slid 
off the track," Tracy said of Gordon. "What am I supposed to do? He slipped 
wide." 
</P>

 Michael Schumacher of Germany won the Hungarian Grand Prix at Mogyorod and his 
Benetton Ford teammate Jos Verstappen finished third. Schumacher sailed through 
77 laps on the 2.46-mile Hungaroring circuit in 1 hour 48 minutes .185 seconds 
at an average speed of 105.237 m.p.h.

Jasper scooping it up and heading toward the goal line 39 yards away, in the 
open field, on national television on a Thursday night. It was a linebacker's 
dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw it and said, 'Oh, no,' " Jasper said Sunday. "Everybody saw it and 
yelled 'Hawk, hawk.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Or was it "Faulk, Faulk?" San Diego State's Marshall Faulk hauled Jasper down 
from behind on the seven-yard line. Two plays later, UCLA scored in a 52-13 
victory in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody lets Jasper forget. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I went home during the summer, everybody was talking to me about it," he 
said. " 'How did you get caught like that?' I tell them, it took a 4.3 (-second 
40-yard dash) man to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Home is Troup, Tex., in the rural eastern part of the state, and Jasper also 
let everybody know there that it was his turn in 1994. After two seasons of 
being the third inside linebacker in a two-linebacker defensive set, Jasper is 
the lone experienced player at the position returning and will line up 
alongside Rod Smalley, who is moving over from outside linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew before that Nkosi (Littleton) and Carrick (O'Quinn) were the 
experienced players and starters, but now they're gone and I've been working 
harder than ever on my running and in the weight room because I knew it would 
be my time," Jasper said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that he hadn't played. Jasper was in on 60 tackles last season, 
frequently subbing when O'Quinn was injured. Only outside linebacker Donnie 
Edwards returns with more tackles. 
</P>
<P>
 Jasper is similar to Littleton in stature, an inch taller at 6 feet 3 and 
about the same bulk at 250 pounds, and might be a step faster. And his work 
ethic will be challenged. Unlike O'Quinn and Littleton, there is no Shane 
Jasper behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, there are sophomores Jeff Ruckman and Brent Guyton, who are still 
learning the position. 
</P>
<P>

 Injury report: defensive tackle London Woodfin is nursing a knee injury after 
undergoing arthroscopic surgery in May; freshman lineman Terry Williams has a 
shoulder injury; linebacker Travis Shipman has a hamstring pull; wide receiver

knee surgery. . . . Junior linebacker Donnie Edwards is on schedule to graduate 
after the winter quarter. He plans to play as a graduate student next season. .

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; USC; FRESHMAN RUSSELL IMPRESSIVE SO FAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Freshman Darrell Russell continues to impress everyone in USC's early 
workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-4, 290-pound defensive end from St. Augustine High in San Diego has 
shown speed and strength, even working against senior Tony Boselli, an 
All-American offensive tackle.He spun around the 320-pound Boselli in a 
pass-blocking drill Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 During fitness drills before practice, Russell had a 28-inch vertical leap. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russell will be heard from this year -- he's gifted," Coach John Robinson 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson erupted in a running drill Sunday, when guard Chris Brymer didn't 
knock down a tackling dummy with sufficient zeal to please the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Brymer was pulling on a tailback run play, and the dummy was supposed to 
simulate a safety. Brymer sort of leaned on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson: "Brymer! I want you to knock that dummy down! This is your chance, 
Brymer. Don't you realize that defensive backs call guys like you big, fat . . 
. ? This is your chance to get even!" 
</P>
<P>
 Next time, Brymer flattened the dummy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Senior kicker Cole Ford, who sat out seven games last season because of a back 
injury, has been booming 50-yard field goals in practice routinely, making it 
likely that freshman Adam Abrams will be redshirted. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Injuries: Starting offensive guard Kris Pollack sat out Sunday's practices 
wearing a neck brace. He suffered neck spasms during Saturday's practice. EARL

DEL MAR; ANOTHER CLASSIC IS IN THE FUTURE FOR TINNERS WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tinners Way made his way up the freeway and back to his regular surroundings 
at Hollywood Park's barn 52S Sunday, less than 24 hours after justifying the 
200-mile round-trip van ride with a one-length victory in the $1-million 
Pacific Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Bobby Frankel, who won Del Mar's richest race for the third 
consecutive time, doesn't have any specific plans for Tinners Way, but however 
the campaign unfolds, it is expected to lead to an appearance in the $3-million 
Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs on Nov. 5. An Eclipse Award winner 
last year as trainer and the national purse leader with $8.8 million, Frankel 
has started 22 horses without a victory in the Breeders' Cup series. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be looking for a race for him about a month from now," Frankel said. 
"Then I'll be looking for another race about a month before the Breeders' Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 Tinners Way is from the last crop sired by Secretariat, the 1973 Triple Crown 
champion who died in 1989. Lady's Secret, a daughter of Secretariat, won the 
Breeders' Cup Distaff in 1986, but Tinners Way became the first male from the 
sire to win a million-dollar race. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a good grass horse when he ran in Europe," said Frankel, who began 
training Tinners Way late last year. "We started running him on the dirt after 
I got him because we didn't want him going up against some of the good grass 
horses that I had for Juddmonte." 
</P>
<P>
 Frankel is the lead American trainer for Juddmonte Farms, which races 
world-wide for Prince Khalid Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. Another Juddmonte star 
trained by Frankel is Fanmore, who will be one of the favorites in the 
Arlington Million on grass Aug. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankel didn't send any horses to Del Mar this season because he said too many 
broke down there last year. He vans his horses from Hollywood Park to Del Mar 
for their races. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's working out," Frankel said. "Tinners Way has got hot in the paddock 
before some of his races, but Saturday he was the best he's ever been. I'm just 
glad my horses haven't been at Santa Anita with this heat wave. It's probably 
120 degrees over there." 
</P>
<P>
 Tinners Way won three of seven grass races in Europe, but was one for seven on 
dirt before the Pacific Classic. He benefited from fast fractions -- 21 3/5, 44 
2/5 and 1:08 3/5 -- set during a pace duel between Bertrando and Slew Of 
Damascus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Tinners Way would have won even if they'd run the first half-mile in 
46," Frankel said. "One of the important things about this game is watching how 
the other guys train. Bertrando (who was in Frankel's care last year when he 
was voted best older horse) wasn't ready for a mile and a quarter. But I think 
Best Pal was fit. He ran a good race. I don't think you'll see him run a much 
better race than he did Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
 Slew Of Damascus finished fourth, Bertrando was eighth and Best Pal ran 
second. Best Pal, whose career has been marred by sore hoofs, ran twice this 
winter at Santa Anita, then was off for more than five months before winning a 
sprint stake on July 22 at Hollywood Park, his only prep for the Pacific 
Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure that we would have outrun Tinners Way, anyhow," said Best Pal's 
trainer, Richard Mandella, "but I was short of time in getting my horse ready 
for this race. I would have liked to have been able to give him one more race 
before Saturday, but I didn't have that option. Best Pal's a pretty gifted 
horse, and he almost made up for what the trainer wasn't able to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Bertrando and Best Pal weren't the only top horses to lose during the weekend. 
Paradise Creek, undefeated this year, couldn't beat Lure in the Bernard Baruch 
at Saratoga on Friday and the next day Heavenly Prize upset Lakeway in the 
Alabama at the upstate New York track. And two weeks before, Tabasco Cat, 
winner of the Preakness and Belmont Stakes, was beaten by Unaccounted For in 
the Jim Dandy at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankel became the second trainer to saddle the winners of the same 
million-dollar race three years in a row. Wayne Lukas won the Breeders' Cup 
Juvenile with Capote, Success Express and Is It True in 1986-88. Frankel didn't 
have a starter in the first Pacific Classic, which Best Pal won in 1991, but he 
ran 1-2 with Missionary Ridge and Defensive Play in 1992 and was 1-2-4 with 
Bertrando, Missionary Ridge and Marquetry last year. Out of $3 million in 
Pacific Classic purse money in the last three years, the Frankel barn has 
earned $2.125 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arlington Million is next. Frankel has had terrible luck in the race, not 
finishing better than fifth with eight starters. In Fanmore, he has the winner 
of the Arlington Handicap on Aug. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "That race over the course won't hurt," Frankel said. "I think he'll run very 
well there." Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin's Faith prevailed in a four-horse photo finish Sunday in the La Jolla 
Handicap as trainer Ian Jory saddled his first Del Mar stakes winner since Best 
Pal in the 1990 Del Mar Futurity. Less than a length separated Unfinished 
Symph, Ocean Crest and You And I at the wire, with Marvin's Faith, ridden by 
Chris Antley, winning by a nose over Unfinished Symph, the 6-5 favorite. 
Marvin's Faith, scratched out of an allowance race Saturday, carried the low 
weight of 112 pounds in the seven-horse La Jolla. The 3-year-old gelding went 
from running in important stakes last year to a $32,000 claiming race at 
Hollywood Park six weeks ago. He was 16-1 Sunday after running fifth in a 
division of the Oceanside Stakes on opening day. Unfinished Symph went into the 
La Jolla off two stakes victories at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Del Mar stewards have suspended jockey Antonio Castanon for 30 days for 
being "engaged in use of (a) drug." Castanon, winless at Del Mar this season, 
must give proof of attending an ongoing rehabilitation program before he will 
be reinstated. . . . Saturday's overall handle of $14.8 million was a Del Mar 
record.

 Via Borghese led from start in scoring a two-length victory over Blazing Kadie 
in the $138,350 Diana Handicap at Saratoga on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Via Borghese, a 5-year-old daughter of Seattle Dancer-Angela Serra who was 
ridden by Jose Santos, covered 1 1/8 miles on the inner turf course in 1:52. 
</P>
<P>
 Blazing Kadie, who started on the outside in the field of seven, pressed the 
pace and finished second. It was another length back to Coronation Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Via Borghese earned $83,010 for Malcolm E. Parrish and returned $11.80, $6.60 
and $3.80. Blazing Kadie paid $16.60 and $6.00 and Coronation Cup returned 
$5.00.

ITALIAN GLOBETROTTER; A YEAR AFTER SPURNING INDIANA TO PLAY OVERSEAS, 
MARCACCINI RETURNS TO L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bobby Knight is probably still second-guessing his decision to offer Monte 
Marcaccini a basketball scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 A week before he was to report to Indiana last August, Marcaccini decided to 
play in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sherman Oaks Notre Dame High graduate waited until he was in Rome to tell 
Knight. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the toughest phone call I ever had to make," Marcaccini recalls. 
"Here I was an 18-year-old kid telling one of the most respected coaches in the 
game that I wasn't going to take his scholarship after all. I didn't know how 
he was going to react." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcaccini said Knight was "understanding" and wished him the best, although 
the Indiana coach has publicly commented very little on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 After spending 10 months playing for the Benetton junior club team in Treviso 
outside of Venice, Marcaccini returned home to the San Fernando Valley this 
summer in search of a scholarship. Coaches from USC, Arizona, Utah and UNLV, 
among others, have expressed interest, but Knight has not. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Fuller, Pepperdine's new coach, said he has never heard of a top college 
player leaving the country and then returning. That did not stop him from 
pursuing Marcaccini, however, who is expected to sign with the Waves this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 How long Marcaccini will stick around is anyone's guess. He said his goal is 
to earn a degree and to play in the NBA. If that does not happen, he will 
return to Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Marcaccini, 19, was born in Santa Monica but grew up in Rome. His father, 
Giancarlo, is an international businessman specializing in imports and a native 
Italian. His mother, Alicia, grew up in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Until he was in the eighth grade, Marcaccini concentrated his athletic 
endeavors in swimming and he was one of the top juniors in Italy. It was not 
until the family relocated to Tarzana in 1988 that Marcaccini started playing 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to watch basketball on television," he said. "When I finally got the 
chance to play, it became an obsession." 
</P>
<P>
 To make up for lost time, Marcaccini practiced before and after school. It 
helped that his older brother, Giancarlo Jr., was already a top player at Notre 
Dame High, a co-ed parochial school. But Monte, the middle of three boys in the 
family, wanted to establish his own identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Things began coming together his junior season when he averaged 21 points and 
11 rebounds a game, even though Notre Dame struggled to a 10-15 record and was 
eliminated in the first round of the Southern Section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 College coaches had shown limited interest in Marcaccini to that point, but 
that began changing in the summer of 1992 when he had several impressive 
performances with a local traveling team. Recruiters rely heavily on summer 
leagues and all-star games to evaluate talent, and Marcaccini made the most of 
the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the summer, Marcaccini, a 6-foot-5 1/2, 200-pound swingman, had 
received letters from more than 50 Division I colleges. The phone began ringing 
off the hook, with coaches from such schools as UCLA, Utah and Virginia calling 
regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 When Utah Coach Rick Majerus ran out of scholarships, he told Knight, a 
longtime friend, about a top prospect he had seen from Southern California. A 
week later, Marcaccini sent Knight a highlight film and, shortly thereafter, 
visited Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew from the moment I stepped on that campus that I wanted to go to school 
there," Marcaccini said. "It was so beautiful, and you could feel the 
basketball tradition everywhere. A year earlier, no one even knew who I was, 
and now I was being offered a scholarship to Indiana. It was too much too pass 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 Taking advantage of the early signing period in November turned out to be a 
blessing. A month into his senior season, Marcaccini began suffering from 
tendinitis in both knees and found it difficult to stand or run for long 
periods of time. 
</P>
<P>
 The pain became so bad that Marcaccini hardly practiced, saving his energy for 
games. He led the team in scoring and rebounding, and the Knights went on to 
win the section's Division III-A title. 
</P>
<P>
 Several weeks after the championship, Marcaccini played in an all-star game in 
Indianapolis and met several of his new coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the ensuing months, he began considering a return to Italy. The 
country's professional basketball league was growing in popularity, and 
Marcaccini knew it would become increasingly difficult to secure a card that 
would allow him to join one of the teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcaccini has dual citizenship since his father has maintained a home in 
Rome, which eased the restrictions he would have faced trying to join the 
league as a foreigner. His decision was made easier after his brother signed 
with Benetton in July of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Days before he was to report to Indiana, Marcaccini boarded a plane for Italy. 
He immediately began practicing with one of Benetton's developmental squads 
made up of players 20 years and younger. Although the club provided housing and 
meals, Marcaccini received no salary, safeguarding his amateur status in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Benetton is one of the top clubs in Italy and the richest. Former Clipper 
Winston Garland is on the team, as was Rafael Addison, who signed with Detroit 
last month. Both made salaries reportedly in the half-million dollar range. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't play in the professional games, but I certainly practiced against 
the pros everyday," Marcaccini said. "For four hours a day six days a week I 
went up against these guys, and I can't tell you how much tougher and better I 
am than I was last year at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcaccini, whose knees are now healed, said it was frustrating at times 
because the fans do not understand the game well. When he shattered the 
backboard on two different occasions, he said the crowd became upset because of 
the subsequent delays. 
</P>
<P>
 When the season ended after the junior championship in June, Marcaccini went 
to the Rome airport without a ticket and asked for the first available flight 
to Los Angeles. He got stuck in the smoking section but said he was glad to be 
heading home. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcaccini said he spent most of his time with older players and missed being 
around his peers and friends. He said the year away made him lonely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had my reservations about Monte leaving in the first place," his mother 
said "I can't tell you how happy I am that he's back." 
</P>
<P>
 Giancarlo Jr. also left Italy this summer and is hoping to secure a 
scholarship by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Things have been hectic the last two months. Marcaccini has been getting 
reacquainted with family and friends. He joined the Southern California College 
Summer League made up of area players, and his teammates included UCLA-bound 
Toby Bailey and J.R. Henderson. The team, nicknamed "Blue Chip," won the league 
championship game Aug. 7 at Trade Tech College. 
</P>
<P>
 "Monte certainly has improved his skills in the past year," said Ken Krofft, 
Blue Chip's coach. "But the thing I noticed the most is how much he's matured 
off the court. He left a kid and came back a man. He brings that change onto 
the court." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is rare for a school to offer a scholarship in the summer since 
most have been given out by April, Marcaccini said his phone has been ringing 
nonstop. The recruiting pressures have started again. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he has had to worry about the health of his father, who suffers 
from lung cancer and recently had a lung removed in a Paris hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father won't be coming home for a while because of his condition, but when 
he does return I want to be near him," Marcaccini said. "Attending a college 
close to home is certainly a priority." 
</P>
<P>
 If he signs with Pepperdine, Marcaccini is expected to play right away since 
the Waves graduated four starters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll probably be one of the main guys there," he said. "It's a role I'm 
definitely ready for."

WITH FEARS ALLAYED, TROJANS READY TO GO ON TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 USC forward Tremayne Anchrum's reaction was not positive when he first heard 
about the Trojans' nine-game, 17-day basketball tour of Asia. He did not want 
to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been out of the country . . . not even to Hawaii," said Anchrum, a 
6-foot-5 senior who grew up in Montbello, Colo. "Basically, making a long trip 
over water is not something that sounded good to me." 
</P>
<P>
 So, to help Anchrum and his teammates prepare for their trip that begins today 
when the Trojans leave for Hong Kong, USC assistant Adrian Walters had the 
players meet with a group of students and professors familiar with the 
countries they will visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Headed by John Wills, USC's East Asian Study Center director, the group gave 
the players tips on what to wear, eat and buy when they travel to Hong Kong, 
Taipei (Taiwan) and Seoul (South Korea). 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that I'm kind of scared, but now I'm excited to see the different 
cultures," Anchrum said. "This will probably be a cultural experience that I'll 
probably never get again in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 USC, which lost in the first round of the National Invitation Tournament and 
finished with a 16-12 record last season, will play several national teams on 
the tour and will conclude its trip Aug. 30 at the Seoul Olympic Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a trip like this, basketball is kind of secondary," said junior guard 
Brandon Martin, who along with sophomore Jaha Wilson are the only Trojans who 
have played outside the country. "You always want to win but a tour of this 
nature gives us an opportunity to not only be exposed to different things 
culturally but also a chance to come together as a team on a personal basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Lorenzo Orr, a returning All-Pacific 10 performer, will be one of 12 
players making the trip for the Trojans, who will have to play without starting 
point guard Burt Harris, who is sidelined with a foot injury. Stais Boseman, 
who will be academically ineligible for the first month of the regular season, 
will play.

 BUSY PLACE: Does it seem like you get a lot of mail? Orange County homes and 
businesses get an average of six to seven pieces of mail every day, says the 
Postal Service. And that ranks in the top 10 postal districts nationally. "It's 
somewhat a function of demographics," explains Santa Ana plant manager Bob 
Gillis, citing the county's relative affluence and frequent mailings by 
retailers. . . . Overall, the Santa Ana mail center, which processes 8 million 
pieces of mail a day countywide, ranks third among U.S. post offices in number 
of local deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
 NIXON STAMP: Former Presidents generally don't show up on stamps until after 
death -- on their next birthday. So will Jan. 9 bring a Richard Nixon stamp? 
"There will be a Nixon stamp," said Postal Service stamp specialist Monica 
Hand. "What we don't know yet is when." . . . The problem: a 3-cent price hike 
for first-class stamps is pending and might render a new stamp obsolete. So 
where will it be issued on the first day? There's often jockeying over where 
such stamps are first issued, but bet on birthplace Yorba Linda. Postal 
officials haven't picked a location, but they say they'll listen first to 
Nixon's family. 
</P>
<P>
 POLLUTION: One of the few stamps ever unveiled in Orange County was also 
Nixon's doing. In the aftermath of the first Earth Day, the Postal Service on 
Oct. 28, 1970, launched four new anti-pollution stamps. The 6-cent stamps, 
unveiled in San Clemente, then the site of the Western White House, exhorted 
the public to save the nation's water, air and cities. More than 2 million were 
printed for first-day use. 
</P>
<P>
 MAIL HUNT: If you don't like post office window service nowadays, consider the 
plight of San Juan Capistrano residents a century ago. The postmaster, William 
McLaughlin, could barely read. So customers at the post office -- a grocery 
where the El Adobe de Capistrano Restaurant stands now -- had to pick through a 
soapbox to find their mail. . . . At a time when most people wrote in script, 
McLaughlin had a ready excuse, says Orange County historian Jim Sleeper. "He 
claimed he could read only 'coarse print.' "

THEATER REVIEW; POWERFUL, INSPIRING 'LEAR' AT CHAPMAN U'S WALTMAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alan Mandell had plenty of time to rehearse for the granddaddy of 
Shakespearean roles, King Lear. Perhaps he has been rehearsing all his life. At 
times it seems he may have been rehearsing too long.  
</P>
<P>
 When GroveShakespeare in Garden Grove went belly up and shut down suddenly 
last summer, Mandell had been ready and waiting to take on one of the most 
physically and emotionally demanding of all roles; the closing was just days 
shy of his first performance as Lear. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival's closing must have seemed like a cruel joke, like a scenario 
invented by Mandell's old friend Samuel Beckett. Now Shakespeare Orange County 
finally presents the actor at Chapman University's Waltmar Theatre.  
</P>
<P>
 Mandell's is a vocally powerful Lear, inspiring also to see, with his flowing 
white hair and that beautiful tragedian face and those haunted eyes. The bad 
news first: Mandell's Lear is weak in the crucial middle passage, when the King 
first realizes the cataclysmic error he has made in giving his kingdom to his 
two daughters, Goneril and Regan. When he rails against them in the "O, reason 
not the need!" speech, he falls into a kind of Shakespearean oration that is 
pre-Olivier, with much affect and rolling of the Rs but not much psychological 
realism, rather like the kind of Barrymore-ish "ACTing!" that John Lovitz 
mocked on the old "Saturday Night Live."  
</P>
<P>
 As long as he is fighting madness, Mandell's Lear undercuts the perfection of 
his appearance and voice. Things improve once he stops railing -- that is, once 
Lear accepts that he has been shorn of office and authority and is simply 
"unaccommodated man," naked on the heath, facing the elements, his own nature 
and the nature of those who used and betrayed him. Lear can only understand 
power when he is stripped of it and love when he has true need of it. The old 
Lear mistook obedience for love. 
</P>
<P>
 "King Lear" is also about appreciating the value of something that does not 
flatter you -- people in power have such difficulty with that one. When Lear 
asks his daughters to praise him before he divides his land to them, he invites 
insincerity. He cannot hear Cordelia's honest and plain reply amid the 
glittering falsities of her sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Lear revokes her dowry, Cordelia is rejected by the Duke of Burgundy, her 
intended husband, while another suitor, the King of France, looks on in 
disbelief. France sees Cordelia's true worth. "Will you not have her?" he asks 
Burgundy. "She is herself a dowry."  
</P>
<P>
 If Lear could have seen what France sees, he would not be cast out of society 
and into madness. But then he would have already been the man we see him become 
-- wise, compassionate, without vanity. This man Mandell becomes gracefully and 
movingly if not brilliantly. 
</P>
<P>
 The proof that Lear must have been a very good monarch before the play's start 
is in the loyalty that his Fool and that Kent show for him long after they have 
nothing to gain from it. 
</P>
<P>
 As Kent, Carl Reggiardo is a warm big lug, full of decency but with a plebian 
grasp of the meter. Michael Nehring is a strange Fool. With his pudgy physique, 
pigeon-toes and tattooed head, he looks like Dom DeLuise wandering into a "Mad 
Max" movie. He is not a distanced observer but a hysterical Fool who seems to 
take Lear's plight harder than Lear himself. 
</P>
<P>
 For balance's sake, director Thomas F. Bradac might have given us a more 
measured Fool; his distress crowds the play, particularly in the trial scene, 
in which Lear condemns Goneril and Regan in absentia.  
</P>
<P>
 Of the three sisters, Kamella Tate's Regan is the most complex, moving from 
nervous stabs into full-blown evil with the help of hearty cups of mead. Renata 
Florin is a tightly clenched Goneril. Lisa Steele, unfortunately, simply does 
not yet have the chops to attain Cordelia's great stature and goodness.  
</P>
<P>
 As Edmund, the bastard son of Gloucester, Wayne Alexander brings a kind of Rob 
Lowe unctuousness to the role and is quite entertaining. John Shouse as Duke of 
Albany also is quite good. Suzie Goff's set is simple and suggests that Lear's 
kingdom was a barren, mean place from the start, with rough wood planks for 
floors and burlap as a backdrop. The costume design by Lyndall Otto perplexes 
-- it's part Robin Hood, part Ben Hur, part Native American, with tie-up suede 
boots and moccasins and lots of browns.  
</P>
<P>
 The time and setting of director Bradac's Lear may be vague, but that matters 
little when Lear and Cordelia are reunited in a place where forgiveness and 
generosity flow, which we recognize as heaven on earth. No matter what its 
flaws along the way, this Lear gets us there, and that's where we all want to 
be.

IN THE EYE OF THE I AT LACMA; THE IRMAS COLLECTION MIXES PHOTO HISTORY WITH THE 
ECCENTRICITY OF SELF-PORTRAITURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The postcard-size 1967 "Self-Portrait" by Wallace Berman (1926-76) is among 
the smallest of the 140 works in "The Camera I: Photographic Self-Portraits 
From the Audrey and Sydney Irmas Collection," which opened last week at Los 
Angeles County Museum of Art. It is also among the most eccentric. 
</P>
<P>
 A tiny black-and-white picture of the artist, his head surmounted by a Hebrew 
glyph while rays of light emanate from his forehead, is affixed to the center 
of the card. Nine postage stamps and one State of California tax stamp (from a 
pint bottle of unidentified liquor) are affixed around his beatific, slightly 
upraised face. 
</P>
<P>
 The red, green, blue, brown and violet postage stamps themselves carry 
engraved pictures, most associated with travel: a Conestoga wagon, Charles 
Lindbergh's airplane, a lighter-than-air weather balloon and a bicycle. (One 
traveler is a winged angel in flight.) The stamps come from the United States, 
the Falkland Islands, Belgium and Barbados, and several of the pictures are 
graphically marked with rays of light, like those encircling Berman's mind in 
his self-portrait. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The radiant beams give a dramatic, romantic punch to the scenes -- as in the 
triumphant little picture of a 19th-Century family in a Conestoga wagon 
arriving in Utah. They survey a peaceful landscape that unfolds beneath the 
printed legend, "This is the place." 
</P>
<P>
 The stamped card also recalls the artist's well-known habit of sending 
collaged postcards through the mail to friends. Imaginative, exploratory travel 
through time, space and consciousness is conveyed in Berman's simply made, 
conceptually complex image, which marvelously evokes his visionary 
understanding of himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman's self-portrait is not a photograph per se, but a small collage that 
incorporates a photograph among its various elements. As such it speaks of the 
period in contemporary culture when photographic reproductions were being 
rapidly absorbed into art, rather than standing alone as a separate artistic 
category based on medium. If the Irmas collection doesn't include a work by 
Robert Rauschenberg, an artist pivotal to that shift, it does feature a 
four-part, 1964 self-portrait by Andy Warhol, taken in a commercial photo 
booth, as well as two of Cindy Sherman's 1977 "Untitled Film Stills," in which 
she masquerades as generic characters familiar from mass culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Warhol successfully placed camera images at the center of artistic discussion, 
in a way no earlier artist had been able to accomplish, while Sherman went on 
to endow photographs with a stature hitherto reserved for painting. 
</P>
<P>
 In the exhibition, it is revealing to come upon their work after seeing Edward 
Steichen's 1901 photogravure print, "Self-Portrait With Brush and Palette, 
Paris," which hangs near the show's entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 The 22-year-old Steichen, a painter as well as a photographer, shows himself 
as a dandified Romantic artist dipping his prominently illuminated brush into a 
pool of paint -- in a Parisian atelier, no less -- the softened, moody light of 
the portrait plainly meant to imitate painting. (Think of Rembrandt.) The 
aspiration for photography to approach the cultural regard held by painting was 
felt early on, but in fact was a long time in being realized. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irmas collection isn't comprehensive -- there have been too many 
photographers in the past 150 years for a private collection to manage that -- 
but it is remarkable for the full sweep of photographic history implied in its 
contents. 
</P>
<P>
 The earliest picture dates from about 1853 (chemist Alphonse-Louis Poitevin's 
stern, workmanlike image, in which he looks as if he has swallowed a mouthful 
of the salted paper with which the photograph was printed), the latest from 
1988 (Robert Mapplethorpe's skull-like head, taken in the year before his 
death). 
</P>
<P>
 It is also studded with individual pictures of note. Some are well-known 
classics, such as Lee Friedlander's predatory self-portrait, which shows only 
his own shadow cast on the unsuspecting back of a woman on a city street. 
Others are surprises, whether by a major photographer such as Diane Arbus (a 
previously unpublished picture) or by an artist not thought of as a 
photographer (the Berman collage). 
</P>
<P>
 At LACMA, which two years ago was the happy recipient of the Irmas collection, 
a gift of the Los Angeles-based couple, the exhibition has not been installed 
chronologically. (For that, turn to the insightful catalogue published in 
conjunction with the show). Instead, arbitrary sub-categories have been loosely 
fabricated, such as self-portraits of the photographer with members of the 
family, or with a model, or in the studio, or reflected in a shiny surface 
(automobile fenders turn out to be oddly prominent mirrors), or as a fleeting 
shadow, or outlandishly costumed. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the largest sub-category is photographers shown posing with their 
cameras, rather like saints brandishing their attributes. The show opens with a 
roomful, and the subject is encountered again and again throughout the 
presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Weegee's pugilistic picture shows him as a quintessential news hound, ever on 
the lookout for an off-beat story. 
</P>
<P>
 Lotte Jacobi casts herself as an oracular Sibyl peering out of the darkness, 
accompanied by the Cyclopean eye of her big box camera, glinting in the light. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Steiner protectively clutches a camera to his chest as he shows himself 
beneath a towering billboard in which a picture of a man has been partially 
torn off, obscuring his identity. 
</P>
<P>
 As a sub-category of self-portraits, this one is the most intriguing. It makes 
a difference when photographers picture themselves not simply as men or women 
but, pointedly, as photographers.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; ISLEY LOVE SIZZLES ON STAGE DURING GIG AT GREEK THEATRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There were moments during the Isley Brothers' show on Saturday at the Greek 
Theatre when one felt like an eavesdropper on someone else's love affair. 
</P>
<P>
 The mid-portion of its act was devoted to the appearance of Angela Winbush, a 
sultry singer with an impressive vocal range who recently married group leader 
Ronald Isley.On Saturday their passionate embraces on stage were as hot as the 
temperature itself at the outdoor theater. 
</P>
<P>
 In a career that spans more than 30 years, the Isleys have written enough good 
music to keep themselves and at least two or three other acts in business. 
While "Love Is a Wonderful Thing," the song at the center of their recent legal 
bout with Michael Bolton, was not performed, the trio drew the wildest applause 
for two of the oldest songs in its repertoire, "Twist and Shout" and "Shout." 
</P>
<P>
 While Ronald Isley seemed to be struggling with throat problems for much of 
the evening, Winbush was in fine form. Mariah Carey and Toni Braxton are 
better-known singers, but Winbush is their equal, particularly when armed with 
an emotion-packed ballad like "Angel." 
</P>
<P>
 The underrated Bobby Womack opened the bill with a lean and efficiently 
performed set that was long on old-school finesse. Womack is a waste as 
anybody's opening act. He's worthy of headliner status, as he ably proved on 
Saturday. CONNIE JOHNSON

COUNTERPUNCH: TV ISN'T THE MAJOR CULPRIT OF 'TEEN' SEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE MALES, Mike Males is a writer and graduate student in social ecology at 
the University of California, Irvine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rick Du Brow is concerned with the possible corruption of "impressionable" 
youths watching "adult" shows containing sexual content and suggests these 
programs might contribute to rising rates of unwed and teen-age motherhood 
("Sex on TV: The Children Are Watching," Calendar, July 30). One suggestion 
from Du Brow was to schedule these shows at hours "kids" would not be watching. 
</P>
<P>
 But let's not be so quick to blame young people. 
</P>
<P>
 Birth figures from the California Center for Health Statistics show that, for 
example, in 1990 there were 155,891 births to unwed parents in which the age of 
the parents was known. Of these, 115,201 involved two adult partners age 20 or 
older, 26,231 involved a teen-age partner and a partner 20 or older, and just 
14,459 (less than 10%) involved two teen-age partners. That's right -- adults 
age 20 and older are involved in roughly 90% of all unwed births in the state, 
including 64% of births involving teen-agers. Every week in this state, adults 
over age 20 are involved in 600 unwed births among teen-agers; adults over age 
25, in 135 such births. 
</P>
<P>
 If your reaction is, "Wait a minute, I thought teen-age girls and boys were 
having babies with each other," you share a commonly held, understandable 
misimpression. Neither officials nor the media have publicized what decades of 
U.S. and California birth records through 1992 show: 70% of the partners in 
"teen" births are over age 20. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the worst of the issue, however. When it comes to rape and sexual 
abuse, the male offenders who victimize children and young teen-agers average 
about 30 years old. Recent studies have found that for 60% of the so-called 
"sexually active" girls under age 14, their only sexual experience has been a 
rape. Overwhelmingly, these were committed by adult men. Two-thirds of all 
teen-age mothers were victimized by rape or sexual abuse while growing up by 
men averaging 27 years of age. 
</P>
<P>
 Men age 20 and older thus father a large majority of all "teen-age" births, 
both in and out of wedlock. Typically, the fathers are much older than the 
teen-age mothers. A substantial majority of the fathers involved with mothers 
of junior and senior high school age (age 11 to 18) are adult men of post-high 
school age. And adult men inflict the vast majority of all rapes and sexual 
abuses upon children and young teens. Similar statistics show adults account 
for large majorities of sexually transmitted diseases and nearly all AIDS cases 
in children and youths as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming (as Du Brow does) that TV and movie sex influences real-life sexual 
behavior, we should be equally if not more concerned about adults (even those 
over age 30) viewing sexually oriented programs and movies than we are about 
"kids." Switching these shows to later hours would not solve anything. The 
question from real-life behavior, then, is not whether "kids" should see these 
shows, but whether anyone of any age should see them. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe strong questions should be raised as to why the media rarely discuss 
these adult-teen and adult-youth sexual issues. Du Brow rightly argues that if 
irresponsible sexual behavior is shown, its consequences should be shown as 
well. Yet every year in the United States, some 700,000 "teen" pregnancies, as 
well as hundreds of thousands of rapes and sexual abuses inflicted upon young 
girls (and boys), occur by men over age 20. 
</P>
<P>
 The media have never publicly held adult men accountable. The consequences of 
the overwhelming reality of adult-teen sex are shown only occasionally and as 
aberrations (typically involving celebrities), when in fact they are the 
central issues in what we call "teen" pregnancy, "teen" AIDS and "teen" 
parenting. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems to me media critics have strong reason to criticize the broadcast 
media not only for their utter failure to cover this issue, but also for their 
documentaries, news programs and fictional programs, which inevitably imply 
that teen-age boys are the fathers in most "teen-age" births, while ignoring 
the enormous role of both rape and voluntary sex involving adult men in the 
sexual initiation and pregnancies of young girls. 
</P>
<P>
 For the teen mothers I have interviewed, their histories of sexual abuses and 
the sexual advances they received (again, predominantly from adult men) had far 
more influence on their thinking and behavior than anything they saw on the TV 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
 We also have great reason to be concerned about the example set by adult men 
influencing boys, who, as they age into late adolescence, imitate their elders' 
pattern of sexual contact with younger females. Yet the media have spent far 
more time debating the effects of fictional media images upon youth behavior 
than the effects of real-life beatings and rapes inflicted upon young people, 
and the examples set, by adults.

COUNTERPUNCH: 'HEARTBEATS' LOOKS AT LOVE LINKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMANDA McBROOM, Amanda McBroom is the author-composer of the musical 
Heartbeats, in which she also appears. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wow! I was amazed to read the Counterpunch piece by Cheryl Layne Farrell 
concerning my musical play, "Heartbeats," currently playing at the Pasadena 
Playhouse ("An Out of Sync 'Heartbeats,' " Calendar, Aug. 1). Who knew I was 
writing such a controversial piece of theater? My total intention in the 
writing of this piece was to create a gentle, sometimes humorous look at the 
dilemma that exists between men and woman of my generation as we struggle down 
the road of connubial compatibility. There has never been anything of a 
racially derogatory nature in this piece. That she should perceive it so alarms 
me. 
</P>
<P>
 It illustrates yet again the terrible danger we currently face of losing one 
of the few saving attributes we possess . . . the ability to laugh at 
ourselves, and through laughter, to heal. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl Farrell is obviously an intelligent and concerned woman. But her 
examples of my misguided racism confuse me. I was not aware that no one other 
than a black person was allowed to write or sing a blues song, one of my 
favorite musical forms. Someone please tell Bonnie Raitt to stop doing what she 
does so well. For that matter, perhaps Lena Horne and Kathleen Battle . . . 
even better . . . Whitney Houston, had better cease and desist from performing 
songs written by anyone other than their peers. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell also took exception to one fragment of one of my lyrics in which the 
lead character asks, hypothetically and humorously, "If I tell him how I feel, 
do I think he'd hit me with an ax?" I wrote this song three years before the 
unfortunate court case to which she refers that now so mesmerizes and polarizes 
this city. 
</P>
<P>
 This play is not about spousal abuse. It is very obviously about lack of 
communication between the sexes and, in the end, resolves in a nonviolent and 
hopeful manner. Am I, as she suggests, to rewrite my play because she 
misinterprets an intention no one else has found objectionable? Does the word 
censorship rear its ugly head here? Is political correctness now the polite 
term for thought control? 
</P>
<P>
 The play was not to her taste. Fine. Many audience members are enjoying 
themselves to the utmost. The people who do, laugh, cry and leave the theater 
holding hands and talking to each other and not about abuse and intolerance, 
which is not the purpose of the piece, but about each other, which is .

JAZZ; LONG BEACH FESTIVAL A FEELING OF DEJA VU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Woodstock wasn't the only place for flashbacks last weekend. The Long Beach 
Jazz Festival at the city's Rainbow Lagoon Park had its share of deja vu, as 
many of the performers on the three-day bill made their third, fourth or even 
fifth appearance in the fest's seven-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Friday's three acts, Keiko Matsui made her third Long Beach appearance 
and headliner Dianne Reeves was there for the fifth time. Saturday saw repeat 
performances from pianist Ramsey Lewis, saxophonist Kirk Whalum and vocalist 
Barbara Morrison. Perennial favorite Poncho Sanchez, who closed last year's 
Sunday edition, provided this year's second-day finale. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, it was the veteran Long Beach performers who carried the show 
Saturday, with first-timers Gato Barbieri, Bobby Caldwell and Oscar Brown Jr. 
delivering the weakest moments. Most disappointing was Barbieri, whose overtly 
macho tenor sounds fell as flat as a well-worn barroom come-on. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbieri's familiar, gravelly tone was applied to simple lines that built 
predictably into screams and caterwauls, broken only by simple trills and his 
own vocal exclamations. There was little subtlety in his play, and his set, 
coming at the hottest part of the afternoon, would have been a total wash had 
it not been for fine play from keyboardist Bill O'Connell and bassist Nielson 
Matta. 
</P>
<P>
 The day's hit was third-timer Ramsey Lewis' quartet, with its fine blend of 
jazz-funk and straight-ahead standards. Lewis, still a satisfying soloist, 
built improvisations from simple statements into harmonically rich, 
rhythmically enticing lines.  
</P>
<P>
 Also impressive were saxophonist Whalum, the Sanchez band, and blues and 
ballad vocalist Morrison. 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach Jazz Festival was scheduled to conclude Sunday with George 
Howard, Joe Williams, David Benoit, Tania Maria and others.

COUNTERPUNCH: CRITICS SHOULDN'T DICTATE 'LOCA'S' ARTISTIC CONTENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLISON ANDERS, Allison Anders, who wrote and directed Mi Vida Loca, was 
often in trouble as a teen-age runaway from Kentucky and was a young, single 
mother when she enrolled in UCLA Film School, supporting herself as a waitress. 
At UCLA, she became a prize-winning screenwriter. In 1993, she was named best 
new director by the New York Film Critics Assn. for her film, Gas Food Lodging. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I would normally never write a response to a review of my work as a 
writer-director of films, because I respect and admire good, fair film 
criticism and, being a humanist, I realize film criticism is an opinion, and 
everyone is entitled to their own. Kevin Thomas' review of my new film, "Mi 
Vida Loca" ("The Road to 'Mi Vida Loca' Paved With Good Intentions," Calendar, 
July 22), was by no means the most vicious I've ever received as a director, 
but it is the one that has disturbed me the most deeply. 
</P>
<P>
 I have long feared a climate of liberal McCarthyism that would attempt to 
dictate the focus, characters, and tone of my work and the works of my friends 
and other filmmakers we admire. This climate I feared would masquerade as 
radicalism and political correctness, but would in fact be racist, sexist, 
classist, imperialist and reactionary. Thomas' shockingly unfair review of my 
film proves that day has come. 
</P>
<P>
 While posing as an indignant representative of Latino Power, he in fact will 
only accept a white middle-class male view of Latinos: He wants them to have 
ambition as he defines it, he wants them to seek love he considers worthy, he 
wants them to aspire to his ideals, he wants them to have his options. In 
effect, he would like to see a mirror of his own life projected onto this 
subculture that has defined itself against his very power structure, the one 
that repeatedly denies them access to his options. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas was offended by the fact that my characters, Latina gang girls -- some 
of whom are teen-age mothers -- are welfare dependent. If PCs like Thomas were 
a bit more offended by men and boys abandoning pregnant women and their 
children, there would be no welfare dependency. And, speaking from experience 
as a teen-age welfare mother, I can assure everyone that the demoralization 
that comes with your AFDC check on the 1st and the 15th of every month is far 
more offensive than what he may consider an unfair onscreen representation. I 
would have given the moon to see a mother with food stamps on the screen when I 
was a teen-age kid with a baby to feed -- instead, all I got to see were 
options available to him, not to me. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't discuss my filmmaking in the least, which is his job as a critic, 
and he did not address my audience. Instead, he ranted. And his rant concluded 
that because I am white, I cannot and should not make films outside of my race. 
This is where his review becomes dangerous. Are we filmmakers going to be 
confined now by his fascistic code? Like the Hays Office, he seems to call for 
morality plays and solutions and "ways out." Must we also provide an upbeat 
ending? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the gang girls all buy property in the end, and become real estate 
whizzes and really own their barrios. Maybe they buy a pizza parlor -- and the 
sequel could be a kind of "Mystic Pizza" in Echo Park: "La Pizza Loca." 
</P>
<P>
 I couldn't agree more with Thomas that there needs to be more diverse voices 
heard in the film community. But, unlike the vision he has of what films they'd 
produce might show (stories of their own people), I'd be thrilled to see a 
black man take on making a film about my life. No one, unfortunately, will get 
to see these movies, as long as film criticism is dominated by white males who 
insist every film conform to their experience of entitlement. And if I am to be 
confined to only make films about my own race, gender, and class, then I demand 
to be reviewed by white working-class gals from Kentucky who were raised by 
single mothers and were themselves single welfare mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 My job as a filmmaker is to present what I know and observe, imagine and 
intuit, not to moralize, judge or offer solutions. However, as a citizen and 
member of the community I can do my part to help encourage options. I lent my 
Los Angeles premiere of "Mi Vida Loca" as a benefit to set up an education fund 
for the gang kids in the Echo Park community through El Centro Del Pueblo and 
for IFP West's Project Involve, which offers a mentorship program for young 
women from racially diverse backgrounds to develop a filmmaking voice -- the 
money from my benefit has solely financed their film project. I am also the 
very proud foster mother of a 4-year-old son (whom I'm in the process of 
adopting) who was orphaned when his 19-year-old mother, an Echo Park gang 
member and actress in "Mi Vida Loca," died from a drug overdose. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas is wrong when he says I am a woman of good intentions. I am a woman of 
action.

SCREENING ROOM: LENI'S 'MAN WHO LAUGHS' A SILENT, STIRRING EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 German director Paul Leni's best-known U.S. film is "The Cat and the Canary" 
(1927), the horror-suspense classic, but his American masterpiece is the rarely 
seen "The Man Who Laughs" (1928), which screens Wednesday at 8 p.m. at the 
Silent Movie. Adapted from the Victor Hugo novel, it is precisely the kind of 
all-stops-out romantic adventure that needs the silent rather than sound medium 
for its maximum impact. In Leni it found its perfect director, for his bravura 
Expressionist style lifts this tempestuous tale above the level of tear-jerker 
to genuinely stirring experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Conrad Veidt, another ideal choice, stars as a man who in childhood had his 
face surgically altered to give him a permanent smile; it was part of his dire 
fate to have been the heir of a nobleman who rebelled against the rule of 
Britain's King James II. He and another orphan, a blind girl Dea (Mary 
Philbin), have been raised by a kindly strolling player (Stroheim favorite 
Cesare Gravina), and now form a part of a popular clown troupe. 
</P>
<P>
 The beautiful Dea loves Veidt's Gwynplaine, but even though she cannot see his 
grotesque countenance, he feels unworthy of any woman -- until he catches the 
attention of a wanton, dangerous duchess (Olga Baclanova) in the frumpy Queen 
Anne's stultified court. Amid superbly designed settings the tormented 
Gwynplaine and the innocent Dea meet their destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a blue-ribbon week for the Silent Movie, presenting on Friday and 
Saturday at 8 p.m. a double feature of rare and major Ernst Lubitsch films, 
"The Marriage Circle" (1924) and "One Arabian Night" (1921).  
</P>
<P>
 One of the director's personal favorites, "The Marriage Circle," is one of the 
earliest sophisticated films in the American cinema, a comedy of manners set in 
motion when the unhappily married and flirtatious Mizzi (Marie Prevost), newly 
arrived in Vienna, looks up her old friend Charlotte (Florence Vidor), who 
heretofore has enjoyed idyllic wedded bliss (not to mention immense wealth) 
with the tall and elegant Franz (Monte Blue).  
</P>
<P>
 Lubitsch and Pola Negri, who began working together in Europe, were as great a 
team as DeMille and Swanson, their rivals at Paramount. Made in Germany in 1920 
as "Sumurun," "One Arabian Night," stars Negri as a fearless Gypsy dancer and 
Lubitsch himself as the hunchbacked clown proprietor of a band of entertainers. 
Determined to vamp the mighty sheik (Paul Wegener, famed as "The Golem"), Negri 
arrives in Baghdad as part of Lubitsch's caravan. A production elaborate to the 
point of campiness, "One Arabian Night" plays like a rowdy spoof of heady harem 
tales -- only to have Lubitsch deftly turns the tables for an unexpectedly 
poignant finish.

 Lively: A series of Hong Kong pictures commences Wednesday at the Monica 
4-Plex with a one-week run of "Drunken Master II," a lively if rambling sequel 
to the 1978 film that established Jackie Chan as a martial arts star; this time 
he's trying to prevent a nasty Brit from smuggling a piece of imperial jade out 
of China. The film's turn-of-century sense of period is as wobbly as Chan's 
disarming style of combat, referred to in the film's title. Chan at 40 is in 
great shape but a little old to play the son of gorgeous and witty Anita Mui. 
</P>

 Information: (310) 394-9741. 
</P>
<P>
 Focused: Soraya Mire's straightforward one-hour documentary "Fire Eyes" (opens 
Friday at the Sunset 5, at 1 p.m. daily for one week only) brings even greater 
focus and information than the recent "Warrior Marks" on the horrors of female 
genital mutilation, a practice that began in ancient Egypt and remains 
prevalent today in Northeast Africa, Malaysia and parts of India. (It is 
estimated that there are today between 80 million and 100 million women who 
have suffered this fate.) 
</P>
<P>
 Mire's film is at once a personal testament -- she was subjected to 
circumcision and infibulation at 13 in her native Somalia -- and a call for an 
end to this life-endangering custom that causes women hideous, enduring pain 
and chronic health problems. Mire's film makes clear what a formidable task it 
will be to stop it, for it is so ingrained in various and widespread cultures 
and it requires a change in the way men regard women as well as the way women 
regard themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 A Somali man, who cannot understand why anyone would want to do away with such 
a cruel, sexist tradition, remarks, "You have to have a door on your house . . 
. you can't leave your door open. The same with women."

POP MUSIC REVIEW; JUST ANOTHER HO-HUM DAY AT THE BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first question to be asked at Friday's "Great American Concert" at the 
Hollywood Bowl was whether John Mauceri would challenge his Hollywood Bowl 
Orchestra -- as well as his audience -- with music that offered any intriguing 
new directions. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer: Been there, done that. 
</P>
<P>
 The second question was how much vigor could be injected into an increasingly 
somnambulistic presentation by the arrival of New Orleans singer Banu Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer: Too little and too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the treasury of American music, both familiar and unfamiliar, that is 
available to Mauceri, it's difficult to understand why he elected to assemble a 
program in which the two showcase works were an eminently forgettable set of 
rediscovered Kurt Weill songs and a glossy Jerome Kern suite based on music 
from "Show Boat." 
</P>
<P>
 Baritone Gregg Baker and 8-year-old Kirby Hanlon sang convincingly in the 
Weill material (drawn from a reworking of "Huckleberry Finn"), and the Kern 
suite was executed with typically brisk efficiency. But aside from some hard 
fiddling in a Carmen Dragon arrangement of "Oh! Susanna," the orchestra's 
performance was little more than another day at the office. 
</P>
<P>
 Any chance that Gibson -- a powerful, blues-driven belter -- might have juiced 
up the evening dissolved when it became clear that she and her New Orleans Hot 
Jazz band would also be accompanied by the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson did her best, especially on "Get Happy" and "Hallelujah!," but the 
absence of a continuing interaction with her band -- an essential part of her 
better performances -- and too many swing-killing orchestral interludes fatally 
undercut her musical impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowl attendance on Friday was 14,878; Saturday's sold-out attendance was 
17,979.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; CASE'S DUALISM FINDS MAGIC IN MUNOZ'S MODE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Do you prefer Peter Case the folk revivalist of the late '80s, or might you be 
a stickler for Peter Case the blissfully tuneful garage-rocker of the late '70s 
and early '80s? 
</P>
<P>
 These being the accommodating mid-'90s, you get 'em both: The 
singer-songwriter's latest release is "Peter Case Sings Like Hell," an acoustic 
album of mostly old blues tunes on the folk-oriented Vanguard label.Yet he's 
also reconciled enough to rock to have reunited his old group, the Plimsouls, 
for a rerecording of their signature song "A Million Miles Away," as heard on 
the "Speed" soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
 Case didn't sing "Miles" or all that much of the "Like Hell" collection on 
Friday at McCabe's, yet both sides of his musical personality were abundantly 
represented. An hour-plus opening set found him in solo-troubadour form, 
resurrecting the Stanley Brothers, Blind Willie McTell and the Civil War era 
and drawing upon his own narrative ballads, many of them unreleased. 
</P>
<P>
 An even longer second set was devoted to reasonably thrashy electric-band 
format, with Case and rhythm section eventually being joined for six numbers by 
Plimsouls guitar commando Eddie Munoz. Rewarding as Case is on his own, bona 
fide magic kicked in with Munoz's first tremolo appearance on the post-quake 
L.A. anthem "This Town's a Riot," excitingly shifting the show from dust-bowl 
to temblor mode. CHRIS WILLMAN

'BROTHERS GRUNT' A REASON TO SAY 'UGH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Brothers Grunt," a new animated series premiering on MTV tonight at 7 and 
11:30, attempts to wrench the vulgar-and-tasteless crown from "Beavis and 
Butt-head." It's an effortful, sophomoric half-hour that leaves the viewer 
longing for the refined good taste of Alice Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
 The title characters -- Perry, Frank, Tony, Bing, Dean and Sammy -- are 
siblings raised by the Secret Order of the Grunt. As they're being inducted 
into the Order (a ceremony that involves rubbing their faces with a duck's 
behind), the monks realize that Perry is destined to be their next leader. But 
Perry gets flushed away during the ceremony, so the other five are sent to find 
him. Clad in boxer shorts, knee socks and wingtips, they dash about in a series 
of disjointed vignettes between rock videos. 
</P>
<P>
 Visually, "Brothers" suggests a Saturday morning kidvid show on LSD. The 
colors are garish; the designs are wincingly ugly. The animation jerks from 
distorted pose to distorted pose. The close-ups of stretching tongues, bulging 
veins, popping eyeballs and mucus-encrusted nostrils would be tasteless at any 
hour, but at 7 p.m., they're inexcusable. Parents who dislike "Beavis and 
Butt-head" won't want their children exposed to gags about used condoms, 
urinals, police beatings, sagging breasts and stretched nipples. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Brothers Grunt" was created by Danny Antonucci, who gained a certain 
notoriety on the festival circuit for "Lupo the Butcher," in which a 
gutter-mouthed meat cutter hacked himself to pieces amid fountains of blood. 
His talent continues to develop.CHARLES SOLOMON

 STILL OFF-LIMITS: Nearly a year after the slaying of Thousand Oaks nurse 
Kellie O'Sullivan, a 400-page grand jury transcript that prosecutors used to 
link suspect Mark Scott Thornton to the case is still unavailable to the public 
(B1). . . . First Amendment experts say Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath

 CAPITOL VISIT: Ten years old may be a bit young to schmooze with politicians 
in Sacramento, but Newbury Park fifth-grader Keith Goss will be doing just that 
today. . . . Keith won an essay contest sponsored by Assemblyman Nao Takasugi 
(R-Oxnard) -- and top prize for his piece on tackling homelessness was a day in 
the Capitol. He got some of his essay ideas from the two nights he spent at a 
shelter last winter. "They were kind," he said of his shelter companions.

 EYES SKYWARD: The recent spate of astronomical phenomena -- Jupiter's 
spectacular encounter with comet fragments and last week's Perseid meteor 
shower -- has even the most grounded Earthlings looking to the heavens. But for 
amateur astronomers, stargazing has long been a pleasurable pastime. . . . One 
prime spot for scanning the skies is 8,200-foot-high Mt. Pinos in Frazier Park 
(B1). As many as 300 stargazers converge there on weekends -- many with their 
own high-powered telescopes. "When I'm looking out there, I'm imagining someone 
else looking back," said Amos Almeida of Moorpark.

<P>
 BEACH TRAFFIC: On these hot August days, the traffic jams on the main roads to 
Ventura County's beaches are bigger than ever. . . . One question to Street 
Smart (B1) is whether the summer gridlock in Ventura could be improved by 
redirecting beach traffic from the Seaward Avenue off-ramp from the Ventura 
Freeway to the San Jon Road off-ramp. . . . But Caltrans Engineer Bob Houle 
says that would make matters even worse.

SPLASH FALTERS AGAINST SACRAMENTO, 6-5, AS TRIP GOES ON

 The journey that was supposed to be critical to the Splash's drive for an 
indoor soccer championship finally turned nasty. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning the first two games of what will be a seven-game trip, the 
Splash was beaten by Sacramento, 6-5, in front of 6,754 Sunday at Arco Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash (15-6) remained in first place, 1 1/2 games in front of San Diego 
(14-8), and are 5-5 in road games. Third-place Sacramento (13-8) is two games 
behind the Splash in the Continental Indoor Soccer League's Western Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento scored 49 seconds into the fourth quarter to take a 5-3 lead, but 
the Splash tied the score 5 1/2 minutes later after goals by Shane Hickson and 
Raffaele Ruotolo. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerell Elliott scored the decisive goal 7:12 into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The trip) is going to be tough, but nothing is insurmountable," Splash 
forward Rod Castro said. "Winning on the road shows you have character and can 
overcome adverse situations." 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash certainly faced adverse conditions, and should take some solace in 
its performance after having played San Diego a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Hickson was playing in place of Armando Valdivia, who missed his second 
consecutive game after spraining his knee last week. Valdivia, the Splash's 
fourth-leading point-scorer, is expected to miss two to three weeks. Also 
absent was Dale Ervine, who leads the team with 25 goals and is second in total 
points; he sprained his big toe during the Splash's 12-8 victory over San Diego 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruotolo scored his 26th and 27th goals of the year. His first, a power-play 
goal, tied the score, 1-1, at 7:19 of the first quarter, and his second tied 
the score, 5-5, with 6:04 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruotolo also assisted Rod Castro's 25th goal, which tied the score, 2-2. With 
it, Ruotolo extended his CISL record to 22 consecutive games with an assist, 10 
more than the previous record. It was his 28th assist of the year, three more 
than he had in his previous five years as a professional. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento led, 3-2, at halftime before Doug Neely tied the score 4:50 into 
the third quarter. Neely, who scored three goals against San Diego, scored for 
the 21st time. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Black had three assists, and Bobby Reyes also had an assist. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was the first for goalkeeper Ruben Fernandez, who made his second 
start of the season. He faced 27 shots and made 15 saves. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight goalie Mike Dowler faced 40 shots and made 10 saves. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss snapped the Splash's four-game winning streak and was the team's 
second loss in eight games. The victory for Sacramento was the Knights' 
franchise-record 13th, and it was their 11th in 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento also had a franchise-record 25 blocks, including seven by Freddie 
Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the loss, the Splash has gotten off to a great start on the trip. 
Coach George Fernandez said before victories in Phoenix against Arizona and 
Saturday at San Diego that a 4-3 record on the trip would be a good one. He 
also said his team needed at least one victory over Arizona, San Diego or 
Sacramento. He got victories over two of the three. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash has one more game against a Western Division opponent during the 
seven-game span; the trip ends against Las Vegas, but the team plays the next 
night at home against Sacramento on Aug. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's just like having a road game," Fernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the trip should get easier with games against three Eastern Division 
teams, Carolina (2-18), Pittsburgh (11-10) and Washington (8-9).

BULLFROGS LOSE TO EDMONTON IN LAST GAME BEFORE PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs ended the Roller Hockey International regular season looking 
like anything but the league's defending champions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs fell to the host Edmonton Sled Dogs, 6-5, Sunday, and have lost 
five of their last six games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs finished 13-8-1 and in third place in the Pacific Division. They 
open the playoffs Thursday at San Jose. The teams conclude the two-game series 
Friday in Anaheim. If the teams split, a 12-minute mini-game follows Friday to 
decide the series winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles won the division and San Jose finished second. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonton (9-10) led at the half, 4-1, and Mark Souch scored 28 seconds into 
the fourth quarter to put the Sled Dogs ahead, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs got goals from Ken Murchison and Rick Judson in the fourth 
quarter. Judson, who scored three goals, trimmed the lead to one at 5 minutes 
24 seconds, but the Bullfrogs got no closer. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonton's Rob McKinley made 52 saves, including 13 in the fourth quarter.

SHOP TALK: TERMINATED PROBATIONARY WORKER SEEKS OVERTIME PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Do you have a question about an on-the-job situation? If so, please mail it 
to Shop Talk, Los Angeles Times, P.O. Box 2008, Costa Mesa, Calif. 92626. Or 
call (714) 966-7873 and leave a voice mail message. Questions of general 
interest will be answered in this column on Mondays. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: I was recently employed as an operational supervisor. During my 
90-day probation I worked a lot of overtime, for which I was not paid. Before 
the end of the first 90 days my job was terminated. Is there any recourse I can 
follow? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The answer depends upon whether you were an exempt employee for 
overtime purposes at the time. Because your title was operational supervisor, 
it may be that you were an exempt executive employee. If you were exempt, you 
would only be entitled to overtime if your employer had promised orally or in 
writing some compensation for extra hours worked. If you were not exempt, you 
would have a claim for overtime under state and perhaps federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 You could pursue any valid claims for overtime with the state labor 
commissioner. In Orange County the number is (714) 558-4111. 
</P>
<P>
 As to the question of your termination, the answer depends on whether you were 
terminated for reasons that violated your employer's contract or various 
discrimination laws. You should seek legal counsel to determine whether you 
have any rights that may have been violated.

 Question: Since being laid off in April, I have been unable to contact the 
pension fund representative at my former company. She is unavailable and has 
been avoiding me, as well as others, who have attempted to get forms or 
information. I suspect the company is unfunded and stalling long enough to move 
all of its operations across the border. The company has manufacturing 
operations in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Mexico. Is there a governmental body 
regulating pension funds or am I on my own in attempting to collect? 
</P>
<P>
 -- J.A., San Clemente 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The U.S. Department of Labor enforces federal laws relating to 
pensions and benefit programs through the Pension and Welfare Benefits 
Administration. Call the Federal Information Center toll-free at (800) 726-4995 
for further information. However, the government can only provide limited help. 
</P>
<P>
 To collect what is owed you, you will almost certainly have to consult an 
attorney who specializes in this area. It is important that you act quickly, 
because some benefit plans impose rather quick deadlines for filing claims. For 
assistance in finding an attorney, call the Orange County Bar Assn. Lawyer 
Referral Service at (714) 835-8811.

 Question: I have been approached by another company about accepting a job. 
Though I am not dissatisfied with my current position, a chance for a promotion 
and more money is very enticing. At what point should I inform my current 
employer that I am talking to another firm and possibly considering another 
job? 
</P>
<P>
 -- J.H., Rancho Santa Margarita 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Unless you want to use the possibility of taking another position as a 
bargaining tool with your current employer, I cannot think of any reason why 
you need to inform your employer that you are simply looking at alternative 
employment possibilities and your own career development. The time to inform 
your employer is when you have already made a decision to accept another job. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, unless you have agreed to some company policy governing 
termination notice, the amount of notice you give is up to you. The rule of 
thumb for minimum notice is two weeks, but you may want to give a longer notice 
if you think that your leaving would cause your current employer a hardship. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is the way I look at the situation: Exploring career alternatives is a 
worker's prerogative. It is also your own personal business, as long as you do 
it on your own time and it does not interfere with your current position. When 
a decision is made to leave an employer for work elsewhere, providing 
reasonable notice so that it does not inconvenience your employer just makes 
good sense. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't want to burn any bridges -- you might need good references from 
previous employers down the line. Of course, there are risks involved if you 
give too much notice and your employer gets upset and decides to terminate you 
before the date you planned.

 Question: I am a non-exempt employee for a major freight express company. I'm 
paid a night differential because I work the graveyard shift. I worked a 
holiday, July 4, and the company said that because I was already getting paid 
at a special rate compared to my normal rate of pay, they wouldn't pay the 
differential. Is that legal? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Neither federal nor California law expressly requires employers to pay 
night-shift differentials on holidays. This would instead be a matter of 
contract between you and your employer that likely would be determined by a 
collective bargaining agreement, if your are represented by a union, or by your 
employer's written policies or unwritten customs and practices. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are union-represented, you should take this up with your union steward. 
If you are not, you should review your employee handbook and any other policies 
your company may have regarding holiday pay and night-shift differentials. 
</P>
<P>
 If there are no written policies, try to find out from other employees working 
the night shift if they had been paid the differential on holidays in the past. 
If you are not union-represented and you still feel you may have a valid claim, 
the office of the labor commissioner may be able to assist you.

HOT JOBS: WORK'S CHALLENGES KEEP ELECTRICIAN ENERGIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE L. JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sunrise Electric owner Clayton Harllee enjoys the challenge of working with 
his hands and building a steady customer base for his electrical contracting 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a one-man operation and sometimes that means lots of extra hours taking 
care of the business side of things, but the work is steady and there's always 
something new to learn," said Harllee, who opened his business five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Harllee began working as an electrician while attending college. "A friend of 
mine owned his own firm and he was able to give me flexible hours that allowed 
me to work and go to school," Harllee said. "I studied German and computer 
science. But after graduation, I went to work for a couple of corporations and 
decided that I really liked being an electrician, since the work is different 
almost every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Harllee took the Contractors State License Board examination to become an 
electrical contractor and opened Sunrise Electric in 1989. "There are small 
jobs and big jobs," Harllee said. "There are also emergency jobs that keep you 
out until late at night." 
</P>
<P>
 On a typical day, Harllee, whose clients include homeowners, restaurants and 
apartment complexes, begins work at 6 a.m. After going over some paperwork, he 
plans the day's jobs according to priority and extent of the work. Then he 
visits the sites. "If I need to, I leave to go pick up any supplies that are 
needed. Then I come back and make sure everything is done up to code." 
OCCUPATION: Electrician 
</P>
<P>
 * What's involved: Planning and installing electrical wiring for commercial 
and industrial buildings, homes and other structures; connecting machinery, 
repairing existing wiring and conducting electricity management studies for 
large power users. 
</P>
<P>
 * Qualifications: Apprentices with little or no experience may begin working 
under the supervision of a licensed electrical contractor. In some areas, there 
are union-sponsored training programs. Community colleges also offer courses in 
wiring procedures, electrical codes and laws. After four years' experience, an 
apprentice becomes a journeyman electrician. One year at this level meets the 
work-experience requirement for an electrical contractor's license. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: By 1998, the number of electricians in the county is projected to 
increase by 8.5% to 3,590. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salary range: $8 to $23 per hour. Electricians who own their firms usually 
earn $35,000 per year and up. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pros: Working in a variety of job environments. A wide array of specialties 
makes careers varied and increasingly challenging. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cons: Possibility of electrocution, explosions and fires. 
</P>
<P>
 * Advancement: Journeyman electricians with five years' experience may become 
electrical contractors by passing a state examination. At this point, many opt 
to open their own business. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quote: "There's always something to learn. Nearly every project presents a 
different challenge." -- Clayton Harllee, Sunrise Electric

ENCORE ARTISTS STAR AT FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Woodstock wasn't the only place for flashbacks this weekend. The Long Beach 
Jazz Festival, in the city's comely Rainbow Lagoon Park, had its share of deja 
vu as many of the performers on the three-day bill made their third, fourth or 
even fifth appearances in the fest's seven-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Friday's three acts, Keiko Matsui was there for the third time and 
headliner Dianne Reeves was there for the fifth time. Saturday saw repeat 
performances by pianist Ramsey Lewis, saxophonist Kirk Whalum and singer 
Barbara Morrison. Perennial favorite Poncho Sanchez, who closed last year's 
Sunday edition, provided this year's second day finale. Could there be too much 
"if it ain't broke, don't fix it" at work here? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe not. It was the veteran fest performers who carried the Saturday show; 
first-timers Gato Barbieri, Bobby Caldwell and Oscar Brown Jr. delivered the 
weakest sets. Most disappointing was Barbieri, whose overtly macho tenor fell 
as flat as a well-worn barroom come-on. 
</P>
<P>
 His rough-hewn attack hasn't changed much in the last 25 years. His familiar, 
gravelly tone was applied to simple lines that built predictably into screams 
and caterwauls, broken only by simple trills and his own vocal exclamations. 
There was little subtlety in his play, and his set, coming at the hottest part 
of the afternoon, would have been a total wash had it not been for fine play 
from keyboardist Bill O'Connell and bassist Nielson Matta. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasional arrangement turns -- as when Barbieri's sultry "Granada" ended with 
lines from "What a Difference a Day Makes" -- added spotty interest but did 
little to redeem things. Barbieri toyed with "Brazil," paying little attention 
to the melody while inflicting it with his trademark raucous gimmicks. 
</P>
<P>
 The day's hit was third-timer Ramsey Lewis' quartet with its fine blend of 
jazz-funk and straight-ahead standards. Still a satisfying soloist, Lewis built 
improvisations from simple statements into harmonically rich, rhythmically 
enticing lines. He set a funky tone with his own "Apres Vous" before taking a 
more mainstream tack with "People Make the World go Round," "My One and Only 
Love" and a sparkling solo turn, "Body and Soul," that referenced both Art 
Tatum and the stride masters. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime Lewis associate Henry Johnson provided sharp, contrasting solo work 
on guitar, standing out during "Someday My Prince Will Come" and delivering 
tough rhythm work on the funk numbers. Bassist Chuck Webb and drummer Ernie 
Adams were equally astute while second keyboardist Michael Logan created 
orchestral effects with a synthesizer perched on the end of Lewis' grand piano. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis' best-received numbers were, of course, "Wade In the Water" and "In 
Crowd," an encore that found drummer and festival promoter Al Williams sitting 
in on congas. Despite the heat, the crowd took to its feet to groove on the 
soulful presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenor saxophonist Whalum's quartet followed with a strong set that was big on 
humor, drawn from vintage television and movie themes he interspersed 
throughout. Whalum, who plays with the melodic sensibilities of a vocalist, is 
one of the better saxophonists in the jazz-funk genre, with good tone, plenty 
of technique and the smarts to put both to good use. 
</P>
<P>
 He showed a tough, backbeat style on "Out Of Hand," then showed hard-nosed 
post-bop chops during a drums-and-sax-only passage of "Brashear Intuition," a 
tune he wrote for trumpeter Oscar Brashear. The only drawback to Whalum's 
performance was his penchant to cut tunes off abruptly after only a short turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer-composer Caldwell's band seemed out of place with its soft rock and 
ballad presentation. Though such numbers as "My Flame," with Caldwell on 
acoustic guitar, and "What You Won't Do For Love" were crowd-pleasers, the set 
seemed a break between more serious matters. Keyboard player Tollack Olsted 
beefed things up with some ambitious harmonica stylings during "Don't Lead Me 
On." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Oscar Brown Jr. proved better at composing a lyric than 
delivering it, despite fine support from trumpeter Bobby Bryant's combo. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Morrison, working with electric guitar and bass, repeated some tunes 
from last year's set in her confident, Sarah Vaughn-inspired manner. She's one 
local favorite who is worth having every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Poncho Sanchez brought a familiar flavor to the end of the evening, 
working his congas hard during Mongo Santamaria's "Afro-Blue" just as he had 
the year before. Still, the Sanchez octet is the most pleasing Latin unit in 
Southern California, and among the best in the country, and its work here, as 
always, was tightly rhythmic and spiced with assertive solos from the horn 
section. 
</P>
<P>
 Dianne Reeves is another perennial Long Beach favorite and for good reason. 
Her golden-toned delivery and the autobiographical details she brings to a 
lyric are completely absorbing. Though her range Friday seemed slightly 
diminished from past performances, her energy did not as she spun stories of 
her childhood and her grandmother to a rapt audience. 
</P>
<P>
 An overly stylistic vocal delivery would cloud Reeves' narrative approach. 
Thankfully, she sings without overwrought embellishment; her clear enunciation 
guarantees that every word registers. 
</P>
<P>
 Keyboard player Keiko Matsui followed her usual format, playing a number of 
impressionistic, New Age-style pieces before strapping on a shoulder-hung 
keyboard to rock. Husband Kazu Matsui added breath-filled, moody touches with 
the shakuhachi flute during "Walls of the Cave," a piece dedicated to Native 
American Chief Joseph, but the net result of the set was the feeling that we'd 
heard it all before. 
</P>
<P>
 Guitarist Norman Brown, reviewed here earlier this summer at the Taste of 
Orange County festival, succeeded best with covers: Stevie Wonder's "Too High," 
Janet Jackson's "That's the Way Love Goes" and Marvin Gaye's "What's Going On?" 
Though a promising guitarist, Brown continues to look too much toward George 
Benson for inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival continued Sunday with George Howard, Joe Williams, David Benoit, 
Tania Maria and others scheduled to appear.

 Clearly No. 1: What better place to spend the hottest days of the summer than 
an air-conditioned movie theater? Despite the lack of any major new summer 
release, moviegoers turned out in force during the weekend and the nation's box 
office did strong business for what is typically a somewhat sluggish period. 
"Clear and Present Danger" was in the No. 1 spot for the second weekend in a 
row. The Paramount film starring Harrison Ford grossed $15.7 million, according 
to early industry estimates. Paramount's "Forrest Gump" held its own with $14 
million for second place -- the movie has grossed about $188 million to date. 
New Line's "The Mask" was third with $10 million. In fourth: Universal's 
"Little Rascals" with $7.2 million. And in fifth: 20th Century Fox's "True 
Lies" with $6.9 million.

novel. Streep will play Francesca, the Iowa woman whose life is changed by an 
affair with a visiting photojournalist, played by Clint Eastwood. Eastwood will 
also direct the film. Steven Spielberg is an executive producer of the movie, 
which is set to begin production in Winterset, Iowa, in mid-September. ART The 
Getty Gets Angry: The J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu has issued an angry 
response to the latest setback in its five-year effort to buy Antonio Canova's 
neoclassical sculpture "The Three Graces" for about $11.8 million and import it 
from Britain. London's Victoria and Albert Museum -- which has led a 
fund-raising campaign to match the Getty's price and buy the sculpture for its 
own collection -- on Friday announced that it had received a pledge of about 
$1.55 million from John Paul Getty II, the London-based son of the late oil 
barron. The pledge leaves a balance of about $1.24 million to be raised by Nov. 
5. The surprise donation came on the heels of a British government decision to 
defer the Getty Museum's export license to Nov. 5. "Our efforts to acquire the 
statue . . . have been frustrated by deliberate manipulations of the system," 
Getty Museum Director John Walsh said in a statement released to the press. 
"This continuing sorry saga does not enhance the standing of Britain, and 
London in particular, in the international art market." John Paul Getty II's 
pledge is only the second in the fund-raising appeal to come from a private 
source, the press release noted. Most of the funds raised for the sculpture -- 
which the British government refused to buy for $1.86 million, when it first 
came on the market in 1983 -- have come from tax-supported museums. TELEVISION 
Grammer Back on Set: "Frasier" star Kelsey Grammer called in sick last week, 
possibly with a case of David Caruso's ("NYPD Blue") blue flu. The New York 
Post reported Saturday that Grammer showed up at work unexpectedly late Friday 
after staying away three days in a pay dispute with producers of his hit 
"Cheers" spinoff. "Frasier" is set to go into production for its second season 
Wednesday. The Post said Grammer probably earned about $70,000 per episode last 
year.

 'Geraldo' Suit: A self-proclaimed former Mafia kingpin who claims Geraldo 
Rivera lured him onto his talk show and then humiliated him with false 
accusations, has sued the talk-show host in Los Angeles for $20 million, 
alleging fraud and deceit. Sonny Gibson says he was accused of sexual 
harassment and rape by "paid shills" who appeared in disguise and under false 
identities at Geraldo's May 3 show on "Women Who Married Men in the Mafia." 
Representatives from the show could not be reached for comment. STAGE 'Beauty' 
Comes to L.A.: The national tour of Disney's new stage version of "Beauty and 
the Beast" will appear in Los Angeles, with March 8 targeted as opening night, 
according to producer Robert McTyre. The Pantages and the Shubert theaters are 
the leading contenders in ongoing negotiations for the show, which will run "we 
hope for a long time," McTyre said. No casting decisions have been made, so 
it's not known whether some of the Broadway cast might move west. MUSIC The 
Paris Opera Aftermath: The troubled Paris Opera said it would divide 
performances among several conductors after firing its music director, 
Myung-Whun Chung, just a few weeks from the season opening. The management 
contracted with three conductors for the main scheduled performances and said 
it would announce later who would take over the remaining concerts. The South 
Korean-born, U.S.-trained Chung, 41, was fired in a dispute over money and 
artistic freedom. He was to have started rehearsals today for Verdi's "Simon 
Boccanegra," which will open the season on Friday. Simone Young, a regular 
performer in Vienna, Berlin and London, will take over "Simon Boccanegra." 
Maurizio Benini of Milan's La Scala will conduct Puccini's "Madame Butterfly," 
and Alain Lombard, head of the Bordeaux orchestra, would perform Berlioz's "The 
Damning of Faust." QUICK TAKE Garrison Keillor, Red Skelton and "The Burns and 
Allen Show" are among the latest inductees into the Radio Hall of Fame, which 
is located at the Museum of Broadcast Communications in Chicago. They'll be 
honored during a broadcast, hosted by Charles Osgood, set to air on various 
radio stations across the country Nov. 6. BETH KLEID

MUSIC REVIEW; MOZART CARRIES THE DAY IN IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One can get tired of Tchaikovsky. Ditto Rachmaninoff. One even can conceivably 
get too much of -- gasp! -- Beethoven. Mozart, perhaps alone, never wears. 
You'll never hear a critic, or anyone else for that matter, say "Oh no! Not the 
'Prague' again." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is what saved the Pacific Symphony Saturday night. Its Mozart program at 
Irvine Meadows was neither well-rehearsed nor particularly well-executed. The 
amplification was primitive. The air was close, the orchestra opting for shirt 
sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mozart reigned and overcame, and sent at least one listener among the 
7,541 in attendance home happy. The guest conductor on this occasion was Klaus 
Donath, a 57-year-old German with proper credentials for these proceedings, 
including time spent as assistant to that eminent Mozartean Karl Bohm. In 
recent seasons and locally, Donath has led two Mozart operas for Opera Pacific 
and is scheduled for a third. 
</P>
<P>
 As befitting an opera conductor, he revealed a keen eye for drama in the music 
at hand. This was not homogenized Mozart, or drawing-room Mozart, or cool and 
calculated Mozart, but vital, robust, bubbly Mozart. The performances went 
somewhere. And though the playing proved rough a good deal of the time, it was 
never dull. 
</P>
<P>
 Two symphonies framed the agenda, the overture-like No. 32 in a bracing 
run-through to open the concert, and the beloved No. 38, "Prague." Donath's 
brisk tempos in the latter often found the Pacific players scrambling, yet the 
pulse never seemed labored, or pushed. Lightness and buoyancy prevailed. In 
addition, the conductor enforced attention to dynamics and articulation, shaped 
phrases crisply and discovered dramatic emphases. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed a mistake, however, to include the Divertimento in F, K. 138, on 
this program, played by a full contingent of strings. The title "Divertimento" 
not being Mozart's own, the work is fairly obviously chamber music -- i.e., a 
lightweight string quartet in Stanley Sadie's analysis -- and the parts turned 
out unwieldy when played en masse. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, as elsewhere, the Meadows amplification sounded clear but also harsh and 
treble-heavy. The violins were especially piercing. One longed for Mozart 
unplugged. 
</P>
<P>
 In the middle of the program, Anne-Marie McDermott played the Piano Concerto 
in C, K. 467. She showed herself a clean technician and deft stylist, taking 
advantage of the heavy miking to float intimate points in the Andante, never 
settling for mere speed in the outer Allegros, crafting, jabbing and melding 
pertinently detailed lines. Donath and orchestra added a sprightly 
accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
 McDermott's one miscue was her choice of cadenzas. Written by the 19th-Century 
Danish composer August Winding, they seemed better suited to Liszt than to 
Mozart. They were showy and they jarred.

MUSIC REVIEWS; HINDS WARMLY RECEIVED AT GETTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Veteran mezzo-soprano Ruby Hinds was the principal, with pointed assistance 
from violinist Lyndon Taylor and pianists Gloria Cheng and Robert Winter, on a 
program entitled, "The Dawn of Modernism" at the Getty Museum Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth of five summer concerts at the Malibu space, this event, like those 
that preceded it, seemed to be one of the better-kept secrets of this outdoor 
music season -- the concerts are given in the Inner Peristyle Garden at the 
museum.Still, a large and enthusiastic audience, so enthusiastic it applauded 
in all the wrong places, attended. Available seating there was, but parking was 
in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
 Hinds, a handsome woman gowned on this occasion in elegant Chinese red, 
provided the core performances, music written between 1889 and 1911, a period 
which, according to Cheng's informative program notes, was stylistically as 
many-headed as our own. 
</P>
<P>
 The mezzo-soprano's singing of pieces by Wolf and Chabrier, Zemlinsky and 
Mahler, may not have been textually probing -- too many words emerged clouded 
for intelligibility -- but it was delivered with warm tone, musical 
directionalism and a clear sense of mood. 
</P>
<P>
 Best perhaps was her performance of Mahler's familiar "Lieder eines fahrenden 
Gesellen," which closed the program proper. She also excelled at three 
virtually forgotten chansons by Chabrier and delivered the changing moods in 
turn-of-the century songs by Alexander Zemlinsky. In all these, and in Mahler, 
too, Cheng was her sensitive collaborator. 
</P>
<P>
 In between, violinist Taylor revived charming virtuoso pieces by Sinding and 
Rudi Stephan (1887-1915) with abundant skill and ease, and Cheng and Winter 
traversed the fascinations of Erik Satie's historic, four-handed "Trois 
Morceaux en forme de poire" (1903).DANIEL CARIAGA

O.C. ENTERPRISE: GETTING A BIG CHARGE FROM CAPACITORS; MANUFACTURING: OWNER OF 
CERAMIC ELECTRONICS PLANT HAS STRATEGY OF MAKING MORE EFFICIENT UNITS, CHARGING 
MORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS KERBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Casey Crandall measures success by the ten-thousandth of an inch. It's just 
such razor-thin tolerances in his products that have attracted a substantial 
increase in orders this year for his ceramic electronics company. 
</P>
<P>
 Even differences of a tiny fraction of an inch can dramatically alter how well 
a fingertip-sized ceramic part stores an electrical charge. As owner of Wright 
Capacitors Inc. in Santa Ana, Crandall has developed a following of customers 
who need precision within those tiny tolerances, producing electronic 
components to the extreme specifications required by large electronics, 
aerospace and defense companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other (ceramics) companies will roll their parts out by the millions and 
charge two cents for each," Crandall said. Instead, he focuses on parts that 
sell for an average of $3.50 each. "I thought doing fewer pieces and charging 
more was the way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 This year that strategy is paying off. After averaging slightly more than $1 
million in revenue in recent years, Crandall said he expects to do about $1.6 
million in business this year. 
</P>
<P>
 With 20 skilled workers and a customer base built mainly on reputation, 
Crandall's company is an ideal example of a successful small-to-medium size 
manufacturer in Orange County, according to local industry observers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a prime area for research and development and design, but we're (only) 
an OK area for manufacturing, from a cost standpoint," said Philip Beaudoin, 
regional director of the area council of the American Electronics Assn., a 
trade group in which Crandall is active. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than compete on volume or on price, many smaller manufacturers in this 
region focus on continually raising the quality of their products, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that advice is nothing new for many businesses. Crandall said his 
company is only beginning to see the payoff from product development efforts 
made during the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a long curve, especially where you have to keep updating your product," 
Crandall said. Without protection such as patents, product improvements are 
crucial for distinguishing a business. Crandall said he doesn't seek patents on 
his chemical compounds, because he thinks his competitors would learn too much 
from the application alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen my own designs turn up" in others' products, he said. "There's only 
so much you can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Crandall's capacitors begin as large cans of grayish muck, called slurry, in a 
back room of his company, in several adjacent suites at an office plaza near 
the Costa Mesa Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the slurry -- a mixture of ceramic powders, mainly barium titanate -- is 
cast and dried into thin, wide strips, workers print electrodes made from 
precious metals onto the ceramic. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheets are then stacked on top of each other to build up the capacitors, 
which range in size from bits the size of ground pepper to blocks the size of a 
big toe. The spaces created between the electrodes by the precise ceramic 
layers give the capacitors their specific storage ability. 
</P>
<P>
 After several rounds of baking, small wires are soldered onto the ends of the 
capacitors, readying them to carry the electrical charges used by more active 
electronic parts -- such as computer chips -- for high-speed processing tasks. 
The more efficient the capacitors, the faster the chips can run. 
</P>
<P>
 Capacitors were formerly made of less-efficient materials, such as paper or 
aluminum, but ceramics have taken over about 80% of the market in the last 
decade, according to Mark Rosenker, a spokesman for the Electronic Industries 
Assn. in Washington. Total sales of capacitors boomed to $1.7 billion in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The more efficient ceramic capacitors are among the advances that have allowed 
more compact consumer goods, such as palm-sized cellular phones and laptop 
computers. But they are also more difficult to build, and larger manufacturers 
often won't bother with orders of less than tens of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Colangelo, an engineer at Texas Instruments in Dallas who often buys 
capacitors from Crandall, said he appreciates the owner-engineer's flexibility 
in working on smaller quantities. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a bigger company, you may work with a couple of engineers, but they don't 
have the flexibility," Colangelo said. "With Casey, he can do any damn thing he 
wants. . . . He can do the smaller batches" that companies like Texas 
Instruments need for its prototypes, Colangelo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crandall, 41, earned a master's degree in ceramic engineering at UCLA and was 
working toward his doctorate there when he decided to switch to a business 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was going to be a professor," he said. "But some of my professors 
were telling me that I worked well with people, and I started thinking about 
what else I might do instead." In 1978 he joined San Fernando Electric 
Manufacturing Co., in northern Los Angeles County, a mass-production capacitors 
company that has since closed. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, the founder of Wright Capacitors, Curtis Wright, encouraged him to 
move to the Santa Ana company with the idea of gradually taking it over. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a difficult decision, Crandall said. "I was a division manager, and I 
felt like I was still learning," he said. And just after he took the new job, a 
glut in the personal-computers industry depressed the capacitor market, putting 
Wright's business into the red. 
</P>
<P>
 As manager, Crandall said, he helped return the company to profitability 
within two years. In 1984 he agreed to buy the company from Wright. That deal 
was completed in 1989, the year Wright died of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last 10 years, the company has been profitable with about 15 employees 
and revenue that "bounced between" $900,000 and $1.2 million, Crandall said. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's anticipated revenue increase to $1.6 million is, in part, a reward 
for survival; several competitors folded during the recession, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had some sleepless nights," Crandall said of the period from 1990 to 1992, 
when sales fell below $1 million for the first time in a decade and he had to 
lay off three employees. He was also forced to make his employees work during 
some scheduled vacation days to get through that period, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His site in the Santa Ana Enterprise Zone has also helped, he said. A close 
competitor moved from Orange County to Nevada in 1992, but Crandall said he has 
no plans to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's always raving about how much money he's saved, but I guess it's loyalty 
to the employees that keeps me here," Crandall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Wright Capacitors' employees are trained for various assembly tasks 
and are paid an average hourly wage of $9. The average employee has worked at 
the company for about seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Crandall also recently hired an engineer, whom he hopes will free him to 
devote more time to the marketing and sales side of his operation. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the many sides of his business, all happening at once, that keep 
things interesting, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very satisfying to see a design go out the door, after it started out as 
a customer's sketch," Crandall said. "In a larger industry or a larger company, 
you only get to see one portion of the pie."

OSTIN EXPECTED TO STEP DOWN AS CHAIRMAN OF WARNER UNIT; MUSIC: REVERED RECORD 
EXECUTIVE EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE TODAY THAT HE WILL LEAVE WHEN HIS CONTRACT 
EXPIRES, SOURCES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In what will mark the end of an era, music industry titan Mo Ostin is expected 
to announce today that he will step down as chairman of Warner Bros. Records 
when his contract expires Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Ostin, who has run the Burbank-based label for three lucrative decades, will 
pass the baton to Lenny Waronker, his longtime sidekick and current company 
president, according to sources at Warner Bros. Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives for Ostin and Warner Music Group, the recording unit of 
Time-Warner Inc., could not be reached for comment Sunday. However, members of 
the music industry were startled Sunday by the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mo Ostin is the single finest record executive in the world -- a man with no 
peers in this industry," said entertainment impresario David Geffen, who worked 
with Ostin for almost two decades. "He made that label the most successful on 
the planet. It's impossible to imagine Warner Bros. Records without Mo Ostin 
running it. As his longtime friend, it saddens me to see him leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Ostin's resignation is the latest fallout in a major shake-up at Warner Music 
Group, the world's largest recording organization that is home to such acts as 
Madonna, Metallica and Snoop Doggy Dogg. 
</P>
<P>
 Tensions have been high at Warner Music Group -- which includes Warner Bros. 
Records, Elektra Entertainment and Atlantic -- since a sweeping realignment of 
the Time-Warner music group was announced last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The shake-up was signaled July 11, when Warner Music Group Chairman Robert 
Morgado promoted former Atlantic chief Doug Morris to the top of its new Warner 
Music USA sector, anointing Morris as his No. 2 man in America. Under the 
restructuring plan, Ostin and all U.S. label heads are required to report 
directly to Morris, whose title is chief operating officer of Warner Music USA. 
</P>
<P>
 The move, insiders say, was orchestrated in part to hasten the departure of 
key figures at the conglomerate's other two major music units. Indeed, former 
Elektra Chairman Bob Krasnow resigned the day after the restructuring plan was 
announced, citing his exclusion from the new corporate inner circle. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources have said that Ostin, arguably the most revered executive in the 
recording business, was also unhappy about the new chain of command and clashed 
with Warner top brass on several occasions in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Ostin has been resistant to suggestions that he streamline his 
label and name a successor. Two weeks ago, the New York-based Morris flew to 
Burbank unexpectedly and met behind closed doors with Ostin. Ostin traveled 
back to New York four days later to resolve the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ostin is to leave Warner Bros. Records on Jan. 1, he is expected to 
stay on as a consultant to Time Warner chief Gerald Levin.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ENTERPRISE; GETTING DIVERSITY INTO THE BOARDROOMS; 
EXECUTIVE SEARCH FIRM HELPS CORPORATIONS FIND WOMEN AND MINORITIES TO SERVE AS 
DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a different era in 1985 when a shareholder at an annual meeting asked 
Unocal Chairman Fred L. Hartley how long it would take the Los Angeles oil 
giant to appoint a woman to its board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 The irascible top executive explained "how hard it is to select women who have 
honest-to-goodness business experience," before adding: "I had one lady in mind 
and she died." Hundreds of stockholders shared a good laugh that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, diversity is a very serious issue for corporations that are 
examining the residents of their boardrooms and executive offices with an eye 
toward competing more effectively in a diverse marketplace. (Unocal, by the 
way, added a female director in 1989, but still lacks minorities.) 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, finding women and minorities has become a hot new area of 
business for executive search firms, both large and small. A fledgling company 
with the apt name of Diversity Search Partners is taking a unique approach. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm's multiethnic principals are giving their knowledge away in the form 
of a book of prospective minority and female board candidates -- sort of like a 
dating service for corporations. Their hope is to promote diversity and perhaps 
generate a little executive search action along the way for their 8-month-old 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 "Corporations are realizing this is a business need, not just a good thing to 
do," said Betsy Berkhemer-Credaire, president of Diversity Search Partners, 
which is based in downtown Los Angeles' historic Union Station. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea behind Diversity Search Partners as well as for its corporate board 
candidate portfolio grew out of Berkhemer-Credaire's volunteer service with 
Rebuild L.A. after the 1992 riots. "I met so many remarkable minority 
executives whom I did not know before," said Berkhemer-Credaire, who was 
chairwoman of RLA's public relations and communications committee. "I saw a 
tremendous need." She began seeking partners with the same vision. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, then-RLA chief Peter Ueberroth was dreaming of a book that 
chief executives could use to go beyond the usual circles when seeking 
candidates for director positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Ueberroth persuaded Diversity Search Partners to donate time and contacts to 
find the 73 candidates in the portfolio. He wrote a cover letter and provided a 
mailing list of top executives of large companies, who began receiving the book 
in July. Lincy Foundation helped pay for printing costs with a donation made 
through RLA. 
</P>
<P>
 The book lists blacks, Latinos and Asians who are qualified to serve on boards 
of corporations or nonprofit organizations. Some already do. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main criterion was outstanding business careers," Berkhemer-Credaire 
said. "We looked for experience that would be a complement or an advantage to a 
corporate board." 
</P>
<P>
 Included are such well-known names as former Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, 
Los Angeles Urban League President John W. Mack, Vons Cos. President Emeritus 
William S. Davila, and lawyer Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., whose clients have 
included Michael Jackson and O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 But most are less recognized, the type of men and women whom large 
corporations seldom consider when looking to fill a board position, said Fred 
J. Clayton, a partner in Diversity Search Partners with a long history in 
executive search and human resource consulting positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ended up talking to more people than we anticipated and ended up including 
more people than we had anticipated ," Clayton said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the book, which the partners have hopefully labeled "Volume One," is not 
all-inclusive, Clayton added. No names of Native Americans or disabled people 
made the list, simply because Diversity Search Partners did not come across any 
this time, he said. The book also emphasized people from the West. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were not doing the definitive study," Berkhemer-Credaire said. "We did not 
analyze every potential candidate in the country and select 73." 
</P>
<P>
 The book also will help promote Diversity Search Partners to future clients in 
need of minority and female directors and executives, said Peter Garrett, 
publisher of Directorship newsletter, a monthly publication on corporate 
governance issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the effort to be a focal point for qualified people is a proactive 
move that will serve them well," Garrett said. "For my money, based on what we 
hear from corporate secretaries, there is high interest at least in Fortune 500 
companies in locating a new -- and I would underline new -- group of qualified 
minorities and women to be considered for board service." 
</P>
<P>
 Currently about 4% of board seats are held by minorities, Garrett said. But 
the same names appear again and again as a relatively small group of candidates 
gets the corporate "stamp of approval," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 O.J. Simpson, for example, was on four corporate boards before his arrest on 
suspicion of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, for corporate boards, it's that name I.D.," said Melba T. Sanders, 
a member of Diversity Search Partners who previously owned an "executive image" 
consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Added partner Geri Sacasa: "The myth that many of our corporate clients have 
come to believe is that there is a limited number of qualified candidates 
available (for director and senior executive positions), and we know that's not 
true." 
</P>
<P>
 "People are able to open this document and read about people with achievements 
that equal their own, if not surpass them," said Sacasa, who folded her own 
executive search firm specializing in minorities and women into Diversity 
Search Partners. Beyond the corporate board portfolio, Diversity Search 
Partners concentrates on finding "balanced" groups of candidates for executive 
positions that pay $75,000 or more. The company has conducted searches for 
firms such as Walt Disney Co., Anheuser-Busch Inc., Nestle and Bank of America. 
Diversity Search also helps clients find minority suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a tremendous amount of pressure on corporations to diversify their 
boards" and executive positions coming from consumers, employees and 
shareholders, said partner Bill Imada, who has a human relations background and 
owns a separate marketing firm called Imada Wong Communications, which 
specializes in the Asian marketplace.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: WALL STREET SEARCHING FOR A WAY OUT OF TRADING RANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The stock market is looking for a leader to bring it out of the desert. 
</P>
<P>
 That desert is the trading range in which the major market indexes have been 
stuck since winter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average, for example, has mostly just bounced around 
between 3,600 and 3,800 since March 31. The Dow closed at 3,768.71 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street has been waiting for a new or recycled investment theme to emerge, 
one powerful enough to overcome interest-rate concerns and pull the Dow and 
other indexes up to new highs. 
</P>
<P>
 But so far, although individual industry sectors have rallied periodically, 
few of those rallies have had much staying power. Hence the Dow and the 
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index have meandered in a narrow corridor, with 
price moves limited to a 4% to 6% band since late March. 
</P>
<P>
 For big and small investors alike, this period has been grating. Few market 
players are losing enough to feel as if they're in a bona fide bear market, but 
neither are they winning enough to feel as if the bull market is still kicking. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my 25 years in the business, I've never seen money managers so frustrated" 
with the market, says Edward Nicoski, technical analyst at brokerage Piper 
Jaffray in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it may just be that a large number of the money managers working 
today have nothing with which to compare this experience. Since the mid-1980s, 
after all, they've mostly known only two kinds of markets: Either stocks have 
been rising steadily (1985-'87, 1988-'89, 1991-'93) or crashing (late 1987, 
summer 1990). 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the market has shaken off much of the gloom that slammed it early 
on, when the Federal Reserve Board began to tighten credit in February. The S&P 
500 index now is down just 1% year-to-date, and it has certainly been possible 
to make substantial money trading moves in individual stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 What's lacking, however, is sustained leadership among key industry stock 
groups -- the kind of powerful share-price momentum that gets investors excited 
and pulls them aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Nicoski notes that many heavy-industry stocks are trading at or 
near their 1994 highs, as some investors continue to bet on a strong economy. 
Most steel and chemical shares, in particular, have rallied briskly this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 But the industrial rally hasn't included some of the group's bellwether 
issues, such as machinery titan Caterpillar, which at $105.125 Friday is off 
13% from its 1994 peak of $121.50; or steel giant USX-U.S. Steel, which at 
$39.50 Friday still is down 9% from its year-end price. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Big Three auto shares -- whose fortunes many investors might 
most closely associate with economic good times -- are mired in their own 
private bear market. GM stock, now $50.125, is down 23% from its 1994 peak. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in recent weeks, tentative signs of leadership have appeared in several 
stock sectors, giving hope to Wall Street bulls that a major market move is 
afoot: 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks have roared back from their spring selloff, as bargain 
hunters have snapped up hardware and software issues that had dropped 40% or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple Computer, for instance, has zoomed from a spring low of $24.625 to 
$34.75 now, and is closing in on its 1994 high of $38.50. Semiconductor 
powerhouse Texas Instruments, which tumbled from $89 to $61 in the first half 
of the year, is back to $82. 
</P>
<P>
 * Health-care stocks, including big drug companies, have been re-energized by 
takeover fever and by investors' perception that President Clinton's 
health-care reform proposals are in serious trouble on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner-Lambert, one of the premier drug firms, hit a new 1994 high of $77.875 
Friday, and has rallied up from $60 in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. packaged food stocks came back to life last week, as rumors resurfaced 
that foreign food companies are on the acquisition trail. Shares of H.J. Heinz, 
Kellogg, Hershey Foods and CPC International all jumped 3% to 3.5% on Friday 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 But can these stock groups gain enough momentum to give the market a 
meaningful lift? Lehman Bros. veteran analyst Elaine Garzarelli thinks so. 
Though she still sees the Dow in a trading range in the near term, she believes 
the top of that range should expand to 4,200 from the current 3,800. 
</P>
<P>
 A 4,200 Dow would be an 11% rise from Friday's close. 
</P>
<P>
 Garzarelli sees the economy slowing as the Federal Reserve continues to raise 
short-term interest rates (another Fed hike is expected this week). 
</P>
<P>
 While slower growth could hurt some industrial stocks, Garzarelli expects 
drug, food, beverage and other classic consumer stocks to continue returning to 
favor as investors hunt for more stable (i.e., less cyclical) earnings growth. 
Those consumer-stock groups will be the new leaders, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Other analysts, though pleased with the recent pickup of buying in certain 
stock sectors, aren't willing to bet that most of the new market leaders will 
enjoy a long reign. 
</P>
<P>
 David Holt, technical analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles, 
thinks the strength in IBM shares and other technology issues since mid-July 
bodes well for that group. 
</P>
<P>
 But the problem for the market as a whole is that investors perceive most 
stocks to be fairly priced now relative to earnings expectations and interest 
rates, Holt says. "I think there's very little overvaluation or undervaluation 
in this market," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although fair valuation sounds comfortable, it results in a churning market, 
Holt says: Institutional investors run from stock to stock, herding in when 
they collectively sense undervaluation, and quickly selling once a stock smells 
even faintly of overvaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors "keep turning over rocks to find new (ideas)," Holt says, but they 
don't keep what they find for very long. "It's producing a very fractured, 
disjointed market." 
</P>
<P>
 Piper Jaffray's Nicoski argues that investors who are waiting for new stock 
leaders to signal a return of the bull market will be sorely disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the market of the late 1970s, this one could continue to churn for a long 
time, tugged by rising interest rates on one side and higher corporate profits 
on the other, Nicoski says. 
</P>
<P>
 In previous such periods, he says, "to try to be bullish or bearish was not 
the proper approach." Instead, the successful investor targeted individual 
stocks, waited patiently for them to fall into bargain-price range, then bought 
aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
 "You probably ought not to label this market anything, but just learn to take 
advantage of selloffs in quality stocks," Nicoski says. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 More California Bonds: Less than a month after borrowing $7 billion via 
short-term notes, the state of California will raise another $700 million this 
Wednesday in a general-obligation bond offering. 
</P>
<P>
 The bonds, part of the voter-approved backlog for new schools, prisons and 
other facilities, will be issued in maturities ranging from one to 30 years. 
Half the $700 million will be sold in one- to 10-year maturities. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street municipal bond analysts were mixed Friday in assessing potential 
demand. Some worry that individual investors, who typically are heavy buyers of 
shorter-term maturities at state bond offerings, got their fill in the July 
sale of $7 billion in 11-month and 21-month securities. 
</P>
<P>
 That record borrowing was necessitated by the state's ongoing cash crunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way (individuals) will be able to absorb" the new bonds so soon 
after July's offering, one muni bond trader said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, said many individuals who tried to buy the short-term notes 
in July were shut out by strong demand from institutional investors, and thus 
could still be hungry for tax-free yields. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said Friday that they expect the three-year portion of Wednesday's 
offering to yield 4.75% to 4.85% annualized. Five-year bonds in the offering 
could yield 5.10% to 5.30%, and the 10-year issue 5.60% to 5.70%. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 34.7% combined federal and state tax bracket in California (taxable 
income of $61,241 to $91,850 for a couple), a tax-free yield of 4.75% would be 
worth 7.27% on a taxed investment such as a bank CD. A 5.60% tax-free yield 
would be worth 8.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 The bonds can be purchased through brokerages and at major banks' investment 
desks, usually in minimum lots of $20,000 to $25,000.

DESIGNERS IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT; INNOVATIVE SOUTHLAND FIRMS ARE HAVING A 
PROFOUND INFLUENCE ON THE SHAPE OF THE AUTO'S FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER and KAREN KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charles W. O. Ellwood, an English-born car designer who has spent most of his 
career in Germany, had an epiphany of sorts when he arrived in Southern 
California last October to take the helm of Volkswagen's design studio in Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The American motorist's fascination with cup holders, he says, suddenly made 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't drive the speeds we drive in Europe and use cup holders; it's just 
too dangerous," says Ellwood, 39, former chief of interior design at Volkswagen 
in Wolfsburg, Germany. "But here, you're living in the vehicle, you're drinking 
in the vehicle, the kids are moving back and forth. You're doing a lot of 
things other than driving." 
</P>
<P>
 Car makers have been coming to similar realizations since they began flocking 
to the West Coast 20 years ago. From cup holders built into dashboards to the 
sleek coupes seen pulling out of driveways, the Southern California influence 
has been profound. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most auto designs are still produced in Detroit, Tokyo, Wolfsburg and 
other motor cities, "probably the best designs in the world are coming out of 
California" because the environment is conducive to creativity, says Jess 
Harder, chief designer at International Automotive Design in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Miata two-seat ragtop was born in Mazda's design studio in Irvine. Toyota 
designers in Newport Beach created the Previa minivan and the Lexus SC 300 and 
400 models. Southern California studios also produced the 1993 Ford Probe and 
Chevrolet's 1994 Camaro, models that revived sports coupe sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, 16 satellite studios and a handful of independent automotive design 
firms throughout the region are shaping the futures of General Motors, Ford, 
Volvo, BMW and Volkswagen, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the expertise in seat design of Designworks/USA in Newbury Park that 
caught the attention of BMW in the late 1980s, says Charles W. Pelly, president 
of Designworks. The German auto maker has since purchased 60% of Designworks' 
stock, and now accounts for a third of the studio's business. 
</P>
<P>
 Volkswagen's updated version of the classic Beetle, promised for delivery to 
dealers in 1998, was designed in Simi Valley. The company is hoping the new 
Beetle will catch the fancy of 21st Century drivers as the original did in the 
20th. 
</P>
<P>
 Designers for other car makers are also under the gun to divine the whims of 
the next century. The stakes are monumental. To take a design from sketches to 
cars on the road can take more than five years and cost $1 billion or more. And 
American and European car makers, since losing market share to Japanese 
competitors in the 1980s, know they cannot afford to neglect a single nuance of 
design. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas V. Peters, head of GM's studio in Newbury Park, says flatly: "This is 
war." 
</P>
<P>
 California, then, is a strategic battlefront. The state accounts for 10% of 
new car registrations in the United States each year and 3% of new 
registrations worldwide. To succeed in California, car makers have decided, it 
makes sense to be in California, where the sunshine shows off a car's finish 
and reveals the flaws or grace of every curve, where car-crazy consumers are 
quick to embrace a fresh design and quicker to discard a stale one, and where 
trends seem to land like drops of water and ripple over the rest of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Designers at local studios work in high-tech security buildings to guard 
against industrial spying. "Paranoia runs rampant," said Ronald Powers, 
president of Powers Design International, an independent design firm in Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Designers furtively scour the Southern California landscape for hints of 
shifting consumer tastes, looking for clues in everything from computer 
terminals to electric mixers to athletic shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our influences range from man-made to nature, American to international," 
says Douglas Halbert, chief designer at Honda Research and Development in 
Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have adopted an academic approach. Volvo's Camarillo design center, for 
example, employs a staff sociologist to track changes in consumer attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a think tank," says Sylvia S. Voegele, general manager at Volvo's 
studio. "When we present a design, we also present who we think it would sell 
to and why." 
</P>
<P>
 Designers say that working in Southern California gives them a dual 
competitive edge. Living amid the highest concentration of car enthusiasts in 
the world allows them to sense taste trends and driving amid the world's 
largest variety of cars provides constant style inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 When Tom Matano oversaw the design of the Miata, he pictured himself driving 
the car on Pacific Coast Highway from Laguna Beach up to Malibu. The RX7, also 
designed in Mazda's California studios, was envisioned as a model that athletic 
types would drive to the gym for workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Designers in New York and Tokyo -- who take the train to work -- would not 
have designed the kinds of cars that are popular in California, Matano says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of being a designer is being a visionary," says Dave Hackett, general 
manager of Toyota's Newport Beach design studio, which is the oldest of the 
Southern California studios. "Based on what we see today, we have to predict 
what people will want three to five years from now." 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, the manufacturer will specify wheelbase and engine layout, then 
request a new design or an updating of a model already in production. As soon 
as the order arrives the designers commence sketching, and the weeding-out 
process begins. The designers compete with each other; studios compete with 
other studios within the company and with independent design studios. And, 
finally, the car makers compete in the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford's studio in Valencia has fared well in these contests. Hastily assembled 
in 1983 after GM had laid plans for its Newbury Park facility, the Ford studio 
produced a winner right away -- the 1989 edition Thunderbird. Since then, the 
studio has had a string of successes, including major influence on the 1993 
Probe. Sales of that sports coupe surged 42% from 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, even Hutting acknowledges that Ford, the domestic design leader since 
it introduced the top-selling Taurus sedan in the mid-1980s, has surrendered 
the mantle to Chrysler, whose striking new line was developed at the Chrysler 
Pacifica studio in Carlsbad. Ford, Hutting says, must find ways to reassert 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the key challenges will be to anticipate trends in the minivan and 
sport utility vehicle markets, segments that barely existed a decade ago but 
last year accounted for 16% of Ford's domestic sales (564,916 units). 
</P>
<P>
 Searching for clues to the future of these markets, Hutting and his design 
team are paying close attention to societal trends, such as the four-day work 
week. If that trend broadens, consumers may use vehicles less for commuting and 
more for leisure-time driving. 
</P>
<P>
 While Ford was turning heads with the Taurus, GM was turning stomachs with the 
Caprice, a whale of a car that went belly up on arrival. GM lost U.S. market 
share in the last decade but has had better luck with the 1994 Chevrolet 
Camaro, based largely on an aerodynamic Newbury Park design. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. sales of the Camaro and its Pontiac Firebird sibling totaled 76,602 
during the first five months of 1994, compared to 21,509 cars of the previous 
design during the equivalent period of 1993. "GM finally gets it," says Gordon 
Wangers, an analyst with Vista-based Automotive Marketing Consultants Inc. "The 
Camaro could be a car that will turn GM around." 
</P>
<P>
 Volkswagen has pinned similar hopes on the Concept One, the working name for a 
smooth, symmetrical successor to the Beetle. 
</P>
<P>
 U. S. Beetle sales peaked at 367,607 in 1969, but Volkswagen sales have fallen 
off the charts since 1977, when the last Beetle was sold in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Volkswagen spokeswoman Lana Ferrari says that since January, when the Concept 
One was unveiled at the Detroit auto show, the company has fielded 30,000 calls 
and collected 5,000 letters from VW fans urging the company to build the new 
Beetle. 
</P>
<P>
 For all its nostalgic appeal, the Concept One is no replica, says Ellwood, 
head of Volkswagen's Simi Valley studio. The car is capable of running on 
electricity -- an important capacity since California law requires that 2% of 
all vehicles sold in the state in 1998 be emissions-free. Unlike its 
predecessor, the Concept One has a front engine, front-wheel drive, anti-lock 
brakes, dual air bags and, of course, "cup holders front and rear," Ellwood 
says with a chuckle. "We paid particular attention to that."

 For those who are longing for statistics now that the baseball strike is on, 
consider this: A substantial number of players make in a single hour what a 
fair number of people make in a single week. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Bobby Bonilla of the Mets, who makes $719 each hour, 24 hours a day, 
365 days a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Others include: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Orioles' Cal Riplen Jr: $646. 
</P>
<P>
 * Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr: $570. 
</P>
<P>
 * San Francisco's Barry Bonds: $589. 
</P>
<P>
 On the lower end are the Dodgers and Angels.

 Pitcher Tom Candiotti makes $417 an hour, and Angels pitcher Chuck Finley 
checks in at $442. Growth Formula

 A lot of people invest and wind up taking a haircut when it doesn't work out. 
</P>
<P>
 One who apparently doesn't is Sy Sperling, the hair-weave baron made famous by 
commercials for the Hair Club for Men that he heads. 
</P>
<P>
 In the August issue of SmartMoney magazine, Sperling discloses that he has 
weaved a successful investment portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 He once made a quick $10,000 killing in a few days on TWA stock. 
</P>
<P>
 A "Rugs to Riches" chart of his current holdings shows he owns 
telecommunications firm Tellabs, Hong Kong electrical company China Light and 
Power and software maker Oracle Systems.

 Absent from Sperling's holdings is Upjohn, maker of the Rogaine hair-growing 
drug. Missing the Mark 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica-based "Future News Index" had predicted the comet fragments 
crashing into Jupiter last month might well have a major impact on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it says the event was offset by such factors as the attention given the 
25th anniversary of man's landing on the moon and by congressional testimony 
given by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Two Birds of a Feather 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Turner has a new nickname for media baron Rupert Murdoch: "Wild Man 
Rupert." 
</P>
<P>
 In a talk to reporters at the recent Goodwill Games, Turner made news when he 
openly said he'd like to buy any of the major networks. Then Turner added: "One 
of the three networks is going to take advantage of going into business with us 
in order to compete with wild man Rupert." 
</P>
<P>
 Turner went on to recall that he once said in an interview that he would 
eventually win out over Murdoch because actuarial tables showed he would live 
10 years longer. 
</P>

 Auto Safety Hearing: The U.S. Dept. of Transportation will hold a town meeting 
in San Diego on Thursday on proposals to to require car makers to give 
consumers additional safety information on tires, crash worthiness, child 
safety, roll-over propensity and other areas.Roll-over propensity is a topic of 
much interest to some consumer groups and insurers who want car makers to 
adhere to stricter road stability standards. More than 9,000 passengers are 
killed annually as a result of vehicle roll-overs, a third of all vehicle 
occupant deaths. Nine out of 10 roll-over accidents involve a single vehicle. 
The meeting is one of four that the DOT's National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration is conducting nationwide.

 Earthquake Loan Workshops: The first in a new series of workshops designed to 
help businesses apply for earthquake related loans from the Small Business 
Administration will be held Wednesday in Van Nuys. Seven more in the series, 
sponsored by the Valley Economic Development Center, the city of Los Angeles, 
the state, the SBA, the Small Business Development Center and the Los Angeles 
Times, will take place in the San Fernando Valley through Sept. 7.The 
workshops, similar to those hosted by the VEDC immediately after the January 
temblor, is targeted for earthquake-impacted businesses that have not yet 
submitted a loan application to the SBA or have been turned down for an SBA 
loan. Topics to be discussed include how to appeal a loan denial or reapply for 
a loan, relocation assistance and how to obtain bridge loans. One-on-one 
counseling is also available. Reservations for the workshops are required, and 
can be made by calling (818)989-4377.

 Avalon Resort Vote: The Avalon City Council is scheduled to vote Tuesday on a 
development agreement for a 300-room luxury resort hotel on Descanso Beach that 
would enable a Phoenix-based builder to secure financing for the project. The 
city has already approved the plan for the $100 million resort, which would 
feature restaurants and meeting rooms said Avalon City Manager Robert Clark.The 
resort is designed to attract visitors year-round, especially for conventions. 
It is projected to net $25.9 million a year in revenue by its third year of 
operation, said Rick Williams of The Pointe Group, the Phoenix company that has 
already built about two dozen resorts and hotels in the western United States. 
Clark said the resort "would be a huge benefit to the city, both in terms of 
our tax base and in terms of generating business for the rest of the town," 
which is currently served by much smaller hotels.

 Home Construction Report: The Commerce Department will release its report on 
July construction activity on Tuesday, and local home builders will be paying 
close attention.Rising interest rates have pushed housing starts across the 
U.S. lower for three straight months, and another decline could shatter 
developers' hopes for a late-summer rebound. Some Southern California builders 
-- including Los Angeles-based Kaufman & Broad Home Corp., the state's largest 
-- have already slashed their sales projections for the year. But what's bad 
news for builders could be good news for buyers: The recent sales slowdown is 
forcing prices down at many housing tracts, which takes some of the sting out 
of rising interest rates.

CRACKS FOUND IN WINGS OF 7 CONCORDES, AIRLINE SAYS; AEROSPACE: BRITISH AIRWAYS 
SAYS THE PROBLEM POSES NO SAFETY THREAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 British Airways said Sunday that it has found hairline cracks inside the wings 
of its seven supersonic Concorde aircraft but that there is no safety threat 
and that the planes would stay in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not an airworthiness issue . . . there's absolutely no implication for 
the safe operation of Concorde," an airline spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, investigators revealed that in April, a British Airways Concorde 
with 55 people aboard had come close to losing pressure in the cabin when two 
outer cabin window panels shattered. 
</P>
<P>
 The spokeswoman said that two of the seven jets with wing cracks have already 
been fixed and that the Civil Aviation Authority had agreed that the others 
could fly as long as they were checked after every 10 trips. 
</P>
<P>
 The Concorde, launched by British Airways in 1976, is the only plane in civil 
use that can break the sound barrier. A Concorde trans-Atlantic trip is about 
half that of a non-supersonic aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 The airline spokeswoman said engineers first found a four-inch crack in a spar 
near the rear of one plane, then discovered similar but smaller cracks in the 
others near where the delta wing joins the fuselage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still don't know what caused the cracks . . . it's under investigation," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She could not say exactly when the cracks were discovered, only that it was 
sometime after early May. 
</P>
<P>
 She added that the airline suspected the cracks could be linked to the 
dramatic temperature swings that the supersonic aircraft are subjected to.

USAIR DEAL LOOKS POSSIBLE, ANALYSTS SAY; LABOR: THE CARRIER AND PILOTS ARE FAR 
APART BUT WILLING TO TALK ABOUT PAY AND A UNION PLAN TO SWAP WAGE CUTS FOR 
OWNERSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 USAir Group Inc. and its pilots union are further apart on wage concessions 
than expected, but a deal to rescue the troubled carrier from high labor costs 
still looks possible, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the union issued a sweeping proposal early this month to restructure 
USAir in exchange for pay cuts, some analysts had seen the airline implementing 
labor cost savings by September. 
</P>
<P>
 That forecast now looks overly optimistic. "Our best guess is the deal will 
get done by the end of December," said Michael Derchin, airlines analyst at 
NatWest Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 USAir is not under intense time pressure to make a deal, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no deadline . . . USAir is not going to run out of cash, but it's 
going to be a sick company. And the sicker the company, the harder it is to 
turn around," said Glenn Engel, analyst at Goldman Sachs & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Hounded by low-cost competitors in key Eastern markets, USAir has since 1990 
lost money every year, including $350 million in 1993. It has said it expects 
to lose more than that this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "No company can drag on like this much longer," said Vivian Lee, analyst at 
Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's sixth-largest carrier has said it is ready to talk with its 
pilots. "We will sit down and discuss their proposal with them," spokesman Dave 
Shipley said in an interview last week. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the company feels "a certain urgency" but that no date for 
negotiations has been set. USAir has rejected key portions of the pilots' plan 
but has also said it sees positive aspects in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Ison, spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Assn., said he expects talks to 
be scheduled in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 3, the USAir Master Executive Council of the Air Line Pilots Assn. 
said it would swap $750 million in wage cuts over five years for 25% ownership 
of USAir and $700 million in preferred stock for employees. The airline's 
39,000 other employees and managers would also grant $1.75 billion in pay 
concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilots' plan came in response to the airline's proposal in July to cut 
annual operating expenses by $1 billion through an unspecified combination of 
labor and other cost reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 The union, which represents 5,250 USAir pilots, said last week that it plans 
to explain its proposal to members and other employees in open forums scheduled 
for eight cities. "The pilots have to go out on the road and talk to their 
people," Derchin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, their plan as a whole is widely seen as unworkable. It "clearly can't 
be accepted in today's form," Engel said. 
</P>
<P>
 British Airways, which has invested $400 million in USAir, immediately 
rejected the pilots' call for further investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after the proposal came out, Standard & Poor's cut its ratings of 
USAir's preferred stock and three debt instruments. Market price declines in 
USAir bonds followed. 
</P>
<P>
 USAir's three other unions have not endorsed the pilots' proposal. The Assn. 
of Flight Attendants called it a starting point on Aug. 5 but rejected key 
provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Transport Workers Union has no firm position on the proposal, a spokesman 
said. Officials at the International Assn. of Machinists could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilots' proposal is "a huge step in the right direction," said Engel, who 
added he does not have the sense that the pilots see their plan as a 
take-it-or-leave-it offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you view this as a first step in a negotiating process, then there is 
reason to be optimistic," he said.

 Canadians Cut Back on Cross-Border Shopping: Canadians are making fewer day 
trips to the United States, indicating that cross-border shopping may be 
falling sharply.Canadian residents took 3 million day trips across the border 
in June, the smallest number since June, 1988, the government statistical 
agency reported. That was down 1.4% from May. Cross-border shopping accelerated 
during the recession but has been steadily dropping since early 1992. Analysts 
say that reflects the U.S. dollar's nearly 15% rise in value against the 
Canadian dollar in the past 2 1/2 years, making U.S.-bought goods more 
expensive for Canadians.

 Foreign Buying of U.S. Firms at Record Pace: Due to a weak dollar and 
relatively low U.S. interest rates, foreign concerns spent $26 billion on more 
than 300 acquisitions, joint ventures and minority investments in American 
companies in the first half of the year, KPMG Peat Marwick said in a report. In 
1993, foreigners spent $33 billion on 570 deals in the United States. British 
firms accounted for four of the six largest U.S. deals in 1993 but only one of 
the top half a dozen so far in 1994 -- SmithKline Beecham's purchase of 
Diversified Pharmaceutical Services from United Healthcare.

 Firms Can Be Inspected Without Warning: Foreign representative offices can be 
inspected without warning under a new Vietnamese government statute, according 
to a report Friday in the Vietnam News.Vietnam's Ministry of Trade said 
representative offices, which are not allowed to conduct direct business 
activities, could face fines of up to $500,000 if they are found violating 
their terms of reference. Offices operating without a license will be fined 
$50,000, the newspaper reported. Authorities in Ho Chi Minh City, the business 
center of southern Vietnam, are reportedly alarmed by a rise in illegal 
activities conducted by representative offices and are revoking some office 
licenses. These activities include importing and exporting goods without a 
permit.

 In a bid to curb widespread use of U.S. dollar bills, the Vietnamese 
government has served notice that most foreign currency will have to be 
channeled through banks beginning Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The aim of the measure decided by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet is to control an 
estimated $600 million now circulating in dollar notes and to increase use of 
the Vietnamese dong, a senior government economist said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The intention is not to hurt the people but to restore order," the economist, 
who asked to remain anonymous, told Reuters. "For the government, it's a very 
necessary measure. The dollarization of Vietnam's economy is very unusual for 
any country." 
</P>
<P>
 About 70% of the hard currency turnover in Vietnam was by state companies, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now people are keeping money under the mattress -- we need to get it into the 
banks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some estimates say as much as $2 billion is in circulation in communist 
Vietnam, which started diversifying trade and seeking foreign investment in the 
late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The measures require Vietnamese organizations to channel the hard currency 
they earn through banks rather than holding it in cash, and for most cash 
payments to be made in dong. 
</P>
<P>
 The economist said the decision would have no effect on foreigners and that he 
did not think it would affect the exchange rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiet's decision, reported by the official Vietnam News Agency, means that all 
currency proceeds from export transactions and services provided to foreigners 
will have to be deposited in banks licensed to trade in foreign currencies.

 Unemployment Drops to Three-Year Low: Employment rose to a record in July and 
the jobless rate fell to a 37-month low. The number of jobs created in the 
month soared 90,200 to 7.97 million, compared to a rise of nearly 15,000 that 
forecasts had foreseen. The jobless rate slipped to 9.5%, its lowest since 
June, 1991, from 10% in June this year.

SELLING INNER CHINA ON THE SATELLITE AGE; TELECOMMUNICATIONS: U.S. FIRMS PITCH 
PHONE SYSTEM FOR REMOTE VILLAGERS IN THE NATION'S INTERIOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Herdsman Ma, deep in the great Chinese outback, the telephone is something 
newfangled that his village and hundreds of others have never seen. 
</P>
<P>
 But if some ambitious U.S. companies get their way, Ma and isolated villagers 
like him may soon be using the "electric talk" -- the literal translation for a 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
 A vast remote network is now possible via a constellation of low-orbit 
satellites tied into the world's most advanced telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the Iridium, Globalstar and Teledesic and satellite systems 
still on the drawing board are eyeing China's phoneless interior as perfect for 
their technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remote villages that have never had telephones could set up Globalstar 
satellite phone booths for just $1,500 to $2,500 each," executive Anthony 
Navarra said at a Beijing forum where he pitched Globalstar to 200 telecom 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 He said hand-held mobile telephones using the same technology would give 
reliable voice and computer data service anywhere in China -- whether from a 
bustling Shanghai street or the desolate oil fields of the Taklimakan desert. 
</P>
<P>
 China's drive to leapfrog out of the communications dark ages with massive 
investment in top technologies has triggered an invasion of Beijing by the 
world's telecom executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the telephone penetration rate has tripled to 2.15% from just 0.7% in 
1988, this still amounts to fewer than 40 million phones for 1.2 billion people 
-- one of the lowest densities in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing that poor communications could cripple economic growth, China is 
spending $6.2 billion this year alone in its quest to have 140 million phones 
by 2004. At least $7 billion in foreign capital will be used this decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Satellite mobile phone systems are seen as a sensible alternative to the huge 
expense of laying fiber optic or even copper cable to the remote interior. 
</P>
<P>
 They also could help quench the voracious appetite for communications in 
China's cities, where cellular phones have tripled in two years to 400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Communist government, citing national security concerns, insists on 
total control over China's telecommunications and has barred foreign ownership 
or management in its network. 
</P>
<P>
 The trick for Globalstar and other foreign providers is to persuade Beijing it 
will not sacrifice its sovereignty by granting them access to the explosive 
telecommunications market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Globalstar . . . can provide low-cost, advanced telecommunications services 
to the whole nation while affording the Chinese government full control of the 
network inside China," Navarra told the Beijing forum. 
</P>
<P>
 The technologies are breathtaking in a country where until only a few years 
ago, home telephones were out of reach for all but the Communist Party elite. 
</P>
<P>
 As early as 1998, a pocket-sized Globalstar mobile phone or fixed "village 
satphone" could digitize Herdsman Ma's words and beam them from a tiny antenna 
to any of 48 Globalstar satellites orbiting 450 miles overhead.

 Imports, Exports Find Balance: A renewed export push has whittled away at 
China's worrying trade deficit, bringing imports and exports into rough balance 
in the first seven months.The official New China news agency last week said 
exports in the January-July period surged by 31.2% from a year earlier to 
$58.74 billion. Imports grew at 19% to $58.81 billion, outstripping exports by 
just $70 million and boosting overall trade by 24.8% to a new high of $117.55 
billion, the news agency said. July exports grew by 35.7% to $10.35 billion, 
and imports rose only 9.7% to $9.62 billion.

 Giordano Holdings Chairman Resigns: Jimmy Lai has resigned his chairmanship of 
Giordano Holdings, one week after China closed the clothing retailer's Beijing 
store, apparently in retribution for criticism of Chinese Premier Li Peng that 
Lai made in his popular Hong Kong weekly Next magazine.Lai resigned at his own 
will from the company he founded in 1981, said Jimmy Chan, Giordano executive 
director. The Chinese government did not pressure the company to force Lai out, 
Giordano Chief Executive Peter Lau said, nor did his board pressure Lai. 
Chinese authorities officially cited incomplete licensing arrangements in 
closing Giordano's recently opened Beijing outlet, but the move was widely seen 
as retribution.

 Bankruptcy Debt Plunges: Total debt from bankrupt Japanese companies in July 
fell 46.3% from a year earlier, largely because of a drop in large-scale 
bankruptcies, according to a private research and rating company.The 
$3.45-billion total was the sixth-largest ever for the month of July, Tokyo 
Commerce and Industry Research Co. said. In July, 1,120 businesses failed, down 
4% from a year earlier and down 3.4% from June. Bankruptcies among large 
companies with debts exceeding $10 million dropped to 51 in July from 82 a year 
earlier, and those with debts below $1 million rose to 710 from 671.

 PENTAGON RIVALRIES: The Defense Department is preparing for another bitter War 
Between the Services in the face of the Clinton Administration's efforts to 
eliminate overlap and duplication among the military branches. A commission is 
to begin considering the issue next month, but the battle already has begun: 
The Marines are wrestling with the Army over whether the Corps should be 
allowed to acquire more tanks and transform itself into a second full-fledged 
land force. And the Air Force is in a shootout with the Navy over which should 
serve as America's primary air-bombardment force -- Air Force heavy bombers or 
Navy carrier-based jets. The infighting will be intensified as the services 
compete for fewer available budget dollars. Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is pressing for greater cooperation but 
is meeting resistance. "This could be the biggest knock-down, drag-out 
turf-fight of its kind in years," one Pentagon veteran said.

 SMOKIN' JOE: Oil problems kept a race car sponsored by tobacco giant R.J. 
Reynolds Co. from finishing the nationally televised Brickyard 400 stock car 
race in Indianapolis earlier this month. But its presence hardly went 
unnoticed. Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), a leading congressional critic 
of smoking, says that the car, adorned with the image of a camel and a "Smokin' 
Joe's Racing" label, breaks laws against advertising tobacco products on 
television. Waxman asked the Justice Department to investigate, saying in a 
letter to Atty. Gen. Janet Reno that "public health and the protection of our 
children deserve nothing less." R.J. Reynolds spokesman David Fishel laughed 
when told about the letter. "I watched the Brickyard 400 and I couldn't even 
find the damn car," Fishel said. "It wouldn't be real effective advertising, if 
that was what we were trying to do." The company later issued a statement 
saying it decided to sponsor the car because "a significant portion" of race 
fans are smokers. The car will continue competing in the 31-race NASCAR Winston 
Cup series, which is sponsored by none other than R.J. Reynolds.

 PARENT POWER: "The right of parents to direct the upbringing and education of 
their children shall not be infringed." That's the language being proposed for 
a Parental Rights Amendment to state constitutions. Of the People, a 
grass-roots lobby trying to mobilize support for the amendment, says its plank 
and similar proposals have been introduced in seven states and it has 
commitments in eight others. The amendment aims to give parents more muscle in 
challenging school boards over curriculum and opposing the distribution of 
condoms and the availability of abortions to minors.

 GREAT THOUGHT: Secretary of State Warren Christopher was chatting with 
reporters who cover the State Department about one of his favorite subjects, 
baseball, during a refueling stop on his way back from a recent trip to the 
Middle East. The subject turned to Cal Ripken Jr., shortstop for the Baltimore 
Orioles. One reporter noted that a highly respected Washington Post 
sportswriter regards Ripken as the best shortstop in history. But another 
reporter countered that the Post sportswriter "is always writing that whoever 
he covers is the greatest." The comment prompted the droll secretary of state, 
who hasn't been drawing rave press reviews, to quip: "What a good idea."

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I am writing to you to ask about the timing of signals at the corner of 
Sepulveda Boulevard and Greenleaf Street in Sherman Oaks, where an entrance to 
the San Diego Freeway is located. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing of the left-turn signal from northbound Sepulveda onto the freeway 
is extremely short on the weekends, sometimes not even allowing one car to get 
through if that driver is not alert the exact second the light changes -- let 
alone any other cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Shouldn't any signal let two cars through at a minimum? The timing there seems 
fine during the week, but on the weekends something needs to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Kusnitz, Sherman Oaks 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 We brought your problem to Brian Gallagher, a traffic engineer with the city 
of Los Angeles, who says that maintenance crews have been dispatched to check 
whether the electronic sensor is working properly at that stoplight. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, that left-turn signal should give 12 seconds of green on weekends 
as long as there are cars on the detector, which should be ample time to allow 
several cars through the intersection, Gallagher says. 
</P>
<P>
 As to whether all signals should give at least enough time for two cars to 
pass, you're right, they should. Gallagher says that even the shortest signal 
in the city, provided there are cars waiting, stays green for five seconds -- 
sufficient time for at least two cars to go through. 
</P>
<P>
 And after that, there's always the yellow light. Which, if you've spent any 
time driving in L. A., you know often means time for another 10 cars. 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 As a Newhall resident who cannot car-pool, I'm ecstatic at the reopening of 
the Golden State-Antelope Valley freeway interchange, but curious as to the 
status of the post-earthquake diamond lane on the southbound side. 
</P>
<P>
 As much of the 14 Freeway is only three lanes from Sand Canyon to San 
Fernando, this leaves only two lanes for solo drivers. I anticipate horrific 
delays as more and more commuters revert to pre-shaker schedules, because this 
freeway used to clog up from Sierra Highway right on down to the interchange in 
the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Are there plans to take out the diamond lane? In addition, what is the 
schedule for eventual widening of this section of freeway? 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Cook, Newhall 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 That new diamond lane was indeed a post-earthquake measure designed as an 
incentive to get commuters to share rides. But as with the car-pool lanes put 
in on the Santa Monica Freeway after its collapse, they weren't meant to last 
-- and indeed, they should now have vanished, says Rick Holland of Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
 However, expect a rebirth in the not-so-distant future. To your question of 
whether the freeway will be widened, the answer is yes, but the extra lane will 
be for car pools, not for those who drive alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The diamond lane is to run all the way from California 126 to Sand Canyon 
Road. Holland says the anticipated completion date is sometime in 1997.

BEACH VOLLEYBALL; DODD, WHITMARSH WIN AT SEAL BEACH

 Mike Dodd's soft, arcing dink shot seemed to hang in midair, waiting for Kent 
Steffes to slide under and put it back into play to keep his team's 
championship hopes alive. 
</P>
<P>
 With every step toward the ball, however, Steffes seemed to go nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 After what seemed like forever, the ball came to rest in the sand, giving Dodd 
and partner Mike Whitmarsh a come-from-behind 15-14 victory in overtime at the 
final of the Miller Lite Open beach volleyball tournament Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best Open I've ever played in," Dodd said after defending the 
title. "It doesn't get any more exciting than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Dodd is no stranger to the victory stand. In 14 years playing professionally, 
he has won 63 times, including five times here. 
</P>
<P>
 What made the victory so incredible was how he and Whitmarsh overcame deficits 
of 11-6 and 14-12 to stage a comeback that came down to the final seconds on 
the rally clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Steffes and partner Karch Kiraly reached game point after Dodd and Whitmarsh 
seemed to expend the last of their energy chasing down a pair of wayward shots. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Dodd dived toward the back edge of the stands to run down a loose ball, lifted 
it back over his head, where Whitmarsh had to maneuver around the referee stand 
and a ball shagger in a hopeless effort to keep the rally alive. 
</P>
<P>
 After a timeout during which Whitmarsh never left his landing site under the 
referee stand, he was able to gather himself and stuff an errant pass from 
Steffes to cut the lead to 14-13. 
</P>
<P>
 That was quite a feat, but after trading sideouts, only 4 1/2 seconds remained 
on the rally clock, which meant Dodd and Whitmarsh had to score on their next 
serve or time would expire. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodd lifted his serve to Kiraly, who got the set back and pounded it off 
Whitmarsh's block only to see Dodd get it back to Whitmarsh, who made an 
off-balance spike over the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiraly ran down the shot and again was set up to put the game away, but his 
spike went directly at Dodd, who made the dig, got it back and put the ball 
right down center to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nine out of 10 times, Karch hits that ball right off my nose," Dodd said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the crowd on its feet, Dodd returned to the service line and again made 
Kiraly receive. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiraly tried to get his spike through the arms of the 6-foot-7 Whitmarsh, but 
Whitmarsh got enough of the ball to enable his partner to make the dig. 
Whitmarsh then gave Dodd the set and the 36-year-old dinked the ball just in 
front of Steffes for the winning point. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Kent got stuck in the sand a little bit," Dodd said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd went berserk. So did Dodd, who ran around slapping the hands of 
spectators and pumping his fists in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Kiraly looked back on the last plays of the match as the turning 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we put away any of those two balls, especially the one with four seconds 
left, we win," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodd and Whitmarsh pointed to a pair of lift calls on sets as a big 
opportunity to crawl back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we were lucky they called a couple throws on Karch," Dodd said. 
"Those two were critical." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was having trouble keeping my hands dry," Kiraly said. "I was using my bump 
set the whole tournament. I should have stuck with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitmarsh said a change in strategy also helped his team because recently he 
has been having trouble blocking Steffes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had success with Kent earlier in the year, but lately he has had my 
number," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiraly said he has noticed the new tactics by Dodd and Whitmarsh since 
returning from a kidney injury in late July. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since I've been back from my kidney injury, the five times we've played them, 
they've been serving me every time," Kiraly said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the women's final, Cammy Ciarelli and Holly McPeak came out of the losers' 
bracket to defend their title with two straight victories over Brazilians 
Sandra Pires and Jackie Silva. 
</P>
<P>
 The first match was dominated by Ciarelli and McPeak, who shot to a 10-0 lead 
and won, 15-3. 
</P>

 The pair had to come back in the double final, which is only played to seven. 
Pires and Silva jumped to a 3-0 lead before Ciarelli and McPeak battled back 
for a 7-3 victory.

MINOR LEAGUE NOTEBOOK / ELLIOTT TEAFORD: FORMER SCC PITCHER BLACK WELCOMES 
SECOND CHANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 David Black and baseball have a thing going. It's lasted for years. He loves 
baseball, loves pitching. But the game frequently has jilted him, leaving him 
an emotional wreck at least once. 
</P>
<P>
 He has tried breaking it off, but the lure of the game is intoxicating. Black, 
a right-handed pitcher from Southern California College, keeps coming back for 
more. Since graduating, he's played in Ecuador, almost journeyed to Canada and 
now, after three unsuccessful attempts to quit, has landed a spot with the 
Class-A San Bernardino Spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 You might think Black is blissful now, happy to be pitching professionally 
after a two-year struggle to find a minor league team that would take him. You 
also might think he has his emotions under control after wrestling with them 
since graduating from SCC in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong. He is still a bit confused. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the chance to play," he said. "I love the opportunity to pitch, but 
baseball itself has treated me poorly. The funniest thing is that my friends 
are happier for me than I am. I do know I love to pitch. I have fun pitching 
and I have fun meeting new people." 
</P>
<P>
 So, Black simply enjoys the fact that he's being paid to throw a baseball past 
another man. Further analysis would merely cloud the issue at this point, and 
Black wants things as simple as possible right now. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows he's not on a fast track to the major leagues and that he's lucky to 
have a job. The Spirit is an independent team, unaffiliated with any big league 
club. Many of the team's players are either castoffs or couldn't-cut-its from 
other teams, although it's doubtful any of them can match Black's past. 
</P>
<P>
 He wouldn't be playing for San Bernardino if not for what he calls "an 
emotional breakdown" at Los Angeles International Airport, a phone call from a 
friend and the Spirit's desperate need for pitching help. 
</P>
<P>
 Black pitched in Ecuador last summer and hoped to return again this season, 
but after contract talks broke off he weighed other options. One involved 
playing in Canada, but he was unsure that was what he should do. 
</P>
<P>
 He served as SCC's pitching coach this past season and had earned a promotion 
at the restaurant where he has worked for the past 6 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the hardest decision to make in my life, career-wise," said Black, 0-0 
with a 6.75 earned-run average in 10 2/3 innings for the Spirit. "I was so 
uncertain about my future and my present state of growth." 
</P>
<P>
 Nagging worries filled his head. "If I go, how is this going to impact the 
next 10 years of my life?" he wondered. 
</P>
<P>
 At the last minute, he decided to go, hastily tossing some things into a 
suitcase and heading to the airport. Once at LAX, the panic hit. In the end, 
couldn't talk himself into getting on the plane, so he cashed in the plane 
ticket and returned home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided there was nothing wrong with this trip," he said. "I just didn't 
want to go. I didn't want to leave. Finally, I gave myself permission to quit 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, the Spirit, acting on a tip from former SCC pitcher Tim 
Fortugno, called Black. Again, he wasn't sure it was what he really wanted to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Tim, 'Honestly, I really don't know. I'm confused,' " Black said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, he went for a tryout. The Spirit liked Black's arm and signed him 
on July 21. 
</P>
<P>
 But before the deal was done, Black had one request: Could he continue working 
part time for the restaurant? The club agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "And now I'm in Modesto," he said during a phone interview from the team's 
hotel. "It's really easy to get caught up in the fantasy. But it's not easy to 
go through the grind from hotel to hotel, trying not to watch too much trash 
TV." 
</P>
<P>
 With only a few weeks left in the season, Black is determined to avoid 
thoughts of what's next. At this point, he's not certain he will play 
professionally again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm doing what I thought I would always do," he said of playing in the 
minors. "If it ended tomorrow, I'd be bummed, but I know I could be happy doing 
something else. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I got some offers, yeah I would consider (playing next year). Right now, 
there are no offers. I want to keep my mind clear until there are other 
offers." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 You normally wouldn't find recommendations on how to spend a summer night in 
This Space. But if you're thinking of watching some minor league ball while the 
big boys are on strike, This Space suggests heading for Lake Elsinore's new 
ballpark, The Diamond. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels' new Class-A home -- they were based in Palm Springs for many years 
-- will remind you of a smaller version of Camden Yards. Or perhaps Tempe 
Diablo Stadium, the Angels' spring training base in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Elsinore's ballpark has an old-time feel, with its red-brick facade and 
green wrought-iron gates. But other appealing features include a grassy 
embankment down the right-field line that serves as the cheap seats, luxury 
boxes and a restaurant above the left-field corner. 
</P>
<P>
 And after stumbling to one of the worst starts in professional baseball, the 
Storm is leading the California League's Southern Division. 
</P>
<P>
 If you go, take a close look at hard-hitting catcher Todd Greene, projected to 
be one of the Angels' stars of the future. He is hitting .293 with 28 home runs 
and 104 runs batted in.

KEHRLI WON'T LET STROKES STRIKE HIM OUT; FOOTBALL: QUARTERBACK FROM CORONA DEL 
MAR HAD BRIGHT FUTURE AT LOUISVILLE, BUT SERIOUS INJURY FORCED HIM TO SWITCH TO 
BASEBALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Todd Kehrli was mesmerized by the pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Louisville football coach Howard Schnellenberger sat in the living room three 
years ago and removed his Super Bowl ring and his national championship ring, 
setting them on the coffee table. The message was simple: Come with me , son , 
and you could wear these someday.  
</P>
<P>
 Kehrli, a quarterback from Corona del Mar High School, was sold. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach Schnellenberger had the reputation as being a great quarterback coach," 
Kehrli said. "I thought I would go there and be his quarterback. Good things 
would happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Kehrli thinks about Louisville from time to time and wonders, just who will be 
Schnellenberger's quarterback this season? Marty Lowe? Jason Payne? His two 
friends are competing for the spot this summer. But Kehrli doesn't linger on 
the question too long. He has to get back to the business at hand, rejuvenating 
a baseball career at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
 Good things didn't happen to Kehrli at Louisville, not in the end. At one 
time, he was on track to be Schnellenberger's quarterback, or at least audition 
for the role. Then a freak accident in practice changed his course. 
</P>
<P>
 Kehrli was hit in the neck by a teammate at the end of a play, pinching an 
artery and causing a blood clot. He suffered two strokes in two days and was in 
the hospital for nine days. He nearly died, then was nearly blind. It was clear 
there were no rings in his future, not from football. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm never going to get over football," Kehrli said. "It was something I lived 
for, the crowds, the pressure, the game itself. It's so exhilarating. That's 
gone now, so I have to stay busy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kehrli, a 6-foot-4, 219-pound first baseman, hasn't played a baseball game 
since 1992, his senior year at Corona del Mar. Still, he called OCC baseball 
Coach John Altobelli as soon as he returned from Louisville last September and 
enrolled for the spring semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Altobelli was happy to have anyone tryout. But it didn't take him long to 
realize Kehrli was a little different than the usual wanna-be. 
</P>
<P>
 "He started hitting balls onto Fairview Road," Altobelli said. "We haven't had 
someone do that here in a long time. I just got a new scoreboard and now I have 
to put up a net or Todd might start knocking holes in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Such power would have helped the Pirates last season. But Kehrli suffered a 
relapse. He developed blurred vision and doctors discovered another blood clot, 
though not as severe as the previous ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he was put on medication and could not play. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kehrli is not the type to let setbacks slow him down, no matter how big. 
After all, this is a guy who as a kid pitched an entire game with a broken 
wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a blind spot, so baseball was a problem at first," Kehrli said. 
"Curveballs would come out of nowhere and fly balls would drop from the sky. 
But it's fine now. I've adjusted." 
</P>
<P>
 Mentally as well as physically. 
</P>
<P>
 "Todd has been amazing," said Sterling Kehrli, his mother. "He's taken this, 
'Life goes on,' attitude. And fortunately, he's had something like baseball to 
fall back on." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Kehrli hasn't thought about what might have been. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think about Louisville that much," he said. "Once in a while, maybe. 
I did buy a college football magazine, just to see who was going to be the 
starter. But it's not like last year. I was at a sports bar every week to watch 
the game. Now, I'm looking ahead a little more." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's better than looking back. 
</P>
<P>
 Kehrli's football career was hardly a thing of beauty, even before he got to 
Louisville. Oh, he had talent, that was obvious, but his career was always 
being interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
 He played only seven games as a junior after he cut the little finger on his 
throwing hand during a cookout. He played only six games his senior year after 
he suffered a dislocated elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 But, when he did play, he was good. Kehrli helped the Sea Kings win the 
Southern Section Division VI title as a sophomore. His career numbers were good 
-- 3,415 yards passing and 23 touchdowns -- and his size appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Todd had everything we look for in a quarterback," said Gary Nord, Louisville 
offensive coordinator. "We not only look for kids who have ability, we look for 
kids who are willing to pay the price to get to the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
 That sounded good to Kehrli. He also knew Schnellenberger was responsible for 
about $62 million in NFL quarterbacks, from Jim Kelly to Browning Nagle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under Coach Schnellenberger's system, I figured I could have a lot of 
success," Kehrli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing happened the first two years to change that opinion, on either side. 
Kehrli was going to be the team's No. 2 quarterback last season, behind senior 
Jeff Brohm. He was being groomed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Todd had the strongest arm of any quarterback we've had here, including 
Nagle," Nord said. "He was our future." 
</P>
<P>
 The future turned bleak last September. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the final scrimmage before the Cardinals' opener against San Jose 
State. Kehrli went back to pass and was sacked. As he started to get up, a 
teammate speared him from the side. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt a sensation in my shoulder and thought it was a stinger," Kehrli said. 
"When I got back to the dorm, I lay down and everything started spinning. I 
stumbled to the bathroom and threw up blood." 
</P>
<P>
 Kehrli was taken to the hospital in an ambulance, but doctors said it was only 
food poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Kehrli was swimming and began to feel queasy. An ambulance was 
called and Kehrli passed out on the way to the hospital. It was four days 
before doctors were able to diagnose the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Kehrli had suffered two strokes. The hit had pinched the artery in his neck, 
causing blood clots. When he regained consciousness, he was blind. 
</P>
<P>
 By that time, his mother had arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's always had a high threshold of pain," his mother said. "One year in high 
school, he kept playing basketball with a broken leg. Finally, the bone 
snapped. So, when he told me in the hospital that he wasn't feeling well, I 
knew something was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 The blood clots were discovered and he was put on medication. Doctors told him 
he probably would never play football again. Kehrli clung to the "probably" 
until two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors then advised him never to play again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a million-to-one shot that he would ever get hurt like that again," said 
Bruce Kehrli, his father. "But it was a million-to-one shot the first time, 
too. Todd didn't want to take the risk." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kehrli hadn't swung a bat since leaving high school, but he was hardly a 
novice. He was a four-year starter in high school and hit .425 as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
 If not for football, he might have chosen baseball as a career from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some kids just have athletic ability," Sterling Kehrli said. "Todd's always 
excelled at everything he did. He could have been a good tennis player, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Kehrli had decided to play baseball after returning home. He left Louisville 
immediately after being released from the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't feel comfortable there any more," he said. "I could have gone 
to school, but what if I had another stroke? I wanted to be home." 
</P>
<P>
 Kehrli has had few problems since returning home. Doctors have even told him 
he should have no further blood clots from the injury. 
</P>
<P>
 But getting back to his athletic peak took some work. His left arm and 
eyesight were affected by the strokes. He went through rehabilitation, using 
everything from weights to coloring books, to regain mobility in his arm. 
</P>
<P>
 His eyesight also has improved. 
</P>
<P>
 Regaining his baseball skills has taken some work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything Todd hits is a rocket," Altobelli said. "Right now, he's a 
football kid, just muscling everything. He has to polish up those skills. When 
he does, he's going to be pretty exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's a pitch Kehrli likes to hear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Football was my love, now that's gone," Kehrli said "I have to do something." 
</P>
<P>
 And who knows, there might be a ring in it for him someday.

JACK SMITH: ANOTHER SKIRMISH IN PLAYBOY BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I did not expect to be widely loved for my column applauding a federal judge 
for overturning a county ban on the presence of Playboy magazine in fire 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
 My point was that the magazine was essentially harmless, and that it might 
help firemen to while away the hours between alarms. I noted also that various 
women's magazines that I looked at while waiting for a manicure were much more 
prurient and sexually explicit than Playboy. 
</P>
<P>
 Diana York Blaine of La Verne writes, "When he argues that the prurience of 
women's magazines outstrips that of his favorite soft pornography, he misses 
the crucial difference." (I am always missing the crucial difference.) 
</P>
<P>
 She goes on: "Every article aimed at women readers encourages them to be 
something other that they (presumably) already are: better in bed, quieter, 
slimmer, more pleasing to men, responsible for birth control, etc." 
</P>
<P>
 Both magazines, she says, give women and girls the message: "The outside 
package is all that matters and you are born to serve. These rags tutor women 
to strive to become the very fantasy bimbo airbrushed into the pages of 
Playboy, not independent human beings." 
</P>
<P>
 I think those magazines should be in every waiting room. If nothing else, they 
help pass the time while waiting for a manicure. I learned, for example, how to 
have multiple orgasms. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Heidi Ferrer writes that "Women in Playboy, as in much of society, are the sex 
object. I repeat, object . Why then, do you think, Mr. Smith, that women's 
magazines have those articles about how to be sexy or what to do in bed? It's 
not separate, Mr. Smith, it's because of influences like Playboy." Well, if 
Playboy encourages women to look sexy, I see nothing wrong with that. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrer notes that I wrote "the female figure has not changed much over the 
millennia," and points out that "the female figure in Playboy has changed even 
less." She argues that "all the bodies in Playboy are very similar. That being 
projected as sexy or ideal is part of the problem. There are a multitude of 
different female figures. Look on the street, Mr. Smith. Do they look like the 
women in Playboy? Does your mother? Does your wife?" 
</P>
<P>
 I'd rather leave my mother out of this, but the fact is, she was thin as a 
mannequin until the day she died. As for my wife, she could have been a bunny 
in her youth, and she still looks good enough for the cover of Glamour. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidently to show that she is not just jealous of sexy women, Ferrer describes 
herself as 24 years old; 5 feet, 8 inches, and 125 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "See," she says, "even women blessed with a figure close to society's 
'standard' are sick of women being trampled on. We will never be equal if we 
are objects." 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, Ferrer addresses her letter to "Mr. Smith," noting that she does 
so "out of respect for the older generation." The truth is that no one 
appreciates the female form more than us old geezers. We might even be inspired 
to put out fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrer asks: "How about the men who read Playboy? Is it harmless to them? What 
if a man goes through his life thinking that this is the way women should look, 
the way his woman should look? What if he beats his own wife because she 
doesn't measure up?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Katherine Chiljan of Northridge writes, "I wonder if you really understand 
what the objectification of women means? It is the divorcing of women from 
their personhood, reducing their entire being to simply their gender. It is 
this mentality that directly or indirectly leads men to commit sexual 
harassment and rape. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "How could you even compare women's magazine articles with Playboy? The 
women's articles you cited are not lurid, one-sided talks on the male sex; they 
are frank discussions on problems and pleasures of sex, with the aim of making 
it more enjoyable for both men and women. For affecting sexual behavior there 
is no contest between photos of naked women poised for sex and those women's 
articles. 
</P>
<P>
 "You, Jack, are among the brainwashed zillions who are slaves to their gender, 
and Playboy magazine (is) one of the masters who keeps you in chains. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Chiljan says she especially objects to my statement that "What would be more 
likely to inspire (a firefighter) to this act of bravery (fighting a fire) than 
pictures of live young women?" 
</P>
<P>
 "The message being," she writes, "if you are brave you will be rewarded with 
sex." 
</P>
<P>
 It's been that way since the days of King Arthur. Isn't it said that "none but 
the brave deserves the fair"?

FIRST PERSON: COMMITMENTS; ON THEIR OWN TERMS; IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT 
EUPHEMISM

 Hello, I'd like you to meet my companion . . . no . . . roommate . . . no . . 
. live-in lover . . . no. What word or phrase accurately describes the woman I 
love and live with? 
</P>
<P>
 This relationship-labeling dilemma needs to be resolved for my grandparents' 
sake, if not for mine. At family functions, my poor grandmother stops and 
stutters whenever she describes the woman who is basically "shacking up with 
her grandson." 
</P>
<P>
 She wiggles her finger at my partner while introducing her in a manner most 
people reserve for extraterrestrials: "This is Rodney's, um . . . marriage is 
important . . . oh . . . special friend . . . sort of." 
</P>
<P>
 For the people in our lives, labels are necessary and convenient. You know, 
Ed's my neighbor, Sue Ellen's my colleague. And this woman I am standing next 
to is my . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Girlfriend: The first and last time I used this word, I hadn't finished 
pronouncing it before she rammed her thumb into my kidney. In a stern tone, she 
reminded me that since the age of 18, she had ceased being a girl. I understand 
her objection. And neither I nor any member of my internal organ family will 
soon forget it. 
</P>
<P>
 Womanfriend: This is the logical extension of avoiding girlfriend . But 
womanfriend makes me sound as if I'm running a cult. "Say hello to my 
womanfriend, Squeaky. Dear, I think the cross on your forehead needs touching 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 Partner: This word reminds me of cowboys or police detectives, not lovers. 
When most people hear partner , they immediately wonder, "What exactly is she 
your partner in ? Counterfeiting? Poppy processing?" Partner won't do. 
</P>
<P>
 Sidekick: Now this label has a nifty ring. Of course, so does bachelor , which 
is what I would rapidly become once again if I ever used it. To her, though, it 
has that faint lounge-act echo: "Hello, I'm Rodney the Magnificent, and here's 
my sidekick. I'll begin tonight's show by sawing her in half." 
</P>
<P>
 Friend: Sure we're friends. But so are the members of my softball team. And I 
don't go to bed with them after a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Close friend: See Friend . 
</P>
<P>
 Live-in lover: It's the most honest label by far. And I'm sure that after 
proclaiming her my "live-in lover," my relatives would quickly revise their 
wills to my detriment and then flop over unconscious. But "live-in lover" does 
have that mellifluous, alliterative quality; it rolls off the tongue like 
"disowned dumbbell." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohabitant: No doubt, an apt description. But one best suited for people who 
live in the Biosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Significant other: If I ever use this term, I'll thumb my own kidney. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, I know most of you are thinking there's an easy, one-word solution to this 
predicament -- one involving blood tests and bridesmaids. But that word sticks 
in my throat like a handful of rice. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought about holding up a cardboard sign that reads: "Please choose one of 
the following options: Girlfriend, Womanfriend, Partner, Sidekick, Friend, 
Close Friend, Live-in Lover, Cohabitant, Significant Other." 
</P>
<P>
 That's when she threatened to hold up a sign that points at me and says: "I'm 
with stupid."

CROWDS SEEK REFUGE FROM LINGERING HEAT; WEATHER: THOUSANDS PACK BEACHES AND 
POOLS. SMOG, POWER OUTAGES ACCOMPANY OPPRESSIVE MUGGINESS, ALTHOUGH THE HINT OF 
A COOLING TREND SPREADS.

<P>
 From Simi Valley to the beaches of west Ventura County, residents and tourists 
sought refuge Sunday from the searing heat that has enveloped much of Southern 
California for the past several days. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures soared into the high 90s inland and hit the low 80s at the coast, 
with thousands of people flocking to public pools, indoor shopping malls and 
the cool waters of the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just packed," said Nadean Hudson, a lifeguard at San Buenaventura State 
Beach. "Almost the whole stretch of beach is covered with people all the way 
down to the waterline." 
</P>
<P>
 Meteorologists said no temperature records were set Sunday, however, as the 
first inkling of a cooling trend began to spread across much of the county. The 
more typical late-night and early-morning clouds were expected to return to the 
coast tonight and Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was no immediate respite for the two hottest spots in the county, 
Simi Valley and Fillmore, where temperatures were expected to climb a degree 
today to 96 and 97, respectively, before beginning to taper off. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, temperatures were expected to range today from the mid-70s at the 
coast to 90 in Thousand Oaks and the Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The hot weather also brought warnings of unhealthful air in Simi Valley and 
Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gary Arcemont, a meteorologist with the Ventura County Air Pollution 
Control District, said smog there peaked under the level at which the district 
issues health advisories to hospitals, parks and schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, Southern California Edison officials said nearly 50 households 
lost power over the weekend because so many people switched on air conditioners 
at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 But all of the outages -- caused when transformers overloaded -- lasted only a 
short time before the utility was able to restore electricity, spokeswoman Cher 
Zervas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had three consecutive days of heat and it hasn't been cooling off at 
night," Zervas said Sunday. "Because it's been so hot, the transformers 
overheat and it takes our crews a little while to fix them." 
</P>
<P>
 The assistant manager at Conejo Valley Ice Skating Center said her business 
was double that of a normal weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rink is cold, so it's a good place to be today," Judy Nessen said. "Some 
people wear gloves, especially the little ones, because that ice is cold if 
they fall. But we have kids in shorts too." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Rancho Simi Community Park pool, hundreds of children were keeping cool 
while participating in a regional swimming competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's extremely hot and very muggy," said Susan Engler of Thousand Oaks, who 
was handing out fresh watermelon and cantaloupe to the judges of the meet, 
sponsored by Conejo Simi Aquatics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing is probably juicy fruits and fluids," she said. 
"They need this hospitality because, over the last hour or two, they've been 
out there in the sun judging the swimmers." 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen-year-old Lianna Kishimoto, a San Fernando Valley high school 
sophomore, said she shaved more than 10 seconds off her personal best in the 
200-meter individual medley despite the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my first time under three minutes," she said, waiting under a 
royal-blue canopy for her number to be called in her next event, the 100-meter 
backstroke. "The heat takes so much of your energy, but I'm doing pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
 Lifeguard Bryan McQueen said he was on the lookout for symptoms of heat stroke 
or exhaustion among the participants and fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you sweat, you lose lots of water, so it's important to use lots of 
fluids. I've been through three of these today already," he said, holding up 
his jug of bottled water. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, Mark and Megan Anderson ignored the high temperatures and 
held their wedding reception outdoors at Conejo Creek Park. 
</P>
<P>
 With decorative streamers, sandwiches and beer, the couple celebrated their 
big day with more than 100 family members and friends and prepared for their 
honeymoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The heat's not bothering us at all," said the groom, a 25-year-old carpenter 
who works at California Lutheran University. "But more of the older people from 
church would have come if it wasn't so hot." 
</P>
<P>
 Megan Anderson said the Thousand Oaks heat would help prepare the couple for 
their honeymoon at Lake Mohave at the hot and dry Arizona-Nevada border. 
</P>
<P>
 "We rented a houseboat, so we'll be spending a lot of time in the water," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at San Buenaventura State Beach estimated that more than 7,000 
people crowded the shoreline between Ventura Harbor and the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day's going great, but it's really busy," supervising Lifeguard Kirk 
Sturm said. "We've had more than 60 rescues on State Beach, and that's a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Sturm said a south swell from Mexico created strong rip currents that 
prevented many swimmers from returning to the shore on their own, but no one 
was seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Those currents were welcomed by 15-year-old Cara Anderson of Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been Boogie-Boarding all day," she said, brushing sand from her feet. 
"The waves are really strong and there's a good current, so it's a lot of fun."

STAR SEARCH; ASTRONOMY: THE CLEAR VIEW FROM 8,200-FOOT MT. PINOS LURES HUNDREDS 
WHO GAZE SKYWARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Beyond the big-city lights, the stars stand out in the darkened sky, the 
smoke-like expanse of the Milky Way emerges, and you can imagine what it must 
be like up there in the heavens. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 250 amateur astronomers go to the top of Mt. Pinos near Frazier 
Park on moonless nights for ideal stargazing. Most go for other reasons as 
well, like the magic of capturing a planet, or a star, or some whole galaxy, in 
the lens of their telescope. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing things in the universe that the average man never sees," Amos 
Almeida, a 50-year-old Moorpark truck driver, said one recent Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at galaxies, you see billions of stars millions of light-years 
away," he said. "There's no doubt in my mind that God didn't just create all 
that for us humans. When I'm looking out there, I'm imagining someone else 
looking back." 
</P>
<P>
 At 8,200 feet, the packed parking lot where Almeida set up his telescope is 
considered one of the best places in Southern California for stargazing. 
Amateur astronomers have been using the site for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Far beyond the light pollution that can take the luster off the night sky, 
astronomers such as Almeida can set up their telescopes and -- barring cloud 
cover -- be guaranteed ideal conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm up here almost every weekend there's not a moon," said Almeida, who spent 
close to $10,000 on a new 10-foot-tall telescope with a 25-inch refractor. 
</P>
<P>
 After spending so much on telescopes, the die-hards who come here spend 
countless hours searching for obscure clusters of stars or glowing wafts of 
hydrogen gas clouds called nebulae, where stars are born. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed warmly for the crisp evening, Harvey Freed, a 53-year-old dentist from 
Los Angeles, kneels before his telescope, programming a small computer to track 
a star in the sky. He is one of several dozen amateur astrophotographers 
setting up cameras mounted on telescopes to take pictures of galaxies and 
nebulae trillions of miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the light from these distant celestial bodies is so faint, a typical 
photograph can take up to three hours to make. The computer that Freed is 
programming will track the star and, accounting for the Earth's rotation, keep 
the camera focused on the image as the film is exposed. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony of his meticulous work is that Freed spends more time looking down 
at his machine than looking up at the stars. But it is his fascination with 
those stars that keeps him tinkering. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to shoot galaxies and planetary nebulae that are so far away you can 
hardly imagine," he said. "To think we can capture them in the camera is 
amazing. For me, it's like hunting. Our pictures are our trophies." 
</P>
<P>
 If there is one thing that astronomers such as Freed want to share, it is 
their fascination with the universe. Almost like carnival barkers, they stand 
next to their telescopes and offer the uninitiated a chance to see the stars up 
close. 
</P>
<P>
 Philo Jewett, 40, of Studio City swings his telescope around, picking out what 
might interest a beginner. He points the telescope up to Jupiter, tells a 
stranger about the impacts of meteors from the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9, whose 
effects are still visible, and reminds them to look for Jupiter's moons. 
</P>
<P>
 A photographer by trade, Jewett spends many nights on the streets of Studio 
City with his telescope, offering views of the moon or planets for $1 to 
passersby. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a sidewalk astronomer," he said. "I read once in a science magazine that 
one person out of 100 has never looked through a telescope. I think that gave 
me a mission in life." 
</P>
<P>
 He once let a 75-year-old woman gaze at Saturn and its rings. "She said, 
'There really are rings!' Imagine that, she was surprised to really see rings 
on Saturn," Jewett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not far from Jewett, young people lined up at Almeida's telescope, hoping to 
get a glimpse of the Ring Nebula, which looks much like a perfect smoke ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Murphy, a 37-year-old friend of Almeida who lives in Thousand Oaks and 
works as an engineer for Rocketdyne, explained why he tries to encourage people 
to take a look. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I looked through a telescope, I was 9. It was a darkened night 
and I saw Jupiter. It changed my life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After studying astrophysics and engineering in college, he ended up working on 
rockets used in the space shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I see a novice catch a glimpse for the first time, it's like I'm 
reliving that experience," he said. "Maybe it will change their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Hal Jandorf, 45, who teaches astronomy at Moorpark College, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's why I teach," he said. "It's incredible to see someone get caught up in 
the magic of seeing stars." 
</P>
<P>
 Jandorf was conducting an introductory course for a group from the Los Angeles 
Natural History Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 After a short orientation, he led them down the mountain a few hundred yards 
from the light-sensitive telescopes, then flicked on a large flashlight to 
point out the constellations. 
</P>
<P>
 With his flashlight beam, Jandorf connected the dots that form Scorpio and 
Sagittarius. As the constellations seemed to jump out from the star-speckled 
sky, the group oohed and ahhed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see why it's so addicting," said Karen Veronico, 56, of West Los 
Angeles, who was wearing a "University of Mars" T-shirt and tilting her head 
skyward. 
</P>
<P>
 Veronico and her husband have already bought a $2,500 telescope. She said they 
liked the camaraderie among the astronomers on Mt. Pinos and would return. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't any astronomy snobs up here," she said. "Everybody is willing to 
let you look through their telescopes and explain what you're seeing." 
</P>
<P>
 Except for angry yells when someone drives into the parking lot with 
headlights on -- which can destroy hours of work by the astrophotographers -- 
the astronomers welcome strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the cars and camper vans pasted with bumper stickers -- reading 
"Astronomy is looking up" and "Let the stars get in your eyes" -- people 
gathered in small groups to talk. Someone played the theme to "2001: A Space 
Odyssey." Two college students from Los Angeles laid out beanbag chairs next to 
their car and leaned back to look at the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 The atmosphere is something akin to a huge cocktail party. The group around 
Almeida's telescope grew a little bit larger. Sensing the wait he faced, one 
young man started to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wait a minute," Almeida said. "You're gonna want to look at this. This is 
something you've never seen before."

RULING KEEPS THE PUBLIC IN DARK ABOUT MURDER CASE; COURTS: JUDGE SAYS HE SEALED 
DOCUMENTS TO ENSURE FAIR TRIAL, BUT CRITICS ARGUE THAT FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS 
ARE BEING VIOLATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the early stages of one of the biggest Ventura County murder cases in the 
past decade, prosecutors went to the judge in December with a highly unusual 
request: seal the grand jury transcript and other key court documents from the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 The case involves the slaying and carjacking of Westlake nurse Kellie 
O'Sullivan and the arrest of a 19-year-old defendant, Mark Scott Thornton of 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath went along with the prosecution's 
request from the beginning and continues to support it. 
</P>
<P>
 The result has been that eight months later, the public still cannot look at 
the more than 400-page transcript from the hearing in which prosecutors 
established reasonable cause to try Thornton for the O'Sullivan slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 While McGrath has ruled that release of the transcript and other sealed 
documents could jeopardize Thornton's right to a fair trial, First Amendment 
lawyers in California and across the country disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers say there is no serious fair-trial issue with the Thornton case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The grand jury transcript in this case is not going to prejudice the trial of 
this individual," said Harold W. Fuson Jr., San Diego-based general counsel for 
Copley Newspapers. "It never would have." 
</P>
<P>
 Other legal experts note that famous and notorious criminal defendants from 
Charles Manson to John DeLorean received fair trials before impartial juries in 
Los Angeles County despite international publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, they unequivocally say, Thornton and other lower-profile defendants 
can receive the same in any county in the state, including Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, officials of the Ventura County district attorney's office have 
routinely suggested that reporters look through grand jury transcripts to 
familiarize themselves with other high-profile criminal cases. Nor have 
prosecutors tried to block public access to records in other recent highly 
publicized murder cases in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 To some of the nation's top media law experts, McGrath's ruling to seal the 
transcript in the Thornton case represents a disturbing trend. They charge 
prosecutors, defense lawyers and judges with slowly sealing off the criminal 
justice system from public scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that it's a judge's primary duty to avoid any erosion of the 
public's confidence," said Bruce Sanford, a Washington lawyer who represents 
the media in First Amendment cases. "And that means expediting access to public 
information, and that includes the grand jury." 
</P>
<P>
 Other legal experts agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the more the public knows, the better position they are in to 
understand what's going on in their courts," said Bob Sack, a well-known New 
York First Amendment lawyer. "And it is their courts. It's not a court that 
belongs to the governor, to the prosecutor, to the judge or to the defendant. 
It's the people's court." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of dozens of small steps that have been taken over the past few 
years to make it more and more difficult for the public to examine its judicial 
system," Fuson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of these steps have been taken in the name of protecting someone's 
privacy or the rights of the accused," he added. "They are steps for supposed 
high purposes, but in fact reflect a growing social discomfort that personal 
information (in criminal cases) is widely available and in great demand today." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Thornton case, McGrath should not have sealed any of the transcript 
unless he first had read the entire document, which is unlikely, some legal 
experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 If he had read the document, he would have at least unsealed the portions that 
were clearly not even close to dealing with evidence that might cause fair 
trial rights to be violated, they agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court has to be familiar with the transcript," said Sharon J. Waters, a 
Riverside attorney who won an appeal forcing a trial judge to unseal a grand 
jury transcript earlier this year. "I would be surprised that the entire 
transcript (in the Thornton case) has to be sealed. I would tend to think there 
are some parts of that that could be released." 
</P>
<P>
 The experts conceded that McGrath and other trial judges in California will 
continue to make their own decisions, until the California Supreme Court 
establishes some guidelines on the grand jury access issue. 
</P>
<P>
 But some guidance is already on the books. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 115, enacted in 1990, gives prosecutors permission to forgo public 
preliminary hearings in favor of secret grand jury proceedings. But it also 
requires the courts to make grand jury transcripts public within 10 days 
following an indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kellie O'Sullivan's death, prosecutors did not want to do that, and McGrath 
said they did not have to. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of 34-year-old O'Sullivan, a single mother of a young son, was found 
amid some brush in the Santa Monica Mountains 12 days after her Sept. 14 
disappearance. She had been shot twice in the back and once in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
 In a search that mobilized the Thousand Oaks community, hundreds of people, 
most of whom didn't know O'Sullivan, joined in a massive air-and-land search. 
</P>
<P>
 When arrested in Reno, during the height of the search, Thornton was in 
possession of a handgun and O'Sullivan's 1991 Ford Explorer. He admitted 
stealing her vehicle but denied ever seeing the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County grand jury issued a 14-count indictment Dec. 6 that accused 
Thornton of murder, kidnaping and a special circumstance that qualifies him for 
the death penalty. More than 40 witnesses testified about evidence linking 
Thornton to O'Sullivan's disappearance and death. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after the indictment, Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris, worried 
that defense lawyers would seek to move the trial out of the county because of 
the publicity, received permission from McGrath to seal the transcript. 
</P>
<P>
 Kossoris declined to comment for this story. But in previous interviews and in 
court records, prosecutors have said they believe that there is a "substantial 
probability" that release of the transcript and several other sealed documents 
could harm Thornton's fair trial rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton's attorneys also agree that McGrath made the right call in sealing 
the court documents. The defense believes too that many people have become 
emotionally attached to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the public's imagination was caught by the type of woman Kellie 
O'Sullivan was," Deputy Public Defender Susan R. Olson said in an interview. "A 
mother, a fine woman trying to raise a child. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of that, Mark Thornton has become the symbol to the public of what 
violence has become," she added. "There seems to be a tremendous amount of 
anger and revulsion directed toward him. And I think that will make it 
difficult for him to get a fair trial." 
</P>
<P>
 After The Times and Ventura County Newspapers requested him to unseal the 
documents, McGrath said in open court in April that he eventually intended to 
grant the newspapers' requests. He later said he would not make a decision on 
the matter before late July, when he was set to hear a change-of-venue motion 
filed by Thornton's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 But he changed his mind and ordered them indefinitely sealed after the papers 
asked the 2nd District Court of Appeal to intervene and order the documents 
unsealed. The appeals court, without comment, refused July 21 to intervene in 
the matter. And four days later, McGrath abruptly took a tougher stance, 
ordering the records sealed indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 In his written ruling, the judge said he found a substantial probability that 
release of the documents would prejudice Thornton's right to a fair trial. But 
in the change-of-venue hearing in late July, he also ruled that Ventura County 
is populous enough to find an impartial jury in the case -- a ruling that 
strikes legal experts as inconsistent. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, the experts said, the same criteria is used for deciding whether to 
grant a change-of-venue hearing and whether to grant access to a grand jury 
transcript. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, then, does McGrath believe that the Thornton trial should remain in the 
county while maintaining that the transcript and other key documents should not 
be released?

<P>
 "It's wholly inconsistent, no question about that," Sanford said. "Time and 
time again, it has been shown that fair and impartial juries can be impaneled 
in criminal cases, even in the O. J. Simpson case." 
</P>
<P>
 Others find it inconsistent with a decision handed down by an appeals court in 
San Bernardino in February. The 4th District Court of Appeal overruled a 
Riverside County trial judge and released a grand jury transcript in a 
high-profile case there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to reconcile what the trial judge is doing in Ventura County with 
the Court of Appeal decision in Riverside County," media lawyer Kelli L. Sager 
of Los Angeles said. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, defendant David Lynn Scott, known as the "Ninja Prowler," was 
accused of a string of rapes and one murder. The trial judge read the 
transcript and released all but about 3% of it, saying that portion was 
prejudicial to the defendant's fair trial rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "(There) is no basis for concluding that publicity of the contents of the 
entire grand jury transcript would be so extensive and widespread that it 
threatens to prejudice the entire jury pool so that twelve unbiased jurors 
could not be found," Justice Art W. McKinster wrote in the unanimous ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Waters, who filed the appeal on behalf of the Riverside Press-Enterprise: 
"The trial judge in (Ventura County) should have followed that decision. It 
wouldn't necessarily determine the outcome, but it would provide a structure on 
that case." 
</P>
<P>
 Glen A. Smith, a lawyer representing The Times, said the newspaper is 
evaluating its options, but has not yet decided whether to again attempt to 
have McGrath's decision overturned. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection in the Thornton case is set Sept. 6.

STREET SMART: SAN JON EXIT CONSIDERED POOR ALTERNATIVE TO SEAWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Has anyone from the Ventura Planning Department or Caltrans ever suggested 
redirecting beach traffic from the Seaward Avenue off-ramp to the San Jon Road 
off-ramp? 
</P>
<P>
 It would seem that with a few properly worded and placed signs, the traffic 
backups on Seaward could be avoided. This would provide a low-cost alternative 
to widening the Seaward-Ventura Freeway interchange. 
</P>
<P>
 It's probably the concept of "low cost" that scares people in both 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Millerd, Pierpont 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans Engineer Bob Houle says redirecting traffic from Seaward to San Jon 
would cause more problems that it would solve. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Because the exit for San Jon takes motorists on a circuitous, sometimes 
treacherous route that begins at the freeway, winds briefly down Vista del Mar 
Drive and crosses Harbor Boulevard before finally getting to San Jon. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Houle says, the roads are narrow and unsuited to the heavy 
traffic that flows through the Seaward interchange. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, I got a flat tire on the Simi Valley Freeway and discovered a very 
unsafe condition. 
</P>
<P>
 I got the flat as I was driving east, just before the Stearns Street exit. I 
was in the far left lane, but when I tried to pull over to the shoulder, I 
discovered that there was very little paved shoulder to pull onto -- only about 
two feet worth. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, the median turned into a dusty gravel pit that looked unsafe to 
drive on. 
</P>
<P>
 I ended up having to drive across three lanes of traffic to the right shoulder 
-- a very dangerous thing to do with a flat tire. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is the left shoulder so narrow? Is there any chance that it could be 
widened? 
</P>
<P>
 June Masterson, Moorpark 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 There are nearly as many shoulder widths as there are roads, state Department 
of Transportation Traffic Engineer Bob Houle says. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, Caltrans has some rough guidelines to follow, but those parameters 
change every few years and there are many, many exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for example, portions of the Ventura Freeway in Hollywood and other 
parts of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Have you noticed that there is no left-hand shoulder at all? 
</P>
<P>
 They were removed to make room for more traffic lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation on the Simi Valley Freeway isn't nearly as grim. Although the 
paved shoulder is narrow, it is perfectly safe to cross over it and drive on 
the gravel median, which has space enough to accommodate a semi. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Are there any plans for traffic signals at Rockfield and Bowfield streets 
where they cross Lindero Canyon Road? 
</P>
<P>
 Without the signals, these are dangerous crossings for the many residents who 
live along the side streets as they try to get onto Lindero. 
</P>
<P>
 Elisa Kernochan, Thousand Oaks 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 There are plans to install a signal at Rockfield, but you'll have to wait for 
Thousand Oaks and the county to resolve a dispute over who should pay for the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindero falls on the border between Thousand Oaks and the county, and while 
both agree that a traffic signal is needed, neither wants to pay the nearly 
quarter-of-a-million-dollar cost of installing and maintaining it. 
</P>
<P>
 The county argues that most of the intersection actually falls within Thousand 
Oaks, so the city should pay most of the cost. The city points out that most of 
the traffic at the intersection is generated by motorists on their way to or 
from areas on county land. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerning safety, the intersection may seem unsafe, but it is not the worst 
intersection without a signal, Thousand Oaks Assistant Traffic Engineer Jeff 
Knowles says. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, Thousand Oaks compiles a long list of intersections waiting for 
signals, based on the traffic volume and number of accidents, Knowles says. And 
each year, the city funds about five new signals. The Lindero-Rockfield 
intersection is about 15th on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will eventually install a signal at that intersection," Knowles said. 
"It's just a question of when."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; 'MOST EXCELLENT' TRIATHLON DRAWS MORE THAN 
1,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 1,000 athletes from across the western United States swam, biked and 
ran under hot and sunny skies Sunday during the fourth annual Mike and Rob's 
Most Excellent Triathlon at San Buenaventura State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Triathletes covered a course that included a 1.2-mile swim around the Ventura 
Pier, a 52-mile bicycle route up to Rincon Beach and 13.1-mile run to the Point 
Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station. The race started and finished at the state 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is one of 12 qualifying triathlons for the Iron Man Triathlon held 
each October in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 For newer triathletes, the event also featured a short course competition with 
slightly less intimidating distances to cover, said Mike Epstein, the race's 
promoter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we had a good race out there today, though I think there will be 
slightly longer times posted due to the heat," Epstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have found that people like this race because the course is so flat." 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures along the coast ranged from 79 in Ventura to 86 in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Unofficial long course winners were Alex Begg of San Diego and Kim Carter of 
Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
 The race offered five categories for women and 10 for men. Athletes ranged in 
age from 14 to 60. 
</P>
<P>
 For Mark Edwards, 37, of Westlake, the heat definitely served to slow the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a fast course, but I think the heat was a strong factor in slowing us 
down," said Edwards, who posted an unofficial four-hour, 17-minute time on the 
long course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like participating because of the level of competition that (the race) 
attracts." 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco-based triathlete Kelly Opbroek said Sunday's race was fun and a 
good test of athletic skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a little trouble on the swim portion -- I wasn't expecting the surf to 
be as high as it was," said Opbroek, 28. "But no one passed me on the run 
portion, so I think I did pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
 Epstein said the race netted an estimated $5,000 that will go toward Ventura 
County-based charities. J. E. MITCHELL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An exhibit of high-tech inventions will come to the Ronald Reagan Presidential 
Library and Museum near Simi Valley later this month to show how the defense 
industry has adapted to the post-Cold War world. 
</P>
<P>
 Electric buses, virtual reality and a voice-activated car navigation system 
will be among the high-tech fare. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhibitors at the trade fair, called TEXPO, will include both military and 
non-military companies that deal with advanced transportation, alternative 
energy, telecommunications, computers, health care and pollution control. 
</P>
<P>
 "TEXPO will give visitors a glimpse of how they'll live, learn, work and play 
in the latter half of this decade," said Richard Norton Smith, library 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 TEXPO will run from Aug. 26 to 28. The show will be included in the cost of 
library admission, which is $4 for adults, $2 for senior citizens and free for 
children 15 and under. For information, contact the library at 522-8444.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; 4 WOUNDED IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Four Oxnard residents were shot and wounded in a drive-by shooting near 
Gonzales Road and Oxnard Boulevard in what police said Sunday may be a 
gang-related attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The four victims were driving near the intersection around 9:40 p.m. Saturday 
when another car pulled alongside and opened fire, according to Oxnard Police 
Cmdr.Joe Munoz. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel Lozano and Roberto Ortiz, both 18, suffered minor injuries, as did two 
male juveniles, Munoz said. Because of their ages, the juveniles were not 
identified. Their medical conditions could not be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz was taken to St. John's Regional Medical Center, where he was treated 
and released, according to a nursing supervisor. Lozano was treated at the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Munoz said that as of late Sunday afternoon, no suspects had been arrested. J.

AUTHORITIES SEARCH LAKE PIRU FOR MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A North Hollywood man may have drowned late Sunday at Lake Piru, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 On a weekend boating trip at the lake, the man, whose identity was not 
immediately available, apparently decided to go swimming although he apparently 
did not know how. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we understand is that even though he could not swim, he thought he would 
get into the water wearing a life vest," said Mike Mason, a civilian pilot for 
the Ventura County Sheriff's Department aviation bureau. "However, when he got 
in, he started struggling and floundering about." 
</P>
<P>
 Family members aboard their rented boat threw him three life vests but he 
apparently continued to sink. A man aboard the boat dived into the lake to save 
him but apparently could not get to him in time, Mason said. 
</P>
<P>
 A sheriff's helicopter unit and a search-and-rescue dive team spent several 
hours Sunday evening combing the lake. As of 9:15 p.m. he had not been located.

THE BLADE RENTER; IN-LINE SKATES ARE JUST PART OF THE ACTION AT BEACH STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Inside Glenn Koshi's rental store, the Italians visitingfrom Rome are trying 
on in-line skates sans socks, teen-agers in a corner are noisily gushing over 
Koshi's hot new skate wheels, and a family from Riverside is checking out the 
surfboards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get real busy in the summer," said Koshi, 32, owner of Paradise Beach Co. 
</P>
<P>
 No kidding. On a hot and humid recent afternoon, Koshi's store, which is 
nearly tucked beneath the Huntington Beach Pier, had a solid stream of 
customers. It's been that way, he said, even before summer started. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't had a day off in three months," Koshi said. "They're knocking on 
the door when I get here to open up at 10 a.m., and they're knocking on the 
door when we lock up at night at 7 p.m. And we're open seven days a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Just then, an older guy with a 4-year-old daughter popped in and took a 
soaking wet dollar bill from his swim trunks. "This is for licorice and 
jawbreakers. Thank you," he said, as he and the girl left the store. 
</P>
<P>
 From his position on the boardwalk, Koshi has a ringside seat for the daily 
colorful circus featuring thousands of beach visitors. Young women, dressed in 
some of the skimpiest swimwear this side of lingerie, saunter by. Men parade by 
in various forms of this year's uniform -- long hair, no shirt and cut-off 
jeans . . . unbuttoned at the top by the young Fabios. 
</P>
<P>
 And to those who zip along the boardwalk, Koshi has been the Blade Man -- the 
main man here for in-line skates. Umbrellas, fins, even volleyballs also are 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 "We rent everything in here," Koshi says, smiling and pointing to a price 
sign. 
</P>
<P>
 It's true. You supply the money, and a driver's license, and you too can zoom 
around the coastal bike path with banged-up knees. In fact, for one hour, you 
can rent skates for $6. There are two of you? Hey, take a tandem bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
 When Koshi started in Huntington Beach 13 years ago with his partner, Scott 
Einbinder of West Hollywood, he sold Hawaiian-style shaved ice. When a nearby 
beach rental store became available, Koshi and Einbinder grabbed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Koshi enjoyed skating. But the boom was about to strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "The popularity of in-line skating has just been phenomenal," Koshi said. 
"It's taken off." It got a big boost when the popularity of ice hockey, 
"courtesy of Mister Wayne Gretzky," Koshi added, led to the craze for street 
hockey, played on in-line skates. 
</P>
<P>
 As he spoke, a youngster came into the store. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi, Glenn," said 12-year-old James Shipley as he slurped a snow cone. "What 
are the names of the new boots coming out, huh? . . . Are there any new skates 
that are gonna be nice?" 
</P>
<P>
 Patiently, Koshi answered both questions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the store, Koshi keeps about 75 pairs of in-line skates for rentals, two 
dozen beach cruisers and mountain bikes, another dozen boogie boards and 
several soft surfboards, so first-time surfers don't get hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Mention speed skating and stand back. It's Koshi's obsessive love. He sponsors 
a Team Paradise, composed of skaters who compete around the country. Team 
members Beto Pena from Texas, and Aimee Sanderson of Las Vegas recently raced 
at a regional speed skating competition in Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Koshi was headed with the team to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our team is so good that the only other teams we compete against are the 
manufacturer's national teams," Koshi said. "Those teams are sponsored by 
Rollerblade, and those people are good, but we're holding our own." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, much of his business doesn't have anything to do with rentals. Koshi 
is on the verge of becoming one of the larger sellers of speed skating 
equipment on the West Coast. With four employees, he has begun a mail-order 
business and is coming out with one of the first color catalogues on skate 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 His store also specializes in custom orders dealing with super light speed 
skates that can cost from $300 to $900 a pair. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening a box, Koshi explained that one skater enjoyed the fit of his ice 
skates so much he asked Koshi to make them into in-line skates. Koshi removed 
the metal blades, put on a new bottom sole, and attached a gleaming aluminum 
frame with some of the hottest new polyurethane wheels on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy said he loved his ice skates because they fit like a glove," Koshi 
said. "So, he had me fashion them into in-line skates." 
</P>
<P>
 A woman in a red swimsuit rushed in with her two children, who clamored for 
25-cent suckers. "I only have two nickels. I left my purse with auntie. You 
guys get licorice only." 
</P>
<P>
 "Awwwww, mama. Please! Please!" they urged. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, licorice. Now let's get out!" 
</P>
<P>
 Koshi only smiled.

HOMEOWNER GROUPS EASY FRAUD TARGETS; SWINDLE: EMBEZZLEMENT FROM TWO LAGUNA 
NIGUEL ASSOCIATIONS POINTS UP VULNERABILITY, LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The dancers at Captain Cream, a topless club in a Lake Forest shopping center, 
knew Jim Fitzgerald as a big spender. He could be seen at the club several days 
a week, dropping as much as $500 on tips and drinks in a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
 But unbeknown to hundreds of Laguna Niguel homeowners, Fitzgerald, the 
property manager of two homeowner associations, might have been spending their 
dues money, law enforcement investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald, who was arrested in the parking lot of Captain Cream in June, now 
is in Orange County Jail, awaiting a preliminary hearing to determine if he 
will stand trial on charges that he embezzled about $340,000 in homeowner 
association funds before he was fired as vice president of Seabreeze Management 
Co.  
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald, 45, says he is innocent and broke. He is represented by a public 
defender. 
</P>
<P>
 But sheriff's investigator Donald Lambert says Fitzgerald stole the money and 
then spent the bulk of it "on wine, women and song."  
</P>
<P>
 Since November, 1991, Fitzgerald had been funneling money out of the bank 
accounts of Camden Court Homeowners Assn., representing 188 townhomes, and 
Niguel Ranch Homeowners Assn., which maintains slopes and greenbelts for a 
1,200-home community, according to sheriff's investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 He is suspected of forging the names of association directors on bank 
signature cards that he placed on file with the Bank of Newport, where the 
associations kept their reserve accounts. Then, unbeknown to the associations, 
he created bank accounts in their name at the Bank of Yorba Linda, according to 
court documents.  
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald transferred funds from the Bank of Newport to the Bank of Yorba 
Linda, where he put his own name on the signature cards so he could sign on the 
accounts and withdraw money for his personal use, including paying off credit 
cards, the district attorney alleges.  
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald had a routine method of moving funds from bank to bank, according 
to a report that Lambert filed with the court. 
</P>
<P>
 He would telephone the Bank of Newport requesting a cashier's check from one 
of the homeowner association capital accounts. When he picked up the check, he 
would present a withdrawal slip with two forged signatures of association 
directors, which, Lambert said in an interview, conveniently matched the forged 
names on the bank signature cards. Then he would deposit the cashier's check 
into one of the Yorba Linda accounts he had created. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one, including the auditor in his annual review, discovered anything 
was amiss until May 10, when Lisa Dale, the owner of Seabreeze, went to the 
Laguna Niguel branch of the Bank of Newport to apply for a car loan and noticed 
a $4,000 cashier's check on the desk of the business accounts officer that was 
made out to the Camden Court Homeowners Assn.  
</P>
<P>
 She became suspicious when she was told that Fitzgerald had requested the 
check to pay vendors, especially since Fitzgerald was not assigned to handle 
the bank account and vendors were paid from other funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale said she set about immediately to review the association's financial 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four employees and I took files to my house and did a review of the books, 
and indeed we saw several like transactions," she said. "It was apparent that 
there indeed was a problem.  
</P>
<P>
 "At 1 a.m., I felt that I had irrefutable evidence a crime was committed and 
called the Orange County sheriff."  
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Dale met with sheriff's investigator Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a stroke of luck the way she found out about it," Lambert said. "But I 
think sooner or later the auditor would have found out about it." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason no one noticed that funds were missing, Lambert said, is that 
Fitzgerald had created phony invoices from vendors to look as if the money was 
used for valid expenditures involving the maintenance and repairs of the 
association's grounds and buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald's arrest has stung many who knew him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I was raped," said Lester Garb, president of the Niguel Ranch 
Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Garb described Fitzgerald as "a real roly-poly man with a very nice, jovial, 
ingratiating personality." 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney and others say, however, that the Laguna Niguel incident 
illustrates that homeowner associations and the management firms they hire are 
vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowner associations are governed by boards of directors elected from among 
the residents. Because the directors often have other full-time jobs and little 
management experience, they hire professional managers to help them. 
</P>
<P>
 Large sums of money are handled daily by this young and fast growing form of 
local governance, which has responsibility nationwide for $5 billion stashed in 
reserve accounts for long-range expenses such as roofing, painting and 
emergency repairs, according to the Community Associations Institute.  
</P>
<P>
 "Because associations are a new concept and many people operating them have 
little or no business experience, they are an easy target for professional con 
artists," said Paul Christiansen, a Laguna Niguel real estate broker. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph D'Agostino, a deputy district attorney who prosecutes major frauds, 
said in recent years he has won several large cases in Orange County in which 
property management company employees bilked homeowner associations. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, a manager was sent to prison in 1992 after he stole $377,000 from 
homeowner associations over a four-year period when he worked for three 
separate Orange County property management companies. He was hired by the last 
two companies, Merit Property Management and Marquis Management Group, without 
their knowing that he was under investigation for crimes he committed on his 
previous job. 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, the president of Camden Court Homeowners Assn. said, he would 
have expected the banks or the association's auditor to have caught the money 
drain earlier. Philip Herzfeld also contends the board members should have 
noticed the transfers of funds out of their Bank of Newport accounts when they 
read their bank statements. 
</P>
<P>
 "My own feeling is that everyone shares some of the responsibility," he said. 
"Because of this experience, we are a lot more suspicious and sensitive to how 
things are being done." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald is not talking. He declined to be interviewed about the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigator Lambert said he was able to find only $1,000 in Fitzgerald's bank 
accounts. He "didn't drive fancy cars, and he lived in an apartment in Aliso 
Viejo," Niguel Ranch Assn. president Garb said.  
</P>
<P>
 But Lambert said that Fitzgerald, the divorced father of a teen-age boy, had 
been on expensive yachting trips in the Caribbean and had spent large sums at 
Captain Cream. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would spend $200 to $500 a day on tips and drinks," he said. "According to 
the girls (the topless dancers), he liked to play like the big spender." If 
Fitzgerald is convicted, he could go to prison for up to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale of Seabreeze Management Co. has promised to reimburse both homeowners 
associations for their loss, in part by using a $250,000 fidelity bond posted 
by her firm. 
</P>
<P>
 But she adds that she is not convinced all the missing money is spent and has 
hired a private investigator to look for it, hoping that if Fitzgerald 
transferred stolen money out of state, he will get a longer sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am trying to make a statement through the court system by getting as long a 
prison sentence as possible for Jim Fitzgerald, (one) that will discourage 
property managers anywhere from thinking this kind of crime pays," she said.

VIETNAM VET SCARS PERSIST, STUDY SHOWS; PSYCHOLOGY: UCI RESEARCHER FINDS 
EMOTIONAL DISTRESS MOST SEVERE AMONG THOSE WHO EXPERIENCED INTENSE COMBAT, 
ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO WERE WOUNDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In one of the first wide-ranging studies of Vietnam veterans from all walks of 
life, a researcher from UC Irvine has found that many still carry deep 
emotional scars from the conflict that ended in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although the Vietnam War ended decades ago," Roxane Cohen Silver wrote in her 
study, released Sunday, "it is clear that the psychological consequences for 
its veterans continue into the present." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, said Silver, a professor at the School of Social Ecology, "in many cases 
it has not impaired their functioning" despite public perceptions of Vietnam 
vets as psychologically dysfunctional. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have learned to adapt to their experience," Silver said. "The fact that 
people are still thinking about the war doesn't represent pathology; it 
represents a normal response to an abnormal stressor." 
</P>
<P>
 Silver, who teaches psychology, presented her findings at the annual meeting 
of the American Psychological Assn. in Los Angeles. The study was inspired, she 
said, by a Vietnam veteran's visit to one of her classes just after the Persian 
Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 "I and many of my students were struck by what this gentleman was saying," 
Silver recalled. "It was clear from his presentation that Vietnam vets were 
still living with the war even 25 years later." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1992, Silver said, she has surveyed 1,126 Vietnam veterans throughout 
the country on various aspects of their war and postwar experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most earlier studies, which focused primarily on those who had 
requested help from the Veterans Administration, hers was based on data 
supplied by a broad range of veterans, she said, including doctors, lawyers, 
dentists and university professors, as well as people who were homeless and 
unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really focused on the wartime experience and the postwar social 
environment," Silver said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among her findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * Current ruminations about the war and resulting distress levels were 
significantly greater among those who had experienced intense combat. Among 
those who had been injured, Silver found, the symptoms of distress approached 
those of psychiatric inpatients. 
</P>
<P>
 * Exposure to intense combat was also associated with higher levels of 
hostility and violent tendencies in the veterans' current lives. In some cases, 
Silver said, this was evident by the amount of pressure the veterans applied to 
their pens while filling out the questionnaire. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fifty-one percent of the veterans surveyed reported homecomings that had 
been uncomfortable, and the more negative the homecoming, the more intense 
their current distress. 
</P>
<P>
 * Psychological adjustment was higher among those who had at least one 
longtime friend who was also a veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 * The younger the veteran was upon entering the war, the greater was his or 
her current level of psychological distress. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Silver, there are at least two important policy implications of 
her study. First, she said, the findings suggest that greater attention should 
be paid to debriefing veterans upon their return home from a war. And second, 
whenever possible soldiers should be sent to war when they are older rather 
than younger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no special agenda going in," Silver said. "I can say with confidence 
that most of the research until now has focused on post-traumatic stress 
disorder; my study brings us into a second generation of questions to ask of 
the Vietnam veterans."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; PROPOSALS SOUGHT FOR YOUTH SERVICE GRANTS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city is looking for organizations and individuals interested in running 
two youth service programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council recently allocated $100,000 to fund expanded recreational 
activities and a parent-training program aimed at helping "high-risk" youths 
and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 People interested in applying for grants can pick up applications at City 
Hall. The applications are due Sept. 15. City officials hope to have the 
service providers selected by November, said Maureen Ybarra, Irvine's community 
services superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants are given broad leeway in creating their program proposals, Ybarra 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The recreational programs, which are designed for youths in grades 4 to 12, 
could include anything from model-rocket classes to theater productions. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is also looking for a variety of proposals for the parent-training 
program. Last year, Community Services Program Inc. received a city grant for a 
parent-training service that dealt with such issues as family management, 
communication skills, anger management, conflict resolution and discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said applicants should have at least two years of experience 
providing social services.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; PROGRAM ON WATER SHOULDN'T BE DRY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials know that for years people assumed that water flowed cheaply 
and freely from their faucets and never gave it another thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in more recent times, drought struck and all of a sudden, people were 
washing their cars on alternate days of the week.Last year, the bureaucracy of 
water got big headlines when it was discovered that two local water officials 
were taking money from the contractors to whom they were awarding contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Water has become a substance people want to know more about. On Wednesday, 
Mission Viejo will sponsor a free Water Quality and Issues Workshop in the 
Norman P. Murray Community and Senior Center, 24932 Oso Viejo Road, at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from the three water districts serving the city will be on 
hand to explain the meaning of odd-sounding phrases like "hard water" and 
answer many other questions about rates, where water comes from and what is put 
into it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got some heavy hitters coming in for this workshop," said Nancy 
Herrman, director of senior center. "We're looking for people in our area with 
interest and questions about their water." 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing at the workshop will be a chemist, operations manager and general 
manager from the Santa Margarita Water District, Moulton-Niguel Water District 
and the El Toro Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrman said the program will include slides, presentations from water experts 
and water information pamphlets, but will leave time for questions from the 
community. 
</P>
<P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: STANTON; LEGION POST IN A BATTLE OVER ITS HQ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Snyder used to penetrate the lines of enemy territory as a Marine in 
North Korea. His brigade "almost went clear to the Chinese border," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Snyder, 63, is fighting over flowers, sprinklers and parking 
spaces at Magnolia and Cerritos streets. 
</P>
<P>
 As commander of American Legion Post 783, Snyder is battling to move the post 
into its new headquarters. Before it can start operating there, though, the 
city wants the legion and property owner Dilip Parikh to make improvements, 
including upgrading the landscaping and adding 70 parking spots and new outdoor 
lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle began in May, when the post was forced from its old home by the 
$9,700 monthly rent. Since then, the post has put its business on hold, Snyder 
said. It has no place to hold its fund-raisers, barbecues and rummage sales. 
Much of the proceeds from these benefits go back into the community through 
charitable donations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're being held hostage," said Snyder, who sports a long, gray beard. "It's 
going to cost thousands of dollars to make all those changes, let's not kid 
ourselves, and we just don't have the money." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Planning Commission, however, isn't giving any ground. Twice in the 
last two months it has rejected the legion's requests for a conditional use 
permit -- and what has become a delicate decision is now in the hands of the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the council delayed a vote until mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the appeal to the council, Mark D. Lloyd, the city's planning manager, 
said the property will have to comply with city codes before the permit can be 
granted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the city's responsibility to protect the public's health, safety and 
welfare," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Without more parking spots, an overflow of cars could spill into the 
residential streets, causing parking problems, Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 Without new lights, the area could lure criminals, and the city code requires 
all new tenants to do their part in sprucing up the parking lot before getting 
the permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom DiCarlo, who owns a nearby bar in the Magnolia Center, sides with the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (center) parking lot is full as it is, and people aren't going to park a 
block away and walk to my place in the dark," he said. "If they get in there, 
my business is doomed to failure, and this is my sole source of income." 
</P>
<P>
 A traffic expert hired by DiCarlo found on a recent weekend that the existing 
parking lot was 95% full most of the time, DiCarlo said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Snyder said opponents -- including other businesses in Magnolia Center -- 
are overestimating the post's impact. 
</P>
<P>
 The 600-plus membership might seem large, but really only 50 to 100 people are 
involved on a full-time basis, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One solution would put more parking spots in the back of the center, but a 
legal agreement between the two property owners designates the area as a 
loading and unloading zone, so a compromise would have to be struck, Lloyd 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, Doug Currier, who lives in the apartment complex out back, would 
try to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can already see it," he said. "Engines revving, car alarms going off, a lot 
of people leaving the bars here canned. I'm not talking about the Legion 
people, I'm just talking in general." 
</P>
<P>
 Such an attitude disheartens Snyder, who assumed the position of commander 
three months ago and now envisions terrible squabbles ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were here long before the city was even a city," he said. "Couldn't they 
give us a break?" TOM RAGAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA PALMA; CARWASH REQUEST FACES OPPOSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents opposed to another carwash business in the city are gearing up for a 
battle in city hall at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, when the City Council holds a hearing 
on an application for a carwash at Crescent and Moody streets. 
</P>
<P>
 A newly formed La Palma citizens group, Save the Vision Committee, has mailed 
a letter to residents, urging opposition to the carwash application. The 
committee contends that La Palma already has more than enough carwashes. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee said the choice for the city "is between being known as the 
Kingdom of the Carwashes or Truly the City of Vision."' 
</P>
<P>
 The applicant, Paul Son, said in an interview he thinks a new carwash would be 
an asset for the city and consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 "More competition (in business) is good," he said, adding that the public 
benefits whenever several businesses compete for customers. Son also said 
neighbors near the proposed carwash do not object to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The Save the Vision Committee was formed recently around the idea that 
residents are taking a back seat to businesses in decisions by city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In its organizing letter sent as a mass mailing, the group said: "A number of 
us in La Palma have become increasingly concerned that the 'City of Vision' has 
lost its direction and that it needs all of our help to refocus its goals and 
objectives." 
</P>
<P>
 "City of Vision" is La Palma's motto. The new citizens group contends that 
residents need to be more militant in watching City Hall if the "vision" motto 
is to be true. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether it be providing city services, enforcing city codes, or planning for 
future growth, we feel that our city has forgotten that the needs of the 
'residential community' should be their No. 1 priority," the letter said. "For 
this reason we decided to form the 'Save the Vision Committee.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Save the Vision Committee, in its letter about the car wash issue, said 
the choice for the city "is between being known as the Kingdom of the Car 
Washes or truly the City of Vision."' 
</P>
<P>
 The council meetings is at 7:30 p.m. at City Hall.BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; HARBOR ASSN. ADDS FREE PARKING HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BEAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Starting today, free parking at the Dana Point Harbor will be extended to late 
afternoons and nights Mondays through Thursdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to merchants and customers who criticized a program to install 
gates and charge for parking, the Dana Point Harbor Assn. in late June returned 
free parking on a limited basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Lamb, an association spokeswoman, said the latest change -- adding 
more hours of free parking -- is an effort to respond to complaints about the 
pay-to-park policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been telling people, 'We're really not trying to keep you away,' " Lamb 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last April, gates were installed in the Mariners Village and Dana Wharf 
parking areas to counter what large leaseholders and restaurateurs considered a 
serious parking problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies showed that spaces were being occupied by employees, beach-goers and 
boaters, along with shoppers. For 21 years, parking at the harbor had been 
free. 
</P>
<P>
 The parking rate of $2 an hour and $18 a day for the lots will continue on 
Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. Restaurants, retail shops and sports 
fishing docks offer various validations for free parking. JEFF BEAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; SCHOOLS TO CONSIDER COMPLAINTS POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Capistrano Unified School District board is scheduled to consider a new 
policy tonight on how to handle parents' complaints about instructional 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed policy sets out informal procedures through which principals 
would seek to resolve complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 If necessary, the district superintendent would appoint a five-member 
reviewing committee consisting of a district administrator, the district 
librarian, a school-site administrator, teacher and parent. The parent would 
not be chosen from the school where the complaint was lodged. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacqueline Price, district spokeswoman, said some parents have raised concerns 
in the past over instructional materials about AIDS and other sexually 
transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a couple of parents object to it, saying, 'This is the role of the 
family,' " Price said. JEFF BEAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; CABLE TV TALK SHOW ON COUNCIL AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Have any questions concerning Costa Mesa? Intrigued by the immigration issue? 
The plight of the homeless? Gang problems? Cultural harassment? Cultural 
differences? 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa residents may soon find a forum for these community issues via a 
new cable network television talk show coming to the community this fall -- 
that is, if the City Council approves the idea at its meeting tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an opportunity for a format that will foster a good attitude with the 
ethnic changes going on about us," said Karen McGlinn, chairwoman of the human 
relations committee for the city of Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's not to be the gripe line," she adds. "It's not for people to call in 
and complain about potholes. It's so the citizens can become educated about the 
changing face of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 If approved tonight, the talk show would air beginning in October on Channel 
61, a public-access channel. Citizens could place calls to City Hall during the 
week, and the show's host, who has yet to be named, would respond to them by 
week's end. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials will be interviewed to give citizens a peek into how Costa Mesa 
works, and prominent citizens will give presentations on a local clubs, 
organizations and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Copley Colony Television will train the volunteers who will create and host 
the show, McGlinn said. They will include college students interested in a 
broadcast or public relations career. The host will be selected by the Human 
Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first effort in by the city to generate dialogue among 
citizens. A few years back, residents would gather in their living rooms once a 
week and discuss issues affecting the city. But enthusiasm soon tapered off. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now we're going to bring the living room to them," McGlinn said. TOM 
RAGAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; TERM, GIFT LIMITS SET FOR FINAL COUNCIL OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residential design guidelines for Old Town Tustin, a possible time limit on 
the length of council meetings, and a proposed law that would prohibit people 
from sleeping in parked vehicles at night are among the agenda items coming 
before the City Council today. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the council will consider endorsing Proposition 187 on the 
November ballot. The controversial initiative, dubbed Save Our State, would bar 
illegal immigrants from receiving public schooling, non-emergency health care 
and social services. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members will also consider giving final approval to measures that 
would impose term limits on city commissioners and place restrictions on gifts 
received by municipal officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, the council gave preliminary approval to a proposal that 
prohibits members of the Planning Commission and the Parks and Recreation 
Commission from serving more than three consecutive terms. Each term lasts two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jim Potts, who introduced the measure, said that an influx of new 
commissioners results in fresh perspectives and helps avoid a "burnout factor." 
The commissioners are appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The term limits measure passed unanimously and without debate at its initial 
reading. 
</P>
<P>
 The council was divided, however, on the issue of restricting gifts that 
public officials receive from people doing business with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 3-2 vote, preliminary approval was given to a measure that would prohibit 
elected officials and city employees from accepting $250 or more in gifts 
during a calendar year. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed law is slightly stricter than a statewide measure that will take 
effect Jan. 1. The state law, which expands the Political Reform Act, will 
prohibit state and local officials from accepting more than $270 in gifts 
annually. That figure will be adjusted every two years based on changes in the 
Consumer Price Index. 
</P>
<P>
 When the proposal to limit gifts was debated by the council two weeks ago, 
Potts and Councilman Michael J. Doyle argued unsuccessfully that public 
officials should receive no gifts at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Prevailing in the debate were Mayor Thomas R. Saltarelli, Councilman Jeffery 
M. Thomas and Councilwoman Tracy Worley. 
</P>
<P>
 They all agreed that accepting no gifts whatsoever would be overly 
restrictive.ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; 10 LATINOS WIN $1,000 SCHOLARSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ten Orange County high school students will receive $1,000 scholarships at the 
seventh annual awards luncheon of the Efren Herrera Scholarship Foundation at 
11:30 a.m. Saturday at the Tlaquepaque Restaurant in Placentia.  
</P>
<P>
 The foundation is a private, nonprofit organization that raises money to aid 
college-bound Latino students. 
</P>
<P>
 It was created seven years ago by Herrera, former place-kicker for the Seattle 
Seahawks and Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League and Manuel A. 
Ramirez, presiding justice of the Fourth District Court of Appeal in San 
Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 "All our students are honor graduates from their respective high schools," 
said Ramirez, the chairman of the scholarship committee. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that money for the scholarships was raised by the Celebrity Golf 
Classic held June 6. 
</P>
<P>
 The scholarship award for the male student with the highest grade-point 
average and SAT score will go to Heriberto Hernandez Jr., a graduate of 
Saddleback High in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The female winner is Marcia Valadez, a graduate of Rosary High in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven students are winners of the foundation's Merit Scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 They are Fabiola Estrada, a graduate of Loara High, Anaheim; Miguel Gomez, 
Santa Ana High; Eliseo Amezcua, Saddleback High; Michelle Cornman, Rosary High; 
Julie Reyes, Fountain Valley High; Adrian Montero, Tustin High, and Elpidia 
Martinez, Santiago High, Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Flores, a graduate of Magnolia High in Anaheim, is the winner of the 
Carl Ekern Memorial Scholarship Award. 
</P>
<P>
 All the scholarship winners will attend four-year universities.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; COMPUTER WHIZ HELPS NAB SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A computer wizard from a local company that specializes in security systems 
has helped police find a man they are questioning in connection with two 
murders in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Alan Ford, an imaging system specialist for the North American Video 
Corp., helped Orlando detectives reconstruct the identity of the man, whose 
face was partially obscured by the time and date superimposed on videotape 
recorded by an automated teller machine security camera. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando police had originally distributed the marred videotape to local 
newspapers and television stations in hopes of catching the man, whom police 
are questioning in connection with the stabbing death of a 55-year-old woman on 
July 10. The woman's ATM card was used to take cash from her bank. 
</P>
<P>
 When no leads developed, homicide detectives mailed Ford their footage after a 
Florida sales representative from the video corporation tipped them off to 
Ford's computer expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 The 36-year-old computer whiz surgically removed the time and date, 
reconstructed the suspect's face to the best of his ability, then sent the 
finished product back to Orlando early this month. When the restored footage 
was made public, leads began to pour into the police station. 
</P>
<P>
 A 32-year-old man arrested Aug. 5 on charges of soliciting prostitution is 
being held for questioning in connection with the slaying of Bette Shea, whose 
ATM card was stolen after she was killed inside a flower shop in Orlando, 
Detective Bud Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Homicide detectives believe the same man may also be responsible for a second 
slaying, in which a 32-year-old woman was stabbed to death inside an Orlando 
business Aug. 2, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man has not yet been charged in either slaying, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "The enhanced photo helped us tremendously," Jones said in a telephone 
interview. "We got his name through a tip. Somebody called in, but only after 
the photo came out in the local paper." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ford: "It's a pretty exciting thing for us over here. There had been no 
leads at all and this was the only piece of evidence police had. But within one 
week, they were able to catch the guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Ford said special medical imaging and graphic computer enhancement software 
allowed him to reconstruct the suspect's face successfully, in much the same 
way as a criminal sketch artist would. He said there was a 25% margin of error 
in his work. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't use this in a court of law anyway," Ford said. "More than 
anything, it's just a memory-jogger for the public, so that somebody might 
recognize someone who looked like this." TOM RAGAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 La Habra Neighborhood Housing Services Inc. has $1 million and is eager to 
give it to at least 40 first-time home buyers who have low to moderate incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency will assist first-time home buyers who otherwise could not afford a 
home, said Avelina Rosholt, the program's coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Home buyers are given low-interest loans of up to $32,000 to help make down 
payments, Rosholt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is to process 40 or more (loans) in the next 12 months," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify for a loan, first-time home buyers must buy a home in targeted 
neighborhoods in La Habra or Whittier, where Neighborhood Housing Services has 
built homes. Applicants also must make less than $70,560 in annual income. 
</P>
<P>
 A seminar on how to buy a home for the first time must be attended by 
applicants as well. Spanish translation is available.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton is participating in a worldwide study to evaluate 
medication used for treating oral herpes, commonly known as cold sores. 
</P>
<P>
 A few students have already signed up for the study, and the Student Health 
and Counseling Center will be recruiting more subjects once the fall semester 
begins Aug. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to get 40 patients to enroll in the experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 The study is a double-blind trial in which neither the patients nor the 
doctors know who is being treated with a new cream manufactured by Burroughs 
Wellcome Co. of North Carolina; another medication now in common use, treatment 
or a placebo cream, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burroughs is giving the university about $36,000 for participating in the 
trial.MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; HOT-AIR BALLOON FESTIVAL IS RELOCATED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Relocating a hot-air balloon festival venue farther from a Tustin neighborhood 
has deflated fears of many residents about the event, which will feature 
performances by the Beach Boys, Randy Travis and America. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-day festival will be staged farther away from a residential area 
than had been planned, and one of the proposed parking lots has been 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Approval for the Smith's Festival of Ballooning was unanimously granted at a 
special meeting of the city License and Permit Board last week, after event 
organizers addressed concerns about traffic, parking, noise and safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival will be held Sept. 23 to 25 near Tustin Ranch Golf Course on an 
undeveloped parcel owned by the Irvine Co. The major sponsors are Smith's Food 
and Drug Centers and the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
 A main attraction of the festival will be mass launches of up to 150 hot-air 
balloons in the early morning and late afternoon. Each night there will be 
balloon "glows," in which tethered balloons are illuminated by internal bursts 
of flame. 
</P>
<P>
 Those flames have been a source of concern for some Tustin Ranch residents, 
who worry that a ballooning accident could cause a fire. Neighbors have also 
expressed concerns about noise, litter, traffic jams and festival-goers parking 
in residential neighborhoods. Up to 60,000 spectators are expected over the 
course of the three-day event. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the worries were allayed recently when the festival organizer, Korff 
Enterprises in Irvine, decided to move the festival away from homes near 
Pioneer and Peters Canyon roads. Concerns also decreased after the License and 
Permit Board disallowed a parking lot next to Pioneer Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival will be held on a 30-acre, triangular-shaped site bounded by 
Tustin Ranch Road, Jamboree Road and Portola Parkway. The new siting was 
welcome news to Jim Pelachik, president of the Serrano Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Pelachik said tensions "dropped dramatically" among his neighbors after the 
ballooning festival was moved south. "It could turn out to be a very nice 
affair," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Manazer, treasurer of the Presidio Homeowners Assn., said her neighbors 
are "rallying around" the festival now that they feel it is "far enough away to 
be safe." 
</P>
<P>
 One person who is unhappy about the new location, however, is Sally Ann 
Miller. She lives on South Riviera near the golf course. "Everything that got 
moved away from you got moved toward me," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Event organizer John Korff offered assurances that the festival will be a 
safe, family-oriented affair that will provide fund-raising opportunities for 
the Boys and Girls Club of Tustin and the Tustin Schools Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Children's activities will include pony rides, a petting zoo, storytelling and 
POG tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not looking to bring the wrong element around," said Korff, who also 
holds balloon festivals in New Mexico and New Jersey. By booking "mellow" 
musical groups, he expects to draw peaceful crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not having Metallica and AC/DC," Korff said. 
</P>
<P>
 He predicted that the typical spectator will be a 40-year-old father who 
brings his young children to watch hot-air balloons float away as the Beach 
Boys launch into "Good Vibrations." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who have questions about the festival can call a 24-hour hot line at 
(714) 753-4560.

TWO TEEN-AGERS WOUNDED BY GUNSHOTS OUTSIDE RESTAURANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two teen-agers were wounded by gunshots late Saturday night as they stood 
outside a fast-food restaurant known as a popular hangout for youngsters, 
police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Agripino Reynaldo Abat Jr., 19, of La Mirada and Roseller Alverado, 18, of 
Garden Grove were shot about 10:40 p.m. at a Taco Bell at 7878 Valley View 
Ave., Sgt. Phil Dascenzi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two young men were driven to a nearby residence and police were called, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Abat was taken to La Palma Intercommunity Hospital and Alverado was taken by 
helicopter to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo. Their 
injuries were not considered life-threatening, Dascenzi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the shooting were sketchy. Dascenzi said police had not yet 
determined whether the incident was gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were tons of witnesses and nobody knows who did what," Dascenzi said. 
"We don't know who were suspects and who were onlookers." 
</P>
<P>
 He described the fast-food restaurant as a hangout for teen-agers and said 
much of the crowd dispersed after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 No suspects had been identified and police were continuing their 
investigation.

STABBINGS RESULT IN ONE DEATH AND TWO INJURIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One man was killed and two others were injured Saturday in two unrelated 
stabbing incidents, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The first victim was discovered about 6 p.m. on the sidewalk of the 200 block 
of South Magnolia Avenue, Anaheim, suffering from multiple stab wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The 42-year-old victim, whose name was not made public before his relatives 
were notified, was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange, where he was 
pronounced dead. Police said he had been in a fight with another, unidentified 
person, but they did not know what started the quarrel. No suspect is in 
custody, and the investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 The second incident occurred about 10:15 p.m. in Placentia when four men 
started to fight in a restaurant in the 200 block of Santa Fe Avenue. The fight 
moved to the restaurant's restroom, where two men were stabbed.  
</P>
<P>
 The two assailants, identified as Francisco Sanchez, 29, and Hector Ramirez, 
24, were arrested by police on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 The injured men, Jose Sauzta and Raul Silva, were taken to a local hospital, 
where they were in stable condition, police said.

RESTAURANT VANDALS SUSPECTED TO BE ANIMAL LOVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheriff's investigators were looking into the possibility that animal rights 
activists may have vandalized a McDonald's restaurant early Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 A fountain was thrown through a plate-glass window of the restaurant at 30305 
Street of the Golden Lantern, and its walls were spray-painted with slogans 
such as "Die Center" and "Meat is Murder," Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Hector 
Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage may have been done between 1:30 and 4:30 a.m. Sunday, when no one 
was at the restaurant, Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fountain thrown through the window had been removed from the front of the 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, vandals who were apparently animal lovers targeted one of the few 
county restaurants serving buffalo meat. A window at G & G International 
Pizza/House of Buffalo in Costa Mesa was smashed and a cardboard sign bearing 
the words "buffalo killer" was left inside the restaurant.

VALLEY CHRONICLE: LANGUAGE IMMERSION SCHOOLING DRAWS PRAISE, SPARKS FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Both Hamlin Street School in West Hills and Limerick Avenue School in Canoga 
Park offer language immersion programs in Spanish and English, but for several 
reasons, according to the program adviser, Anglo parents are keeping their kids 
away in droves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's because they panic when their children enter first grade and 
learn to read in Spanish before English," says Frances Rodriguez, the Los 
Angeles Unified School District's Language Academy head for the Valley, "and 
because it is a pilot program, so there is uncertainty about how well their 
youngsters will be preparing for high school and college." Rodriguez says she 
thinks the parents' fears are understandable, but groundless, adding that the 
program is based on a successful French-English model that has been in place in 
Quebec for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is set up so that during kindergarten and first grade the 
instruction is taught 90% in Spanish and 10% in English, with the percentages 
leveling off to 50-50 by the fifth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Since English-speaking students struggle more during the earlier grades in the 
program, it is not unusual for the Spanish-speaking youngsters to help, 
Rodriguez says, and the fallout from that is an interesting program plus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hoped busing would create better understanding (among) students of diverse 
backgrounds, but it didn't really. This program succeeds in doing that," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 She adds that she thinks the advantages for Spanish-speaking students are 
obvious. They learn to read in the language they grew up with, and then 
gradually work into English. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rodriguez believes that the advantages to English-speaking youngsters may 
be more subtle, but no less compelling, and that being bilingual will reap 
benefits for these students throughout their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Rodriguez is sensitive to the anxieties that Anglo parents have 
about their children's progress. She says she realizes that they think their 
children will lag behind other Anglo children headed for college, but adds that 
the evidence suggests this is not true. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez says she thinks all bilingual students will be better off, 
educationally, by the fifth grade, and either on a par or academically superior 
to those who have not had the advantage of bilingual education. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara and Rush White of West Hills are two parents who agree wholeheartedly. 
They put their son, Jared, into the program the first year it was offered at 
Hamlin during the 1992-93 school year when he was in kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though it was a pilot program, we thought the opportunity was too good 
to pass up, and after a couple of weeks of apprehension about the language 
barrier, Jared -- who is going into his third year in the program -- 
enthusiastically agreed," Barbara White says. 
</P>
<P>
 White says an experience she had in high school made her open to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to Mexico with the Taxco-Canoga Park sister city program when I was at 
Canoga Park High School and forged friendships there I have kept ever since. 
When I went to UCLA I took Spanish and encouraged my husband, whom I met there, 
to take it. My facility with the language got me employment with Mexicana 
Airlines, which I enjoyed for 16 years," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 White adds that she considers this program to be the best possible preparation 
for her son, who will be working in the 21st Century when being bilingual may 
be a business necessity, not just a plus. 
</P>
<P>
 She also says that her son learning to respect both cultures and languages 
makes the program even more desirable. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a sentiment Rodriguez shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez says that there is room for more children in both the Hamlin and 
Limerick programs and that interested parents may contact her through the Los 
Angeles Unified School District, or call one of the schools after Sept. 1. The 
schools have open enrollment, so students do not have to live in either of the 
schools' boundaries to attend. Woodland Hills Woman At Home All Over Map

 Jackie Sant-Myerhoff's job calls for a number of diverse qualities. 
</P>
<P>
 She is in charge of troop movements, hiring, lodging, diplomacy, matchmaking, 
Mother Superior-ing and coping with the unexpected. She also needs to speak a 
little of almost every language on earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Sant-Myerhoff is the area administrator of the Cultural Homestay International 
organization, headquartered in Northern California, and the Woodland Hills 
resident only has to look at a map to be reminded of groups she has either 
coming or going all over the place. 
</P>
<P>
 She administrates five programs for the northern section of Southern 
California, including those that send local high school students to foreign 
countries for a couple of weeks, months or a school year, and other programs 
that bring foreign students here. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the newest programs has local students visiting Russia this summer, and 
a group of Russians have come here. 
</P>
<P>
 Another program brings young college students from European countries, 
particularly France, to work with local businesses. "It's part of their 
curriculum in business school, and necessary to graduation, Sant-Myerhoff says. 
</P>
<P>
 She says she started out with the organization in the early '80s, when she was 
host for a visiting student, but has since advanced to her present, paid post. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many exciting things happening in the world today, and being 
involved in cultural exchanges is one way that you can really feel a part of 
that," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 She adds that there is one benefit of her job that money just couldn't buy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost anywhere on earth I go now, I know families who have asked me to share 
their home," she says. "It makes traveling so much more personal and enjoyable, 
to see a country the way the people there do." Overheard: 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife says the only reason she stays with me is that she considers turning 
me into a human being is a lifelong work-in-progress. I think she's worried 
about getting custody of the Range Rover."

TIPPER GORE'S MISSION OF MERCY; RWANDA: ON A VISIT TO L.A., SHE RECOUNTS TALES 
OF LIFE -- AND DEATH -- IN REFUGEE CAMPS. 'I HAD TO SEE THE CHILDREN . . . LET 
THEM KNOW THEY WERE LOVED.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Tipper Gore came to Los Angeles, but she didn't bring her Rollerblades, her 
red glitter drum set or even her campaign to clean up the music industry.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she brought haunting, horrific images of the sick and dying Rwandan 
children she had visited earlier last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I entered one room and saw two babies were dead, so I went on to the next 
room to help with giving baths to the sick ones still alive. They all had 
cholera. All had diarrhea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I picked up a little boy and I thought, 'This child feels so hard. Why? 
What's wrong?' And then I realized, this child was a skeleton. A skeleton. Skin 
stretched over bones, that's all. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the sort of conversation one expects to be having with Tipper Gore 
-- code name "Skylark," homecoming queen of the Clinton Administration, Vice 
President Al Gore's more interesting and effusive half. 
</P>
<P>
 As Second Lady, she has made headlines for losing weight, wearing slinky gowns 
and collecting Grateful Dead albums. But she is a quiet yet powerful voice for 
children's rights. 
</P>
<P>
 This mother of four has also used her 18 years in political fishbowls to build 
a national reputation as a respected champion for the homeless and the mentally 
ill. She is now President Clinton's mental health adviser to his Task Force for 
National Health Reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Until her husband won his first bid for Congress in 1976, she planned to 
practice child psychology -- a discipline in which she holds an advanced 
degree.  
</P>
<P>
 But it was as a mother -- and a mother who almost lost a child when son Albert 
III was struck by a car in 1989 -- that Gore went to Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life is so fragile and so precious -- every life," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Her voice is husky, even breathless, as she tries to describe what life -- and 
death -- is like in refugee camps in Zaire, where at least 180,000 children are 
"unaccompanied." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry for the way I sound," she whispers. "I've been in 13 time zones in 
the last seven days and this is what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Gore came to Southern California on Friday to campaign for gubernatorial 
candidate Kathleen Brown and to address the American Psychological Assn.'s 
convention on the future of the family. 
</P>
<P>
 It was her first trip since journeying privately to the place where one of the 
greatest and swiftest-moving concentrations of refugees in history is coming 
together in one vast and throbbing mass. 
</P>
<P>
 She went, she says, to "just see what I could do to help." 
</P>
<P>
 "I originally talked to my husband about it and he wanted to go, but that 
seemed too difficult logistically. I wanted to slip in to see how these young 
soldiers of ours are holding up, how they're handling it. And I had to see the 
children, hold them, let them know they were loved." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, UNICEF officials say, Tipper (nee Mary Elizabeth) Gore, the eternal 
cheerleader, did more than lift the spirits of the troops. She saved lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes all a doctor needed was someone to hold an IV bag or help get 
someone to a field hospital," she says with a shrug, "and so I did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of the experience still brings tears to her pale blue eyes. But she 
doesn't apologize or try to hide her emotions. She wraps her tangerine-colored 
silk suit tight around her arms as she describes how, in equatorial Africa, 
some children never stop shaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "They shiver at night because they are so cold and there is no electricity to 
warm them; they shiver in the day because they are burning up from fever." 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles from the orphanages and refugee camps, Gore slept in a sleeping 
bag in a tent and dined on MRE rations with her soldier-hosts. "The tuna noodle 
with cheese sauce wasn't bad. (And) I had a chocolate nut cake, naturally." 
</P>
<P>
 A semi-recovered chocoholic, Gore is perhaps the only woman ever to diet 
successfully during a political campaign. At 5 feet, 5 inches, she has 
maintained a near-svelte goal of about 130. 
</P>
<P>
 She is a born-again fitness buff, an accomplished drummer (she played for the 
all-girl band the Wildcats in her pre-Al days) and is considered one of the 
most genuinely polite women in Washington politics. 
</P>
<P>
 When Frank Zappa disclosed the cancer that took his life earlier this year, 
she sent him a sympathy note. This, despite the fact that he had called her "a 
cultural terrorist" for her campaign to label musical recordings. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, she will celebrate her 46th birthday -- the day her husband's boss 
celebrates his 48th. 
</P>
<P>
 Will her husband give her Rollerblades again? Or something more useful? Like 
chocolate.

 In a brightly lit laboratory at Caltech, Jasmine Anderson uses a red marker to 
hastily sketch what appears to be a ladder. Excitement laces her explanation of 
research involving DNA, which many of us are familiar with at least in context 
of another set of initials: O.J. 
</P>
<P>
 We understand that DNA is important to Simpson's forthcoming murder trial, 
that it has something to do with blood and hair samples and what might become 
of a flickering football star. 
</P>
<P>
 But beyond that, many of us know nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson is a peer coach in Caltech's Summer Undergraduate Research 
Fellowships program, SURF for short, which reflects researchers' attempts to 
make technical information more understandable to those of us who fled high 
school science classes with our Cs and Ds and never looked back. 
</P>
<P>
 For many of us, our view of science is nebulous, similar to our view of tax 
laws -- too complicated to deal with, too unapproachable, too easily deferred 
to accountants. For this, we pay. We are gulled by advertisers' scientific 
half-truths and confused about researchers' conflicting findings. Is Chinese 
food good for us or what? 
</P>
<P>
 We are vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all that, we sense that work being done in labs like this is 
important. We hope for cures. We hope for ozone. We hope for sweet and sour 
that won't kill us. We hope that the people we elect to public office -- with 
their MBAs, their law degrees, their real estate licenses -- understand science 
better than we do as they decide critical issues involving the Earth, which has 
become a more technical place with each spin on its axis. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of us have not kept up. We might recall high school encounters with 
frogs, lifeless and supine, tentatively sliced to smithereens, chemistry 
experiments that belched fumes and smelled bad. But little else. 
</P>
<P>
 The project Anderson is working on is titled "Sequence Selective Cleavage of 
DNA by a Synthetic Rhodium Complex in vivo ." 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us back to the ladder. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, 20, is a senior chemistry major at Caltech. By fourth grade, she was 
reading Discover. By fifth, she was writing computer programs to help teach 
first-graders to read. 
</P>
<P>
 She is spending this summer as a peer coach in the SURF program, which 
attracts students from all over the country -- most of them enrolled at 
Caltech. Students submit project proposals, which are reviewed by a faculty 
committee. The 219 students chosen, ranging from humanities and social science 
majors to Jet Propulsion Laboratory students, receive stipends and funding for 
the 10-week program. It's an opportunity to work among people who share their 
passion for the mysteries and discoveries of research. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the 10 weeks, they must make presentations in competition and be 
able to communicate not only with peers and judges, but with those with little 
or different scientific backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Because students come from diverse fields, biology majors must make their work 
understandable to those studying chemistry or engineering, political science or 
economics. The process reflects researchers' attempts to make their work more 
accessible to the general public. No simple task. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have developed a language that allows us to speak to each other in 
shorthand," says Caltech Vice Provost David Goodstein, a physics professor. "In 
the end, however, it allows scientists to only communicate with other 
scientists, and even we don't always understand each other. We have to be able 
to undo that." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffersonian principles of democracy in an increasingly technical society 
require scientific literacy, Goodstein says.  
</P>
<P>
 The general public must be able to comprehend technical information not only 
to have a better understanding of the universe but also to play an active, 
responsible role in government, he says. "You really wonder if people are well 
enough educated to make those decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary," Anderson says of the public's limited understanding. "Science is 
an intricate part of people's lives. The fact that when you stand up, you're on 
the ground, that's science, you know, gravity." 
</P>
<P>
 There has to be a halfway point, she says. Scientists must make their world 
understandable to people who lack scientific backgrounds. But we -- the lacking 
-- must make an effort to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 As Anderson continues to explain DNA through her drawings of ladders, it 
becomes apparent that somewhere down the road she is hoping to find information 
useful in the search for a cancer cure. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's work involves adhering a rhodium complex to DNA. When the complex 
is exposed to ultraviolet light, it cuts the DNA. She will attempt to design 
the complex to bind to a specific sequence of DNA present only in cancer cells. 
The research also involves other complexes that do not require ultraviolet 
light, a critical step in being able to apply the concept to the human body. 
</P>
<P>
 The excitement shows in her voice. She would like to share it with others, but 
many people, she says, view scientists the same way they view science -- from a 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people ask what school I go to and I tell them I'm studying chemistry at 
Caltech, I can kill a conversation just like that," she says. "I hate that." 
</P>
<P>

 Adele Shakal won second-place in last year's SURF presentation competition. 
The title of her project was "X-ray Crystal Structures of Hyperthermophilic 
Proteins." Her subtitle was "Growing a Forest to See a Tree." 
</P>
<P>
 A junior geology major at Caltech and SURF peer coach, Shakal, 21, is 
considering the field of technical communications, helping narrow the distance 
between science and the public. 
</P>
<P>
 At the National Conference on Undergraduate Research at Western Michigan 
University in Kalamazoo last year, her parents drove up from Greenwood, Ind., 
to hear her speak. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom came up to me afterward and gave me a big hug and said, 'I understood 
what you were talking about,' and that was very exciting for both of us, 
because bridging the gap between technical research and general understanding 
is sometimes difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a gap Shakal knows well. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up, she found it difficult to share her excitement for science with 
friends. It was something she kept to herself like a horrible secret. Rather 
than go into a lot of detail about the science camps she attended in the 
summers, she would simply tell friends she was "going to camp." 
</P>
<P>
 "They assumed I was going to live in the woods for two weeks. I had the 
feeling it would be misunderstood, and socially it was more comfortable not to 
tell people." 
</P>
<P>
 It has to do with adolescence and the "N-word." No one wants to be considered 
a nerd. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent summers doing the usual things, but I always knew that somewhere 
during the middle of summer, there would be these two or three magical weeks 
where I would be exposed to all these new ideas and all these other people who 
thought the way I did, and that was a breath of fresh air. . . . Finding a 
niche is a rather important feeling for a kid growing up." 
</P>
<P>
 Caltech is a comfortable setting for her, she says. Here, she has found a 
world of possibilities, and she has felt not only the thrill of discovery but 
the thrill of sharing discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 And that is what fuels much of science. 
</P>

<P>
 Roshan Kumar, a senior majoring in chemistry and biology at Caltech, is 
working on a project titled, "Synthesis and Transport of Cell-Specific Imaging 
Agents for MRI Using Transferrin-Polylysine-DNA Conjugates." 
</P>
<P>
 The analogy he uses to describe his work involves a terrorist camp somewhere 
in a city. Current cancer treatments, he explains, are sort of like taking out 
the whole city to make sure the terrorist camp is taken out. In the process of 
killing cancer cells, innocent, non-cancer cells also are destroyed. The 
purpose of his project is to find a way to attack only the bad guys. 
</P>
<P>
 Undergraduates find themselves caught between two worlds. To be accepted in 
their fields of study, which are very competitive, they must learn the 
language. And as they use the language, it becomes one more thing that makes 
them different, which in their recent past may have been a difficult aspect of 
growing up. 
</P>
<P>
 "In general, the vocabulary just obscures things," Kumar says. "The words are 
there in English to make it understandable. When you just start out in the 
field, you don't know the vocabulary, but once you learn it, you become so 
familiar with it that it's sort of a trap. It becomes your language even though 
you could explain things a lot simpler and a lot of times better without the 
jargon." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Ann Smith, a communication consultant, instructs the SURF peer coaches on 
how to help participants prepare their oral presentations. She stresses 
simplicity. The ability to simplify complex information is indication the 
student understands the subject matter, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult and sometimes we forget how specialized the projects are. 
In some cases, there may only be two or three people in the world doing similar 
research." 
</P>
<P>
 You can simplify, but you can't stuff science down people's throats. There 
are, however, ways of making it inviting. The Simpson trial likely will include 
a lesson for us in DNA, which is complicated enough without lawyers being 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not the lawyers or the expert witnesses who will decide Simpson's 
fate. That responsibility rests with the jury, people like us, whose 
backgrounds in science may extend little beyond the horrible things we did to 
those frogs a long time ago.

COMMITMENTS; WHO NEEDS A RING? MANY MIDDLE-AGED COUPLES SAY THEY DON'T.

 "I was once introduced as the woman he sleeps with," Silvia, 49, of Topanga 
said of her relationship with the man she has lived with for six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Silvia, a novelist raised in Peru, said maridos -- a Spanish word she defines 
as a couple who have a committed relationship but aren't necessarily married -- 
best describes her relationship with the 63-year-old university professor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marriage is for having children. When you're in another stage of life, 
marriage doesn't seem relevant," said Silvia, who was married once and has two 
grown daughters. She asked that her last name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
 Added her marido : "The relationship quality is shaped less by public ritual 
or legal binds. What touches us is the quality of day-to-day living." 
</P>
<P>
 They are one of about 500,000 couples in California who live together without 
benefit of marriage, according to 1990 Census data. Unlike younger couples 
testing a relationship or senior citizens trying to retain larger retirement 
benefits, many middle-age couples are motivated by fear or denial, experts say. 
They are afraid of repeating the pain of a past, failed marriage or hope to set 
the clock back by assuming a younger lifestyle, the experts add. 
</P>
<P>
 While about half of those cohabitants in their late 40s to early 60s 
eventually marry, those who don't face potentially troubling legal 
ramifications. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, domestic partners cannot visit their loved one in hospital 
intensive care units nor speak for the patient regarding resuscitation 
instructions or organ donations. Also, funeral homes will release a body only 
to a spouse or blood relative. 
</P>
<P>
 Silvia, who was not aware of these facts, called it absurd, and added: "We'll 
cross that bridge if we come to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see us being separated except by death," she said. "Still, I don't 
intend to marry him. . . . We've joked about marrying, but when we really think 
about it, neither one wants to get married. I've come to the point where I 
don't feel marriage means anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there are options short of marriage. An unmarried couple can, with an 
attorney, execute a "durable power of attorney for health care." This will 
enable the designated person to make specified health care decisions in case 
the individual is unable to. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can give instructions for all kinds of things to happen if you only take 
the time," said Jack Rameson, an attorney with Rehwald, Rameson, Lewis and 
Glasner in Woodland Hills, who specializes in probate, trust and estate 
planning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who is living together has got to sit down and document what their 
wishes are" through any number of general or specific powers of attorney, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A durable power of attorney for health care can be executed with a lawyer for 
$25 to $100, depending on how complicated it is, said Rameson, adding that 
forms from the California Medical Assn. can be obtained for substantially less. 
Many hospitals give them out free. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes denial keeps couples from putting their wishes in writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly as we get older, the likelihood of physical illness increases. 
These are issues of greater and greater importance. Basically, (these couples) 
are not looking at it," said Dr. Gary Small, a geriatric psychiatrist and 
associate professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at the UCLA School 
of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Living in sin after 50 is a way of denying the reality of aging," Small 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Seen in another light, these middle-age couples may feel invigorated because 
they've adopted a lifestyle associated with youth, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it is because young people made living together so fashionable in the 
'60s that it is more acceptable for middle-age people to do it now. For many, 
living together feels free and independent -- not governed by society's rules, 
Silvia and her mate said. 
</P>
<P>
 The couples interviewed said they got few if any snickers or dirty looks from 
friends, parents or children. One couple said they each had a grown child who 
was living with someone, so those children were in no position to criticize. 
Silvia said her married, 24-year-old daughter took a dim view of living 
together on moral grounds, although it didn't "interfere with (their) 
relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say mature couples are often in a good position to evaluate their best 
living situation. Psychologists and sociologists point to the fact that living 
with someone offers a support system with companionship and affection that 
improves the quality of a middle-age person's life. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, living together is the choice because memories of nasty divorces and 
court battles are still fresh, experts and couples say. 
</P>
<P>
 "One way to avoid dealing with those issues of intimacy is to not commit the 
way you would if you got married," Small said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene McGregor, 52, of Bakersfield said he hasn't "had luck with committed 
relationships." So after three divorces, McGregor, a maintenance worker with 
Kern County's Park and Recreation department, has opted to live with Pat 
Shanley, 60, a medical office manager. 
</P>
<P>
 They share interests such as Western dancing and traveling, but both are 
hesitant to marry -- having each been down the aisle three times. McGregor's 
first two marriages lasted 1 1/2 years and six months respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 When things get rough, McGregor said he's ready to move on. He said he's found 
that efforts to save a dying relationship usually fail. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanley agreed that it's easier to give up when you're not wearing a ring. But 
for her, a marital commitment would mean trying everything to save the 
relationship. "He wants it to be bliss all the time. Commitment is far from his 
mind. . . . Commitment is less interesting to me too." 
</P>
<P>
 They say they've talked about tying the knot but are undecided. For now, they 
say, things are good. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Marriage therapist Lois Gordon said many couples who move in together 
initially leave it "purposefully vague" whether they will later exchange vows. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most couples when they move in expect to stay together the rest of their 
lives, but they are not sure whether or not it's important to be married," said 
Gordon, who has offices in Santa Monica and Encino. Some couples come to her to 
resolve the conflict of whether to marry. 
</P>
<P>
 Often before that question can be answered, remembrances of broken hearts and 
breakups have to be handled. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Rosen, 48, and Theresa Ferrer-Brechner, 52, had to face the negative 
perceptions of marriage that were seeping into their relationship. They had 
lived together for more than five years and Rosen wanted to make it official. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so afraid it would be a repetition of previous experiences. I was so 
scared," said Ferrer-Brechner, who is twice divorced and the mother of two 
grown daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they enjoyed being together, the decision for Rosen to move into 
Ferrer-Brechner's Los Angeles home was easy. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to marry was not. Ferrer-Brechner, a physician and UCLA 
professor, was raised in the Philippines and taught from an early age to marry 
a fellow physician -- which she did twice. Rosen, who was in the manufacturing, 
management and sales end of the garment industry, did not fit her idea of who 
she thought she should marry. Then there was the issue of her younger daughter, 
who hoped Ferrer-Brechner would reconcile with her second husband. 
</P>
<P>
 In the middle of these struggles, Ferrer-Brechner found an opportunity in the 
San Joaquin Valley. Rosen went, too, and they headed off to therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I accept him for who he is. It was probably the hardest thing I've done in my 
life," Ferrer-Brechner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of Ferrer-Brechner's daughters came to like Rosen and served as 
bridesmaids in the May wedding, which made their mother's day complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrer-Brechner said one thing that didn't push her down the aisle was her 
Catholic faith, which she said frowns on living together unmarried. 
</P>
<P>
 "(God) understands what happens in real life. . . . I don't feel any remorse 
or guilt even when Steven and I were living together."

THE LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAULA LYNN PARKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here are experts' views on some of the financial and legal implications of 
living together. The Pros 
</P>
<P>
 * "Marriage penalty": Two individuals who each earn $40,000 a year pay $1,321 
less in federal tax than a married couple earning a combined $80,000 and filing 
jointly, said Albert Golbert, an attorney in Los Angeles with Golbert, Kimmal 
and Weiner who specializes in taxation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Social Security: Benefits are higher for two individuals than for a married 
couple. The Cons 
</P>
<P>
 * Assets: If an unmarried couple breaks up, California's community property 
laws do not apply to the splitting of assets. One partner could end up with 
nothing, yet have contributed half, said Joan Patsy Ostroy, an attorney in West 
Los Angeles who specializes in family law. So any assets the couple buys 
together should have both names on the title. 
</P>
<P>
 * Support: A partner is entitled to support after a breakup only if such an 
agreement is put in writing. "It's hard to prove oral agreements," Ostroy said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Estate taxes: A married couple is entitled to make greater use of estate- 
and gift-tax exemptions than unmarried partners. When a husband or wife dies, 
the surviving spouse can inherit his or her half of the estate tax-free. The 
widow or widower can then pass on $1.2 million tax-free to children or other 
beneficiaries. A survivor in a live-in relationship does not automatically 
receive a tax-free inheritance and is entitled to only the standard $600,000 
estate-tax exemption, half that afforded a widow or widower. 
</P>
<P>
 * Social Security: An unmarried person whose domestic partner dies continues 
to collect only his or her own benefits. A widowed recipient collects a larger 
amount. PAULA LYNN PARKS

HOWARD ROSENBERG: TELEVISION; THE MOST PERFECT TV FAMILY OF THEM ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fall television season has some real nice shows about families. Yet those 
of us who regularly watch daytime talk shows are cognizant of what's missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere in prime time -- even those unconventional Fox sitcoms "Married . . . 
With Children" and "The Simpsons" don't qualify -- is there a series about 
typical families, the kind that we see graciously sharing their lives with us 
day after day on these talk shows that reflect the real America. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, the networks have to be led by leash to the promised land of 
artistic creativity. Here for their perusal is a full season outline for "The 
Flaws," a sitcom about a real family whose problems all of us can relate to. 
</P>
<P>
 The four Flaws are Mom, 29; Dad, 63; Bro, 13, and Sis, 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Episode 1: The whole family has a laugh when Sis repeatedly gets on Mom for 
being too fat, and Mom ridicules Sis for being flat-chested. The episode ends 
hilariously with Mom getting the shrieking Sis in a headlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Episode 2: Believing that some subjects are best left to parents, Mom and Dad 
are outraged to learn some of the things their kids are being taught at school. 
"How many times I gotta tell you?" Mom lectures Sis. "It's ain't , not isn't ." 
</P>
<P>
 Episode 3: Sis reminds Bro that Montel Williams has urged kids with dumb 
parents to call his show's 800 number. What does she have in mind? The 
uproarious last scene has Sis and Bro disclosing to Williams on national 
television that Mom and Dad are illiterate. Naturally, Mom is watching at home. 
"Them rascals," she laughs. "I was wondering where they was for the past two 
days." 
</P>
<P>
 Episode 4: It turns out that Mom and Dad are swingers who have an open 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Episode 5: All of the Flaws are elated when Sis announces that she and her 
newest boyfriend, age 23, are contemplating living together. But then the Flaws 
find out he is a transvestite. "Well," quips Dad about about Sis' boyfriend, 
"at least this one ain't married." 
</P>
<P>
 Episode 6: After discovering Mom's porno magazines, Dad asks Ann Landers for 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Episode 7: This time Sis has another new boyfriend, and he's only 12. But 
wouldn't you know the fur flies when she walks in on Mom making out with him in 
the kitchen? 
</P>
<P>
 Episode 8: Dad beats up Mom. "What am I, a punching bag?" quips Mom. "I love 
your sense of humor," Dad says, landing a solid uppercut to the jaw. "Then stop 
knocking me senseless," Mom laughs on her way down. 
</P>
<P>
 Episode 9: Dad and Mom are shocked and angered to learn that Bro has become a 
strutting neo-Nazi. "We try to be good role models, but it don't do no good," 
Mom cracks. After a rip-roaringly funny family blowout, there's a compromise on 
Bro's SS uniform. Dad tells him: "You can wear it on Halloween." 
</P>
<P>
 Episode 10: Sis derides Mom for wearing plunging necklines and miniskirts. Mom 
tells Sis to shut up and mind her own business. The episode ends with a bang, 
as Sis and Mom settle their differences by wrestling on the floor and pulling 
each other's hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Episode 11: Sis and Bro are watching "Ricki Lake" at home when Mom reveals to 
Dad on national television that she has been sleeping with his best friend for 
years. "What are you feeling now?" Lake asks the sobbing Dad. 
</P>
<P>
 "That two-timer," Sis laughs about Mom's lover. "Hell will freeze over before 
I let him sleep with me again." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ditto for me," chirps Bro as the picture freezes and the credits begin to 
roll. 
</P>
<P>
 Episode 12: Mom loses her head and tries to murder Dad. 
</P>
<P>
 Episode 13: Mom and Dad are watching at home when Sis and Bro tell Jenny Jones 
on national television that they are being sexually molested by their parents. 
"Oh, no, are we in for it now," Mom laughs. "Are they in for it now," Dad 
quips, slapping his knees. "What are you feeling now?" Jones asks Sis and Bro. 
</P>
<P>
 Episode 14: Sis and Bro notice that Dad is becoming an alcoholic. 
</P>
<P>
 Episode 15: Mom reveals that she's a shopaholic. 
</P>
<P>
 Episode 16: Bro is treated for drug addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Episode 17: Sis is arrested for prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Episode 18: Mom announces that she is moving out to live with Sis' 12-year-old 
boyfriend, then changes her mind when he reveals he's only 11. "I ain't robbing 
no cradle," she tells a relieved Dad, who joins her in a big laugh.

BRAZIL GIVES COBHAM NEW BEAT AND OUTLOOK; MUSIC: THE DRUMMER, WHO PLAYS THE 
COACH HOUSE ON TUESDAY, FOUND INSPIRATION FOR NEW ALBUM WHILE DOING UNICEF 
PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 When Billy Cobham takes the stage at the Coach House Tuesday with Stanley 
Clarke, Larry Carlton, Brian Simpson and Najee in the Jazz Explosion Superband, 
his mind surely will be on his performance, but his heart well may be in 
Santos, Brazil, with Ellison, Edison and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the more influential musicians of his generation, the 50-year-old 
drummer spent five months of last year working in the Brazilian town for a 
UNICEF-sponsored project designed to give homeless children basic care and hope 
for a future. As if in return, he found the inspiration for his new 
Evidence-label release "The Traveler," a Brazilian-flavored outing that 
reflects his experiences working with the youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids all had single nicknames, strangely enough, in English," he said 
last week on the phone from New York between Superband concerts. "Ellison was 
the biggest, a very cynical 18-year old, though he still wasn't a total lost 
cause. Edison really wanted to go to school and make something of himself. But 
it was Washington who really stirred up the emotion in me. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I met him he was smoking this giant spliff. At 11, he was 
already older than most of us in terms of experience. There was talk that he 
may have committed murder. He'd really been around. And he loved rap." 
</P>
<P>
 Cobham got involved with the fledgling program after, as he puts it, "I opened 
my big mouth" during a dinner party in Rome that included some Europeans with 
ties to UNICEF. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the course of conversation about helping children, I jumped in and said 
what you people ought to do is give these kids some direction, put some artist 
in there with the kids and give them a positive direction to emulate. That was 
November of '92. Later, they called to see if I wanted to get involved. By 
January, I was in Brazil." 
</P>
<P>
 He had direct contact with about a dozen children ranging in age from 6 to 18. 
Besides providing food and medical care, the program sought to give them skills 
to grow on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without any knowledge of Portuguese, I found it was uncannily easy to use 
music as a point of interest in communication," Cobham said. "We tried to bring 
in musicians from the surrounding areas who they knew, to bring an air of 
respectability to the program. We were actually able to form a concert group, 
and put on one concert at the town hall that was very successful." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to performing, Cobham taught the children a craft that could 
provide a foundation for their lives: how to repair instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids are always concentrating on how they're going to survive the next 
30 seconds," he said. "How would it be if they had some skills, could earn some 
money? It would open up a whole wide world for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he thinks the most valuable aspect of the program was the chance it 
gave the children to express themselves. "Washington took over the mike (at the 
concert) and just spilled his guts to the kind of rhythm that Arrested 
Development might play. He rapped just about what had happened to him the night 
before. But it was poetry and people were blown away." 
</P>
<P>
 During those five months, Cobham found himself coming up with material for 
"The Traveler." "I'd say 90% of the tunes were written in Brazil. They would 
come into my head while I was working and I'd sing them into a dictation 
machine. Later, I sat down at the piano and put it all together. I'll always be 
indebted to the people of Santos for that inspiration." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The album's title is apt for someone born in Panama, raised in New York and 
living now in Switzerland. Cobham's pinpoint, well-muscled sound was at the 
forefront of a new musical direction that was spawned in the late '60s and that 
resulted in the genre now loosely defined as "fusion." 
</P>
<P>
 After a stint with jazz-funk composer-pianist Horace Silver, Cobham joined the 
ground-breaking though short-lived crossover band Dreams in 1969. He played on 
Miles Davis' landmark "Bitches Brew" and went on to record a number of other 
experimental electric sessions with the revered innovator. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was his work with John McLaughlin's Mahvishnu Orchestra that thrust him 
into the spotlight. His ambitious, split-hair timekeeping, matched against 
guitarist McLaughlin's machine-gun attack, won over a generation of listeners 
looking for more depth and musical proficiency than was being offered by that 
day's crop of rockers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobham went on to record a number of his own albums, beginning with the 
critically acclaimed "Spectrum" in 1973 (recently re-released on CD). He says 
he is both flattered and chagrined to hear samples from "Spectrum" being used 
on other musicians' recordings, most notably on bassist Bill Laswell's latest, 
on which an entire number is built from a Cobham song called "Red Barron." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonderful piece," Cobham said, "but I don't like the fact that I 
wasn't given credit or acknowledgment, let alone payment. It's not fair. They 
owe me an explanation." 
</P>
<P>
 He finds the current state of the fusion movement to be more focused than the 
expansive explorations of 20 years ago. "The musical direction has been 
narrowed; only small portions (from the early days) are being used and 
amplified. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's because of the way many young musicians view the music and what they're 
putting together. They don't need that complicated Miles alternative or the 
thing that Mahvishnu had. They need to bring it right into your face, like with 
the rap thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jazz Explosion Superband is an ensemble of fellow fusion pioneers who have 
found common ground playing each other's music. Their tour last year resulted 
in the Epic release "Live At the Greek" which includes Cobham's seriously 
percussive "Stratus" from "Spectrum." 
</P>
<P>
 Cobham said that despite some initial ego problems, the group has come 
together very well. He has only polite words for his fellow members: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Stanley Clarke: "We're really getting to know each other, finally, after 
thinking we already did. This is a very good experience for us, to perform 
together over an extended period of time (last year), go away, and then come 
back together again. Our relationship started out a little lumpy and stiff 
because we played in different environments, but we really understand each 
other now." 
</P>
<P>
 On Larry Carlton: "I've only known Larry since 1992 but I've always admired 
his work. He's very congenial, very easygoing and a wonderful guitarist." 
</P>
<P>
 On Najee: "As far as I'm concerned, he's the best-kept secret in woodwinds. He 
doesn't just play tenor and alto but serious soprano and flute too. Every night 
with him is a joy." 
</P>
<P>
 And on Brian Simpson, who has replaced Deron Johnson on keyboards: "He's 
really walked into a difficult situation. He came in a day and a half before 
the gig (to audition) and just knocked our socks off. He's a very supportive 
keyboard player." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Cobham said, the children of Santos are always in the back of his mind. 
His return to Brazil hinges on the outcome of this year's Brazilian 
presidential election and approval of UNICEF funding. "I'm waiting for 
permission. But the first chance I have, I'll be there. I don't want to force 
myself; I have nothing politically to prove. But I do have a lot to gain." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Jazz Explosion Superband with Billy Cobham, Stanley Clarke, Larry 
Carlton, Brian Simpson and Najee plays Tuesday at 7 and 9:30 p.m. at the Coach 
House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. $25. (714) 496-8930.

ZORN'S 'GARDEN' SPROUTS DISCONTENT; JAZZ: ASIAN AMERICAN GROUPS PROTEST HIS USE 
OF S&M IMAGES ON HIS CD AND ACCUSE HIM OF DENIGRATING WOMEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For avant-garde musician John Zorn, the naked Japanese women in S&M bondage 
that adorn his "Torture Garden" CD are an aesthetic statement that cannot be 
separated from the discordant jazz he creates. 
</P>
<P>
 For many in the Asian American community, they are flat-out pornography. 
Earlier this year, several national groups called on Zorn to withdraw two of 
his CDs from distribution, condemning the covers for portraying Asian women in 
a stereotypical and demeaning fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy is gathering steam: Earlier this summer, Zorn lost a gig in 
New York and a San Francisco radio station withdrew sponsorship of a Zorn 
concert after Asian Americans complained. 
</P>
<P>
 "If these are his personal proclivities, I have no objection to that, but it 
becomes a public act when he disperses these images into the marketplace and 
he's certainly accountable for them and for having them critiqued," said 
Richard Oyama, a scholar and poet who is active in the San Francisco-based 
artist group, Godzilla West. 
</P>
<P>
 Asian Americans also object to a Zorn CD called "Naked City," which includes 
images and text referring to a historic form of Chinese capital punishment in 
which a living person's body is dismembered. A written explanation in Japanese 
says the CD is dedicated to this theme. 
</P>
<P>
 Zorn, 40, a New York-based saxophonist who has lived in Japan for much of the 
past decade and speaks fluent Japanese, says he is shocked by the vehemence of 
the attacks. He says the images were not chosen lightly but reflect his own 
interest and explorations into the dark side of human experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not an insensitive person," Zorn said in a telephone interview. "I 
understand the concerns of the Asian American community. I don't want to make 
it more difficult for them." 
</P>
<P>
 The artist says that after the complaints started, he asked his Japanese 
record label to stop importing the CDs on a temporary basis. In the meantime, 
he has offered to wrap the offending CDs in plain covers or add a disclaimer 
explaining that the graphic images "have been used for their transgressive 
quality, illustrative of those areas of human experience hidden in the gaps 
between pain and pleasure, life and death, horror and ecstasy. They are not and 
were never intended to denigrate or insult any particular person or groups of 
persons." 
</P>
<P>
 But Asian American groups say that's not enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like we can just slap a Band-Aid on it and say, 'Fine,' " says 
Sherwin Yoon, a spokesman for the New York-based Committee Against Anti-Asian 
Violence. "We appreciate the steps he has taken, but we were hoping to work 
closer with him to bring this greater issue to light. There needs to be a lot 
more discussion about misrepresentation of Asians in the media and the art 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 An exasperated Zorn says he isn't willing to go any further. 
</P>
<P>
 Quirky and esoteric, Zorn is a leading figure in New York's experimental art 
scene, where he focuses on making music solo, with collaborators or with his 
longtime band Naked City. Zorn is resolutely unconcerned about reaching a mass 
market and has a small but influential following. Few of his 30 or so 
recordings have sold more than 10,000 copies.  
</P>
<P>
 Zorn says he draws inspiration from French writer Georges Battaille, whose 
literature dealt with erotic and taboo themes, the macabre theater of Grand 
Guignol and the often-shocking photographs of Joel-Peter Witkin -- who takes 
viewers into a nightmarish world of sexual deviance, cadavers and circus 
freaks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His tastes are omnivorous and eclectic. His recordings have included a tribute 
to the music of film composer Ennio Morricone and avant-garde jazz saxophonist 
Ornette Coleman. For his next Naked City project, Zorn is putting a Coleman 
spin on traditional Jewish klezmer music, friends say. 
</P>
<P>
 Zorn says he chooses the images on his CDs carefully to complement the music. 
Sometimes the images even inspire the music. The controversial covers -- which 
Zorn says were released without problem in Japan -- are designed in 
collaboration with Tomoko Tanaka, a female graphic artist in Japan. According 
to Zorn, both the music and art come out of deep personal experience mixed with 
an outsider aesthetic.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I lived in Japan, I got involved in the S&M torture scene," Zorn says. 
"I lived those images. If someone criticizes me, they're not looking at the 
scope of my work, as an artist who deals with these themes in a consistent way. 
I've used Caucasians in violent situations too." 
</P>
<P>
 Zorn's friends and supporters say the artist is a moral person who is being 
used as a scapegoat to further a political agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are unfairly assuming that he's exploiting and taking advantage of 
these photos . . . and that's not true," says Michael Dorf, owner of the 
Knitting Factory, a New York-based performance space and record label that 
specializes in avant-garde music. 
</P>
<P>
 "John has artistic integrity. He's got a huge collection of art that has to do 
with this theme. He's done research on it. He's immersed and obsessed with 
Asian culture. He's not doing this without a consciousness about what it means 
for women and Asian women and the history of the Japanese exploiting other 
Asian countries." 
</P>
<P>
 Battles over artistic freedom in music-related imagery are nothing new. Past 
furors include a mid-1970s flap over an ad for the Rolling Stones' "Black and 
Blue" album that featured a bruised, tied-up woman. Geffen Records reissued a 
Guns N' Roses CD after complaints about the initial "Appetite for Destruction" 
cover, which reproduced a Robert Williams painting of a robot raping a woman. 
Last year, women's groups lodged protests against rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg, 
saying an eight-panel cartoon on the "Doggystyle" CD degraded women. 
</P>
<P>
 But the controversy defies easy solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "This raised a lot of questions for me," confesses Ginny Z. Berson, program 
director at KPFA, Berkeley's Pacifica radio station whose phone lines were 
flooded with angry callers, many of them Asian American, after the station 
broadcast a Zorn concert in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the uproar, KPFA withdrew sponsorship of a concert by Zorn planned 
for San Francisco's Great American Music Hall. Berson also instructed a DJ to 
discuss the controversy on the air before playing Zorn's music and put together 
a talk show program on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mission is to promote understanding, the building of bridges between 
people of different cultures and groups . . . and artwork that depicts torture 
of Asian women does not promote that," Berson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But what does John Zorn playing his sax have to do with that?" she added 
rhetorically. "And what about Miles Davis' misogyny? Does that mean we have to 
discuss his attitudes toward women each time we play his music?" 
</P>
<P>
 Zorn's invitation to play at the New York Museum of Natural History's 125th 
anniversary celebration in June was rescinded after Asian Americans there 
complained, according to the artist and Dorf, who helped broker the concert. A 
spokeswoman for the museum said a contract was never signed, but conceded there 
had been discussions with Zorn and that he was dropped because of complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Zorn says he's sorry about the lost gigs but that he's not about to 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "As an artist you can't please everyone," Zorn says. "If I took all their 
criticism to heart I'd never create anything. I don't want to make it harder 
for Asians in this country; I'm on their side. But frankly, I don't think my 
records are doing that."

CHAPMAN TRIES TO REIGNITE GRIDIRON SPIRIT; SPORTS: WILL STUDENTS RALLY BEHIND 
THE O.C. UNIVERSITY'S FIRST FOOTBALL TEAM SINCE THE 1930S? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last time the Chapman University Panthers football team ran out onto a 
field, Franklin D. Roosevelt had just been elected and the New Deal promised 
relief to a nation mired in the Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty-two years later, players will once again don helmets and pads and march 
onto the gridiron this September. This time, the team will play home games in 
Orange -- not Los Angeles -- and will no longer carry its old name of 
California Christian. 
</P>
<P>
 Boosters are quick to mention that the Chapman Panthers will become the only 
NCAA football squad in Orange County when they battle the Whittier College 
Fighting Poets on Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few small problems, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Most team members haven't met each other yet. A recently ordered scoreboard 
remains to be installed. And someone's going to have to tutor the university 
president on the intricacies of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may have to read a rule book," President James Doti said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bigger question at this school of about 2,900 students -- few of whom 
are aware of the school's long-lost football heritage -- is whether Chapman 
students will rally behind the team and gain school spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe part of it is having a fight song, like USC's "Fight On" or the 
University of Michigan's "Hail to the Victors." 
</P>
<P>
 "Do we have a school fight song?" Athletic Director David Currey asked 
himself. "We don't even have a school fight." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so maybe it's going to be harder than they thought. But team supporters 
said they're ready to make Chapman's first football season in Division III the 
NCAA small-college category -- a memorable one by involving 100 new football 
players and the rest of the student body in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's exciting to be a part of history," said head coach Ken Visser. "Maybe 
this isn't the most significant thing in history, but for a football player, 
it's pretty exciting to be a part of something that hasn't existed in 62 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 Sports psychologists and experts said there are several factors that can rally 
students and alumni behind a team and develop school spirit: image, marketing, 
tradition and, of course, winning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apathy is a function of poor performance," explained Dr. Robert Schleser, 
director of the Center for Sport Performance Psychology in Chicago. "An 
institution with history and tradition can sustain losing better than a new 
program." 
</P>
<P>
 If the team doesn't win, some people think fans will quickly lose interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have clients who say, 'Yeah, I hear you got a football team,' and they 
smirk and laugh," said Jennifer Trammell, 23, a hairstylist and English student 
at Chapman. "They expect them to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Trammell said she plans to attend the games, which will be free to students 
and faculty. Tickets will cost the public $5. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a revenue sport -- it's a participation sport," said Currey, 
adding that it will cost the university about $200,000 to fund the team. None 
of the players will receive scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the way it was years and years ago," Currey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Creating nostalgia, sticking with the basics of a sport and starting tradition 
may be a part of boosting spirit, experts said. Part of that tradition revolves 
around football's role as a part of Americana and college life. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things that's distinctive about American colleges and universities 
is this notion of school spirit," said Mike Oriard, an English professor at 
Oregon State University who played football at Notre Dame and for the Kansas 
City Chiefs. "Here we think of college as a way of life for four years, an 
experience not just in curriculum but in athletics and its spinoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman administrators think having the football players tap the head of a 
donated $8,000 bronze panther sculpture on campus before each Saturday game 
might start a tradition. At some other colleges, players tap signs before games 
or pray together in special alcoves. 
</P>
<P>
 Chants, events such as homecoming and rituals such as Florida State 
University's "Tomahawk Chop" are mentioned as a few of the customs that help 
fans identify themselves with a team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Football gives people a sense of pride, a sense of belonging," said Schleser, 
a psychology professor at the Illinois Institute of Technology. "Teams become 
an extension of ourselves and bring us together as a group." 
</P>
<P>
 Marketing can promote and reflect how students and alumni rally behind a team. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman bookstore manager James Clement said the store began stocking 
football-themed shirts in late spring, with lackluster sales. They also have 
big, red Chapman flags available, "but you don't find too many people with 
flagpoles," Clement said. 
</P>
<P>
 He expects sales to pick up when new sweat shirts and other items arrive in 
the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The spirit's already here," Clement said. "Having a football team's really 
going to boost it." 
</P>
<P>
 Trammell believes administrators need to promote the team more, because she 
has not heard enough about it at school. A member of the Alpha Phi sorority, 
she plans to be a part of any spirit activities that form around the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they really need to rally school spirit," said Trammell, of Anaheim 
Hills. "It's a private school and really well-known, but not for sports." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, Currey, the athletic director, had a unique Chapman 
football item on his desk that may whip up some spirit during the countdown to 
the opening day. 
</P>
<P>
 A black plastic digital watch marked with a red "C" -- destined to go to 
selected people in the Chapman community -- lay in its box, but the words on 
its face were visible: 33 days till Panther football . 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Topor, a higher education marketing consultant, said excitement about a 
college can easily be packaged. 
</P>
<P>
 "This idea of spirit has monetary value, just as a product may have inherent 
value in terms of public visibility," Topor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Visser, Chapman's new coach, thinks location will help the team. "We're in 
Orange County, and Orange County loves football," Visser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's Doti, Chapman's president and an economist, who came up with the 
idea to revive the football team even though the two schools he attended -- the 
University of Chicago and the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle -- did 
not have football teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Doti and other administrators moved the school's athletics program from 
Division II, where its teams faced larger schools, to Division III in 1992 -- 
much to the dismay of some in the athletic department. That meant no more 
scholarships, but it also meant that two new men's sports and five new women's 
sports could be added because the department had more money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we're the only game in town," Doti said. Neither UC Irvine nor Cal State 
Fullerton, the two largest Orange County universities, have intercollegiate 
football programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "And with the possibility of the Rams leaving, people are enthusiastic," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton physical education professor Kenneth Ravizza said he 
doubts Chapman will be able to rally large numbers of students to support its 
team. Cal State Fullerton disbanded its Division I football team in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Division III schools, their quality of entertainment isn't good," 
Ravizza said. "But they're not there to entertain the fans, they're there to 
provide opportunity for a student athlete." 
</P>
<P>
 One sports historian called Division III football closer to the "pristine 
ideal" of the sport. Currey agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to bring back the days when you studied, and you played for fun," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doti said alumni and others are already asking him about the team. He said 
listeners regularly approach him to ask questions after his speeches on 
economics but "now sometimes people walk up and instead of asking about 
inflation, they say, 'Are you really going to have a good team?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Banners soon to be strung throughout campus and in the streets of downtown 
Orange will remind the community of the first big home game against Claremont 
College Sept. 24, said Chapman spokeswoman Ruth Wardwell. 
</P>
<P>
 In a nostalgic opening to the game, Ernie Chapman, 84, reportedly the last 
remaining living player from the days of 1930s Chapman football, will handle 
the coin toss that determines which team kicks off first. He is the son of 
university founder Charles C. Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
 "How's that for tradition?" Wardwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans are also scheduled to get Chapman seat cushions. 
</P>
<P>
 Novelty likely will draw fans to the 3,000-seat stadium at first, officials 
said. But as a precaution, they have rented grandstands used at the Rose Parade 
and Long Beach Grand Prix in case projected attendance exceeds the stadium's 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Chapman moved to its current campus from Los Angeles in 1954, its 
stadium has never seen college football. 
</P>
<P>
 The field, set to be striped for the first time this morning by a grounds crew 
from Anaheim Stadium, is spare and undecorated, lacking the history that is 
part of great football tradition. There's nothing like "Touchdown Jesus," the 
mosaic that overlooks Notre Dame's stadium and is a symbol of that university's 
football fever. 
</P>
<P>
 On opening day, the horns and drumbeats of a loud university marching band 
will also be missing. A pep band of music students from Chapman is still in its 
formative stages, Currey said. The recent departure of the school's 
cheerleading adviser also has left officials unsure whether a pep squad can be 
ready for the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
 That's to be expected at the start of a small, new program, Currey said. It's 
also peripheral to his central goal: a good game of football. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't built a brand new stadium or fancy chair backs," Currey said. "We 
haven't got fancy brochures or season tickets or deluxe boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we do have is a college team that's going to run out onto the field and 
play."

HEAT SETS NO RECORDS, BUT SURF PACKS A PUNCH; WEATHER: SLIGHT RELIEF FROM 
TRIPLE-DIGIT TEMPERATURES IN SIGHT. HUNDREDS IN O.C. PLUCKED FROM RIP CURRENTS.

 Southern Californians continued to swelter in triple-digit temperatures in 
many places Sunday, but for the first time in three days the heat did not reach 
record levels, and meteorologists said there may be some relief -- though not 
much -- by midweek. 
</P>
<P>
 The suffocating heat drew tens of thousands of people to Orange County 
beaches, where the dangerous combination of large surf -- up to 10 and 12 feet 
at some beaches -- and heavy rip currents prompted hundreds of surf rescues, 
more than twice the usual number, lifeguards said. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Weather Service reported Sunday that temperatures reached 92 
degrees in Santa Ana, cooler than Saturday's 100-degree temperature, which tied 
the city's record high for that date. Temperatures also cooled slightly 
elsewhere, with 97 degrees at El Toro, 93 in Anaheim and 81 in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters said Orange County can expect temperatures to drop another two to 
five degrees over the next few days, with mostly clear skies through Tuesday 
except for patchy late-night and early morning clouds and fog at the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the slight respite Sunday provided little consolation to people who 
flocked to area beaches and kept lifeguards and rescue boats scrambling in the 
heavy surf and rip currents produced by a strong, south swell from tropical 
storms Ileana and John off Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 In Laguna Beach, where an estimated 35,000 people mobbed the beaches, 
lifeguards made about 350 rescues, 100 alone at Main Beach, according to Scott 
Diederich, Laguna Beach marine safety officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "From 9 a.m. to 10 a.m., we had 12 calls for medical aid for swimmers," 
Diederich said. "This was for a variety of neck and back injuries and fractured 
ribs." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50,000 people visited Huntington State Beach, one of the county's 
largest and most dangerous in terms of wave action, said Huntington State Beach 
Lifeguard Supervisor William Pfeiffer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Swimmers get in the water, and we really have a good side current of two to 
three knots pulling them into the rip and all that water is coming onshore and 
pushing out, pulling people out to sea," Pfeiffer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach lifeguards reported surf as high as 10 to 12 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 In Seal Beach, lifeguards took the special precaution of closing 100 yards of 
beach to swimmers immediately north of the city pier. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a very inexperienced swimming crowd today, and then large surf and 
heavy rip currents," said Andrew Seymour, Seal Beach director of parks, 
beaches, and recreation. "(The beach closure) was an unusual move, but it's a 
safety precaution. Our rescue boat was working hard today." 
</P>
<P>
 Seal Beach lifeguards had heavy duty on the city's west-end beaches near the 
San Gabriel River, but a professional volleyball match held on the sand was 
watched by thousands of spectators who stayed out of the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Seymour said some swimmers got towed by rip currents 200 yards from 
shore. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a long rescue caused by a combination of the outflow of the San Gabriel 
River plus the heavy surf," Seymour said. "Our rescue boat was kept very busy 
plucking people from the surf. We also had to rescue about seven to eight 
surfers. Two of them left their surfboards." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when you know you have a problem," he added, "when you see someone in 
the water swimming away from their surfboard." 
</P>
<P>
 Rough waves may force cancellation of a Dr. Pepper soft drink commercial 
scheduled to be filmed Tuesday, Seymour said. The commercial involves anchoring 
a barge several hundred feet from shore near 8th Street where fireworks would 
be detonated. 
</P>
<P>
 Meteorologist Curtis Brack of WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for 
The Times, said the two tropical storms are declining and the surf should 
"slack off in the next couple of days." 
</P>
<P>
 Brack said the heat wave was caused by a very strong high pressure area over 
California that was blocking cooler marine air from coming inland. But as the 
week progresses, "skies should be clearing out somewhat," he said, allowing 
temperatures to drop further. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, meteorologists were not ruling out a return to record highs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, I can't promise much relief yet," said Bruce Entwistle of the 
National Weather Service, predicting that temperatures "will bounce up and down 
a few degrees each day." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the weather may become more humid, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Bernardino County, more than 700 firefighters continued to fight two 
brush fires touched off by lightning Saturday. By midafternoon Sunday, the 
1,800-acre fires north of Lake Arrowhead were reported 50% under control, with 
no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now we are looking at the real hot weather and more thunderstorms 
coming," said Tom Sensintaff, a spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service, which 
was coordinating firefighting efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 A Hesperia family was hospitalized after they were struck by lightning under a 
tree during a storm at Hesperia Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighter Daren Brown said the lightning struck Leona Ellis, who was holding 
her 2 1/2-year-old daughter. "It ran through her, the baby and all the people 
who were around there," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis, the child and the baby's 55-year-old grandmother were in stable 
condition at San Bernardino County Medical Center on Sunday. Another daughter, 
two sons and another boy complained of a tingling feeling or loss of sensation 
and were hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety officials advise against seeking shelter under trees during 
thunderstorms. 
</P>
<P>
 The hottest spots in Southern California on Sunday included Monrovia and 
Montebello, with highs of 103 degrees, Pasadena at 102 and San Bernardino, 
where the temperature reached 100 at the 3 p.m. measuring time. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Edison reported that in Orange County, about 1,100 
customers experienced weekend service interruptions lasting from four hours to 
as long as 20 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Chriss Brown, an Edison spokesman, said that work crews had been working since 
Friday repairing 110 failed transformers. Summer Heat Tips 
</P>
<P>
 The American Red Cross offers the following tips to coping the effects of 
summer heat: 
</P>
<P>
 * Slow down and avoid strenuous outdoor activities 
</P>
<P>
 * Stay indoors as much as possible 
</P>
<P>
 * Wear lightweight, light-colored clothing 
</P>
<P>
 * Drink plenty of water 
</P>
<P>
 * Eat small meals throughout the day 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid foods high in protein, which increases metabolic heat 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid alcoholic and caffeinated beverages 
</P>
<P>
 * Heat and Pets 
</P>
<P>
 * And don't forget dogs and cats on those sweltering, summer days.

ONE 'NO' VOTE ON CRIME BILL PROVOKES EARFUL BACK HOME; CONGRESS: TENNESSEE 
DEMOCRAT GETS MIXED SIGNALS FROM VOTERS. BUT ONE THING IS CLEAR -- THEY WANT 
ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stan Cavness made a beeline for Rep. Jim Cooper as soon as the Tennessee 
Democrat arrived at an anti-violence "youth summit" that drew hundreds of young 
people to the local community college this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Cavness, a captain in the Dyersburg Police Department, had only one thing on 
his mind: the stunning vote in the House of Representatives on Thursday to 
derail the $33-billion crime bill. Cooper was one of 58 Democrats who joined 
with all but 11 Republicans to turn away the legislation on a procedural vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not much into partisan politics," Cavness told the soft-spoken Cooper. 
"But we've got to have a crime bill. We're hurting out here in the trenches." 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhat defensively, Cooper quickly promised Cavness that Congress would pass 
an "improved bill" this week. But talking with local reporters a few minutes 
later, he laid out firm conditions for supporting any resurrected crime bill: 
cutting out wasteful "pork-barrel" spending such as a grant to a university in 
the district of House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks (D-Tex.), 
reducing the bill's overall price tag and, most important, voting separately on 
the bill's ban on 19 types of assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 If the House leadership simply brings the same bill back to the floor this 
week, Cooper said, he will vote "no" again. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton is counting on a groundswell of popular support in places 
like this to revive the crime bill, which fell eight votes short in last week's 
tense and emotional showdown. Democrats want to bring the bill back to the 
floor this week, though they remain divided on whether to change the bill, as 
Cooper suggests, or simply attempt another test of strength -- hoping that 
eight legislators felt enough heat at home this past weekend to switch their 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
 A day spent campaigning with Cooper, who is now running for the Senate, 
offered mixed signals on that count: a clear public sense that Washington 
should act on crime, diluted by a lack of clear awareness about the crime 
bill's contents and exactly what happened in Congress last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Had Clinton spent Saturday in this small town 70 miles north of Memphis, he 
would have been encouraged by much of what he heard. At the "Stop The Violence 
Now!" conference, school principals, police officers, ministers and community 
leaders spoke urgently about the prevalence of drugs and juvenile violence in 
these rural surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 All day, sponsors shepherded children as young as 7 into sessions intended to 
instill the lesson that "choices had consequences," as one teacher put it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I regret the vote profoundly," said the Rev. Charles F. McCright, who 
coordinated the conference with the efficiency of a drill sergeant. "Something 
has to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 But relatively few here directly pressed Cooper on his vote, and he heard less 
about it as he campaigned in south-central Tennessee through the afternoon and 
early evening. Near day's end, over a dinner of Cajun fried catfish and 
coleslaw at a country music festival in tiny College Grove, he insisted that 
only three people all day had mentioned the crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Others may not have known to. At "Tina Turner Day" in Nutbush, the singer's 
postmark-sized hometown, Robert Carpenter was stunned and angered to learn that 
Congress had turned down the crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the crime going on . . . that's the main bill we need," he said from 
behind his barbecue stand as Cooper shook hands outside the one-room Tina 
Turner Museum in the weather-beaten local church. 
</P>
<P>
 In College Grove, Jim, a 69-year-old Navy veteran who declined to give his 
last name, did not raise the issue when Cooper sat across from him over dinner. 
But in response to a question after Cooper had left, he said the crime bill 
vote typified what he didn't like about Washington: partisan fights that 
paralyzed action. 
</P>
<P>
 The assault-weapon ban, which generated intense opposition from the National 
Rifle Assn., drew little concern along Cooper's path through this gun-toting 
state. Cooper voted against the ban when the House narrowly approved it in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching as fiddlers and buck dancers competed at the College Grove Music 
Festival in the soft summer dusk, Ollie B. Mautin, a leathery 60-year-old from 
nearby Lewisburg, made clear he was no liberal. A lifelong hunter, Mautin said 
he wants more capital punishment and less welfare. But he sees nothing wrong 
with banning automatic weapons: "These Gatlin' guns, these submachine guns, why 
would anybody want them?" 
</P>
<P>
 Of greater concern along Cooper's stops were arguments that the bill was 
larded with unnecessary spending. "From what I had read, it had too much other 
stuff in it -- social programs," salesman Bob Holcomb said in Nutbush. 
</P>
<P>
 Even state Rep. Lois DeBerry, a Democrat and leader in the African American 
caucus, worried that "people tend to take federal money and it becomes play 
money. There's nobody to watch over it." 
</P>
<P>
 But, in fact, many at the "Stop the Violence Now!" conference said they see 
tangible benefits in programs that some critics dismissed as pork. 
</P>
<P>
 Cavness said the Police Department had been boosted by the three officers it 
had hired with a grant from a pilot program linked to last year's federal 
budget deal. Even more important, he said, the department needed federal funds 
to help build a regional juvenile detention center -- the nearest one is now in 
Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Williams, who ran the housing authority in Humboldt, Tenn., said the 
city had been unable to raise the funds to start an after-school program at the 
local high school; he was hoping the crime bill's prevention money could help. 
</P>
<P>
 Even midnight basketball, which critics of the bill made a symbol of its 
misguided priorities, drew wide support. John Glaze, the pastor at Ross United 
Methodist Church, said evening sports had helped move teen-agers off the 
streets in Memphis and nearby Jackson, and he was trying to raise the money to 
start a league at his church gymnasium here. 
</P>
<P>
 None of those initiatives would be guaranteed federal funding if the crime 
bill passed, but all would be eligible to compete for substantial sums: nearly 
$9 billion for local police departments, $900 million for after-school programs 
in troubled neighborhoods and $40 million for midnight basketball. Juvenile 
detention facilities would be eligible for money from the bill's $6.5-billion 
fund for prison construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor did anyone in Dyersburg look on any federal program as a panacea. Tyles 
Davenport, the soft-spoken principal of the Dyersburg Middle School, said the 
root causes of crime and drug abuse run deeper: proliferation of teen-age 
mothers and single-parent families, a breakdown of discipline and religious 
faith. "Many of these parents did not start to instill the right values in the 
kids at an early age," he said sorrowfully. 
</P>
<P>
 But like most of the others here, Davenport wanted the federal government to 
do its share. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about concerns that the crime bill spent too much money, Michael Savage, 
the unit director for the Boys and Girls Club in Jackson, bristled and said: 
"What about the people spending their lives in funeral parlors funeralizing 
their sons?" 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper appeared eager to avoid crossing those sentiments. In an interview, he 
repeatedly pointed out that his vote was only against the rules by which the 
bill would have been debated on the House floor, not against the bill itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Told about the interest in midnight basketball in Dyersburg, he stiffened. "So 
in a $33-billion bill, they were talking about $40 million?" he asked 
derisively. 
</P>
<P>
 Reminded that those at the conference expressed interest in several of the 
bill's other grant programs, he questioned whether they had really gone through 
the bill's details. Besides, he insisted, with "prior grant programs, Tennessee 
has had to struggle just to get a few crumbs." 
</P>
<P>
 When Glaze approached Cooper about the bill at the youth summit, the candidate 
offered him a much simpler message: Congress would produce an improved bill 
this week.  
</P>
<P>
 Later, Glaze said he was satisfied with Cooper's promise, but he intended to 
keep a close eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want something done," he said. "This is not utopia, and politics is 
give-and-take. The country needs that bill."

MITCHELL, DOLE DIG IN OVER HEALTH; SENATE: APPEARING SIDE BY SIDE, THE MEN SPAR 
OVER MERITS OF DEMOCRATIC BILL. THE GOP LEADER CONCEDES A COMPROMISE MAY BE 
POSSIBLE BUT DOUBTS THAT THE VOTES ARE THERE. 
</P>

<P>
 The Senate's Democratic and Republican leaders dug in their partisan heels on 
health care reform Sunday, further dimming prospects for completing legislation 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press," Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.) vowed that Republicans would not support a government-run health care 
system of the sort he said Senate Democrats had proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is there opportunity for compromise?" Dole asked. "Maybe." But then he added: 
"I don't believe anybody has the votes" to move a health care package through 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), appearing on the same show, 
denied that his bill, a substantially scaled-back version of President 
Clinton's universal coverage measure, constituted a government-run program. 
Besides, he said, Republicans already support massive government health 
programs, including Medicare, and all senators are covered by a government-run 
system that pays 72% of their premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole denied that Senate Republicans are filibustering on the Mitchell bill. 
The full Senate began debating Mitchell's version Tuesday but, after five days, 
had not taken a single vote. Dole said voting on proposed amendments should 
begin this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll be able to determine if and when Republicans ever adopt . . . a 
posture where we are delaying a bill just for delay's sake," Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell acknowledged that his bill's provisions for 95% coverage by the year 
2000 -- about 85% of the population has health insurance now -- would mean that 
health care would absorb one-fifth of the domestic economy in a decade, versus 
one-seventh now. But the Congressional Budget Office estimates that health care 
will account for nearly that much of the economy even without any changes in 
the current system. 
</P>
<P>
 "My plan provides that for the same cost, we bring into the system more than 
30 million people, so I think it's a significant accomplishment," Mitchell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole insisted that it would be politically acceptable for Clinton, who has 
underscored the importance of universal coverage, to sign a compromise health 
measure that stops considerably short of that objective. 
</P>
<P>
 If Congress passes a health care bill, "he'll probably sign it," Dole said. 
"He may suggest that this is not what I wanted, but this does help millions of 
people. It helps them this year. Why put off helping people?" 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Democratic Sen. David L. Boren of Oklahoma pronounced the Mitchell 
bill "dead," adding: "I think we can't even amend it. I think we have to start 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation," Boren said the majority leader's bill 
had so many government price controls and provisions for employers to pay for 
coverage "down the road" that it was supported by "perhaps" only one 
Republican. "That shows there's no hope of bipartisanship there." 
</P>
<P>
 Boren called for working on a more limited measure that "can be a first step, 
that can really be bipartisan." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sen. John B. Breaux (D-La.) said on the same program that he thought the 
Mitchell bill could be passed with eight to 10 amendments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sen. Mitchell's bill has moved towards the center," Breaux said. "I think 
with some additional amendments it can be a package that can pass the Senate 
and, I think, pass the House." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican whip, said "a small" 
health care bill could pass the House this year, but not one that guarantees 
universal coverage. "I can't imagine a left-wing, big-government" health bill 
passing, he said on ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley."

 Southern Californians continued to swelter in triple-digit temperatures in 
many places Sunday, but for the first time in three days the heat did not reach 
record levels, and meteorologists said there may be some relief -- though not 
much -- by midweek. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, temperatures again reached 100 or more in the San Gabriel Valley 
and Inland Empire, but only 95 at the Civic Center, two degrees below the 
record for the date set in 1885. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the mercury hit 102 and on Friday 104 at the Downtown measuring 
point, breaking records set in the last century. 
</P>
<P>
 The dip provided little consolation to the millions of residents who again 
flocked to area beaches, where the crowds and strong tides produced twice the 
usual number of rescues, lifeguards reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been crazy," said Steve Propster, a lifeguard at Hermosa Beach. "This 
heat wave stuff is not too cool." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 80 rescues were made in his area alone, including one after a surfer 
hurt his spine and another when a boat caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Resources were stretched to the limit, said Capt. Russ Walker of the Los 
Angeles County central lifeguard station in Santa Monica.

<P>
 "Our day-watch rescue boats were busy," Walker said. "They have been active 
with boat distress calls and boat fires." 
</P>
<P>
 But authorities reported no serious injuries on the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 A Hesperia family was hospitalized after they were struck by lightning under a 
tree during a storm at Hesperia Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighter Daren Brown said the lightning struck Leona Ellis, who was holding 
her 2 1/2-year-old daughter. "It ran through her, the baby and all the people 
who were around there," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis, the child and the baby's 55-year-old grandmother were in stable 
condition at San Bernardino County Medical Center on Sunday. Another daughter, 
two sons and another boy complained of a tingling feeling or loss of sensation 
and were hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety officials advise against seeking shelter under trees during 
thunderstorms. 
</P>
<P>
 Away from the beaches, hundreds of thousands kept their cool with air 
conditioning, again taxing power utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Overuse caused minor power failures for Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power customers in Silver Lake, West Los Angeles, Hollywood and parts of the 
San Fernando Valley, while Southern California Edison reported brief outages in 
Sylmar and Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Power was back in all areas by midafternoon, though the utilities urged 
customers to be prudent with air conditioning where possible. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Southern California Edison reported that its customers used more 
power than on any day since Aug. 17, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 About 5,700 Los Angeles Central Men's Jail inmates and 300 sheriff's deputies 
sweltered in an unairconditioned building after a faulty air-conditioning 
system finally quit Sunday, Deputy Brian Jones said. It began malfunctioning 
Wednesday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 High temperatures had made the jailhouse hot and sticky as the mercury inside 
the building rose to 86 degrees, Jones said. Extra fans were brought into the 
four-story building, and inmates were given extra showers and liquids. However, 
none of the inmates required treatment for heat-related medical problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The system was repaired and running again Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Meteorologist Curtis Brack of WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for 
The Times, said the heat wave was caused by a very strong high pressure area 
over California that was blocking cooler marine air from coming inland. But as 
the week progresses, "skies should be clearing out somewhat," he said, allowing 
temperatures to drop further. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, meteorologists were not ruling out a return to record highs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, I can't promise much relief yet," said Bruce Entwistle of the 
National Weather Service, predicting that temperatures "will bounce up and down 
a few degrees each day." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the weather may become more humid, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Los Angeles County lifeguards said that more than 1 million people 
sought relief at the beach. And others found remedies closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Lee, a West Los Angeles homemaker, said she dug out an old parasol for 
the first time since she moved to Los Angeles two decades ago and used it 
walking to church. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, she stayed home with her shades drawn and was "trying not to move 
my body." 
</P>
<P>
 In San Bernardino County, more than 700 firefighters continued to fight two 
brush fires touched off by lightning Saturday. By midafternoon Sunday, the 
1,800-acre fires north of Lake Arrowhead were reported 50% under control, with 
no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now we are looking at the real hot weather and more thunderstorms 
coming," said Tom Sensintaff, a spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service, which 
was coordinating firefighting efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The hottest spots in Southern California on Sunday included Monrovia and 
Montebello, with highs of 103 degrees, Pasadena at 102 and San Bernardino, 
where the temperature reached 100 at the 3 p.m. measuring time. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, a dangerous combination of rip currents and large surf -- up 
to 10 to 12 feet at some beaches -- kept lifeguards extremely busy during 
another day of large crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The water has been pulling people into the rips and then out to sea," said 
Huntington State Beach Lifeguard Supervisor William Pfeiffer. 
</P>
<P>
 Lifeguards up and down the county's 42-mile coast reported similar conditions 
-- and double the normal number of surf rescues. It was at Newport Beach that 
lifeguards reported the surf as high as 12 feet, though no major injuries were 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 In Seal Beach, near the Los Angeles County border, lifeguards took the unusual 
precaution of closing off 100 yards of beach to swimmers immediately north of 
the city pier. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a very inexperienced swimming crowd today, and then large surf and 
heavy rip currents," said Andrew Seymour, Seal Beach director of parks, 
beaches, and recreation. "(The beach closure) was an unusual move, but it's a 
safety precaution. Our rescue boat was working hard today." 
</P>
<P>
 In Little Tokyo, visitors and merchants at the Nisei Week Japanese Festival 
cursed the double blow that the sweltering weather delivered Sunday: It felt 
miserable, and it was keeping business away. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, however, found a bright note in the communal suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business is good -- thanks to the hot weather," said a beaming Jong Ho Park, 
who works at Bourbon Street Liquor in Koreatown. "Beers, soft drinks and ice 
are much in demand today." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Park noted that he has had to turn up the air conditioning to 
accommodate his customers -- so he may not be that much ahead after his 
electric bill arrives.

WHEN PUBLIC RIGHT TO KNOW TAKES A BACK SEAT IN COURT; LAW: THERE ARE MANY 
REASONS JUDGES KEEP DOCUMENTS OR OTHER ITEMS, LIKE SIMPSON MYSTERY ENVELOPE, 
SECRET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just before the Fourth of July weekend began, a Los Angeles judge revealed 
that O.J. Simpson's defense lawyers had turned over a bulky manila envelope, 
setting off speculation that the envelope contains evidence critical to the 
outcome of the former football star's double murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 The contents of the envelope have remained a mystery to prosecutors, who asked 
to see them. Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito is scheduled to rule on that 
request Thursday, but it is possible that the envelope's contents never will be 
revealed publicly. 
</P>
<P>
 Although people accused of crimes are guaranteed a speedy and public trial by 
the Constitution, elements of these proceedings sometimes take place behind 
closed doors. Indeed, some documents filed in both criminal and civil cases 
remain secret forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Some things are routinely kept from the public -- at least temporarily -- in 
an attempt to avoid potentially prejudicial publicity, said USC constitutional 
law professor Erwin Chemerinsky. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, on Friday, Judge Ito refused to allow the news media to view 
photos of the bloody bodies of murder victims Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald 
Lyle Goldman, at least until he has ruled on whether those photos will be 
admitted into evidence during Simpson's trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus far, eight motions and five court orders have been filed under seal in 
the Simpson case, according to a court log. Sealed motions are not unusual, but 
like everything else in this case, these have aroused considerable curiosity -- 
and speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The opportunity for both the state and the defendant to present their 
evidence and make their arguments to legal decision-makers (judges and juries), 
and the right of the public to have access to these proceedings to ensure their 
legitimacy, are two fundamental attributes of due process," said UCLA criminal 
law professor Peter Arenella. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the secret ex parte hearings (when the judge meets with only one side) to 
consider sealed motions in the Simpson case illustrate that sometimes both the 
public's right of access and the opposing party's opportunity to be heard can 
be either denied or at least delayed to protect countervailing interests," 
Arenella said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These might include the confidentiality of attorney-client communications, 
the privacy rights of third parties, the security of witnesses and the need to 
prevent disclosure of potential trial strategy to the opposing party prior to 
trial," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 In some instances, both the public and one side -- the prosecution or the 
defense -- are kept in the dark about something, such as the contents of the 
manila envelope. In other instances, only the news media, and by extension the 
public, are kept in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the parties in a case find themselves litigating ferociously over 
access to information. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, as with the photos in the Simpson case, the prosecution and the 
defense join to keep something secret from the public, at least temporarily. 
Both Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark and defense lawyer Robert L. Shapiro say 
that allowing the media to see and describe the photos could endanger Simpson's 
right to a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, courts have overruled objections to showing potentially prejudicial 
material. In 1983 a federal appeals court in Los Angeles ruled, before auto 
mogul John Z. DeLorean's trial, that CBS could show surveillance tapes of him 
engaged in a drug sting. (DeLorean was acquitted.) 
</P>
<P>
 Appellate Judge William Norris said the court had to "resolve the tension" 
between DeLorean's right to an impartial jury and the right of the news media 
to be free from governmental restraints that violate the 1st Amendment. The 
appeals court panel ruled that both defense and prosecution, who objected to 
airing the tapes, had failed to demonstrate that it was impossible to get an 
impartial jury except by halting broadcast of the tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is a long line of cases stating that trials and preliminary 
hearings are open to the public, other decisions make it clear that the public 
-- and sometimes either the defense or the prosecution -- cannot get immediate 
access to all the material in a case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public has no general 1st Amendment right of access to participate in 
discovery proceedings between the prosecution and the defense prior to trial," 
Arenella said. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola Law School professor Laurie Levenson said material is typically sealed 
"when one side does not want the other side to see something and has a 
legitimate concern that would justify keeping something confidential." 
</P>
<P>
 But a lawyer cannot simply get something sealed on a whim, stressed Los 
Angeles defense lawyer Gerald L. Chaleff. "When you file a motion under seal, 
it has to relate to something that is privileged or the lawyer has to give some 
other reason why the material should not become public," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego criminal defense attorney Elisabeth Semel said some material almost 
always can be sealed. One classic example, she said, is a lawyer representing 
an indigent defendant asking a judge for money to hire an expert witness. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason such a request is kept secret from the other side is that it 
reveals the lawyer's strategy and thus could endanger the client's right to a 
fair trial if disclosed, Semel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, she said, a lawyer's affidavit supporting the request generally 
reflects attorney-client conversations whose disclosure would violate the 
sanctity of privileged communications. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, Semel was allowed to keep sealed her explanation to a judge about 
why she wanted California Corrections Department records about an inmate who 
might testify against her client in a murder trial. But a California appeals 
court ruled that the prosecutors were entitled both to know about her request 
and to get copies of the records. 
</P>
<P>
 Closed-door hearings between a judge and a prosecutor are frequently held 
after a defense lawyer has requested internal police department records of a 
potential police witness. In such hearings, the judge generally examines the 
records and assesses their relevance. The records the judge deems relevant are 
turned over to the defense lawyer and the others are not. The defense lawyer is 
not entitled to be present at this hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Another classic example is a prosecutor requesting a protective order so that 
the defense cannot learn a potential prosecution witness's address, lest that 
disclosure endanger the potential witness. Such requests are granted often, 
much to the vexation of defense lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes it very hard to impeach a witness if you don't know where he lives," 
because it makes it more difficult to do research on the witness, said Los 
Angeles defense lawyer Leslie Abramson. 
</P>
<P>
 Some requests are unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 After Los Angeles defense lawyer Andrew Stein doubted an alibi offered by a 
man he was defending on murder charges, he filed a sealed motion asking the 
court to pay for a documents examiner. 
</P>
<P>
 His client had claimed to be interviewing for a job when the murder occurred. 
The examiner, Stein explained, could study employment office records for 
authenticity. The judge agreed, an examiner was hired, and because the 
examination cast doubt on the reliability of the documents, Stein did not offer 
the alibi at trial. His client was convicted and the document remains under 
seal. 
</P>
<P>
 The outer boundaries of what can be sealed are murky, leading to vigorous 
battles during the early phases of cases. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Menendez brothers murder case, for example, prosecutors learned that 
the defendants had made some potentially incriminating statements to a 
psychologist. Contending that the therapist-patient privilege had been breached 
by discussion of the possible commission of a crime, prosecutors argued for 
access to tapes of those conversations. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense vigorously opposed this move, and filed sealed motions arguing 
against prosecutors' access and explaining its reasons in a closed hearing 
before the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the judge ruled that some parts of the tapes should be given to 
prosecutors, and others should not. The prosecution used the tapes at trial, 
but the other conversations remain under seal. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other items that may be kept out of public view at least temporarily 
are search warrants and the police affidavits explaining why the warrants are 
needed. Both the warrants and the supporting affidavits usually become public 
within days after the warrants have been served. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet an affidavit from a federal prosecutor outlining why the government was 
entitled to bug FBI agent Richard Miller, later convicted of passing secret 
information to the Soviets, has never been unsealed, according to Stanley 
Greenberg, one of Miller's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg said he suspected that is because it would reveal the name of a 
confidential informant, perhaps endangering the person. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to question the legality of the electronic surveillance without 
knowing the 'probable cause' that justified it," Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 As such cases illustrate, Levenson noted, the entire process of sealed motions 
is based on the assumption that the judge will consider the interest of the 
side that is not at the closed hearing. But despite that, the absent party 
often feels frustrated and powerless. "It's like shooting blindfolded," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In one high-profile 1990 trial in Los Angeles, sealed motions led to open 
warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers for a Mexican businessman accused of playing a lead role in a 
conspiracy to murder U.S. drug enforcement agent Enrique Camarena asked Los 
Angeles federal Judge Edward Rafeedie to remove himself from the case unless he 
agreed to turn over numerous documents prosecutors filed in secret. 
</P>
<P>
 For six months, between August, 1989, and February, 1990, prosecutors filed 
eight sealed motions. The defense countered that the documents might contain 
material that could help them fight the government's case, and said their 
effort was being damaged by the prosecutors' "one-way dialogue" with the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors frequently use such sealed motions in drug cases to protect 
confidential informants or to withhold the identity of potential witnesses for 
as long as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafeedie declined to leave the case and told defense lawyers they were not 
entitled to the material, citing several appellate court decisions permitting 
the government to make secret filings. 
</P>
<P>
 As these cases demonstrate, the trial judge generally has broad latitude over 
what material can be kept confidential and for how long. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Judge Ito, responding to a request from The Times and several other 
news media organizations, last week released a transcript of a closed-door 
proceeding in which attorneys discussed phone records of a call to Nicole 
Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito kept other transcripts sealed for now: one involving witness security, and 
two others of his meetings with defense attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other transcripts involve the contents of the mystery envelope, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is possible that Simpson prosecutors will learn what's in the 
envelope this week, it seems doubtful that the public will, Arenella said. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA professor offered a scenario based on the suggestion that the 
envelope contains a knife that witnesses said Simpson purchased at a Downtown 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's assume it's the knife Simpson purchased at Ross Cutlery but the knife 
is not, in fact, the murder weapon," Arenella said. "In these circumstances, it 
is highly likely that the evidence could be presented by the defense at Mr. 
Simpson's trial, if the prosecution decides to call to the witness stand the 
people from the shop who sold him the knife. In such a scenario, the defense 
would introduce the knife to rebut the prosecution's suggestion that this could 
be the murder weapon." 
</P>
<P>
 A key reason the defense would not have kept back the knife to flourish at the 
trial is that 30 days before the trial begins -- which would be later this week 
-- the prosecution is entitled to see any evidence the defense plans to use. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution, however, would not decide until after it had forensic tests 
performed whether to use at trial either the knife or the people who sold it to 
Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 So, Arenella said, "I don't see why the public would have any right of access 
to this material at this juncture because it's not evidence yet. The public's 
right of access is dependent on whether it will become trial evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Another possibility, Arenella said, is that the knife is the murder weapon -- 
incriminating evidence that could point to Simpson or someone else. "If it 
points to Simpson, the prosecution will be given access to the knife. The 
public will see it at the trial, but there would be no statement about the 
source of the knife," Arenella said. 
</P>
<P>
 That is because other cases have held that it would be excessively prejudicial 
for a jury to be told that a defendant's lawyer had handed over the murder 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another possibility is that the prosecutors will decide not to use the 
cutlery salesmen as witnesses and therefore the knife will become irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
 And of course, Arenella stressed, it is entirely possible that the envelope 
contains something else, raising a host of other scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the intense curiosity about the Simpson case, Arenella said he thinks it 
likely that the contents of the envelope ultimately will be revealed -- perhaps 
by a leak from one side or the other.

WOODSTOCK WRAPS UP WITH WET, WILD FINALE; CONCERT: THE END OF THE '94 FESTIVAL 
PLAYS LIKE A '69 FLASHBACK, WITH CONFUSION, CONGESTION, MUD PREVAILING. ABOUT 
300,000 FANS ATTENDED OVER WEEKEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After a final long day of music, Woodstock '94 sent its weary, mud-caked 
children homeward late Sunday on a fitful exodus bogged down by foul weather, 
lakes of mud and a massive crush of humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the three-day festival's final day of music started, thousands of 
concert-goers began straggling out in long lines from the site, where Woodstock 
producers estimated that more than 350,000 fans had gathered before their ranks 
began to shrink early Sunday under driving rain. 
</P>
<P>
 New York State Police, however, said the crowd never exceeded 300,000, and 
concert producers said their ticket sales fell nearly 50,000 short of the 
250,000 they had hoped to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Like its 1969 parent, Woodstock '94 ended with the sort of logistics woes that 
have vexed almost every major rock festival since that earlier time. The sheer 
number of fans, the taxing weather and lapses by concert management created 
scenes of slow-motion anarchy, where each hour brought more confusion and 
breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Persistent storms dropped rain all night Saturday and during the day Sunday, 
driving the weather-weary toward an early exit, moving in long lines along 
hillside roads and clustering in vast parking lots. They passed smaller knots 
of rock devotees traveling in the opposite direction, lured to the site by the 
sudden withdrawal of hundreds of security guards from the festival's gates and 
checkpoints. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite promoters' denials, Woodstock's final day was essentially a free 
concert. As those leaving streamed out of the 840-acre site, lugging mud-caked 
tents and backpacks, hard-core fans stayed in the fields around the two main 
stages, listening to rock artists like Bob Dylan and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. 
However, unlike the crush on Saturday, spaces could be found. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything I own is wet," said Neil Alexander, 23, of Landover, Md. "And you 
know what, I don't care. This is what Woodstock is supposed to be. It's too 
much." 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom went to the first one. I'll tell my kids to go to the reunion," said 
Blake Phillips, 19, of New Haven, Conn. " . . . She said be prepared because 
it's going to be messy."  
</P>
<P>
 Those who stayed made their peace with the mud. Some played touch football in 
the slicks, some dived in and slid like frisky seals, some even packed the 
light brown goo into jars to cart home as mementos. 
</P>
<P>
 Others had their fill. "I can't take any more of this," said Angie Lane, 22, 
of Easley, S.C., as she and her boyfriend teetered in the mud, packing up a 
small tent and mounds of spattered clothes. "I just want to be in my living 
room right now, watching this on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 State Police officials began blocking local roads and thruway exits in the 
hilly Saugerties area early Sunday, preparing for the drawn-out exodus, which 
they predicted could take up to a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system really started to break down because of the rain," said John 
Scher, president of PolyGram Diversified Ventures, which put up $30 million in 
front money for the concert. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't deny we did not have the requisite number of people needed to really 
control this event," said Robert C. G. Disney, the festival's director of 
security and safety. ". . . I wanted to be proactive, but as a result of the 
number of people who showed up, we had to end up being reactive." Other concert 
officials said that in retrospect, they also would have added extra security. 
</P>
<P>
 In some respects, Woodstock '94 was very lucky. Concert organizers spent 
harrowing moments Saturday darting in and out of their weather trailer as a 
storm packing lightning and 65 m.p.h. winds bore down on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Just when they feared the worst, the storm veered off -- but its fringes were 
strong enough to cause major headaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got very lucky," said John Roberts, one of Woodstock's principal 
producers. "But the the mud has made it tough for the kids to get home." 
</P>
<P>
 Although there were two deaths -- one attributed to complications of diabetes 
and another caused by a ruptured spleen -- most injuries and ailments were 
minor, health authorities and concert medics said. Nevertheless, medical 
problems sent more than 1,600 patients to the festival's hospital and at least 
another 3,000 to 13 satellite clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 The cases came in at a staggering rate. During peak hours, "we're seeing one 
patient every 20 seconds," said Dr. Ferdinand Anderson, the concert's medical 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the site's first aid clinics were temporarily closed because of the 
crush. Action was most fierce at a post near the main stage's "mosh pit," where 
dancers massed together, slamming into each other and hoisting others up over 
their shoulders for dangerous spates of "body surfing." 
</P>
<P>
 Knocked to the ground by several of the dancers, Kristalynn Landolfi, 23, an 
aspiring actress from Red Bank, N.J., awoke as medics swabbed her bloody face. 
Several minutes later, they told her that her nose was broken in two places. 
</P>
<P>
 Landolfi was determined to stay. "I paid $400 for this ticket. I came for a 
peaceful vibe and I'm going to get it," she said through gritted teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene was just as chaotic at the festival's main hospital, where patient 
after patient was carted in by stretcher, suffering from a dizzying assortment 
of ailments: drug overdoses, sprains, cuts and hypothermia. Nurses rushed 
about, treating wounds and ministering to youths coming down from bad LSD trips 
and too much liquor. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, two people leaving the festival to return to the Chicago area were 
killed when their car crashed on the New York State Thruway, after the driver 
fell asleep, state troopers said. Two others were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the stretcher-bearers weaved in and out of the festival crowd, the 
concert's floating drug bazaar continued to pulse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trips! Trips!" cried packs of longhaired youths milling in the crowd. Some 
were selling, others seeking to buy. Two bleary-eyed, grinning teen-agers from 
Kingston, N.Y., staggered down a muddy path, flashing peace signs and hunting 
for LSD. 
</P>
<P>
 "Felix the Cat is good, man, and so is the white with blue moons and stars," 
said one of the youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hospital reports a lot of bad acid out there," concert emcee Alan 
(Brother Wese) Levine bellowed over the main stage's massive speaker towers 
several hours later. "Watch out for the Felix the Cat, Flintstones, Fireworks, 
Weasel. Keep that bad stuff out of your mouth, man." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite promoters' insistence before the festival's start that narcotics would 
not be tolerated, low-level security personnel questioned Sunday whether the 
effort was real. 
</P>
<P>
 Guards also said that more than 500 security personnel fled the festival site 
Saturday and Sunday, angered at long shifts without food and sanitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Security was also a problem in the food concession area. One row of food 
stands near the main stage was overrun by hungry fans Saturday. Wave after wave 
of youths surged into the food tents, grabbing sodas and stuffing hamburgers in 
their pockets.

 As the day wore on, and the search shifted from sustenance to the road out, 
the new Woodstock Generation made a last search for the perfect souvenir. 
</P>
<P>
 Some carried expensive T-shirts, others pocketed guitar-and-dove bracelets and 
figurines. And deep in the sea of mud, 22-year-old Brian Aplustille of Long 
Island, N.Y., found the perfect memento.

 "I'm keeping a jar of mud," he said. "And these sneakers are being retired."

ONLY MEXICAN VOTERS KNOW POLLS' VALIDITY 
</P>

 After six months on a high-tech roller-coaster ride unprecedented in Mexico's 
political history, the final results have poured in -- a blizzard of graphs, 
pie charts and percentage points from more than half a dozen major polls, all 
designed to predict which of the three leading candidates will win Mexico's 
presidential election Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 And the winner is . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it all depends on how you look at it. And whether you should look at it 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Such, it seems, is the nature of the wild encuesta , Mexico's first attempt to 
enlist a battery of experts to conduct independent, computerized, randomly 
sampled polls in advance of what promises to be the freest and fairest election 
since the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) began 65 years of unbroken 
and sometimes authoritarian rule in 1929. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the experts were some of the most prestigious pollsters in the world: 
Washington-based Belden & Russonello, Louis Harris-Indemerc (the Mexican 
affiliate of New York-based Louis Harris International) and MORI of London. 
</P>
<P>
 In total, they interviewed, analyzed and tried to predict the responses of 
thousands of Mexicans based on the techniques they have used throughout the 
world to produce what have long been a staple of presidential politics in the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps not surprisingly, the results released Thursday and Friday -- the 
deadline for publication of opinion polls -- varied little in their findings: 
</P>
<P>
 Ernesto Zedillo, the candidate of the ruling PRI, would win by a large margin 
over his two major challengers with as much as 55% or as little as 38% of the 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 But behind that prediction was an array of qualifications, controversies and 
uncertainties that say as much about the political climate in Mexico today as 
they do about the "science" of political polling in a virgin land. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of what came to be known here as "the war of the polls" is a 
basic question: Will potential voters even hint at the truth about their 
politics to a total stranger in a nation where a single party has had a 
stranglehold on power for more than six decades? 
</P>
<P>
 The mere fact that there even were encuestas, or polls, appeared as a dramatic 
illustration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's reform policies, which 
permitted the importation of the high-tech hardware and software for 
independent experts to do their own polling for the first time. In the past, 
only the government was permitted to publish such polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas also has sanctioned the sweeping electoral reforms, among them 
credible computerized voter-registration lists and identity cards, that have 
helped make this presidential race a real contest. The reforms have created one 
of the tightest electoral battles in Mexican history -- and a vast market for 
the pollsters' predictions. 
</P>
<P>
 As MORI President Robert Worcester put it at a news conference here last week: 
"What accounts for the increased interest (in the polls) is that for the first 
time in 60 years you've got a chance for an upset. . . . I think it's a long 
shot, but you've got an electorate that is ready for change." 
</P>
<P>
 The race has been a three-way affair among Zedillo and opposition leaders 
Diego Fernandez de Cevallos and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas -- of the right and left, 
respectively -- and percentages of support have changed almost daily. Also 
almost daily, it seemed, there was a new poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Their final predictions of a PRI victory notwithstanding, the pollsters were 
the first to congratulate the government for permitting the surveys in the 
first place. "The contribution of polls to emerging and continuing democracies 
is absolutely essential," said Nancy Belden of Belden & Russonello. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics -- chiefly the opposition parties and political analysts who 
support them -- have asserted that the polls have been co-opted by the ruling 
party. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the institutions that contracted with the polling firms are, in fact, 
supporters of the ruling party. Among them are U.S. and European banks with 
investments in Mexico, which depend on the stability of the status quo. Others 
are newspapers and broadcast media that openly endorse the PRI. 
</P>
<P>
 And the pollsters themselves represent companies with vested interests in the 
outcome of the election; most have had contracts with the government in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are like turf battles in the Mafia," Federico Estevez, director of the 
social sciences department at the Autonomous Technical Institute of Mexico, 
said of the competition among the pollsters. "They're all fighting for future 
contracts." 
</P>
<P>
 But Estevez, who has done his own "poll of the polls" since the campaign 
began, insisted that he finds their results credible, concluding last week that 
the presidential race is "more over than ever." 
</P>
<P>
 The pollsters themselves were careful to say that they aren't completely sure 
of the outcome. Most stressed that shifts still could occur before Election 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
 In releasing the poll that gave Zedillo and the PRI the largest margin of 
victory -- as much as 44%, or even 55% if the undecided vote is factored in, 
over Fernandez's 19% -- Louis Harris President Humphrey Taylor said: "Is it 
certain that PRI will win? The answer, I think, is yes, unless something very 
dramatic happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Belden, in releasing her poll giving Zedillo 46% and Fernandez 19%, noted: "At 
times, big events in the closing days of an election have a profound impact. 
However, the lead at this point is commanding, and it would take a serious turn 
of events to catapult another candidate into the lead." 
</P>
<P>
 And MORI's Worcester was even more guarded on his group's poll, which gave 
Zedillo 38% to Fernandez's 22%. He provided a list of statistical aberrations 
that could render his measurement -- indeed, all the polls -- simply wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 At the top of the list, Worcester said, is what he called "the spiral of 
silence," a statistical "skew" that his Mexican partner, Miguel Basanez, says 
indicated that voters were more apt to tell the truth if interviewed in the 
anonymity of the streets than in their homes. Simply stated, Worcester said, 
the "spiral" is voter anxiety about stating any preference other than a ruling 
party that has been known to intimidate voters in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 MORI's predictions, he said, try to factor in that skew through a process he 
called "massaging." A competitor called it "propaganda." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not propaganda," Worcester said. "It's psephology . . . the study of 
elections. And I think the failure to (factor in such skews) is stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 Worcester said the hardest element to factor in is the large percentage of 
voters who either said they had not decided or refused to answer -- a group 
that strategists with Fernandez's National Action Party said almost certainly 
will vote for Fernandez or Cardenas and his Democratic Revolutionary Party. 
</P>
<P>
 And polls that tried to ask "attitude" questions in an effort to determine 
whether respondents were lying out of fear did raise questions about their 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
 In Belden's study, for example, 55% of 1,526 likely voters said they believed 
an opposition party could win more votes than the PRI. In addition, 56% said 
they believed people were afraid to speak freely about politics and government. 
</P>
<P>
 And when asked to name the principal problem in Mexico today, the overwhelming 
majority listed unemployment, the economy, poverty, personal security and 
corruption -- traditional weaknesses for an incumbent party. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to square such apparent contradictions with the overwhelming 
preference for the PRI recorded by pollsters, Belden said the ruling party's 
lead "relies on a lack of enthusiasm for the alternative candidates" and 
indicates that, despite their dissatisfaction, voters "are not yet willing to 
commit to change at the hands of another party." 
</P>
<P>
 The Harris poll also reflected negative attitudes toward the government. In 
discussing that and the possibility that respondents lied to protect 
themselves, Taylor said: "Is it possible this poll is very wrong? Of course 
that is possible. There are many reasons why polls are wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor said the poll tried to account for lying and fear. 
</P>
<P>
 But in addressing the question of whether opinions will change in the final 
week -- indeed, whether the polls will affect voter sentiment -- Taylor was not 
so certain. "That always makes me very nervous and anxious," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Worcester, in particular, cited what is known as "the boomerang effect" in 
suggesting that the flood of polls giving Zedillo a huge lead could work 
against the ruling party by making its voters complacent and by pushing 
marginal opposition supporters into voting. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Castillo is counting on it. Castillo is the president of Fernandez's 
party, which he said has been conducting polls of its own but keeping the 
results confidential. "With all the polls saying the PRI is very strong, we 
think people will vote against the PRI," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Castillo added, there is another reason his party is not publishing its 
poll results. 
</P>
<P>
 "The polls show, for example, that there are a lot of people who know for 
which candidate they will vote but will not say publicly. If these people were 
going to vote PRI, surely they would say PRI. 
</P>
<P>
 "But at this point, it is all just guessing. I believe the only good poll is 
the poll on Election Day."

BURUNDI BATTLES ITS DEMONS IN FIGHT TO SURVIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hollow-log drums throb. Dancers in togas churn up red-powdered dust. It is 
Sunday and 5,000 villagers press close as their young and inexperienced 
president steps forward to try to give them hope against the genocidal 
bloodshed spreading across this troubled nation once again. 
</P>
<P>
 Burundi is Rwanda's blood brother, born from the same German-cum-Belgian 
coffee colony and living with the same Hutu-versus-Tutsi ethnic struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 With a population of slightly more than 5 million, Burundi may have lost more 
people in the last 10 months than the United States lost in 10 years of 
fighting in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 And by all accounts, Burundi "is now on the edge of the knife," to use a local 
colloquialism. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two weeks, grenades have been thrown into crowds in the capital, 
Bujumbura. And in the outlying villages, Hutus who killed Tutsis during last 
year's bloodletting are now being killed in reprisal, in the dark of night with 
machetes and guns. 
</P>
<P>
 After sunset, the streets of city and village alike are barren. Soldiers 
maintain checkpoints every few miles. Outsiders have been warned not to travel 
here. Relief workers call it one of the spookiest countries in the world and 
count the days until they can leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the weekend, a staff worker with the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner 
for Refugees was shot to death in northern Burundi. The relief worker was in 
his home meeting with a local Hutu official. 
</P>
<P>
 Burundi -- and the world -- has seen this deadly cycle before. Most recently, 
tensions like those enveloping Burundi today created the tragedy still playing 
out in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are two fears in Burundi," said Rob Denny, a Red Cross worker in 
Bujumbura. "One of them is each ethnic group's fear of the other. And second is 
the fear of becoming another Rwanda. And these two fears have to stay in rough 
balance or the place will explode." 
</P>
<P>
 The village of Bumba lies north of the capital in the highlands -- an hour by 
road and then another hour over a rotting trail. This is steep mountain country 
of terraced farms, dark woods and ceaseless fear. 
</P>
<P>
 The big drums stop. The dancers step back. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a Western suit and tie, President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya addresses 
the crowd with the question everyone asks and no one can answer: "How long is 
the blood going to flow in this country?" 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd murmurs. Ntibantunganya, 38, is the third Hutu president since 
October. The army, dominated by Tutsis, killed the first in a coup attempt. The 
second died with the Rwandan president in April when their airplane crashed 
near the Rwandan capital, Kigali, setting off a frenzy of killing in that 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Ntibantunganya holds in his hand a country that can be likened to a cup 
so completely laced with cracks that it seems only a matter of time until it 
crumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider this: Hutus, who make up about 85% of the population, are apparently 
arming themselves with weapons confiscated in Zaire from Rwandan refugees. In 
the past, the Hutus, most of them farmers, had only blades as weapons and 
therefore were easy for the 22,000-member Tutsi army to subjugate. Now, 
analysts wonder how long it will be before the Hutus can be called an actual 
rebel army. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you imagine a place where the chief support of the government is the 
rebels? It's completely mad," said Denny, the Red Cross worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Tutsi youth extremists are roaming the streets, provoking violence 
and apparently trying to force their Tutsi army into taking control of the 
country. Among the extremist leaders is one man who wants to assume the 
position of king. 
</P>
<P>
 After the army coup attempt in October, Burundi turned on itself with a 
vengeance. Early estimates put the death toll at 100,000. More recently, relief 
agencies have revised their estimates of the slaughter to something more than 
50,000. Most of them were Tutsis. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that rampage, the army has regained control and the killing has been 
reduced. So far this year, Amnesty International says, 2,000 have died. 
</P>
<P>
 But the deaths and violence are spreading again. 
</P>
<P>
 And on top of their generations-old hatred of each other, both ethnic groups 
are feeding ravenously on today's grudges. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hutus are angry because the 1993 election that gave them control of the 
country for the first time in modern years was spoiled by the army coup 
attempt. The Tutsis are vengeful because the Hutus rose up and massacred Tutsi 
loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the recent civil war in Rwanda has destabilized this southern 
kin. About 200,000 Hutu refugees from Rwanda have fled across the border here, 
and some of their camps are located near refugee encampments of displaced 
Burundi Tutsis. 
</P>
<P>
 The president has asked for a team of U.N. human rights observers to 
discourage extremism, but there has been no Security Council approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Genocidal warfare has exploded here on epic scale at least twice previously 
since independence in 1962. And the violence has occurred despite a history of 
attempts by moderate leaders to bring the Hutus and Tutsis into accommodation. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview over the weekend, Education Minister Liboire Ngendahayo 
grasped at a slender straw: "We think it is possible we can avoid the problem 
of Rwanda because here there is still dialogue between the parties." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Burundi does not lack for peacemakers. On Sunday, the Tutsi army 
guarded the Hutu president on his visit to Hutu-dominated Bumba. And the 
president has taken great pains in introducing Tutsis into his government. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's trying to show that he can work with the Tutsi, and so should they," an 
aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ntibantunganya's hourlong speech hardly veered from the turmoil engulfing his 
country: "I have come here with a present. This is a speech about peace. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "When the peace is troubled, the cost is enormous -- people die, houses are 
burned, as you can see. . . . What do you gain when you start killing and 
shedding blood? Do you drink it? Do you make bricks for your houses from it? 
Who among us has gained from blood running in the streets?" 
</P>
<P>
 But when it came time for the audience to address the president, Burundi's 
great divide was without any visible bridges. A Tutsi woman arose to say that 
she needs the army to protect her from rampaging Hutus. A Hutu man took his 
turn and said it is the Tutsi army that is running wild and killing Hutus. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that is most amazing," one Western diplomat in Bujumbura said, "is 
that it has withstood all these provocations without even greater troubles. 
These people are really sick of it."

GLENDALE TURNS TO NIGHT SCHOOL TO EASE CROWDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the fall of 1995, a new kind of high school will open in Glendale -- one 
where classes begin at about 2 in the afternoon and end at 9 at night. 
</P>
<P>
 The principal, teachers and students will have use of all the facilities and 
supplies available at an existing high school campus and will start their 
classes just as the typical school day is about to end. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet this high school will have its own identity, even its own name. 
</P>
<P>
 The new school, for now known simply as Evening High School, is believed to be 
one of the first of its kind in California. Less than a dozen evening high 
schools with regular curricula are known to exist nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the country, adult-education programs and continuation schools for 
teen-agers struggling with academics are commonly offered in the evening. But 
education groups in California and elsewhere say evening comprehensive classes 
for regular high school students are rare. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Unified School District officials turned to the unusual alternative 
in the hope of alleviating crowding. The district is ready to burst at the 
seams with nearly 29,000 students crammed into a traditional class schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually every school district today appears to be grappling with formidable 
problems -- budget cuts, teen-age dropouts, crowded classrooms and combinations 
of all three. 
</P>
<P>
 Staggering the school day is just one way of coping. Some say that Glendale's 
program and others like it offer a foretaste of how many secondary schools will 
one day operate. 
</P>
<P>
 "People need their institutions to be as flexible as they are. What you're 
seeing is schools starting to respond to that," said Michael Casserly, who 
heads the Council of the Great City Schools, a coalition of the nation's 
largest public school systems. 
</P>
<P>
 In Glendale, district officials had considered a year-round program for the 
high schools to cope with rapidly rising enrollment. But they decided against 
offering year-round sessions because of a perceived difficulty with getting 
students fully prepared in time for colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Another option, installing portable classrooms, was turned down when the 
district determined that its high school campuses lacked enough space. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year and this year, a Glendale high school principal toured two 
out-of-state high schools where many students thrived on evening learning. 
</P>
<P>
 A task force of parents, students, teachers and school officials helped 
develop a preliminary plan for an evening high school in Glendale that was 
unanimously approved by the school board in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction to the voluntary night school program has been mixed within the 
school system. The Glendale Teachers Assn. backed the plan. But on at least one 
campus, Glendale High School, the issue has polarized parents and students. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is students think this is a school for people who don't have a 
clue, and the parents don't want their children home all day without 
supervision," said Candace Hakonsson, 16, a task force member who read more 
than 100 responses to a recent survey about the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Details about the new high school are still subject to change, but are not 
likely to be greatly altered. 
</P>
<P>
 * A school site will be chosen by October of this year from among three 
existing campuses: Crescenta Valley, Glendale and Hoover high schools. A 
principal, whose early responsibility is to meet with interested students and 
parents, will be chosen the following month. 
</P>
<P>
 * Student registration will take place from March to April of next year. 
Enrollment is voluntary and all Glendale students who will be in grades nine 
through 12 are eligible to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 * The principal will begin to staff the high school in April. Teachers already 
in Glendale schools will be able to easily transfer into Evening High School 
before the district determines whether additional instructors need to be hired. 
</P>
<P>
 * Classes begin in September, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The district expects to draw a wide range of students -- from those who are 
college-bound to those at risk of dropping out. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical set of classes will be offered, such as English, math, science, 
history and physical education. The high school's core curriculum meets 
entrance requirements for the University of California, district officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Advanced Placement and English as a Second Language instruction will probably 
be available, but shop classes and interscholastic sports won't be offered. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials stress that Evening High School will be unlike Allan F. 
Daily High in Glendale, a continuation school where students with disciplinary 
problems and bad attendance records are assigned. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening high school will accommodate between 200 and 600 students, though 
district officials say a minimum of 200 to 250 is needed for the first year. 
Otherwise, the school might not open and in its place less desirable options, 
such as installing portable classrooms, may be adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 The student-to-teacher ratio in Glendale schools is presently 32-to-1. 
Initially, a district spokesman said, it will probably remain the same at 
Evening High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Away from the classroom, students will be able to create most of the 
extracurricular activities they want, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At other schools, for example, clubs meet during lunch or at the end of the 
day. Students at the evening school will have similar choices to gather during 
dinner break, and before and after classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the program succeeds or fails depends largely on how well everyone 
involved adapts to the change, some say. 
</P>
<P>
 "So much of this is related to how the community feels it can best address the 
problems of overcrowding," said Harry Handler, former superintendent of Los 
Angeles public schools, now an adjunct professor of education at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a key point here: It is voluntary," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Los Angeles Unified School District began year-round programs at 
schools in the late 1970s, Handler said, there was concern from many people 
about how well it would work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eventually what tends to happen is that, over time, people working together 
generate solutions to problems," he said. "While the problems don't go away, 
the problems are identified . . . and changes become advantages." 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers and administrators in Glendale cite several advantages students have 
in attending school late in the day: the chance to hold part-time jobs in the 
morning, easier access to school supplies such as computers, and the ability to 
come to class wide awake. 
</P>
<P>
 As Glendale School Board President Sharon Beauchamp put it, "Young people are 
just like adults. There are day young people, and there are night young 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 It is the idea of "night young people" that has some neighbors of Hoover High 
School worried about continuous noise and traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a problem with the concept of it," said Madeleine Hibbs, 45, a 
mother of two who lives across the street from the campus. "This could well be 
the perfect solution for us. My concern is if this will be at Hoover High. I 
don't know what the profile of these students is going to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Hibbs said she would not send her young children, ages 5 and 9, to an evening 
campus when they reach high school age. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent survey of 719 parents and 1,182 students in eighth, ninth and 10th 
grades indicates that 76% of parents would not send their children to evening 
high school, and 67% of students do not want to go. 
</P>
<P>
 One parent, Susan Nowicke, told the task force she wanted to stop the program 
because she feared that students will not learn as much at night and won't see 
their families at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids are not disciplined enough to get up and get their studies done," 
the 33-year-old mother of two said. "They'll go to bed and get up whenever they 
happen to get up." 
</P>
<P>
 If this was any other type of poll, the negative ratings would surely be 
disheartening. 
</P>
<P>
 But Glendale school officials quickly point out that 302 students showed an 
interest in attending -- more than enough for Evening High School to open as 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of operating and staffing the school for the next five years is 
estimated at $894,125, or about $135,000 more than the price for installing 
portable classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need to go back and ask the question, 'Is there any reason why facilities 
should only be used during the day and not be in operation on weekends and at 
night?' " said district Supt. Robert Sanchis. 
</P>
<P>
 About a decade ago, the Los Angeles Unified School District had a converse 
experience from Glendale's. Los Angeles school officials considered opening 
evening high schools, but determined that few students would want to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the district uses busing and year-round programs to alleviate crowding 
and offers high school students the option of taking some of their classes in 
the day and others at night in adult education facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows for sure how many evening high schools are open in California 
because districts are not required to notify the state Department of Education 
or any other agency about it. 
</P>
<P>
 The only state requirements for opening such a school are that no one under 
the ninth grade can be enrolled; parental permission is mandatory; and a 
certain amount of time in the school day must be reserved for instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no law that says (high school) has to take place during a certain 
time of day," said Susie Lange, a spokeswoman for the state Department of 
Education. "Our opinion is this is what local control is designed for." 
</P>
<P>
 Evening high schools in other states have attracted a mix of students ranging 
from overachievers to potential dropouts. 
</P>
<P>
 In Las Vegas, Sunset High School was created 22 years ago in order to curb the 
drop-out rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Some teen-agers, Principal Frank Roqueni said, "had a hard time getting up at 
5 o'clock in the morning to catch the bus. Pretty soon they're getting kicked 
out of school for missing first period." 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually, the concept of evening education piqued the interest of students 
looking for more personal attention, Roqueni said. Now, the high school's 700 
to 800 students say that is the No. 1 reason why they attend night classes. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lacey, Wash., near the state capital of Olympia, River Ridge High School 
becomes New Century High for about 200 night students. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen-year-old Desiree Monroy does her homework either after school, at 
about 9 p.m., or first thing in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learn a lot more," she said. "I don't sleep through classes anymore. I'm 
more alert by that time. I've already been up for most of the day so by the 
time I get to school, I'm ready to get going." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover High School Principal Don Duncan visited Sunset and New Century high 
schools in October, 1993, and last May to learn more about them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially, the biggest challenge is to show students the advantage of going 
to school at night," Duncan said. "This is not a continuation school. . . . 
That is not what this is."

GREETER OFFERS WAVES OF FRIENDSHIP; NEIGHBORS: CHRIS SEPULVEDA HAS BECOME AN 
INSTITUTION FROM HIS SPOT IN DOWNTOWN MOORPARK. ILLNESS HASN'T DAMPENED HIS 
ENTHUSIASM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It used to be that just about everybody who drove through Moorpark got a tip 
of the hat or a wave from Chris Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
 About eight years ago, the former infantry soldier and retired postal worker 
appointed himself the unofficial greeter of downtown Moorpark. Standing on the 
corner of Spring Road and 2nd Street each morning and afternoon, he'd give a 
friendly nod to the passersby -- sometimes as many as 500 in an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the go-go years before California 118 was diverted away from 
downtown and an interchange was built on the east side of town. Traffic isn't 
what it used to be, and neither is Sepulveda, who's now 67. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, you don't see too many cars come by anymore," he said, tapping the 
artificial leg he got about a year ago after he lost his own to diabetes. "I 
guess I'm out here more for myself now." 
</P>
<P>
 Sepulveda knows some people wonder what his gimmick is. But there is no 
gimmick. He just likes waving to people, and he likes it when they wave back. 
</P>
<P>
 About eight years ago, just after his wife died, he got bored and fed up with 
sitting on the couch at home and watching TV. He'd much rather sit on the chair 
he has locked to a fence post on the street corner and watch the world drive 
by. 
</P>
<P>
 "People tell me that I make their day, and I tell them that when they wave 
back, they make my day," said Sepulveda, who has lived in Moorpark since 1935. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's wonderful," Anne Briggs said from behind the wheel of her Volvo station 
wagon, stopped at the corner. Her three young children nodded in agreement, 
while they waved to Sepulveda. "He's there almost every morning and every 
night. We really miss him when he's not around." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, worsening diabetes sent him to the Veterans Hospital. Doctors had to 
amputate his right leg below the knee. He had almost lost his foot in World War 
II to frostbite while fighting with Gen. George S. Patton's division in 
Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just lost my toes then, this time they got my whole foot and some of the 
leg too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was almost 18 months before he was able to walk to the street again and 
dispense his daily greetings. But he has a new spot now, closer to where he 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 He sits at the corner of Roberts Avenue and Spring, which is half a block from 
the house he shares with one of his daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 Two lifelong friends bought him a folding chair to sit on. It's permanently 
padlocked to a post next to a stop sign at the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sepulveda went into the hospital, people missed him, Briggs said. She 
never knew Sepulveda's name, but waved to him anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 During his absence, many townsfolk worried that he might have died or suffered 
a stroke, Briggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I didn't want to come out here with my wheelchair, it didn't look so 
good, you know," he said. "My gosh, they seemed to really miss me when I was 
gone, though." 
</P>
<P>
 About six months ago, he toddled to his corner on a temporary prosthetic leg. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not too good, see," he said, showing how the leg is a little too short 
and makes him uneasy on his feet. "The doctor said he was almost finished 
making another. I told him not to rush it, and just make sure it's good enough 
for me to dance on. I like dancing." 
</P>
<P>
 People still worry about him. They drop by and give him sodas or ice cream 
when the temperature climbs close to 100. Once he fell asleep and a worried 
driver stopped to make sure he was OK. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wouldn't leave until she knew for sure that I was all right," he said. 
"She wanted to call an ambulance, but I was just a little sleepy." 
</P>
<P>
 He says now he's back, doing what he does best. He has it down to a science -- 
a gentle wave with a cupped hand, a slightly tilted head and open mouth smile. 
</P>
<P>
 He even throws in a wink now and again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know him," he says, waving to an elderly man riding in the passenger seat 
of a blue Lincoln Continental. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poor man. He's crippled. He doesn't get out much. I told his wife when I get 
my new leg, I'd take him out and push him around in his wheelchair," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know how that is sitting around the house. It can drive you crazy."

REHEATING THE GRIDIRON; CHAPMAN UNIVERSITY DECIDES 62 YEARS WITHOUT A TEAM IS 
ENOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The last time the Chapman Panthers football team ran out onto a field, 
Franklin D. Roosevelt had just been elected and the New Deal promised relief to 
a nation mired in the Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty-two years later, players will once again don helmets and pads and march 
onto the gridiron this September. This time, the team will play home games in 
Orange -- not Los Angeles -- and will no longer carry its old name of 
California Christian. 
</P>
<P>
 Boosters are quick to mention that the Chapman Panthers will become the only 
NCAA football squad in Orange County when they battle the Whittier College 
Poets on Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few problems, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Most team members haven't met each other yet. A recently ordered scoreboard 
remains to be installed. And someone's going to have to tutor the university 
president on the intricacies of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may have to read a rule book," President James L. Doti said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bigger question is whether the 2,900 Chapman University students -- 
few of whom are aware of the long-lost football heritage -- will rally behind 
the team with the school spirit normally associated with the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do we have a school fight song?" Athletic Director David Currey asked 
himself. "We don't even have a school fight." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so maybe it's going to be harder than they thought. But team supporters 
said they're ready to make Chapman's first football season in Division III -- 
the NCAA small college category -- a memorable one by involving 100 new 
football players and the rest of the student body. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe this isn't the most significant thing in history," said Coach Ken 
Visser, "but for a football player, it's pretty exciting to be a part of 
something that hasn't existed in 62 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Sports psychologists said there are several factors that can rally students 
and alumni behind a team: image, marketing, tradition and, of course, winning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apathy is a function of poor performance," explained Dr. Robert Schleser, 
director of the Center for Sport Performance Psychology in Chicago. "An 
institution with history and tradition can sustain losing better than a new 
program." 
</P>
<P>
 If the team doesn't win, some people think fans will quickly lose interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have clients who say, 'Yeah, I hear you got a football team,' and they 
smirk and laugh," said Jennifer Trammell, 23, a hairstylist and English student 
at Chapman. "They expect them to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Trammell said she plans to attend the games, which will be free to students 
and faculty. Tickets for others will cost $5. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a revenue sport -- it's a participation sport," said Currey, 
adding that it will cost the university about $200,000 to field the team. None 
of the players will receive scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the way it was years and years ago," Currey said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the experts see it, creating nostalgia and spirit is part of football's 
traditional role in Americana and college life. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things that's distinctive about American colleges and universities 
is this notion of school spirit," said Mike Oriard, an English professor at 
Oregon State University who played football at Notre Dame and for the Kansas 
City Chiefs. "Here we think of college as a way of life for four years, an 
experience not just in curriculum but in athletics and its spinoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman administrators hope to start one tradition by having the football 
players tap the head of a donated $8,000 bronze panther sculpture on campus 
before each Saturday game. At some colleges, players tap signs or pray together 
in special alcoves. 
</P>
<P>
 Chants, events like homecoming, and rituals such as Florida State University's 
"Tomahawk Chop" are other customs that help fans identify with a team. 
Marketing can also help. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chapman bookstore manager James Clement said there so far have been 
lackluster sales of the football-themed shirts he began stocking in late 
spring. The store also has large red Chapman flags available, "but you don't 
find too many people with flagpoles," Clement said. 
</P>
<P>
 He expects sales to pick up when new sweat shirts and other items arrive in 
the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The spirit's already here," Clement said. "Having a football team's really 
going to boost it." 
</P>
<P>
 Trammell, a member of the Alpha Phi sorority, plans to be a part of any spirit 
activities that form around the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "But (administrators) need to promote the team more," the Anaheim Hills 
resident said. "It's a private school and really well-known, but not for 
sports." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, Athletic Director Currey had a unique Chapman football 
item on his desk that may whip up some spirit during the countdown to the 
opening day. 
</P>
<P>
 A black plastic digital watch marked with a red "C" -- destined to go to 
selected people in the Chapman community -- lay in its box, but the words on 
its face were visible: 33 days till Panther football . 
</P>
<P>
 Visser, the coach, thinks location will help the team. "We're in Orange 
County, and Orange County loves football," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's Doti, Chapman's president and an economist, who came up with the 
idea of reviving the sport even though the two schools he attended -- the 
University of Chicago and the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle -- had 
no football teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Doti and other administrators moved the school's athletics program from 
Division II, where its teams faced larger schools, to Division III in 1992 -- 
much to the dismay of some in the athletic department. That meant no more 
scholarships, but it also meant that two new men's sports and five new women's 
sports could be added because the department had more money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we're the only game in town," Doti said. Neither UC Irvine nor Cal State 
Fullerton, the two largest Orange County universities, have intercollegiate 
football programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton physical education professor Kenneth Ravizza said he 
doubts Chapman will be able to rally large numbers of students to support its 
team. Cal State Fullerton disbanded its Division I football team in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Division III schools, their quality of entertainment isn't good," 
Ravizza said. "But they're not there to entertain the fans, they're there to 
provide opportunity for a student athlete." 
</P>
<P>
 One sports historian called Division III football closer to the "pristine 
ideal" of the sport. Currey agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to bring back the days when you studied, and you played for fun," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doti said alumni and others who attend his speeches on economics regularly 
approach him and "instead of asking about inflation, they say, 'Are you really 
going to have a good team?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Banners soon to be strung throughout campus and in the streets of downtown 
Orange will remind the community of the first home game on Sept. 24, Chapman 
spokeswoman Ruth Wardwell said. Those attending are scheduled to get Chapman 
seat cushions. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Chapman moved to its current campus from Los Angeles in 1954, its 
stadium has never seen college football. The field is set to be striped for the 
first time this morning by a grounds crew from Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Novelty likely will draw fans to the 3,000-seat stadium at first, officials 
said. As a precaution, they have rented grandstands used at the Rose Parade and 
Long Beach Grand Prix in case attendance exceeds the stadium's capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 On opening day, though, there will not be the horns and drumbeats of a loud 
university marching band. A pep band of music students from Chapman is still in 
its formative stages, Currey said, and the recent departure of the school's 
cheerleading adviser also has left officials unsure whether a pep squad can be 
ready for the opener. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't built a brand new stadium or fancy chair backs," Currey said. "We 
haven't got fancy brochures or season tickets or deluxe boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we do have is a college team that's going to run out onto the field and 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 And there will be one nostalgic touch to the game: Ernie Chapman, 84, 
reportedly the last living player from 1930s Chapman football, will handle the 
coin toss to determine which team kicks off. He is the son of university 
founder Charles C. Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
 "How's that for tradition?" Wardwell asked.

PROPERTY MANAGER ACCUSED OF EMBEZZLING; CRIME: INVESTIGATORS SAY JIM FITZGERALD 
TOOK $340,000 FROM TWO HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS IN ORANGE COUNTY BY OPENING A 
SHAM ACCOUNT AND CREATING PHONY INVOICES. 
</P>

<P>
 The dancers at Captain Cream, a topless club in a Lake Forest shopping center, 
knew Jim Fitzgerald as a big spender. He could be seen at the club several days 
a week, dropping as much as $500 in a few hours on tips and drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 But that cash may have been the dues money of hundreds of Laguna Niguel 
homeowners, for whom Fitzgerald worked as the property manager of two homeowner 
associations, law enforcement investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald, who was arrested in the parking lot of Captain Cream's in June, is 
in jail awaiting a preliminary hearing on charges that he embezzled about 
$340,000 in homeowner association funds while he was vice president of 
Seabreeze Management Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald, 45, says he is innocent and broke. He is represented by a public 
defender. 
</P>
<P>
 But sheriff's investigator Donald Lambert says Fitzgerald stole the money and 
then spent the bulk of it on "wine, women and song." 
</P>
<P>
 Since November, 1991, Fitzgerald had been funneling money out of the bank 
accounts of Camden Court Homeowners Assn., representing 188 townhomes, and the 
Niguel Ranch Homeowners Assn., which maintains slopes and greenbelts for a 
1,200-unit community, according to sheriff's investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 He is suspected of forging the names of association directors on bank 
signature cards he placed on file with the Bank of Newport, where the 
associations kept their reserve accounts. Then, unbeknown to the associations, 
he created bank accounts in their names at the Bank of Yorba Linda, according 
to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald transferred funds from the Bank of Newport to the Bank of Yorba 
Linda, where he put his own name on the signature cards so he could sign on the 
accounts and withdraw money for his personal use, including paying off credit 
cards, the district attorney alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 But nobody, including the auditor in his annual review, discovered anything 
was amiss until May 10, when Lisa Dale, the owner of Seabreeze, went to the 
Laguna Niguel branch of the Bank of Newport to apply for a car loan and noticed 
a $4,000 cashier's check on the desk of the business accounts officer that was 
made out to the Camden Court Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 She became suspicious when she was told that Fitzgerald had requested the 
check to pay vendors, especially because Fitzgerald was not assigned to handle 
the bank account and vendors were paid from other funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Anxious to get to the bottom of this, Dale said, she began reviewing the 
association's financial records. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four employees and I took files to my house and did a review of the books, 
and indeed we saw several like transactions," she said. "It was apparent that 
there indeed was a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "At 1 a.m. I felt that I had irrefutable evidence a crime was committed and 
called the Orange County sheriff." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Dale met with sheriff's investigator Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a stroke of luck the way she found out about it," Lambert said. "But I 
think sooner or later, the auditor would have found out about it." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason no one noticed that funds were missing, Lambert said, was that 
Fitzgerald had created phony invoices to look as if the money was used for 
valid expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald's arrest has stung many who knew him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I was raped," said Lester Garb, president of the Niguel Ranch 
Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Garb described Fitzgerald as having a "nice, jovial, ingratiating 
personality." 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney and others say, however, that the Laguna Niguel incident 
illustrates that homeowner associations and the management firms they hire are 
vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowner associations are governed by boards of directors elected from among 
the residents. Because the directors often have other full-time jobs and little 
management experience, they hire professional managers to help them. 
</P>
<P>
 Large sums of money are handled daily by this young and fast-growing form of 
local governance, which has responsibility nationwide for $5 billion stashed in 
reserve accounts for long-range expenses such as roofing, painting and 
emergency repairs, according to the Community Associations Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because associations are a new concept and many people operating them have 
little or no business experience, they are an easy target for professional con 
artists," said Paul Christiansen, a Laguna Niguel real estate broker. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald declined to be interviewed about the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigator Lambert said only $1,000 was in Fitzgerald's bank accounts when 
he was arrested. He "didn't drive fancy cars, and he lived in an apartment in 
Aliso Viejo," Niguel Ranch Assn. President Garb said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lambert said Fitzgerald, the divorced father of a teen-age boy, had been 
on expensive yachting trips in the Caribbean and had spent lavishly on the 
dancers at Captain Cream. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would spend $200 to $500 a day on tips and drinks for them," he said. 
"According to the girls, he liked to play like the big spender." 
</P>
<P>
 If Fitzgerald is convicted, he could go to prison for up to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale has promised to reimburse both homeowner associations for their loss, in 
part by using a $250,000 fidelity bond posted by her firm. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she is not convinced that all the missing money was spent and has 
hired a private investigator to look for it. She said the investigator will 
check into the possibility that stolen money was transferred out of state. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am trying to make a statement through the court system by getting as long a 
prison sentence as possible for Jim Fitzgerald, (one) that will discourage 
property managers anywhere from thinking this kind of crime pays," Dale said.

ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 187; MEXICAN OFFICIAL DENOUNCES BALLOT MEASURE; 
CAMPAIGN: DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS HIS GOVERNMENT WILL WORK WITH FOES OF 
THE PLAN, WHICH WOULD DENY MOST SERVICES TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. INITIATIVE 
BACKER ACCUSES HIM OF INTERFERENCE IN U.S. AFFAIRS. 
</P>

<P>
 A leading Mexican government official has taken the unusual step of publicly 
condemning a California ballot measure, denouncing Proposition 187 -- the 
so-called "Save Our State" initiative -- as a misguided effort that could 
create a Latino underclass and spur discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Deputy Foreign Minister Andres Rozental, speaking Saturday evening 
at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Downtown Los Angeles, declared his 
government's "commitment to work closely" with those opposed to the 
proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican government will make its opposition known to business leaders and 
others, citing potential damage to U.S.-Mexican relations and cross-border 
commerce in the free-trade era, Rozental explained in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversial proposition -- which seeks to force illegal immigrants to 
leave California and discourage others from arriving -- will be on the state 
ballot Nov. 8. It would deny such immigrants public schooling and most publicly 
funded health care and social services, while requiring that police, educators, 
social workers and others report suspected illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Rozental, a senior Foreign Ministry functionary who often addresses 
U.S.-Mexico matters, spoke during presentation of the Mexican government's 
prestigious Aguila Azteca (Aztec Eagle) awards to two prominent Mexican 
Americans, writer Luis Valdez and labor activist Baldemar Velasquez. 
</P>
<P>
 The diplomat's comments mirrored those of U.S. critics who have portrayed the 
far-reaching initiative as perhaps the most virulently anti-immigrant proposal 
to emerge in recent U.S. history. 
</P>

 "We fear the climate of hostility and violent confrontation that may be 
unleashed," Rozental said. "And we also fear the permanent damage that might be 
inflicted on the image of Mexicans and Mexico, both here and at home, which we 
have so painstakingly built up over the recent past." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Mexican authorities have increasingly spoken out on behalf of 
the millions of expatriates residing in the United States, a group that has 
growing influence south of the border and whose remittances back home are one 
of the nation's major income sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Mexican Foreign Ministry harshly criticized Gov. Pete Wilson 
for his pronouncements that illegal immigrants were draining the state's 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 William S. King, a former U.S. Border Patrol chief who was one of the 
architects of Proposition 187, called Rozental's remarks undue interference in 
U.S. affairs. The comments, King said, reflect Mexican authorities' reluctance 
to do anything about illegal immigration and the vast and lucrative 
human-smuggling network. 
</P>
<P>
 "Proposition 187 will pass because the American people are tired of illegal 
immigration," King said.

CAPITOL JOURNAL: CURING THE SUMMERTIME BLAH-BLAHS

 One of the many wonderful things about vacationing at Lake Tahoe for three 
weeks was that I avoided California television and the political ads. I wasn't 
pestered by the nya-nyaing gubernatorial candidates: 
</P>
<P>
 "You broke your promise." "You're lying." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm more against rape than you are." "No you're not, I'm . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that rape isn't an important issue -- rapists should be locked away in a 
dark place for a very long time -- but listening to the candidates, you 
sometimes think rape is the only problem facing California. That, parole 
violations and illegal immigration. And the solution to everything is the death 
penalty or ridding the state of Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 It all gets jumbled into one whiny blah. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tahoe, nobody seemed a bit interested in Gov. Wilson or Treasurer Brown. 
This was vacation time. And the talk was about Mackinaw bites, glassy water, 
buoy space and hot slots at the casinos. Change the locale and subjects -- 
beach fog, scenic trails, park campsites, swim tournaments -- and I suspect the 
same was true all over California. The candidates were being tuned out. 
</P>
<P>
 There is evidence of this in a Field poll. It shows that, despite all their 
campaigning, each candidate actually lost voter support between mid-May and 
mid-July. Brown dropped by six points and Wilson by three, leaving her ahead by 
five. Undecided rose by nine. (44%-39%-17%.) 
</P>
<P>
 So in one sense, their negative campaigning was successful: Each bloodied the 
other. But they didn't score points for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 With Wilson already the most unpopular California governor of modern times, 
according to polls, one wonders just how weak Brown thinks an opponent has to 
be before she can beat him. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic nominee any day now will change her strategy and begin running 
"positive" TV ads, according to insiders. The spots will talk about family 
things -- good jobs, good schools, affordable colleges and homes -- and the 
middle class not getting its fair share. She'll speak of her vision for 
California's future. 
</P>
<P>
 It's about time, say critics. "She's not saying why people should vote for 
her," laments one Democratic pro in the Capitol. "She ought to ignore Pete 
Wilson. . . . She's been monotonous and boring." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's summer strategy so far has been to remind voters why they don't like 
Wilson. On his watch, she notes, California has lost half a million jobs, taxes 
have been raised a record amount, school programs have been cut, college fees 
increased and the state has fallen deeply into debt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found that many people had forgotten why they dislike him," says Steve 
Glazer, a Brown adviser. "They'd say, 'I just don't.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson skillfully has lured Brown into fighting primarily on his turf: 
crime. He'd jab her and she'd feel obliged to counterpunch in a brawl she 
couldn't win. Perhaps no Democratic woman could, particularly one opposed to 
capital punishment. "I love it," says a Wilson strategist. "My horse owns that 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides, of course, are guilty of shameless distortion. And the issues they 
emphasize -- too often their positions, as well -- are cynically plucked from 
polls and tested with focus groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither candidate is talking seriously about how they'd handle such critical 
problems as education (this should be Brown's strong suit), water, the 
environment or transportation. You don't hear much about restructuring 
government and the tax system. Nobody's really saying how they'd pay for all 
those promised new prisons. But Wilson incredibly has suggested a tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are crying in frustration for the debate to be elevated," says GOP 
activist Steven A. Merksamer, former Gov. George Deukmejian's chief of staff. 
"If it's not, the public's going to be further turned off and the problems 
aren't going to be solved. . . . What has more direct impact on most people's 
lives ultimately -- water or the death penalty?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Such talk is considered naive by political consultants. Pundits may clamor for 
a discussion of ideas, they say, but voters respond mainly to attack politics. 
Maybe they're right. Perhaps it was the weather that kept 65% of registered 
voters home in June, resulting in the lowest turnout for a state election in 78 
years. But I have a hunch many people just were uninspired by the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 One campaign reform we need is a mandatory summer vacation for all candidates. 
Call a truce. That would reduce the need for campaign money and pare 
special-interest influence. Candidates could relax, clear their heads and think 
about what they'd really do in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters would get a respite from the babble. They should tell candidates, "Take 
a hike. Don't come back until after Labor Day."

GOVERNMENT WANTS TO TEACH BRAZILIANS THAT IF THEY SHOP TILL THEY DROP, THEN 
PRICES MAY TOO; ECONOMY: INFLATION TAUGHT CONSUMERS TO BUY FAST, BEFORE MONEY 
LOST VALUE. NOW THEY'RE BEING TOLD TO LOOK FOR BEST DEALS. 
</P>

 As Teresa Catramby, a 28-year-old assistant hotel manager, wound through the 
aisles of blenders, stereos, sofas, comforters and other merchandise at a 
downtown store, it never dawned on her that a lot of powerful people around 
Brazil, even the world, are paying close attention to such consumer excursions. 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians, business leaders, foreign investors and others want to know if a 
buyer like this mother of two will look at newspaper ads before leaving home, 
buy a toaster without checking the price next door or pay high interest rates 
to buy on credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Many, most notably Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero, are hoping that Catramby 
and her fellow consumers can quickly learn how to do something that is second 
nature to most Americans but that Brazilians haven't done for nearly 20 years: 
comparison shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last week, Ricupero spent 10 minutes in a nationally televised speech 
lecturing the nation's 155 million residents on the art of shopping. "Seek the 
lowest prices and the best-made goods," he said. He advised against making 
large purchases on credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Brazilians can acquire this skill in the next few months is a key 
factor in whether the world's eighth-largest economy will be able to right 
itself, vanquish spiraling inflation and realize the economic promise that 
seemed assured 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil is embarking on its sixth economic plan in eight years in its latest 
effort to conquer inflation, which has been running at more than 1,000% 
annually for years. Prices jumped 50% in June alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The country has changed its currency, exchanging the cruzeiro for the real, 
which is pegged to the U.S. dollar. The plan's success, economists say, is 
largely dependent on whether the government can cap a burgeoning deficit and 
keep a tight rein on the nation's money supply. 
</P>
<P>
 Also vital is whether Brazil can switch from an economy in which price-gouging 
merchants lead consumers around by their noses to one in which savvy shoppers 
force retailers to compete for their dollars and thus keep prices relatively 
stable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, we have to change the attitude of government, but we also have to change 
the behavior of merchants," said Amaury de Souza, a sociologist and political 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where Catramby comes in. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, as skyrocketing inflation caused prices to change monthly, 
weekly and even daily, the concept of comparison shopping was virtually 
eliminated from the Brazilian psyche. Consumers developed a "buy now" attitude, 
because prices were sure to go up, not down. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have very high inflation, you must spend very fast because your 
wages will be devaluing very fast," said economist Helio Portocarrero, a 
university professor. "Shopping (for the best price) was simply too expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, market analysts say, the corner merchant developed an almost 
monopolistic power over consumers that often bordered on extortion. "You'd go 
into a store and the salesman would say, 'You'd better buy it now because the 
price is going to go up tomorrow,' " said Paulo Levy, researcher for the 
government's Institute for Applied Economic Research. "He was probably lying, 
but you never knew. So you bought." 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants constantly hoisted prices, partly to adjust for inflation and partly 
because dizzied consumers could never get a sense of what products were really 
worth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to buy milk from a woman and I thought I was paying very little, 
because she sold it out of her home with no overhead," said Armando Castelar, 
assistant planning director for the state-owned Brazilian National Economic and 
Social Development Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, since the economy has stabilized, I realize that I was paying 25% more 
than the price at the market just downstairs. But I never realized that. If you 
asked me what the price of the milk was, I couldn't even tell you. Nobody knew 
the price of anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Prices routinely rose at the beginning of the month, when the vast majority of 
Brazilians get paid. Consumers rushed out and loaded up on whatever they could 
afford. 
</P>
<P>
 "You had no choice," Catramby said. "You would buy for the whole month and 
just store everything you could in the house. Everybody did it. If you didn't, 
your money would be worth less the next week." 
</P>
<P>
 Market equilibrium disappeared. Prices for the same product could double from 
one block to the next. 
</P>
<P>
 That was before the July 1 introduction of the real. Since then, inflation has 
been at a standstill. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has been trying to explain to Brazilians that they now have 
shopping options. Even before the plan went into effect, Ricupero had gone on 
television urging consumers to shop, shop, shop for the best prices. 
</P>
<P>
 And when merchants parked prices at penthouse levels just before the currency 
swap, Mariangela Sarrubbo, director of a federal watchdog agency, suggested 
that customers boycott those stores. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, consumer response to the new market conditions has been mixed. 
Customers are more price-conscious, merchants say. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are more careful with their money," said Carlos Roberto, manager of a 
medium-sized department store downtown. "They are looking for sales. They are 
looking for deals." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now people are going from store to store," said Peixoto Sousa, a linen and 
bedding salesman at another store. "If they don't like our prices, they go to 
another store." 
</P>
<P>
 That has caused some merchants to become more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been spending a lot of time comparing our prices to those of other 
stores," said Ramone Neto, owner of a large fabric store that sells to both 
consumers and retailers. "We've been lowering prices to see if it will get more 
customers in the store." 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Cosenedey, co-owner of a notions store, hasn't lowered his prices, but 
he is making other concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "See this bag," he said, pointing to hundreds of sewing pins bunched inside 
clear plastic wrapping. "They sell for one real each. If you buy 10, I'll sell 
them to you for eight reals. I didn't do that before." 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, prices have edged down about 1.5%, according to government 
reports, and many stores are offering discounts of up to 30%. The cost of basic 
foods has fallen 5.7% and would have declined more if two frosts in late June 
and early July hadn't damaged fruit and vegetable crops, government officials 
said. Overall, however, prices are still inflated and will fall further if 
Brazilians shop wisely, Ricupero said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest transition for Brazilians, say economists and sociologists, will 
be learning to develop a long-term view of their buying power, holding on to 
their money until they find the right price. 
</P>
<P>
 That concept hasn't completely sunk in. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Valentem, 62, was browsing among stereo systems at one store. He had been 
to five others already but had not considered delaying his purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the way I've always done it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Ester, 20, a student, was looking at athletic shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I really haven't changed the way I shop," she said. "I just buy it when I 
need it and try to get the best price that day." 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants are taking advantage of such attitudes by keeping prices high on 
big-ticket items such as appliances, electronics and furniture but offering 
extended payment plans -- with exorbitant interest rates. Their customers are 
actually paying more for the products now than they did before the new economic 
plan went into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the 12-month payment plan, the cost of a blender goes from $34 to $90, a 
$400 stereo to $1,200. Yet people are loading up .  
</P>
<P>
 "The client likes knowing that their payment will be the same every month," 
appliance salesman Evesio Silveira said. "In the old days, you never knew what 
it would be because you had to factor in inflation, which changed from month to 
month. So even though (the price is now) higher, people are buying." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, says economist Portocarrero, many customers assume that because 
the payments are stable, they are getting a good deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not everybody is very conscious about financial mathematics," he said, "but I 
think people will learn over time." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the rush, Levy said, is the result of a pent-up demand for credit in 
any form. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under high inflation, you'd buy things even if you didn't need them just to 
get rid of the money," Levy said. "Clothes, groceries, small items. Many things 
you needed, you couldn't afford them. Now that you have this alternative, 
buying them in 10 or 12 installments, you can budget around that." 
</P>
<P>
 Catramby thinks people will catch on. She did. 
</P>
<P>
 Catramby lived briefly in the United States before returning to Brazil six 
months ago. In her first two months in the United States, she said, she bought 
just as she had in Brazil, rushing out with each paycheck to load up on 
groceries. 
</P>
<P>
 "But then I saw that's not the way you do it," she said. "You wait for sales. 
You use coupons. You go and buy what you need, but you hold back some money and 
then you come back the next week when the prices are maybe better. It just 
takes time to adjust." A Price Comparison

ENVIRONMENT; HUNT IS ON FOR POLLUTANT TRACES IN BERING SEA; ALASKA VILLAGERS, 
SCIENTISTS WONDER IF TOXIC SUBSTANCES ARE ENDANGERING ANIMALS AND PEOPLE WHO 
EAT THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HULEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five or six miles from shore, in the slushy subarctic wilderness of the Bering 
Sea, three Inupiat hunters stand on an iceberg and prepare to butcher an 
eight-foot-long bearded seal. They had shot the animal minutes earlier from 
their aluminum skiff, and climbed onto the ice to retrieve it. 
</P>
<P>
 For generations, scenes like this have played out up and down the Alaska 
coastline. Hunts for seals, walruses and whales are the mainstays of 
still-thriving subsistence cultures in dozens of indigenous settlements, with 
hundreds of animals taken each year. 
</P>
<P>
 But this hunt is different. And as the men set to work, they do something 
that's becoming a modern-day tradition for some of Alaska's native hunters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jack, why don't you be the doctor?" suggests one of the men, Charlie Johnson. 
His 32-year-old nephew, Jack Johnson, nods. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he slips on a pair of rubber gloves, wipes clean a titanium-blade knife 
and begins cutting tissue samples from the seal to be sent off and tested for 
PCBs, DDT and nearly 50 other industrial and agricultural pollutants that have 
begun turning up in small amounts in northern seas. 
</P>
<P>
 If this seal is like other marine mammals tested off Alaska in recent years, 
it won't be a question of whether there are poisons in its blubber and internal 
organs. The question -- asked increasingly by villagers, scientists and 
government agencies -- is how much, and whether the substances are dangerous to 
the animals and the people who consume them. 
</P>
<P>
 The hunters were accompanied by Paul Becker, a Maryland-based scientist from 
the National Marine Fisheries Service. Becker has been coming out with native 
hunters like this since 1987, collecting samples for a national marine mammal 
tissue bank. He has trained several groups of villagers in Nome, Barrow and 
other settlements to take samples as part of their regular hunts. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker and other scientists are just beginning to amass enough samples to 
reach a conclusion: Many different man-made contaminants are turning up in 
marine mammals in the farthest reaches of Earth, including the Arctic. 
Researchers in Canada and Greenland are reporting the same thing. Among the 
most common are pesticides and PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, used in 
electrical equipment and in the manufacture of paints and plastics that have 
been linked with cancer and reproductive problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Such substances have long been found in waterways and oceans at lower 
latitudes. Scientists think that they are drifting here on atmospheric and 
ocean currents from near and far. Air and water currents in the Arctic tend to 
trap contaminants on the polar icecap, scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
 The concentrations turning up here are generally low -- for the most part well 
under amounts typically found in seals and sea lions in more industrialized 
areas, such as off the coast of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The contaminants collect in water and in mud on the sea bottom and travel up 
the food chain. The highest amounts turn up in some of the larger sea mammals, 
such as beluga whales and polar bears, which have relatively long lives and 
tend to concentrate toxins in their fat and internal organs. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this has caused no small amount of anxiety in the villages, where oil 
from rendered seal fat is a staple consumed like salad dressing and where 
people routinely dine on dishes such as dried seal meat, walrus heart and whale 
steaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's definitely a lot of concerns in the villages," said Charlie Johnson, 
who is also executive director of the Eskimo Walrus Commission, a native group 
that works with the government to help manage Pacific walrus populations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen a huge increase in cancer rates. People hear about these things 
turning up and wonder if that has anything to do with it. I don't think there's 
enough known yet to say there's a problem here in Alaska . . . but I think we 
have to be aware that we could have a problem eventually," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Public health agencies have consistently held that toxins in Alaska marine 
mammals are at such low levels that there's little risk to people -- or 
whatever risks exist are outweighed by the benefits of eating such foods. A 
team from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tested elders from two 
indigenous communities who had eaten walrus and other marine mammals their 
entire lives and found nothing out of the ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker, an ecologist, said he believes that contaminant levels are low enough 
not to be of immediate worry in Alaska, but that could change if levels 
continue rising. 
</P>
<P>
 And health officials here are trying to get money from the federal government 
for stepped-up monitoring for toxins in the villages. They point to Canada, 
Finland and other northern countries, where much more testing has been done -- 
everything from checking breast milk for PCBs to taking hair samples for heavy 
metals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here in the United States, we haven't done squat," said Dr. John Middaugh, 
Alaska's state epidemiologist. "We need to do a lot more work documenting 
what's here and whether it's changing. We need to call attention to the world 
that the Arctic can't tolerate the continued long-term transportation of these 
things into our ecosystems."

SEOUL WILLING TO OFFER N. KOREA NUCLEAR REACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Kim Young Sam offered North Korea a billion-dollar nuclear reactor 
if the North proves it isn't making nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim made the offer today as part of a deal with North Korea to open its 
nuclear facilities to inspections by U.N. officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange, North Korea agreed Saturday at talks in Geneva with U.S. 
diplomats to stop development of its nuclear program until it is under 
international inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 Light-water reactors are regarded as safer than the Soviet-style plants. They 
also make less plutonium -- a fuel for nuclear bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If and when the North guarantees the transparency of its nuclear activities, 
we are ready to support their development of the peaceful use of nuclear 
energy, including light-water reactor construction," Kim said during a ceremony 
marking the 49th anniversary today of Korea's liberation from Japan's 
colonialism in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could well become the very first joint project for national development 
leading to the establishment of a single community of the Korean people," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim emphasized that North Korea must show that its nuclear program is 
peaceful, as it claims, and that it has no military aspects. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea has an advanced nuclear power industry, with nine reactors in 
operation, and can manufacture light-water reactors on its own. Such a reactor 
takes up to 10 years to build and costs about $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the deal, the North also promised not to reprocess 8,000 spent 
nuclear fuel rods, removed from a reactor in May. Reprocessing the rods could 
give the North enough plutonium to make five or six bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for the South Korean reactor, the South Korean president said, the 
rival government in Pyongyang must also open nuclear facilities to southern 
inspectors under a 1992 agreement calling for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.

ZEDILLO SAYS HE'LL WIN WITHOUT FRAUD

 Vowing a new age of federalism and reform, ruling party presidential hopeful 
Ernesto Zedillo told more than 100,000 cheering supporters at his final rally 
in the capital Sunday that he will win next week's crucial elections without 
fear or fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The 42-year-old economist, echoing the main theme of his five-month campaign 
beneath a 50-foot hot-air balloon bearing his name, said the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party that has been in power for more than six decades represents 
the only choice for stability in times of uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 "We represent unity -- not confrontation," he said, suggesting that he is the 
best choice because the safest change is one that comes from within. "We 
advocate a democracy strengthened by a genuine division of powers, where 
centralism will be replaced by a new federalism." 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo, who is leading his two main rivals by wide margins in several 
national polls, has had the shortest time to campaign. He was selected by the 
ruling party after its original candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio, was 
assassinated during a Tijuana campaign rally in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Security on Sunday was tight in the historic Zocalo, with dozens of bodyguards 
in dark suits flanking the stage to protect Zedillo. The candidate staged his 
capital city finale in the same square where, just a day earlier, his two chief 
rivals had called on tens of thousands of their supporters to end the ruling 
party's 65-year monopoly on power. 
</P>
<P>
 Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, whom the opinion polls showed running second but 
who could benefit from the large number of undecided voters, had urged his 
supporters Saturday to use their vote for a "peaceful and democratic change" 
that would turn out a ruling party he called "the world's oldest oligarchy." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not a leap into the darkness that we propose but a leap into freedom 
and democracy," he said under banners bearing the name of his conservative 
National Action Party and his campaign slogan, "The only secure change." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Saturday, as hundreds of doves released by supporters of his leftist 
Democratic Revolutionary Party circled overhead, third-place hopeful Cuauhtemoc 
Cardenas vowed a campaign of nonviolent protest if the elections are tainted by 
ruling party fraud. Cardenas, the son of beloved former President Lazaro 
Cardenas, believes he was cheated out of the presidency through massive fraud 
during the last elections in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't tolerate another . . . unelected government like the current one. We 
won't be humiliated and ridiculed," he shouted to a crowd observers estimated 
at 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to such concerns, the government of President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari has sponsored a vast array of election reforms this year that he has 
vowed will make Sunday's elections the cleanest and fairest in Mexico's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 45.7 million registered voters will cast ballots under the watchful 
eyes of tens of thousands of independent, trained monitors -- including, for 
the first time, several hundred foreigners and a U.N. election team. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the president, voters will elect a 500-member Chamber of 
Deputies, 98 senators and two state governors. The most hotly contested 
gubernatorial race is in the southern state of Chiapas, where a New Year's Day 
uprising by Indian guerrillas has left lingering fears about the coming polls.

IT'S SAFE TO RETURN HOME, RWANDA OFFICIALS TELL HUTUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three ministers of the new Tutsi-led Rwandan government paid an unprecedented 
visit to the French protected "safe zone" in southwest Rwanda on Sunday to tell 
frightened Hutu refugees it was safe to return home. 
</P>
<P>
 But their emotional appeal was met with skepticism and outright hostility by 
the refugees, even as French protectors vowed to pull out of the zone by a 
scheduled Aug. 22 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 The cold reaction to the ministers indicated that fear and mistrust are still 
preventing hundreds of thousands of refugees, in neighboring Zaire or under 
French protection, from returning to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior Minister Seth Sendashonga, Repatriation Minister Jacques Bihozagara 
and Public Works Minister Charles Ntakirutenka flew from Kigali aboard a U.N. 
helicopter to Kibuye, at the northern edge of the French-held safe haven. 
</P>
<P>
 There, they met local leaders and later talked to about 2,000 people assembled 
at the town's soccer stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came down here to reassure people they can safely go home, that there will 
be no reprisals," Sendashonga told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "People tell me they hear rumors of returnees being massacred," he added. 
"What I say is they should ask those who went to Kigali and returned and rely 
on credible testimonies." 
</P>
<P>
 In Paris, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur said Sunday that his troops will 
pull out of Rwanda by the deadline despite fears of a new exodus of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We said at the end of July that we accepted to put off (withdrawal) to Aug. 
22. We do not intend to extend the deadline beyond that date," he said in a 
radio interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The French-planned departure from the humanitarian and demilitarized zone only 
a week from now, at the end of their two-month U.N. mandate, is causing great 
concern among a population fearing further ethnic massacres. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. and aid agency officials fear a new refugee exodus in southwestern 
Rwanda, but they stressed Sunday that there was no influx yet. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kibuye, they said 3,000 to 5,000 refugees left the town Saturday. They 
headed south for Cyangugu just over the border from the eastern Zairian town of 
Bukavu. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Hutu-led government, which fled to Zaire after it was overthrown by 
the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front, is urging the refugees to leave, 
saying they will be killed by the RPF if they return to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 500,000 people, mostly Tutsis, were killed by government soldiers 
and Hutu death squads before the RPF victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Rwandan government, approved by the RPF, is campaigning with U.N. 
approval to coax the refugees back. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Sendashonga told the crowd listening to him that the Kigali 
authorities are not vengeful, most people laughed at him. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just don't believe him," Kibuye Mayor Augustin Karaba said.

CLINTON ISSUES A CALL FOR PRAYER TO REVIVE HIS STALLED CRIME PACKAGE; 
LEGISLATION: THE PRESIDENT VISITS A CHURCH IN A WASHINGTON SUBURB AND PLEADS 
FOR HELP TO RESURRECT MEASURE DEFEATED IN THE HOUSE LAST WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 President Clinton turned from politics to prayer Sunday in hopes of 
resurrecting his stalled crime package, saying it was the "will of God" that 
lawmakers make citizens "as safe as we possibly can." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton asked for the prayers of 2,000 congregants at a black church in 
Washington's suburbs as he and Democratic leaders in Congress sought a way to 
overcome opposition to the Administration's $33-billion anti-crime measure, 
which was defeated in the House on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a bigger problem than the violence that is eating the heart out 
of this country," Clinton told members of the Full Gospel AME Zion Church in 
Temple Hills, Md. ". . . I ask you to pray and to speak to your friends and 
neighbors and to hope somehow we will all find the wisdom and judgment to come 
back and do the will of God in our ministry, which is to make you as safe as we 
possibly can." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton traveled to church Sunday morning from Camp David, where he spent the 
weekend trying to salvage not only the crime bill but also his sweeping health 
care reform initiative, which has run into major roadblocks that threaten to 
derail it until at least next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our ministry is to do the word of God here on Earth, and that starts with 
giving our children and our families a place in which at least they can be safe 
and secure," Clinton said, his voice raspy and hushed from allergies and 
overuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton admitted that he had been "pretty down" since the bill's defeat, the 
most stinging legislative rebuke of his presidency. But he declared: "We have 
to find a way out of this." 
</P>
<P>
 The President and other White House officials gave no ground on Sunday, 
insisting that they would brook no changes in the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the key elements to be part of this bill," said White House Chief of 
Staff Leon E. Panetta. Those provisions include funds for another 100,000 
police officers, a ban on 19 types of assault weapons and billions of dollars 
for social programs aimed at preventing crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing on the CBS-TV program "Face the Nation," Panetta firmly rejected 
Republican calls to strip the assault-weapons provision out of the bill and 
submit it to a separate vote. Many members of Congress -- including a number of 
the 58 Democrats who voted against the bill -- cited the weapons ban as their 
chief reason for opposing the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us now to give in to the National Rifle Assn. would have the Congress 
basically capitulating to that special interest," Panetta said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's chief antagonist in the House, GOP Whip Newt Gingrich of 
Georgia, said Republicans would be happy to consider a crime bill shorn of the 
assault-weapons ban and several billion dollars in crime prevention programs 
that the GOP considers "pork" for Democratic lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The President) is currently fighting to keep a bill which is weak on crime 
and fat on pork, and he ought to be honest with the American people," Gingrich 
said on ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley." 
</P>
<P>
 In another matter, Senate Democratic leader George J. Mitchell of Maine added 
his voice to those questioning a judicial panel's appointment of Kenneth W. 
Starr to replace independent counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. in the investigation 
of Clinton and some of his subordinates in the Whitewater affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, appearing on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press," said the three-judge panel 
that oversees independent counsels had violated the very standard -- the 
"appearance of independence" -- that it had embraced in removing Fiske, who had 
been appointed by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 Without questioning Starr's ability and integrity, Mitchell noted that Starr 
is "an active Republican" who considered running for the Senate last year. 
Starr is co-chairman of a Republican's congressional campaign, a regular 
contributor to Republican candidates and, when he was solicitor general, a high 
political appointee of the George Bush Administration, Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Without calling on Starr to step down, Mitchell said there "is a very heavy 
burden on him to establish his fairness and independence." 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing on the same show, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) dismissed 
the controversy as an attempt by Clinton's team "to intimidate Starr, trying to 
make it impossible for him to do the right thing."

IDAHO FIRES FORCE EVACUATION ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of two rural vacation communities were told they should evacuate 
Sunday as forest fires stoked by hot, dry wind roared through Idaho forests, 
forcing some firefighters to back off. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fire behavior at its most extreme," fire information officer Faith 
Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several big fires in west-central Idaho had burned to within miles of each 
other, and experts warned that if they joined they could char an area half the 
size of the state of Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire bosses recommended that more than 45 residents of the Idaho resort 
community of Burgdorf Hot Springs and nearby Secesh Meadows get out. The 
residents were offered a chance to leave by convoy as the area was threatened 
by the 30,700-acre Corral Complex in the Payette National Forest, northeast of 
McCall. A complex refers to a group of fires that are burning simultaneously 
but have not joined. 
</P>
<P>
 The Corral Complex threatened a dozen historic structures in Burgdorf Hot 
Springs and an estimated 70 summer homes at Secesh Meadows, Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the houses were old, have flammable roofs and are in hard-to-reach 
areas. "Frankly, a lot of them are simply indefensible," she said.

ASPIRIN REPORTED TO CURB COLON CANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aspirin, which has been shown to help reduce the risk of heart disease, also 
helps prevent colon cancer, a medical journal reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 A study in the Annals of Internal Medicine reported that people who had taken 
aspirin twice or more per week over an extended period were significantly less 
likely to get either colon or rectal cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Colon and rectal cancer are among the most common and deadly forms of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We observed a lower risk for colo-rectal cancers among users of aspirin 
compared with non-users," wrote the authors of the study, conducted by 
researchers at the Harvard Medical School and Boston's Brigham and Women's 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The study found that among those who had taken regular aspirin doses the 
longest -- at least four years -- the relative risk of colon or rectal cancer 
diagnosis was 38% of that of non-aspirin users. 
</P>
<P>
 The study tracked 47,900 male health care professionals who have been taking 
part in a broader heart-disease and cancer project begun in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Its findings provided the strongest evidence to date of the benefits of 
aspirin in preventing colon cancer -- benefits that have been indicated in 
earlier studies, the Annals said in an editorial. 
</P>
<P>
 "With recent developments proving the efficacy of screening, ongoing advances 
in the identification of high-risk groups, and the possibility of risk 
modification by diet and chemo-prevention with aspirin, the prospect for 
decreasing mortality from colo-rectal cancer by preventive approaches seems 
bright," the editorial said. 
</P>
<P>
 The editorial's author, Dr. Harinder Garewal of the Veterans Affairs Medical 
Center in Tucson, said one theory is that the preventive effects of aspirin may 
come from its impact on the production of a class of chemicals that help 
control the circulatory system and growth in humans. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said that theory has not been proved.

 Eight small children, left at home by themselves, died in an early morning 
house fire in Carbondale, Ill.One 8-year-old girl escaped the flames unharmed. 
The victims, all relatives from 5 months to 7 years old, were found dead 
inside, a fire department spokesman said. Camilla Foulks, 25, mother of three 
of the children, had been baby-sitting the others as well. Carbondale Police 
Chief Don Strom said Foulks might have been in a bar when the fire broke out. 
"We have several reports to that effect. We have confirmed some of those, and 
we're continuing to investigate other potential witnesses that might have 
similar information," Strom said.

COMMENTARY; FESTIVAL FALLS SHORT OF DEFINING A GENERATION; POP CULTURE: A FEW 
OF THE NEWER ARTISTS CAPTURED THE SPIRIT OF THE MOSTLY YOUNG FANS. BUT IN THE 
END, MUCH OF THE CONTEMPORARY VISION WAS MUDDIED. 
</P>

<P>
 Twenty-five years after Woodstock, the festival's most evocative image remains 
a young couple photographed while huddled tenderly in a blanket. The emerging 
symbol of Woodstock '94 is a starker one: the Mud People. 
</P>
<P>
 Eager to assert their individuality in an ocean of anonymous concert-goers, 
about 200 fans early in the weekend began frolicking in cold, gooey mud. After 
the rain Saturday afternoon, they were joined in using mud as a badge of honor 
by the hundreds of fans in the "mosh pit" -- the area in front of the main 
stage where young men dance to the music so aggressively that they look like 
footballers in a violent scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
 Seizing on this emerging symbol, Trent Reznor and his band, Nine Inch Nails, 
came on stage Saturday night covered with mud themselves -- a marvelous 
reminder of rock's rebellious roots in a festival widely criticized for too 
many restrictions and too much commercialism. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reznor, one of rock's most creative young talents, took the symbolism 
further, using it to give perspective and focus to the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking like a man relegated to the outskirts of society as he stood on stage 
caked in mud, Reznor dramatized brilliantly the frustration expressed by many 
of the young fans during the weekend. They are tired, they said in interviews, 
of their generation being characterized so frequently by media and parents as 
having little imagination or direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The brooding young man on stage, however, didn't just rely on symbolism. 
</P>
<P>
 In a performance as captivating as the legendary ones from the original 
Woodstock, Reznor unleashed a grinding, yet melodic industrial rock sound that 
is more stark and less hopeful than the music of the late Kurt Cobain. Yet, 
like Cobain's music, Reznor's songs address the darkest uncertainties and fears 
of young people. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking down at the mosh pit, he good-naturedly said at one point between 
songs: "All you miserable, muddy f---heads are all right." 
</P>
<P>
 The words were welcome and liberating for those in the audience that so much 
wanted this festival to step from the shadow of the original Woodstock, helping 
in the process to give their generation greater self-identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad that so much of the rest of the weekend, musically speaking, seemed 
all wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 There were too few artists with the radical, contemporary vision of Reznor -- 
someone who can address today's Woodstock generation with the same eloquence 
and power that such artists as Jimi Hendrix, the Who, Creedence Clearwater 
Revival and Sly & the Family Stone brought to the original Woodstock. 
</P>
<P>
 Festival organizers did offer a healthy assortment of international acts on 
the smaller, south stage -- among them the W.O.M.A.D. world music revue and a 
Jimmy Cliff-led reggae jam. The show's preliminary bill on Friday did showcase 
contemporary bands, though the mediocrity of most of them was underscored by 
the elegance and ambition of the British band James. 
</P>
<P>
 But the heart of the show was defined by the performances on the huge north 
stage during the Saturday and Sunday shows, which were broadcast on pay TV -- 
and far too much valuable time was turned over to '60s and '70s acts. 
</P>
<P>
 It's one thing to build a bridge between the two Woodstocks, but this show 
was, in the words of its producers, designed for today's Woodstock generation. 
</P>
<P>
 So why not give this generation its music? 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Cocker, the Crosby, Stills and Nash trio, the Allman Brothers Band and 
Traffic have all made valuable contributions to rock, but they shouldn't have 
taken away hours of valuable time from the weekend. As the most important 
songwriter of the '60s, Bob Dylan, who was in Sunday's cast, was the most 
fitting tie to the past and statement of the importance of rock history. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspicion is that the emphasis on older artists was, in part, an attempt 
to attract older viewers for the telecast and upcoming album and film. That 
thinking could backfire because older fans aren't likely to have much interest 
in Nine Inch Nails (though they should) or such other young hotshots as 
Metallica, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Cypress Hill and the Rollins Band. 
Similarly, the absence of more of today's top contemporary bands is likely to 
leave young fans with too little to prize. 
</P>
<P>
 What we are left with in Woodstock '94 is a $30-million festival, complete 
with magnificent sound and evidence of much care for the comfort and safety of 
the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 But its soul came from the energy and spirit of the audience and its 
nourishment chiefly from the vision of Trent Reznor and a few other 
contemporary groups. In the end, there simply wasn't enough of that 
contemporary vision. When the mud is washed away, Woodstock '94 may be 
remembered most as a lost opportunity.

$3-MILLION COURSE FOCUSES IN PART ON SOLVING PROBLEMS WITHOUT FORCE. THE GAMES 
INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE U.N. AND FOREIGN OBSERVERS.

 More than 6,000 troops, foreign observers and humanitarian aid representatives 
are in the midst of a major peacekeeping exercise being staged here at the U.S. 
military's Joint Training Readiness Center. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright, who observed the 
$3-million exercises at Ft.Polk, in central Louisiana, praised the games as 
"very impressive. What they're doing here is very good training for what they 
are going to have to face." 
</P>
<P>
 Troops from aviation, infantry, armor and artillery usually simulate war games 
to maintain combat readiness. 
</P>
<P>
 But the current training course, which began July 31 and ends Aug. 22, focuses 
on peace enforcement and includes representatives from the United Nations, 
foreign observers and non-governmental aid groups, such as the Red Cross and 
Save the Children. 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of "stressful, realistic" training and 11 days and nights of 
continuous simulated combat, troops learn how to deal with role-playing 
civilians and are taught to seek non-force, non-lethal solutions to difficult 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
 Soldiers are as likely to be treating refugees for cholera or dealing with 
renegade remnants of warring ethnic groups as clearing a buffer zone or wiping 
out a sniper nest in a civilian village. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers explained that the peace enforcement training has evolved from U.S. 
military experience in Rwanda, Somalia, the Gulf War and training Dutch 
peacekeepers for Cambodia at a U.S. training center in Germany.

COMING TO TERMS WITH AUSTERITY; EDUCATION: COLLEGE STUDENTS MAY FIND CROWDED 
CLASSES, FEWER CHOICES AND HIGHER COSTS. BUT AT LEAST THINGS HAVEN'T GOTTEN 
WORSE. 
</P>

 Orange County's more than 200,000 college students are likely to find fewer 
classes and more crowded classrooms as they head to school this fall, according 
to administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes begin Tuesday at Orange Coast College and Golden West College. Five 
more community colleges -- Cypress, Fullerton, Irvine Valley, Rancho Santiago 
and Saddleback -- will start Aug. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrollment at public universities and colleges in Orange County is projected 
to decline slightly compared to last autumn, but the number of students opting 
for small private colleges is growing. At the same time, the number of classes 
at many local public colleges is shrinking, and fees at major state 
institutions continue to grow, mirroring a nationwide trend, education experts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Student fees at UC Irvine, Cal State Fullerton and Cal State Long Beach 
increased 10% in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fees at the community colleges remained level this year, however, after more 
than doubling between 1991 and 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be incredible -- you could take 14 units for $50," said community 
college student Brian Bailey, 26, as he waited in a registration line at Orange 
Coast College. "It's more money now, but it's still a lot less than at a 
university."  
</P>
<P>
 College and university officials said tough economic times have made it 
necessary to raise tuition as much as four times the inflation rate, and some 
institutions are limiting enrollment so they can afford to provide services 
with limited funds from the state. 
</P>
<P>
 But if higher education's economic picture in 1994 is bleak, officials said, 
at least it's no bleaker than last year's.  
</P>
<P>
 Administrators said they are not limiting enrollment at their schools 
drastically, as they did in 1993; and larger financial aid packages are 
becoming available to low- and middle-income students who need help, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not exempt from what's happening in California" economically, said 
Bill Haddad, acting associate vice president for academic programs at Cal State 
Fullerton. "But I wouldn't say the university has suffered more than the 
average Joe on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Enrollment numbers at local public colleges and universities this fall are 
only estimates at this point, and officials are unsure if enrollment will climb 
or take a tumble. But administrators are predicting that enrollment will either 
decline slightly or level off at Cal State Fullerton and Cal State Long Beach 
and will grow modestly at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI spokesman Scott Nelson said the university likely will "see some growth, 
but it's small and certainly nothing like the growth we saw a few years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Community college officials are cautious about early enrollment statistics but 
most indicate the student populations will remain level at most colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Total enrollment for the county's 10 public colleges and Cal State Long Beach 
is expected to be about 200,000 students, administrators say. 
</P>
<P>
 According to preliminary nationwide statistics released by the American Assn. 
of State Colleges and Universities, enrollment at public universities dipped 
1.1% in fall, 1993, compared to 1992 -- the first drop in seven years. Reasons 
given include increased tuition, poor economic conditions and a smaller pool of 
high school graduates. Officials will keep an eye on this year's numbers to see 
if the decrease continues.  
</P>
<P>
 Enrollment at local private colleges and universities is increasing, according 
to projections. Small, young institutions such as Southern California College 
in Costa Mesa and Concordia University in Irvine are growing quickly, campus 
spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our growth and shift from solely liberal arts to a more comprehensive 
institution happened at the same time" as budget problems in state schools, 
said Chapman University spokeswoman Ruth Wardwell. Chapman has tried to 
increase recruiting in Orange County, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Haddad of Cal State Fullerton said advertising may make the difference for 
private schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Historically, we haven't spent much money on advertising," Haddad said. 
"Private colleges do try to get their message out." 
</P>
<P>
 Private colleges can promise classes that students need to graduate in four 
years, Haddad said. Some Cal State students, many of whom work and commute to 
campus, have said it is impossible to get into the classes they need to 
graduate in just four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said it takes an average of 4.9 years to graduate from a Cal State 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Haddad said, "When you go to a private school, you commit to staying on 
campus. If you made the same commitment to Cal State Fullerton, you'd be able 
to graduate in four years." 
</P>
<P>
 At Cal State Fullerton, fees for students taking seven units or more will rise 
from $810 to $900 in the fall. At Cal State Long Beach, full-time students can 
expect to pay about $850. UCI undergraduates from California will pay about 
$1,444 in state and campus fees for the fall quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Community college students will still pay $13 a unit, as they did in 1993. 
Students with four-year degrees pay $50 a unit.  
</P>
<P>
 "Seven units is going to cost me $91, plus $10 health fee, $10 service fee, 
$20 parking fee -- that's $121 I don't have," said Edward Bellamy, 23, of 
Fountain Valley, who recently signed up for classes at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to come back to school because I want to get a real job," said 
Bellamy, who works for a shipping company and is a promoter for a nightclub on 
the side. 
</P>
<P>
 A sampling of private universities shows their tuitions are also on the rise. 
Chapman University will raise its tuition 5% to $16,624 this year, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton's Blackburn said higher fees at his university might have 
"scared off a few people," but the students who remain are taking heavier 
course loads. The number of courses offered has remained about the same. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI, so far, is offering 5,882 total course sections -- 164 fewer than last 
year -- but classes may be added, UCI officials said. Class sizes may increase 
there and at other universities, a complaint heard increasingly in recent years 
from instructors.  
</P>
<P>
 As of fall, 1993, there were 17.6 students per faculty member at UCI, 
university spokeswoman Susan Menning said. New statistics are not yet 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 Private schools, meanwhile, are increasing their course lists. Southern 
California College will offer 85 more courses than it did last fall, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of classes will remain about the same or dip slightly at most local 
community colleges, officials said. Many colleges are trying to fill classes to 
capacity, and general education courses -- those that fulfill breadth 
requirements at universities -- are especially crammed.  
</P>
<P>
 College officials said students who want to take specific courses should shop 
around. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have students at Golden West who are also enrolled at Coastline and Orange 
Coast College," Golden West spokeswoman Wendy Weber said. "If students really 
want a class, they'll be able to find it." Attendance Report Five of Orange 
County's 11 public colleges expect to have a smaller enrollment this year than 
last, while all three private institutions are projecting student gains. Most 
fall, 1994, figures estimate enrollment on "census dates," usually two weeks 
after classes start. Cypress and Fullerton college statistics for both 1993 and 
1994 are for opening day of class instead. 04,29,11,12,13 Public schools Fall

SKATE DAZE; THE RINK RATS ARE ON A ROLL IN NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As he skates around the wooden floor past the disc jockey, the flashing lights 
and the teen-age girls leaning along the rail, David Valdez can't gain enough 
speed to jump into an axel. Too many people tonight. Can't risk getting kicked 
out this early in the evening. He'll have to wait for the fast-forward session 
or sneak in a couple of moves near closing time, when the floor guards have 
their backs turned. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the house lights are up and the music coming from the 16 speakers above 
the rink plays a slower tune, so Valdez decides to take a break. "I hate this 
song," he says before unlacing his roller blades. It's open skating tonight, 
and Northridge Skateland is packed with nearly 300 skaters from all over the 
San Fernando Valley who have come to circle the rink's hardwood floor in 
counterclockwise revolutions to the beat of the latest Top 40 pop tunes. Most 
have come to skate, but some skate to meet members of the opposite sex. The 
skating rink is the place to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Skateland DJ Troy Cooper spins a fast rock and roll song to pump up the crowd 
as he turns down the lights to alter the mood. The floor guards, dressed in 
referee stripes, circulate among the skaters, keeping an eye out for a knee 
drop, axel or one of about a dozen other illegal maneuvers that will earn a 
skater some time on the bench. Three warnings and a skater is out. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Skateland can accommodate 1,201 people, attendance is normally 
thinner, numbering 300 to 400 on a Friday or Saturday night. Session manager 
Marc Todd, 33, say today's crowds pale in comparison to the hordes of previous 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you weren't here when the doors opened at 7, you didn't get in," Todd 
recalls of his skating heyday in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 The faces at the rink have changed over the years, but the enthusiasm for 
skating hasn't. The rink rats -- kids who hang out at the rink every day during 
the summer -- number about 200 and help keep the rink alive. Music, fashions 
and skates have evolved and modernized. Roller blades are in vogue today, and 
speed skates have replaced the clay-wheeled block skates of yesteryear. Baggy 
shorts and big shirts are the hot fashion items, and the DJs track the latest 
alternative music. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission prices are still less than a movie ticket, and skate rental is only 
$1.50 a pair. One only has to lace up and hit the wood.

DESPITE HOT WEATHER, SPIRITS STAY HIGH AT CHRISTIAN MUSIC FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 It could have been described as Woodstock with a big dose of the gospel thrown 
in. There were messages of peace and love, but the emphasis here was on God's 
love. Vendors hawked T-shirts, but instead of the tie-dyed variety, they 
carried pithy sayings about Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 The last day of "Summer Praise '94," a Christian music festival at the Los 
Angeles Equestrian Center in Burbank, was a low-key event. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the 100-plus temperatures, more than 15,000 people -- mostly 
teen-agers and young adults -- came out during the four-day music festival to 
hear Christian rockers, buy T-shirts with Biblical inscriptions or enjoy the 
amusement rides. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came to hear some good Christian bands, and see what kinds of things the 
vendors have," said Jackie Shires, who drove with her husband, Tim, and their 
small child from Temecula. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christian musicians on hand ranged from Sozo, a house music duo, to 
Christ-afaria, a reggae group. Danielle Pryor of Sozo said her music promotes a 
drug- and sex-free lifestyle. "We want to show people that you don't have to 
live that kind of life to have fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Between music acts, there were speeches. One man, who said he was a high 
school principal, urged the assembled to encourage their schools to offer 
courses in Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you begin to present the arguments for Bible study to your school 
boards, they will get very excited," the man said. "We wonder why people can't 
follow laws. It's because young people don't read the Bible in school anymore. 
So we must tell (school officials) our Constitution could not continue to work 
without our Bible." 
</P>
<P>
 Vendor Dennis Trollope was selling T-shirts, one of which showed a Noah's 
Ark-as-spaceship. The passengers in the futuristic vessel were singer Michael 
Jackson and his pet orangutan. "See, they're going to pick up all the animals 
in the zoos and (research) laboratories because there won't be any diseases," 
Trollope explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen-year-old Eric Dant of Long Beach was a volunteer in the prayer tent. 
"People come in and we talk about their trials and tribulations," he said. 
"Then I try to find something in the Scriptures that relates to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the sauna-like conditions of the canvas tent, Eric said he wasn't 
bothered. "God will provide," he said about the heat. "It's not burdensome at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 Other booths at "Summer Praise" included Pog Heaven, which sold Pog pieces 
with passages from the Bible imprinted on them, and a pregnancy crisis 
counseling center offering alternatives to abortion.

MOTORCYCLIST LOSES CONTROL, IS KILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man died after losing control of his motorcycle Sunday on Bouquet Canyon 
Road near Santa Clarita, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The motorcycle left a skid mark more than 30 feet long on a narrow and winding 
segment of Bouquet Canyon Road near Vasquez Canyon Road just after 10 a.m. 
Sunday. The motorcyclist was found under a parked van a short time later, 
California Highway Patrol Officer Frank Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man died at the scene, and his identification is being withheld pending 
notification of relatives, according to a coroner's spokesman.

BODIES OF 2 CREW MEMBERS FOUND AT SITE OF PLANE CRASH

 The bodies of two crew members from a C-130 firefighting airplane that 
exploded in midair were recovered Sunday from a rugged canyon 25 miles south of 
Palmdale, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators at the scene Sunday "hiked out with the bodies," said Capt. Dean 
Gilmore of the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board launched an investigation 
of Saturday's crash, which killed the three crew members on board the 
four-engine tanker. The remains of the third crew member have not yet been 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 The C-130 took off from Hemet Saturday afternoon and was on its way to help 
battle a 75-acre blaze in Kern County when it crashed in a remote area in the 
Angeles National Forest, according to officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Two fires were ignited by the crash, one which burned 15 acres and took 30 
firefighters to extinguish. The other was a small brush fire, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the plane, which was carrying fire retardant, was rocked by 
three midair explosions before it went down. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane and its crew were from the Hemet Valley Flying Service, which was 
contracted by the U.S. Forest Service, authorities said. JEANNETTE REGALADO

VULNERABLE AGUA DULCE BRACES FOR THE BIG ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the San Andreas fault running right through town, Agua Dulce residents 
have a lot to be concerned about in the event of the Big One. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are sitting ducks out here," said Stewart Aleshire, who has started up a 
volunteer disaster-preparedness program at the Agua Dulce Airpark. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Jan. 17 quake wrecked local freeways and cut off Agua Dulce from Los 
Angeles, radios and small planes at the airpark -- nestled in the canyons north 
of the Antelope Valley Freeway -- provided much of the emergency transportation 
and communication. 
</P>
<P>
 To expand disaster response efforts, Aleshire teamed up with two Agua Dulce 
pilots to form the Agua Dulce Airpark Center for Emergency Services. With a 
volunteer corps of radio operators, trained nurses and rescue workers, the 
center can provide a range of emergency services. 
</P>
<P>
 To spread the word on the disaster relief center, the airpark held an open 
house -- or open hangar -- to demonstrate how the radios can be used to call 
Los Angeles County officials for help and send messages to relatives and loved 
ones. Small planes took off to show how they will scout the area for fires, 
crumbled buildings and injured people. 
</P>
<P>
 All 23 hangar owners at the airpark have agreed to operate radios or fly 
aircraft in the event of a major disaster, said Gary Hart-shorn, a pilot and 
disaster center organizer. Hartshorn also wants each resident of Agua Dulce to 
buy a citizens-band radio that can be plugged into a car cigarette lighter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then you know someone will hear you," Hartshorn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing to a ranch-style house next to the runway, Hartshorn said, "I live 
there and if I need to, I can hike it down the hill to my plane." He said he 
flew to work in Glendale while the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways 
were being repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the fault line is only half a mile from the end of the airpark, 
Hartshorn says he believes the paved runway will be usable no matter what 
happens to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if we really get trashed, the planes can land and take off," Hartshorn 
said. The runway is 4,600 feet long, and all the small planes that operate from 
the airpark can land on a strip of only 2,300 feet, he said.
