 Ghost writings: It may be low on your list of urban fears, but author Laurie 
Jacobson says the Southland is full of ghosts. Some stops in her new book, 
"Hollywood Haunted": 
</P>
<P>
 * At the Rexford Drive house of the late actor Clifton Webb, who vowed to 
remain "even in death," one resident "felt herself being hugged by a warm but 
invisible presence in her bed. The toilet paper in the bathroom would often 
unroll by itself. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 * After actor Lon Chaney's death, "his ghost was regularly spotted sitting on 
a bus bench at Hollywood and Vine. . . ." (Hope it doesn't mind the Metro Rail 
construction.) 
</P>
<P>
 * At the Comedy Store, an employee "heard a low buzz of voices, 'Bssimm, 
bssimm, bssimm,' " from a locked empty room. One theory is that the voices were 
those of the victims of the mobsters who used to hang out there when it was 
Ciro's nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 * A worker dusting a mirror in the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel "saw the 
reflection of a blonde. She turned to speak to the woman, but there was no one 
standing behind her. Yet when she turned back to the mirror, the reflection was 
still there. This mirror hung in Suite 1200, often used by Marilyn Monroe. Two 
psychics have 'read' the mirror and felt great sadness." 
</P>
<P>
 * An overnight guest in Room 928 of the Hollywood Roosevelt "felt a hand 
patting her shoulder while she lay in bed reading. She turned to say good night 
to her husband, but he was sound asleep." 
</P>
<P>
 We're sure that when she related the episode to her husband in the morning, he 
responded, "Bssimm, bssimm, bssimm." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He's lucky it wasn't his highway to heaven: We mean the wrong-way commuter who 
was spotted Monday on the San Diego Freeway. On a bicycle. miscelLAny Congrats

AL MARTINEZ: A STREET NAMED MERIDETH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was an extraordinary weekend. In Pasadena, while millions watched, the 
television industry honored itself with Emmys. And in Malibu, 43 gathered to 
name a driveway after Burgess Merideth. I mean Meredith. 
</P>
<P>
 The events were in no way related, except by our tendency to elevate those in 
show biz to the status of sainthood. And while a driveway to a shopping center 
doesn't compare to an airport or a hospital wing, it's better than what most of 
us get. 
</P>
<P>
 Come to think of it, I guess there were certain similarities in the Pasadena 
and Malibu ceremonies. The same gestures and superlatives abounded in both 
places. 
</P>
<P>
 There were enough hugs and kisses at the two events to seduce a nun, and 
whatever adjectives of adoration remained unused after the ceremonies weren't 
worth using in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 We heard 86-year-old Meredith described as loving, kind, warm, gifted, 
generous, charming, witty, gracious and even intelligent, although intelligent 
wasn't granted the same emphasis as, say, charming. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Lemmon and Carroll O'Connor sent messages of regret for not being in 
attendance. Fortunately, however, the ex-wife of a former friend of a dead 
actor named Franchot Tone, who had been a pal of Meredith, did attend, and she 
remarked on Meredith's fine sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 He needed it on this particular day because after he was showered with enough 
sweetness to cause hyperglycemia, they presented him with a plaque that spelled 
his name wrong. It said Merideth instead of Meredith. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was an honest mistake and did not detract from the almost messianic nature 
of the moment. Gene Wood, a former television game show host who arranged for 
the driveway-naming, swore he had double-checked the spelling, but those things 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
 I had a byline in the Oakland Tribune once that identified me as "Al 
Fartinez," and it has followed me for an entire career. By comparison, Merideth 
isn't so bad after all. 
</P>
<P>
 His name was spelled correctly, by the way, on the street sign that identified 
the driveway as Burgess Meredith Way, to the enthusiastic applause of the 43 
people in attendance. The plaque, which will be remade, is intended to be set 
in concrete in front of the Malibu Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 I was there because the whole thing was so, well, Malibuish. The mayor, Jeff 
Kramer, who is pretty enough to be a movie star, attended in shorts and 
sneakers, which is de rigueur in Malibu. I haven't seen so many white sneakers 
in one place since the 1984 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Meredith was honored not only because he's a terrific actor, but because he 
was a leader in the fight for Malibu's cityhood. And because, I guess, he's 
old. We like to honor the elderly before they slip out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not making fun of that. It's a good idea. A free-lancer I knew once wrote 
what almost amounted to an obituary for a crusty old female journalist whom 
everyone thought was dying. As it turned out, she didn't die, but he did, which 
is the way things sometimes happen. The laugh was on him. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone, I'm sorry to say, knew who Meredith is. A grungy-looking guy in 
his 20s who could have been either a bum or a surfer wanted to know what was 
going on. I said it was a ceremony honoring Burgess Meredith. 
</P>
<P>
 He said, so help me, "What's a burger merafish?" I said it was a Malibu 
cheeseburger in which they replaced beef with a healthful ground salmon. He 
said, "Far out," and left. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before you get all indignant over what appears to be my mocking attitude 
toward a loving ceremony, let me say that Burgess Meredith is one of my 
favorite actors, Malibu is one of my favorite towns, and Guido's is one of my 
favorite restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 I mention Guido's because it is in the same shopping center and because a 
strange event occurred there the other night when my wife, Cinelli, and I were 
having dinner. A man and woman in the next booth were engaged in passionate 
embraces and he was licking the side of her face. 
</P>
<P>
 I've seen a lot of passion over the years, but I can't recall ever having seen 
anyone lick his partner's face in public. Perhaps that's a gesture of affection 
practiced only in Malibu, the way they rub noses in certain northern cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 None of that went on at the event honoring Merideth, I mean Meredith, but it 
could have. I've never seen such an outpouring of affection. As Faye Dunaway 
might have put it, "This town has heart." 
</P>
<P>
 A harpist played "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" at the end of the ceremony, 
which gave it all a kind of ethereal quality. I was so impressed, I stayed 
longer than I should have and was late for a dinner date. 
</P>
<P>
 It irritated Cinelli a little, but I licked her face later and she forgave me.

FUNDS FOR RESEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I would like to suggest to David Goodstein that there is a way to forestall 
the coming Dark Age of research (Commentary, Aug. 31). Public support of 
science and technology has always been greatest when there are dragons to slay, 
as was the case with the Manhattan and Apollo projects. The superconducting 
super collider was canceled because its goal, to find the Higgs particle, was 
not seen to be of practical benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of concentrating on abstract research, the scientific and 
technological community might focus on a goal of immense practical significance 
that the taxpayers could wholeheartedly support. For almost half a century, 
physicists have been attempting to develop controlled thermonuclear fusion as a 
step toward its eventual exploitation as an economically competitive energy 
source. This is a problem of tremendous theoretical difficulty (and so can 
attract scientists), extreme technological complexity (and so can attract 
engineers), and awesome practical ramifications (and so can attract funding). 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the potential value of the development of controlled and 
economically competitive thermonuclear fusion, it would seem that there would 
be substantial support from the scientific and funding communities for such a 
project.

 * Currently, we spend more on health care in 10 days than we spend on research 
in an entire year. The mathematics of that equation show that only three cents 
of every health care dollar go to research. Does this make sense? In a recent 
Harris Poll commissioned by the not-for-profit advocacy group Research!America, 
nine out of every 10 Americans said this nation should spend more on medical 
research to better diagnose, prevent and treat disease, and two out of every 
three persons surveyed said medical research is the single most valuable type 
of scientific research. 
</P>
<P>
 Popular support from the general citizenry for medical research has been 
placed on the back shelf in the debate over health care reform. Medical 
research, not only because of its value to the economy but also for its value 
to human life, must be made a higher national priority. RICHARD N. LOLLEY

RICH HARVESTS OF IMAGES; POET AMY CLAMPITT AND ACTRESS JESSICA TANDY OFFERED 
THE WORLD VERY SPECIAL GIFTS 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 In "Nothing Stays Put," Amy Clampitt describes, obviously, the exotic flowers 
and plants that spill out from Manhattan's greengroceries. But she could well 
have been describing her own work, a rich and luminous harvest of images, as 
well as the elegant, enduring performances of actress Jessica Tandy. Clampitt 
died Saturday at 74; her death preceded by a day that of Tandy, at 85. The two 
women had far more in common than induction into a grim sisterhood of death by 
ovarian cancer. In an era when literary and theatrical stars often have an 
"attitude," these women were without pretense. They were gifted, hard-working 
professionals in worlds often dominated by transitory phenoms; genteel, 
white-haired women among the brassy and sometimes banal. 
</P>
<P>
 For their obvious talents, both were richly rewarded, fortunately in their 
lifetimes. Tandy won four Tony Awards and an Academy Award, among other honors, 
during a 67-year career that included more than 100 plays, 25 movies and 
numerous television shows. Clampitt, who published the first of five major 
poetry collections at 63, was awarded a MacArthur Foundation "genius grant" in 
1992 and membership in the American Academy and the Institute of Arts and 
Letters.  
</P>
<P>
 Both could dignify the commonplace emotion or image, making it timeless. Miss 
Daisy lingers with us because of Tandy's spare but honest portrayal of the 
aging and fiercely independent Southern woman in the movie "Driving Miss 
Daisy." So much of Clampitt's poetry resonates because she too could connect 
across generations. To her, the sidewalk "largesse" from the tropics harked 
back to her prairie childhood, her grandmother's garden, "a cross-stitch / of 
living matter, sown and tended by women, / nurturers everywhere of the strange 
and wonderful / beneath whose hands what had been alien begins / as it alters, 
to grow as through it were indigenous."  
</P>
<P>
 For Clampitt and Tandy, perhaps there is no more fitting image.

DIRECTING A FLOOD OF ANTI-CRIME FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton is due to sign the crime bill today before an audience that 
includes big-city mayors and families of crime victims. His signature will 
trigger the distribution of $2.3 billion already approved by Congress to pay 
for more local police, state prisons and border control, among other law 
enforcement improvements. That's good news -- if the money flows as quickly as 
promised and is wisely spent. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington rarely moves this fast on appropriations. But before recessing, 
Congress approved much of the crime bill's funding in the appropriations bill 
for the Commerce, Justice and State departments. How fast the coveted federal 
funds will be spent will depend on cooperation between the Justice Department 
and local governments. U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, to her credit, is already 
trying to speed up that process. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest crime bill appropriation allots $1.3 billion for community 
policing. The feds will pay 75% of the cost of hiring more police officers 
while local communities put up 25%. That's a bargain, but only until the 
federal funds run out in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 To take advantage of the new money, some municipalities may be tempted to 
compromise screening and rush recruits through training. That would be a 
mistake, as the current problems of Washington's police force prove. Shortcuts 
taken when that force expanded rapidly resulted in some poorly trained officers 
who were unable to testify properly in court; others have been charged with 
selling drugs or other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Another large appropriation provides $230 million to cover state costs for 
imprisoning illegal immigrants convicted of felonies. The crime bill also 
includes $284 million to hire nearly 1,000 Border Patrol agents and to 
accelerate deportation of immigrants who are in the United States illegally. 
Both are appropriate priorities for federal funding. Control of national 
borders is a federal responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the appropriations for fiscal 1995 are $450 million to help law 
enforcement agencies fund investigative task forces and drug abuse education; 
$100 million to allow the FBI to computerize the national background checks 
required by the Brady gun control law and to upgrade state criminal records; 
$29 million to establish state drug courts; $26 million to toughen state 
prosecutions of domestic violence and sexual assault cases, and $256 million to 
fund state boot camps for young offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, only a scant $1.5 million has been allocated for prevention programs. 
Much more is promised, and needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseeing this mammoth crime bill will be a huge challenge. Thanks to Reno's 
fast action, the first dollars should flow in October. Not soon enough for a 
crime-weary public.

HAITI INVASION THREATENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "U.S. Uses Toughest Language Yet on Haiti," Sept. 1: 
</P>
<P>
 At an Aug. 31 press conference, Deputy Defense Secretary John Deutch and 
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott all but promised a U.S.-led invasion 
of Haiti. I am sure they know that the U.S. invaded Haiti in 1915 and then 
occupied that nation from 1915 to 1934. And, that the most visible product of 
that military occupation was the formation and training by U.S. Marines of the 
Garde d'Haiti , which evolved into the Haitian armed forces, whose current 
military rulers were threatened by Talbott with certain arrest by the U.S. and 
being turned over to a U.S.-military-installed Aristide government. 
</P>
<P>
 I am sure they know that, after the last U.S. military occupation, the Haitian 
political structure deteriorated and all elections were crooked. Haiti had 
either puppet officials ruled by the military or dictators who put the military 
under their absolute control. And, during most of those years, the U.S. 
provided economic aid to those governments. Finally, in 1986, the U.S. 
President backed a military junta which drove out dictator Jean-Claude (Baby 
Doc) Duvalier and replaced him with Gen. Henri Namphy, who, in 1988, was ousted 
and replaced by Gen. Prosper Avril. Jean-Bertrand Aristide was elected and 
served as president for only seven months in 1991 before the military ousted 
him. So much for a U.S. military invasion and occupation of Haiti!

<P>
 Apparently, former President Bush learned from our history. He told a banking 
conference in Buenos Aires: "We should not use force against Haiti. "I don't 
want to see United States soldiers occupying foreign territory." I hope that 
news media editors and commentators will make sure that everyone knows that 
there never has been democracy in Haiti, despite 80 years of U.S. military and 
economic intervention.

 It would be a great mistake for President Clinton to send U.S. troops to 
invade Haiti. Many people in Haiti and elsewhere would regard that, rightly or 
wrongly, as a return to imperialism and look upon the Americans as foreign 
invaders and greet their arrival with hatred. 
</P>
<P>
 If Clinton is convinced that force is necessary to oust Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras 
and his gang, there is better way. 
</P>
<P>
 Haitians should be equipped and trained to do the job, not Americans. There 
are enough Haitians at Guantanamo and in Florida to make up a sufficient 
contingent to get the job done. President Aristide could lead his own troops 
made up of his own countrymen and followers to liberate his own land from the 
forces of evil. He would gain legitimacy and stature by doing so rather than 
riding in on the coattails of the U.S. Marines. Why, Aristide could even be 
regarded as another Toussaint L'Ouverture! 
</P>
<P>
 Far better that Haitians should be directly responsible for bringing freedom 
and democracy to their own homeland than that they should have to rely upon 
Americans to do the job for them.

 Beware of foreign policy ideas wrapped in righteous explanations by tired 
technocrats reworking failed policies from the past. Cuba's migrants now 
arriving in Panama (Sept. 7) are being held at Empire Range, where those 
opposed to the 1989 United States invasion of Panama were also kept -- such as 
Panama's recently elected president, Ernesto Perez Balladares. 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't anyone in Washington working on Haitian policy remember that the 
embargo of Panama did not force Gen. Manuel Noriega out, that the invasion cost 
a huge amount in lives and economic treasure, that drug trafficking has not 
ended, and that the political party of the new government in Panama supported 
the policies of both Gen. Omar Torrijos and Gen. Noriega? 
</P>
<P>
 Are we destined to suffer a similar irony in the future in Haiti just because 
President Clinton feels he has to prove how tough he is on those who defy his 
view of the world and because our "experts" are still trying to prove that 
economic embargoes, inevitably having to be followed by U.S. military force, 
provide the lasting security we crave?

RUSSIA'S WWII ROLE

 In response to "Russian Troops Bid Farewell to Germany, Baltics" (Sept. 1): 
</P>
<P>
 leussians lost 20 million human beings during World War II. Hundreds of 
Russian cities and 70,000 villages were burned to the ground.Few countries paid 
so much for the victory over Hitler. But every time Americans start talking 
about the war, they cannot find a single word on Russia's sacrifices. Just 
Stalin's crimes and the damned Berlin Wall. And they are not pleased that Boris 
Yeltsin "chose to concentrate on the Russian role in defeating Adolf Hitler's 
Germany." 
</P>
<P>
 It is incontestable that no sacrifices may justify an occupation of other 
states. The issue is that I am bitterly surprised reading my daughter's school 
textbook. Here, the Soviet army role in World War II looks like a reserved 
regiment for the triumphant liberators from the West. I care that my daughter 
study the truth. I came to this country because I was sick of the lies in the 
Soviet Union. I understand Americans' desire that their children grow up as 
patriots. But that has nothing to do with concealment of the truth.

DISNEY HALL

<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Great Cities, Great Public Works," Commentary, Aug. 30: 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Weinstein's column regarding the role of great architecture in 
defining great cities eloquently expressed the need for public support for 
monumental structures such as the proposed Disney Hall. Responsible citizens 
should gather behind this effort. 
</P>
<P>
 One caveat, however. Not only was the cited example, Jorn Utzon's Sydney Opera 
House, over cost, its final price tag was almost 15 times the 1959 original 
projection of $5.6 million dollars (U.S.)! Nonetheless, because of an effective 
state lottery for the opera house, it was completely paid for within two years 
of completion in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the lessons Los Angeles can learn from the Sydney experience are: 1) 
to go into this with its eyes open regarding realistic costs based on problems 
of construction, material costs, potential labor problems, etc., and 2) plan 
for a mechanism of financing the enterprise which will capture the imagination 
of the citizens of Southern California.

COLUMN RIGHT/ JONATHAN CLARKE: DIPLOMACY IS ILL-SERVED BY NAME-CALLING; 
PAINTING ADVERSARIES AS BUFFOONS TRIPS UP THE U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN CLARKE, Jonathan Clarke, a member of the British diplomatic service 
for 20 years, is now at the Cato Institute in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To judge from the language of American diplomacy in 1994, foreigners are a 
feckless lot. They are "irrational" (Kim Il Sung), "desperate" (Fidel Castro), 
"rogues" (Moammar Kadafi), enfeebled by old age (Deng Xiaoping) or garden 
variety "thugs" (Raoul Cedras, Slobodan Milosevic). In short, not worthy of 
statesmanlike treatment by the United States.  
</P>
<P>
 This allegedly ill-endowed crew has, however, enjoyed a pretty good year -- 
much of it at U.S. expense. The Chinese humiliated the secretary of state in 
March. Their reward? Renewal of most-favored nation status and a visit in 
August by the secretary of commerce with a slew of top businessmen in tow. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his death, Kim's shadow-boxing on the question of North Korea's nuclear 
potential earned his (equally "irrational") successor the prospect of 
diplomatic recognition and the promise of a new, fully paid-for nuclear 
reactor. And the little matter of accounting for past plutonium production is 
now on the back burner.  
</P>
<P>
 Castro has succeeded in reinstating the American trade embargo on the U.S. 
political agenda and in rewriting U.S. immigration laws, not to mention 
consuming huge amounts of taxpayer money. 
</P>
<P>
 In Libya, Kadafi has just celebrated the 25th anniversary of his regime, 
which, in comparison to his neighbors Egypt and Algeria, looks like an oasis of 
stability. 
</P>
<P>
 Milosevic has made himself indispensable as the main pressure point on the 
Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Cedras' prospects look cloudy, but even he can expect a comfortable 
retirement in the south of France. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad going for a bunch of supposedly isolated, impoverished or flaky 
has-beens. Boris Yeltsin, who once held top position in U.S. foreign-policy 
priorities, would have been grateful for a tenth of the presidential time and 
attention devoted to Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has not been alone in falling into this trap. Senators, 
representatives, columnists and commentators have all delivered themselves of 
dismissive adjectives about foreign leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble is, diplomacy by personalized abuse just does not work. Calling 
people names may relieve tension or frustration, but will lead policy-makers 
into grave error if they start believing their own rhetoric. International 
diplomacy is conducted between sovereign states, complex entities that cannot 
be given simplistic labels. 
</P>
<P>
 A cardinal rule of athletics is never to underestimate your opponents; that 
puts a dangerous weapon into their hands. So it is with foreign relations. 
Opponents may be (and often are) highly unsavory. This does not mean, however, 
that the problems they create can be treated with less than top-class 
diplomatic finesse. 
</P>
<P>
 Demeaning characterization undermines this principle. It creates the 
impression that a problem is a one-dimensional battle between good and evil, 
with the good destined to win effortlessly. Surely, the experience of 1994 has 
demonstrated the error of this approach. The belief, for example, that Kim Il 
Sung was an irrational, isolated dictator led U.S. policy-makers to ignore his 
viewpoint, which was that he was acting highly rationally in trying to protect 
North Korea's independence and squeeze out what benefit he could from the West. 
He noted that Ukraine exploited its nuclear status to gain economic assistance. 
He copied this example and succeeded in doing well for his country. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, when the first wave of Cuban refugees started to wash ashore in 
Florida, the U.S. reaction was to dismiss Castro as a desperate holdover from 
communism seeking to solve his domestic problems at American expense. Maybe so, 
but, more important, he caught the Administration with its pants down. While 
the world moved on, U.S. policy on Cuba had remained frozen in an incredibly 
untenable Cold War time warp. Now Castro may walk away with the big prize in 
the shape of the ending of the embargo. Senior Democrats, including the 
chairmen of both the Senate and House foreign affairs committees, have taken 
his side. Meanwhile, he has exposed the Clinton Administration as in thrall to 
the Republican-voting Cuban community in Miami. All in all, an astute political 
play.  
</P>
<P>
 These missteps should convey the message that U.S. diplomacy must discard 
ill-conceived abuse as a diplomatic weapon. It doesn't get the job done. Many 
foreign leaders may be distasteful; their countries may be less well governed 
and less prosperous than the United States, but this does not mean that they 
are dopes. If foreigners can play their cards skillfully, Americans had better 
do so as well. In the critical tests confronting the United States, such as a 
possible invasion of Haiti and the lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia, 
a clear head will provide a surer guide than a dictionary of insults.

<P>
 In Cuba, as in Haiti, the real answer to these tragedies lies with the people 
themselves, not in some notion of U.S. troops acting either as a landing force 
or welfare support group. Guantanamo Bay is actually a training base, or at 
least it was.So let's get it back on line; let's make an announcement to all 
those strong, dedicated Cubans who braved sharks and 10-foot waves that they 
can volunteer to be trained at Guantanamo to form a force that one day will 
free their people from Fidel Castro's grip. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of almost universal disdain, Castro has been able to remain in power 
because he is protected by personal security troops, numbering 10,000 by some 
estimates. Remember, there are more than 20,000 Cubans at Guantanamo already, 
plus another million or so living in Florida who just might welcome a chance to 
participate in bringing down Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 As the training began to turn out an elite fighting corps, word could be 
beamed to the people of Cuba that help is finally on the way, help from their 
own husbands and sons -- who better to liberate their country?

ANOTHER 11TH-HOUR JOB FOR JIMMY CARTER; HAITI: THE BIG RISK OF INVASION IS THE 
LONG-TERM BURDEN CLINTON WOULD IMPOSE ON THE U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH H. BLATCHFORD, Joseph H. Blatchford, director of the Peace Corps from 
1969 to 1973, is a lawyer in Washington dealing largely with matters related to 
the Western Hemisphere. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As so often happens in Washington, the unthinkable -- the prospect of the 
United States invading Haiti -- has rapidly traveled the distance from 
preposterous to expected. The long-range implications of such a strategy for 
dealing with Haiti's military rulers are being brushed aside. The priority is 
to demonstrate that President Clinton is a decisive leader: When he says that 
the thugs who staged the coup must go and Jean-Bertrand Aristide must return, 
the Pentagon must make it so. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it no longer worth consideration that Americans will lose their lives for a 
cause that has nothing to do with our nation's security? 
</P>
<P>
 Is it not even worth mentioning the likelihood of our responsibility extending 
far beyond the reinstatement of President Aristide? Should that effort succeed, 
President Clinton and his Administration will be held responsible for every 
action the volatile Aristide takes, particularly those that are deemed to be 
undemocratic. 
</P>
<P>
 Only when all the unpleasant consequences are upon us will the critics be out 
in force charging that the President acted hastily, ignoring other options, 
which by then will be obvious to anyone gifted with hindsight. 
</P>
<P>
 No one really believes that the United States can land troops in Haiti, hand 
the keys over to Aristide and leave. So the responsible approach would be to 
acknowledge at the outset that the U.S. government is assuming a trusteeship to 
oversee Haiti for years to come. If that sounds like another unthinkable 
option, rest assured that it will gain legitimacy once U.S. troops arrive for 
what will be the second attempt this century to establish democracy in Haiti. 
Call it "Operation Get It Right This Time." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the President's advisers don't realize what a quagmire they are 
getting him into when they urge him to invade. For the sake of his own 
political well-being, he should cast beyond his present circle for more 
experienced emissaries to pursue new alternatives. Surely no one is better 
qualified to seek peace and avoid bloodshed in Haiti than Jimmy Carter, 
accompanied by someone of the stature of Gen. Colin Powell of Desert Storm 
fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Say what you will about the Carter presidency, his Camp David accords brought 
peace between Israel and Egypt. His Panama Canal treaty was a major leap 
forward in U.S.-Latin American relations, and as ex-President, his initiative 
to force the Sandinistas to call elections brought democracy back to Nicaragua. 
The returns aren't yet in on his mission to North Korea, but so far it has 
proved useful to all sides. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of a Carter mission would not be limited to simply threatening 
Haiti's military with the use of force. Rather, Carter would consult with 
Haiti's elected parliamentary leaders who undoubtedly have their own ideas for 
avoiding bloodshed. Fruitful talks could possibly lead to a transition 
government of respected citizens who could set the terms for the retirement of 
the coup leaders, supervise the lifting of the embargo and, after a period of 
stability, bring back Aristide to finish his term. Then, new elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrival of such prominent emissaries, perhaps including other leaders in 
the hemisphere, should impress the Haitian military with President Clinton's 
willingness to make one last attempt to find a peaceful way out before an 
invasion is launched. 
</P>
<P>
 President Carter, your peacekeeping days are not over. Please, go to Haiti.

PERSPECTIVE ON NORTHERN IRELAND; DON'T RUSH IN AND TIP THE SCALES; THE IRA 
CEASE-FIRE OFFERS DIPLOMATIC OPENINGS, BUT THE UNITED STATES MUST BEWARE OF 
FUELING THE FEARS OF LOYALISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIMBERLY COWELL, Kimberly Cowell, a doctoral candidate at American 
University, teaches political science there and has been an assistant to the 
spokesman on Irish affairs for the Labor Party in the British Parliament. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A unilateral cease-fire is a curious thing. Why are the Republicans in 
Northern Ireland willing to lay down their weapons after such a long fight? The 
cease-fire announced by the Irish Republican Army on Aug. 30 reflects a shift 
in the balance of power. Although some believe that the Republicans are 
capitulating in the face of insurmountable odds, it appears, instead, that the 
winds of diplomacy are gradually shifting in their favor. 
</P>
<P>
 One look at the Protestant response to the declaration indicates that those 
who lived perhaps most directly in fear of the IRA violence are not celebrating 
the lifting of that weight. On the contrary, Loyalists, both militant and 
mainstream, fear this turn of events because it signifies a closer relationship 
between the British and the Republicans. They believe something significant 
must have happened behind their backs in order for the Republicans to concede 
to meeting the British government's criteria for negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
 As the British open up formal lines of communication with the Republicans, the 
Loyalists increasingly fear that the British will sell them out, either by 
leaving them stranded on the island to fend for themselves or by forcing them 
into a union with Ireland where they will lose their freedoms, status and 
identity. However accurate or inaccurate an estimation of British intentions 
those impressions are (and there is some evidence that British commitment, both 
popular and governmental, to maintaining a presence in Northern Ireland is 
weakening), they are the reigning perceptions of Loyalists and their leaders 
such as Ian Paisley and James Molyneaux. 
</P>
<P>
 These perceptions are important to keep in mind as Americans and the Clinton 
Administration respond to this new turn of events. Although the declaration of 
a cease-fire opens up many U.S. diplomatic opportunities, we must be extremely 
careful about interfering in a very delicate balance of power that holds many 
lives at stake.  
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has been quick to claim credit for the declaration, 
citing the visas granted in the last few months to Joseph Cahill, Patrick 
Treanor and Gerry Adams as evidence of the U.S. involvement in the shifting 
balance in Northern Irish politics. Loyalists do not see the U.S. role in the 
same light. They are already suspicious of the United States for its refusal to 
extradite suspected Republican terrorists to Britain and for American support 
for Noraid (the U.S. fund-raising group that aids families of prisoners caught 
up in Northern Ireland strife, also suspected of funding the IRA). And they are 
already compromised by the improving relationship between Britain and Sinn 
Fein, the IRA's political wing. Thus Loyalists feel that the United States is 
acting to destroy them, directly or indirectly. Pushing them too far may result 
in a Unionist backlash that would cripple the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 Because all sides must be party to a lasting peace, the United States should 
be wary of ruining the progress made in getting the Republicans to sit down at 
the table by scaring off the Unionists. As hard as it is to accept, American 
solutions to the conflict are not Irish solutions, and imposing our will upon 
other sovereign peoples is neither good diplomacy for us nor true 
reconciliation for the Irish. After all, as 600 years of conflict on the island 
of Ireland should have taught us, what Ireland needs is less foreign 
interference, not more.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE F. FREED, Bruce F. Freed is president of Integrated Strategies, a 
Washington consulting firm in strategic government and public affairs, and a 
former senior aide to Democratic House members.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's Jan. 3, 1995, and the 104th Congress has convened for its opening 
session. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Newt Gingrich, the former Republican whip, has just been sworn in as the 
new Speaker, and challenges President Clinton and what he calls the Democratic 
Party/welfare-state nexus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican House approves term limits for committee chairmen and cuts the 
number of committees to 18 from 22. 
</P>
<P>
 John Dingell, former Energy and Commerce Committee chairman and now ranking 
minority member, fires three-quarters of the Democratic staff, cutting back 
from 111 in the last Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative Republican Gary Franks of Connecticut replaces Democrat Kweisi 
Mfume as the most influential black in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a foretaste of what might happen if Republicans go beyond the magic 
218 number and take control of the House. 
</P>
<P>
 That's still an "if." But the possibility that the Democrats' seemingly 
permanent majority might end this November makes it important to look closely 
at just how Republican control of Congress could change Washington and national 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 A revolutionary from the day he entered the House 15 years ago, Gingrich has 
been the chief strategist of the Republican war on the Democrats. His attacks 
led to the downfall of Speaker Jim Wright. C-Span junkies know him through his 
House speeches pushing his populist conservative agenda of low taxes and 
individual responsibility. Today, the Democratic House struggles under the 
image of being a bloated, perk-infested, out-of-touch institution, in large 
part because of the unrelenting Gingrich-led assault. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Republicans become the majority this November, this is what might 
follow: 
</P>
<P>
 * The destruction of the existing congressional order. The GOP's objective 
would be to smash the Democrats' congressional base and rewrite the rules of 
the political and legislative game. This would be done by shrinking Congress' 
budget and staff, passing term limits for members and committee chairmen and 
ending absentee voting in committees and closed rules in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 Power would be diffused at the committee level, where junior members -- mostly 
Republicans -- would have a greater say. And, acting together in their caucus 
and led by a disciplined leadership, the GOP would set party positions and ram 
its legislative program through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 * A tightly focused legislative blitzkrieg. Gingrich would sharpen party 
differences even more. The Republicans would move quickly to pass congressional 
reform and push their anti-tax, socially conservative legislative program. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dismantling the Democratic Party infrastructure. The House Republicans would 
move to financially starve the Democratic Party. They would seek to severely 
restrict contributions from the public relations, law and lobbying firms, 
liberal interest groups and unions that are the Democrats' financial backbone. 
</P>
<P>
 * Winners, losers and new styles. Gingrich and the House Republicans would 
refuse to deal with Democratic lobbying firms. Those firms wouldn't be able to 
hire former Gingrich staffers to get access. He and his allies would reward 
lobbyists who have been long-time supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The diffusion of power in the House would make grass-roots lobbying the "in" 
form; the real action would take place back home -- in Irvine, Dubuque and Fort 
Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Federation of Independent Business and the newly radicalized U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce, long-time Gingrich friends, and companies like Caterpillar 
would be the big winners. So would their anti-tax, anti-union agendas. 
</P>
<P>
 The big losers would be unions, feminist groups, the liberal public-policy 
community, unionized industries like automobiles and transportation -- and 
their activist government agendas. 
</P>
<P>
 * Unremitting partisan warfare. Gridlock would return to Washington. Little 
legislation would move as the Gingrich-led Republicans began their war to 
delegitimize President Clinton and the Democrats, solidify the GOP hold on 
Congress and win the White House. Their weapons would be hot-button issues, 
embarrassing votes and hearings on Administration stumbles and scandals. By 
Speaker Gingrich's calculation, voters would blame President Clinton, not the 
Republicans, for the deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Republicans do win, Gingrich will have secured the beachhead he's 
fought for since he entered the House. The question is whether he will have the 
nerve to boldly break out to achieve his ultimate goal -- the dismantling of 
the New Deal and the ideological remaking of American politics.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; RATING RAITT: STILL ON THE RISE; KNOWN FOR SPIRITED 
INTERPRETATIONS OF OTHERS' WORKS, THE VETERAN ARTIST IS NOW EVOLVING AS AN 
INTIMATE SONGWRITER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC

<TEXT>
<P>
 So how is Bonnie Raitt doing five years after her career-escalating Grammy 
sweep? 
</P>
<P>
 Nicely indeed, thank you -- as demonstrated in a spirited performance Sunday 
at the Hollywood Bowl that was all the more disarming because of some surprise 
father-daughter ties. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no small achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudden mass success can be as disorienting for a veteran pop artist -- in 
Raitt's case, coming after almost two decades of struggle -- as for someone new 
to the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The danger is that the groundswell of popularity can make even the most 
adventurous artist start clinging to the secure and safe in a misguided attempt 
to hold on to the gains. Rather than move forward creatively, the temptation is 
to stand still or look back. 
</P>
<P>
 Not Raitt. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the 3-million-plus sales of 1989's Grammy-winning "Nick of Time" album, 
Raitt was widely admired by critics and a cult audience for her ability to find 
quality songs from a variety of blues, folk and rock sources and interpret them 
with authority. She was also prized for her generosity in drawing attention to 
other artists, whether overlooked blues veterans or up-and-coming 
singer-songwriters. 
</P>
<P>
 She can still do all that -- as she demonstrated Sunday in the way she handled 
with equal command songs as diverse as the Fabulous Thunderbirds' rave-up "I 
Believe I'm in Love" and the Richard Thompson ballad "Dimming of the Day." She 
also continues to lavish praise on writers, and by introducing her six band 
members early in the 90-minute show she established a quick sense of community 
on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The breakthrough is in Raitt's writing. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the intensity and heart that she brings to the outside material as 
both singer and guitarist, Raitt injects an extra layer of revelation in her 
own tunes -- especially a trio of songs from this year's "Longing in Their 
Hearts" album. On all three, interestingly, she switched from her trademark 
bottleneck guitar to keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Cool, Clear Water," pop's most famous redhead sang with intimacy and 
detail about the first blush of true love, and she brought a raw urgency to the 
tempestuous desire of "Feeling of Falling." 
</P>
<P>
 Most touching, however, was "Circle Dance," a tender reflection of a child 
longing for an absent parent -- in Raitt's case, her father, Broadway star John 
Raitt, who was frequently away on tour when she was growing up. Sample lines: 
I'll be home soon, That's what you'd say / And a little kid believes / After a 
while I learned that love / Must be a thing that leaves.  
</P>
<P>
 To the delight of the 15,033 fans, the circle was indeed complete at the end 
of the show when Raitt was joined by her dad for duets of the show tunes "Hey 
There" and "Oklahoma!" -- and it was hard to tell which proud face was beaming 
more. Rarely has success seemed so sweet.

 Taylor Loses First Round: A Los Angeles judge on Monday tentatively threw out 
Elizabeth Taylor's invasion of privacy lawsuit against NBC, paving the way for 
the network to air a TV miniseries based on her life. Superior Court Judge 
Diane Wayne said the actress, who also alleged trademark infringement in her 
complaint against the network and unauthorized biographer C. David Heymann, 
cannot legally block the TV broadcast or publication of a book about her. "The 
intended miniseries involves a biography which, even if defamatory, is 
permitted to be aired under (the law)," Wayne stated in a written ruling. "Any 
harm suffered by (Taylor) is actionable and she may recover damages. (But) she 
is not entitled to a prior injunctive restraint." Wayne has given Taylor's 
lawyer, Neil Papiano, a chance to argue the case on Sept. 28, but she told 
Papiano on Monday that she doubted he would be able to change her mind.

 * Emmy Viewing Increases: ABC estimated Monday that 54 million people watched 
at least part of the Emmy Awards telecast Sunday night. Overnight ratings from 
32 major markets were 15% higher than for last year's Emmy broadcast and showed 
the three-hour program winning each half hour of competition. It averaged a 26% 
share of the audience, compared to 49% for the Academy Awards last March. 
National ratings for the Emmys will be available today. MOVIES

according to Forbes magazine. "It's not so precious to me, and I'm not so 
personal about 'Jurassic Park' that I have any reason not to give the audience 
what they want," Spielberg said. The original "Jurassic Park" grossed $900 
million at the box office.

THEATER REVIEW; 'SWEENEY TODD': A CUT ABOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Sweeney Todd," Stephen Sondheim's dark and dangerous 1979 musical now at 
Moonlight Amphitheatre in Vista, presents a complex challenge to any company. 
</P>
<P>
 This musical, based on Christopher Bond's 1973 play, which was in turn 
inspired by an incident more than a century old, tells the tale of an English 
barber who murders customers whom his landlady then grinds up and bakes into 
her increasingly popular meat pies. 
</P>
<P>
 While it won eight out of the nine Tony Awards it was nominated for, including 
best musical, best score, best book and best direction, it puzzled many, 
dazzled some and outraged others. It earned back only 59% of its investment on 
Broadway and failed on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Sondheim's music and lyrics were acknowledged as sumptuous, intricate, clever 
and operatic -- but to what end? 
</P>
<P>
 Is "Sweeney" a tale of obsession, rage or class struggle? Yes, yes and yes, 
but after listening to it again and again with increasing awe, this critic 
humbly submits that it also is a play about love -- or rather the mayhem that 
can ensue when all healthy avenues of love are blocked from a passionate heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeney, a poor barber, loses his wife when the wealthy and privileged Judge 
Turpin and Beadle Bamford fancy her. They contrive to send him to prison for 
life on a trumped-up charge. He escapes 15 years later only to be told that his 
wife (who, as Sondheim's lyric goes, "was his reason and his life") is dead and 
his daughter, Joanna, is a ward of that same evil judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Moonlight, a plucky community theater now concluding its outdoor season in 
bucolic Brengle Terrace Park, puts a charged and angry piece of 1840s London on 
the stage, conveying the squalor, the desperation and the rage of those times. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the inspired direction of Ray Limon, who also choreographed, the 
thematic and musical elements meld into a disturbing, vibrant whole. 
Rich-voiced Joshua Fischel finds the secret to Todd's dark heart, conveys the 
anguish of the man's loss and shows how it filled him with a monumental rage 
and thirst for revenge.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Such darkness cries out for relief, and the production gets it from the 
perfect comic timing of Cathy Gene Greenwood's cheerful, amoral Mrs. Lovett, 
whose thrift inspires the idea of transforming Sweeney's victims into meat 
pies. 
</P>
<P>
 You just can't resist her delivery of "A Little Priest," a song about the 
people she plans to bake, particularly "the Politician so oily, it's served on 
a doily." 
</P>
<P>
 George Huttenbrauck brings a rich baritone to the evil Judge and Matthew 
Alexander sweet falsetto tones to the insufferable Beadle Bamford. Dawn Veree 
and John Bisom charm in the roles of the innocent, then desperate young lovers, 
Joanna and Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Stephens touches the heart as Tobias, the simple boy devoted to Mrs. 
Lovett and only gradually aware of the evil swirling around him. Jim Goodrich 
captures the slithering opportunism of Pirelli, the rival barber.  
</P>
<P>
 The musical interweavings match the emotional mazes for complexity. Conductor 
Ken Gammie and musical director Elan McMahan work wonders with principals and 
ensemble, keeping the lyrics and notes crystalline. 
</P>
<P>
 The main revolving set by Walter Huntoon and Proscenery Theatrical Design does 
the job, although less would have been more with the additional set pieces. 
Costume coordinators Carlotta Malone and Debe Eddo get the rags right; Ron 
Vodicka's lighting and Stephen Smith's sound are appropriately harsh. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sweeney Todd" is a rare treat that may shock those who attended Moonlight's 
more typical, family-oriented efforts earlier this summer: "Me and My Girl," 
"Fiddler on the Roof" and "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat."  
</P>
<P>
 Advice? Come prepared to enjoy the salty difference.

GOING BACK IN TIME WITH 'FROM ARAGON AND CASTILE'; ART REVIEW: LACMA'S 
EXHIBITION OF "TRIPTYCH WITH SCENES OF THE LIFE OF SAINT GEORGE" AND "THE LAST 
SUPPER" EVOKE A TIME WHEN MUSEUMS WERE PLACES OF CONTEMPLATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The fascination of art lies importantly in the way its objects come encrusted 
with history. Sometimes this patina of time is a visual distillation of the 
events of the artist's life, or of the roundelay of the object's proud 
possessors. Sometimes it is a narrative told by the work or the details of its 
physical reality, its medical history, so to speak. This is the account of the 
way it was made and the way it aged. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually the saga of an art object consists of all these threads intertwined. 
It is thus with the County Museum of Art's exhibition "From Aragon and Castile: 
The Restoration of Two Spanish Paintings From the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Art." 
</P>
<P>
 That it consists of just two pictures may come as a disappointment to viewers 
suckled on the last decade's cycle of opulent extravaganza. For those with 
longer memories it may evoke the days when museums were places of repose 
inhabited by objects to be cherished and contemplated. 
</P>
<P>
 The pictures are large and not particularly seductive, but compelling in their 
rarity and seasoned character. They've been recently cleaned and restored under 
the auspices of Joe Fronek, the museum's senior paintings conservator, who 
wrote the exhibition's informative brochure and organized the show in 
collaboration with curator of European painting and sculpture J. Patrice 
Marandel. It's always fascinating to see old pictures with the same eyes -- 
although not the same minds -- as did their original viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In style the eldest of the two is an early, anonymous, 15th-Century retablo or 
altarpiece, "Triptych With Scenes of the Life of Saint George." For senior L.A. 
art lovers it will evoke the ancient days when the museum was a cozy backwater 
tucked away in a corner of what is now the Museum of Natural History in 
Exposition Park. Its greatest claim to fame in those days was a substantial 
1950 gift of Old Master and antique art from publisher William Randolph Hearst. 
This painting was part of the gift and prominently on display. It was in such 
sorry shape it's never been shown in the Wilshire Boulevard facility. 
</P>
<P>
 New scholarship places its origin in the Huesca/Zaragosa region of Aragon. By 
advanced standards of the day the work is conservative, but details like the 
volumetric shading of the horse's body suggests slow absorption of the 
pictorial ideas of such pioneer Italians as Paulo Uccello. 
</P>
<P>
 The retablo most closely resembles an enlarged manuscript illumination with 
its contorted, stylized space and use of gold and silver leaf for effect. St. 
George really is a knight in dully shining armor. The whole has the hard 
enameled surface created by egg tempera on wood. The effect is decorative but 
with an Expressionist twist that would evolve into the particular Spanish 
aesthetic taste for realism and death. One dimly senses Goya lurking here. 
</P>
<P>
 The legend of St. George and the dragon has been so secularized as to become 
almost a fairy tale. The compartmentalized, quasi-comic-strip layout of this 
picture paints a bloodier business. His legend developed in Byzantium and did 
include the rescue of a princess who was to be sacrificed to a dragon that held 
her kingdom in thrall. By tradition, St. George so cowed the beast the princess 
was able to lead him away like a lap dog on a leash and the saintly knight gave 
his reward to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 The familiar event is depicted, but so is the often-forgotten part of the 
story that identifies the saint as a passionate Christian who lived under the 
violently anti-Christian Roman emperors Diocletian and Maximian. When the Roman 
consul arrested him for outspoken belief, the saint refused to recant and was 
therefore rewarded with torture before being beheaded. 
</P>
<P>
 By coincidence the other painting on view also involves a woman in distress. 
This time it is Mary Magdalen who lies prostrate before Jesus and his disciples 
in Pedro Berruguete's "The Last Supper," a recent gift from the Ahmanson 
Foundation. Painted near the end of the century it shows strong marks of 
Renaissance influence. The most physically striking are its size and texture. 
Near 6-by-10 feet, it echoes contemporary taste for heroic fresco painting. It 
imitates the dry, matte surface of wall painting using water-and-glue-base 
paint on linen known in Spain as Sarga. Evidently painted with the idea they 
would stay put, such pictures are rarely seen on account of their fragility. 
The only other such examples confidently ascribed to the artist are in Madrid's 
Prado museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other Spanish artists of his time, Berruguete left little 
biographical detail. It's known he worked at the Italian court of Federico de 
Montefeltro in Urbino in 1477. The style of the painting echoes an Italian 
taste for Northern European art, then both refined and earthy. 
</P>
<P>
 A Gothic majesty of composition reflects in the frontal, symmetrical ranking 
of the figures. Jesus sits at its apex gesturing like an icon. By contrast the 
rendering of the disciples' faces is tough and weathered. They look like 
workmen against their gold-leaf halos. The picture joins its predecessor in 
reminding us that death is near and intensely physical in the doing. 
</P>

SCREENING ROOM: 'GHOST STORY' TO END HONG KONG SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Monica 4-Plex concludes its Hong Kong Premiere Showcase series Wednesday 
with a one-week run of Nam Lai-Choi's naughty and charming period piece "Erotic 
Ghost Story" (Monica 4-Plex), which features three ravishing Chinese "fox 
fairy" sisters -- So-so (Man Su), Fei-fei (Kyoko Kamimura) and Hua-hua (Amy 
Yip). They've been granted exquisite mortal form in return for doing good 
deeds, but they've just entered a 36-day probationary period, the end of which 
they will drop their "human frames" and achieve immortality. However, if they 
do not remain virtuous during this time they will revert to being foxes. 
</P>
<P>
 This proves quite a challenge for these deeply sensual women, who occupy a 
lavish townhouse but encounter a handsome young scholar, Wu Ming (Pal Shin), 
who's holed up in a ramshackle cottage in the woods studying for his exams. In 
very short order we're wondering how Wu and the sisters are ever going to pass 
their respective tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Erotic Ghost Story" hasn't the style and sophistication of "Sex and Zen" (in 
which the statuesque Yip starred) and in fact has some of the cornball humor of 
martial arts comedies. But it is genuinely erotic in the best sense: clearly 
Nam Lai-Choi not only adores but respects women -- his film could even be said 
to have a feminist sensibility, acknowledging women's intelligence and 
self-determination as well as their sexuality.  
</P>

 Nam celebrates the physical beauty of his stars, who wear enough gorgeous silk 
and chiffon to encircle the globe. "Erotic Ghost Story" is not hard core, but 
it's a scorcher, with its ample nudity and lovemaking presented tastefully. 
(310) 394-9741. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigol Bezjian's "Chickpeas" (opening Friday at the Los Feliz 3 for a one-week 
run), which premiered at last year's AFI Filmfest, is sincere in the best sense 
of the word. Writer-director Bezjian, in his feature debut, follows the lives 
of three young Armenian refugees from Beirut -- played by Nazareth Kurdoghlian, 
Raffi Bekmezdjian and Khoren Ekmekjian -- struggling to make new lives for 
themselves within the self-enclosed world of Los Angeles' Armenian community.  
</P>
<P>
 There's a universality to their immigrant story in not only trying to 
establish their own business but also in confronting the usual conflicts 
between ways old and new. The film's lack of professional polish fortunately 
coincides with rather than contradicts its material, and on the whole it is a 
warm, occasionally ruefully humorous and engrossing experience. (213) 664-2169. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hard to believe that the Philippe Mora who has made such solid, 
straightforward pictures as the Great Depression documentary "Brother, Can You 
Spare a Dime?" and the Australian World War II courtroom drama "Death of a 
Soldier" is the same Mora who has written and directed the disastrous, 
self-indulgent "Art Deco Detective" (Sunset 5, Fridays and Saturdays at 
midnight). Pretentious, tedious and talky, it spoofs '40s private-eye capers 
while telling of yet another crazed nuclear terrorist (Stephen McHattie), who's 
threatening to blow up up L.A. while indulging in serial killings of 
prostitutes and pursuing his fixation with a Hollywood star.  
</P>
<P>
 Mora means to send up everything, contemporary paranoia and post-Cold War 
politics in particular, but it has all been done before and infinitely better. 
McHattie and Brion James, as a U.S. intelligence agent are strong, seasoned 
actors who've doubtlessly already moved on to better things. It's a shame, 
however, to have wasted such a clever title -- and the virile John Dennis 
Johnston in the title role as Hollywood detective Art Decowitz -- on this film. 
(213) 848-3500. 
</P>
<P>
 Note: The New Beverly Cinema will be presenting two masterpieces of the 
Japanese cinema. Kenji Mizoguchi's rapturous ghost story "Ugetsu" (1953) and 
Akira Kurosawa's strikingly original "Rashomon" (1951), which introduced 
Japanese movies to postwar American audiences, screen Wednesday and Thursday.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; DOWNY MILDEW HAS HAD BETTER NIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles group Downy Mildew played '60s-inspired pop with an eclectic twist 
Sunday at LunaPark, but it wasn't the greatest night for this band, which has 
gained the respect of many finicky underground music listeners. The quintet, 
which has been perfecting an enigmatic pop sound for nearly a decade now, 
seemed to just miss the mark Sunday, delivering bumpy versions of normally 
smooth songs and missing each other's musical cues by inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Homer, who sang in throaty vibratos and streamlined high pitches, played 
woozy slide guitar up against the weepy violin of Salvador Garza. In the rare 
moments when the two fused, the set had an enticingly surreal and psychedelic 
feel. Rich 12-string guitar by Charlie Baldonado (who sang a few numbers in a 
smooth, reserved tone) was also appealing, but seemed on the outside looking 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 But the problem was that the band only gelled during a few choice moments, so 
the show overall felt slightly askew. If the band members had just moved a 
little one way or the other, it would have all fallen into sync. LORRAINE ALI

TV REVIEW; 'ON OUR OWN' CAUGHT IN FAMILY TWIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Title this "The Attack of the Cutes." 
</P>
<P>
 ABC's "On Our Own' is one of those unredeemably awful comedy series that you 
can't envision anyone even writing, let alone selling to a network. Yet somehow 
here it is, in brain-lock not only with "Full House," its lead-in for tonight's 
premiere, but also with "America's Funniest Home Videos," which will be its 
lead-in when it moves to its regular time slot Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 More of a drag than even the Olsen twins of "Full House" are JoJo, Jazz, 
Jussie, Jurnee, Jake and Jocqui Smollett, who play six of the seven Jerricos, 
St. Louis siblings orphaned when their parents were killed in a car crash. 
Stand-up comic Ralph Louis Harris (are there any comedians left in clubs?) 
plays the seventh and eldest Jerrico, 20-year-old Josh. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the crisis: Without an adult relative to assume custody, the kids will 
be parceled out to foster homes. "Lady, please don't split us up," one of the 
smallest Jerricos begs the family's caseworker. "We all we got." 
</P>
<P>
 Josh's solution is to cross-dress, inventing an aunt he names Mama J -- shades 
of Mrs. Doubtfire. Although the sympathetic caseworker isn't fooled, she plays 
along, and her gullible supervisor buys the ruse, even asking Mama J out on a 
date. 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, they don't call it high jinks for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowning sequence -- meant to have us reaching for our hankies -- finds 
Josh alone in a room, speaking to a photograph of his dead parents. "Mom and 
Dad, I really miss you guys." 
</P>
<P>
 At this point you want to dynamite the show's writers, who are so shameless in 
their quest to manipulate that capital punishment seems appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 * "On Our Own" premieres at 8:30 tonight, then will be seen Sundays at 7:30 
p.m. on ABC (Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42).

GETTING INVOLVED: MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY; GUADALUPE CENTER HELPS 
NEEDY LATINOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When it started in 1948 out of a donation from prominent Canoga Park property 
owner Mary Logan Orcutt, the Guadalupe Center was intended to offer Latino 
migrant workers in the community something of a "country club" feeling, with 
recreational opportunities including a swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The swimming pool has been closed for years and today, the Guadalupe Center, 
run by Catholic Charities, is where 76-year-old Frank Romero and his wife, 
Maria, volunteer three mornings a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Guadalupe Center offers an emergency food pantry on Monday, Wednesday and 
Friday mornings, a thrift store and a senior nutrition program and serves as a 
meeting place for community groups, including Project Amigo and Project Amiga, 
which offer young people alternatives to gangs, drugs and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Romero handles applications for aid, and Maria helps hand out food. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to catch them in their lies," Frank Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
 A fraudulent claim is the exception. However, after Romero caught one woman 
collecting aid by hiding her husband's profitable work as a contractor, he 
hired the man to fix his wall damaged by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 For much of its history, the center has focused on offering youth activities, 
but in recent years it has been changing to provide a broad range of social 
services for the community, said Anastasia Rose, the center's director for a 
year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there would be more kids getting in trouble with the law" without the 
center, said Josephina Juarez, a parent active in the youth programs who also 
helps answer the phone in the Guadalupe Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Each Christmas, the Guadalupe Center runs an Adopt-A-Family program that 
distributes toys, food and help to about 300 needy families. Planning for that 
program begins in October. The center runs a Thanksgiving food program and a 
Christmas party, which had 500 children last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers answering the phones and working the front desk must speak both 
English and Spanish. They are also needed to help with fund raising, coaching 
sports teams, sorting clothing and other donated items, handling word 
processing, marketing and organizing a dinner dance in March. 
</P>
<P>
 The center also needs help for a cleanup day Sept. 17. For more information, 
call Rose at (818) 340-2050. 
</P>
<P>
 Loaves and Fishes, a food bank also affiliated with Catholic Charities, needs 
volunteers to help with bagging groceries, sorting donated clothing and 
interviewing poor and homeless clients when they come in asking for help. 
Bilingual volunteers are especially needed. Loaves and Fishes, open Mondays, 
Wednesdays and Fridays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., is at 14525 Delano St., Van 
Nuys. To volunteer, call Barbara Ausburn, director of volunteers, at (818) 
997-0943. Loaves and Fishes also operates at the Guadalupe Center in Canoga 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Visually Handicapped Adults of the Valley, a school for blind or visually 
impaired people in the San Fernando Valley, needs volunteers to help in the 
kitchen, hand out lunches and do other general volunteer work. They also need 
someone to teach a typing class on Tuesdays. The group, founded about 20 years 
ago, is open on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. They are 
looking especially for volunteers willing to make a commitment to show up once 
a week. The school is at 6565 Vesper Ave., Van Nuys. To volunteer, contact 
Helene Taber at (818) 988-2740. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Branch of the Orton Dyslexia Society in Studio City is 
looking for volunteers, preferably with a teaching background, for a low-cost 
reading clinic run by the Ryan Dyslexia Center. Volunteers would teach adults 
with dyslexia or related learning disabilities two hours a week in the 
evenings. Training will be provided. The Ryan Dyslexia Center is also looking 
for students for its literacy program. Please call Monday or Thursday between 
10 a.m. and 2 p.m. or leave a message at (818) 506-8866. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting Involved is a weekly listing of volunteering opportunities. Please 
address prospective listings to Getting Involved, Los Angeles Times, 20000 
Prairie St., Chatsworth, 91311. Or fax them to (818) 772-3338.

SCOTT HARRIS: STAR GOES TO BAT FOR CHILDREN WITH HIV; IN THE CONSERVATIVE, 
TRADITION-BOUND WORLD OF BASEBALL, BECK SAYS HE DREW A FEW PUZZLED LOOKS WHEN 
HE BECAME INVOLVED WITH AN AIDS CHARITY IN 1991. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There were four of us in the living room: Rod Beck, his pal Michael DeGrandis, 
myself and ESPN. We were talking baseball, which this year means talking about 
labor negotiations. We also talked about sick children. But even then, we were 
talking baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're a baseball fan, you probably are familiar with Beck. The San 
Francisco Giants star, a native of Van Nuys, may be the best reliever in the 
game. He and DeGrandis have been friends since the second grade. Time and again 
our attention would turn to the giant 60-inch TV screen in DeGrandis' Burbank 
home, waiting for ESPN, the all-sports channel, to provide updates on the 
baseball strike negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 If it weren't for this bizarre, maddening dispute between the haves and haves 
-- the only have-nots being the fans -- Beck would be with his team, not here. 
As one dismayed fan put it, taking sides in this feud is like choosing between 
Beavis and Butt-head. The owners' position, as a pundit noted, is: "Stop me 
before I spend again!" But it's hard to imagine Woody Guthrie singing about the 
plight of oppressed ballplayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Rodney Roy Beck -- this 26-year-old man with a million-dollar arm who 
happened to be my first-round pick in a fantasy baseball league -- could help 
me understand. 
</P>
<P>
 But the pitcher had something else on his mind. He wanted to talk about 
children infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, and a place 
called Camp Sunburst. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, to look at Rod Beck, this may seem an unlikely subject. He's a big man 
whose Fu Manchu mustache suggests a permanent scowl. With a few tattoos, he 
could blend right in with the Hells Angels. Orel Hershiser he's not. 
</P>
<P>
 But off the field, wearing a T-shirt that declares "Baseball Is Life," Beck 
speaks softly, promoting the crusade against HIV. This star on Grant High's 
city championship in 1986 was visiting the Valley to promote "Remember the 
Children," a daylong charity auction of sports and entertainment memorabilia 
scheduled for Nov. 13 at The Castaways in Burbank. Proceeds from the event, 
sponsored by the Burbank Board of Realtors, will benefit Sunburst Projects, a 
nonprofit agency that sponsors a family retreat in the Sierra foothills for 
children with HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a waiting list for Camp Sunburst, he says. "It's easy for a healthy 
family to send kids to summer camp. But the stigma attached to the disease, 
they can't go to regular summer camp." 
</P>
<P>
 The night before, Beck had plugged "Remember the Children" in an interview on 
ESPN. That morning, he gave a presentation on Camp Sunburst before the Burbank 
Board of Realtors. The next morning, he was planning to make his charity pitch 
on a morning drive-time radio program. 
</P>
<P>
 In the conservative, tradition-bound world of baseball, Beck says he drew a 
few puzzled looks when he became involved with an AIDS charity in 1991. Giants 
management was encouraging players to work in community causes, but a list that 
was circulated did not include any HIV agencies. With his wife, Stacey, Beck 
searched for an agency in which his involvement might make a difference, and 
hooked up with Sunburst. Since then, he's helped the agency by making public 
service announcements and personal appearances. More than $10,000 in donations 
have been raised in exchange for Rod Beck autographed photos. 
</P>
<P>
 They are now busy trying to enlist sports and entertainment figures in the 
cause. Beck's teammates Barry Bonds and Matt Williams, for example, have 
donated jerseys, and Wayne Gretzky has donated a hockey stick. The Burbank 
realtors are trying to drum up interest from Hollywood figures. Beck and 
DeGrandis are optimistic that event will raise money and consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more people who take a look at the disease, and a good look at 
themselves, they realize that this is something that affects everybody," Beck 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the only people who can stop it are the people here." 
</P>
<P>
 It may not have sounded like it, but we were still talking baseball. Babe 
Ruth, according to legend, would promise to hit a home run for a sick child -- 
and the Babe would deliver. This isn't so different. 
</P>
<P>
 Thankfully, baseball is a big subject. And as we waited for an update on 
negotiations from ESPN, we talked the way fans might. Beck, who grew up rooting 
for the Dodgers, pointed out that the Giants were trailing L. A. by only 3 1/2 
games when the season was halted -- "and our last three games are against L. 
A." He like the Giants' chances . . . if only the season would resume. 
</P>
<P>
 Then along came ESPN's Peter Gammons, larger than life on the 60-inch screen. 
The news, it seemed, was basically no news. The standstill continued. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon ESPN segued to another story -- a feature, as it happened, about Glenn 
Burke, a former Dodger outfielder who is broke and dying of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "How long was he in the majors?" asked the man in the "Baseball Is Life" 
T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 We weren't sure. However long Burke played, Beck figured, it wasn't long 
enough to qualify for a pension. 
</P>
<P>

BASEBALL SEASON AT END?; STRIKE: SELIG HOLDS OFF SETTING DATE FOR CALLING OFF 
THE REST OF THE CAMPAIGN ALTHOUGH WORD COULD -- COME AS SOON AS TODAY.

 Though Bud Selig won't be pinned down, the rest of baseball is braced for what 
may be inevitable: the cancellation of the season on Tuesday or Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unreal. I can't believe it," Atlanta Braves president Stan Kasten said. 
"We're about to lose the World Series." 
</P>
<P>
 But Selig, the acting commissioner, wouldn't establish a date for calling off 
one of the more memorable seasons in baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't give you a specific date because I don't know myself," said Selig, 
who last Friday allowed his initial deadline for canceling the season to pass. 
"We're just going to play it day by day." 
</P>
<P>
 Selig repeated an earlier statement that teams would not play the postseason 
unless the regular season was resumed. That means the World Series would be 
wiped out, too -- for the first time in 90 years. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he saw no harm in delaying a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort like taking chicken soup when you have a cold," he said. "Nothing 
bad can come from it. You keep trying because you hope there's some triggering 
mechanism that nobody's thought about." 
</P>
<P>
 But even Selig admitted, "We know it's a longshot." 
</P>
<P>
 Players, attending the union's executive board meeting in New York, said they, 
too, were prepared for a decision to cancel the Series. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think both sides will regret it if it happens," Hershiser said. "There will 
be extensive damage to the game, extensive damage to the season. It's a 
sobering thought." 
</P>
<P>
 Selig announced Sept. 2 the deadline for making a decision on the season -- 
and the World Series -- would be Sept. 9. Eugene Orza, the union's No. 2 
official, said Monday he thinks the sides have until Sept. 15 to 17 to reach an 
agreement that would allow regular-season games to resume and until "eight or 
nine days after that" to save the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no bargaining Monday as the strike passed its 32nd day, matching the 
1990 lockout as the second-longest work stoppage in major league history. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the level of telephone activity dropped. Owners conducted conference 
calls at midday and early evening, and the players' board met at night. 
</P>
<P>
 The only news came from Washington, where the House Judiciary Committee said 
its subcommittee on economic and commercial law will hold a hearing into 
baseball's antitrust exemption on Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing productive happening," Boston Red Sox chief executive officer 
John Harrington said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington and Kasten, who along with Colorado Rockies chairman Jerry McMorris 
tried to fashion a compromise last week, were back in their offices. "Nothing 
is happening that I'm aware of," union head Donald Fehr said before the 
players' meeting began. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners rejected the players' new "tax" plan last Friday, a day after it was 
proposed. According to Harrington and Kasten, the union said Saturday that it 
would not accept any "tax" that would restrain salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made it real clear they wouldn't entertain any such discussion," Kasten 
said. "Once it has real impact on salaries, they wouldn't discuss it." 
</P>
<P>
 Orza said that the union's statement didn't go as far as Kasten characterized 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players' association is not interested in discussing any proposal that 
had a pronounced or profound impact on the salary structure that exists in 
baseball," Orza said. 
</P>
<P>
 McMorris, checking his notes from the meetings, said Fehr told him: "The 
owners will not get this union to artificially hold down payrolls." 
</P>
<P>
 Before entering their board meeting, players said they were upset that 
management negotiators went home Saturday.

NFL PLAYERS SHARE IN RECORD SETTLEMENT; LABOR RELATIONS: $30-MILLION JUDGMENT 
ARISING FROM 1987 STRIKE WILL BE DIVIDED AMONG ABOUT 1,300. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 About 1,300 professional football players will share in a record $30-million 
settlement of charges arising from the 24-day NFL strike in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Labor Relations Board said Monday the agreement between the NFL 
Players Assn. and the NFL Management Council is the largest such award in NLRB 
history. The settlement includes backpay, incentive bonuses and interest. 
</P>
<P>
 A breakdown of how much players from each of the 28 teams would receive was 
not available Monday, but the agency said distribution of the award was 
expected within a couple of months. The NLRB said further details are to be 
announced at a news conference today.  
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate reaction from the Players Assn.  
</P>
<P>
 But the management council attempted to play down the settlement, saying the 
award was "part of the $195-million overall settlement that the NFL reached 
with its players' union in January 1993." 
</P>
<P>
 After receiving a complaint from the NFLPA, the NLRB had ruled the council and 
NFL teams had unlawfully refused to allow returning players to participate in 
games immediately after the end of the strike Oct. 15.

 "The board found that the denial of the returning strikers the right to play 
or be paid, as well as other acts by league management such as withholding game 
checks for certain injured-reserve players, constituted unfair labor practices 
in violation of the National Labor Relations Act," NLRB general counsel Fred 
Feinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the NLRB upheld the initial ruling by an administrative law judge, the 
team owners appealed to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia, which had the decision under review. 
</P>
<P>
 "This settlement would obviate the need for any additional proceedings before 
the circuit court," said David Parker, the NLRB director of information. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike began Sept. 22 after the NFLPA and the management council were 
unable to agree on several issues, including free agency in which players would 
be able to sell their services to the highest bidder after the end of their 
current contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 In its decision in September 1992, the NLRB found the owners had adopted a 
rule about two weeks into the strike requiring any player wanting to play in a 
Sunday or Monday game immediately following a settlement or end of the strike 
to report to work by 1 p.m. on the previous Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, replacement players could be signed to play in Sunday games as late 
as 4 p.m. on the Saturday before the games and in Monday night games as late as 
4 p.m. on the same day, the NLRB said. It noted the players had unconditionally 
ended the strike on Oct. 15.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; 49ERS LOSE DENT FOR MOST OF SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Francisco 49ers Coach George Seifert said defensive end Richard Dent, one 
of the team's most important offseason acquisitions, tore his right medial 
collateral ligament during a fourth-quarter pileup in Sunday's 24-17 loss at 
Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Dent was expected to undergo surgery as early as Tuesday and could miss most 
of the year. Seifert said the team hoped Dent could return late in the season 
but that determination couldn't be made until six weeks into his 
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Left guard Jesse Sapolu pulled his right hamstring while blocking on a field 
goal try Sunday and will miss Sunday's game against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers (1-1) have lost four starters to injury in the first two games, 
including three members of the offensive line. Sapolu joins tackle Harris 
Barton (torn triceps) and guard Ralph Tamm (torn arch) on the sidelines. Sapolu 
and Barton each went to the Pro Bowl last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Barton, expected to miss up to 10 weeks, and Tamm, out indefinitely, both were 
hurt in San Francisco's opening 44-14 win over the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New Orleans Saints running back Mario Bates, the No. 2 draft pick this year, 
will miss up to six weeks after having his jaw broken by teammate Lorenzo Neal. 
</P>
<P>
 Bates and Neal went out after the Saints' 38-24 loss to the Washington 
Redskins on Sunday night, ending up at Club 57, a lounge owned by former Saints 
linebacker Rickey Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neither one of them are quite sure as to exactly what happened," coach Jim 
Mora said. "Things got out of hand and we've got a player with a broken jaw." 
</P>
<P>
 Bates was hospitalized Monday to have the jaw surgically repaired. Mora said 
the extent of the injury is not known. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing further that's going to occur from a standpoint of hard 
feelings," Mora said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident happened after midnight inside the club, Mora said. He said he 
did not think the players were drunk, but said they did not know what prompted 
Neal to hit Bates. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A broken collarbone probably will sideline Detriot Lions wide receiver Anthony 
Carter for at least six to eight weeks. Carter, a key veteran addition to a 
promising wide receiving corps, broke his collarbone and scapula during 
Sunday's 10-3 loss at Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, in his 10th NFL season, sustained the injury on his only reception of 
the game -- an 18-yard gain over the middle in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Receiver Johnnie Morton, the Lions' first-round draft choice out of USC, was 
not active for Sunday's game. With Carter out, Morton could be in uniform for 
Monday's game at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Giants running back Rodney Hampton could be sidelined two to three weeks after 
injuring his kidney and back during New York's 20-17 victory over the Phoenix 
Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Hampton remained hospitalized Monday in Phoenix. He sustained a bruised kidney 
and back contusions Sunday when he took a helmet to the back on a tackle midway 
through the third quarter. Hampton is tentatively scheduled to return to New 
York on Wednesday or Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers put defensive tackle Blaise Winter (broken left leg) and punter 
John Kidd (hamstring) on injured reserve, meaning they're lost for the season. 
They replaced Winter by agreeing to terms with John Parrella, a second-round 
draft pick of the Buffalo Bills in 1993. The Chargers haven't replaced Kidd 
yet, but have been speaking with seven-year veteran Bryan Wagner, who most 
recently was with Green Bay. . . . Cardinal coach Buddy Ryan said he will 
announce Wednesday whether Jim McMahon, Steve Beuerlein or Jay Schroeder will 
start at quarterback. McMahon replaced Beuerlein during a 20-17 loss to the New 
York Giants last Sunday. . . . Buffalo left tackle John Fina sprained his knee 
against New England and might not be ready for Sunday's game at Houston. . . . 
Miami rookie running back Irving Spikes, who came off the bench to gain 70 
yards in 13 carries at Green Bay, might miss the Jets' game with a strained 
right medial collateral ligament suffered on his final carry Sunday. . . . The 
Cowboys got good news when a feared ligament tear in wide receiver-kick 
returner Kevin Williams' right knee turned out to be just a severe sprain.

 6-Month T-Bills Hit 3-Year High: The Treasury Department sold $11.6 billion of 
new three-month bills at an average discount rate of 4.61%, up from 4.58% last 
week. Another $11.7 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average 
discount rate of 4.99%, up from 4.89%.The three-month bill rate was the highest 
since Aug. 22, when they sold for 4.62%. The six-month bill rate was the 
highest since Oct. 28, 1991, when they averaged 5.04%. The new discount rates 
understate the actual return to investors: 4.73% for three-month bills, with a 
$10,000 bill selling for $9,883.50, and 5.19% for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,747.70. The discount rate reflects the price discount received when 
government securities are purchased at less than face value.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; STOCKS PRESSED BY WARY MOOD; DOW FALLS 14.47 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks fell in sluggish trading Monday as investors worried that new 
government data on inflation would lead to higher interest rates and lower 
corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed 14.47 points lower at 3,860.34. In the 
broader market, declining issues outnumbered advancing ones about 13 to 7 on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Many investors held back from making any significant commitment, anticipating 
today's release of data on August consumer prices. Traders were looking for 
confirmation that the inflation rate may be picking up, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is waiting to see what the numbers will be," said Peter Canelo, 
chief investment strategist at NatWest Securities Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the report of higher-than-expected prices at the wholesale level in 
August pushed bond yields sharply higher and helped to depress stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Treasury bond yields continued to edge upward, with the 30-year 
bond yield closing at 7.71%, up from 7.70%. The bond's price, which moves in 
the opposite direction, plunged 1 5/8 points Friday, off another 1/8 point, or 
$1.25 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market selloff in the last two trading sessions has intensified 
speculation among traders that the Treasury market is about to break out of a 
five-month trend that has confined prices and yields within a narrow range. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors worry, Canelo said, that the Federal Reserve will feel compelled to 
nudge interest rates upward for a sixth time this year to cool economic growth 
and hold back inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond investors worry about rising prices eroding the value of fixed-income 
securities such as bonds. Stock investors don't like to see interest rates rise 
because it increases the cost of business borrowing and makes shares less 
attractive relative to interest-bearing investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk of further credit-tightening action has prompted concern about slowing 
the economy too much, said Don Hays, investment strategist at Wheat First 
Butcher Singer. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks of companies most sensitive to the economic cycles -- such as heavy 
machinery, papers and chemicals -- tumbled as investors worried about the 
effects of higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, given the worries about inflation and Friday's poor performance, stocks 
held up well, said Alfred Goldman, director of technical market analysis with 
A. G. Edwards & Sons. 
</P>
<P>
 "That shows this is just a normal pause after a good summer rally," Goldman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Borden rose 2 to 13 5/8. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Borden agreed in 
principle on a KKR partnership's acquisition of all Borden's outstanding common 
stock in exchange for RJR Nabisco Holdings common stock owned by the 
partnership valued at $14 1/4 per share of Borden. RJR fell 3/8 to 6 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * GenCare Health Systems rallied 6 1/2 to 46 after United HealthCare Corp. 
said it planned to acquire GenCare for about $520 million in cash. United 
HealthCare fell 3/4 to 53. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nashua tumbled 3 5/8 to 25 1/2 after it said it expected a drop in 
third-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * MGM Grand rose 2 1/8 to 30 3/8, boosted by an Oppenheimer upgrade to analyst 
"buy" from "market performer." 
</P>
<P>
 * Amgen rose 1 1/2 to 53 1/8. Smith Barney said it upgraded its rating on the 
biotechnology company's stock to "buy" from "outperform." 
</P>
<P>
 * Stop & Shop gained 1 1/8 to 26 7/8 after posting a rise in second-quarter 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Caterpillar fell 1 7/8 to 53 1/2; International Paper dropped 1 5/8 to 72 
7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks, mostly concentrated on the smaller-capitalization Nasdaq 
index, were also hurt by worries about the economy. Intel dropped 1 1/4 to 64 
1/2; Cirrus Logic fell 1 1/4 to 30 in active trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Board volume retreated to 244.68 million shares from 294.32 million shares 
traded in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks ended mixed abroad. Frankfurt's 30-share DAX average closed 30.54 
points off at 2,154.61. Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average closed 19.40 points 
higher at 19,917.28. In London, the FTSE-100 average closed 10.5 points lower 
at 3,128.8. Mexico City's Bolsa index fell 46.56 points to 2,708.79. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other major market indicators, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks 
fell 1.97 points to 466.21; the NYSE's composite index fell 1.06 points to 
257.32. The Nasdaq composite index, meanwhile, dropped 3.72 points to 760.01. 
On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 0.52 point to 
455.06. 
</P>
<P>
 In the currency markets, the dollar fell to a two-month low against the 
British pound after England's central bank raised a key interest rate for the 
first time in nearly five years. The dollar closed at 99.13 Japanese yen, down 
from 99.15 Friday, and rose to 1.541 German marks from 1.538 marks. 
</P>
<P>
 England's rake hike attracted investors to higher-yielding British bonds and 
raised demand for sterling. In New York, the pound fetched $1.5700, up from 
$1.5525 on Friday.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: WARNER BROS. SCALES THE GREAT WALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hollywood always talks about respecting the "Chinese Wall" that exists in deal 
making. Now it's broken one down. Warner Bros. on Monday announced a landmark 
agreement to distribute movies in China, home to the world's largest film 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 An unspecified number of Warner movies will be shown in key Chinese cities 
beginning this fall under the "experimental" agreement with China Film 
Distribution, Exhibition, Export & Import Corp., the communist country's sole 
film importation agency. If the partnership succeeds, other Hollywood studios 
are expected to follow Warner's lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood sees China as one of the last great frontiers and is committed to 
building the movie theaters needed to bring it into the modern age. But 
analysts caution that the market won't spring to life overnight. Sources 
estimate that fewer than 8,000 of the country's movie screens meet U.S. 
standards, and the average ticket price is said to be about 50 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, a lot of films could also be turned away because of China's rigid 
social policies. Still, with its 1.2 billion people, it's an irresistible 
target. "Everybody wants to get into China," said entertainment analyst Jeffrey 
Logsdon of Seidler Cos. "It's an enormous market." 
</P>
<P>
 The Warner Bros. agreement is the result of a months-long initiative by 
co-Chairmen Robert Daly and Terry Semel and other executives who traveled to 
Beijing in April. Warner executives declined to comment further on the deal 
Monday, apparently out of concern for cultural sensitivities. In its formal 
announcement, Warner said it will split the revenue from its films shown in 
China with China Film. It will also open a China office. 
</P>
<P>
 One issue the distribution agreement does not address is piracy. Motion 
Picture Assn. of America President Jack Valenti says the practice is still "out 
of control" in China, but he added that the Warner deal could encourage the 
Chinese to take measures to protect "legitimate product."

 When Merritt Blake, Tom Chasin, Martin Hurwitz and Marion Rosenberg started 
meeting regularly for breakfast last year, people assumed they were negotiating 
a merger of their four talent agencies. But it turns out that something more 
aberrant was happening: a collaboration. 
</P>
<P>
 Forgoing Hollywood's usual obsession with secrecy, the four agents are 
informally trading information and insights as a way to better survive in a 
jungle dominated by behemoths such as Creative Artists Agency, International 
Creative Management and William Morris Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 During twice-monthly meetings at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel, they tip 
one another to upcoming business opportunities. They also trade industry gossip 
and have even held some meetings with TV and studio executives as a team. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an alternative," says Blake, whose clients include Tyne Daly and 
Wilford Brimley. "It's a window for information a small agency might not 
receive." 
</P>
<P>
 One recent case of cooperation involved Rosenberg and Hurwitz. When Rosenberg 
sold the rights to the book "Swift Justice" to CBS, Hurwitz brought in his 
client, best-selling author Joseph Wambaugh, to write the teleplay. In another 
instance, Blake turned to Hurwitz for help in structuring an executive producer 
deal for Daly, who had come to him with an idea for a TV pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurwitz says they've had no complaints. "A client has to be self-confident to 
be with an independent agent to begin with," he said. "And as agents, we all 
respect each other and are very secure about our relationships and individual 
businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg, whose clients include "Basic Instinct" director Paul Verhoeven, 
says the partnership also makes it easier to stay current in an era of agency 
consolidation and emerging technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 All four say they've turned down other agents' requests to join their grown-up 
version of The Breakfast Club. Chasin maintains that the partnership works 
because they started as friends and remain close, even though they see no point 
in formally joining their businesses. "We're basically lone wolves," he said. 
</P>
<P>

 As part of a revised marketing strategy, Walt Disney Co. has come up with a 
new name for its troubled Euro Disney theme park: Disneyland Paris. By 
symbolically linking the massive park to the City of Light, Disney hopes to 
attract more tourists staying in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Euro Disney, which is roughly 45 minutes outside of Paris, will keep that 
corporate name but will be called Disneyland Paris in promotions. To boost 
off-season attendance, Disney is also planning seasonal themes. This autumn's 
will be "Festival Far West," with Disneyland Paris offering country music 
concerts and promoting the park's cowboy-theme amenities, according to the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 A theme at a theme park seems natural enough, though Disney has been tripped 
up by the cowboy motif before. When the park opened several years ago, a 
doorman dressed as a fashionable ranch hand was supposed to greet arriving 
hotel guests with a hearty "Howdy!" The problem was, in his heavily accented 
English, everyone thought he was yelling "Audi!"

 Compulsive, narcissistic, brilliant and episodically mad, Nikola Tesla arrived 
in New York in 1884 at the age of 28, ready to electrify the world. Certainly a 
great inventor, Tesla, like many of his contemporaries, was psychologically 
enmeshed in the mystique of electricity.  
</P>
<P>
 Having figured out that alternating current (AC) is more efficient than the 
direct current (DC) Thomas Alva Edison favored, Tesla convinced George 
Westinghouse of the advantages of his approach. Westinghouse went AC when he 
built the first major hydroelectric plant at Niagara Falls. Tesla continued to 
dream of and patent things electric. He was an impresario of electricity, as 
his high-frequency "Tesla Coil" (made famous by the Frankenstein films) 
attests. 
</P>
<P>
 Tesla's family included his father, a member of the clergy, and a brilliant 
brother six years his senior, who died in an accident at the age of 11. That 
tragedy, says Tad Wise, author of the fictional biography "Tesla," shaped 
Tesla's life. Blaming himself for his brother's death, Tesla eventually left 
home for the university, left his church for home-brewed mysticism, and left 
Serbia for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 His American career spanned six decades, mostly spent in New York. Wise's 
descriptions of that city, especially in the gilded age, are the best parts of 
this very uneven book. Soon after his arrival, Tesla managed to meet, and 
briefly work for, Edison. He went on to have business deals with Westinghouse 
and J.P. Morgan, and to befriend Samuel Clemens (a.k.a. Mark Twain). 
</P>
<P>
 Tesla prospered, at first in the economic free-for-all at the end of the 19th 
Century. During his roller-coaster career he was a victim of both chance and 
his stubborn, idiosyncratic and enigmatic character. He made and lost fortunes, 
lived and dined in hotels from the Waldorf Astoria to nameless flea traps, all 
the while retaining a clique of devoted and wealthy friends. 
</P>
<P>
 He also collected enemies. His list begins with Edison and includes Guglielmo 
Marconi, who thought he could send messages through the air without wires and, 
of course, succeeded. Wise blames these foes, as well as society, for refusing 
to credit Tesla for the invention of, among other things, the science of 
robotics and X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
 What Tesla did not actually invent, according to Wise, he predicted. His 
prophesies include sonar, anti-missile systems, television and CNN. These were 
excellent forecasts, but not unique to Tesla. Another prophet at the time was 
H.G. Wells.  
</P>
<P>
 Tesla was a giant, literally -- he loomed well over six feet -- and 
figuratively -- he dreamed of domesticating the electrical power of the 
universe. In his private life he remained celibate, loathe to so much as touch 
another human being. He had no love life, although he liked to have beautiful 
women around him. This much is fact.  
</P>
<P>
 Wise, however, decided to tell Tesla's story as fiction, gaining a free hand 
to embroider the only non-technical part of Tesla's life of any interest -- his 
eccentricities and hallucinations. Wise provides psychological explanations for 
some and a paranormal gloss for others. 
</P>
<P>
 The lines between what is documented and what are from Wise's imagination are 
hard to draw. That's the trouble with fictionalized biography. Wise the 
novelist never stands back from his against-the-wall defense of his strange 
hero. Although Tesla's manic genius left no room for self-doubt, Wise the 
novelist could have been more critical.  
</P>
<P>
 For the record, Tesla did not discover X-rays. Like others who were 
experimenting with electricity, he accidentally took an X-ray picture, but was 
unaware of what he had done. As for the Nobel Prize of 1915, which was said to 
have originally been destined to be split between Edison and Tesla but went 
instead to William H. and William L. Bragg, there is nothing mysterious about 
it. Rumors are common in Nobel-land. Had Wise wanted to find out whether the 
Nobel Prize Committee had ever considered the American inventors, he simply 
could have consulted the minutes of those meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 What Wise has failed to do, as biographer or novelist, is explain how Nikola 
Tesla reflected the spirit of his age. His genius for electrical inventions, 
for instance, was a perfect fit for a continent in the throes of urbanization. 
And Tesla's approach, bizarre to the point of demented, could be tolerated in 
the age of rampant individualism. 
</P>
<P>
 In the book's epilogue, Wise lists materials that have become available to 
researchers; he recuses himself from exploring them, however, on the grounds 
that this is not the novelist's job. Instead, he berates "scientists and 
historians" for having shirked their duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankly, this fictional biography would have been a fine venue for a survey of 
those new materials. Without it, Wise adds only a weak "gee whiz" to what is 
already known about this strange and brilliant figure.

 The crew of a fishing boat near Boca Raton, Fla., made a surprising catch 
recently -- three bales containing almost 200 pounds of cocaine, with an 
estimated value of more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 While waiting for the Coast Guard, one angler tried to fish but had no luck 
even though the bales had attracted a lot of fish. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fish must have been paranoid," he told the Ft. Lauderdale Sun Sentinel. 
"I think they were wired from all that cocaine."

 I used to think David Stern was hot stuff. . . .

 Now I think he is a menace to sports. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It was NBA Commissioner Stern who invented the salary cap. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 For this, he was hailed as a genius who was greatly responsible for the 
unprecedented success of pro basketball. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, but Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird deserved the credit. .

</P>
<P>
 Now the baseball owners think Stern's salary cap is the solution to whatever 
problems -- real or imagined -- they might have. . . .

<P>
 This is why the most ridiculous labor dispute in history -- the billionaire 
owners vs. themselves and the millionaire ballplayers -- is about to shut down 
the World Series. . . .

 It has ruined a great season that was packed with record attempts and other 
exceptional performances by ballplayers who were on the brink of becoming the 
Jordans, Johnsons and Birds of their sport. . . .

 Smith made the first down and the Seahawks eventually scored a touchdown to 
extend their lead to 17-3 in the third quarter. . . .

undrafted and then led the Miami Dolphins to their victory over Green Bay on 
Sunday. . . .

 Two years ago, the Raiders took running back Greg Robinson from Northeast 
Louisiana.He was hitting his stride last year when he suffered a knee injury

 If the NFL wants to add another rule favoring the offense, how about stopping 
the clock after every first down like they do in college? . . .

<TEXT>
<P>
 The USC-Baylor game on Sept. 24, originally scheduled for 12:30 p.m. at the 
Coliseum, will instead have a 7 p.m. kickoff to accommodate a telecast by Prime 
Ticket. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 A bye week couldn't be more opportune for the Trojans' pass offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach John Robinson's receiver corps has injury problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receivers Ed Hervey and Keyshawn Johnson didn't play in a 38-14 loss to 
Penn State and tight ends Tyler Cashman and John Allred had sat out a combined 
two weeks of practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Leonard Green, expected to be a key player in the pass offense, has 
been slowed by a stubborn hamstring pull for weeks and played only briefly 
Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
 "Once we get these guys healed up, we'll get caught up," Robinson said. "We're 
not as bad as we looked." EARL GUSTKEY

<P>
 Raider cornerback Albert Lewis, who suffered a concussion in the third quarter 
of Sunday's loss to the Seattle Seahawks, reported nothing worse than a 
headache Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked after Sunday's game if he remembered the play on which he collided with 
teammate Eddie Anderson, Lewis replied, "I don't remember the second half." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lewis remembered quite well Monday after sitting through a team 
tongue-lashing by Coach Art Shell and a horror movie -- the lowlights of 
Sunday's 38-9 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Was Shell hard on the team? 
</P>
<P>
 "You might say that," Lewis said, "but it was very much necessary. Today's a 
day when everybody's fairly disappointed. That's what happens when you lose to 
a team that's not as good as you and you lose big to them. They were better 
that particular day and that's what matters most." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Harvey Williams has a jammed left hand, suffered on the opening 
kickoff Sunday. But Williams, who is not expected to sit out, was more focused 
Monday on the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't sleep a wink last night," he said, "and I'm pretty sure 98% of the 
football team didn't sleep." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Defensive lineman Scott Davis, who walked out of the team's training 
headquarters last week, remained among the missing for the seventh consecutive 
day. . . . Fellow defensive lineman Jerry Ball, who suffered a pulled hamstring 
Sunday, is expected to play Sunday against the Denver Broncos at Denver. STEVE

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; UCLA; STOKES EXPECTED TO PLAY ON SATURDAY 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a dull offensive effort that both quarterback Wayne Cook and Coach Terry 
Donahue said could have been brightened by the presence of wide receiver J.J. 
Stokes, Donahue said Monday that he expected to have Stokes back for Saturday's 
game at Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes suffered a bruised thigh on the second play of the season-opening 
victory against Tennessee, and though he said he would play against Southern 
Methodist on Saturday, was unable to do so.Without the biggest of their 
big-play men, the Bruins staggered to a 17-10 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's certainly much closer to playing now," Donahue said. "By Wednesday or 
Thursday, we'll know." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue said that sophomore Andy Colbert will replace senior Carl Greenwood at 
cornerback after Greenwood suffered a broken right ankle Saturday. . . . Chad 
Overhauser, a redshirt freshman, stepped in for Paul Kennedy when he suffered a 
knee injury. Kennedy, a senior, is sidelined for the season, leaving the Bruins 
shallow on the offensive line. JIM HODGES

 Seahawk Coach Tom Flores didn't like the way the Raiders treated his 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 A television replay showed that Raider linebacker Winston Moss punched Rick 
Mirer in the chin several times as the quarterback lay on the ground after 
being tackled by Moss in the second quarter. Moss was not penalized. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's uncalled for," Flores said Monday. "There's no place for that in 
professional football." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident touched off a free-for-all that brought the ejections of Raider 
defensive linemen Chester McGlockton and Aundray Bruce and Seahawk offensive 
tackle Ray Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores defended Roberts, who pushed Moss off Mirer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure there isn't anybody (on the Seahawks) who wouldn't do the same 
thing," Flores said.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; LONEKER WILL GO ON INJURED RESERVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Starting left guard Keith Loneker is expected to go on the injured-reserve 
list and undergo surgery for a fallen left arch, Coach Chuck Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Loneker, a second-year player, injured his arch in the Rams' 31-13 loss at 
Atlanta on Sunday.Tom Newberry, the starting left guard last season and the 
backup center to Bern Brostek this year, is expected to replace Loneker. 
</P>
<P>
 Loneker's injury also will mean more playing time for Chuck Belin. The Rams 
projected big things from Belin during the exhibition season but he has been 
inactive for the first two regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox also said the team might explore signing a free agent offensive lineman 
to add depth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ram quarterback Chris Miller, asked if he would have wanted to stay in Atlanta 
rather than sign with the Rams in the off-season: "I would have liked to play 
for (Atlanta Coach) June Jones. I like the city here. . . . but things change 
-- I'm out West for at least a year, until we get shipped out somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tank Younger, Tex Schramm, Tom Fears and Elroy Hirsch are among 14 former Ram 
players who will serve as honorary captains at the coin toss of Sunday's game 
against San Francisco at Anaheim Stadium. The Rams will wear replica uniforms 
from their 1951 NFL championship season in Sunday's "throwback game" to honor 
the 75th anniversary of the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Ram players also will be honored in a halftime ceremony. MIKE

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; 49ERS LOSE DENT FOR MOST OF SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Francisco 49er Coach George Seifert said defensive end Richard Dent, one 
of the team's most important off-season acquisitions, suffered a knee injury 
during a fourth-quarter pileup in Sunday's 24-17 loss to the Kansas City 
Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dent was expected to undergo surgery as early as today and might sit out most 
of the season. Seifert said the team hoped Dent could return late in the season 
but that determination couldn't be made until six weeks into his 
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Left guard Jesse Sapolu suffered a pulled right hamstring while blocking on a 
field-goal try Sunday and will sit out Sunday's game against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers (1-1) have lost four starters to injury in the first two games, 
including three members of the offensive line. Sapolu joins tackle Harris 
Barton and guard Ralph Tamm on the sidelines. Sapolu and Barton each went to 
the Pro Bowl last year. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 New Orleans Saint running back Mario Bates, a second-round draft pick this 
year, will be sidelined about six weeks after having his jaw broken by teammate 
Lorenzo Neal. 
</P>
<P>
 Bates and Neal went out after the Saints' 38-24 loss to the Washington 
Redskins on Sunday, ending up at Club 57, a lounge owned by former Saint 
linebacker Rickey Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neither one of them are quite sure as to exactly what happened," Coach Jim 
Mora said. "Things got out of hand and we've got a player with a broken jaw." 
</P>
<P>
 Bates was hospitalized Monday to have the jaw surgically repaired. Mora said 
the extent of the injury is not known. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing further that's going to occur from a standpoint of hard 
feelings," Mora said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident happened after midnight inside the club, Mora said. He said he 
did not think the players were drunk, but said they did not know what prompted 
Neal to hit Bates. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A broken collarbone probably will sideline Detroit Lion wide receiver Anthony 
Carter for at least six weeks. Carter, a key veteran addition to a promising 
wide receiving corps, suffered a broken collarbone and scapula during Sunday's 
10-3 loss to the Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
 Former USC receiver Johnnie Morton, the Lions' first-round draft choice out, 
was not active for Sunday's game. With Carter out, Morton could be in uniform 
for Monday's game against the Cowboys at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New York Giant running back Rodney Hampton could be sidelined two to three 
weeks after suffering kidney and back injuries during Sunday's 20-17 victory 
over the Arizona Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego Chargers put defensive tackle Blaise Winter and punter John Kidd 
on injured reserve, meaning they're sidelined for the season. The Charger 
replaced Winter by agreeing to terms with John Parrella, a second-round draft 
pick of the Buffalo Bills in 1993. The Chargers haven't replaced Kidd, but have 
been speaking with seven-year veteran Bryan Wagner. . . . Cardinal Coach Buddy 
Ryan said he will announce Wednesday whether Jim McMahon, Steve Beuerlein or 
Jay Schroeder will start at quarterback. McMahon replaced Beuerlein during a 
20-17 loss to the New York Giants on Sunday. . . . Miami Dolphin rookie running 
back Irving Spikes, who came off the bench to gain 70 yards in 13 carries at 
Green Bay, might sit out the Jets' game this week because of a strained right 
medial collateral ligament suffered Sunday.

 Coach: Jim Schultz (first year). 
</P>
<P>
 1993: 16-2, 9-1; lost to Laguna Beach in the Southern Section Division II 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Brandi Freudenberg, Sr., advanced to section singles semifinals 
last year, will play No. 1 singles; Holli Freudenberg, So., will play No. 2 or 
No. 3 singles; Talline Kojian, So., will play doubles; Amy Medlin, Jr., will 
play No. 2 or No. 3 singles; Julie Yoshikawa, Sr., will play doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Yu Chang, Jr., will play doubles; Susanne Cowan, So., will play 
doubles; Kellie Medigovich, So., will play doubles with junior Anjula Narang; 
Mary Rasch, Sr., will play doubles; Joanna Zafra, Jr., will play doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Usually when coaches retire, they leave the cupboard bare for the new 
coach. Not in this case. Art Green left Schultz, his assistant of three years, 
perhaps the most talented team in the county. Schultz says the Freudenberg 
sisters and Medlin are playing the best tennis of their lives. If the young 
doubles teams come together, El Modena will challenge for the Division II 
title.

</P>
<P>
 1993: 22-3, 10-0 in Pacific Coast League; Division II champion for the second 
consecutive year, beating Edison, 11-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Michelle Bray, Jr.; ranked 18th in Southern California girls' 
16 division, will play No. 1 singles; Amanda Hastings-Phillips, Jr., will play 
No. 2 singles and maybe some doubles; Lindsay Weiss, Jr., will play No. 2 or 
No. 3 singles; Sarah Cohen, Jr.; will play No. 1 doubles; Vanessa Zajfen, So.;

 Key newcomers: Stacey Kirner (), Sr., returns after missing last year; Kim 
Woodhouse, Fr., will play doubles; Summer Terry, Fr., will play doubles; Trini 
Jessoe, Fr. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Walton petitioned to move his two-time Southern Section Division II 
champions to Division I so they could battle Palos Verdes Peninsula. But when 
the Southern Section ruled that the entire Pacific Coast League would have to 
move up, Laguna Beach and the PCL decided to stay put. Too bad for Division II 
because the Artists are loaded again. "Now that we're still in Division II, the 
girls see the opportunity is there and the goal is there to win a third title," 
he said.

 Coach: Amy Beard (third year). 
</P>
<P>
 1993: 21-3, 14-0; lost to Laguna Beach, 11-7, in the Southern Section Division 
II finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Kelly Foster, Jr., will play No. 1 singles; Brooke Lacey, Sr., 
will play No. 2 singles; Tami Demaree, Jr., will play No. 1 doubles; Susie 
Krum, Sr., will probably play with Demaree. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Cynthia Torday, Jr., transfer from Northern California, will 
play doubles; Cerissa Drumm, Fr., will probably play doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Edison came within four points of winning the Division II title last 
year. The Chargers' chances of getting back to the finals diminished with the 
loss of sophomore Nicole Kojima, who is academically ineligible. "It's going to 
hurt us tremendously," Beard said. "You don't lose a player of that caliber." 
But Beard has four key players back and a couple of talented players coming in, 
so Edison should still have one of the county's top teams. "I'm hoping to win 
league," Beard said. "I feel we're going to be solid. Sometimes having depth is 
as important as having a real big highly ranked player."

<P>
 Coach: Charlie Bleiker (ninth year). 
</P>
<P>
 1993: 23-2, 14-0; lost to Palos Verdes Peninsula in Division I finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Emily Barker, So., will play singles and doubles; Katie 
Canright, So., will play doubles; Vanessa Godbey, So., ranked 51st in Southern 
California girls' 16s, will play singles and doubles; Sarah Hawkins, Sr., 
reached Southern Section doubles finals last year, will play No. 1 singles; 
Lindsay Olson, Sr., will play No. 2 singles and doubles; Jeremi Teal, Sr., was 
to play doubles but broke her collarbone playing soccer and will be out five to 
six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Ericka Nelson, Fr., will play singles and doubles; Brooke 
Taylor, Fr., will probably play doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Only Mara Colaizzi is gone from a team that dominated the Sea View 
League and Orange County. Had the Sailors not been played what amounted to a 
college team (Peninsula) in the finals, they would have won the section title. 
Without Colaizzi, Bleiker doesn't have the singles talent he did last year, but 
he has much more depth now that his freshman have a year's experience. Expect 
Newport Harbor to be the class of Orange County.

 Coach: Sue Gardiner (12th year) 
</P>
<P>
 1993: 12-5, 6-4 in the Century League; lost to Edison in second round of 
Division II playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Karen Chau, Sr., will play doubles; Faye DeVera, So., advanced 
to the round of 16 Southern Section singles and is ranked 13th in Southern 
California girls' 18s; Cari Ota, Sr., will play doubles; Jill Riley, Sr., will 
play No. 1 or No. 2 doubles; Susan Shaw, Jr., probably will play doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Katey Becker, Fr., ranked 52nd in Southern California girls' 14 
and will probably play No. 2 singles; Shawna Lerer, Fr., will play No. 3 
singles or doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Gardiner, the school's girls athletic director, returns to the court 
after a six-year absence, and her timing couldn't be better. The Spartans have 
the talent to challenge for the Division II title. "I always said the athletic 
director shouldn't coach, because it takes up too much time," she said. "But 
it's just too good of a team." The Spartans might have been better had senior 
Sarah Curry remained academically eligible. Curry would have played No. 2 
singles.

SPLASH STAYS AFLOAT WITH 8-5 VICTORY OVER SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Their backs to the wall and facing the indignity of being swept out of the 
playoffs by a team that finished five games back in the standings, the Splash 
answered its biggest challenge of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting five goals from defensive-oriented players, the Splash scored an 8-5 
victory over Sacramento Monday night in front of 7,439 at the Arco Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash will return to The Pond of Anaheim Wednesday for a third and final 
game of the first round of the Continental Indoor Soccer League series. Kickoff 
is 7:35 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash is 12-3 this season at The Pond, including a 10-4 loss in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second consecutive game, neither Dale Ervine (76 points) nor Raffaele 
Ruotolo (68 points) scored. The two are the team's top two goal-scorers and 
assist men, and they have yet to do either in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it shows we're not one-dimensional, we're two-dimensional," Splash 
Coach George Fernandez said. "They do things besides scoring. Obviously, 
without them scoring, we still won so they're doing something right. You can 
have no points and have a great game. You can score three goals and have a 
(bad) game. Both of them played damn good tonight and we played great as a 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dale and Raffe won't score in this series because of the style Sacramento 
plays; they get five guys behind the ball and crowd the box, so it's hard for 
them to get in a position to score." 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento got 14 blocks from its defense, and goalie Mike Dowler was again 
impressive. His 12 saves give him 27 in two games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash also hit the post or crossbar a half-dozen times. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding it easier to score than Ervine and Ruotolo were defenders Shane 
Hickson and Ralph Black -- who scored twice -- defender-turned-midfielder Doug 
Neely, who had a goal and two assists, and midfielder Jaime Francisco, who is 
playing because of his defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Two offensive threats, Rod Castro and Armando Valdivia, also scored. Castro 
tied the score, 4-4, in the third quarter, and Valdivia put the Splash ahead, 
6-4 and 8-5. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash scored twice in the final 3 1/2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a team, we played outstanding," Fernandez said. "We were disciplined, kept 
our focus, our concentration was excellent, we played like a team. Whenever 
anybody got beat, there was somebody right there to help. If we keep playing 
like this, we'll be very hard to beat; once we deviate from that, we get in 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was completely opposite of the other night. It was like night and day." 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights are not the kind of team that can come from behind, but the Splash 
had a tough time getting anything more than a two-goal lead. Although the 
Splash took a 3-2 lead at 14 minutes 15 seconds of the second quarter -- its 
first lead of the series -- the Splash gave it back by allowing a goal 54 
seconds into the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 After Roger Gibbins scored only his fourth goal of the season to give 
Sacramento a 4-3 lead, Castro, Francisco and Valdivia scored in a span of 3:14. 
</P>
<P>
 But another lapse allowed Sacramento to make it 6-5, when Jon Parry scored his 
third goal 27 seconds into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It kills me," Fernandez said of the quick goals. "The team that's going to 
win this series is the team that makes the least amount of mistakes. Most of 
their goals were mistakes and it just killed us. We were fortunate enough that 
they made more." 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Valenzuela had nine saves, including a couple of crucial efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash outshot Sacramento, 35-17 in the game, but had a tough time having 
anything to show for it early on. The Splash had an 18-8 edge in the first 
half, but had only a 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The power play again killed the Splash. Sacramento had the third-worst 
power-play percentage in the league (34.5%) during the regular season, but 
converted on its one opportunity in Game 2 after making three of four in Game 
1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash did not get a single power-play opportunity against the Knights, 
who allowed the third-most opportunities during the season.

MIGHTY DUCK NOTEBOOK / ROBYN NORWOOD; KARIYA READY FOR HIS DEBUT IN EXHIBITION 
AT DALLAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After eight days of drills and scrimmages, Paul Kariya makes his NHL debut 
tonight in an exhibition game against the Dallas Stars at Reunion Arena in 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time I'll play as a Duck, for the team itself and not against 
each other," said Kariya, who called camp "a learning experience." 
</P>
<P>
 "Like anything else, I'll go in with an open mind and give 100% effort. I 
don't have any expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya didn't even need a full shift to adjust to the level of play in team 
scrimmages last week, and Mighty Duck Coach Ron Wilson doesn't expect him to 
have too much difficulty tonight, although the competition will be a step up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll let him go out there, and you know how he makes adjustments," Wilson 
said. "We'll let him adjust to the speed and intensity level, which will 
certainly be different from our scrimmages. He's probably a little antsy after 
eight or nine days of practice without playing." 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya will play left wing on a line centered by Anatoli Semenov with fellow 
rookie Valeri Karpov, also making his first appearance, on the right. 
</P>
<P>
 The game also will mark the Duck debut of veteran defenseman Tom Kurvers, 
acquired from the New York Islanders for Troy Loney in June. Rookie Oleg 
Tverdovsky, the second overall pick at the June draft, will miss the two-game 
trip because of a sore groin, although he has resumed skating. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Little League culture has nothing on Canadian youth hockey culture, where 
pressure is intense and youngsters often leave home at 15 or 16 to play junior 
hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just shove it down. That's what Canadian juniors is all about, the NHL," 
said David McNab, the Ducks' director of player personnel. "All the publicity 
is about future NHLers and the draft." 
</P>
<P>
 As trying as it is, it's the route most Canadian players take to the NHL, 
which is why it's so striking to see Steve Rucchin making an impression in Duck 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
 He never played junior hockey and he was never drafted. The Ducks found the 
6-foot-3 center playing at the University of Western Ontario, where he was 
earning an honors degree in physiology. They picked him up in the supplemental 
draft in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody ever does this who plays just Canadian college," McNab said. "They 
always play Canadian juniors and then maybe go on to a Canadian college. For 
him to go this route, nobody goes this route. He told me that a couple of years 
ago, he never envisioned playing in the NHL at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Now he has survived the first cut and has an exhibition game goal under his 
belt, scored in the Ducks' 3-2 loss Sunday to the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an honor just to be here and a privilege. All you can do is give it your 
best," said Rucchin, 23. "I guess you'd say it's just a dream to play in an NHL 
exhibition game. It was even more exciting to be on the ice with the best 
player in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Rucchin isn't going to do any worse than play in San Diego this season, and 
he's going to get a good look from the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough to find a big centerman with offensive skill. That's really 
tough," McNab said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he didn't play junior hockey, he was underneath the radar of NHL 
teams. At 13 or 14, when the emphasis on being drafted by a junior team was 
heavy, Rucchin backed off. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate that at such a young age there's so much pressure," he said. 
"I got to a point where I was fed up and said, 'I don't want to do this.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets to a point where a lot of kids are playing all year, winter hockey, 
summer hockey. They push them way too hard. It's unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 A decade later, he's the fortunate one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Steve Rucchin probably even in a million years thought six 
months ago he'd be sitting here today with a shot at the NHL or playing pro 
hockey," McNab said. "Talk about a guy who could have slipped through the 
cracks." 
</P>
<P>
 Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas is 0-0-1 in exhibition play after a 5-5 tie Sunday with Calgary. Center 
Mike Modano and goaltender Andy Moog are expected to be in the Stars' lineup. . 
. . Duck forward Maxim Bets was scheduled to make the trip but is remaining 
behind because of a sore back. . . . The team trimmed 10 players from its 
roster Monday before departing for Dallas. Sent to the San Diego Gulls for the 
opening of minor league camp today were goaltenders Allan Bester, Sandy Allan 
and Byron Penstock, defensemen Mark DeSantis, Mark Yannetti and Darren Van Impe 
and forwards Mike Maneluk, Jeremy Stevenson, Kevin Sawyer and David Matsos. 
Defenseman Anatoli Fedotov, who had been AWOL from Ducks' camp but told the 
team he was confused about where he was to report, also will report to San 
Diego. The Ducks have 40 players remaining on their roster.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK / STEVE KRESAL: CLOSING MOMENTS OF OPENERS TURN UGLY 
FOR FULLERTON, OCC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The closing seconds of season-opening football games were unkind to two local 
teams Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton seemingly had earned an upset of Mt. San Antonio with a late 
touchdown, only to have the Mounties rally for a 39-39 tie. Mt. San Antonio 
started the season as the J.C. Grid-Wire's top-ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast trailed Pasadena, 24-0, at the half, came back to go ahead, 
25-24, only to lose, 27-25, on a field goal in the closing seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Fullerton game, Mt. San Antonio scored on a 22-yard touchdown pass with 
no time left, but the Hornets avoided the loss when Mt. San Antonio kicker 
Rodrigo Vera's point-after attempt was wide left. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very exciting game for people in the stands," Fullerton Coach Gene 
Murphy said. "But it wasn't very exciting to me . . . I saw on '20/20' the 
other night that ulcers aren't caused by stress. They're caused by bacteria. I 
feel a lot better knowing that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not very happy about the tie, but as we look at the tape you can see we 
did a lot of positive things. (Mt. San Antonio) was bigger, stronger and faster 
but our kids flew around and made some things happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton has a week off before a home game against El Camino on Sept. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish we had a bye after every game," Murphy said. "Saturday was maybe the 
fourth time we have been in full pads all season. We have plenty of skill 
people, but we just don't have the depth with the (linemen). We can't risk 
getting hurt in practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast doesn't have the luxury of an extra week to get ready. The 
Pirates travel to Cerritos Saturday for a 7 p.m. game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cross-country: The Orange Empire Conference, probably the best overall 
conference in the state, holds a preview run Saturday at Fairview Park in Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of four races begins at 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The run establishes the early-season favorites for the conference finals, Nov. 
5 at Fairview. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Valley is the defending conference and State champion. Orange Coast was 
second to Irvine Valley in the conference and State meets last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside won the men's conference title.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Water polo: Golden West, which has won the last five State titles under Coach 
Ken Hamdorf, is the top-ranked team in the community college water polo poll. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rustlers started the season by winning the Ventura tournament last 
Saturday. The Rustlers (5-0) beat Citrus, 8-7, in the title game. John Chomin 
led Golden West with 21 goals. He is a returning sophomore but not a member of 
a State tournament team. 
</P>
<P>
 Chomin, from Los Alamitos High School, played at Golden West in 1988 when the 
Rustlers lost in the championship game to Long Beach. He then spent time in the 
Navy before returning to college this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West will get a chance to prove its ranking this weekend when the 
Rustlers play in the Cuesta tournament. Including Golden West, seven of the top 
nine teams in the state are entered. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rustlers will be joined by No. 2 Long Beach, No. 3 Grossmont, No. 4 Orange 
Coast, No. 5 Cuesta, No. 7 West Valley and No. 8 Diablo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast, which figures to have a team strong enough to challenge Golden 
West, went 2-1 in the San Diego Mesa mini-tournament during the weekend. The 
Pirates' loss was to Grossmont, 17-8. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 George Sagen, the second-leading receiver in county history with 174 career 
receptions, is a reserve at Long Beach. Sagen helped Los Alamitos win Southern 
Section championships in 1991 and '92. He accepted a scholarship to Morehead 
State out of high school but left last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Sagen stood on the sideline watching his former Los Alamitos teammate, Don 
Ruberio of Golden West, catch an 18-yard touchdown pass in the third quarter of 
Long Beach's 35-14 victory Saturday. Sagen played sparingly in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brain Game: Sean Amos from Rancho Santiago and Lucy Jacobs from Saddleback 
were selected to the 1994 Wilson-California Scholar Athlete Honor Roll. 
</P>
<P>
 Amos, an All-Orange Empire Conference forward with the Dons last season, is 
attending California this fall but not playing basketball. Amos, from Foothill 
High, had a 3.64 grade-point average at Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs, an all-conference catcher, is a student at UC Irvine. Jacobs, from 
Capistrano Valley High, had a 3.76 GPA. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress won its first two women's soccer games last weekend to run its 
regular-season winning streak to 32. The Chargers are ranked third in the 
nation in College Sports magazine this fall. Cypress has 27 shutouts and has 
allowed five goals during that 32-game streak. . . Bakersfield (1-0) is the 
top-ranked football team in the weekly Southland poll. Palomar (1-0) is second, 
Long Beach (1-0) third, Riverside (1-0) fourth, El Camino (1-0) fifth, Mt. San 
Antonio (0-0-1) sixth, Pasadena (1-0) seventh, Chaffey (1-0) eighth, Los 
Angeles Valley (1-0) ninth and Cerritos (1-0) is 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (0-0-1), Saddleback (0-0) and Orange Coast (0-1) were among the 
others receiving votes.

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER; VOLLEYBALL COACH'S EXCITEMENT IS SHORT-LIVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not long ago, Mike Puritz was a happy man, brimming with optimism, 
effervescent as warm ginger ale. The UC Irvine women's volleyball coach was so 
excited to get the season started. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a season-opening victory over Southwest Missouri State, the 
Anteaters have lost their fizz. And they went completely flat Saturday night in 
the consolation rounds of the UC Santa Barbara Invitational, losing to Rhode 
Island after winning the first two games of the match. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine is 1-6 entering its Big West Conference opener Friday in Hawaii and 
Puritz's favorite brand of bubbly these days is Alka-Seltzer. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks ago, he began practice with just six returning players and six 
newcomers. Both setters were freshmen. Cause for concern? 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little nervous, but after the first week of practice I feel very 
confident," Puritz said two weeks ago. "This could be the best team ever. The 
Anteaters are going to surprise some people." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Irvine is off to its worst start and the Anteaters are surprising only 
Puritz. 
</P>
<P>
 "In retrospect, maybe my expectations weren't that realistic," Puritz said 
Monday, "but really, I still feel good about this team. I was making those 
judgments from the talent I saw in the gym. We have the talent, but we've 
lacked consistency, which I guess is a characteristic of a young team, and the 
teams we've played have been good enough to take advantage of that 
inconsistency."

 Puritz insists there have been positives. After juggling the lineup, he has 
settled on a starting team of one senior (outside hitter Stacy Mitchell), one 
junior (all-conference outside hitter Popi Edwards), one sophomore (opposite 
hitter Brandy Smerko) and three freshmen (setter Meredith Fletcher and middle 
blockers Amy Pimentel and Diana Juth). 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sorting it through my mind (Sunday), trying to understand what's 
happened and I realized that the last few years, we've had a veteran team," he 
said. "Well, the youth of this team is showing. We're not able to keep other 
teams' rolls to a minimum like we have in the past and we can't seem to 
maintain a high level of play." 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters had 41 receiving errors in the 16 games they played in Santa 
Barbara, and giving opponents almost three free points a game isn't the way to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have periods when we can't dig and we can't pass and that hurts," Puritz 
said. "But the chemistry seems to be there with the six I've decided on, so I 
actually feel fairly good right now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's just say the warning flags are ready, but I haven't raised them yet." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 How 'bout a luau? The Anteaters may have had a few bad days recently and 
they'll be working hard in Crawford Hall today. Thursday, they'll be gone to 
Maui. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year, the University of Hawaii takes a team to Maui for a conference 
game and the Anteaters were lucky enough to be invited this year. They'll play 
in Honolulu on Friday and in Maui on Saturday. They don't fly home until Sunday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather be playing at home and not have to miss the practice time," Puritz 
said. "My gut feeling is that we don't need any distractions right now, but who 
knows? Maybe we'll relax a little and stop fighting ourselves." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A running start: They don't get to run on any pristine island beaches, but the 
Irvine men's and women's cross-country teams have started down the path to a 
successful season. 
</P>
<P>
 The men finished second behind Fresno State in the season-opening Cal State 
Fullerton Invitational on Saturday, with junior transfer Bryan Contreras taking 
eighth overall. He covered the hot and dusty 8,000-meter course at Carbon 
Canyon Regional Park in 25 minutes 9 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The women, who finished third behind Fresno and the Asics Track West club 
team, were led by sophomore Laura Monson (18:29 on the 5,000-meter course), who 
also was eighth overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine will play host to the UCI Invitational Saturday at Fairview Park in 
Costa Mesa. The Arkansas women's team, the NCAA runner-up last season, will be 
participating. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Tracie Manz, who scored the game-winner during Sunday's 1-0 overtime 
women's soccer victory at University of the Pacific, and senior Kim Frazen are 
tied for 11th in the NCAA Western Region rankings with two goals and two 
assists for six points. Sophomore goalkeeper Stephanie Boes is fifth in 
goals-against average (0.6). Boes had to make only one save against Pacific to 
record her sixth career shutout. . . . Marine Cano, director of soccer/women's 
coach, will see a lot of familiar faces Saturday when the Anteaters play host 
to Cal State Dominguez Hills. Cano coached the Toros for 10 years -- including 
1991 when they won the NCAA Division II championship -- before coming to Irvine 
last winter.

FIXATIONS: A PAIR OF ARTISTS IMMERSE THEMSELVES IN THE CLASSICS; ANAHEIM AUTO 
RESTORERS ALEX DE ULLOA AND TIM KREHBIEL TAKE THEIR TIME BRINGING CARS BACK TO 
PRODUCTION-LINE -- OR BETTER -- CONDITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By the time Henry Ford was producing his Model A cars in 1927 in his new 
state-of-the-art River Rouge, Mich., plant, he had the concept of the assembly 
line so perfected that raw iron ore entering the plant exited it a mere 28 
hours later as a completed automobile. A new car left the line every 24 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 But, despite the haste in which they were made, the cars have certainly hung 
aroundand gone through some odd permutations in the process.  
</P>
<P>
 Ford's autos ran like a happy dog and were cheap and plentiful, made to be the 
conveyance for everyman. Like most things mass-produced, they weren't designed 
with eternity in mind. But a curious thing happened on the way to the junk 
heap. By the time everyman's son was hitting his teens in the '50s, adolescence 
had become a powerful social entity, with youths asserting their newfound 
status with their own dress, heroes, culture and cars. 
</P>
<P>
 So 30 years on, Model A's were picked up for a song and transformed into 
hot-rods, with souped-up engines and wild paint jobs. Lumbering lumber-made 
woody station wagons became the surfers' choice for tooling along Pacific Coast 
Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, another three decades along, many of the cars are still around, the 
pampered property of those with the wherewithal to indulge a nostalgia for the 
simpler times of their youth. That pampering doesn't come cheap: The cost of 
restoring a classic car can approach the sort of dollar figures one associates 
with a long hospital stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing the completed work of Alex de Ulloa and Tim Krehbiel, one can 
understand why classic-car owners are willing to shell out anywhere from 
$10,000 to $70,000 to have their vehicles restored. The Fords, Mercurys and 
other models housed at the pair's Arrowsmith Automotive couldn't have looked 
better on the showroom floor back when Calvin Coolidge was in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is surely nothing today to match them. Sit in a '38 Merc woody and 
you feel you're not so much in a car as in a stateroom on an ocean liner, 
surrounded by the smooth warmth of varnished maple and mahogany curving around 
you. And it's hard to not feel like a spunky youth just looking at the bright 
yellow Model A roadster they're restoring, with candy-apple red wheels and 
deluxe pin-striping. 
</P>
<P>
 Krehbiel and de Ulloa say they'll often spend hours researching the just-so 
particulars of the thousands of parts that are out of view. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard for me to consider myself a mechanic," said Krehbiel, 34. "I'd 
consider myself an artist first." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we bring an art to the cars," agreed de Ulloa, 54. "Even though we 
bring them back to the way there were done on the production line, we do it in 
a beautiful way. And sometimes we bring it back better than the production line 
ever did." 
</P>
<P>
 Spend any time with the pair and these don't seem like boasts, rather just a 
simple pride in their painstaking work. While it may have taken Ford 28 hours 
to build a car, it can sometimes take the two a year or more to restore one. 
Even with the prices they charge, they say their business -- opened by charging 
their credit cards to the max -- has yet to turn the corner on profitability. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Their claims to being artists have some background. Before opening Arrowsmith 
Automotive 18 months ago, de Ulloa was a graphic artist and Krehbiel a sculptor 
and architect (last year the Orange County chapter of the American Institute of 
Architects gave him an award for his design of the Laguna Beach studio/living 
space in which he resides). 
</P>
<P>
 De Ulloa knew Krehbiel through the latter's father, another lifelong car 
fanatic, and when their artistic pursuits hit the skids in the recent economy, 
they decided to pool their abilities and try something else they loved.  
</P>
<P>
 Both had previously restored vintage cars as a hobby and sideline. Krehbiel 
likes to display a 1963 black and white photo of him at age 3 helping his dad 
repair a '39 Ford. Suspended on chains from the ceiling in one corner of the 
shop is the husk of an '32 Model A roadster De Ulloa has had for decades. If 
there's ever a break in their schedule he dreams of getting it running again. 
In its present sorry disassemblage it looks like a tin bathtub on a sled. 
</P>
<P>
 He's owned other vintage autos, but had to sell them. Krehbiel contents 
himself with borrowing his father's cars, recently taking friends up the coast 
to San Simeon in a Ford woody. 
</P>
<P>
 Though their everyday vehicles are a more recent Ford van and pickup, the two 
claim they're not solely stuck on that one make. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've restored Fords that have been in car shows, so people bring us more of 
them," De Ulloa said. "And in the whole field of collecting cars, Fords must 
make up about 80% of it. When I was a kid, a Ford was the only thing to have 
because they were durable and you could flog them and they'd still work.  
</P>
<P>
 "The hot-rodders used Fords all the time because they were the fastest things 
around. And the wrecking yard people would crush the other makes for the iron, 
but they wouldn't crush Fords because they knew they had this pipeline of kids 
who wanted the parts. So there's more Fords still around today because of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with dealing with the engines and suspensions, they think the car is a 
good make from which to learn about owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Krehbiel said: "Ford is a good place for us to start in this business, because 
their drivers run the full gamut. You have the daily-driver guys who just want 
it to start up and go, then the car show fanatics where every nut and bolt has 
to be perfect, and the street rod guys who just want to go fast. We figure if 
you can do a good job working for all that, you can satisfy any client." 
</P>
<P>
 One client is also the owner of their business's building. Half the building 
is used to store his cars, a remarkable collection of old Fords and Mercurys, 
most of which the two have restored. Cars currently under restoration in the 
shop range from the flashy hod-rodded yellow roadster -- the property of a 
retired gentleman who likes to tool around Leisure World in it -- to a stately, 
shapely '39 K Model Lincoln, an extravagant monster with a V-12 engine. Even in 
the Depression it sold for $11,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One project De Ulloa has been working on since even before the shop opened is 
a frame-off restoration of a 1940 Ford Deluxe woody. Its owner, Norris Pratt, 
was in the shop that day, as he has often been, watching and photographing its 
slow rebirth. He'd originally brought the car in to have a balky water pump 
fixed and ended up deciding to have it entirely rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt, a 54-year-old executive, has owned and sold a number of vintage cars 
but says this one is the keeper. He's always had a soft spot for the wagons, he 
said, since he was a lifeguard decades ago in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of De Ulloa and Krehbiel's work has been with woody station wagons. The 
reason the wagons had passenger compartments made of wood is tied in with the 
reason they were called station wagons, De Ulloa said.  
</P>
<P>
 "They were originally made for railroad stations, to carry people and luggage 
around. Ford was the first company to make a wagon for them in the 1920s. Since 
the production numbers were so low, they decided to make them out of wood" 
rather than tool up to make them out of metal. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time station wagons were being made for public consumption, the wood 
bodies had become a tradition. Since Henry Ford owned his own forests, timber 
mills and wood shops, there was no problem obliging. Other car makers followed 
suit.  
</P>
<P>
 The last woodies in the early '50s were made with a wood veneer on a steel 
body, not unlike some modern vans that feature cosmetic panels of artificial 
wood, which De Ulloa disparagingly refers to as "shelf paper." Earlier woodies 
lived up to their name, though, with heavy passenger compartments formed solely 
of wood.  
</P>
<P>
 While uniquely beautiful, that construction wasn't without its drawbacks. 
"I've read some accounts of accidents with these," De Ulloa said, "and they had 
a big problem with splinters." It wasn't unknown for the cars to get termites, 
and there were more common enemies such as dry rot.  
</P>
<P>
 De Ulloa said it is the condition of the wood that determines the value of a 
woody now, with prices for prime wagons reaching up to $80,000. From 1946 to 
1948 Ford also made a woody convertible called the Sportsman that goes for 
upward of $100,000 today. The two recently restored a woody that had belonged 
to the actress Gloria Swanson. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with all the mechanical work, restoring such cars involves a multistaged 
process of stripping, bleaching and staining the wood -- replacing irreparable 
parts with closely matched woods -- and going through a 10-stage varnish and 
sanding finish.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When they aren't varnishing, the two are often waxing philosophical. Some days 
they discuss the future of the car restoration business and doubt it will 
continue much past their lifetimes, if that. 
</P>
<P>
 Krehbiel said: "Sociologically, we're on the twilight of the combustion engine 
for private transportation. And as soon as they're not used anymore, the 
romance about them will change. If no one is dealing with combustion engines in 
40 years, are they going to be interested in 1992 Nissans? I kind of doubt it." 
</P>
<P>
 De Ulloa said: "And I don't think people in the future will get as excited 
about today's cars. And restoring them? There's so much plastic and on-board 
computers that change every year, I doubt if anybody's going to be able or 
willing to deal with it all." 
</P>
<P>
 While both claim to like the handling and comfort of modern cars, they also 
see parallels between those vehicles and the isolation of modern communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I happen to think new cars are great," Krehbiel said. "As an architect, I 
wish we could make buildings as good as we make new cars. But the neat thing 
about these old cars is they still give you a sense of being in the world when 
you're driving them. You have to shift the gears, pull the choke. You roll the 
window down and open the vent, with your arm out the window, and it's 
comfortable . It gives you more a sense of where you are. We're weird. Even in 
new cars we roll the windows down instead of using the air conditioner to get a 
bit of that feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 De Ulloa said: "You're more of a participant in these. I'm amazed by the way 
new cars ride, but I really like to be a participant, with the noises, the 
bumps and the smells and everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "They cared more about the individual when they made these. They throw the 
term 'ergonomic' around so much now, taking about the placement of the gear 
shift and everything. But you know what? The damn car, you can't fit in it, 
it's such a cubicle." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They listen to Robert Johnson's blues, big band music and KROQ while they 
work, and "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance" shares shelf space with 
their shop manuals.  
</P>
<P>
 They didn't name their business after the rock band, but, rather, after 
Sinclair Lewis' 1925 novel "Arrowsmith" about an idealistic doctor dedicated to 
the scientific process. Krehbiel said he feels a kinship with the protagonist. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a guy who is really impassioned by the empirical method. . . . With 
these cars I'm very interested in their construction aesthetic, but I don't 
have nostalgic connotations about the cars. I'm more interested in how they 
were made than in what they are." 
</P>
<P>
 He might be willing to make exceptions to empiricism, if the right E Type 
Jaguar came his way, while De Ulloa makes no bones about his affection for his 
denuded roadster hanging from the ceiling. He also says that, no matter how 
objective they try to be, they usually wind up falling in love with the cars 
they're working on. 
</P>
<P>
 Krehbiel said, "These come from such a simpler, easier time, and people all 
want to be reminded of that." 
</P>
<P>
 "The nostalgia for me is really big," De Ulloa said. "People my age recall 
this simpler lifestyle. We were worried about the nuclear bomb the Russians 
had, but daily life was a piece of cake by comparison. The bomb was just a 
distant worry. You didn't worry about it taking you out when you were just 
standing at a burger stand.  
</P>
<P>
 "So many of us are searching for our lost youth, and Southern California is 
such a car culture that our identification with them is probably stronger than 
with our houses. Even doing this as a business, we usually fall in love with 
the cars we're working on and wish we could somehow own one of those and one of 
these and one of these. It's under control, but we do like the cars a lot."

FIRST PERSON: BODY WATCH; NO LONGER HANGING HIS HEAD IN SHAME; "A STUDY

<P>
 At last! A medical study I don't find scary! 
</P>
<P>
 Lately all I've heard is that it's unhealthy for me to eat popcorn or Chinese 
food or hot dogs -- by sad coincidence my three favorite foods in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the scientists say I'm actually lucky to be lugging around a Size 8 
noggin. 
</P>
<P>
 What a turnabout after all the years of uneasiness I felt as a juvenile. It's 
enough to make me shake my head -- a somewhat cumbersome process, I admit. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, sure, my top-heaviness may not be apparent to the naked eye. But, I grew 
up in the era when hats were sold by size. Self-conscious kid that I was, I 
felt acute embarrassment when wide-eyed clerks had to bring me adult sizes in 
baseball head wear. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the danger of a schoolboy enemy ripping off my chapeau and 
shouting to the world the shocking statistic. 
</P>
<P>
 So I took to buying undersized hats. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if I'd known about denial back then, I wouldn't have cared that it sat so 
precariously on my head. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, playing right field on my Little League team could be a 
terrifying experience on a windy day. I might be absent from my station for 
long periods, during which I would be chasing my hat as it danced about on the 
grass. Fortunately, not many balls came to right field, which was the reason I 
was assigned to that remote region in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 My only consolation was that another ballplayer, Willie Mays, was celebrated 
by the sports writers for constantly losing his cap. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s, my parents detested Alabama Gov. George Wallace, but I had an 
additional reason for sympathizing with the public figures whom Wallace branded 
as "pointy-headed intellectuals." No size 8s there, I figured. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, when I started basic training as a National Guard enlistee, a supply 
sergeant said to me: "How come that hat doesn't fit you, boy? It's the biggest 
one we got. What's wrong with you? You got an e-lawn-gated head or something?" 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, circumference was the problem, but I didn't correct him. He no doubt 
considered it the latest ploy of that Vietnam era to secure a discharge from 
the armed forces, like a friend of mine who smoked cigarettes and drank coffee 
for 12 consecutive hours before his (failed) induction. 
</P>
<P>
 By my mid-20s or thereabouts, the era of adjustable-size caps dawned, along 
with the slogan: 
</P>
<P>
 "One size fits all." 
</P>
<P>
 My foot. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point I was beginning to lose my hair, making it imperative to find 
head covering from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in my 40s, I've noticed my belly is getting bigger, a not-so-healthy 
sign, according to other scientific studies. So I've resumed swimming. The 
other day, I went to a sporting goods store and found that there was only one 
model of men's swim caps available. 
</P>
<P>
 "One size fits all," the clerk explained, as though to a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Donning it in my YMCA pool an hour later, I thought my eyes would pop out. 
</P>
<P>
 So, I went back to the store and told the clerk I had to buy a swimming cap 
for my wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's got a big hairdo," I added. 
</P>
<P>
 He nodded, although I could swear he briefly took in the contours of my skull 
before going back to the stockroom. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned with a truly cavernous model. It was pink and covered with 
yellow-and-blue lily pads. 
</P>
<P>
 "Great," I said and bought it. 
</P>
<P>
 No use being small-minded.

R S V P / INTO THE NIGHT: READING AND REMEMBERING GILDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK EHRMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Scene: L.A.'s glitterary elite turned out en masse at the Westwood 
Playhouse on Thursday for the staged reading-cum-publication party for "Bunny 
Bunny," writer Alan Zweibel's memories of his 14-year friendship with the late 
comedian and original "Saturday Night Live" star Gilda Radner, who died of 
ovarian cancer five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a necessary kind of therapy for me," Zweibel, one of the original SNL 
writers and a four-time Emmy winner, told the audience. "I wrote in dialogue 
because it's more intimate that way, plus I'm not that good at grammar and 
punctuation." 
</P>
<P>
 The staged reading of "Bunny Bunny" featured "Seinfeld" co-stars Jason 
Alexander and Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Zweibel and Radner.  
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: The performance drew more than 400 people, with no shortage of 
industry heavies. In addition to Zweibel and the cast and hosts James L. 
Brooks, Bernie Brillstein and People Weekly President Ann Moore, the event drew 
Carl and Rob Reiner, SNL alumni Laraine Newman, Garrett Morris, Jon Lovitz, 
Billy Crystal and Mary Gross plus Garry Shandling, Teri Garr, Steve Guttenberg 
and erstwhile mega-gold-medalist Mark Spitz. 
</P>
<P>
 What They Wore: Despite the "casual dress" code, the turnout was heavy on 
suits and power ties for men and evening dresses for the ladies. 
</P>
<P>
 Chow: Following the reading, guests feasted on a prime rib, grilled swordfish, 
jicama salad and other haute cuisine goodies, and a dessert tray laden with 
fresh fruit and such baked treats as chocolate-bunny-topped caramel praline 
cakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Overheard: "What? You actually own ICM?" one schmoozer was heard to exclaim. 
"My god, you're a real player. What's your name?" 
</P>
<P>
 Tip for Strasberg Graduates: "I didn't go about playing Gilda Radner," said 
Louis-Dreyfus. "I went about playing this person named Gilda. I approached it 
like one would approach any character in a play. I don't think if it as doing 
her even though we all know it's her. I think of it as doing a piece of 
theater." 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "I loved Gilda Radner and I knew her very well," said 
actor-writer-comedian Carl Reiner, after the performance. "When she left five 
years ago, it was much too soon. And we miss her. And she was brought back to 
life again in a most marvelous way by two actors who understood her and Alan 
Zweibel who wrote this as a tribute to her. It was a totally honest piece of 
work."  
</P>
<P>
 Money Matters: In total, $52,000 was raised for Gilda's Club -- a group of 
nonprofit, non-residential centers (scheduled to begin opening in cities 
nationwide next winter) that will provide psychological and social support 
communities for cancer patients and their families. All proceeds from sales of 
the book will go to Gilda's Club as well.

 With French food and wine served at a picturesque Italian villa, a benefit for 
the Pacific Chorale on Sunday made guests feel as if they were in another 
country -- even if they weren't sure which one. 
</P>
<P>
 The Premiere Chapter of the Pacific Chorale Guild called its soiree "An 
Afternoon in Provence," yet nobody minded that the location -- the estate of 
David and Darrellyn Melilli -- was an Italian villa perched atop a canyon in 
Laguna Niguel. About 120 guests attended the $65-per-person gala, which was 
expected to net $12,000 for the chorale. A Meeting of Cultures 
</P>
<P>
 Guests were greeted inside the polished marble interior of the Melilli 
residence, then fanned out to admire the home's classic arches and columns and 
back-yard view of the surrounding canyons and ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to make this (home) as pure Italian as we could. My husband is 
Italian, and we travel to Italy often. We enjoy the culture," said Darrellyn 
Melilli, a former chorale member who wore a colorful silk dress from Paris in 
honor of the Provence theme. 
</P>
<P>
 Three buffets laden with French specialties prepared by chef Pascal Olhats 
were all that was needed to make guests feel they were dining in the French 
countryside. At one table they sampled roasted salmon and seared ahi, while 
another buffet offered roasted loin of lamb and potato gratin. Upstairs, on the 
balcony, yet a third buffet was stocked with onion tart, chicken brochette with 
pesto. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Pacific Chorale performed choral favorites for the crowd, many 
of whom are past and present chorus members. Singing His Praises 
</P>
<P>
 The gala was held in honor of John Alexander -- artistic director and 
conductor of the chorale for 23 years -- who has helped the group gain 
international prominence. 
</P>
<P>
 "John's very charismatic. Our singers love him," said Betsy Moulton, president 
of the Pacific Chorale Guild. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Alexander also had glowing words for his singers: 
</P>
<P>
 "They're so committed to the concept of excellence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Morris, event co-chairwoman, began singing with the chorale in 1968 -- 
just one year after it started. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started with 40 members. Today they have almost 200 members and they 
perform with world-famous orchestras," Morris said. "It's very different from 
the days when we sang with just a piano or organ." 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Landstrom, the other co-chairwoman who also joined the chorale in its 
early days, recalled that the original members did everything from passing out 
programs to helping to carry the risers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was bare-bones compared to today," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the gala will help underwrite a Feb. 26 concert at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center featuring the Pacific Chorale, Pacific Symphony 
and Ballet Pacifica. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those attending were Doreen Marshall, honorary chairwoman; Greg 
Silberman, executive director of the chorale, and his wife Liliana; Bob and 
Donna Morse, Mark and Shari Cole, Lynn and Sally Rans, Terry and Phyllis Clark, 
Jack and Jan Eversmeyer, Harvey and Sharon Fair, Diane Olson, Betty 
Belden-Palmer, Marilyn Gerdts, Richard and Barbara Riffel, Vesta Curry, Bob and 
Randi Larsen and Rita Major. A Sorority of Survivors 
</P>
<P>
 Women who have waged -- and won -- the battle against breast cancer shared 
their stories of survival at a high tea to kick off the upcoming Race for the 
Cure benefit presented by the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 About 250 women, many of them breast cancer survivors, attended the tea Sunday 
at the Newport Beach Marriott. The tea was held to promote the race, a 5K and 
one-mile run/walk at Newport Center in Newport Beach on Sept. 25, which will 
raise money for the education, research, screening and treatment of breast 
cancer. A Name and a Number 
</P>
<P>
 Cancer survivors wore name tags with a number signifying the years since they 
overcame the disease. Numbers ranging from one to 37 (sported by Agnes Gardner) 
were spotted on tags. For guests, just being around other women who have 
survived breast cancer was reason for optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is where (survivors) can meet other women who have turned the breast 
cancer experience into something positive. That's why we called this tea 
'Making Miracles,' " said Nancy Raymon, event co-chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Corinne Beacham-Greene, the other co-chairwoman, wore the number 5 on her name 
tag. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was diagnosed, the thing that gave me the most hope was knowing that 
people do survive," she said. "But we do lose a lot of women to breast cancer. 
We have a long race ahead." Stories of Survival 
</P>
<P>
 Dava Gerard founded the foundation's Orange County chapter because, as a 
breast surgeon, she realized many of her patients support needs weren't being 
met. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of issues outside of the operating room that needed to be 
addressed," she said. "Every woman here has an incredible story to tell." 
</P>
<P>
 One of those women was Patty Ecker, a former CBS-TV newscaster whose cancer 
was diagnosed in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all belong to the same sorority, yet none of us would wish membership on 
anyone else," Ecker said. "Cancer robbed me terribly." Yet it also helped her 
re-examine her priorities. After battling the disease, she decided to quit CBS 
to spend more time with her children. 
</P>
<P>
 "A life-and-death disease opens a new perspective inward," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others attending were Sheila Hillinger, who wrote a song to be sung at the 
race by breast cancer survivors; Wendy Schain, a psychologist and 25-year 
breast cancer survivor who has done research on breast cancer patients; Brenda 
Friday, Sandi Carter, Barbara Garcia, Lynn Kelsey, P.J. Viviansayles, Jeannette 
Gardner, Wanda Cobb, Theresa Griffith, Robyn Holtz, Roberta Sweeney, Joan 
Lieux, Judy Parker, Rita Lambert, Sue Winn, Sandy Finestone, Jan Thielbar and 
Jane Hill. KATHRYN BOLD

PLAYERS WANT A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS; OXNARD: BOYS & GIRLS CLUB MEMBERS HAVE 
BEEN PUT OUT BY STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS AFFLICTING THE GYM'S CEILING. BUT PORT 
HUENEME SEABEES VOLUNTEERED FOR REPAIR DUTY.

<P>
 Basketball players often dream of sinking the game-winning jump shot and 
watching the roof cave in under a cascade of cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 500 children who play hoops at the Oxnard Boys & Girls Club are 
unlikely to fantasize about that. They want a sturdy ceiling to play their 
games under. 
</P>
<P>
 The club's gym has been closed since June 1 -- the start of the summer 
basketball league -- after an insurance inspector discovered that the 
33-year-old building had unstable walls and a slouching roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Support beams had to be installed in the middle of the court to hold the 
ceiling up. Damage was estimated at $80,000, and the club's board of directors 
worried about the future of the site. 
</P>
<P>
 But after some prodding by Oxnard Councilman Tom Holden, a board member, some 
Seabees from the Port Hueneme Naval Construction Battalion Center have 
volunteered to fix the gym in their off-hours -- if someone buys the $30,000 
worth of materials needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of us have desk jobs, so it's good to get out and lay some blocks," said 
Master Chief William Jones, who is in charge of the project. "There's nothing 
really technical about this. It's straightforward work." 
</P>
<P>
 To raise money for the project, the Boys & Girls Club has scheduled its first 
annual "Kids Are Our Racquet" tennis tournament Saturday at the Cabrillo 
Racquet Club. Organizers hope to raise $12,000 through the doubles tournament, 
then seek funding from other organizations to cover the remaining costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Club workers are aiming to open the gym in October. The Boys & Girls Club 
plans to honor the Seabees with a barbecue once the work is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Abe Oliveras, executive director of the Boys & Girls Club, said the kids -- 
many of whom shot baskets in the gym every day -- were upset about the gym's 
closure. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were all bummed out," Oliveras said. "For a lot of them, it's a home 
away from home. But we said, 'Hey, you wouldn't want the roof to cave in on 
your head.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The summer league's 40 teams were able to salvage their tattered seasons, 
playing a confusing schedule at Oxnard High School, the Colonia Gym and the 
Port Hueneme Boys & Girls Club. 
</P>
<P>
 But the other facilities charged the Boys & Girls Club to use their gyms, and 
club workers, short of money, do not know if their popular winter basketball 
league will ever tip off this November. 
</P>
<P>
 Alongside the condemned gym, the kids shuffled around on a makeshift court set 
up on asphalt, trying to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't need any practice," said 15-year-old Anita Lemos, who plays on one 
team and coaches another. She lofted an air ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan McKesson's game was in better shape, as he dribbled around the court 
like a 10-year-old John Starks. 
</P>
<P>
 A guard on the league's Knicks team, Jonathan said his fans now have nowhere 
to sit to watch him practice. He also complained about the officiating at Port 
Hueneme, which he considers awful. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom and dad want to come, but they've got nowhere to sit," Jonathan said. 
"I'm hoping we can get in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon Franklin's girth makes him the Knicks' ace in the post. Sweating on 
the sidelines after a three-on-three match, he reminisced of cooler days in the 
air-conditioned gym. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hotter out here," Shannon said. "Way hotter."

PLAN TO BUY PROPERTY AT AIRPORT CONSIDERED; COUNTY: THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS 
WILL REVIEW TODAY A PROPOSAL TO PURCHASE FIVE ACRES IN THE HOPE OF SETTLING A 
DISPUTE OVER POLLUTED LAND. 
</P>

<P>
 Seeking to settle a messy lawsuit over underground fuel contamination, the 
Ventura County Board of Supervisors today will consider purchasing five acres 
of land at the Oxnard Airport for $2.15 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard Aero Center, which owns the property, had charged that fuel tanks 
at a nearby county-owned parcel leaked and polluted their land. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was apparently some contamination that had seeped from a couple of 
storage tanks onto this property," said Ventura County Airports Administrator 
Rod Murphy. "It's no longer a problem, but apparently the company wasn't 
satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
 After a year of negotiations, the Board of Supervisors agreed to purchase the 
land last month as part of a settlement agreement with the Oxnard Aero Center 
and several other firms regarding water and land pollution at the airport. The 
board will consider approving the deal today after a public hearing on the 
issue. A four-fifths vote is required. 
</P>
<P>
 A crop-dusting and jet-fuel company, Condor Helicopters, leased the county 
parcel from 1966 to 1986, when the spill was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the same time, Condor Helicopters was bought out by Evergreen 
Helicopters of Alaska, which refused to assume the cleanup costs for the fuel 
spill and an unrelated pesticide contamination. Their refusal led to a flurry 
of lawsuits involving the county and other firms at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has always been a question of (Evergreen) taking over the assets without 
taking over the liability," said Assistant County Counsel Don Hurley. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the county expects to make about $125,000 from the remediation, 
and will acquire a property it wanted anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking to expand its airport facilities, the county had applied to the 
Federal Aviation Administration for a grant to purchase part of the polluted 
land before the settlement, and it decided to ask the FAA for $1.93 million to 
buy it all, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's some property we were looking at anyway for storage and rental space and 
future aviation needs," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials expect the FAA to reimburse 90% of the county's purchasing 
price, and Evergreen Helicopter and other firms that allegedly polluted the 
land will pay the county more than the remaining 10% as part of the settlement 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The extra money will be used to help pay for cleanup costs, expected to run 
about $250,000, Hurley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The seeping fuel tanks were removed in the early 1990s, and environmental 
tests have shown that contamination on the Oxnard Aero Center property is 
minimal, Hurley said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was certainly a probability that it would eventually be contaminated," 
Hurley said. "(But) the latest tests seem to indicate that it is not a 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 But Robert L. McCord, the Ventura attorney representing the Oxnard Aero 
Center, said the pollution prevented his client from selling the property or 
developing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that the property was worthless," McCord said. "No lender 
with a 10-foot pole would touch a contaminated property." 
</P>
<P>
 The county will probably deal with many more remediation lawsuits in the 
coming years due to a lack of environmental planning, Hurley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Underground storage tanks do have a limited life span," Hurley said. "This 
kind of thing is happening everywhere, and we expect to see more of this."

MAN SENTENCED TO 2 YEARS IN FRAUD SCHEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal court judge on Monday sentenced the finance director of a defunct 
Oxnard defense contractor to two years in prison for cheating the government 
out of $3.3 million by submitting claims for work that was never done. 
</P>
<P>
 District Court Judge J. Spencer Letts in Los Angeles also fined Del 
Manufacturing executive Richard Ceniseroz $50,000 and ordered him to pay $2.8 
million in restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 The 42-year-old Oxnard man had pleaded guilty to theft of government property 
and filing false claims. Two other company officials from the same family were 
sentenced to non-prison confinement and fined. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Delgado, 40, of Ojai was placed in a halfway house for six months, given 
three years probation and fined $10,000 for obstruction of a federal audit. 
Teresa Delgado, 65, was sentenced to six months home confinement, three years 
probation and fined $10,000 for perjury. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Janet Levine said the family was prepared for Monday's 
sentencing, but was still shocked by the penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all very close, and this has been a tragedy for the family," Levine 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Atty. Charles Kreindler said Del officials defrauded the government by 
filing claims for $3.3 million but failed to deliver most of the lug nuts they 
promised to manufacture at their small Richmond Avenue plant in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although Del had claimed to incur almost the entire amount awarded under the 
contract, it had only shipped 28.1% of the lug nut forgings to the government," 
Kreindler said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said that the Delgados then attempted to falsify records to 
hide the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceniseroz was also convicted of not returning $800,000 that was mistakenly 
paid to Del for the manufacture of Army practice bombs. Del received two 
identical $800,000 checks in settling a dispute over that contract, but 
deserved just one. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of returning the second check, the company spent the money to cover 
debts of another Del division that made aluminum wheels, according to 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even in the case of the second check," defense lawyer Levine said, "they used 
it to try and bail out another part of their business. They didn't buy luxury 
items for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The Del investigation began in summer 1992, when Army and Navy investigators 
and FBI agents raided the Oxnard plant, seizing company files and documents. A 
federal grand jury indicted the company, Ceniseroz and the Delgados later that 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors eventually dropped fraud charges against the company because it 
was insolvent.

JUDGE DISMISSES CHARGES IN BRAWL SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY and JULIE FIELDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Ruling that police illegally obtained a confession, a Ventura County judge has 
dismissed charges against the main defendant in a shooting that left two 
Westlake High School football players hospitalized last February. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath was a stinging defeat 
for prosecutors in one of the most high-profile incidents of gang-related 
violence in Thousand Oaks in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys said Monday that McGrath's decision should send a strong 
message to law officers that coercive interrogations will not be tolerated in 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was a correct ruling, and a lot of time we don't see the police 
getting the word back that what they did was improper," said Deputy Public 
Defender Donna L. Forry, who represents the 16-year-old defendant, Oubansack 
(Andy) Sonethanouphet. 
</P>
<P>
 But the father of 17-year-old David Behling, one of the victims, said the 
judge and the legal system have let his son down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a pretty sad day when the courts in Ventura County are more 
concerned with defendants' rights than the safety of our citizens," said Dick 
Behling, whose son was shot in the back of the head.  
</P>
<P>
 "We had a confession to shooting two human beings, and the judge says that the 
school policeman spoke to him too sternly, and he's free to go," said Behling, 
whose son still suffers from headaches but has rejoined the football team. "It 
doesn't make sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they will decide in a week or two whether to recharge 
Sonethanouphet with the two counts of assault with a firearm. They also 
defended the two Ventura County sheriff's deputies in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies Randy Pentis and Jeffrey Allaire of the East Valley sheriff's station 
conducted the interview on Feb. 9 with Sonethanouphet at Rowland High School in 
Rowland Heights, where Sonethanouphet was a student. Prosecutors said school 
police officer Davis Estrada, who sat in on the interview, tried to intimidate 
the suspect during the interview, apparently oblivious to the fact that a tape 
was running. 
</P>
<P>
 "This other guy, the (school) officer, he didn't know the tape was on," Deputy 
Dist. Atty. John Vanarelli said. "That's why he said all those horrible 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County deputies did not say anything that was out of line, 
Vanarelli contended. "In fact, they tried to clean it up as best they could." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Estrada nor his supervisors returned calls seeking comment on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath's decision is not the first blow to the prosecutor's case. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, James Lee, a co-defendant and the alleged mastermind of a melee that 
led to the shooting, fled prosecution. The 16-year-old Lee and his older 
brother Frank, 21, are believed to have left the country for Taiwan, their 
homeland. Frank Lee is also a suspect in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Only two defendants whose whereabouts are known remain in the case: William 
Huang of Brea in Orange County and John Yi of Thousand Oaks, both 17. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred on Feb. 4 after James Lee and Westlake High football 
player Curtis Simmons agreed to engage in a fistfight at North Ranch Park to 
settle a dispute. Simmons showed up at the park with a large group of friends, 
including numerous football teammates, while Lee came with five carloads of 
supporters armed with baseball bats and guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Five days after the shooting, Pentis and Allaire interviewed Sonethanouphet at 
Rowland High. McGrath ruled that Sonethanouphet was never read his Miranda 
rights advising him against self-incriminating statements and was also 
subjected to threatening statements. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a transcript of the taped interview, school officer Estrada told 
Sonethanouphet to tell the Ventura County deputies what they wanted to know 
because "I've seen these guys. They get upset." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Allaire told the defendant: "Andy, I need to talk to my partner because 
he is going to lose it in a minute." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After the two deputies had apparently left the room, Estrada said: "I've seen 
(Pentis) lose it, Andy. And ah, it's just me and you in here. And I don't see 
(expletive) if you know what I mean." 
</P>
<P>
 Forry said she interpreted Estrada's last remarks to mean that he would not 
protect her client if Pentis became violent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand their need to get information," Forry said. "But the 
Constitution says you're not allowed to go about getting information in a way 
that's going to violate people's rights. They just simply didn't follow that." 
</P>
<P>
 Pentis, who has been promoted to sergeant in recent months, and Allaire were 
off duty Monday and unavailable for comment. Chief Deputy Robert Brooks said he 
could not comment on McGrath's ruling because he was not specifically aware of 
the basis the judge used to make it. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said Pentis and Allaire are experienced officers who carry out their 
duties with integrity. Neither one would ever do anything that may later be 
used to cause a judge to dismiss charges, Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our investigators have an interest in protecting the viability of the case," 
Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin J. McGee agreed. "They don't do business that 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers representing the two other defendants -- William Huang and John Yi -- 
lauded the judge's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear from the tape that they bullied (the confession) out of him, and 
that's not acceptable," said William T. Graysen, Yi's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the judge said that Estrada was the most verbally abusive toward 
Sonethanouphet, defense attorneys in the case said the deputies were obliged to 
intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should have stepped in and stopped it," Graysen said.

NEW AIDS CASES MAY BE DOWN IN '94; HEALTH: OFFICIALS SAY A CHANGE MADE IN 1993 
BROADENING FEDERAL GUIDELINES THAT DEFINE THE DISEASE MAY SKEW FIGURES FOR THIS 
YEAR.

<P>
 The number of new AIDS cases reported in Ventura County is expected to decline 
slightly this year after leveling off in 1993, but health officials say those 
figures may be skewed because of a change in the federal guidelines that define 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 After rising steadily for four years, the number of new cases dropped from 89 
in 1992 to 81 in 1993, said Martina Rippey, a county public health nurse who 
tracks AIDS cases. So far, 52 cases have been reported this year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the federal Centers for Disease Control expanded the definition of 
AIDS to include patients with low T-cell counts and some individuals who have 
recurring pneumonia, invasive cervical cancer or pulmonary tuberculosis, Rippey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The broader guidelines led county health officials to revise figures on AIDS 
cases for the past five years and to count many patients with low T-cell counts 
among the 1993 cases. Under the old guidelines, those individuals would not 
have been counted until they developed a related illness. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, she said, some patients who would probably not have been included 
as new AIDS cases until this year were counted last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have a glitch in this year's number," Rippey said. "My assumption is 
that in 1995 we'll start to climb again. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt that the infection is continuing to spread and the number of 
AIDS cases is continuing to grow," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Homosexual and bisexual men still account for the vast majority of the 
county's AIDS patients -- 71% -- but the number of AIDS-related illnesses 
diagnosed among women is growing at a faster rate, Rippey said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the county's immunology clinic, about 16% of the 270 patients infected with 
the human immunodeficiency virus or who have acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome are women, up from 10% at the same time last year. 
</P>
<P>
 As of July 1, a total of 444 AIDS cases had been diagnosed in Ventura County 
since 1989. Of those, 285 have died. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the figures showing a two-year plateau in new cases, AIDS workers said 
the demand for medical services in this county has not slowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. John G. Prichard, director of the county's immunology clinic, said he sees 
seven to 10 new patients a month, a rate about the same as last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the women seeking treatment at the clinic were infected by having sex 
with intravenous drug users, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from an increase in the number of female patients, Prichard said more 
Latinos are seeking treatment at the clinic. Latinos now make up about 24% of 
all clinic patients and about 28% of the AIDS cases diagnosed in Ventura 
County, Prichard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a nationwide trend, the average age of new patients in Ventura 
County has also dropped, particularly for gay men. In 1989, the average patient 
was in his upper-30s. Today, the typical new patient is in his mid-20s, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Older gay men are far more aware of this infection and how to prevent it," 
Prichard said. "Younger people tend to think of themselves as being immortal." 
</P>
<P>
 For the past 18 months, an outreach program staffed by county workers has 
sought to reach drug abusers and their sex partners who otherwise might not 
seek treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1-million federally funded HIV Outreach Intervention Team has for the 
past two years contacted more than 1,000 people every three months, offering 
free condoms, bleach kits for needles, AIDS testing and counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the hundreds of people tested, only three have tested positive for the AIDS 
virus, said Marsha Flower, the project's supervisor. She said she was not 
surprised by the small number. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a marked change in clients taking precautions to protect 
themselves in whatever area their risks are," she said. "And there's a whole 
group of the population that never test who could be positive."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: JEWISH GROUP SHIFTS MISSION TO NETWORKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON GRANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A local Jewish fund-raising organization has changed its name and its mission: 
To reflect an increased emphasis on building western Ventura County's Jewish 
community, the United Jewish Appeal of Western Ventura County has become the 
UJA Federation of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The title better identifies the 10-year-old nonprofit agency as not just a 
fund-raising group but also as a networking organization trying to coordinate 
programs with other west county Jewish groups, new Executive Director Eitan 
Ginsburg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginsburg said the west county's Jewish community has grown significantly, 
pointing out that new congregations have formed in Camarillo and Ojai. More 
Jewish families are moving into the area, and those already in the area are 
increasingly affiliating with a Jewish organization, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the growth, funds raised by the federation have doubled to more 
than $200,000 a year, Ginsburg said. About half of the funds are used to 
support west county Jewish groups and events, while the rest is sent to Israel 
and Jewish communities overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Wolfsohn, a board member of the new Jewish congregation in Camarillo, 
said that as word about that group spread, members discovered many longtime 
Jewish residents who had not socialized and worshiped together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call us the closet Jews," she said. "We've been around but haven't had a 
place in Camarillo where we can meet and worship and educate our children." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Michael Berk of Temple Beth Torah in Ventura agreed that the western 
county is seeing some growth in its Jewish population. But even more, he said, 
there has been a jump in the numbers of longtime residents identifying 
themselves with Jewish groups. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three years he has served as the temple's rabbi, Berk said, there has 
been a small but consistent net growth by about 50 to 60 members. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginsburg said his agency is focusing more money and efforts on the local 
community. "We're trying to strengthen the Jewish community," Ginsburg said. 
"We want people to affiliate. A lot of Jews don't affiliate with any synagogue, 
organization. They're there, they know they're Jewish, but they don't identify 
themselves to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The new Ojai congregation -- the Jewish Community of the Oaks -- offers both 
social gatherings and religious services. Its president, David R. Feigin, said 
he has met dozens of Jews who have moved to the Ojai Valley, especially from 
Los Angeles, through his work as a realtor. Many of those Jews had been 
yearning for more chances to gather, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are about 20 churches, I believe, in the Ojai area, and there was no 
place for Jewish people to get together," he said. JASON GRANT

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; LAWSUIT IS FILED IN MURDER-FOR-HIRE 
CASE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Westlake businessman under investigation in connection with an alleged 
murder-for-hire plot targeting his ex-wife has filed a lawsuit against her for 
publicly blaming him in the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee R. Mannheimer filed the lawsuit against his former wife, Linda, in Ventura 
County Superior Court on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Mannheimer said she believed the suit was filed to discourage her from 
making statements during a deposition in a separate lawsuit Lee Mannheimer 
filed against the couple's former bank. Linda Mannheimer is scheduled to be 
interviewed for the deposition today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not concerned about it," Linda Mannheimer said of the latest lawsuit. "I 
didn't say anything that wasn't true." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit accuses Linda Mannheimer of making "false, malicious and 
unprivileged" statements about her ex-husband to reporters from three 
newspapers, including The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Mannheimer has denied any involvement in the plot and no charges have been 
filed against him. 
</P>
<P>
 In articles published by the newspapers, Linda Mannheimer was quoted as saying 
she believed her husband wanted to kill her and initiated the plot against her 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Mannheimer said the published accounts caused him emotional damage and the 
loss of his job as president and chief executive officer of PerfectData Corp., 
a company based in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities uncovered the plot to kill Linda Mannheimer last October after an 
FBI informant reported that he had been offered $10,000 to kill the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 One suspect has been charged with solicitation to commit murder, and the 
Ventura County district attorney's office is investigating Mannheimer and 
another man in the case, officials have said. JULIE FIELDS

<P>
 A Thousand Oaks woman was robbed of her wedding ring and other jewelry Monday 
afternoon in The Oaks mall parking lot by a man who threatened her with a metal 
object against her neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Ann Wells, 31, ran to the Bullocks department store after the assailant 
took her wedding ring, watch and diamond bracelet at about 12:45 p.m. at 222 W. 
Hillcrest Drive, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Ron Tusi said the suspect, believed to be in his 20s, approached Wells 
from behind while she was standing at the open driver-side door of her car. The 
man put a metal object against the back of her neck, Tusi said, while telling 
her to hand over her jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 She did and he fled north on foot through the parking lot, toward Hillcrest 
Drive, Tusi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, who eluded authorities despite an extensive search, was described as 
having blond hair and wearing a green flannel shirt, with a tattoo of barbed 
wire on his right wrist, Tusi said. GREG RIPPEE

 The Conejo Valley Adult School Literacy Program is seeking volunteers to tutor 
adults in basic literacy skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Tutors -- who do not need a background in teaching -- will be expected to work 
with adult students for a minimum of two hours a week, during weekdays or 
evenings, at the adult school's literacy center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a program well-established that has up to 90 tutors during the school 
year," said Literacy Coordinator Marge Ceran. "(But) during the fall classes we 
try to get about 25 new tutors." 
</P>
<P>
 Tutors work one-on-one with students, teaching reading, writing, spelling and 
speaking skills, Ceran said. During the past two years, the literacy program 
has served about 105 students annually.  
</P>
<P>
 A free workshop for interested volunteers will be held from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 
p.m. Saturday, Oct. 1, at the adult school's learning center, 1025 Old Farm 
Road in Thousand Oaks.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; VOLUNTEER HELPS CROATIAN NATIVE LEARN NEW 
SKILL 
</P>

<P>
 Anna Marusic put off her education more than 18 years ago to tend to her 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, the Ventura resident, a native of Croatia, spends up to eight 
hours a week in the county library studying English and learning to read in the 
language she has spoken for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never was able to spend too much time with books," she said during a 
tutoring session at the Helen P. Wright Library in Ventura last week. "I was 
always working and taking care of my family." 
</P>
<P>
 After four months in the county's adult reading program, Marusic is well into 
her fourth lesson book and can read such traditional American publications as 
newspapers and magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 "She understands quite a bit already," said Terry Cicone, a former elementary 
school teacher and Marusic's volunteer tutor. "But the basic phonics and 
vocabulary in this program help her immensely." 
</P>
<P>
 They met earlier this year, after Marusic decided to study English and Cicone 
was looking for a way to contribute to the community. They have since become 
close friends who spend much more time together than the two hours a week a 
typical tutor donates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came over for a lesson last week and Anna had a whole dinner cooked for 
me," Cicone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cicone is one of about 400 volunteer tutors who spend a couple of hours a week 
teaching adult students the fundamentals of English. 
</P>
<P>
 For Pat Flanigan, director of the Ventura County Library Services Agency adult 
reading program, the match of Cicone and Marusic is a perfect one. 
</P>
<P>
 "It works because of the one-on-one attention that these students get," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually these are people that are not comfortable in classroom situations, 
either because they've been away from school for a long time or they didn't 
perform well while they were there," Flanigan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the students enrolling in the program already speak English, but they 
have never studied it formally, Flanigan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anna put off her own education in order to take care of her family," Flanigan 
said. "But she's typical in the sense that at least half of our students speak 
English as a second language. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be very difficult for someone like her to start (learning to read) 
in a classroom," she added. JEFF McDONALD

FREE SPEECH ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Aug. 28, a letter was printed from Tracy Harvey of Moorpark regarding a man 
berating Jews and homosexuals in a restaurant and only her sister responding to 
him. Ms. Harvey's letter went on to ask: What should have been done? What would 
the reader have done? What did the average German or Polish citizen do during 
the 1940s? 
</P>
<P>
 As wrong as it may seem, there is nothing that can be done because we are a 
nation of free speech, regardless of how bigoted and ill-informed anyone is.A 
restaurant is not the place to challenge, teach or attempt to change anyone's 
interpretation of Scripture, right or wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Asking what the Polish people were doing in the same sentence with the Germans 
is ludicrous. The Polish people have suffered persecution throughout their 
history. According to the World Book Encyclopedia, Poland suffered more than 
any other country in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 What were the German and Polish people doing in the 1940s? We know what the 
Germans were doing. Some of the Polish people were attempting just to survive. 
Others went underground to fight. Some escaped to England where a Polish air 
force was formed. Survivors of Schindler's list have testified many were hidden 
by the Polish people. Others left to countries that would take them. Millions 
of Polish people along with the Jews were sent to Auschwitz. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope Ms. Harvey would realize Jews were not the only people in concentration 
camps. There were people of every nationality, many simply because they were 
Christians, especially those that chose to hide their Jewish friends and 
neighbors.

TIME FOR A TRUCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After reading the article, "Velthoen Says His Image Was Damaged," Sept. 1, I 
came to the conclusion that this whole thing is much ado about nothing. People 
say many things in jest not meaning them to be taken seriously, and this seems 
to be one of those times. But if Port Hueneme council member Toni Young's 
comments are to be taken seriously, then I think City Manager Dick Velthoen 
should look to himself for unfavorable comments he has made about Ms. Young -- 
and certainly he owes her an apology for the way he treats her during council 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 I have been present when he has been most sarcastic to Ms. Young and puts her 
down in front of the public. Somewhere along the line, something has gone awry. 
I thought the City Council members were Mr. Velthoen's employers. Instead it 
seems they have given him carte blanche to do whatever he wants and he is their 
employer. 
</P>
<P>
 I honestly think the city manager feels that he is doing good things for Port 
Hueneme. The trouble is that this is his assumption. Why didn't he and the City 
Council submit a referendum or at least take a representative poll of the 
voters to find out how they felt about the RV park and some of the other issues 
that have divided the city? 
</P>
<P>
 As I see it, until Toni Young was elected to the council, the city manager 
pretty much had his way. But when she differed with him and stood up to him as 
she should have done if that was her belief, he found someone who had the guts 
to stand up to him and that has made him very angry. I think it is time to call 
a truce and get on with city business.

 An elderly Ventura woman who was killed in a traffic accident near Mugu Rock 
while being shuttled home from an Alaskan cruise has been identified as 
Virginia Lorraine Danford. 
</P>
<P>
 Danford, 75, was killed in a multi-car accident Saturday night that stopped 
traffic on Pacific Coast Highway for about two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 She and her friend, 75-year-old Grace Toy of Ventura, were passengers in a car 
operated by a local shuttle service that had picked them up at Los Angeles 
International Airport, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Coroner Craig Stevens said the two had taken a flight from Vancouver, 
British Columbia, after a 10-day Alaskan cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred when a van traveling south on Pacific Coast Highway spun 
out of control and careened into their northbound car, which in turn was struck 
by another northbound vehicle, Officer Brian DeMattia of the California Highway 
Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 Toy, who was taken to St. John's Pleasant Valley Hospital in Camarillo, was 
reported in fair condition Monday night. GREG RIPPEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CITY AGREES TO BACK LOCAL MILITARY BASES

 The city of Ventura on Monday night became the first in Ventura County to 
commit money to keeping Point Mugu and Port Hueneme naval bases running, 
pledging $19,930 to a community task force. 
</P>
<P>
 Task force members urged the city council to contribute money immediately 
toward the efforts, saying other communities around the country have already 
poured millions into keeping their bases from being shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've already suffered severely from the defense cutbacks," Mayor Tom Buford 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council was approached for funds by a local task force organized to 
lobby the federal Base Realignment and Closure Commission. Although the 
commission will not release its list of base closures until early next year, 
the task force has begun early on the theory that the best time to save a 
military base is before it is officially targeted for closure. 
</P>
<P>
 The BRAC '95 Task Force has already received $10,000 and free office space 
from the Ventura County Board of Supervisors.  
</P>
<P>
 The task force will also approach Camarillo and Oxnard this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is seeking about $350,000 from local governments and agencies to 
support their efforts. They are hoping to get about $150,000 from Ventura 
County and city governments, $50,000 from companies with government contracts, 
$50,000 in donations from federal employees and $100,000 from the Ventura 
County business community at large. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; 2 MEN IN DRUG BUST TO BE ARRAIGNED TODAY 
</P>

<P>
 Two Anaheim men who were arrested in Ventura during a joint undercover 
operation that snared about $60,000 worth of cocaine and heroin are to be 
arraigned today in Ventura County Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Alejandro M. Hernandez, 23, and Jerardo M. Contreras, 20, were being held 
Monday in Ventura County Jail in lieu of $100,000 bail, sheriff's Sgt. Fred 
Bustillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two were arrested Friday in the Toys-R-Us parking lot at Johnson Drive and 
Ventura Road, where authorities also seized a kilogram of cocaine and an ounce 
of tar heroine from the front seat of their pickup truck, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the drugs they confiscated, authorities raided a house in 
Orange County and seized more than $25,000 in cash, all of it in small 
denominations, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is more for street users," Lt. Pat Miller of the Ventura Police 
Department said of the seized drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the suspects were believed to be couriers for an organized group 
in Anaheim that has been selling to Ventura County drug users "for some time." 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects, who had arranged to sell the drugs to an undercover officer at 
the parking lot, were targets of the newly formed Ventura-Oxnard Narcotic 
Enforcement Team. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said the team includes officials from the Ventura and Oxnard police 
departments, the Ventura County Sheriff's Department, the FBI and the federal 
Drug Enforcement Administration. GREG RIPPEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; EX-OFFICIAL ASKS FOR NEW TRIAL IN THEFT

<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael E. Wooten, a Ventura County transportation commissioner and one-time 
promoter of a card-club casino for Oxnard who was convicted of felony grand 
theft in July, asked a judge for a new trial Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Allan L. Steele was scheduled to sentence Wooten, of 
Camarillo, for the theft conviction Monday.Instead, the judge gave the 
defendant until Nov. 18 to file his motion requesting a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooten's attorney, George E. Eskin, said the defense needs the extra time to 
obtain a copy of the transcript from the first jury trial and review the 
document. Wooten also is a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 If the conviction stands, Wooten would be barred from his seat on the 
Transportation Commission and would also lose his license to practice law, 
Eskin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a lot at stake," Eskin said. Prosecutors did oppose Monday's deal, 
although they asked the judge to hold the hearing for a new trial sooner. But 
Steele said the defense needed all the time it was allotted to file its motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooten's theft conviction stemmed from a private construction deal unrelated 
to the casino proposal or his activities as a transportation commissioner.

FALSE DESCRIPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The letter from Douglas Hewitson (Letters to the Editor, Aug. 23) gave an 
entirely false description of my position on requiring that Congress abide by 
the same laws that apply to the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that I have long advocated ending congressional exemption from 
these laws that cover the private sector and I was responsible for 
strengthening the provisions in the compliance bill before the House approved 
it by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 427 to 4. 
</P>
<P>
 As chairman of the subcommittee that developed the Congressional 
Accountability Act, I made sure that Congress will be covered under all 
pertinent laws and by twice as many as recommended in the original measure. The 
bill we reported, and which was eventually passed by the House, also gives more 
authority and independence to the compliance office to enforce the law and 
congressional compliance. 
</P>
<P>
 I also believe that members of Congress should be subject to the same rules 
for health care benefits as every other American, and I voted for an amendment 
to the compliance bill with that requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 It is simply wrong for Congress to insulate itself from the effect of laws 
that apply to the private sector. For Mr. Hewitson or anyone else to assert 
that I believe otherwise is not only irresponsible, but also dead wrong.

HMO SQUEEZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The article "Doctors and Patients Feel Squeeze From HMOs" on Sept. 4 was 
interesting indeed. It is also quite disturbing for me and pinches a raw nerve 
or two in me.I believe that I'm personally enjoying the bitter experience of 
encountering the squeeze from an HMO. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm a former state employee with a reasonable health plan to cover my dental 
needs, so I thought. A year ago I claimed a dental service from my health 
provider, and eight months later, after much wrangling, my claim was approved. 
I was happy to finally receive much-needed dental care. I was wrong. Instead of 
sending me to the "nearest office," as my agreement with the insurance provider 
stated, I was directed to El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe that there is need for legislative reform which requires procedural 
changes designed to ensure that medical decisions are based upon medical rather 
than entrepreneurial considerations (By the way, the insurance provider insists 
that I visit its El Segundo office for the reason that the insurance provider 
owns it.) Therefore, Gov. Wilson should sign the components of this reform, AB 
3801, SB 1348 and SB 1832; especially AB 3801, which requires disclosure of 
administrative costs.  
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, I am waiting, waiting for a response to my appeal. Who knows, 
I may get an answer -- around Christmas. As the song goes, "All I want for 
Christmas is my two front teeth."

TEST CENTER REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Aug. 5, Sen. Dianne Feinstein announced a proposal for the Southwest Air 
Systems Research Development, Testing and Evaluation Complex, consisting of 
Point Mugu and seven other large test centers. This is not new. As part of the 
Presidential Blue Ribbon Panel for reforming the Department of Defense, G.H. 
Sylvester, USAF, proposed the first basic consolidation of all test ranges in 
June, 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1989, as chairman of the Department of Defense Select Test Range 
Assessment Panel, I re-proposed such consolidations, including the prototyping 
of a "Southwest Range Network," including Point Mugu and five other major test 
centers. It also wasn't implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 Three major obstacles resist such changes. The civilian bureaucracies, 
particularly in Washington, resist such changes as it diminishes their power 
over subordinate fiefdoms. The military opposes such changes as it reduces the 
opportunities for flag-rank commands at these test centers and ranges. The most 
critical impediment is the lack of congressional control, by the lack of 
appropriate and dedicated funding controls. Department of Defense Test Centers 
are subsidized mainly with research and development funds, from a general 
appropriation category. A new funding category is required for test centers, 
dedicated and controlled apart from any other category such as development, 
production, logistics and operations. Congress then could control such 
appropriations. Sen. Feinstein will be opposed for the same reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, significant restructuring, re-engineering and re-architecture of 
all test centers is needed for effective reform. The rest of the Department of 
Defense laboratories, the 10 major NASA centers and various test organizations 
from the departments of Energy, Transportation and Commerce should be 
integrated to form a viable National Test Agency as a macrocosm of U.S. 
post-Cold War policy. Technology exists today to begin this quest with 
significant long-term tax savings and better performance. Test and evaluation 
as a profession remains insensitive to the origin of the benefiting 
organization or what uniform it serves.

JUDGE ALLOWS USE OF THORNTON JAIL VISIT REMARKS; TRIAL: PROSECUTION WILL BE 
ABLE TO PLAY TAPED CONVERSATION BETWEEN GRANDMOTHER AND SUSPECT CHARGED IN 
WESTLAKE NURSE'S DEATH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Prosecutors may use incriminating statements made by Mark Scott Thornton 
during a jailhouse visit with his grandmother in their effort to convict the 
Thousand Oaks man of kidnaping and killing a Westlake nurse, a judge ruled 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath denied a defense motion 
that sought to keep jurors from hearing the conversation taped last year 
between Thornton and his grandmother, Lois Thornton. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath's ruling struck another blow to Thornton's defense team, which has 
lost a series of pretrial motions filed before jury selection begins Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're disappointed that (McGrath) overruled our motion," Deputy Public 
Defender Howard J. Asher said outside the courtroom Monday. He said Thornton 
"was subjected to improper police tactics, (with investigators) using his 
grandmother to try to extract certain statements." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors declined to disclose details of the conversation between Thornton 
and his grandmother.  
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office alleges that Thornton, 20, kidnaped Westlake 
nurse Kellie O'Sullivan last September, stole her car, shot her to death and 
dumped her body in a remote area of the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He is also accused of kidnaping his former girlfriend and shooting at the 
girl's mother, then fleeing with the 16-year-old to Reno, Nev., where he was 
arrested days later inside a casino. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris argued Monday that there is ample case 
history that allows investigators to record conversations between inmates and 
relatives, then use those tapes at trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see how anyone can consider Lois Thornton a government agent," 
Kossoris told McGrath. "She didn't get anything that was of benefit to her." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys had argued that Lois Thornton was manipulated by sheriff's 
detectives into getting her grandson to incriminate himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're claiming there's been a constitutional privilege that's been violated," 
argued Deputy Public Defender Susan Olson, one of Thornton's two defense 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 In other decisions Monday, McGrath denied a defense request to disallow 
evidence seized from Thornton's Thousand Oaks home days after the kidnapings. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath ruled that Detective Dennis Reed and his partner had sufficient cause 
to enter and search the room without a warrant, in part because the suspect was 
on probation for a prior conviction for breaking into a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors on Monday declined to discuss what evidence was seized inside the 
room Thornton rented in the 1800 block of Marview Drive. But they disclosed 
that Thornton wrote a suicide note two months before he was arrested for 
murder, and has a history of mental instability. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Asher argued that early discussions between Thornton and police should not be 
allowed at trial because of "significant ambiguity" about whether his client 
waived his right not to speak to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense attorney said Thornton agreed only to answer certain questions, 
and refused to discuss more detailed aspects of the kidnapings of O'Sullivan 
and his former girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 But McGrath disagreed, ruling before prosecutors could respond that Thornton 
fully understood his right not to speak to police. "I feel his waiver was free 
and voluntary," McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the judge refused to remove some misdemeanor theft charges from 
Thornton's murder prosecution, and also decided to allow jurors to see graphic 
photographs of the O'Sullivan crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial is expected to last more than two months. 
</P>
<P>
 If Thornton is convicted, the penalty phase of the trial -- in which jurors 
would decide whether he should be put to death or spend life in prison -- could 
stretch into February. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath has yet to rule on whether a prosecution witness named "Erika" can 
testify, if there is a sentencing phase of the trial, that Thornton committed 
sexual improprieties against her and once threatened her safety.

ANGRY WESTLAKE LAKE RESIDENTS SAY THEY HAVE BEEN LEFT HIGH AND DRY; DISPUTE: 
DOCKS REST ON DIRT AS NEARBY GOLF COURSE LEGALLY SIPHONS WATER. HOMEOWNERS WANT 
ACTION, BUT MANAGEMENT SAYS IT IS POWERLESS TO STOP THE PUMPING. 
</P>

<P>
 A battle over water has erupted on tranquil Westlake Lake, where residents 
this week watched lake levels dip to record lows while the owners of a nearby 
golf course sprinkled the links with hundreds of gallons of lake water. 
</P>
<P>
 So angry are the residents that they have initiated a vitriolic letter-writing 
campaign to decry lake management and call for the end to a decades-old 
agreement giving the golf course water rights.  
</P>
<P>
 Residents said in letters circulated this week that they can no longer allow 
the lake's water level to drop. On the lake's perimeter, docks rest on dry dirt 
and boats scrape the lake floor. Small islands of land have surfaced where the 
water was once deep and glassy. 
</P>
<P>
 Statements sent out to the 1,200 residents who live along the man-made lake, 
which straddles the border between Ventura and Los Angeles counties, call for 
the ouster of Ben Schulman, president of the lake management association. 
</P>
<P>
 And the letters object to a proposed contract with the owners of the Westlake 
Village Golf Course that would continue to allow greenskeepers to siphon 
hundreds of gallons of lake water each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight residents of the once-quiet community are expected to confront the 
lake's nine-member management board with their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a wild meeting," said lakeside homeowner William Rolland. 
"People are extremely concerned about our board allowing the golf course to 
rape our lake." 
</P>
<P>
 Schulman, who has been involved in managing the lake for six years, said the 
campaign against him has been rife with misinformation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Westlake Lake Management Assn., he said, does not have the power to 
prevent golf course owners from taking lake water. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the lake and the Westlake Village Golf Course were built by the 
American-Hawaiian Steamship Co. in the late 1960s. The developer included in 
the code that governs the lake's management a requirement that the golf course 
have access to the lake water. Schulman said he believes that stipulation 
cannot be changed, but residents disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 Only when the lake's surface level drops 24 inches can the lake managers cut 
off the golf-course supply. Schulman estimates the level is presently 14 to 16 
inches below normal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've looked at the agreements and I've talked with lawyers," he said. "We 
just don't have the right to ask them to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the dispute between Schulman and a band of residents who say 
they represent 80% of the homeowners has been the fate of two wells that are 
used to pump water into the lake from an aquifer, one of several sources of 
lake water. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, the federal government awarded ownership of the wells to Los 
Angeles-based PYJ Corp., the company that bought the golf course in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The company received title to the wells even though area homeowners, through 
the lake management association, had for 20 years been paying to service and 
operate them. 
</P>
<P>
 A contract with PYJ, Schulman said, would mean the homeowners would regain 
part ownership of the wells, and the golf course would have to begin paying for 
some pumping and repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I wanted to do was raise this as a possibility, given that the golf 
course has been getting a free ride for water," Schulman said. "What I've 
gotten in return have been these outrageous attacks." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One anonymous letter accuses Schulman of betraying the homeowners and another 
includes personal attacks against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolland, one of those leading the effort against Schulman, said the anger 
behind the letters is warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we enter into this kind of agreement, we would be selling out half the 
lake for the next 200 years," Rolland said. "It would be a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Schulman said he hoped some kind of arrangement could be made to prevent the 
golf course from extracting water for free, but he will no longer push for the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks Planning Commissioner Irving Wasserman, who lives in the lake 
community, said he will ask the cities of Thousand Oaks and Westlake Village to 
create an oversight committee to help resolve these issues more calmly in the 
future.

 "Both cities have a tremendous stake in seeing that the lake remains a viable 
entity," Wasserman said. "We need to make sure there is enough oversight to 
prevent it from being siphoned away." 
</P>
<P>
 Rolland said he plans at tonight's meeting to ask for a change in the lake 
association's codes to prevent the golf course from using any more water. The 
proposal, he said, would recommend that the board use its funds to begin 
drilling a new well. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will be held at 7 tonight at the Westlake Yacht Club, 32123 W. 
Lindero Canyon Road, Westlake Village.

REVIEWS ARE MIXED FOR BRAND-NEW CITY HALL; THOUSAND OAKS: PART OF CIVIC ARTS 
PLAZA, FACILITY'S STARK DESIGN GIVES SOME PEOPLE THE CHILLS. OTHERS APPRECIATE 
THE AIRY ALLOTMENT OF SPACE.

 Every time David Zeman looks up from the planning department counter, his gaze 
smacks into a concrete wall. 
</P>
<P>
 A blotchy concrete wall, studded with exposed steel pegs and laced with 
hairline cracks. A bleak wall that pretty much reflects Zeman's opinion of 
Thousand Oaks' new City Hall at the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's stupid," said Zeman, a planning technician. "We spend $64 million on the 
building, and we have to look at this. This building wasn't designed for 
employees." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet just upstairs, City Clerk Nancy Dillon looked ready to dance a jig as she 
gleefully showed off her spacious new office, with a view of feathery oak 
trees. Across the hall, she waltzed through a room designated just for 
microfilm research -- a room so spacious, Dillon said, that "we don't know how 
to act in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in jeans and a T-shirt -- a wardrobe she resorted to after ripping 
three sets of nylon stockings while moving boxes -- Dillon rejoiced in the 
user-friendly design of Thousand Oaks' fourth city hall in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're home," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conflicting views about the Civic Arts Plaza echoed through the freshly 
painted halls on Monday. As employees dashed about unpacking boxes and 
answering questions, citizens wandered past the whining buzz saw at the front 
entrance to gawk at the government's new digs. 
</P>
<P>
 A huge purple banner and clusters of purple, turquoise and white balloons 
welcomed visitors. So did a card-table "reception desk," which City Manager 
Grant Brimhall established. Employees will take turns staffing the table, 
answering questions and meeting the citizen-customers they're supposed to 
serve. 
</P>
<P>
 Above the din of ongoing construction work, senior management analyst Carol 
Williams explained the Civic Arts Plaza's layout, referring often to her 
laminated maps. She also happily accepted compliments on the foyer's soaring 
ceilings, gleaming walls and festive air. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so completely different that people are very much wowed when they walk 
in," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel Rosen, a 20-year resident, was so wowed, in fact, that he declared the 
towering building looked like a modern-day version of an Egyptian pyramid. 
"What they need is a statue of Ramses on top," he proposed, grinning. 
</P>
<P>
 The stark architecture didn't inspire much joking from Violet Mann, a Thousand 
Oaks resident since 1960. "It's ugly," she said bluntly. 
</P>
<P>
 And even Councilwoman Judy Lazar, long an enthusiastic cheerleader for the 
Civic Arts Plaza, expressed some doubt about the exposed concrete walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Architect Antoine Predock deliberately left the first-floor walls bare, with 
the steel support rods poking through, to reinforce his trademark geometric 
style. But Lazar, calling the look "not terribly attractive," said she plans to 
investigate alternatives, hoping to "finish it off in some way." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks' electronic bulletin board should be up and running this week, 
allowing residents with personal computers easy access to a disk-full of 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By dialing the city through a modem, citizens can scroll through council 
agendas, theater schedules, phone directories and other information. They can 
download data onto their personal computers to print out for reference. And 
they can leave electronic messages for employees or council members. 
</P>
<P>
 John Augustyn, information services manager, has not yet been able to set up 
the computer to take appointment requests or log ticket reservations. So for 
most City Hall business, residents will still have to trek to the Civic Arts 
Plaza at 2100 Thousand Oaks Blvd. In the funky new building, they will find at 
least one familiar feature. 
</P>
<P>
 Said architect Daniel Witting as he waited to review blueprints with a 
planner: "The line isn't any shorter than it was in the other place."

PARTNER IN WHITEFACE PROJECT FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION; SIMI VALLEY: BIG 
SKY RANCH, PART OF THE SAND CANYON DEVELOPMENT, HAS DEFAULTED ON COUNTY 
PROPERTY TAXES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the biggest players in Simi Valley's vast Whiteface development plan 
has filed for bankruptcy protection and defaulted on thousands of dollars in 
Ventura County property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Sky Ranch Co. had planned to use 1,000 acres of land in Sand Canyon on 
Simi Valley's northern edge for the construction of Wyndmere, a development of 
1,100 houses and a golf course for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the deal fell through in late 1992, Big Sky started ignoring its 
county bills on a total of 3,100 acres, including Wyndmere -- even though a tax 
break under a 1965 state farmland conservation measure called the Williamson 
Act allows the company to pay only pennies on each tax dollar, public records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in May, Big Sky sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Code because its former partner in the deal filed a claim for 
$2 million in unpaid pre-development fees, said James Wadsworth, president of 
Big Sky's parent company, W & B Builders. 
</P>
<P>
 And according to delinquent tax rolls released last week, Big Sky now owes the 
county $156,088 in property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 But until it emerges from Chapter 11, Wadsworth said, the company has no 
intention of settling the outstanding bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a shortage of cash in the partnership to cover the taxes," 
Wadsworth said. "There's been a number of obstacles to developing the land. 
It's difficult today with the depressed economy. We've just not been able to 
move forward with the plan at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 W & B has also ignored about $85,916 in back taxes owed on grazing land near 
the Big Sky property owned under the name of Alamos Canyon Co., because of the 
cash shortage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Assistant Tax Collector John McKinney called the situation sad. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate when you have developers who are getting a tax break through 
the Williamson Act who aren't complying," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Vicky L. Howard added: "Most of the money we collect in property 
taxes goes up to the state -- about 80% -- and it makes it hard for the state 
to pay their bills. And then they turn around and take it out on us. So the 
county really gets nicked in a situation like this." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wyndmere was to have been a big project for W & B Builders, which is partly 
owned by Watt Industries, a giant Santa Monica home building firm, Wadsworth 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lowe Development Corp. of Brentwood planned to buy the land and develop 
Wyndmere there, offering detached homes and a golf course to buyers age 55 and 
older, said Stuart Cramer, Lowe's vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 But while still in escrow in late 1992, Lowe decided -- for reasons Cramer 
would not outline -- to back out of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked at everything and chose not to proceed," he said. The agreement 
between Lowe and Big Sky gave the latter company a year to pay back about $2 
million in pre-development fees that Lowe had fronted for Wyndmere, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Big Sky failed to pay by last fall, Lowe filed a legal claim and began 
foreclosure proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Big Sky filed for Chapter 11 protection on May 3 -- the day before the 
foreclosure sale was to take place, Cramer said. U.S. Court documents show the 
company owed creditors $2,315,949 while holding property worth $23,237,083. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wadsworth acknowledged the bankruptcy filing was meant to give Big Sky time to 
pay Lowe back, but he added: "It was a legal maneuver to protect the assets of 
the overall partnership." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the land -- once used for filming of the "Little House on the Prairie" 
TV series -- still provides modest income to Big Sky from filming fees. And 
some of the land is used for cattle grazing, but no profit comes from that, 
Wadsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless Big Sky can sell the Wyndmere parcel or any of the others, the taxes 
will have to wait, Wadsworth said. But he said Big Sky has no intention of 
letting the taxes wait another three years, which would trigger foreclosure and 
sale of the land by the county tax collector's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the process of marketing the parcels, and there's just few buyers 
out there today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said of the situation, "It's a really difficult time, and I think there 
are probably a lot of folks right now -- large companies and individuals -- who 
are having trouble meeting their bills." 
</P>
<P>
 But she added: "I'm a little surprised at developers when they don't pay their 
taxes, because there's heavy penalties on not paying."

OBITUARIES ; ORVILLE DAHL; FOUNDED CAL LUTHERAN UNIVERSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dr. Orville Dahl, the first and founding president of Cal Lutheran University 
in Thousand Oaks, died Sunday in Carmichael, Calif. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
 He came to Southern California from Minnesota in 1957 as a representative of 
the Evangelical Lutheran Church. The church wanted to build a liberal arts 
college in California, and sent Dahl to find a good location. 
</P>
<P>
 For several months Dahl searched for the right spot, traveling from Modesto to 
Riverside and up the coast to San Luis Obispo, said Stephen Wheatly, associate 
director of the Cal Lutheran Educational Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to find a location, Dahl returned home, telling his wife, Jean, "If God 
wants it, he is going to have to find the site himself." She reminded him he 
still had one trip to make -- to Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 After he returned and was looking at a piece of land in Thousand Oaks, a 
farmer named Richard Pederson pulled up in his truck, removed a newspaper 
article about Dahl's search from his breast pocket, and said: "I've been 
expecting you." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the single greatest moment of my life," Dahl told Wheatly last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day Pederson turned the deed over to Dahl. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of Orville Dahl's vision and passion, there is a university in 
Thousand Oaks," said Luther Luedtke, Cal Lutheran's current president. "Where 
others saw dirt farmland, he had the vision and belief to see a distinguished 
college." 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife; two sons, Orin and Richard; two daughters, 
Elizabeth and Leonore; nine grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. In 
lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Dr. Orville Dahl Memorial Fund at 
Cal Lutheran, 60 W. Olsen Road, Thousand Oaks 91360, c/o Della Greenlee.

PREP EXTRA; THE CLASS OF '95: SENIORS TO WATCH; ALSO LIKELY TO SUCCEED; SAN 
CLEMENTE'S SAMPERI LEADS OUTSTANDING CROP OF COUNTY ATHLETES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coaches from Nebraska already have called Brett Samperi's house. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice. 
</P>
<P>
 That should indicate how good the San Clemente senior offensive lineman is. 
Nebraska coaches may not know much about winning bowl games, but they do know a 
quality lineman when they see one. The program, after all, has produced six 
Outland Trophy winners. 
</P>
<P>
 Samperi, a 6-foot-5, 270-pound tackle, started the final three games of his 
sophomore season and was a second-team All-South Coast League selection last 
season. Recruiters seem to think a little more of him than that, as Samperi 
does not lack for company. He has been contacted by every Pacific 10 team and 
many other heavy hitters from across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brett is one of the most impressive kids I've seen," San Clemente Coach Mark 
McElroy said. "I've seen him drive guys back 10-15 yards, then put them into 
the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Samperi is the county's top senior to watch this year in football, but the 
standout athletes from the Class of '95 are not limited to that sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a look at some seniors to keep an eye on during the upcoming school 
year: BADMINTON 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Pak, Garden Grove 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Pak, who reached the round of 16 in last year's Southern Section singles 
tournament, has been a three-time all-league selection and compiled a 46-8 
record en route to leading Garden Grove to the section title in her first year 
of singles play. 
</P>
<P>
 Pak, The Times Orange County girls' player of the year for 1994, has increased 
her off-season training and tournament schedule, and her focus, combined with 
her power, quickness and incredible tenacity, make her the player to watch. 
BASEBALL 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Valent, Canyon 
</P>
<P>
 Hitting is Eric Valent's forte. The left-hander has one of the county's 
smoothest swings, which enables him to drive the ball to all fields. 
</P>
<P>
 A starter since his sophomore season, Valent, 17, is a two-time All-Century 
League selection. Valent (5 feet 11, 170 pounds) maintained a torrid pace last 
season while batting third for the Comanches, who had the county's top offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Valent, a member of The Times' all-county baseball team, batted .417 with five 
home runs and 33 runs batted in. He further distinguished himself at the Area 
Code Games in Long Beach, an annual showcase for the top players entering their 
senior seasons, and the Olympic Festival at St. Louis, where he batted .429. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a real good, compact, powerful swing," Canyon Coach Mike Najera said. 
"He'll probably go down as the greatest player Canyon ever had." BOYS' 
BASKETBALL 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Gottlieb, Tustin 
</P>
<P>
 As a junior, Doug Gottlieb, 6-0, was one of the best point guards in the 
county, averaging 8.1 assists during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 According to his coach at Tustin, Andy Ground, Gottlieb will take his five 
recruiting visits to Notre Dame, Michigan State, Connecticut, Virginia and 
Florida. UCLA is also among Gottlieb's six final choices. GIRLS' BASKETBALL 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Burgess, Woodbridge 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Burgess has, in the past, been a lumbering giant for Woodbridge, but 
the 6-4 center showed a mobility and drive at the end of last season that hints 
of a spectacular senior campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 She averaged 13.3 points and 12.4 rebounds, and appears primed to be the 
dominant force necessary to lead the Warriors to a second consecutive State 
title game. BOYS' CROSS-COUNTRY 
</P>
<P>
 Adalberto Sanchez, Capistrano Valley 
</P>
<P>
 Adalberto Sanchez employed his aggressive running style to win the South Coast 
League titles the last two seasons. The Capistrano Valley senior likes to take 
the lead and make everybody play catch-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez finished third at the county championships as a junior and 12th at the 
State Division I finals. He also posted the fastest time at last year's Dana 
Hills Invitational. GIRLS' CROSS-COUNTRY 
</P>
<P>
 Eliaser Estrada, Santa Ana Valley 
</P>
<P>
 Eliaser Estrada came into her own as a junior at Santa Ana Valley, finishing 
third at the county championships. 
</P>
<P>
 After placing fourth at the Southern Section Division I-AA finals, she 
advanced to the State Division I championships, where she was seventh. Estrada 
was runner-up at the Century League finals last year. GOLF 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Lee, Sunny Hills 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Lee, the only girl on the Sunny Hills varsity, played a vital part in 
the Lancers' Southern Section team championship last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 She also won the CIF-Southern California Golf Assn. individual title, beating 
two-time defending champion Kellee Booth of Santa Margarita by one stroke. 
BOYS' SOCCER 
</P>
<P>
 Seth George, Santa Margarita 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Seth George is a two-time All-Sea View League first-team selection 
from Santa Margarita who scored 21 goals and had five assists last year. He was 
the lone junior on last season's Times' all-county first team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year he seems to add something to his game," said Orange Coach Eddie 
Carrillo, who saw George play a lot this summer. "He's a leader, he's a little 
tougher. He's the kind of guy who's going to carry that Santa Margarita team 
this year." GIRLS' SOCCER 
</P>
<P>
 Cassie Campbell, Marina 
</P>
<P>
 The Sunset League's most valuable player on offense as a junior, Cassie 
Campbell is great finisher. She scored 29 goals and had 14 assists, helping 
Marina win its second consecutive Southern Section Division I title and extend 
its unbeaten streak to 39 games. SOFTBALL 
</P>
<P>
 Marcy Crouch, Marina 
</P>
<P>
 Marcy Crouch is such a good soccer player that she starts playing softball 
much later in the season than others, but the enormousness of her talent is 
uncontested; she compiled a 22-2 record and 0.24 earned-run average, and batted 
.337 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 She led Marina's run to the Division I championship last year. BOYS' SWIMMING 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Kwok, Laguna Hills 
</P>
<P>
 With the departure of superstar Derya Buyukuncu from the county's prep pools, 
the scramble for No. 1 is on. Though there are plenty of state and nationally 
ranked swimmers, Laguna Hills' Mark Kwok, who also swims with the Mission Viejo 
Nadadores, is the leading candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Kwok swam a national time in the 100-yard butterfly (50.41 seconds). He was 
named swimmer of the meet at last season's Southern Section Division III 
finals. GIRLS' SWIMMING 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl Murphy, Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl Murphy is riding a wave of success at Mission Viejo. She finished third 
at the Southern Section Division I finals in the 100-yard backstroke after 
winning the event a week at the South Coast League finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Another member of the Nadadores, Murphy has senior-national times in the 
100-meter back and the 400-meter individual medley. At Nationals last month, 
she finished 23rd in the 200 backstroke in 2 minutes 19.26 seconds. BOYS' 
TENNIS 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Thompson, Foothill 
</P>
<P>
 With Ocean View's Jakub Pietrowski, twice The Times' player of the year, off 
to Notre Dame, things should get a little easier for county tennis players. 
Ryan Thompson, who was knocked out of the Southern Section singles tournament 
last year by Pietrowski in straight sets, appears to be the best of a talented 
senior class that includes Mater Dei's Brett Hankey and Villa Park's Ryan 
Hollis. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, from Foothill, is ranked 27th in Southern California in singles and 
is one of the top-ranked doubles players in the nation. GIRLS' TENNIS 
</P>
<P>
 Brandi Freudenberg, El Modena 
</P>
<P>
 El Modena's Brandi Freudenberg has been picked as The Times' best girls' 
player the last two seasons and there's no reason to expect she won't be again 
this year. Freudenberg, who reached the Southern Section individual singles 
semifinals last year, spent most of the summer honing her game and improving 
her ranking in national tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 She has decided to take recruiting trips to UCLA, Arizona, Baylor, Fresno 
State and California. BOYS' TRACK AND FIELD 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Curry, Tustin 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Curry has been Tustin's leading jumper the last two seasons, winning 
the Sea View League and Southern Section Division II triple jump titles as a 
junior. 
</P>
<P>
 He posted one of the nation's top marks (49 feet 8 1/2 inches, wind-aided) to 
win the county title last April. GIRLS' TRACK AND FIELD 
</P>
<P>
 Tara Oettinger, Foothill 
</P>
<P>
 Tara Oettinger was the State champion in the long jump last season with a 
personal best of 19 feet 7 1/2 inches, becoming the first individual State 
champion in the 30-year history of Foothill High. She won four events at the 
county championships and three at the Century League finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Oettinger had county-best marks in the 100 meters (12.37 seconds), 200 meters 
(25.17 seconds on three consecutive weekends) and 400 meters (57.72 at the 
county championships). BOYS' VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
<P>
 Gabe Gardner, San Clemente 
</P>
<P>
 Gabe Gardner, a 6-8 outside hitter, is also a standout water polo goalkeeper 
at San Clemente. His coach, USC alumnus Mike Hurlbut, said the Trojans and many 
of the nation's top programs are recruiting Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gabe isn't a fish out of water when he plays volleyball," Hurlbut said. "I 
think he'd like to play both sports in college." WATER POLO 
</P>
<P>
 James Palda, Corona del Mar 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar, top-ranked in the county and the Southern Section Division I, 
have four of the finest seniors, but James Palda stands out because of his 
intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Palda led the Sea Kings in scoring -- by a goal over fellow 
junior Neil Hueston -- helping Corona del Mar to the title game, where it lost 
to El Toro, 10-9, in overtime. WRESTLING 
</P>
<P>
 Josh Holiday, Calvary Chapel 
</P>
<P>
 Josh Holiday's 51-1 record last season included victories in the 145-pound 
weight class at league finals, Southern Section Division III, Masters and State 
tournaments, with his only loss coming at the Iron Man tournament in Ohio.

 Calvary Chapel Coach John Azevedo produces nationally ranked wrestlers with 
consistency, but Holiday has the desire, ability and discipline to be a 
standout in any program at any school.

PREP EXTRA; RAM MOVE MIGHT HURT MATER DEI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About the time Mater Dei's Rod Perry Jr. was sailing past a bewildered group 
of Servite defenders Friday night, it became clear what Baltimore city 
officials were working on. 
</P>
<P>
 They don't want the Rams. They want to underwrite high school football in 
their city. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, by taking the Rams, they have to endure mediocre, losing football. But, 
in exchange, they get Perry, a natural born thriller. 
</P>
<P>
 As the son of Ram assistant coach Rod Perry, he would change coasts. That 
would have to be part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, Georgia, you get tax incentives, a new stadium, and a key to the city -- 
not to mention one to the vault. We, as the residents of Baltimore, get an 
exciting player to watch, even if he is only 15.  
</P>
<P>
 They'll fill the new Camden Yards football stadium -- for the city high school 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The kid plays basketball and baseball with equal skill. More revenue. There's 
also an 8-year-old brother, Ryan, to consider and a sister on the way. This 
could be the greatest thing to hit Baltimore since Francis Scott Key. Better 
even. People have no trouble singing Perry's praise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just glad that the Rams had to honor their lease for another year," 
Mater Dei quarterback John Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Flynn is a senior. He'll be gone come the fall of 1995. Others, 
more permanent fixtures around Mater Dei, are a tad more concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 No sophomore in Orange County has more skill on the football field than Perry. 
He showed that Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 He caught four passes for 92 yards in a 55-14 rout. One was a 40-yard 
touchdown reception, where he glided past a couple nailed-to-the-ground Servite 
defenders. He also ran a reverse 20 yards for a touchdown. Again, he appeared 
to be the only one moving at full speed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, Perry was nervous before the game. But upcoming Monarch opponents 
probably were quivering afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry gained 135 all-purpose yards, a slow night for a guy who averaged four 
touchdowns a game on the freshman team last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry's first high school play was a clue. Playing quarterback, he went to 
hand off to the fullback but found no fullback there. Oh well. Perry just kept 
the ball and went around end for 65 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine how pleased Monarch coaches must have been. Perry said he didn't even 
think about attending Mater Dei until a month before school began. His family 
had only arrived from Seattle three years ago, when Rod Sr. followed Ram Coach 
Chuck Knox south. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, Mater Dei caught a break. But Monarch opponents didn't, not as 
last season wore on. Perry played quarterback, running back, wide receiver and 
defensive back -- scoring at least one touchdown at each position. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly some Baltimore high school could use that? Monarch Coach Bruce 
Rollinson certainly can. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollinson will plead that the kid is only a sophomore but also drool over his 
abilities. You can't blame him. It's hard to keep up the 
he-needs-a-little-more-experience act. Not the way people are talking. Like a 
fish story, Perry's catches keep getting bigger. 
</P>
<P>
 "He tipped the ball over the defensive back's head with one hand, then caught 
it with the other hand."  
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, things look bright for Perry and even brighter for Mater Dei, as long as 
he sticks around. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, maybe something can be worked out. Maybe this is the best chance for 
keeping the Rams in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a lot of clout in that Mater Dei family, after all. And with that 
football budget, maybe they can underwrite the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 If not, there's always Plan B. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rollinson: "I may adopt a son."

 Misty May doesn't have to talk a good game. Everyone else does it for her. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Said Rocky Ciarelli, Huntington Beach girls' volleyball coach: "From her 
ball control, to hitting, to setting, she does everything well and she knows 
the game better than any high school player now, guy or girl." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Said Charlie Brande, Orange County Volleyball Club coach: "Misty should be 
labeled with the best ever in the county . . . she could be the greatest ever 
from Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Said Sara Fairborn, Newport Harbor player: "When it's tough and most 
players will get frightened or scared, Misty will step up and make three great 
plays in a row." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Said Mike Hurlbut, Dana Hills coach: "I wouldn't be surprised if Misty was 
wearing an Olympic gold medal in 1996." 
</P>
<P>
 But May's exceptional talent also breeds great expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people expect too much," said May, a 5-foot-9 senior from Newport 
Harbor. "Then sometimes, they'll get mad or angry if I'm not able to do it. 
Maybe that's a little unfair, but I try not to let it bother me." 
</P>
<P>
 But on the surface, bothersome events have dotted her high school career. 
</P>
<P>
 During last year's State championship match, May was briefly benched for 
disciplinary reasons by Newport Harbor Coach Dan Glenn. The Sailors lost in 
five games to rival Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 Although May finished second in the high jump at the State track and field 
meet as a sophomore last season, she was kicked off the team after a dispute 
with Newport Harbor coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last eight years, May has found it difficult to find a comfortable club 
volleyball environment, playing with five teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything she does is made a big deal because it's Misty May," Glenn said. 
"But every high school kid makes mistakes and they're supposed to do that. 
They're growing. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it doesn't matter what outsiders think. My team is the most important 
thing. Misty and I get along fine and she has always played hard for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Albert Gasparian, Golden West College women's volleyball coach: "Because 
of Misty's talent level, things get blown way out of proportion. Let's face it, 
she's a 17-year-old kid, and a kid will be a kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Misty May was a 5-year-old kid when she started playing volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was when I first started bumping the ball around," May said. "I think I 
was 7 when I entered my first beach tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, Butch, wasn't a bad guy to learn from. 
</P>
<P>
 Butch May, who played for the U.S. team at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, 
also enjoyed a successful beach volleyball career. 
</P>
<P>
 Misty's mother, Barbara, also came from a family rich with athletic talent. 
Misty's aunt Bettyann Dent, her uncle Phil Dent, and her cousin Brett Hansen, 
all played professional tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family pushed me into tennis," Barbara May said. "But we let Misty try 
everything. She liked soccer and a lot of other sports too, but I guess she 
really liked the challenge of volleyball." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mays also search for ways to continually challenge their daughter -- 
scholastically and athletically. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish she'd push herself more in the classroom," Barbara May said. "She's a 
B student, but I'd like to see her be an A student like I was." 
</P>
<P>
 But the parents' input into Misty's athletic career has ruffled more than a 
few feathers in the Orange County coaching community. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're considered rebels because we ask questions, that's fine," Butch May 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe they see us as a threat because we're knowledgeable about the sport," 
Barbara May said. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest clash at Newport Harbor came over Misty May's status with the 
track and field team. Although she did well in the high jump as a sophomore, 
she was struggling as a junior, which prompted her father to seek outside help. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went to the Riverside Track Club, and there, Misty learned more about high 
jumping in three hours than she did in three years at Newport Harbor," Butch 
May said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Eric Tweit, Newport Harbor Athletic Director and track and field coach: 
"Basically, Misty decided not to attend our practices. They wanted to go to 
their own high jump coach, and I said they could do that on their own time. 
</P>
<P>
 "But she had to be at our practices. At Newport Harbor, we feel the athletes 
have a certain obligation and commitment, and we expect them to fulfill that." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Butch May: "It might have been workable to do both, but we chose to go to 
Riverside." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Barbara May: "I guess you can say we have a difference in philosophy with 
the coaches at Newport Harbor." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Glenn has heard the scuttlebutt, and for three years, he has heard the 
criticisms of his coaching ability. But they don't bother him. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn plays May at outside hitter, although he knows May could develop into a 
national-team level setter. That's one reason why May has made an oral 
commitment to Long Beach State, where former 1984 U.S. Olympic team setter, 
Debbie Green, is an assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say May is ready to set now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Already, with the proper training, she could step in right now and be a 
Division I setter," said Lance Stewart, Corona del Mar's coach. "She's a very 
smart player and she has the tools." 
</P>
<P>
 But Glenn has other concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Misty is just one of 13 players on this team and I have to do what's best for 
everyone," Glenn said. "I treat everyone equally and I feel I'm fair. I think 
Misty's my best player, and when she's a hitter, she can touch the ball twice 
-- passing, then hitting." 
</P>
<P>
 Ciarelli said: "Danny already has a setter (Jenny Hecker) so Misty's a perfect 
choice on the outside. I think Misty could either set or hit in college. Heck, 
now you could put her back there by herself and she would get the ball back." 
</P>
<P>
 A comeback during last season's State championship match was on May's mind 
when her brief outburst occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "The match was tight and she started yelling at her teammates, then she 
snapped and shouted at me," Glenn said. "I don't even know what she said, but I 
just subbed her out and she quietly went to the end of the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a few points, Misty came back to me and said, 'Sorry coach, I got 
really frustrated,' so I just told her, 'OK, but remember, you can't lose your 
cool like that out there.' "I just subbed her back in and that was the end of 
it. I don't dwell on the past and it wasn't a big deal, really." 
</P>
<P>
 Others made a big deal about it. Can Dan Glenn and Misty May get along? Can 
they win the big game? 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything Misty does gets examined too closely," said Gasparian, who has led 
Golden West to community college women's volleyball State championships in four 
of the last six seasons.  
</P>
<P>
 "Fans should just appreciate the type of player she is, and she looks pretty 
good to me. As for not winning the big one, there is a certain element of luck 
involved to win anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Corona del Mar won the Southern Section and State Division I 
championship for the second consecutive year, defeating the Sailors in the 
section and State finals in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Misty May will never win a championship by herself," Stewart said. "I felt we 
were a better team and we played better at the right time during the 
championship. It wasn't a case that Misty didn't play well or she couldn't win 
in the big match." 
</P>
<P>
 Winning and competing in volleyball is important to Misty May, but she 
admitted there are times when she doesn't enjoy the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always tell myself every summer that I'm going to take a break, just to get 
away from it," she said. "But I just end up playing somewhere. I like it too 
much." 
</P>
<P>
 She likes it so much that last season she played through injuries in the 
playoffs, helping the Sailors reach the section and State finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a gamer," Glenn said. "She played hurt down the stretch but she 
wouldn't quit." 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of all the ruckus is Misty. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will just come up to me and say, 'So you're the best player?' " May 
said. "I just say 'I don't know, go ask so and so.' That's just not me. I'm 
very quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, some of the times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, Misty's a clown," said Fairborn, her teammate. "She will crack up 
tons of people. But our whole team is goofy in its own sort of way." 
</P>
<P>
 May said she's a big Jim Carrey fan and dreams about being a TV star with the 
cast from "In Living Color." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's Misty, and there is this other person who makes people laugh," May 
said. "When I first meet people, I like to do something weird and make them 
think, 'Wow, she's really out there.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Especially on the volleyball court. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, May was the youngest player to participate in women's volleyball at 
the Olympic Festival in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, they weren't going to let me try out because you were supposed to 
be a senior in high school," May said. "But my dad called (U.S. women's 
national team Coach) Terry Liskevych and I got a tryout. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I thought they weren't going to take me because it was all politics, but 
my dad said just try. After practice, I earned some of the players' respect 
because I showed that I could pull my own weight." 
</P>
<P>
 May did more than that, earning a starting spot on the West squad early in the 
tournament, then she helped the team finish second. 
</P>
<P>
 But excelling in volleyball has always been second nature to May. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of my first memories of playing with Misty was when she was 8," Butch May 
said. "She was copping an attitude with me when we were playing in a mixed 
tournament. She kept getting upset, 'Dad, you're not putting the ball away.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, she was right. She was doing all the right things, setting the ball to 
the right places, but we lost." 
</P>
<P>
 As a freshman for Newport Harbor, May started on a senior dominated team as 
their setter. In her sophomore year, one Pac-10 coach said he would have taken 
her right then to play at the collegiate level. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to notice someone who can hammer the ball, and Misty can get up and 
hit it with anybody," Stewart said. "But her defense and passing are 
incredible. She covers so much court . . . she scores more points for them with 
things outside of hitting." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Brande: "She's like a female Karch Kiraly." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Glenn: "She's golden." 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who haven't seen Misty May know all about her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on the numbers I've seen and people I've talked to, she definitely has 
a bright future," Liskevych said. "Although she's a sight-unseen for me, I 
would still love to invite her to San Diego for tryouts so we could get a look 
at her." 
</P>
<P>
 And from the looks of things, this 17-year-old kid will be just fine.

<P>
 The Really Bad Idea Dept. kicks off this season with a fumble by Foothill 
Coach Tom Meiss. 
</P>
<P>
 After his football team beat Tustin, 40-6, on Friday to stop a five-year 
losing streak against the Tillers, Meiss announced he wanted to end the annual 
rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
 Meiss, in his third year, would like to do away with a tradition that dates 
back 29 years and 28 games; they didn't meet in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to end this game three years ago because there's nothing good about 
it," Meiss said. "It's not healthy for anybody. I felt like I could not end it 
on a sour note. If you lose (and want out), it looks like you're ducking out of 
it. I'll do anything I can to see that it doesn't continue." 
</P>
<P>
 It appears Meiss is ducking out, period. Foothill is 17-9-2 in the series, 
even though it had not won since 1988 (four were shutouts). The game typically 
is the season-opener and provides a good motivational tool to keep both teams 
focused during summer two-a-days. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can't, it's not going to be the end of the world because our program is 
on the rise, regardless of whether I'm there or someone else is there," Meiss 
said. "It doesn't change the fact that it's not a healthy situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I have people talking trash and (such) in today's society, it promotes 
all the things that I'm against. I resent it when Tustin uses its T-shirts to 
belittle us. I'm into a more healthy relationship. It should just be a game and 
the kids should enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
 One wonders, would Mater Dei and Servite, which now has lost six in a row to 
the Monarchs, stop playing? Or Fullerton-Anaheim? Or Westminster-La Quinta? 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin and Foothill have a contract to play each other next year, then it 
expires. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would probably become a very political issue," said Foothill Athletic 
Director Bob Osborne, who helps make the schedule. "I think as long as we can 
keep it a healthy rivalry, and there aren't too many incidents, we can keep 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Second-year Tustin Coach Tim Ellis can see Meiss' point that players put too 
much stock in the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't look at it as a bad thing," he said. "Some egos are hurt, but nobody 
got hurt. The stands are packed and there's excitement; that's what's neat 
about this game -- the community gets behind it." 
</P>
<P>
 And the community -- and the schools -- will be around long after Meiss 
departs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of rivalries, Mater Dei quarterback John Flynn couldn't wait to get 
home after the Monarchs' victory over Servite. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother went to Servite," Flynn said. "As soon as I get home, I'm calling 
him. This is going to be fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei beat the Friars, 55-14. Flynn completed 15 of 19 passes for 250 
yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>

 Costa Mesa's DeWayne Crenshaw scored on his first carry against Ocean View, 
going 70 yards for a touchdown. A year earlier, he scored on his first carry 
against Ocean View, going 44 yards. Crenshaw had five touchdowns Friday, but it 
wasn't a school record -- Binh Tran had six last year. And Crenshaw didn't even 
score the most touchdowns of the night -- Laguna Hills' Brendan McGraw had six 
against Sonora. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw wasn't the only player to score on his team's first play from 
scrimmage on the first night of the season: 
</P>
<P>
 * Irvine's Sean Clark ran 22 yards for a touchdown the first time the Vaqueros 
got the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sonora's Mark Gonzales scored on an 80-yard pass play from Kevin Rodriguez 
to open its 48-26 loss to Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tustin's Reggie Curry scored on an 80-yard pass play from Kevin Timone on 
the first play of its 40-6 loss to Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of those guys could beat Trabuco Hills' Keith Hocking into the end 
zone. He took the opening kickoff Thursday and returned it 99 yards for the 
season's first score.

 When Elden Gillespie donated the Mayor's Trophy in 1982 to encourage 
Westminster and La Quinta to play football against each other, some feared the 
size disparity in the schools would create mismatches such as Thursday's 42-0 
Westminster victory. It hasn't happened. In the eight meetings before 1994, six 
games were decided by eight points or fewer; four were decided by no more than 
a field goal. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Best injury story of the week belongs to Santa Margarita lineman Josh Beckett. 
He left the game against Trabuco Hills in the first half, fearing he had a 
broken bone in his leg. He got in a car to go to the hospital, but the car 
wouldn't start. "Screw this," Beckett said, "I'm going back." 
</P>
<P>
 He played the second half -- with a bone chip in his ankle.

 Foothill's water polo team, ranked No. 4 in the county preseason coaches poll, 
will quickly find out how well it measures up. The Knights start their season 
today against No. 2 San Clemente and play No. 1 Corona del Mar on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's game, at 6 p.m. at Tustin High, also will mark the high school debut 
for freshman Robby Arroyo, brother of Gavin Arroyo, a former Villa Park 
standout and current member of the U.S. national team. Foothill Coach Jim Brumm 
says Arroyo will start. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has so much speed I can't see how we could not start him," Brumm said. 
"And he's only going to get better."

 The county's best volleyball teams will play Friday and Saturday in the 
two-day Orange County Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to top-seeded Newport Harbor, fans can watch Corona del Mar, Dana 
Hills, Calvary Chapel, Capistrano Valley, Mater Dei and Huntington Beach. The 
finals are scheduled for 4 p.m. Saturday at Edison High.

OFFICIALS ATTACK MTA HANDLING OF SUBWAY JOB; METRO RAIL: THEY CITE RECENT 
TUNNEL PROBLEMS AS INDICATIONS OF MISMANAGEMENT. THE AGENCY'S DIRECTOR SAYS HE 
IS TRYING TO REORGANIZE THE WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Elected officials called Monday for the top executive of the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority to act swiftly to rectify what they described as the 
agency's mismanaged subway construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The comments came in response to a Times article reporting that MTA engineers 
delayed enforcing a contract specification aimed at preventing the type of 
ground sinkage now plaguing Vermont Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "This goes beyond the normal difficulty that a construction project of this 
magnitude should have," said Los Angeles Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who urged 
MTA Chief Executive Officer Franklin E. White to address what he called "a 
systemic problem with the construction process." 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Patsaouras, an appointee to the MTA board, said that "Frank White now has 
to work through the smoke and mirrors . . . and take action. It's at his 
doorstep." 
</P>
<P>
 White said he is attempting to win the support of MTA board members for a 
proposal he first made last spring, to "fully integrate" within the parent 
transit agency the inspection, design and cost-control responsibilities of the 
existing Rail Construction Corp. The RCC is a subagency of the transit 
authority whose staff oversees many aspects of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 White also said he will withhold judgment about the problems along Hollywood 
Boulevard until the president of the RCC submits a report on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, who represents the areas affected by the 
tunneling, said she and her constituents have lost confidence in MTA officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am horrified -- furious beyond anything that I can describe," Goldberg 
said. "They (MTA officials) never mentioned to me that they weren't doing the 
grouting. Now the question is: Can we believe them about anything?" 
</P>
<P>
 The construction procedure Goldberg referred to is "contact grouting," whereby 
workers pump grout into the soil from within each freshly dug, circular section 
of tunneling within 16 hours of each short advancement of a tunnel-boring 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel J. Sandberg, the MTA's project manager for the 12 miles of twin tunnels 
that will connect Hollywood to Wilshire Boulevard, said officials delayed 
enforcing a contract specification requiring contact grouting because he wanted 
to save taxpayers money. He said he had hoped that other procedures would 
adequately stabilize the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times also reported Sunday that in early August -- five months after the 
MTA had finally ordered the builder of the tunnels to perform the contact 
grouting -- a span longer than a football field was excavated without it. 
Inspection "nonconformance" reports show that the area where the contact 
grouting was not performed within the required 16 hours of excavation was 
beneath the intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and Whitley Avenue, which is in 
the area that sank. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers, including representatives of the Federal Transportation 
Administration, are investigating what caused the ground to settle over nine 
blocks, from roughly Vine Street to Highland Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The article also reported that Sandberg and the project's top tunnel designer 
-- after learning in late July and early August that Hollywood Boulevard had 
already sunk by four inches -- decided against a separate "compaction grouting" 
procedure. Some engineers believe that this process, which involves injecting 
grout from the surface level, could have minimized more dramatic settlement on 
the boulevard when a second tunnel-boring machine progressed through. 
</P>
<P>
 When that second machine passed, the ground sank an additional five inches, 
leading to a shutdown of all tunneling Aug. 18 and a closure of the nine blocks 
of the boulevard to car traffic. A number of water and sewer lines also have 
ruptured. The tunnel designer, Timothy P. Smirnoff, had told a meeting of 
Hollywood residents convened by Councilwoman Goldberg on Aug. 17 that 
compaction grouting "historically does not limit or change the amount of 
settlement (of) the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 But the tunnel contractor, Shea-Kiewit-Kenny, was ordered by Metro Rail 
officials last October to perform compaction grouting "to arrest this continued 
settlement" along Vermont Avenue, where sinkage of four inches had been found. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg said she was angered, in part, because despite requesting "all the 
bad news" from project officials, she was never informed of ground sinkage on 
Vermont Avenue. Had she known at the Aug. 17 meeting that compaction grouting 
was used earlier to counter the settling, she said, she would have been better 
positioned to demand similar preventive measures on Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had known that," Goldberg said, "then they wouldn't have gotten away 
with" stating that such grouting of Hollywood Boulevard was unnecessary. 
Smirnoff did not return calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA rail construction President Edward McSpedon -- asked Monday if he now 
thinks the decision to not order compaction grouting on Hollywood Boulevard was 
a sound one -- said, "I'm thinking about it." McSpedon's engineering 
consultants have said they had hoped that other tunneling techniques would 
adequately stabilize the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvatore J. Calvanico, resident engineer of the project for the MTA's 
management firm, Parsons-Dillingham, said in an interview last week that he and 
his colleagues did not have the luxury of hindsight when weighing whether to 
order compaction grouting. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Polanco, who last month called for an outside review of 
the Hollywood Boulevard problems by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, said the 
grouting controversy is causing him to redouble his efforts. "It's clear to me 
that they're (Metro Rail officials) experimenting, that Hollywood Boulevard has 
been made a guinea pig," said Polanco, who represents the area.  
</P>
<P>
 The chairman of the Rail Construction Corp., the agency whose board would be 
dissolved under White's proposal, praised project engineers Monday and 
suggested that others did not understand the construction process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I for one experience with you the frustration of seeing what is in the public 
sector, compared to what the professional people that work in this industry 
really know what is happening," said Robert E. Kruse, who is an engineer.

DREAM TEAM; PUBLIC SERVICE: THE THREAD UNITING NEARLY 1,000 SOUTHLAND 
VOLUNTEERS SWORN IN TO AMERICORPS IS IDEALISM AND THE BELIEF THEY CAN CHANGE 
THINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With an economics degree from UCLA and a resume laced with honors, 22-year-old 
Anna Ouroumian figures she could easily command a higher salary, complete with 
impressive business cards and a lofty title. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the young Glendale woman is content to spend this year working with a 
local anti-hunger project, earning a modest income. 
</P>
<P>
 Her co-workers will be people such as Garland Robinson of South Los Angeles, 
who temporarily put off a master's degree to fulfill a lifelong dream of 
"working with the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with thousands of others across the country, Ouroumian and Robinson have 
signed up for a "season of service" in AmeriCorps, President Clinton's national 
service program. On Monday, the two gathered with nearly 1,000 other 
participants at the Universal Amphitheatre for the mass swearing-in of the 
nation's first AmeriCorps class. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, the one thread uniting an otherwise disparate group of 
AmeriCorps members -- young and old, middle-class and poor -- is an idealism 
reminiscent of a bygone era in American history: the belief that they can be 
the agents of change. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a domestic Peace Corps, the AmeriCorps members will combat problems 
ranging from hunger and crime to illiteracy and pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm interested in community empowerment and . . . showing people that things 
can be done," said Ouroumian, who grew up in Glendale. "I know it sounds 
cliche-ish, but I believe anything is possible." 
</P>
<P>
 At the ceremony, AmeriCorps members listened to a string of speeches -- laced 
with words of encouragement and praise -- by Mayor Richard Riordan, Police 
Chief Willie L. Williams and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Henry 
Cisneros, as well as past and present members of other service organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "AmeriCorps will rise or fall with your success this year," Cisneros said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking via satellite in a speech that was simulcast to AmeriCorps members 
nationwide, Clinton applauded members for their commitment to changing America 
and "getting things done." 
</P>
<P>
 "Every generation in our history has learned to take responsibility for our 
future, and your generation is no exception," Clinton said. "We look at you 
now, and we know you are no generation of slackers. Instead, you're a 
generation of doers." 
</P>
<P>
 For all its seriousness, the event -- hosted by actor Andrew Shue, a star of 
the "Melrose Place" television series -- felt like a pep rally at times, with 
members breaking out in impromptu chants ("We want Bill!") and songs ("Lean on 
Me") while waiting for the satellite hookup. 
</P>
<P>
 Performers Patti LaBelle, who donned a black AmeriCorps cap, and the R&B group 
Immature brought the crowd to its feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like what you're doing," LaBelle said as the crowd cheered wildly. "Keep on 
striving for the positive things in life." 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece of the event was the pledge that all AmeriCorps members took. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing in front of a screen, right hands held high, they listened to the 
words spoken by Clinton, then repeated them: 
</P>
<P>
 "I will get things done for America to make our people safer, smarter and 
healthier. I will bring Americans together, to strengthen our communities. 
Faced with apathy, I will take action. Faced with conflict, I will seek common 
ground. Faced with adversity, I will persevere. . . . " In return for their 
pledge, they will receive a living stipend -- often minimum wage, though some 
team leaders will make up to $1,200 a month -- along with basic health 
insurance, a child-care allowance and a monetary award for college, vocational 
training or to pay off a previous educational loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Trial runs of the program this summer have received mixed reviews, and 
participants say they know the work will be difficult, especially for the pay 
they will receive. But for some, at least, the compensation is secondary to the 
life-changing experiences they expect to have during their year of service. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, for instance, sees his year as a way to help and to lay the 
foundation for a career in social work. 
</P>
<P>
 But with a degree in political science from USC, and no experience, he could 
not find anyone to hire him. "I asked, 'How can I get the training if I'm not 
given a chance?' " he said. "I just wanted the chance to prove myself." 
</P>
<P>
 A self-proclaimed "product of the '60s," Robinson grew up on 27th Street 
between Central Avenue and Naomi Street and remembers "a brighter time in Los 
Angeles," when people knew and cared for each other, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, 44, has reason to believe in the possibility of change. In May he 
became the only one of his parents' seven children to graduate from college. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a story to tell because I've been there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Robinson, who was active in student government and other organizations, 
many AmeriCorps members are no strangers to community work. 
</P>
<P>
 Ouroumian, who graduated magna cum laude from UCLA in June, spent her extra 
time outside the classroom planting trees at the Nickerson Gardens housing 
project, promoting environmental awareness, helping with earthquake relief and 
working with a number of service organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, she spent her summer break working with residents of the Pico-Union 
area, organizing community members in Summer of Service, the pilot program for 
AmeriCorps. 
</P>
<P>
 AmeriCorps is open to anyone over 17, including high school dropouts, college 
graduates, students and professional school graduates. Thus the program 
attracts individuals from varying backgrounds -- some of whom might have been 
overlooked by other employers. 
</P>
<P>
 Before coming to this country four years ago, Mayra Perez volunteered with the 
American Red Cross, assisting the victims of war in her native El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A clerk at a shoe store, she is studying for her high-school equivalency 
degree and will spend her AmeriCorps year working with an anti-hunger project. 
</P>
<P>
 David Guizar, 21, was once in a gang and lost a brother in a gang killing. He 
will spend a year working in his neighborhood in South Los Angeles, trying to 
help the kinds of young people he once fought with and against. 
</P>
<P>
 "I finally got my chance," Guizar said. "This is my first job. I'm part of 
staff. It feels pretty good, you know?" 
</P>
<P>
 Guizar will be working in the same program as Aqeela Sherrills, 25. When a 
fire at Jordan Downs housing projects sparked racial tension three years ago, 
Sherrills, a resident of Watts, stepped in and served as a mediator. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherrills will spend a year with Building Up Los Angeles, where he will work 
to establish tutoring programs, a public safety project, gang prevention and 
conflict mediation in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning next week, 40 AmeriCorps workers -- including Ouroumian, Robinson 
and Perez -- will be added to the Interfaith Hunger Coalition, which 
administers anti-hunger programs in the region. Its annual budget of $320,000 
will increase to more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest assets AmeriCorps members will bring with them is 
familiarity with their communities, organizers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Along those lines, Robinson said he will offer a basic message to the people 
he works with: 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand and I am one of you," he said. "I'm just a regular person who 
cares and wants to help."

CLASSES RESUME AT 200 SCHOOLS; TEACHERS STUDY CONTRACT OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reminders of the Northridge earthquake were not hard to find Monday as classes 
resumed at about 200 campuses in the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cleveland High School in Reseda, students snaked their way through four 
lines to buy lunch outside the cafeteria, still closed by quake damage. At 
Fulton Middle School in Van Nuys, teachers met in daylong planning sessions in 
classrooms with missing ceiling tiles and patched walls. 
</P>
<P>
 At Reseda High School, students took a dance class outside on the asphalt near 
the empty, quake-damaged gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing the best we can," said Bob Kladifko, the principal at Reseda 
High, where the gym, auditorium and a 10-classroom building remain closed. 
"We're just trying to keep an optimistic outlook." 
</P>
<P>
 While new students searched for classrooms and familiar faces, teachers 
throughout the district held lunchtime and after-school meetings Monday to 
learn more about their new contract offer. About 28,000 members of United 
Teachers Los Angeles are eligible to vote today and Wednesday on whether to 
accept the school district's 8% pay restoration or to authorize a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders have recommended that teachers accept the contract offer, which 
is intended to restore most of the 10% pay cut that teachers accepted two years 
ago. Union leaders predicted that the district will be spared a strike; results 
of the vote will be made public Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are not jumping for joy, but they're happier than they were two years 
ago," said Catherine Carey, the union spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Allie Landers, the union representative at Carver Middle School in 
South-Central Los Angeles: "For the most part, I think teachers agreed this is 
the best we can get right now. They are reluctant to accept anything less than 
10%, but a strike is not what we want at this time either." 
</P>
<P>
 But some campus union leaders said the offer was a hard sell to their 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we had to compromise, but teachers are not 100% or even 80% 
enthusiastic about accepting it," said Lannie Foster, a teacher and union 
representative at Jordan High School in Watts. "But overall, we want to do 
what's best for children and no one wants to disrupt their education." 
</P>
<P>
 While hundreds of thousands of students showed up for the first day of school 
Monday, administrators said enrollments were lower than expected across the 
district. But they also said that higher absenteeism is usual during the first 
couple of weeks of class. 
</P>
<P>
 At Canoga Park High, for example, about 1,300 students attended classes Monday 
-- about 200 fewer than expected. Reseda High had some 1,500 pupils -- about 
500 fewer than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 In unusual and confusing scheduling this year, most schools will be closed on 
Thursday -- the Yom Kippur holiday, which typically is met with high 
absenteeism, officials said. Most of those on year-round class schedules will 
remain open however. "Wherever we could close schools and avoid the 
absenteeism, we did," said Bill Rivera, the district's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's transportation system had opening-day problems, with students 
in some schools waiting in the wrong place for buses and others missing their 
rides altogether. District officials said bus stops and routes will be ironed 
out over the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cleveland High, students were upset that their cafeteria remained closed 
and surrounded by a chain link fence because of quake damage. "We don't have 
our area where we used to hang out," said sophomore Maria Andrade, 16. "We 
don't have any place to go."

RESEARCH SHOWS 1ST LINK BETWEEN AGE, CANCER RISK; MEDICINE: A USC STUDY PROVES 
A LONG-HELD BELIEF IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY THAT GENETIC MUTATIONS INCREASE 
AS PEOPLE GROW OLDER, RAISING THE POTENTIAL FOR MALIGNANCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A USC researcher has provided the first direct evidence that cancer-causing 
mutations of genes accumulate with age, thereby raising the risk of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an article of faith for many researchers that these mutations, caused by 
a breakdown of the body's normal repair mechanisms, are responsible for the 
high incidence of cancer among the elderly. But until now, there has been 
little experimental support for the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Using new genetic engineering technology, however, molecular pharmacologist 
Gino Cortopassi of USC has studied the incidence of a specific mutation in a 
gene called BCL2, which plays a major role in the development of non-Hodgkin's 
lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph nodes that strikes 45,000 Americans each year, 
killing about 21,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Cortopassi and his colleagues report today in the Proceedings of the National 
Academy of Sciences that the incidence of mutations is 40 times as high in 
spleen tissue from people over age 60 as it is in people under 20.  
</P>
<P>
 Significantly, the risk of developing lymphoma is also 40 times as high in 
people over age 60 as it is in people under 20. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate study, Cortopassi has also found a two- to three-fold increase 
in the incidence of BCL2 mutations among smokers and a corresponding increase 
in the risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.  
</P>
<P>
 The finding provides new impetus for researchers who are trying to reduce the 
risk of cancer by finding ways to block the mutations, such as by the use of 
antioxidants like Vitamins C and E. 
</P>
<P>
 The study "may also provide valuable insights into the cause of non-Hodgkin's 
lymphoma," which has a yearly rate of increase exceeded only by lung cancer in 
women and melanoma in both men and women, according to Dr. Nathaniel Rothman of 
the National Cancer Institute. "It's increasing and we don't know why," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has increased by more than 65% since 
the early 1970s, according to the American Cancer Society. Part of the increase 
is a result of the above-normal incidence of lymphoma among AIDS patients, but 
the mysterious majority of it is apparently unrelated to that epidemic. "It's 
an important public health issue," Rothman said, "and this is an exciting 
finding." 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers have long known that the incidence of cancer increases with age. 
While one of every 60 men under the age of 40 develop cancer, fully one of 
every three between the ages of 60 and 79 do so. For women, the corresponding 
figures are one of 52 and one of four. 
</P>
<P>
 Most researchers believe that this increase results from the slow but steady 
accumulation of genetic defects caused by exposure to chemicals in the 
environment, radiation and viruses. As it ages, the body loses the ability to 
repair those defects. 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of scientists have previously been able to demonstrate the 
accumulation of such defects in body cells, but those studies have focused on 
defects that play no role in cancer formation. 
</P>
<P>
 Cortopassi chose to look at BCL2 because it plays a clear role in triggering 
lymphoma and because it contains what researchers call a genetic "hot spot," an 
area particularly prone to mutations. The gene controls a process called 
apoptosis, which directs cells to commit suicide after they have been damaged, 
genetically or otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 When BCL2 itself is damaged, the cell survives while genetic defects 
accumulate. Over time, enough damage can accumulate to trigger cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Cortopassi collected blood samples from 53 living people and from 31 autopsies 
conducted at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. Using a technology called 
polymerase chain reaction -- the same PCR technology used to perform DNA 
fingerprinting in the O.J. Simpson case -- he measured the number of genetic 
defects, called translocations, at the "hot spot" in both blood cells and 
spleen tissue. 
</P>
<P>
 He found 13 times as many translocations in blood cells from 60-year-olds as 
from 20-year-olds and 40 times as many in spleen tissues. 
</P>
<P>
 Cortopassi conceded that his results do not prove that the mutations cause 
cancer. That will require a second step in which researchers identify the 
number of mutations in the blood of individuals and then monitor them to 
determine whether those with the most mutations are most likely to develop 
cancer. That study is now in progress, he said.

EMERGENCY REDEVELOPMENT AREAS PROPOSED; RECOVERY: SPECIAL PROVISIONS OF STATE 
LAW ALLOW LOCAL AGENCIES TO DESIGNATE NEIGHBORHOODS WITHOUT FINISHING LENGTHY 
ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES. SIX VALLEY AND HOLLYWOOD ZONES ARE TARGETED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the latest effort to hasten the city's quake recovery, Los Angeles 
redevelopment officials recommended Monday establishing emergency redevelopment 
areas in six quake-ravaged areas in the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, the proposed areas are scattered around the damaged neighborhoods, 
reflecting the meandering nature of the quake's destruction, with the biggest 
areas near the epicenter in Northridge, Chatsworth, North Hills and Granada 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal would take advantage of emergency provisions of the state's 
redevelopment law that allow local agencies to establish project areas in 
disaster zones without completing the time-consuming environmental studies 
required when traditional redevelopment areas are established. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, local redevelopment agencies can keep all the property tax 
generated by new construction in a project area and use that money to pay for 
improvements, such as new streets, parks and sewers, as well as loans for quake 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city has rushed to establish the project areas to meet the 
state's emergency guidelines, the city's Community Redevelopment Agency delayed 
until Friday a vote to launch the proposal because some agency members said 
they needed more time to study the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a decision being asked for, in my opinion, in an outrageous manner," 
said CRA member Bobbi Fiedler, who complained that she received a copy of the 
proposal report just before Monday's CRA meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 At the meeting, redevelopment officials asked the CRA for authority to begin a 
60-day investigation to assess the damage in the so-called "study areas" and 
craft quake recovery strategies for each area. 
</P>
<P>
 The final decision on whether to establish the project areas would be made at 
a joint meeting of the City Council and the CRA following that 60-day period. 
</P>
<P>
 The CRA's decision Monday to further delay launching the program prompted a 
warning from CRA staff and city attorneys that the city may jeopardize the 
effort if the approval process is delayed past Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The city must establish the zones soon if it intends to characterize them as 
emergency areas, said Deputy City Atty. Marcia Gonzales-Kimbrough. Otherwise, 
she said, the emergency provision could be challenged in court. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no deadline for establishing a project area, but she said cities in 
Northern California have established emergency areas within nine months of such 
disasters as the Loma Prieta quake and the Oakland fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason the CRA is under the gun, Gonzales-Kimbrough said is that 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky has insisted on voting for the proposal before he 
leaves office Dec. 2 to begin his term as a county supervisor. One of the 
proposed redevelopment areas is in Yaroslavsky's district along Ventura 
Boulevard and in other major commercial zones in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (delay) pushes us closer and closer to our deadline," said Yaroslavsky 
aide Vivian Rescalvo. 
</P>
<P>
 Other proposed redevelopment areas are located: 
</P>
<P>
 * In the west San Fernando Valley, where an area is proposed generally along 
Sherman Way, Reseda Boulevard, Canoga Avenue and Topanga Canyon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Hollywood, where areas would be established around Hollywood Boulevard 
near North Vermont Avenue and near the intersection of Beverly Boulevard and 
New Hampshire Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the northeast Valley, where an area would be spread throughout commercial 
and residential areas in Mission Hills, Pacoima and Sylmar. Another area would 
be established in North Hollywood along Laurel Canyon, Burbank, Victory and 
Lankershim boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 Existing traditional redevelopment areas in Hollywood, North Hollywood and 
Downtown have been plagued by controversy, particularly regarding the CRA's 
power to condemn and take over private property. 
</P>
<P>
 To quell similar fears about the quake redevelopment areas, city officials 
have met with residents and business owners in the proposed areas to assure 
them that condemnation powers will be used only in extreme cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Reactions have so far been cautiously optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 William Powers, president of the Chatsworth Chamber of Commerce said he fully 
supports the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chamber loves it," he said. "We look upon this as an opportunity for the 
city to come back -- and come back stronger than ever before." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Tom Hilborn, president of the Reseda Chamber of Commerce, said he 
needs to study the plan further before giving it his complete support. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are investigating it," he said. "But it seems on the surface to be very 
good."

COMMUNITY WORK REQUIRED AT CHATSWORTH HIGH; SERVICE: THE SCHOOL BECOMES THE 
FIRST IN THE COUNTY TO MAKE 20 HOURS OF VOLUNTEER ACTIVITY A PREREQUISITE TO 
GRADUATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Beginning this semester, Chatsworth High School students are required to do 
community service work to earn their diplomas, making the school the first in 
Los Angeles County to adopt such a graduation requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Every student now in grades nine, 10 and 11 must complete 20 hours of 
community service by the time they finish high school, or face the possibility 
of not graduating. This year's senior class will have to perform only 10 hours 
of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the school tested the program on its senior class, with 90% of the 
students participating in projects ranging from volunteer work with local 
politicians to planting trees at the new Metrolink station in Chatsworth.  
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the requirement stems from the School Based Management Plan that 
Chatsworth High has been participating in for the last three years. Members of 
the plan's management committee decided to phase in the community service 
requirement to bolster students' awareness and pride in their neighborhood, 
said Chatsworth Principal Donna Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth is the only school in the county or city to impose such a 
requirement, said county education officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gets kids to appreciate their community and how they can give back to 
the community," said Smith, who also pointed out that the volunteer program 
allows students to explore career possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 While the logistics of implementing and enforcing the new policy have yet to 
be fully fleshed out, students will be asked to present letters signed by their 
project leader to school officials proving they did their community service 
work.  
</P>
<P>
 All volunteer service must be done after school or on weekends, and no 
academic credit will be given, said Ed Burke, a government teacher and a 
coordinator of last year's senior volunteer program. 
</P>
<P>
 Students can participate in programs already approved by the school or come up 
with their own plans. Some students have already expressed interest in upcoming 
community events, Burke said, like an AIDS march at the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I applaud (Chatsworth High School's) efforts. All high school students should 
have this type of experience," said Los Angeles Board of Education member Julie 
Korenstein. 
</P>
<P>
 The seeds of the community service requirement were sown eight years ago when 
Korenstein set up a voluntary exploratory development program at Chatsworth 
High, in which students could do 90 hours of volunteer work to earn school 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bridge between being a young, inexperienced teen-ager and the 
transition into the work force," Korenstein said, explaining that although the 
young adults are not being paid for their work, their efforts count as work 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the first day of school, 17-year-old Willy Leon, a Chatsworth High 
junior, said he did not know about the new policy. But he proclaimed it "a 
pretty good idea." Leon said he would be most interested in doing volunteer 
work at the high school itself. 
</P>
<P>
 During her tenure as a Los Angeles school board member, Councilwoman Jackie 
Goldberg proposed a districtwide community service requirement. Her proposal 
was not approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were afraid that the record-keeping would be so enormous that it would 
not be possible," Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly I would love to see all the schools individually do this. . . . The 
value of it is hard to deny. Everybody runs about saying how alienated youth 
are. Of course they are. They're not connected. By serving lunches and helping 
out at a child-care center, those kids will feel very different about 
themselves."

QUAKE STILL FELT AS SCHOOLS OPEN; EDUCATION: ABOUT 200 CAMPUSES, INCLUDING SOME 
STILL MAKING REPAIRS, START CLASSES AS TEACHERS CONSIDER A NEW CONTRACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 At Cleveland High School in Reseda, students snaked their way through four 
lines to buy lunch outside the cafeteria, still closed by earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 At Fulton Middle School in Van Nuys, teachers met in daylong planning sessions 
in classrooms with missing ceiling tiles and patched walls. 
</P>
<P>
 At Reseda High School, students took a dance class outside on the asphalt near 
the empty, quake-damaged gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday marked the opening of the fall semester for about 200 Los Angeles 
Unified School District campuses. By all accounts the day went smoothly -- save 
for the constant reminders of last January's earthquake, lower-than-expected 
enrollments and some minor school-bus glitches. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing the best we can," said Bob Kladifko, the principal at Reseda 
High, where the gym, auditorium and a 10-classroom building remain closed due 
to quake damage. "We're just trying to keep an optimistic outlook." 
</P>
<P>
 While new students searched for classrooms and familiar faces, teachers 
throughout the district held lunchtime and after-school meetings Monday to 
learn more about their new contract offer. About 28,000 members of United 
Teachers-Los Angeles are eligible to vote today and Wednesday on whether to 
accept the school district's 8% pay restoration or to strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders have recommended that teachers accept the contract offer, which 
is intended to restore most of the 10% pay cut teachers had to accept two years 
ago. Union leaders predicted that the district will be spared a strike; results 
of the vote will be made public Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are not jumping for joy, but they're happier than they were two years 
ago," said Catherine Carey, the union spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 While hundreds of thousands of students showed up for the first day of school 
Monday, administrators said enrollments were lower than expected across the 
district. But they also said that higher absenteeism is usual during the first 
couple of weeks of class. 
</P>
<P>
 At Canoga Park High, for example, about 1,300 students attended classes Monday 
-- about 200 fewer than expected. And, Reseda High had about 1,500 -- some 500 
fewer than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 In unusual and confusing scheduling this year, most schools will be closed on 
Thursday -- the Jewish Yom Kippur holiday, when absenteeism is often high, 
officials said. Most of those on year-round class schedules will remain open 
however. "Wherever we could close schools and avoid the absenteeism, we did," 
said Bill Rivera, the district's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The transportation system had opening-day problems, with students in some 
schools waiting in the wrong place for buses and others missing their rides 
altogether. District officials said the bus stops and routes will be ironed out 
over the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cleveland High, students were upset that their cafeteria remained closed 
and surrounded by a large chain-link fence because of severe earthquake damage. 
"We don't have our area where we used to hang out," said Maria Andrade, a 
16-year-old sophomore. "It's not the same anymore. We don't have anyplace to 
go." 
</P>
<P>
 While some students bemoaned the state of their campuses, teachers pored over 
details of their contract offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Allie Landers, the union representative at Carver Middle School in 
South-Central Los Angeles: "For the most part, I think teachers agreed this is 
the best we can get right now. They are reluctant to accept anything less than 
10%, but a strike is not what we want at this time either." 
</P>
<P>
 But some campus union leaders said the offer was a hard sell to their 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we had to compromise, but teachers are not 100% or even 80% 
enthusiastic about accepting it," said Lannie Foster, a teacher and union 
representative at Jordan High School in Watts. "But overall, we want to do 
what's best for children, and no one wants to disrupt their education. . . . It 
was a lot to be deluged with on the first day back."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; JEWISH 
GROUP GETS GRANT FOR SENIOR CITIZEN HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A San Fernando Valley Jewish organization has been awarded a federal grant 
worth more than $7 million -- the second largest of its kind given in 
California this year -- to build a housing complex for low-income seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tarzana Lodge of B'nai B'rith received the grant from the U.S. Department 
of Housing and Urban Development as part of an annual housing program for the 
elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 The group plans to use the money for a 91-unit apartment complex to be built 
in 1995 in North Hollywood, where many of its members live. "We've been trying 
for seven years" to get a HUD grant, said lodge spokesman Sy Braverman. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicolas Retsinas, a HUD assistant secretary for housing, said the agency funds 
only about one in eight applicants each year to its Section 202 program. 
Created by the Housing Act of 1959, the program provides capital to nonprofit 
groups for developing rental housing and support services for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea, Braverman said, is "not just to give seniors shelter, but give them 
social services, too," including health and recreation programs at the 
apartment complexes.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK/GLENDALE; 2 GROUPS TO DISCUSS 'SAVE OUR 
STATE' PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two local groups will meet separately next week to debate the merits of the 
so-called "Save Our State" initiative, a controversial measure that would 
eliminate most public services to illegal immigrants if passed. 
</P>
<P>
 The League of Women Voters of Glendale/Burbank will host a forum on 
Proposition 187 at 7:30 p.m. Sept. 22 at the Glendale Board of Education 
building, 223 N. Jackson St.  
</P>
<P>
 The statewide initiative, which will go before voters on the Nov. 6 ballot, 
would deny public education, non-emergency health care and public social 
services to people who are not legally in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which is free and open to the public, will feature Harry Pachon, 
a professor at Scripps College in Claremont and a former consultant to the 
federal Department of Health and Human Services. Pachon will give a 
presentation titled "Prop 187: SOS or False Alarm?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Proponents of the initiative believe that (it) will save the state and local 
governments millions of dollars," said Dick Seeley, an organizer of the event. 
But opponents warn that denying public schooling to illegal immigrants is 
unconstitutional, and denying them health care could lead to "acute 
emergencies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Sept. 22, Tom Chabolla, director of the Office of Justice and Peace 
for the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, will speak on the same topic at 
7:30 p.m. at St. Bede's Church, 214 Foothill Blvd., La Canada. STEVE RYFLE

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; FREE MUSEUM PLANS BENEFIT TO EASE COSTS

 What do Cajun-style cooking and a stompin' zydeco band have to do with 
Burbank's history? 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, nothing. But this Saturday they may play an integral role in 
determining what the future holds for the city's archival past. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to meet rising operating costs, the Burbank Historical Preservation 
Society's financially troubled Gordon R. Howard Museum will hold its first 
fund-raiser. Until now, the museum has been sustained entirely by private 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our maintenance and equipment costs are tremendous, and most of our money is 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first fund-raiser we've felt the need for," said Mary Jane 
Strickland, founder of the preservation society. 
</P>
<P>
 The group manages the Gordon R. Howard Museum's collection of 
turn-of-the-century American furniture, antique clothing and other memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
 A land grant from local real estate developer Gordon R. Howard in 1984 made it 
possible for the society to launch the museum, which features a 1922 bus built 
in Burbank, a 1910 Red Cross quilt and a Lockheed-built display chronicling the 
history of the aviation industry in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sold the land Mr. Howard gave to us for $400,000," Strickland said. 
"(Since then), that money has allowed us both to expand and to continue 
operating without charging the public a dime." 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, the museum also received $250,000 from a private foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 But with a minimum operating budget of $25,000 for general maintenance and 
office supplies, the museum's coffers have become seriously depleted. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, displays and programs could be seriously affected, Strickland 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, I'm determined to keep things running as they are," she said. "We do not 
want to supplement our funds by charging the public a fee. We feel that what 
we're doing should just be seen and that there shouldn't be a price on it. It's 
the best free thing in town." 
</P>
<P>
 The fund-raiser will take place at the museum, 1015 W. Olive Blvd., starting 
at 5 p.m. The $15 to $20 admission will include guided tours of the museum 
grounds, Cajun food and free zydeco dance lessons. ANTONIO OLIVO

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: 3 OF 4 ARRESTED IN BUS 
HIJACKING IDENTIFIED AS GANG MEMBERS

<P>
 Three of four suspects arrested for allegedly hijacking a Las Vegas-bound tour 
bus and robbing its passengers of at least $20,000 are members of Red Door, a 
violent San Gabriel Valley-based gang, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects sport tattoos that indicate their membership in the group 
responsible for extortion, follow-home robberies and at least one murder, 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects are three men and a juvenile. Three of them have confessed to the 
crime, the first of its kind in Los Angeles County, said Sheriff's Capt. Ron 
Black. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities recovered two 9-millimeter semiautomatic handguns, $660 in cash, 
clothes and an unknown amount of Chinese currency. Investigators are looking 
for a fifth suspect, a woman believed to be holding most of the money. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was hurt in the hijacking, and the bus continued to Las Vegas, where 
one of the passengers won $5,000, Black said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bus -- carrying visitors from Taiwan and China, as well as local Chinese 
American residents -- was hijacked about 9:30 a.m. Saturday as it stopped in 
Rowland Heights to pick up passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the suspects, who had tickets for the trip, boarded the bus and 
robbed all 41 people aboard at gunpoint, passing a satchel down the aisle, 
authorities said. They ordered the driver to go to Pomona Boulevard in Pomona, 
where they fled on foot. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the suspects, Yen Chiu, 22, of Rancho Cucamonga, was arrested by Pomona 
police, who had heard about the hijacking on their radio. The others were 
arrested after police served a search warrant at Chiu's car detailing business 
in Pomona. They are Singh Ngyuy, 20, of El Monte, and Houth Tang, 19, and a 
17-year-old juvenile, both from Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The men were being held at the Walnut sheriff's station in lieu of $500,000 
bail, while the youth was at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour was organized by Bravo Tours of Monterey Park. Manager Lucas Sung 
said he would tell future passengers to bring traveler's checks instead of 
cash.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; HUD GRANT AWARDED FOR SENIORS' COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Valley Jewish organization has been awarded a federal grant worth more than 
$7 million -- the second largest of its kind given in California this year -- 
to construct a housing complex for low-income seniors.  
</P>
<P>
 The Tarzana Lodge of B'nai B'rith received the grant from the U.S. Department 
of Housing and Urban Development as part of an annual housing program for the 
elderly.  
</P>
<P>
 The group plans to use the $7,032,700 grant for a 91-unit apartment complex, 
to be built next year near the intersection of Tujunga Boulevard and Otsego 
Street in North Hollywood, where many of the lodge members live. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been trying for seven years" to get a HUD grant, said lodge spokesman 
Sy Braverman. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicolas Retsinas, HUD assistant secretary for housing, said the agency funds 
only about one in eight applicants each year through the program, known as 
Section 202. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the long-sought grant was apparently overwhelming enough to land 
Tarzana Lodge President Milton Bleaman in the hospital after he got word of it 
Sept. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got so excited about it he had a slight heart attack," Braverman said. 
Bleaman was still hospitalized in good condition Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Created by the Housing Act of 1959, Section 202 provides capital to nonprofit 
groups for developing rental housing and support services for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is "not just to give seniors shelter, but give them social services, 
too," Braverman said, including health and recreation programs at the apartment 
complexes to help residents live as independently as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The B'nai B'rith lodge was one of 15 California groups -- seven of which are 
in Los Angeles -- to receive funds this year, totaling nearly $83 million 
statewide. The Chinese Community Housing Corp. of San Francisco received 
$7,627,600, the largest single grant. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, more than $499 million was disbursed to organizations in 40 states and 
Puerto Rico. ERIC SLATER

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUTH LOS ANGELES; 
JOB-TRAINING PROPOSAL TO UNDERGO MORE STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposed $3-million federal grant for a youth job-training center in South 
Los Angeles was sent to two City Council offices for further study after a 
hearing Monday in which questions were raised about the no-bid grant. 
</P>
<P>
 After personal lobbying by U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), the U.S. 
Labor Department recently announced plans to provide the funds to Community 
Build Inc., a riot recovery organization that Waters was instrumental in 
launching. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant needs council approval because federal officials want the city to 
help administer it. 
</P>
<P>
 At the hearing, Councilwoman Rita Walters, whose district includes a portion 
of the neighborhood targeted by the center, questioned the lack of specifics in 
Community Build's plans. When grants are awarded without competitive bidding, 
Walters said, "There's a necessity to meet a higher standard with respect to 
documentation."  
</P>
<P>
 Walters said she was "shocked" to see that her name in the organization's 
documents as a "proposed partner," even though she has had no involvement in 
planning for the job center. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's Community and Economic Development Committee ordered the grant 
reviewed by the offices of Walters and Mark Ridley-Thomas, who has raised 
concerns about the lack of competitive bidding and the limited track record of 
Community Build. The center would be in Ridley-Thomas' district.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; 5-YEAR REDEVELOPMENT PLAN TO BE DISCUSSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A public hearing on a five-year redevelopment plan for North Hollywood will be 
held today at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan for the North Hollywood Redevelopment Project, being drawn up by the 
Community Redevelopment Agency, includes $6.9 million for economic development 
projects and another $3.1 million for housing revitalization. But agency 
officials predict that four years into the plan, they will have no funding for 
new projects, said Walter Beaumont, the agency's community affairs specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency started in 1979 in North Hollywood with a cap of $89 million and 
has cost $77 million so far, not including debt service, Beaumont said. 
Meanwhile, the agency is trying to find alternative sources of funding, 
Beaumont said. 
</P>
<P>
 The redevelopment plan will continue after four years, however, but with no 
new projects. Funds to pay off the plan's debts will come from projects already 
completed or under way, Beaumont said. 
</P>
<P>
 A new state law requires that all community redevelopment agencies adopt a 
five-year plan by the end of the year. Until now, the agency has merely had 
hearings every two years to review what projects had been completed. 
</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood residents, merchants, tenants and property owners are asked to 
attend today's hearing at 5 p.m. at St. David's Episcopal Church, 11605 
Magnolia Blvd. After the hearing, the agency will consider changes to the plan 
before final adoption by its board of directors and approval by the Los Angeles 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is intended to be a guide for redevelopment in North Hollywood, 
although it may be amended by the agency after it is adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are going to be the goals for the next five years," Beaumont said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the possible long-term goals of the plan include widening streets and 
helping homeowners to remodel and renovate their homes. The plan includes a 
goal to build 78 new homes in the 750-acre redevelopment project area between 
Tujunga Avenue to the north and Hatteras Street to the south, with east-west 
boundaries of Cahuenga Boulevard and Camarillo Street. The redevelopment plan 
is also geared to creating jobs and helping businesses in the district. ED BOND

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; D.A. SETS 
UP SPECIAL UNIT TARGETING REAL ESTATE FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti on Monday announced creation of a special unit that 
will prosecute real estate fraud, vowing to put behind bars scam artists who 
rob a vulnerable segment of society."Real estate fraud preys on the elderly. It 
preys on low-income families," Garcetti said. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit, made up of three deputy district attorneys and three investigators, 
is funded for its first year with $500,000 from the Federal Home Loan Mortgage 
Corp. and the Mortgage Insurance Companies of America. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit is one of two funded from outside the district attorney's office 
after a standoff with the County Board of Supervisors was resolved in April, 
freeing up funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Don Tamura, the head of the new unit, said it already is 
tackling 14 cases, including one in which a man with multiple sclerosis was 
kicked out of his home under false pretenses and is now living in his car.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 6 
REDEVELOPMENT AREAS IN QUAKE ZONES PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the latest effort to hasten the city's earthquake recovery, Los Angeles 
redevelopment officials on Monday recommended establishing emergency 
redevelopment areas in six quake-ravaged areas in the San Fernando Valley and 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, the proposed areas are scattered around the damaged neighborhoods, 
reflecting the meandering nature of the quake's destruction, with the biggest 
areas in Northridge, Chatsworth, North Hills and Granada Hills, near the 
epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal would take advantage of emergency provisions of the state 
redevelopment law that allow local agencies to establish project areas in 
disaster zones without completing the time-consuming environmental studies 
required for traditional redevelopment areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, local redevelopment agencies can keep all the property tax 
generated by new construction in a project area and use it to pay for 
improvements, such as new streets, parks and sewers, and loans for quake 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city has rushed to establish the project areas to meet the 
state's emergency guidelines, the Community Redevelopment Agency delayed until 
Friday a vote to launch the proposal because some agency members said they 
needed more time to study the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 At Monday's meeting, redevelopment officials asked the CRA for authority to 
begin a 60-day assessment of the damage in the so-called "study areas" and 
craft recovery strategies.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; DENNY CASE 
DEFENDANT TO BE TRIED ON GUN CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Antoine Miller, a former defendant in the Reginald O. Denny beating case, was 
ordered Monday to stand trial on a charge of being an ex-felon in possession of 
a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief preliminary hearing, Los Angeles Municipal Judge Michael Pastor 
ruled there was sufficient evidence to hold Miller, 22, for trial on the 
allegation that he possessed a semiautomatic pistol on Aug. 26 and violated his 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
 The counts stemmed from an Aug. 21 incident in which he was accused of pulling 
a gun on a group of people in a car near the intersection of Florence and 
Normandie avenues, where Denny was nearly beaten to death on April 29, 1992, as 
the Los Angeles riots broke out.  
</P>
<P>
 Police said Miller ran to a house and got a gun after an argument, then went 
back to the car and fired at three of the occupants, then ran to the driver's 
side and fired point-blank at the man behind the wheel -- only to have the gun 
jam. 
</P>
<P>
 Police obtained a warrant to search Miller's apartment and found the weapon 
under his bed, Officer Michael Real testified Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who is being held without bail, is scheduled to be arraigned in Los 
Angeles Superior Court on Sept. 26.  
</P>
<P>
 He pleaded guilty to felony assault and misdemeanor counts of robbery and 
receiving stolen property and was sentenced to probation for his role in the 
riot incidents at Florence and Normandie.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: BID TO EVICT GOLF COURSE STILL ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a case being watched closely by a host of San Fernando Valley golfers, a 
Los Angeles Superior Court judge Monday refused to throw out a lawsuit that 
seeks to evict the operators of Studio City's only golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 The Weddington Investment Partnership, owners of the 17.2-acre urban plot on 
which Studio City Golf and Tennis sits, filed suit earlier this summer in an 
attempt to evict the operators, claiming their lease expired in 1985. In 
response, the golf course filed a legal paper known as a demure, which requests 
the suit be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Joseph Kalin overruled the demure and scheduled the case for jury trial 
Oct. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute centers around a 39-year-old lease that charges course operators 
rent of just $1,000 a month for the prime real estate in the heart of Studio 
City. In May, the Weddington Partnership discovered that the conditional-use 
permit at the nine-hole course had expired in 1985. The lawsuit claims that the 
bargain-basement lease was nullified upon expiration of the permit. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners have since sought to evict the course operators and sell or lease 
the property to a new tenant at what co-owner Guy Weddington McCreary has 
called a "fair market price." 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing was held in August as the golf course sought a new conditional-use 
permit to continue operating, but Associate Zoning Administrator Horace Tramel 
declined to rule on the request until the dispute over the lease was resolved. 
To even apply for a permit, he said, the golf course had to be either the owner 
or legal tenant of the property, and it was unclear whether the golf course was 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 While the case is working its way toward the courtroom, a flicker of an 
out-of-court resolution came out of a closed-door meeting two weeks ago, 
according to attorneys from both sides. Representatives of the golf course and 
the Weddington partnership discussed renegotiating the original lease. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parties did have one negotiating session, which was not attended by 
lawyers," said Los Angeles attorney Jerald Gale , who represents the Weddington 
side. "I would anticipate that there would probably be more." ERIC SLATER

MENENDEZ JUROR SUES ANOTHER OVER COMMENTS; LITIGATION: ALTERNATE WHO WAS 
DISMISSED DURING TRIAL SAYS STATEMENTS BY A TV TALK SHOW GUEST SLANDERED HER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the jurors from the Menendez brothers murder trial is suing another 
over comments made during a TV talk show that aired Monday, alleging his 
remarks were slanderous. 
</P>
<P>
 Judith Kaplan Zamos, 55, of Woodland Hills filed the suit in San Fernando 
Superior Court against Jude Nelson, 53, of Sylmar, asserting that he slandered 
her when he said on "The Maury Povich Show" that she was dismissed from jury 
service for "misconduct." 
</P>
<P>
 In the suit, filed by her attorney husband, Zamos, a nurse and teacher, said 
she was dismissed not for wrongdoing but at her request for "personal and 
philosophical concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit adds yet another twist to the soap opera surrounding Lyle and Erik 
Menendez, the Beverly Hills brothers charged with murder in the Aug. 20, 1989, 
shotgun slayings of their wealthy parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
 It also highlights the bitter divisions produced by the brothers' first trial, 
which ended in January with separate juries -- one for each brother -- split 
between murder and lesser manslaughter charges. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing is scheduled for Oct. 27 in Van Nuys Superior Court to set a new 
trial date. The brothers remain in County Jail without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 At the first trial, Nelson served as Juror No. 4 on the Lyle Menendez jury. He 
voted for first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamos was an alternate on the Lyle Menendez jury. She did not take part in 
deliberations, but has said that she would have voted for manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Povich show, taped Aug. 26 at a New York studio and aired Monday in Los 
Angeles on KCAL (Channel 9), Nelson and Zamos freely traded insults. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'd like to say is if Judy is normal, I wouldn't want to be normal for 
anything," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, he said: "I cannot believe that we have jurisprudence such that they 
would get people on a, on a capital murder case -- " 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, Zamos interrupted: "Oh, God, he's learned a three-syllable 
word." Moments later, she added: "Listen to this guy. Can you believe how 
ignorant he is? Would you want your life to be in this man's hands?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Ignorant?" he retorted. "Oh, come on, give me a break, lady." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I need to give you a break," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Zamos sued Aug. 30, alleging that Nelson slandered her when he 
accused her during the broadcast of misconduct. Nelson said he had heard from 
an attorney connected to the case that she had "called in and complained" 
during the trial about an interview with Dominick Dunne, who was writing about 
the trial for Vanity Fair magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors in a criminal case are not permitted to read newspaper accounts or 
watch TV reports about the case while it is in trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson also said Zamos wrote letters complaining about him to Judge Stanley M. 
Weisberg. "This is the most bizarre thing I have ever heard," she said on the 
Povich show. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamos told the audience that she was not kicked off the jury. In fact, she 
said, she became troubled upon hearing of "some of the things that were 
happening in the jury room," and asked to be released from service. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains unclear how Zamos would have learned of events in the jury room, 
because deliberations are supposed to remain secret, even from alternate 
jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamos was dismissed from the jury by Weisberg after several closed-door 
hearings. A Jan. 5 order does not say why she was excused. Her husband, 
Woodland Hills lawyer Jerome Zamos, said she was never told that she had done 
anything wrong. "If she was dismissed for cause, shouldn't she know it?" he 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was present when she was dismissed," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Pamela 
Bozanich, the chief prosecutor in the first trial. "I'd be happy to testify for 
Mr. Nelson." 
</P>
<P>
 She did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Jill Lansing, who was Lyle Menendez's lead defense lawyer in the first trial, 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit seeks general and punitive damages and court costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, who is unemployed, said Monday that he was "surprised and shocked" by 
the suit. "She has her husband to represent her, so her attorney fees are 
virtually nil," he said. "She knows I'm out of work and cannot afford to hire 
an attorney to answer this. It's pretty petty and in and of itself is 
malicious."

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: FEMA STARTS LETTER DRIVE FOR QUAKE AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To ensure that all earthquake victims have an opportunity to apply for federal 
aid, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has begun to send 620,000 letters 
with additional information and toll-free assistance numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA began sending the letters out Friday to encourage all quake victims to 
submit completed aid requests by the Oct. 17 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA officials had originally planned to send the letters out by the end of 
August, but because of delays in working out the details of the letters, they 
were not ready to send until Friday, spokesman Russ Edmonston said. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters come a month after federal officials released the results of a 
survey that showed many quake victims did not complete their loan applications 
because they did not understand the Small Business Administration's procedures 
and needed more information. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters will be sent to every person who registered for aid with FEMA. But 
not everybody will get the same letter. One version of the letter specifically 
addresses aid to business owners, while another version offers assistance to 
single-family homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, FEMA has approved more than $1 billion in temporary shelter funding 
and another $909 million to rebuild buildings, roads and other public 
facilities. For its part, the SBA has approved more than $3 billion in quake 
recovery loans. HUGO MARTIN

MAN SHOOTS PASSENGER TO DEATH ON MTA BUS 
</P>

 A young man was gunned down on a bus in southwest Los Angeles in an apparently 
gang-related slaying Monday as 20 fellow passengers watched in horror, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Lt. Sergio Robleto said the killing -- committed in the 
style of a street gang "hit" -- occurred in broad daylight about 1 p.m. as 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority Bus 207 traveled north on Western Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 As the bus approached 89th Street, he said, a young man boarded and started up 
the aisle. When he spotted the victim, who was already on the bus, the killer 
"just got up, walked toward the victim and opened fire, shooting several 
times," Robleto said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the gunman stepped off the bus and into a white Volkswagen Cabriolet 
waiting in traffic nearby, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The assailant, who is being sought by police, was described as an African 
American man in his mid-20s wearing a green, long-sleeved shirt and blue pants. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, a man in his 20s whose name was not released pending notification 
of his family, had no time to either speak or run, the lieutenant added. 
However, the behavior of the killer and the manner of the slaying lead police 
to believe it was gang-related, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 No other passengers were threatened by the gunman, Robleto said, adding that 
the attack "was very much directed at one individual. . . . It was more a 'hit' 
type of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, he said, the gunfire caused panic among the people on the bus, 
who stampeded for the exits, trampling one woman in the rush for safety. 
</P>
<P>
 That woman was taken to Centinela Hospital Medical Center in Inglewood, where 
she was treated for minor injuries and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Police dispatched crisis teams to reassure the frightened passengers, Robleto 
said.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: BERNARDI SUIT AGAINST CITY IS DISMISSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge Monday dismissed a lawsuit filed by former Councilman 
Ernani Bernardi against the City of Los Angeles and its redevelopment agency, 
alleging that agendas relating to a redevelopment project violated the state's 
public meeting laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernardi, a fierce critic of redevelopment projects who served on the council 
for 32 years, has filed four lawsuits against city and county officials over 
agendas and meetings that he contends have violated the Ralph M. Brown Open 
Meetings Act.The act requires virtually all government meetings to be held in 
public, said Jeffrey Cohen, an attorney for Bernardi.  
</P>
<P>
 Cohen said the agendas and closed-door meetings have dealt with the city and 
county's plan to lift a $750-million spending cap on the city's redevelopment 
project for the central business district and the division of property tax 
revenues that such a move would create. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge dismissed one of the lawsuits Monday, which alleged, among other 
things, that agendas for a pair of December, 1993, meetings held by the city 
and its Community Redevelopment Agency violated the Brown Act because they were 
incomplete and misleading, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the case is far from over since the same judge also granted Bernardi 20 
days to file an amended lawsuit, said June Ailin, an attorney representing the 
city. The City Council voted in February to spend $50,000 to hire a law firm to 
fight the suits and increase the spending cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen said he plans to file an amended lawsuit, which will again seek a court 
order to nullify actions taken during the December meetings and also stop city 
officials from violating the Brown Act in the future. The three other lawsuits 
are pending. JULIE TAMAKI

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; CITY OKS SURCHARGE TO BOOST RECYCLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Calabasas City Council, in an effort to expand the city's recycling 
program, has approved a surcharge on businesses and multifamily dwellings that 
would be reduced if they participate in the recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new regulation, businesses and multifamily dwellings will be charged 
50 cents per cubic yard of trash they generate each month. Single-family units 
already pay the surcharge under an existing city ordinance, enacted in May, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Funds raised by the surcharge will go toward a city program set up to comply 
with a state law that requires cities to cut down on the amount of trash they 
send to landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 While nobody wants to pay more in fees, "this is a state-mandated program, and 
we really don't have much choice," said City Councilman Marvin Lopata. The vote 
on introducing the surcharge, taken last week, was unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a state law enacted in 1989, communities must divert from landfills 25% 
of their waste by Dec. 31, 1995, and 50% by Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Multidwelling units and businesses were not included in the initial city 
ordinance because the city's recycling program was designed to be introduced in 
phases, starting with single-family units, said Susan Zalusky, city recycling 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "Currently, we've got close to two-thirds of the commercial business community 
voluntarily recycling," she said, adding that many are already using recycling 
bins. "I think businesses are more aware of the waste. They see more of it, and 
they know more about what can be recycled." 
</P>
<P>
 The new ordinance encourages businesses and multifamily dwellings to recycle 
by reducing the 50-cent surcharge if they use some of their trash bins for 
recycling, she said. For example, a business with two, three-cubic-yard bins 
would save $1.50 in surcharge fees a month per pickup if it used one of those 
bins for recyclable items. 
</P>
<P>
 The average business, which has pickups twice a week, would save $10 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We now have everybody at a point where they are able to recycle," Zalusky 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have done very well. We have hit 19% just with the single family and with 
the rest involved, we see no problem with meeting the 25%." FRANK MANNING

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: SALES ARE BRISK FOR CUT-RATE AIR FARES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Area travel agents say many San Fernando Valley residents are taking advantage 
of the latest round of fare-cutting by most major airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our business is going crazy," said Annette Pressman, co-owner of Willett 
Travel, Studio City, which says it is the oldest travel agency in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two months, airlines have slashed fares dramatically, trying to 
boost leisure travel during the typically slow end-of-summer period. The latest 
round of cut-rate fares began last week when Continental Airlines Inc. 
announced discounted rates on domestic travel. 
</P>
<P>
 American Airlines, Delta Air Lines Inc., UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, Trans 
World Airlines Inc. and USAir Group Inc. all matched Continental discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The low fares, which can save travelers as much as $100 per ticket in some 
cases, are available only through Friday, and apply mainly to trips between 
Sept. 21 and Dec. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 The discounts do not apply to travel around Thanksgiving -- the busiest travel 
period of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's taking advantage of the air-fare wars," Pressman said. "They come 
and they go. For us, it's not so fun, because we exchange tickets for the lower 
prices. But people are going everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, she has seen heavier bookings than usual to several cities in 
particular, including San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, New York and Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 But other travel agents say fare wars are not always as wonderful as they 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not everybody who calls will get the discount," said Christina Adams, owner 
of New Age Travel in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 If an airplane has 100 seats, possibly only 20 may be available at the 
discount rate. "Then they'll tell you, 'Sorry, that fare has sold out,' and ask 
you if you'll take a more expensive fare," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Air fare wars begin when one airline announces discounted rates, which are 
then matched or beaten by other airlines. As each airline discounts further, 
prices are driven lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental initiated a previous fare war last month, prompting a two-week 
ticket-buying binge during which fares were lower than some travel agents said 
they had seen in years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people will not go on a trip for $630, but they'll go for $338," said 
Pressman. "It generates business." Currently, a round-trip ticket to New York 
that typically costs around $450 can be bought for about $350. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Continental said the lower rates give people "an incentive to 
get off their couches and away from their TVs and go travel." 
</P>
<P>
 Continental's previous discount period ended Aug. 26. Dave Messing, spokesman 
for Continental, said the airline decided to offer the latest discount rates 
because the airline feared many people were on vacation the two weeks during 
August when the low rates were offered.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's either we offer the discount, or someone else will," Messing said. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Hicks, president of Studio City Travel, added that airlines continue 
to attach restrictions to their discount rates, making it difficult for many 
people to match arrival and departure dates with vacation plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another fare war, big deal," Hicks said. "September is a hard time for people 
to travel." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she said, "for those who can go, it's a bargain." TIM MAY

LAKE RESIDENTS SAY THEY'VE BEEN LEFT HIGH, DRY; DISPUTE: DOCKS REST ON DIRT AS 
WESTLAKE VILLAGE GOLF COURSE LEGALLY SIPHONS WATER. MANAGEMENT SAYS IT CAN'T 
STOP THE PUMPING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A battle over water has erupted on tranquil Westlake Lake, where residents 
this week watched lake levels dip to record lows while the owners of a nearby 
golf course sprinkled the links with hundreds of gallons of lake water. 
</P>
<P>
 So angry are the residents that they have initiated a vitriolic letter-writing 
campaign to decry lake management and call for the end to a decades-old 
agreement giving the golf course water rights.  
</P>
<P>
 Residents said in letters circulated this week that they can no longer allow 
the lake's water level to drop. On the lake's perimeter, docks rest on dry dirt 
and boats scrape the lake floor. Small islands of land have surfaced where the 
water was once deep and glassy. 
</P>
<P>
 Statements sent out to the 1,200 residents who live along the man-made lake, 
which straddles the border between Ventura and Los Angeles counties, call for 
the ouster of Ben Schulman, president of the lake management association. 
</P>
<P>
 And the letters object to a proposed contract with the owners of the Westlake 
Village Golf Course that would continue to allow greenskeepers to siphon 
hundreds of gallons of lake water each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight residents of the once-quiet community are expected to confront the 
lake's nine-member management board with their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a wild meeting," said lakeside homeowner William Rolland. 
"People are extremely concerned about our board allowing the golf course to 
rape our lake." 
</P>
<P>
 Schulman, who has been involved in managing the lake for six years, said the 
campaign against him has been rife with misinformation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Westlake Lake Management Assn., he said, does not have the power to 
prevent golf course owners from taking lake water. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the lake and the Westlake Village Golf Course were built by the 
American-Hawaiian Steamship Co. in the late 1960s. The developer included in 
the code that governs the lake's management a requirement that the golf course 
have access to the lake water. Schulman said he believes that stipulation 
cannot be changed, but residents disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 Only when the lake's surface level drops 24 inches can the lake managers cut 
off the golf-course supply. Schulman estimates the level is presently 14 to 16 
inches below normal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've looked at the agreements and I've talked with lawyers," he said. "We 
just don't have the right to ask them to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the dispute has been the fate of two wells that are used to 
pump water into the lake from an aquifer, one of several sources of lake water. 
</P>
<P>
 The company received title to the wells even though area homeowners, through 
the lake management, had for 20 years been paying to service and operate them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A contract with PYJ, Schulman said, would mean the homeowners would regain 
part ownership of the wells, and the golf course would have to begin paying for 
some pumping and repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I wanted to do was raise this as a possibility, given that the golf 
course has been getting a free ride for water," Schulman said. "What I've 
gotten in return have been these outrageous attacks." 
</P>
<P>
 One letter accuses Schulman of betraying homeowners; another includes personal 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolland, one of those leading the effort against Schulman, said the anger is 
warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we enter into this kind of agreement, we would be selling out half the 
lake for the next 200 years," Rolland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks Planning Commissioner Irving Wasserman, who lives in the lake 
community, said he will ask the cities of Thousand Oaks and Westlake Village to 
create an oversight committee to help resolve these issues in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolland said he plans at tonight's meeting to ask for a change in the 
association's codes to prevent the golf course from using any more water. The 
proposal, he said, would recommend that the board use its funds to begin 
drilling a new well. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will be held at 7 tonight at the Westlake Yacht Club, 32123 W. 
Lindero Canyon Road, Westlake Village.

NORTHRIDGE BREAK-INS SPUR WARNING TO LOCK DOORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A string of late-night burglaries in Northridge has prompted police to warn 
residents to lock their doors and windows before going to bed. 
</P>
<P>
 They hope that cooling temperatures may take care of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department does not believe the burglaries were 
committed by the same person, but robbery detectives said several similarities 
among the crimes led them to believe the break-ins may be connected. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were getting a trend in (burglars) going into residences through unlocked 
doors and windows, so we're letting people know to secure their residences," 
said Detective Russ Lyons. 
</P>
<P>
 Since August, Lyons said there have been 12 burglaries in the area bordered by 
Devonshire Street, Roscoe Boulevard, Tampa Avenue and Balboa Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the break-ins occurred at single-family homes between 11 p.m. and 5 
a.m. That is unusual, Lyons said, "because most residential burglaries occur 
during the day, when people are not at home." 
</P>
<P>
 In each incident, a burglar entered through an open door or window and took 
"small items, such as purses, wallets and jewelry," Lyons said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one has been injured during the robberies, and most of the victims were 
asleep when the break-ins occurred, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said many residents have been leaving doors and windows open at night 
due to the hot weather. But as autumn approaches, Lyons said the situation 
might take care of itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been hot, but as the weather starts cooling off, maybe we'll have less 
of a problem," he said.

VALLEY INTERVIEW; FIRE CHIEF STRESSES COMMUNICATION, PRECAUTIONS IN HEAT OF 
BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County firefighters are gearing up for what could be another tough 
wildfire season in the Southland this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 It is coming only two months after 14 firefighters died July 6 near the center 
of a wildfire in western Colorado. Federal authorities later concluded that 
human errors contributed to the disaster. The errors included a failure to set 
up adequate escape routes and safety zones and a lack of communication among 
firefighting organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County last year had the biggest fires in the area's history. They 
raged from the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains to the Malibu hillsides 
overlooking the Pacific Ocean. This year, county firefighters will bring some 
new equipment into the fray, including the CL-215T, usually referred to as the 
Super Scooper, an airplane that can scoop up to 14,000 gallons of water in a 
single pass as it flies a few feet above a large body of water. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the latest high-tech aids, firefighters' fate can be decided by a 
barely noticeable shift in the wind or a garbled or slightly misunderstood 
communication, county Fire Chief P. Michael Freeman explained in an interview 
with staff writer Chip Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: About two months ago, a Colorado fire killed 14 firefighters. Will 
you be looking into that fire? What kind of precautions do you take to guard 
against that kind of disaster?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: We will be looking at the Colorado report, and we will share the 
information we learn with our employees. 
</P>
<P>
 What is always primary is to allow for safety margins. In a wildfire 
situation, the fire can be so easily and quickly affected by the weather, the 
subtleties. A slight shift in the wind can turn a lazily burning fire into an 
inferno. 
</P>
<P>
 What we do is teach, we train, we drill on the basic rules of engagement. We 
talk about the types of situations that we should watch for, and we rely 
heavily on good communications. When a crew is out working on a wildlife fire, 
there are many other resources, crews and equipment working on the fire, and 
it's crucial that they talk to each other and stay in good coordination. 
</P>
<P>
 Given all of that, a situation can occur that can cause a fire to blow up, and 
we train to have a safe refuge area, a point everyone can get to safely that is 
adequate for their safety. We use aluminized protective shelters. In the 
worst-case scenario, you have to deploy that shelter, which takes about half a 
minute, and it takes practice, practice and more practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about communications with air support and men on the ground?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We basically have three layers, communications on the ground and ground to 
air helicopters and a line of communication between the helicopters and outside 
agency tanker aircraft. What we have to do sometimes to is bridge 
communications between the air tankers and the commanders on the ground. 
Sometimes the commander will talk to the helicopter and then relay that 
information to the air attack. But generally where most of our communication 
occurs is between ground forces and our own helicopter force. Sometimes the 
helicopter crews are talking to hand crews, supervisors and foremen in many 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why is that?  
</P>
<P>
 A: In a brush fire, without structures being threatened, the crew is doing the 
real work, trying to cut a line around the fire. The helicopters drop water in 
front of that line. Crews keep one foot in the black area and one foot outside 
the burn. There is some degree of safety in the burn area.  
</P>
<P>
 I have to qualify that because the steepness of the terrain may have a bearing 
as well as the intensity of the fire. It sometimes isn't humanly possible to 
stay there because of the sheer heat. You're so close to where it has burned, 
the ground, the rocks are so hot you couldn't touch them. If you had to stay on 
the ground for more than a minute, you would probably get burned through your 
suit by the radiant heat. You're as close to the fire as you can get. The idea 
is to scratch the line around the fire. In combat, we try to cut a sufficiently 
wide line to stop the fire but not as deep as when we improve the line once we 
get a line around the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What happened in Altadena last year, when two firefighters died?  
</P>
<P>
 A: This was the fire that ultimately came down and burned 155 homes and burned 
for several days. It was the first major loss fire of the year in L.A. County. 
</P>
<P>
 The crews had to deploy their shelters. It was a critical situation. It was a 
case where the wind and terrain gave them no choice other than to deploy. 
</P>
<P>
 Basically what happened is a fire had burned up a side of the canyon rapidly. 
We didn't have high winds, but it was a combination of topography and light 
winds. It ran up one side of the canyon, and a crew was working its way down 
from the top. They had cut a line from the head of the fire, working with 
helicopters. The crew appeared to be safe, but their vision was obstructed by 
the nob of the hill that stuck out. The terrain was very steep, and they had a 
lookout in position to try and look around the nob. But it turned out in 
retrospect that the lookout's vision was cut off as well. 
</P>
<P>
 A small, undetected amount of fire was below them and around the nob. They 
were on a west slope, and the fire came up the east slope, and as the fire made 
its run, and it was intense, part of the fire hooked around the nob and came 
toward them. They had one foot in the black, and they were cutting a line below 
fuel, and there was just instantaneously a wall of heat and fire across the 
crew. They were advised to retreat and they did, but four of them were trapped 
and caught by the flames. Two of them were seriously burned, and two others, 
due to smoke inhalation, succumbed to their injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Have there been more or fewer prescribed burns this year?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We burned less this year than last year, because of all the hot weather. 
We've had more than 12 days of prescribed burns canceled this year because of 
the weather. I was at one of these prescribed burns, and they had to call it 
off because of high temperatures and low humidity. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no guarantee we will meet our goal, which this year was between 3,000 
and 5,000 acres. One of the things we are looking at is, are there other ways 
to crush this fuel. One way is to change its configuration to make it burn less 
rapidly and easier to control. The way the fuel is arranged when it's straight 
up allows it to burn at its strongest configuration. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about the areas hardest hit by fire last year?  
</P>
<P>
 A: In those areas, the hazards of big fires would be substantially less. Some 
rejuvenation has begun, but it will be many years before there is fuel like 
there was a year ago. There are still thousands and thousands of acres that 
remain as a serious threat to homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are there areas this year that are being closely monitored?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, all of the brush areas that expose homes and structures -- the La 
Crescenta, La Canada-Flintridge areas. Parts of Altadena, the Santa Monica 
Mountains including Malibu, Calabasas and the Agoura Hills area. Santa Clarita 
and certainly parts of Antelope Valley, which have been spared, but about three 
weeks ago we had the Leona Valley fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What kinds of conditions exist this year for another round of major 
wildfires?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We've had a number of fires already. The fuel is dry. The live fuel 
moisture is at a lower level than it was at this point last year, which is not 
surprising when you consider the repeated heat waves we've had this year. 
</P>
<P>
 On the positive side, we have been working closely with communities that are 
close to the brush and have been advising them of the dangers and encouraging 
them to help us clear brush and fuel. We've done massive mailing reminding them 
about defensible spaces around their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is new about dispatch practices this year?  
</P>
<P>
 A: When a fire is reported, when anyone requests a second alarm, our dispatch 
center makes a call to a fixed-wing tanker. That was not automatic last year. 
The best thing we can do for safety is to knock these things down fast, and I'm 
looking for new ways to deploy old tools. The newest thing we're looking at is 
the CL-215T. It's commonly referred to as the Super Scooper. It's our newest 
tool. The idea is to get this plane and its crew and the helicopters to the 
scene within 20 minutes. The aircraft can scoop up to 14,000 gallons of water, 
moving at more than 100 m.p.h. within 10 seconds. But they cost $17 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What other precautions have you taken this year?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We formed the Wildlife Safety Panel, which was commissioned by the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors last year. It is made up of professionals 
from all over who looked at structures, water supply, brush clearance and other 
safety measures. The study made 40 recommendations, and we have implemented a 
number of them. We also have implemented Operation Firestop, which is primarily 
members of my staff that I put into a task force to deal with operational 
departmental procedures, training, updating an attack plan, accessing swimming 
pool water better -- a whole host of things, including the helicopters and 
first response. 
</P>
<P>
 We're trying to improve ourselves from what we've learned and do our damnedest 
to do better. We stop more than 90% of most brush fires before they get 
rolling, but those aren't the ones that make the news. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of the ones we handle aren't the ones that made headline news. 
</P>
<P>
 The ones that made the news were the ones pushed by Santa Ana winds, and this 
year we're trying to do everything humanly possible to look Mother Nature in 
the eye when she brings that Santa Ana and win that battle.

SMOKER SHOT DEPUTY AFTER BEING TOLD TO LEAVE STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 A burning cigarette and a locked-up girlfriend apparently prompted the 
shooting of a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy inside the Carson station by 
a man who was then shot and killed by other deputies, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He apparently came in to get some information on a female who was in 
custody," Sheriff's Department spokesman Deputy Brian Jones said of the dead 
gunman, identified as Robert Almeida, 25, of Carson."He walked in with a 
cigarette and was told to leave because it's illegal to smoke inside. He went 
out, came back and did the deed." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's investigators said Almeida, a reported gang member with a criminal 
record, opened fire with a .38-caliber handgun about 10:30 p.m. Saturday, 
wounding Deputy Robert Frank, 25, who was at the lobby counter. Three other 
deputies inside the station rushed out and shot Almeida in the upper body, 
killing him. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Department spokesmen said Frank was in stable condition Monday after 
undergoing surgery for gunshot wounds in both arms. Several people who were in 
the lobby when the shooting erupted were not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said there was no argument between Almeida and the deputy before the 
shooting -- Almeida was simply told to take the cigarette outside. Frank was 
talking on the phone when Almeida walked back in and never saw the gun being 
pointed at him, said Sgt. Lynn Reeder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bam, it was over," Reeder said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added, "I don't know if we'll ever know what was going on in his 
(Almeida's) mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Department spokesmen said it was the first such incident in the 
Carson station's 20-year history. No additional security measures have been 
undertaken, they said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: THOUSAND OAKS; AIDS 
CARE RECEIVES $5,000 AMGEN GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nonprofit support group AIDS Care Inc. has received a $5,000 grant from 
the Amgen Foundation to help indigent Ventura County residents affected by HIV 
or AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of our clients are indigent, and they need help to buy medication, pay 
rent or keep their phones turned on," said Doug Green, executive director of 
AIDS Care. 
</P>
<P>
 The Amgen Foundation donation will also boost AIDS Care's $200,000 annual 
budget, which suffered a blow earlier this year when the group failed to win a 
grant from the county's HIV consortium.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the foundation also awarded AIDS Care $5,000, and stipulated that 
the grant be used to help clients buy prescription drugs. Amgen Inc., a global 
biotechnology company, markets Epogen, a drug used by some patients infected 
with the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; COUNCIL SESSIONS TO BE TAPED FOR TV; 
GOVERNMENT: THE MEETINGS WILL BE SHOWN ON CABLE PUBLIC ACCESS CHANNEL THE NIGHT 
AFTER THEY OCCUR.

 Tape Delayed! From Santa Clarita! It's Tuesday Night! 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning tonight, City Council sessions will be videotaped for showings on 
Santa Clarita's fledgling public access channel.But it's not exactly a gala 
debut.  
</P>
<P>
 The meetings will be taped with a single camera, volunteers will run the 
equipment, and the meetings will be shown without editing, said Gail Foy, city 
public information officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Showing City Council and other local governmental meetings on television was 
first discussed during the 1980s, when efforts began for Santa Clarita to 
become a city, according to Allan Cameron, a participant in the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say the thing that astounds me is this is common in more than 300 
cities in California alone," Cameron said. "Not only do I not understand why it 
has taken so long, I don't know why it's not being broadcast live." 
</P>
<P>
 Foy said it was a matter of cost. She estimated that it would cost the city 
$150,000 to $200,000 to purchase equipment and hire a part-time employee to air 
council meetings as they occur. 
</P>
<P>
 The TV debut is welcomed by those who say the the cable access program will 
increase the accountability of city officials. But others fear the influence of 
cameras in the council chambers, saying their presence may encourage 
grandstanding by those addressing the council, political hopefuls or council 
members themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Council meetings are held on the second and third Tuesday of each month. They 
are scheduled to be shown on the Wednesdays following the meetings on cable 
channel 20 at 5 p.m.

 A Santa Clarita man who is a former elementary school teacher and sheriff's 
deputy pleaded not guilty Monday to charges of sexually assaulting three women, 
including a co-worker in a classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Keith Culhane, 35, entered the plea to seven counts including forcible 
rape, sexual battery by restraint and rape by foreign object.The alleged 
victims are a woman, then 17, whom Culhane is charged with raping in June, 
1990, when he was a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department deputy; a 
44-year-old teacher and a woman, then 19, whom he had employed as a 
baby-sitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Culhane remains free on $50,000 bail. A pretrial hearing is scheduled Oct. 12 
in Superior Court in Van Nuys. No trial date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
 Culhane's arraignment had been postponed for two weeks because he said 
preliminary legal battles left him unable to afford an attorney.

KKR WILL BUY BORDEN IN $2-BILLION DEAL; MERGERS: IT IS THE BIGGEST ACQUISITION 
BY KOHLBERG KRAVIS ROBERTS & CO. SINCE IT TOOK OVER RJR NABISCO IN 1989. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cash-starved dairy and pasta company Borden Inc. agreed to be acquired by 
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. in a $2-billion deal that marks the biggest 
purchase by the leveraged-buyout firm since its takeover of RJR Nabisco 
Holdings Corp. in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 KKR, based in New York, will pay for the acquisition with RJR Nabisco stock. 
For Columbus, Ohio-based Borden, which has been struggling with money-losing 
dairy operations and heavy debt, the price of $14.25 a share may be the best it 
could get, analysts said. As recently as December, the stock was trading above 
$18 a share. In 1991, it reached a high of $38.75. 
</P>
<P>
 By paying with RJR Nabisco stock, KKR will pare its once-controlling stake in 
the tobacco and consumer products firm to $2 billion, or less than a quarter of 
the voting shares. The RJR Nabisco acquisition--America's biggest corporate 
takeover--capped the frenzied deal making of the 1980s and crowned KKR as the 
king of the leveraged buyout. 
</P>
<P>
 But RJR Nabisco has not performed well for KKR and its investors, so the 
Borden deal may provide an escape route from the tobacco industry. The industry 
has come under increasing pressure from internal price wars, municipal smoking 
bans and Congress, which sees cigarettes as a source of tax revenue to help 
finance federal health reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Under KKR's complicated buyout proposal, Borden would become a private company 
headed by its current senior managers, including Chief Executive Ervin Shames, 
54, a former executive of Kraft General Foods who came aboard last year, and 
Chairman Frank J. Tasco, 66. 
</P>
<P>
 Borden stockholders would get RJR Nabisco stock. At the completion of the 
deal, KKR would retain 80% of Borden, and RJR Nabisco would purchase the 
remaining 20%, paying with $500 million in newly issued stock. RJR Nabisco 
would also receive a warrant to purchase an additional 10% interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is clear that additional investment in our brands and in capital are 
needed in order to capture the company's potential," Tasco said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Borden is perhaps best known for the Elsie the Cow logo that decorates its 
Eagle Brand condensed milk and other dairy products. Among its other brands are 
Prince spaghetti, Pennsylvania Dutch egg noodles, Wise potato chips, Cracker 
Jack, ReaLemon lemon juice and Cremora coffee creamer. The profitable non-food 
division includes Elmer's glue, wallpaper and bonding materials for the 
construction industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Borden, which slashed its dividend by 75% last year and had been selling 
operations at cut rates to raise money, did not have enough free cash to market 
its products, said analyst Allan S. Roness of Fahnestock & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they could have continued this way without sinking into a 
financial black hole," Roness said. 
</P>
<P>
 Borden tried to put itself up for sale last year but received no bids. The 
company's dairy operations have lost an estimated $30 million in the first half 
of this year, said analyst Nomi Ghez of Goldman Sachs. Without the cash to 
finance marketing and advertising, Borden's brand recognition has been 
slipping, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the link to RJR Nabisco and its managerial acumen may help 
Borden improve its operations. RJR Nabisco will have 20% representation on 
Borden's board and may purchase some Borden businesses later, RJR Nabisco said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "With greater access to capital and an incentive compensation program that 
encourages managers to think like owners, Borden will be well positioned to 
develop the full value of its many strong underlying assets and excellent 
brands," Henry Kravis and George Roberts, founding partners of KKR, said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Borden stock jumped $2 to $13.625 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
RJR Nabisco shares lost 37.5 cents, closing at $6.625. KKR's Holdings 
</P>
<P>
 Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., which Monday agreed to buy dairy goods and 
pasta maker Borden Inc., was one of the kings of the 1980s leveraged-buyout 
boom, using small amounts of equity and large amounts of bank loans and junk 
bonds to acquire stakes in some of America's best-known companies. KKR's buying 
binge has slowed in recent years. Here is a look at some of the firm's chief

GERMAN FIRM TO RECLAIM BAYER ASPIRIN NAME; DRUGS: IT WILL ACQUIRE STERLING 
WINTHROP'S OVER-THE-COUNTER BUSINESS AND RECOVER THE RIGHTS IT LOST AFTER WWI. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Bayer didn't work wonders for its previous owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the German company that developed the popular painkiller in 1897 says it 
is regaining U.S. trademark rights that it lost after World War I and hopes to 
revive the brand. 
</P>
<P>
 Bayer said Monday that it will regain the U.S. rights to the Bayer aspirin 
name by acquiring Sterling Winthrop's over-the-counter medication business in 
the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico from Britain's SmithKline Beecham for 
$1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Just two weeks ago, SmithKline bought Sterling's worldwide OTC business from 
Eastman Kodak Co. for $2.9 billion. Bayer had lost out to British-based 
SmithKline in the bidding for the entire Sterling business, but it now will get 
about a third of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Bayer, a chemical and pharmaceuticals firm, lost U.S. trademark rights to 
Bayer 75 years ago, when German properties were seized as part of World War I 
reparations. Sterling bought Bayer's U.S. operations -- including the right to 
the Bayer name -- at auction for $5.3 million in 1918. 
</P>
<P>
 Bayer has been fighting since then to regain U.S. rights and has traded 
lawsuits with Sterling for more than 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the German namesake firm is acquiring a product that was mostly a headache 
for its longtime owner, Kodak. While U.S. sales in the $2.4-billion analgesics 
market have been flat, sales of Bayer and the non-aspirin Bayer Select products 
fell 17% to $126.6 million for the 12 months ended July 31, according to market 
researcher Information Resource's Towne-Oller & Associates unit. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Bayer has watched aspirin sales slip as rival analgesics such as 
acetaminophen-based Tylenol and ibuprofen-based Advil gained ground. Last year, 
Bayer struck back by introducing Bayer Select, a group of products based on 
ibuprofen and acetaminophen. But the new products haven't caught on. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realize that Bayer aspirin in the United States does not have the most 
modern or progressive image and has been struggling for market share," said 
Thomas Reinert, a spokesman at Bayer headquarters in Leverkusen, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe we can push it to a stronger position," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinert said the Bayer brand name and symbol -- a circle and cross formed by 
spelling Bayer horizontally and vertically -- is much better known in Europe 
and other markets. He said Bayer will aggressively promote the Bayer name and 
trademark to increase its visibility in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 While Bayer aspirin and Bayer Select make up about a third of the business 
acquired from SmithKline, Bayer is getting other popular brands, including the 
painkiller Midol, the antacid Phillips' Milk of Magnesia, Stri-dex acne 
treatments and Neo-synephrine nasal spray. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, the assets Bayer is acquiring through its Pittsburgh-based Miles 
Inc. subsidiary had 1993 earnings of $43 million on sales of $366 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Bayer has said previously that it wanted to expand its drug business in the 
important U.S. market. Last year, Bayer acquired a minority stake in Schein 
Pharmaceuticals, a large U.S. maker of generic drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 SmithKline said it will retain North American rights to Panadol, a non-aspirin 
painkiller sold in Canada, as well as the rest of Sterling's worldwide 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The British-based pharmaceutical company said the deal allows it to shed some 
drugs that overlap with existing lines. 
</P>
<P>
 SmithKline's existing brands include Tums antacid, Oxy brand acne treatments 
and Contac cold and flu medications. 
</P>
<P>
 SmithKline said it will use cash proceeds from the Bayer deal to pay off debt 
from its recent acquisition of Sterling.

 * A $200,000 homeowners insurance policy will reimburse you for up to $200,000 
in casualty losses. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you have $200,000 in casualty insurance and a $100,000 loss, you're

 You've probably guessed by now that the answer to all three questions is

the risk of being heavily penalized. This is a lesson that many homeowners in 
the San Fernando Valley learned the hard way after the Northridge earthquake 
Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 A simple example illustrates what coinsurance is all about. The Smiths have a 
home that would cost $125,000 to rebuild, but they have only $100,000 in 
casualty insurance. If the Smiths have an $80,000 casualty loss, many insurance 
policies will pay out just $64,000. The assumption is that the Smiths were 
self-insuring 20% of their residence by insuring just 80% of the cost of 
rebuilding their home. 
</P>
<P>
 "You may think that if you pay for a $100,000 policy that you are getting 
$100,000 in coverage. But that's not the way that it works," said Cindy Ossias, 
senior staff counsel at the California Department of Insurance. "Most companies 
have some sort of coinsurance penalty if the home is not insured up to a 
certain extent." 
</P>
<P>
 For many homeowners, that means "they're screwed in the event of a partial 
loss," Ossias warned. "If you only insure 80% of (a home's) replacement value, 
you are stuck with the other 20%." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Crystal, regional manager for the insurance industry's Western Insurance 
Information Service in Los Angeles, voiced little sympathy for people who are 
underinsured. "I can't imagine too many people opting to underinsure," she 
said. If homeowners have a loss that isn't fully covered, "they could have done 
something to prevent it." 
</P>
<P>
 But avoiding undercoverage is easier said than done because many policies are 
complex and difficult to decipher. "There's too much for the average person to 
understand," Ossias said. She and three other attorneys in her office recently 
reviewed her policy and had trouble making sense of it. "If we had these 
problems, how would a typical person get through it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ossias explained that there are three basic types of homeowner policies: 
</P>
<P>
 * Actual cash value policies pay out for losses based on the fair market value 
of the insured residence. This older type of coverage is particularly 
unattractive, Ossias said, because the policyholder may not get enough money to 
rebuild if the market is down. 
</P>
<P>
 * Replacement cost policies are most often associated with the coinsurance 
problem. Despite the name, the replacement value won't necessarily cover the 
cost of replacing a residence, Ossias said. If construction costs go up after a 
disaster that severely damages a home, for example, a policy might not cover 
those higher costs. 
</P>
<P>
 If you really want your home "replaced," you may have to insure for more than 
market value, Ossias said. For example, she has a property that would cost $1.2 
million to rebuild because of architectural details. The market value, however, 
is just $625,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Guaranteed replacement cost (GRC) policies provide for rebuilding or 
replacing a lost dwelling in "like kind and quality," no matter what the cost 
and regardless of policy limits. These policies help homeowners avoid the 
pitfalls of coinsurance. Don't be fooled by the word guarantee though. Some 
companies guarantee the replacement cost only if a property owner rebuilds and 
does not purchase a replacement dwelling. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, GRC will probably not cover the additional costs of replacing a 
structure under updated and more expensive building code requirements. Another 
caveat is that GRC policies guarantee costs only to a certain percentage. And 
not everyone is eligible for a GRC policy. Condominium residents or owners of 
homes that are of certain size or age may be ruled out of GRC coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what kind of insurance you have, calculating the value of anything 
can get sticky -- especially when it comes to estimating construction costs. 
The Department of Insurance warned consumers in October, 1993, that insurance 
companies often hire analysts who make estimates favoring the insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 What are some ways to avoid problems of coinsurance and underinsurance? 
</P>
<P>
 Make sure that your policy has an adequate inflation adjustment to account for 
increased replacement costs, advised Marsha Davis, a public affairs coordinator 
for State Farm in Westlake. She also suggested that homeowners get a checkup 
every year from their insurance agent to make sure that there is enough 
insurance to cover all possible losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Policyholders may also request extra coverage that pays for replacing a 
structure according to any new and more expensive building codes. Also, to get 
the best coverage, make sure that you have guaranteed replacement coverage not 
just for casualty to your residence, but also for the contents and in the event 
of an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said it also helps if homeowners do a pictorial inventory that 
accurately records the condition of the home that may need to be replaced in 
case of a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Some other things to keep in mind: 
</P>
<P>
 For casualty policies, deductibles are generally fixed; the industry standard 
for earthquake insurance is about 10%. There are companies that offer larger 
and smaller deductibles, depending on the needs and wants of the insurance 
purchaser. 
</P>
<P>
 It is vital to look at the way the deductible is calculated and applied by the 
insurance company. Losses that relate to the structure, landscaping or interior 
contents may not be lumped together for the purpose of calculating whether an 
insured has reached the 10% deductible. 
</P>
<P>
 Some policies also exclude from the deductible any damage sustained to masonry 
structures, such as block walls, brick veneer or chimneys. If the insured 
premises has multiple structures -- such as a home and an unattached garage -- 
there may be a separate deductible for each structure. This can be a rude 
surprise for many property owners who don't have what's known as a "blanket 
deductible." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 15 largest home insurers in Southern California, only three base their 
earthquake insurance rates on where a property is located, according to a study 
released in February by Consumers Union, the nonprofit organization that 
publishes Consumer Reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices for a $200,000 earthquake policy with a 10% deductible ranged from $231 
to $600 a year. So it pays to shop around. Keep in mind, however, that 
earthquake insurance generally must be purchased with standard insurance, and 
the package price will vary from one company to another. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to basic earthquake insurance, there is also extended coverage. 
The three most common forms are for structural engineering costs, demolition 
costs and reimbursement for any upgrades that need to be made to a damaged 
building because of upgraded ordinances. 
</P>

THE SOUP IS LOSING ITS FLAVOR; BASEBALL: AS A PALLIATIVE, THE DEADLINE TO 
CANCEL SEASON IS EXTENDED. BUT MORE THAN CHICKEN AND NOODLES IS NEEDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The 33rd day of the strike by major league players passed uneventfully Monday, 
with no contact between negotiators and no decision by acting commissioner Bud 
Selig to cancel the remainder of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 With no settlement in sight and no negotiations scheduled, that decision is 
still expected in the next 48 hours, probably Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt another couple of days hoping and trying is in everyone's best 
interest," Selig said on a conference call from Milwaukee. "It's like taking 
chicken soup when you have a cold. There's no proof that it helps, but what 
harm does it do? 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, I'm always an optimist, but I have to admit that we don't have a lot 
going for us, and that might be an exaggeration." 
</P>
<P>
 It's come down to chicken soup, and the union was finding it hard to swallow 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless and until the owners show a willingness to negotiate, there's nothing 
we can do," executive director Donald Fehr said Monday night after he and his 
staff spent four hours updating 27 player representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've made every effort, but there's been no reciprocity. It'll be tragic if 
the playoffs and World Series go down, but this has not been of the players' 
making." 
</P>
<P>
 He referred to the unwillingness of the owners to deviate from their salary 
cap proposal. He said there had been some indication from Boston Red Sox CEO 
John Harrington and Atlanta Brave president Stan Kasten on Saturday that the 
union would hear back from them on Monday, but it didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what his reaction was when he heard that the owners' negotiator, Richard 
Ravitch, attended the U.S. Open tennis tournament here on Saturday, and Selig 
spent part of Sunday at the Green Bay Packer-Miami Dolphin football game in 
Milwaukee, Fehr said: 
</P>
<P>
 "It occurred to me when I heard both of those things that they don't seem to 
care very much that they're giving the appearance that they have no interest in 
negotiating. I suggest that's probably because they have no interest in 
negotiating." 
</P>
<P>
 Selig said he attended only the first half of that game as guest of Wayne 
Huizenga, ownerof the Dolphins and Florida Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
 He bristled at the ongoing speculation about rifts among the 28 owners and 
said "we're well past the point where that should still be an issue. There 
should be no question about the owners' unanimity. Not one has dissented from 
the need for a new system that provides cost certainty."

ANALYSIS; RAIDERS NEED TO REGROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What happened? 
</P>
<P>
 How did the Raiders go from a team penciled in for a Super Bowl berth to a 
team being crossed off the list of contenders in one week? 
</P>
<P>
 From excellence to embarrassment. Were they ever that good? Are they really 
this bad? 
</P>
<P>
 Even Coach Art Shell conceded that "maybe I overrated the talent on this 
team." He added that he didn't believe he had, but others are not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Media representatives, football experts and coaches across the nation were 
touting a team that seemed to have filled all its needs in a busy off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with a suspect running game, they signed fullback Tom Rathman and 
tailback Harvey Williams, drafted Nebraska ballcarrier Calvin Jones and added 
huge offensive lineman Kevin Gogan. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with the retirement of defensive lineman Howie Long, they brought Scott 
Davis out of retirement and signed veteran Jerry Ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with questions about depth in their secondary, they signed veteran 
Albert Lewis, coming off one of his best seasons with the Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 It looked good on paper. But two games into the season -- games the Raiders 
have lost by a combined score of 82-23 -- that paper has been trashed. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, an 0-2 record is not sufficient reason to give up on a team. The Dallas 
Cowboys, for instance, were 0-2 last year and went on to have a pretty good 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 But they were without only one key player for those games, running back Emmitt 
Smith. The Raiders' problems run much deeper and, in fairness to the 
prognosticators, could not have been predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 For example: 
</P>
<P>
 -- No one knew during the summer of optimism that quarterback Jeff Hostetler 
would either injure his elbow, which appeared to be the case Sunday, although 
he denies it, or simply lose his touch. 
</P>
<P>
 He looked better on Monday in practice, making a few short throws with 
crispness. But without an effective running game, the Raiders will be lost 
without their quarterback. They built their offensive game plan on the fleet 
feet of the fastest receiving corps in the league. But without a strong arm to 
get them the ball, those receivers might as well join atrack team. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No one knew that Napoleon McCallum would suffer a season-ending knee injury 
in the opener. McCallum, though not blessed with great speed, had developed 
into an effective runner on short-yardage plays. He scored three touchdowns in 
the regular season last year in only 37 carries and added five more scores in 
two playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
 With Rathman to block for him, McCallum figured to get some more. Rathman has 
shown an ability to rush for touchdowns himself in the past, but who will block 
for him? 
</P>
<P>
 -- No one knew Davis would walk out on the team after the season opener, 
leaving a gaping hole in the defensive line. 
</P>
<P>
 None of those things could have been anticipated by the Raiders. Several other 
things, however, could be or could have been done. 
</P>
<P>
 They chose running back Williams, saying he could do the job. And maybe he 
could, if he ever got the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Raiders have stuck with Ty Montgomery, a converted wide receiver, 
as the starting tailback. Williams got only four carries against the San 
Francisco 49ers in the first game and only five in Sunday's loss to the Seattle 
Seahawks. It's hard to tell from that what he can do. 
</P>
<P>
 Give him the ball and let's find out. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing that Davis has left football unexpectedly twice before, the Raiders 
might have given themselves some insurance by keeping veteran Greg Townsend, 
rather than releasing him at the start of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 And they might have kept another veteran, middle linebacker Joe Kelly, rather 
than cutting him because of salary-cap considerations. Second-year man Greg 
Biekert has made big strides since last year and figures to get even better. 
But for now, the Raiders have a defense that has given up the most points in 
the league. 
</P>
<P>
 There are still 14 games to play. Plenty of time for the Raiders to get back 
to respectability if their quarterback is injury-free, if they find a tailback, 
if Davis comes back, if they get more help on the defensive line and if the 
huge number of penalties can be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a lot more ifs than there were seven days ago. But that was back when 
the name Raiders was followed by an exclamation mark rather than a question 
mark.

AT 5-10, HE ISN'T SHORT ON HEART; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: FULLBACK FORD OF WHITTIER 
WALKED OUT ON NEBRASKA, WALKED ON AT UCLA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 There he is, on page 76 of the Nebraska football media guide: Ford, Greg . . . 
RB . . . 5-10 . . . 235 . . . fr. . . . Whittier, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 And there, on page 30, under "Nebraska Football . . . Coast to Coast Talent." 
California. Whittier: Greg Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 But there he is, in the Bruin backfield against Southern Methodist, getting a 
first down on third and one, then leading Sharmon Shah through a hole Saturday 
night at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford was signed and sealed but won't be delivered to Nebraska as a walk-on 
fullback until this weekend. Instead, he was rerouted to UCLA, which 
accidentally discovered the backfield blocker it needed in its own neighborhood 
and will have him in Lincoln on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he was 6-3 or 6-4, he'd have -- how many Division I schools are there, 
106? -- offers," UCLA Coach Terry Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I know is that he's getting taller around here." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Ford is almost 5 feet 11, 255 pounds. The height alone was 
considered enough of a flaw to make the 30 or so schools that had sent him 
letters of inquiry run for cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when he showed extra quickness and strength as the state high school 
heavyweight wrestling champion, they stayed underground. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Nebraska was interested enough to bring him in for a recruiting visit, 
but that interest was tempered. There would be no scholarship, but the 
Cornhuskers would give him a uniform and let him become part of a walk-on 
tradition that has generated four of this season's starters and 28 of 80 
players on the depth chart. 
</P>
<P>
 It was enough for Ford, until UCLA assistant Mike Sherman came along. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman visited Whittier High in June to look at a tackle. At the time, UCLA 
sought a fullback to supplement the two converted tailbacks -- James Milliner 
and Daron Washington -- being used at the position. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was watching a high school film of next year's prospects and saw Greg Ford 
playing nose guard," Sherman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'He's a great-effort kid,' and the coach (Mike Fitch) talked about 
him, gave him a great recommendation and said he really wasn't going any place. 
I asked did he ever play fullback? Then he put another film on a goal-line 
situation. I saw him move the pile." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman called Donahue, and they invited Ford to drive over to Westwood. 
Ford's mother, Ann, a UCLA alumna, came along. With four brothers who'd played 
football -- one, George Buehler was the Oakland Raider right guard when the 
left side of the line, Gene Upshaw and Art Shell, was playing its way into the 
Hall of Fame; another, Jon, was a walk-on at USC, and Chuck played at Stanford 
-- she knew the right questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman introduced the Fords to Ed Kazarian, the academic liaison for the 
football program. Backfield coach Wayne Moses was called in. Then Donahue 
started selling. 
</P>
<P>
 He talked about the walk-ons who had gone on to fame at UCLA, of quarterback 
Rick Neuheisel, of wide receiver Mike Sherrard. And of the walk-on who stayed 
longest of all. A tackle, name of Terry Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
 It was worth thinking about, and they did for two weeks. A new NCAA rule was 
the clincher. 
</P>
<P>
 "At Nebraska, I wouldn't be one of the 105," said Ford. "At UCLA, I would." 
</P>
<P>
 A new rule mandates no more than 105 players -- scholarship and walk-on -- can 
practice before school starts. Ford was no closer than 106 at Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 "He couldn't have come here until Aug. 22," said George Darlington, the 
Nebraska assistant who recruits Southern California. "He was a nice youngster, 
and we were very disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 By Aug. 22, Nebraska was well into workouts, and Ford saw a road that was 
going uphill anyway turning into mountain climb. Donahue helped make that 
clearer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me I would be part of the 105 and come in with everyone else at 
UCLA," Ford said. "It's all I wanted. I just wanted an even chance, a shot at 
playing like everyone else was getting. If I couldn't play, at least I had the 
shot." 
</P>
<P>
 He also had more than a little luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of injuries, only Akil Davis, a 160-pound converted freshman wide 
receiver, and Ford were available on a scrimmage day, so Davis played tailback, 
running behind Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 For variety, Ford got to carry the ball occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington started getting more time at tailback after that, and Ford got 
plenty of time at fullback, where he is more of a sixth lineman than a 
ballcarrier. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't that he didn't want to carry the ball," Moses said. "But he's taken 
his position and made it the most important on the team to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Ford has helped, too. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 16 months older than Greg, 12 when the cancer was found. The brothers 
had fought and competed while growing up, but when Jon got sick, Greg stayed by 
his side. Others could play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day after school, I would be there, talking, watching TV, just messing 
around," Greg Ford said. "When he went into the hospital, after my mom got off 
from work, I would ask her to take me and I would stay, even if it was 1 in the 
morning." 
</P>
<P>
 When Jon Ford died, Greg Ford was so depressed that he blew up to 240 pounds, 
over a 5-6 frame. He was a 12-year-old who didn't like himself. It took years 
in the gym to fix that. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon both inspires him and helps him maintain perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think about him all the time," Ford said. "It's tough sometimes, but I have 
good memories. When I think football is tough, I think of him. It's nothing 
compared to fighting cancer for six months. I ask him to be with me every game. 
He's my strength." 
</P>
<P>
 It's one of the intangibles that Sherman refers to when he talks of Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a squatty-body kid," Sherman said. "It's hard to justify a recruiting 
trip for a guy like that. When you recruit kids, you recruit the outside mold. 
With a guy like Greg, you find the heart."

ITALIAN FANS SEEING RED; U.S. STAR DEFENDER LALAS A HIT AFTER BRINGING POPULAR 
ACT, MANE TO THE WORLD'S BEST SOCCER LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 History loped onto the field here late Sunday afternoon, entering a newly 
finished stadium in a crisp white uniform and curly red ponytail. The most 
improbable hero in Italian soccer was suddenly a long way from Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything Alexi Lalas does at this point makes history, as the first 
U.S.-born player to take the field in the 94 years of the Italian first 
division, considered the world's best professional soccer league. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the players bred in America, Lalas might be the most unlikely candidate 
to be playing in Italy. But after laboring in the safe cocoon of indifference 
that is soccer in the United States, the 24-year-old central defender has been 
heaved into a whirlwind, thanks to his unexpected stellar performance on the 
U.S. team in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 In the accelerating bandwagon of publicity -- which emphasized his 
soccer-rocker musician image, the player with the cascading red hair and Uncle 
Sam goatee -- Lalas' soccer skills were obscured. The fact that he played every 
minute during the U.S. team's World Cup campaign was obliterated. American 
sports fans could not tell you what position Lalas played but knew he played in 
a rock band. 
</P>
<P>
 The iconoclastic Lalas seems to have found a cosmic twin in Padova -- a 
sad-sack team that, with some luck and great effort, raised itself from the 
second to the first division at the end of last season. Ecstatic fans were 
delirious with the promotion and they flocked by the thousands Sunday to see 
the newly opened Stadio Euganeo, where Padova lost for the second time in as 
many games this season. Seemingly destined for the bottom of the league 
standings, the club is not expected to remain in the first division, even its 
most ardent fans say. 
</P>
<P>
 But everyone, including Lalas, is enjoying the ride and the fans are soft on 
the team that has brought world-class soccer to this university town 30 miles 
west of Venice. Fans remain proud and enthusiastic, united by their infatuation 
for the team's first foreign player. WELCOME TO EUROPE, NOW DROP DEAD 
</P>
<P>
 Lalas' first week in professional soccer went like this: A 5-0 drubbing by 
Sampdoria in Padova's season opener on Sept. 4. With the U.S. team three days 
later, a 2-0 loss to England at Wembley Stadium. And on Sunday, a 3-0 loss to 
Parma in Padova's first game in its new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 English reporters, in particular, have been lying in wait for Lalas since the 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 An ugly debate rages as two U.S. players wait for work permits to play in the 
English leagues. Several are already playing in England, barely tolerated, and 
there is a sense of impending invasion of "the home game" by burly American 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 Lalas' sin was in snubbing the English Premier League and going directly to 
the prestigious Italian first division, in which few English players have been 
able to make it. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Lalas played a sub-par game in Wembley and English writers feasted on his 
mistakes. The day after the game, newspapers rang with the chorus of 
I-told-you-so. 
</P>
<P>
 Columnist David Miller in the Times of London referred to Lalas as "a clumsy, 
top-heavy red lobster with ginger hair and purple shorts who was always 
arriving late when (Alan) Shearer received the ball. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "How the Italians would pay substantial money for Lalas defies the 
imagination." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rob Hughes' game story in the Times: "Lalas, the cult figure of America's 
high summer, was inept to say the least. . . . Lalas groped like an 
uncoordinated ostrich. . . . It made one wonder again how the guitar-plucking 
Lalas could have persuaded leading clubs in Europe that he was worth 500,000 
pounds for a one-year salary. It is ludicrous." 
</P>
<P>
 The public was no less welcoming. The crowd at Wembley offered Lalas a baptism 
by ire. Alone among the Americans, Lalas was lustily booed each time he touched 
the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, Lalas acknowledged that he had heard the jeers, but offered a 
typically philosophical response. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a professional athlete and they pay me for what I want to do," he said. 
"If being booed is the worst thing that ever happens to me, then that's all 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 Lalas is accustomed to being underappreciated. On his first day as a walk-on 
at Rutgers, he stood before the coach in a line with other freshmen. The coach 
walked down the line and ticked off the accomplishments of each player: 
"Three-time high school All-American. . . . Scored 119 goals in his career. . . 
. " When the coach got to Lalas, he paused and said, "He's from Michigan." 
</P>
<P>
 "I always think, 'Hey I really fooled them,' " Lalas said. "I'm the biggest 
con ever. They are going to give me a uniform? It was like that at Rutgers 
(where he won the Hermann Trophy in 1991), it was that way on the (1992) 
Olympic team. I've always had the I've-got-absolutely-nothing-to-lose attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I made the choice to go to Italy, I knew there were going to be people 
who said, 'This is incredible. I can't believe there is a team that's actually 
going to take a chance on him. Who do they think they are? I've been watching 
him for many years and he can't do anything and he's too slow and he doesn't 
have the skills.' I knew it was going to happen. And I (also) knew that there 
were a lot of people who believed in me and wanted me to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, when I came in, I wanted to be as humble as possible. And definitely not 
ride the summer's success. I wanted to prove to them that I knew what the hell 
I was doing." THE DUDE SHTICK 
</P>
<P>
 Because the American public could not comfortably grasp the esoteric details 
of his hydraulic jumping ability and appreciate the nuances of playing defense, 
fans instead latched onto Lalas' image. There was more information about his 
career as a musician than interest in his potential place on the World Cup 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 The attention lavished on Lalas and the U.S. World Cup team gave him some hint 
of what life must be like for soccer stars in the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a 24-year-old, growing up in the States, never to have soccer be what it 
is . . . " Lalas said. "People suddenly cared about what it is you did. For the 
first time in your life to be respected for what you did as a profession. I 
love that whole culture. I knew after it that I wanted to continue being in 
that. I wanted to go someplace where that could happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the phenomenon began in earnest, about a month before the start of the 
World Cup, Lalas was already a media favorite because of his provocative 
quotes. As more reporters began to cover the team, Lalas began to develop more 
of an image. Even as it was happening, he was aware of it and tried to maintain 
an honesty and not to become a caricature. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the States, we're so jaded," he said. "People are quick to pick up on 
things. Marketing and image-making -- that would totally ruin my credibility. I 
always try to be honest. For me, the most important thing was to project that I 
was having fun, because I was. And to do it with intelligence and humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd have these interviews where I could tell people wanted me to say dude and 
cowabunga. They wanted me to be the rock guy. I've had to make it up so much as 
I've gone along. It's not like we grew up watching other soccer players or saw 
how they have handled it. When you talk to so many different people and you try 
to come off as intelligent, a lot of the time you end up saying the same witty 
answer over and over again and trying to make it sound spontaneous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an American kid and I'm semi-intelligent and I know how it works, the 
image-making and all of that and what people grasp onto. I'm not naive in that 
sense." 
</P>
<P>
 What Lalas didn't know was how big it was all getting. 
</P>
<P>
 He went to the World Cup semifinal at the Rose Bowl as a spectator with his 
girlfriend, Jill McNeal. Outside the gates, he was besieged by fans and had to 
be extricated from the crowd by police. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really afraid," he said. "It was the first time it hit me. After the 
game, the police escorted us to my little car. And I thought, what has my life 
become? We had no idea how much we were out there and how much the American 
people picked up on us." HANGING OUT AT THE TOP 
</P>
<P>
 This week's goal is a fax machine. And getting the oven fixed. Every time it 
is turned on, the lights in the apartment go out. Those are McNeal's jobs and 
she has come up with a labor-frustration equation of 5-1: A task that would 
take one hour to complete in the United States takes five hours in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 When Lalas asked her to accompany him to Italy, McNeal didn't take long in 
quitting her job in Laguna Beach and joining Lalas in his new adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he had gone to the North Pole to play, I would have gone," she said. "The 
important thing is to be with him." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple presented a problem for Catholic Italians. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want us to be married," McNeal said. "No one wants to think we are 
living together. So, in the papers, I'm always referred to as Lalas' fiancee, 
or I'm just Jill. No one has yet to use my surname." 
</P>
<P>
 Lalas and McNeal are taking what comes here, much as Lalas has in his soccer 
career. Rather than moving into a large house in the country, as many teammates 
have, Lalas is renting a two-bedroom apartment close to the training facilities 
set in rolling green hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple has settled in and taken on all challenges with good humor and an 
unbridled optimism. Lalas is already wildly popular. His name is called out in 
the street. He signs autographs at his regular restaurant. Children like his 
exotic looks and adults admire his playing -- Lalas is considered one of the 
best players on the team -- and they respect his facility for the Italian 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now I'm playing in Serie A (the first division), and a year ago (World 
Cup Coach) Bora (Milutinovic) had us in a room watching tapes of it saying, 
'These are the best players in the world,' " Lalas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't be overwhelmed by it. I won't let myself be overwhelmed by it. It's 
one thing I've learned in traveling the world. Our sports view is so narrow. We 
are so arrogant. There's a lot going on in the world. I'm just confident, that 
without soccer, everything is going to be OK." 
</P>
<P>
 His experience as an overlooked player has helped mold Lalas' attitude. He 
knows many critics expect him to fail. He knows that many think he got his job 
because of his hair style. 
</P>
<P>
 What Lalas also knows is that, should he fail, he will always be the first 
American to have played at this level. He has learned that, often, to try is 
enough. To not fear failure is to be truly courageous. 
</P>
<P>
 "So you're going to walk on the moon," he said, shrugging, laughing. "If your 
spaceship breaks down, you don't go to the moon. You have to turn around and 
come back. People can say, 'You didn't walk on the moon.' But you went into 
space, man. It's perspective. That's the only thing that matters to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course I want to succeed. Of course I want to do well. But even if I fall 
flat on my face and I don't do well and people hate me, they say, 'This 
American can't play and he was a fluke this summer,' I could (not) care less. 
At least I tried it. And I was the first one. That's kind of cool, isn't it?"

JIM MURRAY: AT 61, THIS JOCKEY STILL RIDES DETERMINEDLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jockey Ray York, packing 120 pounds, finished last in a derby at Del Mar the 
other day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wait a minute!" you say. "Ray York? What kind of a time warp is this? Ray 
York hasn't been on a racetrack in 10 years. What is this, 1953?" 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Ray York wouldn't finish last on a rocking horse. He won the Kentucky 
Derby, no less. Not many jockeys can make that claim. Ray rode the great 
Determine in his best years.  
</P>
<P>
 Well, of course, the "derby" Saturday was the Del Mar Rocking Chair Derby, a 
kind of old-timers' game for retired jockeys. Not exactly a senior tour -- a 
one-shot go-round the track for race riders from another time or place.  
</P>
<P>
 York rode with the best of them. In his time, it was nothing for him to look 
up in the starting gate and see Willie Shoemaker on one side of him, Eddie 
Arcaro on the other and John Longden down a stall or two. Bill Hartack would be 
in the field. Even the great ones kept an eye on York when the flag dropped.  
</P>
<P>
 He won the Santa Anita Derby and then the Kentucky Derby on Determine in 1954. 
Determine, like his rider, was one of the most underrated figures in 
thoroughbred history. He was small, not particularly fast -- his Kentucky Derby 
on a fast track was run in 2:03. He was the first gray to win the Kentucky 
Derby. He was 900 pounds of pluck. He wasn't Willie Mays or Ty Cobb. He was 
more like Eddie Stanky or Pete Rose. All he did was beat you. 
</P>
<P>
 He ran an incredible 29 times in his 2-year-old and 3-year-old seasons. At 3, 
he ran 15 times, won 10 and was second three times and third twice. His owner, 
automobile dealer Andy Crevolin, would have run him down Wilshire Boulevard if 
the price and weight were right, other owners grumbled. He regularly gave eight 
to 10 pounds to the opposition.  
</P>
<P>
 He was not the first to parlay the Santa Anita Derby into the Kentucky. Hill 
Gail did that first. But Hill Gail was a Calumet horse slumming around the West 
Coast. Determine was as native as a surfer. 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't nominate him for the Triple Crown but the Preakness was won by 
Hasty Road that year, a horse Determine had run down in the stretch at 
Louisville even after being roughed at the start. The Belmont that year was won 
by High Gun by a neck over Fisherman, a colt Determine had beaten by 11 1/2 
lengths in Kentucky.  
</P>
<P>
 Ray York was the Determine of jockeys. You had him to beat. You got to the 
winner's circle through him.  
</P>
<P>
 He rode for 38 years but had his only other real shot at immortality in 1959 
when he rode the classy filly, Silver Spoon, to victory in the Santa Anita 
Derby. She became the first filly to run in the Kentucky Derby in 14 years -- 
and only five have run in the 35 years since. She ran fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was not disgraced," York recalls. "She was outrun. She made them beat 
her." 
</P>
<P>
 The reality of the track in those days was that York and his agent got to pick 
a horse only after Shoemaker, Longden or Arcaro got through with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was only one Bill Shoemaker," York acknowledges today. "There was 
Shoemaker, Longden -- and then there were the rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
 A result was, York had to win with the third and fourth choices. He did so -- 
3,080 times. He was second 2,910 times and third 2,740 times. He won one out of 
every nine races he rode. If he has a regret, it is that it wasn't more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have won twice as many races," he confides ruefully. "I drank. 
</P>
<P>
 "It cost me races. It cost me mounts. I could have won 6,000 races as I look 
back on it. I got to messing around and drinking. Cost me two marriages. Might 
have cost me a couple of Kentucky derbies." 
</P>
<P>
 Winning one Kentucky Derby has been advantageous enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can go somewhere and say you were a race rider and they just nod and look 
away. But you say, 'I won the Kentucky Derby in 1954,' and they say, 'Oh, you 
won the Kentucky Derby!' Now they know you were a race rider." 
</P>
<P>
 Many great riders never have won one -- Laverne Fator, Sandy Hawley, Johnny 
Adams, Manny Ycaza, Sonny Workman, Ralph Neves. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got to get that one horse," York says. 
</P>
<P>
 So, at 61, Ray York was back on a racehorse at Del Mar last weekend. As usual, 
it was not the best horse in the race. And it was not Determine.  
</P>
<P>
 But it was no bridle path canter. These easy riders moved the 5 1/2 furlongs 
in 1:03.4. The track record is 1:02.1.  
</P>
<P>
 They all stayed on. They whipped and slashed and pumped as if it were the 
first Saturday in May at Churchill Downs.  
</P>
<P>
 Longden and Shoemaker were there, but for them it really was a rocking chair 
event. Trainer Shoemaker, of course, is in a wheelchair, the result of a 
traffic accident, and Longden did not ride. 
</P>
<P>
 It was of Longden, though, that York, at a testimonial, once said, "He was 
rough competition. You could get to him. You couldn't get by him." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, if Ray York had the horse under him -- and the bottle corked -- you 
couldn't even get to him.

JUDGE UPHOLDS THREE RICH NBA CONTRACTS; PRO BASKETBALL: LEAGUE HAD SAID DEALS 
FOR GREEN, DUDLEY AND KUKOC CIRCUMVENTED SALARY CAP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the NBA, this will be remembered as the summer everyone sued everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 In its latest case, the league, determined to close the loophole in its salary 
cap, went to court against four players, lost three of the cases, got no ruling 
in the fourth but claimed "a very important victory." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Dickinson Debevoise upheld the contracts of the Phoenix 
Suns' A.C. Green, the Portland Trail Blazers' Chris Dudley and the Chicago 
Bulls' Toni Kukoc after a 90-minute hearing Monday in Newark, N.J. Dickinson 
rejected the NBA's claim that the lucrative contracts -- each signed after the 
player was given a one-year termination clause in his earlier contract -- 
circumvented the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Debevoise didn't rule in the case of Horace Grant, the former Bull who was 
signed by the Orlando Magic. His contract also was struck down by the league. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant's deal is the most closely watched because it tilts the balance of power 
in the Eastern Conference. With Grant, a top power forward, the Magic would be 
a division favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant's attorneys said they will seek an immediate hearing. Magic officials 
said if the judge found a problem with this contract, they would write another 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 That was as close as the league came to winning anything Monday, but NBA 
officials claimed to be pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have to show in each case the contract is a circumvention of the 
cap," said Jeffrey Mishkin, senior vice president for legal and business 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "All new contracts can now be challenged. We think this is a very important 
victory for the NBA." 
</P>
<P>
 Salary cap rules limit teams' offers to free agents but allow teams to pay 
anything to their own players who are eligible for free agency. This is the 
defining feature of the NBA's "soft cap," which differs from the NFL's more 
restrictive "hard cap." 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, however, NBA teams began getting around the restrictions by 
signing free agents with whatever money was available -- but giving their new 
players "one-year outs," making them free agents again in a year when the teams 
could offer them anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has become a standard operating procedure on behalf of teams signing 
free agents who are looking to change teams," NBA attorney Howard Ganz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dudley, a Net, turned down a $3-million-a-year offer from New Jersey to take a 
$1.5-million deal in Portland. When the NBA sued, Dudley said in court that he 
was choosing Portland for its lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, when Dudley triggered his "out" clause and became a free agent 
again, the Trail Blazers signed him to a $4-million-a-year deal. Even though 
this confirmed what the NBA had predicted would happen, the league was unable 
to demonstrate in court that its cap had been circumvented. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Green, the former Laker, got a new contract in Phoenix for $5.2 
million a year -- a $2.2-million raise. 
</P>
<P>
 Kukoc, the European star who was paid $1.5 million by the Bulls in his first 
season, will make $4.1 million this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Grant's deal was not immediately upheld. He turned down a $4-million 
offer in Chicago to accept $3.7 million in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 The salary-cap issue is expected to be resolved in collective bargaining, but 
that isn't going well, either. 
</P>
<P>
 The players' contract expired at the end of last season and there have been no 
new negotiations. Instead, the players association sued to have the present 
rules thrown out, was defeated in court and has appealed. The appeal is 
scheduled to be heard Sept. 22.

PLEA BARGAIN PROPOSED FOR COOPER THAT WOULD DEFER ANY JAIL SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As part of a proposed plea bargain, Michael Cooper would plead guilty to 
assault and battery on his wife and receive a deferred sentence while 
continuing counseling for six months, prosecutor Michelle Frechette said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper's appearance before Municipal Judge Arnold Padilla was postponed Monday 
until Oct. 17 so Frechette could work out details of the plea agreement she has 
reached with Cooper's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, a Laker assistant coach and former Laker player, was arrested after a 
dispute with his wife July 27 at the couple's Corrales home. Cooper, who is 
free on $400 bond, entered inpatient counseling last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Frechette said Padilla will have final say on the plea agreement.  
</P>
<P>
 If Padilla accepts the agreement, Cooper will plead guilty to the assault and 
battery charge and receive a six-month sentencing deferral. The petty 
misdemeanor carries a maximum penalty upon conviction of a $500 fine and up to 
179 days in jail.

NFL PLAYERS SHARE IN A $30-MILLION SETTLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 1,300 professional football players will share in a record $30-million 
settlement of charges arising from the 24-day NFL strike in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Labor Relations Board said Monday the agreement between the NFL 
Players Assn. and the NFL Management Council is the largest such award in NLRB 
history. The settlement includes back pay, incentive bonuses and interest. 
</P>
<P>
 A breakdown of how much players from each of the 28 teams would receive was 
not available Monday, but the agency said distribution of the award was 
expected within a couple of months. The NLRB said further details are to be 
announced at a news conference today. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate reaction from the players association. 
</P>
<P>
 But the management council attempted to play down the settlement, saying the 
award was "part of the $195-million overall settlement that the NFL reached 
with its players' union in January 1993." 
</P>
<P>
 After receiving a complaint from the NFLPA, the NLRB had ruled the council and 
NFL teams had unlawfully refused to allow returning players to participate in 
games immediately after the end of the strike Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board found that the denial of the returning strikers the right to play 
or be paid, as well as other acts by league management such as withholding game 
checks for certain injured-reserve players, constituted unfair labor practices 
in violation of the National Labor Relations Act," NLRB general counsel Fred 
Feinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the NLRB upheld the initial ruling by an administrative law judge, the 
team owners appealed to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia, which had the decision under review. 
</P>
<P>
 "This settlement would obviate the need for any additional proceedings before 
the circuit court," said David Parker, the NLRB director of information. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike began Sept. 22 after the NFLPA and management were unable to agree 
on several issues, including free agency.

STRIKE CAUSES ANGELS TO ELIMINATE ARIZONA INSTRUCTIONAL LEAGUE TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels said they will not participate in the upcoming instructional league 
in Arizona because of financial reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement by Ken Forsch, the Angels' director of minor league 
operations, means the team will not be a part of the Arizona Instructional 
League program for the first time since 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just financial," Forsch said. "It's a big cash outlay. You're looking at 
$110,000 to $120,000 for six weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels' youngest minor-league players, those taken in the 1994 draft and 
who had played at either the Class A or rookie league level, were expected to 
attend. The Angels are the 13th team that has said it won't participate in an 
instructional league. 
</P>
<P>
 "During these difficult times, we feel our people are more important than 
programs," Angel President Richard M. Brown said in a statement. "From the 
outset of the players' strike, unlike some other clubs, we pulled our scouts 
off the road. We believe foregoing our participation in the instructional 
league shouldn't be any different."

RAMS' OFFENSE HAS ITS SHARE OF PROBLEMS; PRO FOOTBALL: MILLER IS 26TH IN 
PASSING EFFICIENCY, TIGHT END DRAYTON COMPLAINS ABOUT HIS DIMINISHED ROLE AND 
GUARD LONEKER IS SIDELINED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quarterback Chris Miller had begun addressing the state of the Rams' offense 
on Monday when tailback Jerome Bettis passed by, clutching his lower back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, no, my back," Bettis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just kidding," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 That's hardly what a struggling Ram offense would need -- an injured Bettis -- 
after rolling up 421 yards but scoring only 13 points in Sunday's loss to the 
Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
 And although his back is fine, Bettis' left wrist was heavily taped. It had 
been injured on a tackle but it was no reason to panic, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The doctors just wanted me to put this on so I could work out," said Bettis, 
whose 154 yards rushing rank second in the NFC to the 261 by Dallas' Emmitt 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was sore Sunday night, but they wanted me to put this on as a 
precautionary measure so I could lift weights." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis said the sore wrist won't affect his preparation for Sunday's game 
against the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers come to town with a seven-game winning streak against the Rams, who 
can hardly afford any more setbacks in an offense that already has more than 
its share of problems: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Miller has completed only 44.4% of his passes with one touchdown and four 
interceptions and has dropped to 26th in the NFL passing ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tight end Troy Drayton, who has yet to catch a pass in two regular-season 
games, is complaining that he's not part of the offense. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Coach Chuck Knox said that starting left guard Keith Loneker, who is 
expected to undergo surgery on his fallen left arch, will be put on injured 
reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams rank 20th in the NFL in total offense with an average of 286.5 yards, 
and on Sunday failed to score from the Falcon one on three runs up the middle 
by Bettis. 
</P>
<P>
 The offensive line was penalized seven times for 55 yards, twice for holding 
by right guard Leo Goeas and another time for holding by Drayton. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a big imbalance between the number of holding calls on Atlanta and 
called on us," Knox said. "It's just one of those things that you have to put 
up with." 
</P>
<P>
 Drayton, a third-round draft pick last year, complained after Sunday's game 
that he wasn't getting the ball enough and that he wasn't sure of his role. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't imagine how I feel right now," Drayton said. "Coming into the 
season, I thought I was going to be a big part of this offense. Now, I don't 
know what my status is." 
</P>
<P>
 Told of Drayton's frustration, Knox said, "He ought to be frustrated that we 
didn't win." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox then added, "Obviously, you want to get the ball to the tight end because 
this is a guy who can do something with it once he gets it." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox said the Rams tried twice to throw to Drayton in the season-opening 
victory over Arizona. Sunday, Drayton was open inside Atlanta's 15-yard line, 
but Miller overthrew him and D.J. Johnson intercepted at the Falcons' four. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do need to do a better job of getting Troy the ball," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The better he gets at route recognition and those types of things, he will 
open up more and get involved like he needs to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, signed by the Rams in the off-season, didn't have a tight end for the 
seven seasons he ran Atlanta's run-and-shoot offense. The Rams also pull 
Drayton off the field when they use their four-wide receiver formation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true, we haven't directed too many routes to the tight end," Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But a lot of the time, he's not in there."

1994 PREP PREVIEW: GIRLS' TENNIS; CRYING GAME A TURNING POINT FOR LAGUNA 
BEACH'S BRAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michelle Bray had played hundreds of tennis matches in her life, so she was 
used to a temperamental opponent shedding a tear occasionally during a match. 
</P>
<P>
 Bray, a junior at Laguna Beach High, didn't think much of it when her 
opponent, Holly Parkinson of Miami, began crying during the first set of their 
match this summer at the girls' 16s national hardcourts in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured it was because she was losing," Bray said. 
</P>
<P>
 But then after losing the first set to Bray, Parkinson came back to take the 
next set. Parkinson also was winning the third set and was on the verge of 
putting Bray away, but she was still crying. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Bray was spooked. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was weird because this girl was crying and she was beating me," Bray said. 
"It caught me off guard. I tried to put pressure on her, but it was hard 
because she was crying on almost every point. I started to feel sorry for her." 
</P>
<P>
 Bray wound up losing to Parkinson in three sets and eventually found out that 
Parkinson had been grieving over the recent death of her grandmother. 
Afterward, Bray realized the strangest thing about the match was that she was 
in it at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Parkinson was the nation's fifth-ranked player in the girls' 16s division, and 
Bray was not even ranked in the top 100. Bray had never qualified for a 
national junior tournament until this year when she played the clay courts and 
hardcourts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I started talking to people, they started saying, 'Gosh, you should be 
happy how well you did," ' Bray said. "But with the way the match ended after I 
had the lead, I was disappointed. It was definitely a learning experience." 
</P>
<P>
 It was an experience that Bray's coach, Sam Olson, never figured Bray would 
have at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple years ago, she wouldn't have been able to stay on the same court 
with a girl like that," said Olson, who teaches at the Balboa Bay Racquet Club. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple years ago, Olson didn't even see Bray as a tennis player. Now, she's 
one of the top high school players in Orange County for the upcoming season. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first met her, I didn't think she'd be that hard of a worker," Olson 
said. "She not a real big girl. She doesn't look like your typical tennis 
player." 
</P>
<P>
 But Olson said Bray has proved him wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes she's out here working on her own until 8:30 at night," Olson said. 
"I've told her it's all right to go out with your friends once in a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Walton, Bray's high school coach, also respects Bray for her work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
 "She takes her No. 1 position on this team seriously," Walton said. "One day 
in practice we were playing a game called 'around the world.' Some of the kids 
were playing around and not taking it seriously. But Michelle decided that 
since she was the No. 1 player on the team, she wasn't going to lose to anyone. 
She wound up beating everyone and winning the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Walton expects Bray will win a lot of games this season for the Artists, the 
two-time defending Southern Section Division II champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's hitting the ball a lot harder now and she's coming to the net more," 
Walton said. "You have to beat her. She's not going to beat herself." 
</P>
<P>
 As she continues to mature, Olson said Bray will start beating opponents that 
used to beat her. 
</P>
<P>
 Bray said she owes a lot of her new-found confidence to Olson, who has worked 
with Bray for nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I owe my game to him," she said. "He knows everything about the game. You 
could hit one shot and off of that he knows exactly what to tell you. I can 
talk to him about anything and I totally respect the advice he gives me." 
</P>
<P>
 Olson said Bray will start getting more respect as she continues to improve 
her power game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her body size and strength still hurt her against the good players because 
she'd not able to get the power behind the ball like the bigger girls do," 
Olson said. "But on the other hand, she's quicker than most girls she plays and 
she's got great footwork. Being left-handed doesn't hurt either. Not many 
juniors are used to the ball coming from that angle." 
</P>
<P>
 And probably not many high school opponents will be used to Bray's drastically 
improved game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely have more confidence now," Bray said. "It's just a mind game 
really. I've improved a lot in physical aspect but mentally too." Girls' Tennis

University, and the return of Westerman and three key doubles players. . . 
Mission Viejo hasn't won a South Coast League match in four years, but it might 
have the smartest and most musical team around. Coach Bill Smith said his team 
will have a grade-point average in excess of 4.0 and senior Stephanie Wan is a 
concert violinist.

DEL MAR; INDICATORS POINT TO BREEDERS' CUP BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buoyed by a meeting during which average total handle and track attendance 
took significant upturns, the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club is looking at the 
possibility of holding the Breeders' Cup races in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been having preliminary discussions," said Joe Harper, president and 
general manager. "But there are still things which need to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Breeders' Cup day is national in scope, the hurdles Del Mar must 
overcome are much closer to home, Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The starting points are Santa Anita and the California Horse Racing Board," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper's preliminary discussions have focused on how to cope with the fact 
that the Breeders' Cup is run in early November, when Santa Anita has the 
racing dates in Southern California. He has talked to both Santa Anita and the 
CHRB about how this obstacle might be overcome, such as swapping racing dates 
for that season. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot to do, but this would be a great place for the Breeders' Cup," 
Harper said. "The location is nice. There are tons of new hotels in the area. 
There are things to do. And we have a lot of VIP space here at the track, such 
as luxury and sky boxes and a large Turf Club." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday marks the end of Del Mar's second meeting since the completion of an 
$81-million project that was as much a rebuilding as a renovation. Seating was 
expanded to 14,000 and Harper said more seating, particularly box seating, is 
being added each year. Seating capacity, he said, could be temporarily boosted 
to 20,000 for a Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the weekend's racing, Del Mar's average daily track attendance was up 
8.8% and average total handle, including off-track, was up 23.4%. The biggest 
increase in terms of handle was a 55.6% jump in out-of-state handle, mainly 
because of additional outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 It would seem surprising, therefore, that on-track handle was down 1.1% and 
per capita track betting was down 5.8%.  
</P>
<P>
 "On-track attendance reflects the health of the game to me," Harper said. "It 
means our promotions are working and we're getting new players. New players 
don't bet as much and that shows in per capita being down. That's fine. We want 
the new faces." 
</P>
<P>
 Del Mar tried a number of first-time promotional events, such as "Wild 
Fridays" with rock bands, the Fiesta Del Mar with a Latin theme, a cap giveaway 
that led to a record-breaking opening-day crowd of 34,697, jockey camera days 
and one Friday twilight program, at which attendance increased 50% over 
previous comparable dates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd be nuts not to try that again," Harper said. "Our biggest enemy here is 
sundown, so we'd have to do it early in the season. Maybe nine races the first 
Friday, eight the second and seven the third." 
</P>
<P>
 Sundown will be an enemy Wednesday when Del Mar closes the meeting with a 
10-race card. Any extraordinary delay earlier in the card would bring the sun 
down before the meet actually ends. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Dominique, ridden by Patrick Valenzuela, made her move at the top of the 
stretch and held off 2-5 favorite Phone Chatter in winning Monday's Vieille 
Vigne Handicap. . . . Sal Gonzales Jr., the nation's top apprentice rider last 
year, has left Del Mar and will resume riding at Turfway Park in Florence, Ky. 
. . . Laffit Pincay Jr. will be honored in his native Panama on Sunday. 
Accompanying him will be fellow jockeys Alex Solis, Martin Pedroza, Kent 
Desormeaux, Chris Antley, Jacinto Vasquez, Walter Guerra and Jorge Velasquez.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Maryland Gov. William Donald Schaefer probably will meet with Ram officials 
during an economic development trip to California that will begin Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore Oriole owner Peter G. Angelos, who is heading a group interested in 
bringing the team to Baltimore, also is expected to be in Los Angeles at the 
end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, Schaefer, who has made the return of the NFL to Baltimore a top 
priority in the remaining days of his administration, declined to comment on 
the Rams. "As far as I know, I'm going to meet the Disney people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Wasserman, secretary of the state's Department of Economic and Employment 
Development, said the purpose of the trip is to boost the state's film and 
television business. He said he was unaware of any plans to meet with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been in the planning for a long time," he said of the entertainment 
industry effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But another source familiar with the governor's plans said a Rams visit was in 
the planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Heidi Sinclair, a spokeswoman for Ram President John Shaw, also said a 
courtesy meeting between Schaefer and Shaw was under discussion. "It appears 
that it is going to take place," she said.

BIG CUTS AT AEROSPACE GIANT; FULLERTON BIDS FAREWELL TO A FRIEND; HISTORY: 
FORMER EMPLOYEES RECALL THE POSTWAR 'GLORY YEARS,' WHEN HUGHES WAS THE CITY AND 
THE CITY WAS HUGHES.

 It was built on 350 acres in the gently sloping hills of Fullerton. With its 
broad lawns and stands of towering trees, the sprawling Hughes Aircraft 
aerospace complex looks more like a college campus than an industrial outpost 
of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 But they built air defense systems there. And anti-submarine systems. And 
battlefield radar. 
</P>
<P>
 During its 37-year history, the Hughes Fullerton operation earned a reputation 
as the world's preeminent supplier of air defense systems and as one of the 
leading makers of surface and anti-submarine systems for the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the boom times ended long before the fall of the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's announcement Monday that it will in effect shut down its massive 
facility over the next two years and that most of its 6,800 employees will be 
either transferred or laid off brings Hughes' long and distinguished time in 
Fullerton to a close. 
</P>
<P>
 The glory years have turned to anxious moments for current workers and a time 
of reflection for former employees who remember working at Hughes when Orange 
County aerospace was king. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was fantastic," says Ray Turner of La Habra, 65, who retired from Hughes 
last year after 24 years, adding, "It's a shame it had to end like this." 
</P>
<P>
 The eventual closing of the Hughes plant, for nearly four decades the city's 
largest employer, will end a significant chapter in the history of Fullerton, 
where the company has played a key role not only in the city's economy but in 
the community at large. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hughes is Fullerton, and Fullerton is Hughes," Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin has 
said more than once. 
</P>
<P>
 "Howard saw the need for acquiring land and he saw opportunity," Catlin says, 
referring to the company's legendary founder, Howard Hughes. "He made a good 
land deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Welds, a personnel manager for Hughes Aircraft from 1954 to his 
retirement in 1978, says: "They claimed Howard Hughes never put his feet in 
Fullerton. But he flew over it. And he said, 'Well, it's not a bad spot there.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 The story of Hughes Aircraft in Fullerton is part of the larger one played out 
by the aerospace industry as it shaped Orange County in the post-World War II 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles-based Hughes Aircraft decided to move to Fullerton because of its 
success in the early 1950s with building avionics packages for Air Force 
fighters -- essentially airborne radar, cockpit computers and displays and 
radar-guided missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes chose Fullerton primarily because it offered open land that would allow 
the company to test its outdoor radar equipment without interfering with 
neighbors' TVs and other electronic devices. (All testing is now done indoors.) 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas Begovich, 72, remembers that hot June day in 1957 when he and about 
200 other Hughes workers from throughout Southern California opened the doors 
of the company's newest division: a pair of small stucco buildings next to 
Fullerton Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had the whole world to show our wares," says Begovich. 
</P>
<P>
 Within two years, Hughes' Fullerton operations had moved to state-of-the art 
labs and offices perched at the top of the area known as Sunny Hills, and it 
was indeed on the world stage. The division soon won a $400-million contract -- 
then the largest in Hughes Aircraft's history -- to develop NATO's air defense 
system for Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 The good times for Hughes workers began to sour in the 1970s. With major 
defense cuts in 1970, the aerospace industry experienced a dramatic downturn 
and the Hughes' Fullerton plant was hit as hard as anyone -- 3,000 of its 8,000 
employees were laid off. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the late 1970s, the plant landed a series of international air defense 
contracts, which offset its dismal opportunities in the United States. Defense 
spending remained relatively low until the 1980s buildup begun during the 
Reagan Administration, and by 1986, Hughes' employee roster had swollen to a 
record 14,500. But shortly thereafter, the company began to cut back.FULLERTON

BIG CUTS AT AEROSPACE GIANT; HUGHES TO TRIM 4,400 JOBS; DEFENSE: LAYOFFS WILL 
CLOSE NEARLY ALL OF THE FULLERTON PLANT. CUTS WILL ALSO BE MADE IN EL SEGUNDO, 
LONG BEACH AND SANTA BARBARA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hughes Aircraft Co., delivering a severe reminder that painful aerospace 
cutbacks in California are far from over, said Monday that it will lay off 
another 4,400 defense electronics workers in Southern California and close 
virtually all of its sprawling plant in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 The layoffs will occur over the next 16 months at the Fullerton site, which 
now employs 6,800, and in El Segundo, where Hughes has 7,800 workers, along 
with some of Hughes' smaller defense systems plants, such as Long Beach and 
Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 "All defense locations will be affected," said Hughes Chairman C. Michael 
Armstrong. The plants make such products as ship-based radar gear, air defense 
systems and commercial air traffic control equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The precise number of layoffs at each location will largely depend on how many 
people working in Fullerton are transferred elsewhere, retire or resign, the 
company said. About 700 employees will remain in Fullerton in leased buildings, 
Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's chaos here today, and nobody's working," Doug Erickson, 35, a Hughes 
engineer in Fullerton, said after the announcement. Erickson said he expects to 
be offered a transfer to El Segundo, but added, "I really don't want to go." 
</P>
<P>
 The layoffs alone represent 9% of Hughes' worldwide work force of 51,000, and 
are expected to deal a major blow to portions of Orange County, where Hughes is 
one of the largest centers of industrial employment. Hughes employs 34,000 in 
California overall. 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles-based Hughes is still saddled with far more factory capacity 
than it needs because of the slide in defense spending, even though it has 
already slashed more than 10,000 jobs in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said flatly that it must slim down further to survive the 
post-Cold War era. "People keep asking when this is going to be over," 
Armstrong said in a phone interview. "It's going to be over when the defense 
budget stabilizes and our costs are competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1990s, Hughes consolidated its missile production -- which had 
been spread among several sites in California and elsewhere -- into one plant 
in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Southern California accounted for such a large part of the 
defense industry's buildup in the 1980s "now is the reason why Southern 
California is bearing such a brunt in the downsizing," Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, analysts said Hughes' announcement won't be the last in California. 
"We're about two-thirds of the way through this downsizing," said Nancy Bolton, 
an analyst with the UCLA Business Forecasting Project. 
</P>
<P>
 Her group estimates that another 60,000 aerospace workers statewide will be 
laid off by the end of 1996 -- when California's total aerospace employment 
will drop to about 131,000, or a third of its peak of 383,000 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Those figures don't include additional jobs that are lost at parts makers, 
restaurants and other suppliers whose business suffers because of the aerospace 
industry's slump -- what economists call the "multiplier effect." 
</P>
<P>
 Taken together, the additional aerospace-related cuts also won't help 
California's anemic economic recovery, though some analysts said the rest of 
the state's economy is trying to overcome the industry's severe contraction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most industries outside of aerospace are recovering," said Ted Gibson, 
principal economist with the state Department of Finance. He also estimated 
that by 1997-98, the defense and commercial aerospace industries will be slowly 
expanding again. 
</P>
<P>
 Some economists also said the latest Hughes job losses and transfers may not 
be all that important to the overall Southern California economy. But that's no 
consolation to the communities directly hit by Hughes' announcement Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 "Locally, this is going to have significant impacts," said Jack Kyser, chief 
economist of the Economic Development Corp. of Los Angeles County. "All of the 
businesses in the area will feel it." 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement capped months of speculation for anxious Hughes workers and 
nearby businesses. Hughes, part of GM Hughes Electronics Corp., which in turn 
is a unit of General Motors Corp., had said in May that it was studying how to 
consolidate its defense-electronics work. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes said it needed to eliminate about 3 million square feet of 
manufacturing and office space -- most which would be accomplished by closing 
the 350-acre Fullerton plant. Hughes expects to sell 286 acres of the site, 
while keeping 64 acres for parking and two office buildings that the company 
will continue leasing. 
</P>
<P>
 (Hughes' headquarters in Los Angeles and its satellite and communications 
plants in El Segundo are not involved in this consolidation.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton plant opened in 1957 and employed as many as 14,500 people in 
1986. The site is expected to fetch more than $75 million in one or more sales. 
Hughes reportedly has been quietly shopping portions of the site to home 
builders. 
</P>
<P>
 The consolidation stemmed from Hughes' formation of a new subsidiary in March 
called Hughes Aerospace & Electronics Co. That move merged the firm's 
aerospace, defense, missile and systems groups. The unit, which accounted for 
nearly $7 billion of GMHE's $13.5 billion in sales last year, will be based in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong traveled to Fullerton to make the announcement Monday morning to 
more than 25,000 Hughes workers, both via a closed-circuit television broadcast 
and in personal meetings with groups of employees. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interview, Armstrong said California's costly business climate played 
no role in Hughes' decision, because there is nothing the state can do to 
prevent the defense industry's shrinkage. 
</P>
<P>
 But he repeated a favorite theme that California must keep improving 
conditions if it hopes to attract new investment in other industries. Armstrong 
noted that recent changes in workers' compensation rules and other regulatory 
relief in California contributed to Hughes' decision to invest in a cellular 
telephone plant in San Diego and an electric-vehicle parts facility in 
Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 "My hope is that after the elections (in November), California will continue 
changing to be more competitive, so those initial investments can become large 
investments," he said.

 Times staff writers Don Lee, Ross Kerber, John O'Dell and Debora Vrana in 
Orange County contributed to this reporter. Job Upheavals at Hughes 
</P>
<P>
 At its peak in the mid-1980s, Hughes Aircraft Co. had about 82,000 employees 
involved in aerospace. Today, the number has dwindled to about 51,000 workers. 
Here's a look at which plants remain open after the latest round of closings: 
</P>
<P>
 * El Segundo: Employs about 7,800 people to build lasers, night vision 
equipment and radar sets for fighter aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tucson: More than 7,400 workers at this facility build tactical anti-tank 
and anti-aircraft missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tijuana: Some 200 employees assemble electronic wiring harnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 * Santa Barbara: About 1,450 workers build infra-red detector arrays and space 
sensors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Long Beach: About 975 employees provide technical field support for various 
military hardware such as tactical missiles, communications systems and 
ground-based radar. 
</P>
<P>
 These plants have already closed or will soon: 
</P>
<P>
 * Fullerton: Has about 6,800 employees and will phase out most operations by 
the end of 1995, displacing about 6,000 people. Two small buildings will remain 
with between 700 and 1,000 employees to develop and build command and control 
systems and air traffic control systems. 
</P>
<P>
 * Canoga Park: Had about 1,900 workers. Announced in June, 1992 that the plant 
would shut down by Oct. 6, 1994. The facility was the headquarters and 
engineering center for missile systems group employees, which have since 
transferred to Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 * San Diego: Had 2,500 employees. Was an Unmanned Strike Systems division 
which made the Tomahawk and advanced cruise missile. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pomona: Had 2,400 workers. Air Defense Systems division which made the 
Standard missile and Phalanx gun system. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rancho Cucamonga: Had 1,500 workers. Air Defense Systems division which made 
the Stinger and the Rolling Airframe missile. 
</P>
<P>
 Note: The San Diego, Pomona and Rancho Cucamonga operations were acquired from 
General Dynamics in August, 1992, and were transferred to Tucson by the end of 
1993.

GROCERY MOGUL'S COMEUPPANCE ONLY PUSHED HIM HIGHER; PROFILE: RON BURKLE'S 
FIRING EARLY IN HIS CAREER LED HIM TO BUILD THE FOOD 4 LESS EMPIRE THAT STANDS 
READY TO ACQUIRE RALPHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The turning point came in 1981 when Ron Burkle -- then a vice president at the 
Stater Bros. supermarket chain at the tender age of 29 -- decided to put 
together a buyout team and raise money to acquire his employer. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Petrolane Properties, owner of Stater Bros. at the time, was 
entertaining offers to buy its supermarket chain, the parent company was not 
entertained by Burkle's offer. Burkle offered about 20% less than Petrolane's 
investment banker sought and -- in a resulting dispute over the value of the 
company -- Burkle was fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that incident, Burkle has made enough successful buyout bids to build a 
grocery chain empire that comprises Food 4 Less Supermarkets -- the La 
Habra-based operator of the Alpha Beta, Boys and Viva chains and the Food 4 
Less warehouse stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most people would like to be entrepreneurial, but most don't want to 
give up the security," said Burkle, recalling the Stater Bros. firing. "That 
incident was the push I needed to do something on my own." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Burkle is on the verge of completing what could be his biggest deal -- a 
highly anticipated buyout that would lead to the merger of Food 4 Less 
Supermarkets and Ralphs Grocery Co. The parent of Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Los 
Angeles-based Yucaipa Cos., is expected to announce a $2.5-billion merger with 
Ralphs today. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the deal, Yucaipa -- an investment company that Burkle heads -- is to 
acquire Ralphs from DeBartolo Corp., an Ohio-based real estate development firm 
that has controlling interest in the supermarket chain. The boards of Ralphs 
and Food 4 Less Supermarkets have already approved the merger. The deal is to 
be finalized today if Ralphs shareholders also agree. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Ralphs merger loomed Monday, Burkle, now 41, recalled the Stater Bros. 
dismissal. To Burkle, the incident was not just a source of motivation; it was 
also a seminal experience that put his financial success in perspective and 
protected him from the dangers of hubris. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's healthy to get a comeuppance," Burkle said during an interview at his 
Yucaipa headquarters. "A humiliation every five to 10 years helps you maintain 
priorities -- the importance of friends, family and community." 
</P>
<P>
 In that vein, Burkle has built a record of social and community responsibility 
that he carries out through his Food 4 Less Foundation, a nonprofit 
organization regarded locally as one of the most active philanthropic groups in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation, which sponsors a number of programs for local schools, 
recently helped preserve high school sports programs by providing $2 million to 
the financially strapped Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with the Parents of Watts, a self-help community group, the Food 4 
Less Foundation recently provided a $100,000 grant for the completion of the 
group's new Altadena Recreation Center. The center will provide retreats for 
inner-city youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Many activists in the minority community also credit Burkle for maintaining a 
large supermarket presence in South Los Angeles and other communities with 
large minority populations. Some Food 4 Less competitors have only recently 
started to expand into these underserved areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to give back to the communities in which we make money," Burkle said, 
offering a motivation for his philanthropic activities. "We have a special 
obligation in South-Central Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Such activity, not to mention his growing prominence in the corporate world, 
could raise Burkle's profile. But he rarely gives interviews, and community 
leaders say he avoids the social limelight -- as well as the media spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 John Mack, director of the Los Angeles Urban League, said Burkle declined an 
invitation to sit at the dais at the recent Whitney Young Dinner, a major 
annual event for the organization. Food 4 Less Supermarkets is a major 
financial supporter of the Urban League, and Burkle decided to sit instead with 
some of his company employees attending the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ron is not flashy, but considering his success in business, he's no wilting 
flower," Mack said. "He has very pragmatic business motives. When a company 
increases its involvement in the community, it reaps the rewards in the form of 
loyal customers. He also recognizes that the public sector and private 
enterprise have to work as partners if we are going to address major problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Burkle has cultivated relationships with officeholders in both major political 
parties, but he has more recently given time and money to moderate Democrats 
such as Sen. Dianne Feinstein. President Clinton has visited Burkle's Beverly 
Hills home for a political fund-raiser, and Burkle recently traveled with 
Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown on a trade mission to South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like Democrats or Republicans who are fiscally conservative -- but aware 
and enlightened on social issues," Burkle said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Burkle wants to make a political donation, he draws on personal wealth 
derived from successful investments in the commodities and currency markets. 
However, investment artists such as Leonard Green, who heads an investment 
partnership that controls the Thrifty and PayLess drugstore chains, said Burkle 
is quickly building a reputation in a field in which he initially failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ron does an excellent job of buying -- and building -- supermarkets," Green 
said.

 Amgen Wants Court to Rule on Patent: The Thousand Oaks biotechnology firm is 
seeking a declaratory judgment by a U.S. District Court in Massachusetts that 
it is not infringing Genetics Institute Inc.'s homogeneous erythropoietin 
patent and that the patent is invalid and unenforceable. In a news release, 
Amgen Inc. said it is asking the court to declare that any dispute over the 
patent was entirely resolved by previous litigation and that Genetics Institute 
cannot assert any patent rights relating to homogeneous EPO against Amgen and 
its licensees.Spokesmen for Cambridge, Mass.-based Genetics Institute said the 
company continues to believe in the validity and enforceability of its patent. 
They said Genetics Institute expects to sue Amgen for infringement of the 
patent in the near future.

 Big Three Ask EPA to Hold Up Northeast Auto Plan: In a letter, Chrysler Corp., 
Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. have called on Carol M. Browner, U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency administrator, to delay the agency's expected 
notice that it will approve a California-based auto emissions-cutting plan for 
the Northeast states. The 12 states, from Virginia to Maine, compose the 
EPA-designated Ozone Transport Commission.The auto chieftains, who object to 
the states' plan, said approval is premature. Several environmental groups say 
delays by the EPA already threaten current EPA-sponsored meetings with the auto 
makers, environmental groups and the states that are intended to avoid lawsuits 
and other slowdowns to cutting air pollution. Though it had been expected to 
act, the EPA did not give notice on the proposal last Friday or Monday.

AMEX TO ABSORB TWO THOMAS COOK UNITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 American Express Co. said Monday it is buying the U.S. offices and the 
international business travel unit of London-based Thomas Cook Group Ltd. for 
$375 million. 
</P>
<P>
 American Express said it is seeking to strengthen its corporate travel 
business worldwide, and the two Thomas Cook businesses, with annual sales of 
more than $3 billion, will expand its travel management services business by a 
third. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thomas Cook Partnership is the third-largest travel agency in the United 
States. American Express is No. 1, even before the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Golub, chairman and chief executive of American Express, said the 
Thomas Cook acquisitions are part of an effort to capture a larger portion of 
the $400-billion international corporate travel market. 
</P>
<P>
 Golub said that, among other benefits of the deal, he expects to see spending 
on American Express corporate charge cards rise. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase of Thomas Cook Group, a unit of Germany's Westdeutsche Landesbank 
Gironzentrale, is final, and the agreement to buy Thomas Cook Partnership will 
be closed by Sept. 30, American Express said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Ballou, president of Amex Travel Services Group, said decisions on 
staffing and business practices for the acquired units would be made over time. 
He would not say if or when there will be layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition is expected to affect airlines, travel agents and business 
travelers but have little impact on individuals.

MINNEAPOLIS HMO ADDING TO ACQUISITION LIST; HEALTH: UNITED HEALTHCARE TO PAY 
$520 MILLION FOR GENCARE, LARGEST PLAN IN ST. LOUIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 United HealthCare Corp., a fast-growing operator of health maintenance 
organizations, announced Monday that it has agreed to buy GenCare Health 
Systems Inc. for $520 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The cash purchase would give Minneapolis-based United control of the largest 
health plan in St. Louis, with 365,000 customers in HMOs and other managed-care 
health and dental plans. 
</P>
<P>
 United, founded in 1974, has grown rapidly in recent years through purchases 
of health care programs such as HMOs. It has also expanded by signing up 
thousands of new customers, resulting in an enrollment growth rate of about 20% 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's expansion illustrates the rapid conversion of health care in the 
United States from traditional health insurance programs, which pay for each 
service separately, to managed care, in which patients pay a flat fee and are 
covered for a variety of health needs, often at a lower cost. 
</P>
<P>
 General American Insurance Co., which owns 72% of GenCare shares, has agreed 
to the buyout. 
</P>
<P>
 United now serves more than 23 million people around the country, including 
128,000 members of Physicians Health Plan of Greater St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Purchases this year include Complete Health Services, with 270,000 HMO 
enrollees in seven Southern states, and Ramsay-HMO Inc., with 177,000 HMO 
enrollees in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 United earned $196.4 million last year, a 71% increase from 1992, and will 
have plenty of cash to fund its acquisitions. In May, it agreed to sell 
Diversified Pharmaceutical Services Inc., its prescription benefits management 
subsidiary, to British-based drug maker SmithKline Beecham for $2.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of Monday's agreement call for United HealthCare to pay $47.50 a share 
for each of GenCare's shares. That's a 20% premium over GenCare's closing price 
of $39.50 on the Nasdaq stock market Friday. GenCare's shares rose $6.50 Monday 
to $46.

PRODUCTION COSTS MOUNT FOR B-2 STEALTH BOMBER; DEFENSE: CONGRESSIONAL STUDY 
SAYS PROBLEMS, DELAYS MAY PUSH PRICE PAST $44-BILLION CEILING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Production of the B-2 Stealth bomber may exceed a government-imposed cost 
ceiling of $44 billion, according to a congressional study. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems in the bat-winged airplane's radar-evading technology, its own 
terrain-avoidance radar and its computer software, as well as testing delays, 
threaten to raise production costs for the 20 bombers ordered by the Pentagon, 
the report concludes. 
</P>
<P>
 The report by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of 
Congress, is dated Sept. 8 but has not yet been released. Defense Week, a 
newspaper that covers defense issues, reported the GAO's findings in Monday's 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe there is uncertainty about whether the Air Force will be able to 
complete B-2 acquisition within the cost limitation," the GAO concluded. 
"Significant development, testing, production and modification efforts are 
required before the 20 operational aircraft meet their final performance 
configuration." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Defense Department's strategic and space systems director, George 
Schneiter, responded that while there remains "significant work" on the B-2 
program, close oversight "will ensure that the B-2 program is completed within 
the congressionally mandated cost ceiling." 
</P>
<P>
 News of the report comes a day before the Senate was expected to pass and send 
to President Clinton the 1995 defense authorization bill that contains $125 
million to study the nation's future bomber needs. Supporters of the B-2 fought 
for inclusion of that money to keep open the possibility of buying more B-2s 
than the 20 already on order. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress last year voted to cap the B-2 program at 20 aircraft and mandated a 
cost ceiling of $44.4 billion. To date, the Air Force has accepted two 
production models of the B-2. 
</P>
<P>
 The exotic shape of the B-2 -- it looks like a flying wing -- and its skin of 
radar-evading composite materials, along with the development of this 
technology, contributed to the high price of the bomber, which is built in 
Southern California by Northrop Grumman Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 A key area of concern is the so-called radar cross-section, or RCS, of the 
B-2. The cross-section measures the degree to which the B-2 is at all 
detectable by radar.  
</P>
<P>
 The GAO noted that relatively minor changes in the bomber's configuration can 
affect its radar profile, raising concerns about whether Northrop Grumman can 
produce a consistent product. 
</P>
<P>
 Other problems include glitches in the airplane's radar system that enables it 
to fly low even in mountainous areas, and with the plane's defensive systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The high cost of the B-2 has forced the Air Force and the contractor to test 
the aircraft while production goes on, instead of beforehand. Thus, as testing 
turns up new problems, the cost of going back and fixing the problems on 
bombers already being assembled is considerable, the GAO warned.

THIS BRITISH INVASION COMPETES WITH NEIMAN MARCUS CATALOGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Decisions, decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Will this year's top his-and-hers Christmas gift be a $7,500 underwater scuba 
scooter from Neiman Marcus? 
</P>
<P>
 Or will it be a $25,000 trip to London that includes dinner with a member of 
the House of Lords and a stay at Hampton Court, the royal palace that was home 
to King Henry VIII, from the House of Windsor Collection? 
</P>
<P>
 The House of Windsor, a new catalogue for Anglophiles, tried to upstage 
Neiman's traditional splashy Christmas gift reception Monday, but in an 
oh-so-British fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Neiman's showed off its top gifts to faithful shoppers at its lavish morning 
reception complete with three herald trumpeters, a mother-and-baby pair of 
grazing miniature donkeys and a Santa Claus wearing a beard, rolled-up red suit 
and flippers. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Windsor gang scheduled a 5 p.m. private reception in New York 
hosted by Queen Elizabeth's cousin, Prince Michael of Kent, chairman of the 
catalogue's advisory board. British trade officials and diplomats were invited, 
but it was magazine journalists only. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of much more tony," sniffed Brad Larschan, president and chief 
executive of the House of Windsor Collection. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very British affair, and Neiman's is a very Dallas affair, and 
we're just different. But we're good friends, and we look forward to giving 
them a little bit of competition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The upscale department store chain has been showcasing extravagant Christmas 
gifts since 1959. The Windsor catalogue was introduced this spring and is 
dedicated to the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
 Neiman's began mailing 3 million copies of its catalogue Monday, while 2 
million copies of the slimmer House of Windsor holiday catalogue also went to 
the post office.

 Directors Mortgage in Sales Talks: Riverside-based Directors Mortgage Loan 
Corp., the state's largest privately held mortgage banker, said it is talking 
with several firms interested in buying the company, but it would not name 
them. Directors also said it hired Furash & Co., a Washington consulting firm, 
to evaluate offers and study other options to raise cash and expand. Several 
mortgage bankers have been purchased over the past few months, in part because 
the tepid real estate market and the end of the long refinancing boom has sent 
their loan volume plunging and made them more accessible to takeovers.

 Lucky Employees Continue Working: About 1,700 warehouse employees and drivers 
for Lucky Stores reported for work Monday without a contract after all-night 
negotiations averted a strike at the supermarket chain's 235 Southern 
California stores but failed to produce an agreement.Letting a 12:01 a.m. 
strike deadline pass, negotiators for the Teamsters and Lucky talked through 
the night and returned to the bargaining table later in the day to meet with a 
federal mediator over issues of job security, work preservation and flexible 
workweeks. "There's no extension of the contract. We're just going day-to-day," 
said Ed Mireles, head of Teamsters Local 952 in Orange, shortly before heading 
into a 5 p.m. session.

TIME WARNER ENTERS CABLE JOINT VENTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Time Warner Inc. will combine more than one-third of its cable operations into 
a new venture with Advance Publications and Newhouse Broadcasting Corp. in a 
deal that will give the media giant an additional 1.4 million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement in effect allows Time Warner to gain control -- without putting 
out any cash -- over the Advance and Newhouse cable operations. The new venture 
will have 4.2 million subscribers, including 2.8 million from Time Warner. It 
also adds to the company's cluster of cable subscribers in Charlotte, N.C.; 
Albany, N.Y., and Central Florida, a development that could boost chances that 
the company will soon move toward developing telephone services in those areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner will own two-thirds of the new venture, with Newhouse and Advance, 
both affiliated with New York's Newhouse family, holding the other third. Time 
Warner officials said that if one values each subscriber's worth to the company 
at about $2,000, the new venture would be valued at more than $8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Seidler Cos. analyst Jeffrey Logsden said that the deal is unlikely to have a 
major financial impact on Time Warner for now but that it may help give it "a 
bigger beachhead" when establishing its new technologies and services through 
its cable systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner remains the second-largest cable operator, behind industry leader 
Tele-Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Affected are cable systems largely in Upstate New York, North Carolina and 
Florida, although cable systems in a small number of California communities -- 
including South Pasadena, Canyon Country, Bakersfield and Orange -- will be 
included in the new area. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Time Warner said it will buy three cable systems owned by Summit 
Communications Group in North Carolina and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Time Warner Chairman Gerald M. Levin said the deal will 
"improve the growth prospects not only for our core cable business and in 
advertising sales, but in the telephone business and future interactive 
services." 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner closed at $36.375 on the New York Stock Exchange, down 12.5 cents.

NETWORKS SET A RECORD WITH ADVERTISING SALES; TELEVISION: ADVANCE PURCHASES OF 
AIR TIME FOR THE 1994-95 SEASON TOTAL AN ESTIMATED $4.4 BILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 The television networks' fall season doesn't officially begin until Sept. 19, 
but it's already a winner in one crucial department: advertising sales. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter who prevails in the ratings when "Frasier" goes against "Home 
Improvement," all four broadcast networks are already posting record revenues 
in terms of advertising dollars spent for TV commercials in prime time for the 
new season. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best season ever for the networks in terms of advertising -- 
everybody's literally selling out everything," said Bill Croasdale, the 
executive in charge of buying commercial time on the networks for Western 
International Media, a media-buying firm. 
</P>
<P>
 According to industry estimates, advance sales for the 1994-95 TV season -- 
known as "upfront" advertising buying -- totaled a record $4.4 billion for ABC, 
CBS, NBC and Fox, and demand for the fall season continues to be high. The 
networks are charging more for commercials sold on a one-shot basis, known as 
"scatter" sales. A 30-second spot in ABC's "Home Improvement," the top-rated 
show last season, is selling for $500,000 during the scatter season, compared 
to $350,000 during upfront, industry sources said. A 30-second commercial in 
NBC's "Seinfeld" is going for about $450,000 in the scatter market, compared to 
about $300,000 upfront. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC is charging rates in the scatter market that are 35% to 40% higher than 
upfront, industry executives said, compared to increases of 12% to 15% on CBS 
and 15% to 20% on both NBC and Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a huge demand for the remaining" air time for commercials, said 
Marvin Goldsmith, ABC's president of sales and marketing, "and we're about 85% 
sold out through September of 1995." 
</P>
<P>
 An improved economic outlook is cited by both network and advertising 
executives as a driving force behind the advertisers' buying spree. 
</P>
<P>
 "The network marketplace usually is a good indicator of the economy four to 
six months down the line, and there's a feeling that the economy has turned 
around," said Paul Schulman, president of his own media-buying company in New 
York. "At the same time, the deterioration of the networks' share of audience 
has halted, and there's a renewed interest in the broad reach of broadcast 
advertising." 
</P>
<P>
 Advertiser-supported cable networks are also seeing increases in ad revenue. 
Upfront advertising among the top-rated basic-cable networks for the 1994-95 
season is expected to exceed $1 billion (compared to $875 million last year), 
representing the first time basic cable has gone over the $1-billion mark, said 
Steve Raddock, vice president of creative services for the Cabletelevision 
Advertising Bureau, an industry organization. 
</P>
<P>
 But the dollars are particularly large -- and the victory particularly sweet 
-- for the broadcast networks, which have seen cable and syndication take away 
ad revenue over the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
 "After several years of looking to spend less on advertising through cable and 
syndication, advertisers are spending more on network TV," said Jon Nesvig, 
president of advertising sales for Fox Broadcasting. "Automobile manufacturers 
are spending heavily to introduce new cars, and there are some good category 
wars brewing out there among fast-food companies, phone services, computers and 
other products fighting each other for market share." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox exceeded its most optimistic forecasts for NFL football, garnering an 
estimated $250 million in advertising before Labor Day, according to industry 
sources, compared to the $395 million it is paying in rights fees per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Demand for network air time is so high that CBS even expects to make money on 
a package of afternoon movies and skating events cobbled together to replace 
the lost NFL games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prime time is very strong, but we're also seeing strong demand" for daytime 
slots, said Joseph Abruzzese, senior vice president for sales at CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the crop of new shows this season was considered a bland one, at 
least according to advertising agency prognosticators who screen and rate 
series pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of program development, there was no 'NYPD Blue' or 'Grace Under 
Fire,' no new shows that were considered 'wow' or breakthrough," Croasdale 
said. "The potential new hits are going to be shows that follow strong, 
established programs."

NLRB ACCUSES SPRINT OF ILLEGAL SHUTDOWN OF UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal labor officials on Monday accused Sprint Corp. of illegally shutting 
down a Spanish-language telemarketing company to thwart union organizing by its 
235 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprint denied the accusation and said its sole reason for the shutdown, eight 
days before a scheduled union election, was that the San Francisco subsidiary 
was a money loser. 
</P>
<P>
 But the National Labor Relations Board's regional office said it found more 
than 50 instances of illegal anti-union conduct by management of La Conexion 
Familiar, the Sprint-owned firm that closed July 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Various managers ordered employees not to talk about the union, conducted 
surveillance of union activities, threatened to fire union supporters and 
threatened to close the plant if workers voted for the union, the NLRB office 
said in a formal complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint seeks to require Sprint to reopen the office, rehire the workers 
and repay their lost wages. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is to be heard in November by an NLRB hearing officer, whose findings 
will be submitted to the board. Either side could then take the case to a 
federal appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
 The board will also decide in the next week or two whether to ask a federal 
judge to order the office reopened while the case is pending, said Joseph 
Norvelli, regional attorney in the San Francisco office. He said those orders 
are being sought increasingly by the current NLRB, whose chairman, William 
Gould, was appointed by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprint, a long-distance telephone company based in Kansas City, Mo., bought La 
Conexion Familiar in 1992 to sell long-distance services to Spanish-speaking 
households. Most of the employees were women who spoke little English and made 
$7 an hour, according to the Communications Workers of America, which sought to 
organize the employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The union said 70% of the eligible employees signed petitions to the NLRB for 
a representation election, which was scheduled for July 22.

ENTREPRENEUR STARES DOWN WOLF AT THE DOOR; MARKETING: FOOD WAS LOW, RENT WAS 
DUE BUT CELLULAR FIRM'S CHIEF HAD AN IDEA AND BACKING OF HIS WIFE AND SEVEN 
CHILDREN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE LOCKE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a bleak February night, and struggling inventor Scott McGregor was 
losing faith. The rent was due, investors were nowhere to be found and food was 
running low. 
</P>
<P>
 He gathered his family of nine and asked: Should he get a job, any job, to 
keep them off welfare? Or should he pursue his dream of hitting it big with a 
cellular phone innovation? 
</P>
<P>
 "Keep going," they said. 
</P>
<P>
 McGregor believes that night four years ago was the turning point in his 
journey from poverty to prosperity, a story of how to succeed in business by 
trying, trying and trying again. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, as head of Telemac, a cellular telecommunications firm which now has 
about two dozen employees and offices in Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador, 
McGregor, 50, can smile as he looks back. He can even laugh, albeit ruefully, 
about the day he drove across town to make sure no one he knew saw him buying 
groceries with food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been down and out. I've been up and down. I've been everything," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, it was clear that the Utah-born McGregor's path to success 
would be rough. The night he decided to start his own company, he and his wife 
were involved in a serious auto crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Once recovered, they moved to California and, with a partner, McGregor started 
a cellular rental firm in 1987. Two years later, he was broke, the result of a 
merger that went sour. 
</P>
<P>
 He decided to start over, this time with a new idea. 
</P>
<P>
 During his days in the rental business, he had discovered that one of the 
industry's biggest problems was an inability to get instant readouts of calls 
made on rented phones. Companies would bill for total minutes used, but 
couldn't provide a breakdown until the information was processed through a 
central office, long after the rental customer was gone. The result was unhappy 
customers who often challenged their bills. 
</P>
<P>
 McGregor had an idea that the right combination of clock, phone and computer 
could fix that problem. He thought his son Greg, a computer whiz, was the 
person to build the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in October, 1989, he began working 18-hour days, trying to attract 
investors. No one was interested. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two things that really saved our bacon is AT&T never cut off our long 
distance and Chevron never canceled our Chevron card," he said. When they ran 
out of money, the family bought food off the snack racks at the gas station. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was scary. It was not a nutritious time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-February, 1990, came the family conference and the decision to press 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowell M. Snowe, a Salt Lake City attorney and lifelong friend, remembers 
telling McGregor "he'd make it if he really wanted to, if he'd hang on." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a great all-American story," said Snowe, now a member of 
Telemac's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Fuenzalida, a friend and mechanic who kept the McGregors' vehicles 
running on account, was another believer. "Even when he was down, he still 
(would) laugh and say, 'No, I'm coming out of this,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst stretch lasted about five months, including a two-week stint on food 
stamps in March, 1990, when the Chevron card was finally canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like such a failure because I could not pull it together," McGregor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came a Sunday night when the McGregors' wobbly finances were about to 
fall flat. They had a notice to vacate their rented house by morning and the 
utilities were to be shut off. 
</P>
<P>
 At 11 p.m., an investor came through. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like literary license, but it was actually, legitimately the 
truth," McGregor said. "Luckily, they wired the money the way they said they 
would, so the checks got paid and away we started." 
</P>
<P>
 At first, McGregor concentrated on renting phones as Greg, then a student at 
UC Davis, kept working on the tracking gadget, eventually known as TRAC, or 
Telemac Rental Accounting Cellular system. 
</P>
<P>
 But in May, 1991, disaster struck -- again. 
</P>
<P>
 An investor's check for $50,000 bounced, leaving the McGregors $37,000 in the 
red. A frantic McGregor used up all his frequent flier miles to meet with the 
investor. He got a letter of regret, but no money. 
</P>
<P>
 McGregor remembers walking out of the office in a daze. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were out of business. We were over with. We were dead," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Distraught, he called a friend, who suggested asking customers to invest. He 
had one only customer, BellSouth of Atlanta, so he called them. Surprisingly, 
they not only were willing to help, they had heard about TRAC and asked for a 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one problem -- the system wasn't ready. In fact, McGregor had not seen it 
at all. But Greg McGregor built it in between studying for finals while 
McGregor begged and borrowed two plane tickets for the trip to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't but a few days later that we had a $55,000 check from Bell South 
and that started us over," he said. "We've never really looked back since." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, TRAC, a patented system, is used by several companies, including 
American Cellular Rental, based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the TRAC system that was the clincher for us to even start a business, 
because without the detailed billing capability it's just very hard to even 
market our service," said marketing director Gina Jay. 
</P>
<P>
 Telemac has a second innovation, a system called TAPS, Telemac Automated 
Programming System. TAPS programs cellular phones before they go on store 
shelves, cutting the ready-to-use time from hours to minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Telemac, which has about two dozen employees, is a family affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Wife Diane is chief operating officer, Greg is vice president in charge of 
engineering, twin sons Chris and Travis are in charge of software and hardware 
respectively, and daughter Caroline is director of operations. Three younger 
children, Sally, Tim and Jill sometimes work part time. 
</P>
<P>
 The family recently took a trip to celebrate their success, and McGregor is 
expanding his suite of offices in a business park in Danville, about 30 miles 
east of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 But there haven't been many splurges, partly because of the memory of the lean 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "People love our products and I'm so proud of them I feel good about that," he 
said, "but every single day of my life I'm scared to death."

HOW TO SPOT, OVERCOME BURNOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Corporate officials can learn to spot the warning signals of overburdened 
workers, such as a lack of motivation, negativity, loss of creativity and 
chronic lateness or absenteeism. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you recognize the signs of job burnout, you can take steps to stop it 
before it impacts your firm's overall effectiveness," said Max Messmer, 
chairman of the Accountemps temporary employment firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Management consultant Harry Levinson said there are a number of remedies for 
employees who feel "dead-ended": 
</P>
<P>
 * Encourage employees to develop skills they can apply toward a change in 
career, especially if the educational costs are reimbursed by the firm. "It's 
not the money so much that matters," Levinson said, "as the palpable sense that 
the company cares." 
</P>
<P>
 * Give "thorough and regular performance feedback," continuing to hold 
employees to high standards. "Even people who are bored with their jobs usually 
feel better doing a good job than a sloppy job," Levinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Encourage employees to get involved in work-related community activities. 
Examples might be teaching work skills to students or serving on a task group 
to improve the arts, local government or the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 After downsizing, companies must share with employees "a crisp, clean, 
coherent, long-term vision for the business and show employees they're working 
toward it" even in the first few months, said Quinn Spitzer, president of a 
management consulting firm, Kepner-Tregoe.

NLRB ACCUSES SPRINT OF ILLEGAL SHUTDOWN OF UNIT 
</P>

<P>
 Federal labor officials on Monday accused Sprint Corp. of illegally shutting 
down a Spanish-language telemarketing company to thwart union organizing by its 
235 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprint denied the accusation and said its sole reason for the shutdown, eight 
days before a scheduled union election, was that the San Francisco subsidiary 
was a money loser. 
</P>
<P>
 But the National Labor Relations Board's regional office said it found more 
than 50 instances of illegal anti-union conduct by management of La Conexion 
Familiar, the Sprint-owned firm that closed July 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Various managers ordered employees not to talk about the union, conducted 
surveillance of union activities, threatened to fire union supporters and 
threatened to close the plant if workers voted for the union, the NLRB office 
said in a formal complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint seeks to require Sprint to reopen the office, rehire the workers 
and repay their lost wages. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is to be heard in November by an NLRB hearing officer, whose findings 
will be submitted to the board. Either side could then take the case to a 
federal appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
 The board will also decide in the next week or two whether to ask a federal 
judge to order the office reopened while the case is pending, said Joseph 
Norvelli, regional attorney in the San Francisco office. He said those orders

</P>
<P>
 Sprint, a long-distance telephone company based in Kansas City, Mo., bought La 
Conexion Familiar in 1992 to sell long-distance services to Spanish-speaking 
households. Most of the employees were women who spoke little English and made 
$7 an hour, according to the Communications Workers of America, which sought to 
organize the employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The union said 70% of the eligible employees signed petitions to the NLRB for 
a representation election, which was scheduled for July 22. On July 14, the 
union said, workers were abruptly told over the loudspeaker that they were 
being fired and were ordered to pack their belongings, submit to a search and 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
 In its complaint, the NLRB office quoted Maurice Rosas, general manager of La 
Conexion Familiar, as telling employees later that day that the office had been 
closed because the workers had sought union representation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sprint spokesman Bill White said Monday that the shutdown was unrelated to 
the scheduled election and was entirely due to the subsidiary's loss of 
customers and money. He said La Conexion Familiar's customer base had dropped 
from 200,000 to 85,000 and that the unit was losing 650 customers a day in May 
and June. 
</P>
<P>
 "LCF was unprofitable, and even under our most optimistic projections and 
assumptions we could not project a profit in the foreseeable future," White 
said.

THE WEEK AHEAD: POZNAN; EAST MEETS WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 900 soldiers from countries on both sides of the former Iron Curtain 
are in Poland this week, taking part in the first military exercises between 
NATO troops and soldiers of the now-defunct Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-day training program is getting under way today at Biedrusko, a 
village north of Poznan in western Poland.It is the initial field operation of 
NATO's Partnership for Peace program, which was created last year to provide 
military training and planning among North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
countries and non-NATO members in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 The soldiers come from 13 countries, including the United States, but there 
are no participants from Russia, which reluctantly joined the partnership 
program this summer but remains wary of NATO's intentions toward the former 
Soviet Bloc countries.

NATIONAL AGENDA; UNCERTAINTY SHUFFLES THE DECK IN JAPANESE POLITICS; 
PREDICTABILITY HAS DISSOLVED ALONG WITH THE DOMINATION OF A SINGLE PARTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The rule of thumb that once applied to Japanese prospects -- political control 
by a single party that would preside over an ever-prospering economy -- has 
disappeared. And no new guidepost has appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Politics has been turned on its head. Total uncertainty has replaced virtual 
predictability. 
</P>
<P>
 The turmoil, combined with burgeoning growth in Asia and the end of the Cold 
War, also has contributed to snarled trade negotiations with the United States 
and a reduced importance placed both on ties with Washington and on the 
U.S.-Japan Security Treaty that permits U.S. bases in Japan. Yet no new 
geopolitical visions are emerging. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, an economy in which setbacks had always been cyclical, and eventual 
return to long-range growth a foregone conclusion, now appears unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
 What economist Isamu Miyazaki called "the biggest, longest and broadest" 
recession in post-World War II history -- a reaction to Japan's rocketing 
"bubble economy" of the late 1980s -- has sent corporate profits, stocks and 
land prices plummeting, staggered banks with bad loans, raised the specter of 
growing unemployment, reversed investment from boom to bust and resisted $300 
billion worth of government pump-priming. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one familiar element remains: Japan's trade surpluses and growing 
exports, spurred on by the recession at home even as Japan's stronger yen cuts 
into trade profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Yesterday's unthinkable -- a Socialist prime minister -- has become today's 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was as if an east German had been named chancellor of Germany," an 
astonished former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said when Tomiichi Murayama 
was elected June 29. The August, 1993, election of Hosokawa, head of a 
fledgling, 15-month-old political party, had itself been only slightly less 
astonishing. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the last 13 months, a country that had not ousted the Liberal 
Democratic Party as its single ruling party for 38 years has seen two changes 
of government, the ouster of three prime ministers and the sharing of power by 
11 political parties. Former archrivals -- the Socialists, who suffered their 
worst defeat in the last election and may not survive the next, and the Liberal 
Democrats -- now rule the country together. 
</P>
<P>
 Reforms unattainable under stability were carried out amid instability. 
</P>
<P>
 The most sweeping overhaul of the political system since the postwar U.S. 
occupation, to be completed this fall, will slash the disproportionate 
electoral clout of farmers by about a third. It also will plunge the country 
into the unknown when the next ballot for the lower house of Parliament is 
held. The possible post-election scenarios for change are many. 
</P>
<P>
 In an ideal development envisioned by former Defense Minister Kazuo Aichi, 
politics would revolve around two large parties. Representatives would vote on 
bills as they do in the United States -- largely by individual decision, not 
mandatory party dictates. Yet voters in new single-seat districts would cast 
ballots with the aim of making their candidate's party leader the next prime 
minister, like the British parliamentary system, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Policies, and not the pork barrel, would highlight campaigns, said Aichi, a 
policy-maker in the opposition Renewal Party, which staged a mass defection in 
June, 1993, to deprive the Liberal Democrats of their historic majority in the 
powerful lower house. 
</P>
<P>
 But another scenario, though remote, would see conservatives regrouping, 
making the LDP a bigger monolith than before, Aichi acknowledged. Already, one 
band of LDP defectors, the splinter New Party Harbinger, has rejoined the 
Liberal Democrats as a junior partner in the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, the LDP is halfway back into power," said former Prime Minister 
Kiichi Miyazawa. 
</P>
<P>
 An old confrontation that perennially dogged Japanese defense policy 
disappeared as Murayama scrapped his Socialist Party's bedrock insistence on 
dismantling the nation's 240,000-strong armed forces and abolishing its 
security treaty with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet military experts like Seiki Nishihiro, a former vice defense minister, 
worry about a "hollowing out" of support for the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty on 
both sides of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that with the Soviet threat gone, some Americans are asking, "Why do 
we need Japan?" Similarly, some Japanese are asking, "Why do we need the U.S. 
bases in Japan?" 
</P>
<P>
 LDP politicians in Okinawa, where 75% of the U.S. bases are located, in July 
started advocating abolition of all American military facilities there in a bid 
to curry favor with voters on the southern island. But party headquarters in 
Tokyo, led by Foreign Minister Yohei Kono, has said nothing opposing U.S. bases 
in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Although President Clinton and Murayama affirmed the importance of the 
U.S.-Japan Security Treaty in July -- as leaders of the two countries always 
have done -- neither they nor any other top official has bothered to explain 
why the treaty is still important, Nishihiro complained. 
</P>
<P>
 To Japanese defense experts, the importance is to ensure that the United 
States retains a military presence in Asia as a "balancer," Nishihiro said. 
"Japan abandoned its World War II goal of seeking hegemony in Asia. But that 
does not mean it wants China or Russia to assume hegemony." 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama's turnabout included acceptance of dispatching troops overseas to 
participate in humanitarian and noncombat U.N. peacekeeping missions -- a move 
his party opposed vociferously only two years ago. But other than pledging to 
work for disarmament, the prime minister has offered no vision for a new 
security policy. 
</P>
<P>
 And now that America's relative economic importance to Japan is dwindling in 
proportion to growth in Asia, where Japan's trade surplus now exceeds its black 
ink with the United States, U.S.-Japan trade disputes that once caused alarm in 
Tokyo draw far less attention from both prime ministers and the press. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 21st Century will be China's century -- and Japan's foreign policy will 
revolve on the dual axis of Japan-U.S. relations and Japan-China relations," 
said Kosuke Ito, a member of the Liberal Democrats' policy board. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, the United States was cited as the only axis of Japan's diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
 The choice of Murayama as prime minister and his policy flip-flop, which 
proved that even the wildest of presumably inconceivable events was possible, 
wiped out the credibility of political forecasting in Tokyo. "So much has 
changed that we don't know which precedents mean anything for the future," said 
an American political analyst, who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 Policy differences that remain -- such as whether to do as much, or as little, 
as possible, to help solve international disputes -- now divide individual 
politicians more than party lines. Doves and hawks roost across the spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can't Find an Axle for Political Confrontation," an Asahi headline said of 
the new political structure. 
</P>
<P>
 New political jokes have emerged. An example: "To a Japanese politician, 
policy is like a subway station. You only stand on the platform until the train 
comes in." 
</P>
<P>
 Koichi Kato, a rising star in the Liberal Democrat ranks, predicted that Japan 
would be ruled by coalition governments for at least five, and possibly 10, 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Minoru Morita, a respected political commentator, said an expected Socialist 
debacle in an upper house election next July could mark the end of the present 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 The Socialists' alliance with the Liberal Democrats will deprive the party of 
the large number of anti-LDP protest votes it once received, said Katsumi 
Samata, who served 35 years as a Socialist staff member. 
</P>
<P>
 And now that Murayama has wiped out the old doctrine, Socialists are likely to 
lose the party's ideologues as well, he pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Murayama is being called the 'chairman of the Socialists' funeral committee' 
-- in charge of burying the party," Samata said. 
</P>
<P>
 Political analysts, however, are making few other predictions. They confess 
they are not even sure what groups will run in the next lower house election. 
Already defections, feuds and shifting alliances have created a new political 
map splotched with 17 political parties and "associations." The Liberal 
Democrats, for example, have lost nearly a third of the seats they held in 1993 
through defections alone. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Takeo Tanaka, who runs a children's clothing store in the Kameari 
section of Tokyo, was enraged by LDP politicians pocketing windfall profits 
from capital gains in a stock-for-favors scandal even as they imposed a 
consumption tax on daily necessities of the Japanese people. And his opinion of 
politicians hasn't changed today as politicians debate increasing the 
consumption-tax rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before raising the tax, why don't politicians reform government to cut 
expenses and set a model themselves?" he complained. "In Japan, as soon as you 
become a politician, you become rich." 
</P>
<P>
 Polls show once again that the political party favored by the biggest 
plurality is "none of the above." 
</P>
<P>
 Average Japanese, nonetheless, consistently express high levels of 
satisfaction with their living standards. Nearly 90% of families consider 
themselves middle class. And despite astronomical costs of housing, nearly 
two-thirds of Japanese are satisfied with their present living conditions, a 
poll by the prime minister's office showed in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, 60% of families own their own living unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the political turmoil and the economic recession, "most people don't 
have a sense of crisis. They aren't worried about their livelihoods," said 
Ryoko Yamaguchi, a therapist. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our family, our biggest concern is whether our son (who is 22 and will 
graduate from college next March) will get a job or not. He's not worried. If 
he doesn't find a job, he says he'll support himself for a year doing part-time 
work, and try again next year. And he is telling us: 'Don't worry. I won't 
impose on you,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The recession, nonetheless, is making consumers more cautious. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who used to think that using things and throwing them away after a 
while was fine are now trying to conserve goods. The feeling that money will 
keep flowing in is gone," Yamaguchi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shopkeeper Tanaka has felt the impact directly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fifteen or 16 (neighboring) shops have closed, and it's the same in every 
neighborhood," he said. But the villain is only partially the recession, which 
he said "has tightened the purse strings of consumers." 
</P>
<P>
 The bigger blow, he said, has come from revisions of the Large Retail Store 
Law that were carried out at the insistence of the George Bush Administration 
on the theory that large stores handle more imports than mom-and-pop shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Government restrictions on the hours and the number of days that department 
stores and supermarkets can operate have been eased, squeezing the shop sector, 
Tanaka complained. "It's now useless to oppose the opening of new large 
stores," he added. "The law may as well have been repealed." 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa succeeded in putting deregulation -- the easing and removal of 
government restrictions on business -- near the top of the political agenda, 
said economist Miyazaki, a former vice minister of the government's Economic 
Planning Agency who now heads the Daiwa Research Institute. "Nowadays, kisei 
kanwa (easing of restrictions) appears everywhere in government reports," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hideo Ishihara, chairman of Goldman Sachs Japan, added, "For the first time in 
history, we are re-examining and reappraising our system on our own, without 
being forced to do so by Americans." But he also said he was "not optimistic 
about deregulation because so many people have their vested interests and 
livelihood at stake." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the political upheaval of the last year, very little change has 
occurred in daily life, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 The common denominator today is uncertainty. Although the Economic Planning 
Agency declared last week that the economy has taken a turn toward "moderate 
recovery," pessimism remains widespread. 
</P>
<P>
 "Capital markets play the role of a heart which pumps blood to the economy. 
Just as a politician with a weak heart cannot become a top-class statesman, an 
economy with a weak heart cannot become top class in the world. Right now, 
(capital markets) are not functioning. The surgeon is trying to make up his 
mind whether to prescribe medication or conduct a major surgery," said Hideo 
Sakamaki, president of Nomura Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth S. Courtis, strategist and senior economist for Deutsche Bank Capital 
Markets Asia, said bad debts held by banks "represent a massive negative for 
the entire economy" that make it "problematic for the economy to expand anytime 
soon." And without domestic growth to pull in imports, Japan's trade surpluses 
for the decade of the 1990s could reach $1 trillion, he warned. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate income has plunged by more than 50%, driving volume on the stagnant 
Tokyo Stock Market down to a quarter of its peak and sending prices plummeting 
to barely half their previous level, said Sakamaki, the Nomura Securities 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six times the central discount rate has been lowered. Three overall economic 
(pump-priming) packages have been announced. But the economy still hasn't taken 
off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miyazaki also said he was confounded by the failure of the pump-priming 
packages to make an impact on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where has all that money gone?" he asked. "It's not clear." 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy that emerges from the recession will be -- and must be -- 
completely different from the one that existed before the recession," Miyazaki 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, even with no increase in domestic demand, labor-intensive 
manufactured imports from neighboring Asian nations are increasing, he noted. 
Yen appreciation, in effect, is forcing Japan to "import labor" indirectly to 
cut costs, and that trend will be a feature of the "new economy," he insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Japan will face, for the first time, "jobless growth," or an 
economy in which the GNP rises by an annual 3.5% or more without producing new 
jobs. Unemployment, he said, is likely to become a new issue for the country.

DOING BUSINESS; MCDONALD'S HAPPY MEALS IN RIO: CHAMPAGNE, WAITERS AND MUSIC; 
BEER ON TAP, LIVE SAMBA HELP BRAZIL PUT ITS STAMP ON FAST-FOOD CHAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was Friday evening, the end of a long workweek. Niraldo Aburque and his 
friends at the state transportation department in downtown Rio were in the mood 
for a happening Happy Hour. 
</P>
<P>
 So they cleared their desks, locked the office and headed for the one place 
they knew where for two hours the beer would be flowing, a live band would be 
playing and there was plenty of food to be had. 
</P>
<P>
 They went to McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the Golden Arches, Brazilian-style, where a Big Mac can be washed 
down with a cold beer, patrons can gobble their Quarter Pounder and fries to 
the sounds of live samba and, on certain nights, meals are served under 
candlelight by waiters bearing champagne. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Brazil," explains Peter Rodenbeck, a top executive in McDonald's 
eighth-largest market. 
</P>
<P>
 A burger and beer is not unique to Brazilian McDonald's. The U.S. chain's 
outlets in Germany, Britain and France also serve beer and wine. 
</P>
<P>
 But across this country, Brazilians are putting their own special stamp on the 
McDonald's image, most noticeably with the creation of their Happy Hours, 
complete with suds and salsa bands, or disc jockeys and jukeboxes. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald's gave its Rio restaurants permission to pour after franchisees and 
managers of company-owned restaurants insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started getting calls from restaurants who said they wanted to serve beer 
and have music," Rodenbeck said. "We investigated and gave them permission to 
do it. It's a cultural thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The first McDonald's to embark on the transformation was in a poor community 
called Cashia in the northeast part of the city. Since the Happy Hours started 
earlier this year, about 200 people have crowded into the restaurant every 
Friday and Saturday from 7 p.m. to midnight to listen to music, have a beer 
with friends and eat Brazilian delicacies not found on U.S. menus. 
</P>
<P>
 Other restaurants in Rio quickly followed suit. Happy Hour outlets now stretch 
from downtown to the upscale Barra da Tijuca, a relatively exclusive beachfront 
community south of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Happy Hour trend has spread to the capital, Brasilia, the resort community 
of Fortaleza and the cities of Goinaia, Sao Paulo and Vitoria. 
</P>
<P>
 Salim B. Maroun, a Lebanese businessman who owns a McDonald's downtown, 
started his Happy Hours four months ago after watching his lunch patrons walk 
past his outlet on Friday nights en route to other restaurants that served 
beer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cariocas (as Rio de Janeiro natives are called) like to have their beer on 
Friday," said Maroun, who moved to Brazil from Canada four years ago. "They 
were asking for it, so I said, 'Why not give them beer for two hours?' I don't 
want anybody not to come to McDonald's because they can't find what they want." 
</P>
<P>
 Every Friday evening, Maroun reserves the top floor of his 250-seat McDonald's 
for government workers, bank employees and others from the nearby high rises. 
</P>
<P>
 In one corner, two workers in McDonald's outfits busily pump beer into plastic 
cups from huge kegs at a makeshift bar. The first beer is on the house. Others 
cost 70 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been very good for business," Maroun said. "We've probably increased it 
by 60%." 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, his patrons are workers who simply want to unwind before heading home, 
although there is some intermingling among the sexes. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Apolinario, 23, and a fellow salesperson, Andrea Oliveira, 24, are 
enjoying the change. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice because of the beer and the atmosphere," said Apolinario, who also 
frequents the restaurant for lunch, "and the music is good too." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," Oliveira said. "People go to the other bars to listen to pagode (a 
more raucous Brazilian music). This is better. The atmosphere here is more 
classy." 
</P>
<P>
 "Being in this place is more sophisticated," said Roberta do Carino, 23, a 
cashier at a local store. "People don't abuse the place. They don't drink too 
much. They don't get too loud." 
</P>
<P>
 Classy and sophisticated are not words usually associated with McDonald's 
restaurants, but in Brazil, where a Big Mac Special is equivalent to half a 
day's pay for many, the restaurants hold a different position in the dining 
hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of the McDonald's in upscale Ipanema has been trying to capitalize 
on that perception. Every Tuesday night, from 8 to 10, the restaurant becomes 
the equivalent of Chez McDonald's. The houselights are dimmed, soft jazz is 
piped through the restaurant, and 12 tables are set aside for candlelight 
dining. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrons order from menus and waiters bring the food on huge platters. Meals 
are accompanied by a complimentary bottle of champagne. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something we do for families and couples who live in the area," said 
Maria Celina de Arruda Franco, marketing coordinator. "People really enjoy it 
because it's different. Then, there are couples who can't afford a real dinner, 
so they come here and have the atmosphere. They can say they had a candlelight 
dinner and champagne -- at McDonald's. "

THE WEEK AHEAD: TOKYO; JAPAN SENDING TROOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama's Cabinet gives final approval today to 
dispatching 480 Japanese troops on a humanitarian mission to aid refugees from 
Rwanda at two camps in Zaire. It would mark the fourth time since the end of 
World War II that Japan will have sent its troops overseas.The move underscored 
a commitment to get involved in foreign trouble spots. The government sent 
three missions to Rwanda and Zaire to study conditions there before making up 
its mind to dispatch troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Japan gave $13 billion in support of the 1991 Gulf War, it suffered 
criticism for "checkbook diplomacy" when it dispatched no personnel to the 
region while the fighting was going on. Only after Iraq was subdued did Japan 
send a team of minesweepers to the Persian Gulf. It also deployed troops to 
U.N. peacekeeping operations in Cambodia and Mozambique.

THE WEEK AHEAD: STOCKHOLM; SWEDE ELECTORAL TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After three years of cutting back Sweden's legendary social welfare program, 
Prime Minister Carl Bildt leads his center-right coalition into national 
elections Sunday nursing only slim hopes of winning a new mandate to continue 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
 As campaigning entered its final days, polls showed the four government 
parties still trailing the opposition Social Democrats, although there were 
signs the gap was narrowing slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 The election race has also taken on an added dimension with unexpectedly 
strong gains by two far-left parties, who are urging Swedes to vote against 
European Union membership in a referendum next month.

CHANGING LIFESTYLES; HEALTH REFORM HAS A HOLD ON AUSTRALIA; SYSTEM KEEPS COSTS 
DOWN AND HAS MEDICAL COMMUNITY'S SUPPORT. EVEN CONSERVATIVES SAY IT'S HERE TO 
STAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES P. WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The debate over health care now taking place in the United States elicits 
sympathetic nods in Australia, where a reform-minded government adopted 
sweeping change a decade ago. While the changes are still hotly debated, a key 
indication of the plan's popularity is that even conservatives now accept that 
national health care is here to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the plan was adopted, Australia was in many ways similar to the United 
States: The country had a strong tradition of private medical care along with 
public clinics to tend to the poor. About 17% of the population, the same 
proportion as in America today, had no health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan that was adopted in 1984, called Medicare, relied on both public 
health care and private medicine. Private doctors constitute an immensely 
powerful political lobby in Australia, so powerful that the federal 
constitution was amended to prevent Australia from following Britain in forcing 
doctors into a compulsory health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 By one measure, at least, the approach has been an unqualified success: 
holding down costs. Health care expenditures have risen from 7.4% of Gross 
Domestic Product in 1974 to just 8.5% of GDP today. The United States spends 
close to 14% of its GDP on health care. 
</P>
<P>
 "Interest groups apart, in fact Medicare keeps most people happy most of the 
time," said John Deeble, one of the two principal architects of the plan. 
"There is a general perception that the system provides good access to quality 
medical care." 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly put, Medicare is a publicly funded and administered universal 
insurance system to pay for doctor care. A national board was set up to manage 
the system, and it published a schedule of fees for every service that doctors 
provide. It pays 85% of the scheduled fee to a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have one health insurance system that supplies all payments in the 
country. It has saved hundreds of millions of dollars in the American context" 
of multiple private insurance companies, said Peter Botsman, executive director 
of the Evatt Foundation, a labor union think tank. "We have a better record of 
controlling prices than the English." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the system has the general support of Australia's medical community. 
"We support the system's universal coverage," said Bill Coote, secretary 
general of the Australian Medical Assn., adding, however, that doctors would 
like the scheduled fees determined on a "more scientific basis" to take into 
account the costs of running a medical practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Medicare has two basic applications. On office visits, patients can choose a 
doctor. Hospital care is different; visits to public hospitals are free, but 
the patient has no choice of doctor. In a private hospital, the patient can 
choose the doctor, but virtually all doctors in such circumstances charge more 
than the scheduled fee. 
</P>
<P>
 If a patient chooses a doctor who charges more than the fee set by the 
government, the patient has to make up the difference. The Medicare law 
prohibits insurance for this gap, because the government believed that this 
would drive up prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the case of a Sydney woman, Cathy Kell, whose second son developed 
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma when he was 3 months old. He received hundreds of 
thousands of dollars of medical care in a specialist public pediatric hospital 
at no cost. "If we lived in America, we would have lost our house," Kell 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Kell's third child was born, she opted for a private obstetrician 
because she wanted to choose the doctor. She and her husband paid the 
additional $600. She had the baby in a public hospital, where the delivery room 
was free, then moved to a private hospital because she preferred a private room 
rather than a hospital ward. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system's got great flexibility," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The story illustrates one way in which Australia differs from the United 
States: Public hospitals are perceived to offer equal or better care than 
private institutions, which tend to focus more on amenities. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of intense competition for patients, many general practitioners in 
private practice came to the conclusion that it would be cheaper 
administratively to accept the scheduled fee and send all claims in at once. 
Known as "bulk billing," the practice has been widely adopted, with the result 
that most visits to the doctor cost the patient nothing.  
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, specialists are in relatively short supply, and few are 
willing to accept the scheduled fees. So in many cases of elective surgery, 
patients have to wait for a place at a public hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 A recently published survey showed that 43% of ear, nose and throat patients 
and 38% of orthopedic patients waited six months or more for surgery, while the 
average clearance time for patients needing general surgery was 1.3 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Those of sufficient financial means can go to a private hospital. While doctor 
care is not covered by private insurance, all the other amenities such as a 
private room and operating room can be covered. 
</P>
<P>
 One indicator of public acceptance of the Medicare plan is that the number of 
people with private insurance has plummeted in the decade since Medicare was 
adopted, from about two-thirds of Australia's population to just one-third 
today. Indeed, the system may prove too popular -- as more people drop their 
private health insurance the burden increasingly shifts to the public sector. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the public health care system fell off in quality, you'd find people 
increasingly prepared to pay for private care," Deeble said. "There will always 
be some degree of difference between the two sectors. If the public system had 
all the trimmings, there wouldn't be any private system." 
</P>
<P>
 One hotly debated aspect of Medicare is costs. Australians pay 1.4% of their 
income as a Medicare fee, but even the system's most enthusiastic supporters 
admit this a political sleight of hand to disguise the system's true costs. The 
$2.4 billion this raises covers only 18% of Medicare's expenses, with the 
remainder paid out of general tax revenue, contributing to Australia's hefty 
top personal income tax rate of 49%. 
</P>
<P>
 The system realizes savings by minimizing administrative costs. It also 
squeezes public hospitals to keep costs to an absolute minimum, so high 
technology is used less frequently than in the United States. Some critics 
maintain that hospitals have been squeezed too much and that the quality of 
care has begun to suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 An earlier version of national health care, known as Medibank, was introduced 
in Australia in 1973 by a Labor government, but the plan was repealed when the 
Liberal party took power. 
</P>
<P>
 This time around, things are different. Perhaps responding to the public 
acceptance of Medicare in the opinion polls, Alexander Downer, leader of the 
Liberal opposition, conceded recently that if he takes power at the next 
election, Medicare would be left alone.

ETHNIC CONFLICT; KRAJINA TRADES PENSIONS FOR PRIDE; REBEL SERBS ARE OWED BY 
CROATIA. BUT THEY'D RATHER GO WITHOUT THAN ACKNOWLEDGE ZAGREB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stevan Sovilj's lined face and spare frame speak to his need for the $700 
monthly pension he is owed for 41 years of work on the abandoned Zagreb-Split 
rail line, which passes through this rebel Serb stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
 He pulls at the loose waistband of his snagged trousers to show that he has 
lost weight on the $40 he and his family are forced to live on each month amid 
the hardships of a prolonged rebellion and the haywire prices inflicted by war 
in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet at the mere suggestion that his retirement income could be arriving 
regularly if Serbs in the disputed Krajina region made peace with the Croatian 
government in Zagreb, the mild-mannered engineer erupts in a defiant, 
nationalist tirade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Serbs will never be part of Croatia. We cannot live there. We don't have any 
money, but we have our own country. It is my right to choose, and I choose to 
stay here and refuse their money," the silver-haired pensioner declares with 
ferocity. 
</P>
<P>
 If any residents of this self-styled capital of the rogue Republic of Serbian 
Krajina can contemplate being governed as part of Croatia, they are keeping 
those thoughts to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 At the public market, on park benches crowded with homeless refugees, in the 
dusty sidewalk cafes where the legions of unemployed idle away the daylight, 
Krajina Serbs insist they are determined to preserve their independence at any 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than being worn down by four years of oscillating battle and tension, 
they seem prepared to wait out the world's resistance to their claimed 
statehood and endure any suffering necessary during the standoff in this corner 
of the wars that have swept the former Yugoslav federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the allure of pensions owed by the Zagreb government to 60,000 Serbs 
living in the occupied Krajina region seems unable to sway the rebels to 
contemplate a compromise and peace. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as four years ago, all residents of today's Krajina were Yugoslav 
nationals who accrued pensions payable by the government of their republic 
within the Yugoslav federation, in this case Croatia. So retirees here in Knin 
should be collecting their monthly checks from Zagreb. 
</P>
<P>
 But with their insistence that Croatia is a foreign country with no political 
relationship to occupied Krajina, the Serbs of this impoverished and isolated 
region have effectively renounced their claims to be beneficiaries of Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 Idealists like Zora Zelic, who worked 23 years as a hotel maid in the coastal 
resorts of Croatia, insist that Zagreb should pay the pensions to Krajina Serbs 
anyway, noting that retirees who move abroad in most democratic countries 
continue to receive the pensions they earned during their working years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Krajina, however, it wasn't the pensioners who moved, but the 
country. Croatia seceded from Serb-dominated Yugoslavia in June, 1991, 
prompting the Krajina Serbs to grab a third of the Croatian republic's 
territory in a bid to form their own state. 
</P>
<P>
 With all mail service, telephone communication, financial ties and transport 
severed by the rebels four years ago, Zagreb would be hard-pressed to pay the 
Krajina residents even if it wanted to. Authorities have told Western mediators 
that they would gladly resume paying the retired people of Krajina if the 
rebels would restore the banking, postal and political links with Croatia 
necessary to transact the payments. 
</P>
<P>
 But implicit in the integration of economic and social institutions would be 
acknowledgment that they are citizens of Croatia. And virtually no one here 
seems swayed by the offer of a paycheck to give up the claim to independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Pensions are one of seven economic cooperation themes that international 
mediators hope will entice Serbs and Croats in troubled Croatia to come 
together for the mutual benefit of their war-weary populations. U.S. and 
Russian diplomats overseeing reconciliation talks had hoped the promise of a 
step-by-step return to normalcy would make both sides see reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Other proposals that should be advantageous to both sides include reopening 
the blocked highway between Zagreb and Belgrade, capital of the Serbian-run 
rump Yugoslavia; restoring the prewar utility networks now severed by the front 
line; repairing and sharing the proceeds of the Adriatic oil pipeline that 
passes through both territories, and allowing free movement on the roads and 
railways that once traversed the region, like the popular rail line that Sovilj 
spent his career helping to administer. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even the most elementary moves toward cooperation have been rejected by 
both sides as they posture in negotiations and threaten another round of war. 
</P>
<P>
 Croatian President Franjo Tudjman warned in a recent interview that he saw 
increasing signs "the military option" would be required to recover Krajina -- 
a euphemism for a bloody, all-out assault to conquer the heavily armed rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 Milan Martic, the former police officer whom Krajina Serbs elected as 
president in internationally unrecognized balloting in January, has also 
indicated to mediators that his people are prepared to resume combat rather 
than give up their internationally spurned claim of statehood. 
</P>
<P>
 The standoff has been destructive for both sides, with Croatia losing millions 
in unrealized tourist revenue from its empty Adriatic Sea resorts and Krajina 
cut off from the raw materials and trade links needed to resuscitate its idled 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't make any sense for either side to brandish the war sword when 
there are very real opportunities for cooperation," said a senior Western 
diplomat involved in the negotiations. "One can only hope that the politicians 
will sooner or later act in the interest of their people instead of only for 
their own political power." 
</P>
<P>
 But it is exactly that quest for influence over a captive fiefdom that drove 
the Balkan states to war in the first place, with Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic asserting Serbian domination over Albanians in the provinces of 
Kosovo, and Tudjman following suit by trying to relegate Serbs in Croatia to a 
second-class status, which along with prodding from Milosevic encouraged them 
to rebel. 
</P>
<P>
 Because both Tudjman and Milosevic have achieved their main political goals 
of, respectively, gaining international recognition for Croatia and seizing 
land for a Greater Serbia, neither leader is expected to seriously challenge 
the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the logic of reconciliation and the financial boost it would provide 
both peoples, it remains a dim prospect amid the hostilities and political 
gamesmanship rampant in Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 And issues like pensions, unhindered travel and income from transporting oil 
have been made hostages of a political settlement few observers see any chance 
of emerging in this century. Balkan Breakdown 
</P>
<P>
 After the collapse of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which began in 1991, 
it broke up into five independent republics -- Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, 
Macedonia, Slovenia and the rump Yugoslavia, which consists of Serbia and 
Montenegro. Each possesses a variety of ethnic concentrations. The breakdowns:

 Residents of the rogue Republic of Serbian Krajina insist that Croatia is a 
foreign country with no political relationship to the rebel Serb stronghold. 
Krajina, which means edge, covers four non-contiguos areas; the largest area 
includes the rebels' self-styled capital, Knin.

CULTURE; HOMELESS ARTIST'S WALL TEARS DOWN BARRIERS TO PEACE; WALTER HERMANN 
HAS STRUNG UP MESSAGES OF HOPE IN THE SHADOW OF COLOGNE'S GREAT CATHEDRAL. BUT 
HIS MISSION FACES OPPOSITION FROM RIGHTISTS AS WELL AS FROM THE CHURCH ITSELF. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It took the Roman Catholic Church six centuries, overcoming a cash crunch and 
an invasion by Napoleon's army to complete Northern Europe's largest cathedral, 
the great, Gothic Dom of Cologne. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless artist Walter Hermann was, naturally, much swifter in stringing up 
his cardboard "Wailing Wall for Peace" in the shadow of the church's twin, 
500-foot-high filigreed spires. But Hermann too has faced hurdles in keeping 
his project alive, among them physical attacks by rightists and opposition from 
the church itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wailing Wall, says Hermann, is a continually evolving piece of art, a 
forum for anyone who wants to deliver a message against violence, war, hatred 
of foreigners or homelessness. And tens of thousands of people have hung their 
messages of peace in dozens of languages on his wall. 
</P>
<P>
 To the church, however, and to city officials, Hermann's creation is an 
infringement on a public plaza and the cardboard squatter's hut he has built 
against the 13th-Century cathedral sends a message to homeless people to move 
into the city center. 
</P>
<P>
 A state court has ruled against Hermann, allowing the church and city to evict 
him from the plaza. But Hermann is appealing the decision, and the two sides 
are in negotiations to see whether they can find an acceptable alternative site 
for the Wailing Wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Hermann and his wall remain in the plaza, a seemingly popular 
attraction to tourists visiting the Dom. He has installed a mailbox -- 
borrowing the cathedral's address -- for his correspondence from around the 
world and sells postcards of the more artistic contributions to the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 The church is waiting for a decision on the legal appeal before taking action 
against Hermann, said spokesman Bernard Henrichs, "because if we take down the 
wall now, we know he'll just put it up again." 
</P>
<P>
 Hermann, a 55-year-old former teacher, erected his first Wailing Wall Against 
Homelessness in 1989 outside a nearby department store when he was evicted from 
his apartment in a payment dispute. Police took down that wall, and others, but 
Hermann rebuilt 16 times. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Persian Gulf War in 1991, Hermann and friends in the peace movement 
decided to take the wall to the cathedral plaza and rename it the Wailing Wall 
for Peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a connection between the housing shortage and armaments," Hermann 
said. Noting that 4,000 homeless people live on the streets of Cologne, he said 
that "with just part of (the money) the government contributed to the war, they 
could have eliminated the homeless problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Police have removed Hermann and the wall from the plaza of the Dom before, but 
he and his supporters among the city's homeless people, artists and peace 
activists set it up again. 
</P>
<P>
 Neo-Nazis also have torn down the wall -- and assaulted Hermann -- but he has 
made friends with the cathedral's night watchman, who he says calls for help if 
Hermann is under attack. Hermann says that neo-Nazis are the reason he sleeps 
by the cathedral -- to protect his work of art. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wailing Wall for Peace is actually three walls of cardboard strung up in 
the shape of a ship between light posts, one of which serves as the ship's 
mast. A gas lantern serves as beacon at night for the 12-foot-high wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the wind blows, it is like a ship on the high sea, a ship that carries 
messages," Hermann said. 
</P>
<P>
 The messages are in Hebrew and Arabic, Japanese and Chinese, English and 
German and many more languages. Some of the messages are trite, such as "Peace 
of Cake." Others are cliches, like "Don't Dream Your Life, Live Your Dreams." 
And there's an angry obscenity for the Holden Caulfields of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The wall also provides a forum for public debate. "Good Things Happened at 
Hiroshima," wrote an American. "1) It ended WW II. 2) We Won." 
</P>
<P>
 "Two things are never ending," answered another writer, quoting Einstein. "The 
universe and human stupidity. But I wouldn't be too sure about the universe." 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally some smart aleck hangs a curse or racist epithet in a language 
that Hermann cannot read, but soon enough a well-intentioned soul will clue him 
in and he takes it down. 
</P>
<P>
 The multilingual, multicultural graffiti somehow come together with an 
interesting "moral value," the state court acknowledged in its ruling. The 
messages are surrounded by slightly wilted flowers -- donations from a nearby 
shopkeeper -- and inside the ship is an exhibit on the explosion of the atomic 
bomb at Nagasaki. 
</P>
<P>
 Hermann leaves pieces of cardboard and pens at the wall for passersby who want 
to make a contribution. He changes some of the messages every day but keeps the 
old ones, numbering about 35,000, in stacks inside the ship and in storage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Wailing Wall is a work that everyone can take part in and that satisfies 
me," Hermann said. "The church doesn't like it because it's autonomous. Here a 
person comes and takes responsibility for himself and writes a message. In the 
church, responsibility is delegated from the top." 
</P>
<P>
 The church reserves comment on Hermann. 
</P>
<P>
 But not the tourists who stopped to stare at Hermann's oeuvre on a recent 
summer afternoon. "This is good," Hong Kong engineering student Derek Hoo said 
as he prepared to write a message. "It is a warning to people that war is 
horrible." 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a shame to take it down," added German student Nicola 
Lienenkamper. "It raises people's awareness and gets them thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Thinking maybe, but not always along the lines Hermann hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a liberal guy," said a 60ish German engineer who declined to be 
identified, "but my liberalism is not so broad that we should help people at 
any price. Those asylum-seekers can't come here with 10, 12, 14 children, with 
no life perspective and give birth to a child a year." 
</P>
<P>
 And what about peace? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not in the big city of Cologne," the man huffed. "You can't even walk around 
here at night."

MARKET SCENE; IN BRITAIN, VANITY LICENSES ARE SELLING LIKE HOT PLATES; FRENZY 
OVER ELITE TAGS DRIVES OWNERS TO PAY WHOPPING PRICES WHILE PUTTING MONEY IN THE 
COUNTRY'S COFFERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The fad began back in the 1950s when gap-toothed comedian Terry-Thomas tooled 
around town in a car bearing the license plate TT 1. Not to be outdone, singer 
Max Bygraves was soon driving MB 1 and prestidigitator Paul Daniels' car was 
tagged MAG1C. 
</P>
<P>
 The British are crazy about vanity plates, and they are aided and abetted by 
the Department of Transport which feeds the frenzy by auctioning off desirable 
combinations. 
</P>
<P>
 Each August, the initial license letter changes and the DOT's Drivers and 
Vehicles Licensing Agency, with an eye on revenue, puts some tantalizing plates 
on the block. This year the letter was M, and the combinations for sale 
included MI OWN, MIAOW, MIDAS and MI6 SPY. 
</P>
<P>
 An August purchase delivers the buyer a double whammy of prestige -- the 
possibility of a unique vanity plate and the M designation proclaiming a car 
from the new model year. Car makers complain that 25% of all yearly purchases 
are made in August, skewing production schedules and driving up storage costs. 
But police authorities insist the prefix system is helpful because people can 
remember the first letter of license plates of offending vehicles. And for the 
buyer, the difference of this year's M prefix over last year's L can mean 
several hundred dollars in resale value. 
</P>
<P>
 The license agency further pumps up demand with a vigorous campaign 
advertising the vanity plates up for auction in bidding that runs through the 
year. Unlike many American states, where drivers can select vanity plates at a 
nominal cost, rare registrations command whopping prices in Britain, sometimes 
more than the car. 
</P>
<P>
 In Britain, the plate stays with the car for life, unless the owner decides to 
sell it to someone who wants to share the vanity. Often the number 1 is 
substituted for the letter I in top-selling plates. For instance, the latest 
government-sponsored auction sold M1DGE for $9,600, M1LKY for $7,800, and M1NKS 
for $4,200. While MI OWN, for possessive types; MIAOW, for cat-lovers; MIDAS, 
for millionaires; M1SER, for cheapskates; M1CKY and M1NER were put up for 
auction in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Those with an interest in espionage might bid for MI6 SPY, since MI-6 is the 
popular designation for Britain's Secret Intelligence Service. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical plate not on the auction block this August was a combination of 
numbers and letters: M435 YEX. But thousands of other M permutations that the 
DVLA believes have some special appeal are available on a first-come, 
first-served basis at $500 each. The DVLA restricts any combination it 
considers improper. Ordinary licenses come at no cost, but all British drivers 
pay a road tax of approximately $200 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The license agency reckons that since it adopted the practice of selling elite 
plates five years ago it has sold about 300,000 for a total of $225 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The highest recorded price in a private sale was an auction at Christie's in 
1993 that brought a price of $352,000 from an anonymous buyer. The plate: K1 
NGS. 
</P>
<P>
 Though automobiles had been tagged in Paris since 1893, the first British 
plates were not issued until 1903, by the London County Council. The second 
Earl Russell, philosopher Bertram Russell's elder brother, waited in line all 
night for the plate, which was designated A 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Car numbering was based on groups of two and then three letters and numbers, 
allocated regionally. These plates, with the last two letters indicating where 
a vehicle was registered, are prized today. The annual letter identifier, like 
this year's M, was introduced in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 And about that time, motorists got interested in vanity plates. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolls Royce went to great expense to insure that its top showroom model 
sported RR 1. Similarly, Ford Motor Co. went after CAR 1. A Jaguar dealer chose 
BUY 1. Chanel Perfumes had a delivery van labeled NO 5. Even the National Coal 
Board acquired a van marked NCB 1. Porsche owners like variations of the 911 
theme. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman interested in astrology spent $6,750 for the plate L1 BRA, her birth 
sign. An animal lover paid $1,950 for K9 DOG. Insiders say the agency controls 
in a slow flow some of the highly desired plates such as D1ANA, F1RST, CHR1S, 
DAV1D and B1NGO. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, the Transport Department authorized the DVLA to sell head-turning 
plates for profit. These days, some 1,000 people a day call the DVLA hot line 
to inquire about specialized plates for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a nationwide business in buying and selling special plates has 
developed, and newspaper classified sections run long lists at whopping prices. 
An ad in the Sunday Times lists J1PSY at $15,000. Another lists FB 1, at "best 
offer considered over $75,000." 
</P>
<P>
 "People are willing to pay a very high price for a one-of-a-kind plate that 
means something to them," says Donald Marks, a plate dealer in Hull. Some 
buyers want personal or witty plates. Others seek rare plates that go back 
decades and might reflect identification with a particular region.  
</P>
<P>
 "They have many different reasons for buying," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 One purchaser, Philip Pond, explains: "It became my ambition to have a 
distinctive plate on my car, if only to personalize the impersonal and opt out 
of the 'You must have the latest registration letter' rat race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came across details of an Attractive Vehicle Registration Numbers auction 
to be held in Harrogate in North Yorkshire. I discovered 9999 PP among the lots 
for sale, along with another desirable number from my point of view: PJP 1. It 
seemed too good an opportunity for Philip Joseph Pond to miss. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, a Patrick John Pincombe, a retired financier, ensured that lot 402 
-- PJP 1 -- was not to be mine," Pond recalled. "He had been looking for PJP 1 
for 20 years. He bid $7,800. In due course, lot 498 -- 9999 PP -- came up. The 
price rose to my last bid, $3,300. The gavel came down and 9999 PP was mine." 
</P>
<P>
 The DVLA provides the license-buying public -- through the hot line -- with 
three special types of plates for "cherished and personalized registration 
numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 "Select" registration where the purchaser chooses from 52 number combinations 
and then completes them with three letters of the buyer's choosing, possibly to 
match one's personal or company initials. Prices start at $517. 
</P>
<P>
 "Custom" registrations with thousands of leftover A, H, J or K plates with 
combinations that might have personal significance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Classic" registrations, which in the words of the DVLA are "truly prestigious 
and considered by many to have an investment value." These are sold through 
four or five annual auctions at various national venues. They are advertised 
extensively and the agency issues a catalogue of numbers. Sealed bids are 
accepted. Most prices range upward of $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 The DVLA, in its advertising, hawks the personalized plates as "a perfect gift 
for any occasion." As a sample, it suggests for a golfer A18 TEE. 
</P>
<P>
 One dealer offering unusual combinations admits: "I think people who pay 
exorbitant prices must be daft. But they do seem to want rare personal plates."

A FALLEN PREMIER REFLECTS UPON JAPAN'S YEAR OF TUMULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an interview with The Times, Kiichi Miyazawa, the first of three prime 
ministers to be ousted in the past year of political tumult in Japan, gave his 
views on developments in his country: 
</P>
<P>
 On a diminishing sense of urgency in Japan about economic frictions with the 
United States: 
</P>
<P>
 "We've made all sorts of efforts for countless years, but our surplus with 
America hasn't gone down at all. We've come to a kind of resignation, a feeling 
of giving up hope. . . . There also has been a reaction in Japan to (the 
Clinton Administration's) harsh approach. And . . . leadership in taking up 
this problem directly at the top level has disappeared in Japan. . . . Concern 
has fallen." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Japan's trade surplus with the United States: 
</P>
<P>
 "During the last 20 years, exports from Japan have been 'built into' American 
society -- not just consumer goods but capital goods -- even into (defense) 
sectors. A part of the two nations' economies has been integrated." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On security policy: 
</P>
<P>
 "(Japan) doesn't have any inclination to become a military power or to change 
the constitution. Therefore, the framework for Japan's security into the 21st 
Century is the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty structure as a stabilizer for all of 
Asia. . . . What Asian countries, including Japan, are most worried about in 
the 21st Century is the direction China will take. The American presence is 
very important." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On sending noncombat troops on U.N. peacekeeping missions: 
</P>
<P>
 For decades Japan paid no attention to "whatever happened overseas, and we got 
fat doing that. The Gulf War forced us to go through great soul-searching. We 
gave money -- $13 billion. But we didn't even shed perspiration." Condemnation 
of that hurt. Japanese concluded they "probably should have perspired" to give 
something beyond money but aren't prepared "to shed blood, whatever the cause." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On why $300 billion in government pump-priming has not yet resuscitated the 
economy: 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy was swallowed up . . . in a black hole (of deflation). . . . 
Everyone misread the depth of the black hole. I too misread it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On bad debts that have crippled banks: 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that banks couldn't fulfill their normal function really hurt the 
economy. . . . Money, which is the blood of the economy, didn't flow smoothly. 
. . . I offered a government rescue to the banks." But they rejected it. They 
feared if they accepted taxpayers' money, the government inevitably would 
"start meddling in their business." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the future of the economy: 
</P>
<P>
 "Downsizing has come to Japan. But while Japan too must do restructuring, its 
labor customs -- lifetime employment, seniority -- have many merits. Managers 
won't easily mimic the United States. . . . This has been a terrible recession, 
but Japan's potential has not been uprooted." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On economic reform: 
</P>
<P>
 "What Japan has learned through this recession is cost-consciousness. . . . 
Reforms will emerge from what recently has been called the 'destruction of 
price structures.' But deregulation can only occur slowly. . . . Japan is a 
safe society because government protection has been broadly extended. It's a 
regulated society." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On political and economic turmoil: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's appealing to try to see change in the economy in parallel with politics, 
and then conclude that both are in a terrible mess -- a shambles. . . . (But) 
what has happened (in the last year) is proof that changing cabinets 
ceaselessly is not a change. We must wait until an election is carried out 
under the single-seat districts to see what will happen." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 On efforts by the opposition to form a new conservative party to oppose 
Miyazawa's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP): 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the Renewal Party (of former Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata) and 
that bunch . . . will be able to build a substantial, consistent platform that 
is different from ours. I am very skeptical that politics will develop into a 
confrontation between two big conservative parties. If it does, it would 
develop into a battle over revising the constitution. That would be a 
misfortune." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama abandoning 40 years of Socialist 
ideological policies: 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the Socialists have lost their function. We conservatives will 
support a market economy, smaller government, deregulation. But a market 
economy has its faults. There is a need for a party that speaks out for weaker 
people who lose out in competition . . . and other problems, like environmental 
issues, social welfare." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On voters' attitudes: 
</P>
<P>
 "The LDP was viewed as tainted, rotten. (Former Prime Minister Morihiro) 
Hosokawa didn't have that image at the beginning, and people saw him as a 
change after more than 30 years of LDP rule. . . . (Now) most voters are 
apathetic about politics. There's no crisis facing Japan from the outside. 
Despite the recession, no layoffs have occurred. People don't face a bad 
situation in their daily lives. So they have little interest in politics."

MARKET FOCUS; CANADA DIGS DEEP TO PROP UP OIL DRILLING PLATFORM; HIBERNIA 
PROJECT EMPLOYS 4,000 IN NEWFOUNDLAND. SOME ANALYSTS ARE SKEPTICAL THE 
GOVERNMENT WILL RECOVER ITS INVESTMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For at least as long as such things have been written down, the people of 
Newfoundland have earned their livelihood from the turbulent waters of the 
North Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 They have drawn fish from the sea and they have processed them in small 
factories in the coastal villages of their island. They have repaired the boats 
that carried the fishermen and they have welcomed to their port the ships of 
others from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, they are looking to the ocean for a new resource -- oil. 
</P>
<P>
 On a fog-cloaked construction site cut from the wilderness, more than 4,000 
workers, mainly Newfoundlanders, are building an offshore drilling platform 
large enough and strong enough to withstand not only the pounding storms of the 
North Atlantic, but the occasional iceberg. 
</P>
<P>
 When it is finished, in 1997 if the schedule holds, the platform will be towed 
about 200 miles out to sea to the Hibernia oil field. There it will be 
installed on the ocean floor and begin pumping. By the turn of the century, the 
Hibernia field should account for about 12% of Canada's conventional oil 
production, according to the consortium building the rig. If the adjacent Terra 
Nova offshore field comes on line, Newfoundland's waters could be providing as 
much as a quarter of the country's oil output. 
</P>
<P>
 The project -- projected to cost nearly $11.7 billion to build and operate 
over 20 years -- is as risky and controversial as it is ambitious: 
</P>
<P>
 * No one ever has built an offshore platform to withstand ramming by an 
iceberg. This presented an engineering challenge that was researched at one 
point by landing a small plane on an iceberg and drilling to test for density. 
</P>
<P>
 * There was no facility in Newfoundland that could be adapted for such a 
construction project, so the consortium cleared 4,000 acres of forest and 
bogland along a deep-water cove near the town of Come By Chance. Here, it built 
a factory for building the platform and a town for the workers. The site will 
be turned over to the province for $1 when the platform is completed, in the 
hope that the expertise gained in the Hibernia project will lay the groundwork 
for an offshore industry here. 
</P>
<P>
 This project is under way in a Newfoundland sunk in economic despair. The 
Northern cod that were the mainstay of the fisheries have virtually 
disappeared, and many other fish stocks are so damaged that fishing quotas have 
plunged. In July, the official unemployment rate was 21.1%. Mindful of the need 
for economic diversification, the Canadian government of former Prime Minister 
Brian Mulroney took the unusual step of propping up the Hibernia project with 
$1.24 billion in loan guarantees and a direct investment amounting to 8.5% 
ownership. The new Liberal government of Prime Minister Jean Chretien has stuck 
by the project. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the original partners, Gulf Canada, pulled out in 1992, delaying the 
completion date by a year. Construction costs also have risen more than $875 
million over budget, although the owners say that has been more than offset by 
reductions in projected operating costs attributed to improved technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite estimates by the ownership consortium that the project has a 
break-even point at $13.65 a barrel over the 20-year drilling cycle, some 
analysts are skeptical it will ever recover its investment. This has led to 
snide comments about Hibernia being the biggest make-work project in history. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil company officials wave aside such complaints and say they wouldn't be 
involved in a money loser. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oil companies don't get involved in make-work projects or social development 
programs. They're in it to make money," said Bill Simpkins, the Hibernia 
project's manager of government relations and public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ownership of Hibernia is divided among Mobil Oil (33.125%), Chevron (26.875%), 
Petro-Canada (25%) and Murphy Atlantic (6.5%), in addition to the Canadian 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Bates, a Mobil executive from New Jersey who is general manager of the 
project, says the engineering on the project is essentially an adaptation of 
technology developed for 18 similar platforms in the North Sea. The major 
difference is the reinforcement needed for protection from multimillion-ton 
icebergs. 
</P>
<P>
 The concrete and steel base of the drilling rig, called the gravity-based 
structure, has been designed with 16 "teeth" intended to ward off icebergs and 
protect the platform's inner walls. The steel reinforcement of the concrete, 
called rebar, will be heavier than in the North Sea platforms. 
</P>
<P>
 The structure will be 295 feet tall, with a storage capacity of about 1.3 
million barrels of oil. Four columns, housing the drills and other equipment, 
will run through the platform base and support seven topside modules, derricks, 
lifeboat stations, a helipad and a boom to burn off excess gas. The structure 
will have a living capacity of 280 workers, although the typical population 
will be about 250 once pumping starts. When completed, attached to the ocean 
floor and filled with ballast, the entire structure will weigh about 1.2 
million tons. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the structure is under way in a man-made dry-dock here. Once 
the outer wall of the structure reaches 59 feet in height in October, the 
dry-dock will be flooded and the partially completed gravity-based structure 
will be towed to a deep-water site just offshore and held in place with huge 
mooring chains. There construction will be completed. Work on the topside 
structures is under way here and in South Korea and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes as scheduled, the completed rig should be ready to be floated to 
the drilling site in June, 1997. Because of the weather in the North Atlantic, 
there is only a two-month window for the tow-out. If the window is missed, oil 
production will be delayed a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The thousands of workers building the Hibernia project will, of course, lose 
their jobs when it is complete. The theory behind the partial government 
funding of the project is that it will provide the infrastructure for future 
development of offshore oil or another industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hibernia is really the ground-breaker," said Ken Hull, president of the 
Hibernia Management and Development Co., the firm formed by the consortium to 
run the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Hull notes estimates of more than 600 million barrels of extractable oil in 
the Hibernia field, and there may be more nearby.  
</P>
<P>
 While Hibernia may be an engineering marvel and at least a short-term job 
creator, there are considerable doubts around the nation about the wisdom of 
the government stake in the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Why invest in such a risky, politically driven project when Canada has one of 
the highest public debts, as a percentage of domestic national product, in the 
industrial world, many ask. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, as if to underline those doubts, the Canadian and Alberta 
governments sold at a $730-million loss their interest in a heavy oil upgrader 
project on the Alberta-Saskatchewan border. Although the government is sticking 
with the Hibernia project, Natural Resources Minister Anne McLellan has said 
there will be no repeats. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the most vocal Hibernia critic is Ian Doig of Calgary, publisher of 
an oil and gas newsletter called Doig's Digest. 
</P>
<P>
 Doig argues that government involvement in the project -- to ensure that the 
bulk of the work is done in Newfoundland -- has artificially driven up costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Ziff, president of the Ziff Energy Group, a Calgary consulting firm, said 
Canada has experienced both success and failure with government-assisted energy 
projects, but he notes the inherent unpredictability of the Hibernia project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever you have a new technology, you get surprises, and they're not 
usually pleasant," Ziff said. THE BUILDING OF HIBERNIA 
</P>
<P>
 In order to tap into the resources of the North Atlantic, workers in 
Newfoundland are building an offshore oil platform that can take the pounding 
storms of the North Atlantic, as well as crushing blows from multimillion-ton 
icebergs. The concrete and steel structure making this possible is called the 
gravity-based structure, or GBS. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Hibernia Oil Project 
</P>
<P>
 The GBS is a concrete pedestal that sits on the ocean floor, with 16 "teeth" 
in its exterior wall to absorb the impacts of icebergs. The following diagrams 
show some of the steps in putting the Hibernia oil platform over the drill 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 * Topsides Moved Out 
</P>
<P>
 Once the "topsides," or drilling and production facilities, are completed, 
they are towed out to the GBS. 
</P>
<P>
 * Topsides Mated to GBS 
</P>
<P>
 The topsides are then attached to the GBS, and the whole structure is moved to 
the final drilling site. 
</P>
<P>
 * At the Drill Site 
</P>
<P>
 The oil platform is positioned over the drilling site, and the GBS interior is 
filled, bringing the GBS base to rest on the ocean floor. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Hibernia Drill Site 
</P>
<P>
 The Hibernia oil fields are about 200 miles offshore from St. John's, 
Newfoundland. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oil Production 
</P>
<P>
 Oil companies hope to extract more than 600 million barrels from the Hibernia 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
 * Protecting the Oil Platform 
</P>
<P>
 There are 16 "teeth" that make up the outer ice wall, which are designed to 
protect the inner platform from large icebergs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oil Storage 
</P>
<P>
 The interior of the GBS can hold up to 1.3 million barrels of crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Hibernia Platform 
</P>
<P>
 Topsides facilities: The topsides contain all drilling, crude oil processing 
service and utility requirements for the platform, as well as housing for 280 
people.

 ULTRA SAVINGS: What would happen if the 4.4 million people who visit Anaheim 
Stadium and the city's Convention Center each year were using low-flush toilets 
in their restrooms? The city would save about 23 million gallons of water a 
year, officials say. And that should happen soon. . . . Anaheim has received 
$126,000 in government grants to install 1,070 environmentally correct 
ultra-low-flush toilets and urinals at the two venues. 
</P>
<P>
 WHAT DAY TO DANCE: The Suede Restaurant and Billiards in the Tustin Square 
Shopping Center in Orange had a tough sell to the city Planning Commission -- 
dancing and live music. Owner Mehdi Rafaty got his way, if he restricts it all 
to weekends. So he's pleading with the City Council tonight to let the music 
run weekdays, too. . . . Explains Rafaty: "Some of the more talented 
entertainers are not willing to perform in smaller locations, such as ours, on 
the weekends." . . . . The Planning Commission's response: pool, drinking and 
dancing don't always mix that well. 
</P>
<P>
 PARTY MUSIC: You can understand why members of the Pacific Symphony Orchestra 
are partying tonight: Their new compact disc -- the orchestra's first recording 
in eight years -- is going on sale. Included are two works by Frank Ticheli, 
who is in his third season as the orchestra's composer-in-residence. . . . The 
party begins at 7 tonight at Virgin Megastore at Costa Mesa's Triangle Square. 
And yes, Ticheli and others will be on hand to sign your copy if you buy one.

 OCEAN VIEW: The famous Fontainebleau Hilton in Miami Beach marked the 
turnaround point for the national offshore boat championship Sunday. But Matt 
Alcone of Laguna Beach and Jerry Gilbreath of Santa Ana barely saw it -- they 
passed by at 115 m.p.h. fighting three-foot swells. Alcone drove and Gilbreath 
worked the throttle in the 2,000-horsepower catamaran Gilbreath designed. "It 
was only our second race," says Alcone. "A lot of national champions were left 
shaking their heads."

FIGHT ENDS WITH GUARD SHOT DEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN ELLINGWOOD and REBECCA TROUNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A private security guard who was awaiting a permit to carry a gun was shot to 
death outside a Santa Ana apartment complex early Monday following a dispute 
with a man who was later arrested, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police identified the unarmed guard as Kevin Michael Madden, 28, of 
Montebello, who worked for the Santa Ana-based California West Patrol. Madden 
was shot once in the shoulder and twice in the head by a man he was fighting 
with about 12:20 a.m., Police Lt. Robert Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicolas Nieves, 19, of Santa Ana, was arrested a short time later following a 
brief police chase, Helton said. Nieves was later booked on suspicion of 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Madden was on patrol at the time of the incident. Helton said it was unclear 
what sparked the fight, which erupted after Madden approached Nieves and a 
woman as they talked in the parking lot outside the complex at 710 S. Lyon St. 
The conversation was peaceful at first, then turned into an argument and a 
fistfight, he said. During the fistfight, Helton said, Nieves allegedly pulled 
out a handgun and fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Helton said the three people knew each other, though neither Madden nor Nieves 
lived at the complex. Helton did not identify the woman, who was being 
questioned Monday, but said she is a former girlfriend of Nieves and shares an 
apartment at the complex with Madden's sister. 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship between Nieves and the woman ended about two weeks ago, 
Helton said. "We still don't know the details of what led up to the 
confrontation, but there is a relationship between several of the parties," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nieves was taken into custody following a short chase that ended when he drove 
into a telephone pole at Chestnut and Orange avenues, Helton said. A handgun 
was found along the 1.5-mile chase route, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Madden's supervisor said the encounter also might have stemmed from a 
confrontation between Madden and a friend of Nieves outside a local bar that 
the company patrols. He said that friend, whom he did not identify, was 
arrested after assaulting Madden last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the company's patrol officers, who drive from site to site to back up 
posted guards, carry weapons, said company president James Michaels. Madden, 
who had worked for the firm since 1989, applied for a state permit to carry a 
gun early this year, but was waiting for the permit because of an error by the 
agency that issues them, Michaels said. He said Madden sent back a permit on 
which his name had been misspelled. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a talented guy. He knew what he was doing. He was very knowledgeable and 
very conscientious," Michaels said. Madden is survived by a wife and two 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Echeverria, the patrol company's operations manager, described Madden as 
his closest friend and said the two had grown up together in Montebello. 
</P>
<P>
 "Law enforcement was his life. He wanted to be a cop so bad," Echeverria said, 
his voice breaking. "He wanted to get his feet wet (with this job) so when he 
became a cop, he'd be prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 A security guard was at the Warwick Square apartment complex at the time of 
the incident, but on another part of the property, Michaels said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday morning, small groups of residents huddled in the parking lot or 
just outside the doors of their units, exchanging news of the night's events. 
</P>
<P>
 Claudia Ramirez, 22, and Alma Vidaurreta, 24, stood watching as three men used 
high-pressure hoses to wash down the sidewalks, including the area just inside 
the parking lot entrance where Madden was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Vidaurreta said she and her roommates were awakened soon after midnight by the 
sound of a woman screaming, then several quick gunshots. They ran out of their 
apartment and watched as police officers arrived and questioned two people, a 
man and a woman, who were sitting inside a parked car, Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those interviewed at the complex said they did not plan to move because of 
Monday's shooting. "Most of the time, it's quiet here," Ramirez said. "It's a 
good place to live."  
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Vidaurreta added, it's not easy to escape such violence. "Everywhere, 
it's the same," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several residents said they knew of no other violent incidents at the neatly 
kept, beige and green apartment complex. But one resident, Conchita Masariego, 
33, said a woman had been killed during an incident in the parking lot about 
eight months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Gaboury, vice president of J.F. Shea Co. Inc, which owns the multiunit 
complex, said the earlier incident occurred on the street outside and not on 
the property itself. "We've owned this for about 20 years and there's never 
been anything like" Monday's shooting, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Walnut-based company later announced that it has set up a fund to assist 
Madden's family. Those wishing to donate are asked to call the company at (909) 
598-9000.

CHAPMAN WILL LAY DOWN THE LAW GENTLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kiss the days of a high-stress, ultra-competitive legal education goodby. 
Chapman University is introducing a kinder, gentler version of law school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can become the most user-friendly law school in the country," Jeremy 
Miller, acting dean of Chapman University's new School of Law, said Monday. 
"The majority of law school classes are held in an atmosphere of fear and 
stress. That does not promote learning -- it promotes bad lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller made a promise to the teachers, lawyers and others who had gathered at 
a news conference here that students who enroll in the new school will study 
law in a "positive" atmosphere and instructors will help them all to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman University President James L. Doti added that the law school will seek 
approval by the American Bar Assn. after its first year and will provide an 
alternative for students who don't want to commute out of the county to go to 
an ABA-approved school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shock that it's taken this long for someone to do it," said Franz 
Miller, secretary of the Orange County Bar Assn., who is not related to Jeremy 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Miller said that Orange County is the largest metropolitan area in the 
nation without an ABA-accredited law school. There are six in Los Angeles 
County and two in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
 Western State University College of Law, with campuses in Irvine and 
Fullerton, sought that accreditation unsuccessfully during the mid-1980s. 
Western State spokeswoman Val Bagarozzi said the college is satisfied with 
accreditation by the Committee of Bar Examiners of the State Bar of California. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 American Bar Assn. officials said accreditation depends on a school's 
financial security, a good library and other factors. There are 176 such 
approved schools nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Graduates of ABA-approved schools may sit for the bar in any state, Chapman 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doti said the school will open in September, 1995, in leased office space in 
the South Coast Metro area. And as an economist, Doti was quick to point out 
the school's projected impact on the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "From now until the year 2000, it will produce a $65-million direct economic 
impact," Doti said. That will come from salaries, building costs and other 
expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 The university will launch a $22-million fund-raising drive to pay for the 
school. Most of that will pay for land and a building that will house the law 
school, which must have an area of at least 100,000 square feet -- the size of 
Chapman's Argyros Forum -- to satisfy accreditation guidelines, Doti said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman will spend about $13 million in the next three years to start the 
school, Doti said. About $8.3 million will come from law student tuition and 
the university will chip in $5.3 million, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Law school tuition will be about $17,000 a year, similar to undergraduate 
tuition, Doti said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman Law School administrators will recruit students from Orange County at 
first and later spread recruiting efforts to other counties and elsewhere in 
the nation. The school will emphasize international business and tax law and 
ethics, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doti said he and other officials chose Jeremy Miller as acting dean because of 
his vision for the law school. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "When he talks about a user-friendly environment, he talks about a place where 
law is fun and exciting," Doti said. "There will always be pressure in law 
school. It's a tough education, with a lot of demands and very high 
expectations . . . but it can be a place where faculty treat students as 
individuals." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who taught for more than 10 years at Western State, said he tries to 
emphasize the compelling facets of law. He's published several tapes and books, 
such as "Everything You Wanted to Know About Criminal Law But Were Afraid to 
Ask." 
</P>
<P>
 Law isn't just about cases and trials, said Miller, who teaches ethics. "It's 
about problems, divorce and broken lives. . . . It's about people, not facts." 
</P>
<P>
 Lest students think it will be an easy ride, Miller issues a warning: Students 
will have to write. A lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lawyers, as intelligent as we are, have room for improvement in our writing 
ability," he said. Every first-year law class will have a writing component. 
</P>
<P>
 The new dean also plans to bring Western State's pro bono legal work 
requirement to Chapman. As a teacher at Western State, he helped start a policy 
requiring new students to volunteer free legal services for the needy to 
graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 Doti said the law school means a new credo for his campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's official today," Doti said, "there will be no more lawyer jokes at 
Chapman University." A Kinder, Gentler Law School

"THIS IS THE WHOLE BALLGAME."; LAGUNA PUTS UP A GRAND CANYON FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is beautiful and serene, this rolling wilderness that has helped keep 
coastal Laguna Beach both physically and spiritually apart from the outside 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents are fond of saying that driving through winding, rustic Laguna 
Canyon at the end of the day is like sipping a martini. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet when speaking of the beloved canyon -- one of only two routes into the 
community -- much local sentiment is tinged with anger and pain. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because for 25 years, many residents have fought doggedly to protect 
the canyon from development. And now, it seems, only the outcome of a hearing 
in federal appeals court today can block a six-lane toll road from being 
bulldozed through the canyon and the Laguna Coast Wilderness Park to link 
Newport Beach and San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called San Joaquin Hills project stirs uncommon passion in this city, a 
liberal bastion that boasts a noted artist colony and has conservative Orange 
County's only ordinance banning discrimination against gays. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been literally a fight for my way of life," said Mark Chamberlain, 
an artist who has worked to save the canyon since 1969. "I feel strongly enough 
that if the (toll) road goes through, I'll be looking to leave. . . . I'll have 
done my best, given my best effort to it, and I'll figure it's time to move on. 
And I know a lot of people who are thinking of it like that." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is another, more silent segment of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not as outspoken as environmentalists, there are Laguna Beach 
residents who commute elsewhere to their jobs and believe the toll road is 
desperately needed to ease the area's maddening and chronic traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very vocal in our opinion . . . (that) there must be a group of people 
who feel like we do, desiring the San Joaquin Hills toll road," said Laguna 
Beach Taxpayers Assn. President Robert R. Mosier. "It's the only way the 
traffic in Laguna Beach on Coast Highway will be reduced." 
</P>
<P>
 The question before the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals is this: 
</P>
<P>
 Did the Federal Highway Administration conduct a full and proper environmental 
review before approving the toll road in July, 1992? 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.1-billion project, which is overseen by the San Joaquin Hills 
Transportation Corridor Agency, will be 17 miles long from Newport Beach to San 
Juan Capistrano. The challenge by environmental groups, led by Laguna Greenbelt 
Inc., concerns a 4.7-mile link through the Laguna Canyon area. Work on other 
sections of the road has proceeded since September, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The court's ruling will determine whether the project goes ahead through the 
canyon or whether there must be further environmental review that could change 
the toll road's route. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sense is, everybody's eyes are turned to (today) and holding out some hope 
we'll get a favorable ruling from the appeals courts," Laguna Canyon 
Conservancy director Mike Phillips said. "I think people know this is the whole 
ballgame, right now." 
</P>
<P>
 So this may be the last big battle over the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Stuart, a wisp of a warrior at 5 feet, 2 inches and not quite 80 
pounds, remembers the first campaign to preserve the canyon. It was in 1969, 
when a handful of residents led by local bookstore owner Jim Dilley agreed that 
a band of greenery should rim the city. The canyon would be the centerpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart, a 78-year-old former ballet dancer, joined Laguna Greenbelt Inc. six 
months after it was formed and served as the group's treasurer for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "People thought I'd taken up karate because they simply didn't know anything 
about a 'greenbelt' in those days," she said. "It took . . . a lot of time, a 
lot of work. But it always seemed worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 Chamberlain was another early enlistee. Back then, development -- a "mass of 
homogenization" -- was creeping toward the city from the north and south, he 
said. The greenbelt, including the canyon, "was the only thing that kept Laguna 
separate from the Orange Empire." 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who lived here at the time realized this was an oasis," 
Chamberlain said. "And the only way to keep it that way was to have the buffer 
between us." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, as the Irvine Co. prepared to build the Laguna Laurel housing 
development in the canyon, City Councilwoman Lida Lenney, an environmentalist, 
gathered a small group around her and formed the Laguna Canyon Conservancy to 
help continue the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 After seeking support from throughout the county, the group tasted a 
surprisingly sweet victory when, on Nov. 11, 1989, between 7,000 and 8,000 
people converged on Laguna Beach for a "Save The Canyon" march. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon afterward, the city and the developer crafted an agreement allowing 
Laguna Beach to buy the land in patches and preserve it as open space. 
</P>
<P>
 But conservancy director Phillips admits this ceaseless struggle is taxing for 
the troops. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the efforts to save the canyon become very wearing after a while -- 
countless meetings to go to, we always have to be conscious of raising money 
and you're always operating under a sense of being threatened," he said. "Every 
time there's a threat to the canyon, we have to win. The development interests 
and the road builders only have to win once." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some who oppose the toll road say it is time to hoist the white flag. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality is, the battle is over," said Darren Esslinger, whose family owns 
a mobile home park in Laguna Beach. "I think a lot of people are confused in 
this city, (thinking) somehow they can affect some kind of change to the plan. 
But it is really out of their hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the community are fatigued, still reeling from a firestorm last Oct. 
27 that damaged or destroyed more than 400 homes and scorched thousands of 
acres of open space. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the protest against the toll road continues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very emotional issue," said Kurt Topik, who has lived in Laguna Beach 
for three decades. After years of protesting, letter writing and giving money 
to the cause, Topik, 74, doesn't fancy backing down now. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to make a stand someplace," he said. "I'm a pretty old guy to be 
standing in front of a bulldozer, but I might still do that. I'm very angry. 
And if they want to lock me up, well, that's OK, too." 
</P>
<P>
 In what may have been a preview of a continuing drama, both bulldozers and 
protesters raced to the canyon June 14 after a judge ruled grading could begin. 
As the first row of tractors rolled over the hill that afternoon, protesters 
swore, wept and wailed. 
</P>
<P>
 The protest widened as the sun set and other city officials ended their work 
day and joined the ranks. The city clerk and a planning commissioner took turns 
carrying placards. The next day, a second court order halted the grading and 
set the crucial Sept. 13 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, road opponents have worked steadily behind the scenes, staging 
intermittent protests, including one last weekend that drew more than 1,000 
people into the canyon to hear music, poetry readings and pleas from speakers 
to preserve the land. Hundreds left carrying postcards to mail to elected 
officials opposing the toll road. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach Police Chief Neil J. Purcell Jr. said that in his 26 years on the 
force he's seen nothing rile locals like an issue felt to be a threat to the 
canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some people who think demonstrators will be out there a day or two, 
and they'll get tired, hot, hungry, cold -- whatever the case may be -- but 
that they'll be done in a couple days," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Purcell disagrees: "They will be out there opposing it, even on opening day of 
the toll road."

COUNTY GANG CRIME -- BY THE NUMBERS; SURVEY: ATTEMPT TO CREATE DATABASE FOR 
AUTHORITIES SHOWS ACTIVITY IS NOT CENTERED ON DRUGS AND NOT CONFINED TO CITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN ELLINGWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Serious crimes by gang members most often victimize average people -- except 
for homicides, which are usually committed against other gang members, 
according to a police tabulation of gang-related incidents released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 To authorities' surprise, the countywide survey of 1,711 gang incidents 
tracked by police in the first half of 1994 also showed that gang crime is not 
centered on drug sales or drug-related activity. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the survey found that nearly half of these incidents were 
committed by adults, and that the most common crimes were those directed 
against people -- including murders, assaults, drive-by shootings and 
robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, launched by the Orange County Chiefs' and Sheriff's Assn. last 
year, marks the first attempt to compile Orange County gang incidents to create 
a database for guiding and measuring efforts to fight gang crime, said 
Westminster Police Chief James Cook, who heads the group's anti-gang committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community or innocent victims are the ones who suffer from gang 
violence," Cook said at a news conference called to announce the results for 
the first six months of 1994. The session was attended by more than two dozen 
police chiefs, county law-enforcement officials and local elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The report -- based on figures from all 31 cities and unincorporated county 
land -- makes no attempt to conclude whether current efforts to curb gangs are 
working. But it paints a picture of gang crime that penetrates throughout the 
county and is both more violent and complex than law-enforcement officials had 
thought, authorities said. About 300 Orange County gangs include an estimated 
18,000 members, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey analyzed gang-related incidents through June, finding an average of 
285 a month. Each incident may involve several crimes. Crimes were included in 
the database if the investigating officers concluded it was a gang-related 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Police classify a crime as gang- related based on a number of ground rules, 
including whether a suspect admits to gang membership, has been identified as a 
gang member by a reliable informant or associates with and dresses like a gang 
member. Community groups have sometimes criticized police as being too quick to 
label some incidents as gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 In finding that gang crime has a significant impact on people who are 
uninvolved with gangs, the study made an effort to identify the relationship 
between victims and suspects in serious crimes, such as robberies, assaults and 
murders. In the 885 cases where that relationship was known, 58% involved "an 
innocent or unintended victim," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, that number dropped drastically when it came to murder, where 
rival gang members were victims in all but four of the 22 homicides involving 
gang members in the first six months of 1994. (In the first nine months of 
1994, there were 42 gang-related murders. There were 74 in all of 1993.) 
</P>
<P>
 The report also found that 52% of gang crime can be classified as crimes 
against persons -- such as assault and robbery -- and that 45% were property 
crimes, such as tagging and vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said many law-enforcement officials previously had believed that 
gang attacks are directed primarily against rival groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook pointed to an incident during the weekend in which a Westminster woman 
was critically wounded when she was caught in a gang shootout in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "All she was guilty of is being in the wrong place at the wrong time," Cook 
said. Police are most surprised that 3% of the cases, or 52 gang incidents, 
involved narcotics. Authorities had believed a large share of gang crime 
involved drug sales. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The public perception is that that was the driving force for the gangs," said 
Sheriff Brad Gates. "It appears that's not the reason for gang involvement in 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said authorities have also noticed a new generation of gang nomads: 
those with no attachment to a single group or home turf, motivated purely by 
moneymaking. Often, he said, these are the ones who carry out home-invasion 
robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 The data also produced some good news for police: arrests arising from gang 
incidents often take place within two days. About 45% of the incidents 
tabulated ended with an early arrest, a figure about twice that for other 
crimes, Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Police Chief Paul M. Walters said the countywide data show gang 
crime everywhere, not only in cities where gangs are entrenched. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, figures for Orange County pale in comparison with Los Angeles County, 
where more than 19,300 gang incidents were reported in the first six months of 
1994. Of those, 250 were homicides -- more than 10 times the 22 reported for 
Orange County. Orange County has 2.4 million people, while Los Angeles County 
has 8.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Law-enforcement officials in Orange County said having a tally of gang crime 
will help them deploy officers more effectively. But Cook and others said such 
efforts will not succeed without a multi-pronged approach that includes 
schools, community and business groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The database, called the gang incident tracking system, will be compiled and 
released quarterly and will be available to the public.  
</P>
<P>
 The police chiefs' group had first debated whether to publicize the figures, 
Cook said, wondering whether a frequent report card on the extent of gang crime 
might depict police as ineffectual against gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time we have had the data that says we have at least this much 
gang crime and can prove it," Cook said in an interview. "We felt it was time 
the citizens of Orange County had the truth, and here's the numbers." Gang 
Violence Targets People People rather than property were the main targets of 
gangs during the first half of 1994. Relatively few gang crimes involved drug 
sales, and the victims of their crimes were more often than not innocent 
parties. * Crime Targets People: 52% Drug sales: 3% Property: 45% * Victims* 
Innocent party: 58% Other: 12% Police officer: 2% Rival gang member: 17% 
Acquaintance: 11% * Serious crimes, excluding graffti and vadalism Source:

RACE-TINGED CASE DRAWS STIFFER CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's office filed additional charges Monday 
of attempted murder in an attack on a black high school student, but rejected 
calls by a judge and minority leaders to prosecute the case as a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Matthew Anderson said there was insufficient evidence to 
prove race was a motivating factor in the Aug. 5 assault on 15-year-old Ruben 
Charles Vaughan III of Tustin, who was beaten unconscious, stabbed seven times 
and suffered a broken nose and jaw. Moments before, an assailant allegedly 
yelled "Get the nigger!," an investigator for the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department has testified. 
</P>
<P>
 The assault on Vaughan, then a student and athlete at Santa Margarita High 
School, sparked a protest by a coalition of Asian, black and Latino leaders who 
criticized prosecutors' handling of hate-crime cases and urged tougher charges 
than those originally filed against Vaughan's alleged attackers. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson reviewed the case and filed attempted murder and other charges 
against two young men Monday, but said the filing decision wasn't based on 
community outrage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a decision on the facts in the case," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attempted murder charges satisfied Eugene M. Wheeler, who, as president of 
the 100 Black Men of Orange County, was among those upset by how the Vaughan 
case was being treated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understand it is difficult to get a conviction on a hate crime and the 
district attorney's office might feel they do not have enough to prove it," 
Wheeler said Monday. "Upgrading the charges to attempted murder is something we 
are pleased with because that's what we were hoping for all along." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan and his father, Melvin Aaron, could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials believe Vaughan, who now attends Foothill High 
School, was not an intended target, but was caught in the midst of a "turf war" 
involving the alleged attackers -- graduates or students of El Toro High School 
-- who have a long running rivalry with Santa Margarita students. 
</P>
<P>
 But during an Aug. 30 preliminary hearing in Laguna Niguel, Municipal Judge 
Pamela L. Iles urged prosecutors to consider filing hate-crime charges against 
Derek Thomas Jones, 20, of Huntington Beach and Russell Takeo Scarce, 19, of 
Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Iles said she believed there was more to the fight than high school rivalry. 
"They didn't say 'Get the Santa Margarita guy,' they said 'Get the nigger,' " 
she said at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones and Scarce pleaded not guilty to the charges Monday in Orange County 
Superior Court. They also face felony charges of assault with a deadly weapon 
and battery resulting in serious bodily injury in connection with the attack on 
Vaughan. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted of all the charges, they could each face up to 13 years in 
prison. An additional hate-crime charge would not add prison time to a maximum 
sentence, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 16-year-old also faces charges in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Jones and Scarce disagreed with the new charges Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's an attempted-murder case," said Deputy Public Defender 
Michael B. McClellan. McClellan also said an attack is not always racially 
motivated even if racial epithets are made. He said many of the alleged 
assailants were Asian and Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 Scarce is also half Asian, said his defense attorney James S. Sweeney. "He's 
not the type of guy who would commit a crime like this," said Sweeney, who said 
there is evidence Vaughan was also looking for a fight that night. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's evidence that (Vaughan) and the others had taken off their shirts, 
which is sort of a symbol of 'Let's fight,' " Sweeney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineer William R. Scarce said his son was being unfairly portrayed as a 
racist. He said Vaughan should never have been injured but that he and his 
friends were also looking for a fight the night of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole thing is very unfair," Scarce said.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ORANGE; SPORTS SITE TO EMERGE AT OLD SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trucks already are hauling mountains of dirt around the grounds of what was 
once the Peralta Middle School as part of a project to transform it into a 
giant sports facility that will open early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange Unified School District last month gave Super Sports Inc. a 20-year 
lease for the school, which has been closed for nearly 10 years and more 
recently had become the haunt of vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Manhattan Beach-based Super Sports said the 21-acre site will 
still attract local youngsters, but for the more acceptable activities of 
Little League practice, roller hockey and soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 Adults who had worried about the derelict site can look forward to a 64-stall 
golf driving range, a community center, a running course -- complete with 
exercise stations -- and a child care center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty complete facility," said Peter Moersch, marketing director for 
Super Sports, of the property behind the Orange Mall at Meats Avenue and Canal 
Street. "The goal in doing all this is to give the kids something more 
productive to do with their time. . . . There are some problems with kids at 
the mall loitering, and the neighbors are a little afraid that gangs are in the 
neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials had consulted closely with nearby homeowners before giving 
the lease to Super Sports. "The Super Sports project was the one the neighbors 
preferred," said Joyce Capelle, the district's chief fiscal officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Rent for the facility is based on income, so the district's profit will rise 
and fall with the fortunes of Super Sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Moersch said the 13-year-old company is pouring millions of dollars into the 
site to ensure its success. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to make this the highest-quality sporting facility," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reclaiming the campus would have cost the strapped district about $3 million, 
officials said. LESLEY WRIGHT

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; NORTHWOOD PARK PLANS ON AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council tonight will continue a nearly decade-old discussion, 
reviewing plans to create a park in Northwood village on a long-abandoned 
railroad right of way owned by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks about converting the 1 1/2-mile-long strip of land into a park began 
soon after the railroad abandoned a route adjacent to the site about 10 years 
ago, according to Mayor Michael Ward.The Irvine Co. donated the property to the 
city after it was no longer required by the railroad. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials had proposed selling the land to nearby homeowners whose back 
yards abut the property, but too few homeowners were willing to purchase the 
land. 
</P>
<P>
 Because city officials thought the proposed park would be mostly of benefit to 
nearby homeowners, the previous City Council tried to create an assessment 
district that would have tapped nearby residents for park construction costs. 
The move failed. 
</P>
<P>
 After numerous discussions among residents and city officials earlier this 
year, the council is poised to choose one of three plans for the park, with 
costs ranging from $2.2 million to $2.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents are asking for low-mounted park lighting to prevent light from 
shining into nearbyhomes. But the lower height of the fixtures would reduce the 
amount of light, requiring additional lights and increasing the cost from 
$91,000 to as much as $554,000, according to a city report. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever plan is approved, the question of how to fund the park will remain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may build the park in phases," Ward said. "The big thing has always been 
the design."RUSS LOAR

 The City Council is considering a plan to consolidate some resident advisory 
panels to save money on support work and on the amount of time city employees 
work with the panels. 
</P>
<P>
 The city spends an estimated $326,000 a year on employee support for more than 
40 committees, boards and commissions, in addition to the $20,590 in committee 
budgets, according to Assistant City Manager Ken Delino. 
</P>
<P>
 In-house committees are often the City Council's conduit to the community on a 
variety of subjects ranging from economic development and environmental quality 
to bike trails and youth activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also participates in regional committees like the Southern California 
Assn. of Governments to monitor issues like employment and housing. Newport 
Beach and Fullerton are the only Orange County members of SCAG. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the committees are permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 At Monday's meeting, council members asked city officials to look into 
consolidating the bicycle trails committee with the parks, beaches and 
recreation commission, the hazardous waste committee with the environmental 
quality affairs committee, and eliminating any city committees that have 
outlived their original missions.HOLLY J. WAGNER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; LOW-FLOOR BUSES WILL HELP ELDERLY, DISABLED 
GET ABOARD

 Taking the bus is about to become less of a struggle for the thousands of 
disabled and elderly passengers who rely on the Orange County Transportation 
Authority to get around. 
</P>
<P>
 The OCTA purchased 50 buses with low floors that are just a few inches above 
the curb.Riders will be able to board the new buses without climbing up several 
steps, as they must now do on existing coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The new buses also will be easier for wheelchair users to board, OCTA 
spokesman John Standiford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most existing buses have an elaborate ramp and hydraulic lift system for 
wheelchairs that takes several minutes to operate. The lift systems also 
require frequent maintenance, Standiford said. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the low-floor buses contain a less complicated ramp that can be 
activated easily to provide a straight path onto the coach, Standiford said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a (very) simple ramp. It gets passengers on smoothly and quickly," he 
said. "It's a big advantage to people with mobility impairments." 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA bus wheelchair ramps were used about 75,000 times last year, and use is 
expected to increase as the county's van service for the disabled is 
discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
 The OCTA spent $11.5 million to purchase the 50 buses. The 40-foot coaches 
will debut in mid-1995.SHELBY GRAD

 District's Use of Drug-Sniffing Dogs Expected 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport-Mesa Unified School District is expected to approve a plan tonight 
to use drug-sniffing dogs from the Costa Mesa Police Department to sniff around 
high school students' lockers for illegal substances. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for a fall semester program of random scent-searches of 
lockers, gym locker rooms and student parking lots at Costa Mesa and Estancia 
high schools and the district's Alternative Education Center.All are in Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 If the plan is approved, the program would begin at Costa Mesa High School 
because students and parents have been notified. 
</P>
<P>
 Extending the program to Newport Harbor and Corona del Mar high schools, which 
are outside the jurisdiction of the Costa Mesa Police Department, has not been 
discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach Police Department has agreed to cooperate if the program is 
extended districtwide, said school district spokeswoman Nadine Wilck. 
</P>
<P>
 The district and Costa Mesa police are promoting the plan as a deterrent to 
students who might bring drugs onto campuses. A similar effort in Huntington 
Beach reduced the drug presence once the searches begin, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 People would not be subject to sniff searches under any circumstances. If a 
dog alerts the handler of possible drugs in a locker, the locker will be opened 
and searched, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 If drugs were found, administrators would determine whether the drugs were for 
personal use or for sale and then police would take action. HOLLY J. WAGNER

<P>
 New regulations on testing for tuberculosis bacteria helped make 
back-to-school immunization clinics busier than usual at Tustin Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 Free clinics for school-age children and preschoolers were held Monday and 
last Wednesday, the day before classes started. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never been so crowded," said Margo Stone, nurse coordinator for the 
school district. All first-grade students and any students new to Orange County 
schools were required to show proof of receiving a tuberculosis skin test 
within the last 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The new regulations, she said, have "really increased attendance at our 
clinics." 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 13,000 students enrolled in the Tustin district, which serves 
preschoolers through high school seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides offering tuberculosis testing, the district immunizes children against 
diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio, measles, mumps and rubella. 
</P>
<P>
 From October through June, the school district will offer free immunization 
clinics to Tustin area residents of all ages. This expanded program will be 
held in conjunction with the Orange County Health Care Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinics will generally be conducted from 1 to 3:30 p.m. on the second 
Monday of the month at Guin Foss School, a district resource center at 18492 
Vanderlip Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information on the clinics, call the district at (714) 730-7322.ALAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: PLACENTIA YORBA LINDA; SCHOOL BUS RIDERS GIVE PROGRAM A

 When 5-year-old Bethany Kishiyama boards the yellow school bus that will take 
her to the first day of kindergarten this morning, it won't be a brand-new 
routine for her or her parents, thanks to a get-acquainted-with-the-bus program 
at Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, an expansion of one begun last year on a pilot basis, is designed 
to introduce kindergartners and their parents to bus safety rules, as well as 
give both drivers and students a chance to meet.  
</P>
<P>
 "The first day of school is hectic enough," said driver Lupe Falls. "This 
gives me a chance to learn their names before all the commotion starts." 
</P>
<P>
 Falls and the students also had a chance to test the district's new method for 
ensuring that both kindergarten students and drivers know where they get off 
the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, every kindergarten bus rider will be issued a wristband color-coded 
for the correct stop. 
</P>
<P>
 If a child tries to get off the bus at the wrong stop, Falls and other drivers 
in the district should spot the mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Bednar, transportation director for the district, hopes Monday's 
practice run and the color-coded wrist bands will prevent tragic accidents such 
as the one that occurred this year in South County when a student was killed as 
he mistakenly got off the bus at the wrong stop and was struck by a car. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we want to prevent any tragedy from happening," Bednar said. "We 
think this program will do that, as well as take the apprehension out of the 
minds of the kindergartners and the parents." 
</P>
<P>
 After Monday's practice ride, Nancy Woodbury said her son, Christopher, would 
be ready for his first ride alone on the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not so sure about me, though," she said. "I'll probably drive behind the 
bus, watching him, all the way to school." DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

 Businessmen to Fight Eviction 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of at least two of four businesses left in downtown's El Peon Plaza say 
they plan to fight eviction, and one contends that the city's sale of the 
property earlier this year, along with the way he has been treated, bode 
financial ruin for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm losing everything," said Musa Sharaf, who runs Cynthia's Tea Room & 
Bakery. "I always paid rent on time. The city should be trying to help small 
businesses, not put them out on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the city gave Sharaf a three-day notice to move out, contending 
that his sublease was no longer valid. The City Council has voted to end its 
lease with Mike Darnold, from whom Sharaf sublets the building where his 
business is located. City Atty. Richard K. Denhalter said Darnold "abandoned" 
his lease with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The three remaining businesses in the complex have month-to-month agreements 
with the city, and at least one does not plan to go quietly. 
</P>
<P>
 Escrow could close in seven to 10 days on the El Peon Plaza property, which 
occupies a block across from Mission San Juan Capistrano. The area will undergo 
a $2-million renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to force us out, put pressure on us." said Al Whelchel, who 
owns Cafe Capistrano in the El Peon Plaza. But Whelchel said he intends to stay 
"until they throw us out." 
</P>
<P>
 Denhalter denied the city is trying to toss remaining tenants out before the 
sale closes escrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Nordeck, one of the project's partners, said the three tenants with city 
rental agreements will probably receive 30-day notices from him when escrow 
closes. Nordeck said the evictions are necessary because work will be done to 
strengthen the buildings to comply with earthquake codes. 
</P>
<P>
 The tenants may reapply for new leases once the property is finished, although 
prices will probably be higher, Nordeck said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nordeck said he hopes to complete work on the complex in time for St. Joseph's 
Day, March 19, when the swallows make their annual return to the mission.JEFF

 Where does the money go? 
</P>
<P>
 Some may question how finances can be considered "tight" in a school district 
spending nearly $100 million this school year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 21,500-student Irvine Unified School District, most of the 
$98.7-million budget is spent on employee salaries and benefits, similar to 
public school districts throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 In Irvine, 80% of the budget, or $79 million, will go to district teachers and 
classified employees. About $2.9 million -- or 3% of the budget -- will be 
spent on supplies for the district's 31 schools. Today 
</P>
<P>
 Today is the last time the Fullerton Downtown Planning Committee will meet to 
review design guidelines for the city's downtown. The nine-member group was 
created by the City Council to study designs for businesses and come up with 
recommendations to improve the downtown economic environment, city officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the guidelines committee members will discuss at today's meeting 
include signs, architecture, landscaping and trees. The public is encouraged to 
attend the meeting, which will be at Rutabegorz Restaurant, 211 Pomona Ave., at 
7 p.m.

 After seeing the city recreation staff struggle to operate in the cramped 
Community Center building and adjacent trailer in Crown Valley Park, the City 
Council has decided to investigate building an addition to the center. 
</P>
<P>
 The council agreed last week to pay Design Arc Architects $3,200 to study the 
feasibility of adding offices and a second community multipurpose room to the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 In budget discussions this summer, officials recommended installing a rented, 
double-wide trailer to provide more room for the expanding recreation staff. 
</P>
<P>
 But the council rejected that idea, saying the money would be better spent 
studying and designing an expansion to the current building. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is considering adding 2,000 to 4,000 square feet of space to the 
community center. City Manager Tim Casey said the study should be completed in 
less than a month.LYNN FRANEY

<TEXT>
<P>
 After almost a year of planning, discussion and sometimes heated debate, 
nearly 100 College Park West residents celebrated the completion of a sand 
volleyball court at Edison Park. Construction of the court was the first 
accomplishment of a grass-roots group working to renew the 30-year-old park. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite objections from neighbors, the City Council approved plans in July to 
build the volleyball court and refurbish the playground. A group of College 
Park West residents has raised more than $6,000 to pay for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "The primary benefit is to have an attractive, safe and inviting place for our 
children to play," said resident Lisa Chattler, a leader of the 20-member 
Edison Park Improvement Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 But other residents who live near the park opposed construction of the 
volleyball court because of concerns about increased noise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they still feel how they did in the past," said Mayor George Brown, 
who attended the picnic and dedication ceremonies Saturday. "Whether people at 
this park will make too much noise, only time will tell." 
</P>
<P>
 The new volleyball court is the first improvement at the park in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood group is now working to raise between $15,000 and $18,000 for 
new playground equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The playground equipment there is nearly 30 years old," Chattler said. "The 
children don't want to use it, and I wouldn't want my 2-year-old to go on it. 
It's the stuff I played on when I was a kid." 
</P>
<P>
 The local Seaside and Host Lions Clubs and Junior Women's Club have pledged 
funds to purchase two picnic tables for the park at a cost of $500 each. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Edison Park booster group has planned a fund-raising neighborhood yard 
and bake sale at the park from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Sept. 24. RUSS LOAR

LEGAL AID ATTACKS SANTA ANA RESTRICTIONS ON HOMELESS; COURTS: LAWYER SAYS 
CAMPING BAN TARGETING CIVIC CENTER WOULD MAKE HOMELESSNESS A CRIME. CITY 
ATTORNEY ARGUES NO, IT SIMPLY BARS THEM FROM SETTING UP LIVING QUARTERS. 
</P>

<P>
 Arguing that a municipal ordinance effectively banishes the homeless from 
Santa Ana, an attorney representing them urged a Superior Court judge Monday to 
strike down the law. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney asked the judge to enjoin the city from enforcing the ordinance 
on the grounds that it leaves the homeless with no place in the city where they 
can live lawfully. 
</P>
<P>
 If the law is upheld, "Santa Ana can make it a crime to be homeless and then 
drive the homeless out of the city. All that will do is make homelessness 
someone else's problem," said attorney Harry Simon of the Legal Aid Society. 
</P>
<P>
 But Santa Ana City Atty. Edward J. Cooper argued that the ordinance, which 
allows police to cite and remove homeless people from the Civic Center area, 
does not banish the homeless. It merely prohibits them from setting up living 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance is necessary to ensure the unimpaired functioning of day-to-day 
business at the Civic Center, he said, adding that "we are not going to allow 
this kind of activity." 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Robert J. Polis said that he would announce his decision Wednesday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 90-minute hearing, Simon argued that the problem with the law "is 
not that it closes off the Civic Center. The problem is that it closes off the 
last available place that homeless people can go." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what to tell my clients except, 'Leave the city of Santa Ana, or 
face the possibility of arrest.' Leaving the homeless with no place to go 
punishes homelessness," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper responded, however, that the ordinance "doesn't banish them from the 
city. It doesn't ban them from the Civic Center area. It simply says they can't 
set up camp there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper also attacked the suggestion that "homeless people have no place to go. 
I'm not so sure about that. We have shelters in Santa Ana. We have shelters in 
the county run by nonprofit organizations." 
</P>
<P>
 Simon ridiculed that argument, saying that there are only about 300 shelter 
beds citywide for a homeless population estimated at 3,000 people or more. 
Therefore, 90% of the city's homeless would have no place they could sleep 
without violating the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Homeless people who can't find shelter will be subject to arrest for up to 
six months in County Jail," he said.

CYPRESS MOURNS RESIDENT KILLED IN USAIR CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David D. Garber, a city resident who was killed in the crash of a USAir jet 
near Pittsburgh, Pa., on Sept. 6, was remembered during a brief ceremony that 
opened Monday's City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 In a solemn opening to the meeting, Mayor Richard Partin praised Garber, a 
two-term member of the city Traffic Commission, for his service to the city, 
and said residents mourned his loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Garber was one of 132 people who perished when the aircraft suddenly plummeted 
to earth a few miles from the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Garber, who was first appointed to the commission in 1987, showed a special 
interest in creating and maintaining city bicycle trails, Partin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "God bless you, David," Partin said. "We're going to miss you."

GROUP AGREES TO STOP ILLEGAL WILD-GAME MEAT SALE, PAY FINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The organizers of an annual wild-game barbecue have agreed to stop illegally 
selling the meat of animals such as elk, deer, fish and birds and pay $30,000 
to settle a civil lawsuit filed by the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the most just and fair way of resolving this," Deputy Dist. 
Atty.Matthew Anderson said of the settlement between the county and The Wild 
Game Feed Inc. "The remedy . . . seems to address the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the organization's president, Howard Clark, nor its attorney, Michael 
Quigley, could be reached for comment late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit stemmed from a $75-a-plate barbecue the organization planned last 
September near Irvine Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators from the state Department of Fish and Game and the U.S. Wildlife 
Service -- some with guns drawn -- descended on the site in cars and 
helicopters before the barbecue began. Their investigation eventually revealed 
the presence of some illegal meat. Event organizers later chose to cancel the 
barbecue, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials became suspicious, Anderson said, after seeing flyers advertising 
the sale of meat from fish, deer, elk, mountain lion, black bear and "exotic 
pig." 
</P>
<P>
 State law prohibits the sale of wild game in California. Fish caught under the 
authority of a sportfishing, rather than a commercial, license also cannot be 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit charged the organization with conducting the unlawful business 
practice of selling meat proscribed by Fish and Game regulations and false or 
misleading advertising for promising to sell some meats -- such as mountain 
lion and black bear -- which were not actually available at the event. 
</P>
<P>
 In the settlement, reached Friday, the organization also agreed to reimburse 
the state Department of Fish and Game $3,790 for the cost of its investigation.

THE HUGHES CUTBACKS; ANXIETY GIVES WAY TO SORROW AT HUGHES; REACTION: WORD OF 
SHUTDOWN BRINGS STRONG EMOTION BOTH AT PLANT AND IN FULLERTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Anguish overtook uncertainty Monday as Hughes Aircraft confirmed the worst for 
its 6,800 workers here: Its sprawling aerospace plant nestled in the rolling 
hills of Fullerton since the late 1950s will be phased out over the next 16 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 The news was delivered via closed circuit television under a big, white tent, 
but it was afterward, inside the two dozen buildings that make up the Hughes 
"campus" here, that a circus of emotions swirled throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
 After months of waiting, employees learned that their lives will be changing 
in the months ahead. It was official -- there will be retirements aplenty, 
layoffs throughout Hughes, and at least a transfer for just about everybody 
else. 
</P>
<P>
 But with no specifics, the announcement was just about the only topic in the 
halls, over the coffee pot, on the plant's electronic mail system, on the 
tennis courts, at the on-site employee park, and on the streets of Fullerton 
outside the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bad day for Fullerton," said Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin, himself a 
former Hughes employee. "If Hughes' selection criteria had been the local 
business climate and community amenities, we would have won hands down, but 
unfortunately its criteria were different," he said after visiting with Hughes 
representatives at City Hall on Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "They stayed away from the C-word, cuts, and just talked about what it means 
to the company's overall strategy," said Mark Quezada of Pico Rivera, who 
talked quickly and angrily through a chain-link fence that separated a flow of 
reporters and other curious people from the circus-style tent where Hughes 
Chairman C. Michael Armstrong spoke to workers via television. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's chaos here today, and nobody's working," said engineer Doug Erickson. 
"Everybody's e-mailing everybody like crazy." Erickson, 35, works at Hughes' 
undersea systems unit in Fullerton, and expects to be offered a transfer to El 
Segundo. But he said, "I really don't want to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson, though, was one of the lucky ones. Many Hughes workers interviewed 
Monday were angry because they did not know whether they would survive the 
layoffs, or when or where they might be transferred. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lengthy question-and-answer session after the company's 10 a.m. 
announcement, Hughes officials said there would be a companywide layoff of 
4,400 people -- most of it next year -- and that Fullerton would bear no more 
than is proportionate share. To employees, the corresponding arithmetic means 
about 900 positions from the Fullerton work force would be eliminated. But the 
company declined to give any specific figures regarding local layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of as many as 700 workers likely to remain at two leased 
buildings, most of the Hughes workers in Fullerton are expected to be relocated 
to other Hughes facilities in El Segundo and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 And union officials added that at least one unit in Fullerton -- the surface 
ship radar section -- would be moved to Tucson. It was unclear how many people 
worked in this section. About 1,000 mainly production workers at the Fullerton 
plant are represented by the Carpenters union; the rest work as non-union 
engineers, computer operators and in other technical or clerical work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to (take), even though we've seen this coming since March," said 
Quezada, referring to the month when Hughes announced the creation of a new 
division that presaged the shutdown. The 38-year-old employee said he had 
worked nearly half of his life at Hughes in Fullerton as a shipping department 
crater and packer, and that he had braced himself for the worst. But like many 
of his co-workers, he had held out hope that the plant would not be shuttered. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers who are laid off will receive 60% of their salary for up to 12 weeks 
after they are dismissed, depending on their length of service, according to a 
severance plan announced Monday. They will also receive company-paid medical 
benefits for three months and $1,000 to help pay for retraining. To encourage 
attrition through retirements, Hughes has told workers that they must set a 
retirement date by Nov. 1 to guarantee their current level of benefits, which 
will not be enhanced after that date. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the somber news, some Hughes workers were simply glad that the dreaded 
announcement day had arrived, and others had scheduled time off after the news 
to smash tennis balls or to lobby volleyballs at a family park on the hilly 
Hughes campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're having an outing to blow off steam," said senior staff engineer John 
Heslin as he headed to the park, racket in hand. "It's better than sitting 
around morosely." 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of curious retired and former Hughes workers showed up at the 
37-year-old plant Monday, and many others throughout the city with links to 
Hughes passed the day anxiously as they waited for information on the 
consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan French, 78, was among the first 200 people who worked at Hughes when the 
company opened in Fullerton in 1957. The engineer had long ago retired, but his 
son, Anthony French, was among the second-generation Hughes workers at 
Fullerton. When the elder French received a call from his son late Monday 
morning, he knew from his voice that the news was grim. "I feel so sorry for 
them," was all Stan French could say. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the workers, officials at City Hall and throughout Orange County were on 
edge Monday. Early on, Fullerton and county officials had lobbied Hughes, 
arguing that it was cheaper to operate in Fullerton than at the company's 
plants in El Segundo or Long Beach, which also were studied for a possible 
shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
 But by late morning, Fullerton officials learned from a two-page fax 
confirmation that their pitch was unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 Catlin and other city officials knew that the Fullerton plant was vulnerable 
because it sits on 350 acres of prime real estate. Indeed, Hughes' announcement 
Monday confirmed that the company would put most of the site -- valued at well 
above $75 million -- up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Wedin, chairman of the Orange County Economic Development Consortium and 
a member of the so-called Red Team to retain Hughes, said he was rather 
surprised by Hughes' announcement, having expected a realignment rather than an 
outright closure in Fullerton. But he said the county and the city of Fullerton 
must focus their energy on rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 "If all the property is vacated, we have the opportunity to replace the site 
and provide a level of economic activity equal to or greater than before," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea that selling the Fullerton plant might provide a handsome windfall to 
Hughes only added fuel to workers' anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "'I think it's a total sham -- a shaft of the employees, people who have been 
here a quarter of a century," said Ted Fick, 53, sitting at the Sunny Hills 
Cafe nearby the Hughes facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Fick was one of about 50 Hughes workers who gathered Monday at the restaurant, 
a favorite lunchtime spot for Hughes employees. And the restaurant's "Daily 
Special" board had this message Monday: "Hughes: We're sorry. Soup and half 
sandwich special $4.99." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sunny Hills Cafe was one of many surrounding businesses whose lives were 
intertwined with that of Hughes, and the prospect of closure sent a shudder 
through the owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm scared," said L.J. Kang, owner of Son's Auto Care Centre in Fullerton. 
"It will definitely affect us. About 25% of our customers are from Hughes." 
</P>
<P>
 Anna Meadows, a cashier at Tummy Stuffer(, a sandwich shop in Fullerton that 
relied on Hughes workers for much of its business, said: "I can't imagine how 
it's going to be. . . . Everybody is from Hughes." Job Upheavals at Hughes 
</P>
<P>
 At its peak in the mid-1980s, Hughes Aircraft Co. had about 82,000 employees 
involved in aerospace. Today, the number has dwindled to about 51,000 workers. 
Here's a look at which plants remain open after the latest round of closings: 
</P>
<P>
 * El Segundo: Employs about 7,800 people to build lasers, night vision 
equipment and radar sets for fighter aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tucson: More than 7,400 workers at this facility build tactical anti-tank 
and anti-aircraft missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tijuana: Some 200 employees assemble electronic wiring harnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 * Santa Barbara: About 1,450 workers build infra-red detector arrays and space 
sensors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Long Beach: About 975 employees provide technical field support for various 
military hardware such as tactical missiles, communications systems and 
ground-based radar. 
</P>
<P>
 These plants have already closed or will soon: 
</P>
<P>
 * Fullerton: Has about 6,800 employees and will phase out most operations by 
the end of 1995, displacing about 6,000 people. Two small buildings will remain 
with between 700 and 1,000 employees to develop and build command and control 
systems and air traffic control systems. 
</P>
<P>
 * Canoga Park: Had about 1,900 workers. Announced in June, 1992 that the plant 
would shut down by Oct. 6, 1994. The facility was the headquarters and 
engineering center for missile systems group employees, which have since 
transferred to Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 * San Diego: Had 2,500 employees. Was an Unmanned Strike Systems division 
which made the Tomahawk and advanced cruise missile. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pomona: Had 2,400 workers. Air Defense Systems division which made the 
Standard missile and Phalanx gun system. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rancho Cucamonga: Had 1,500 workers. Air Defense Systems division which made 
the Stinger and the Rolling Airframe missile. 
</P>
<P>
 Note: The San Diego, Pomona and Rancho Cucamonga operations were acquired from 
General Dynamics in August, 1992, and were transferred to Tucson by the end of 
1993.

THE HUGHES CUTBACKS; CLOSURE OF O.C. PLANT WILL JOLT ECONOMY; LAYOFFS: IMPACT 
OF HUGHES MOVE MIGHT BE SOFTENED BY RETRAINING, OTHER HIGH-TECH GROWTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With the departure of its largest employer, the city of Fullerton and its 
businesses will be hit hard as the effects of Hughes Aircraft's plant-closing 
decision ripple through the Orange County economy over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hughes' action represents Orange County's largest-ever plant closure, 
economists say that it is softened somewhat by plans to send some workers to 
other Hughes sites nearby, the growth of other high-technology companies and 
increased retraining programs.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're disappointed, and I'm sure it's going to have a major impact on our 
businesses," said Carl Camp, president of the Fullerton Chamber of Commerce. 
"It's broader than just restaurants. It's the suppliers for everything you need 
to run a business, office supplies and machine tools, you name it." 
</P>
<P>
 But the area's economy will absorb the blow, Camp said. "We've been through 
this before, we survived it and we'll survive this one too." 
</P>
<P>
 Anil Puri, a Cal State Fullerton economics professor, said, "It's part of a 
long process. It isn't going to kill the county." 
</P>
<P>
 While sizable, the plant closure is only the most recent to hit Orange County 
since the end of the Cold War. It follows a nerve-racking series of layoffs 
that have slashed tens of thousand of jobs from payrolls in a county that once 
was awash in defense dollars and now finds itself hit hard by the nation's 
effort to cut military spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton has coped with Hughes layoffs and job transfers before -- the plant 
employed nearly 15,000 at its peak in 1986. In neighboring Anaheim, defense 
companies including Rockwell International Corp. and Northrop Corp. have 
shuffled workers and closed facilities numerous times over the years with more 
than 3,000 layoffs overall. Loral Corp. in Newport Beach recently trimmed 800 
people from its staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, California has lost more than a third of its aerospace-related 
jobs since 1986, including 6,000 from various Hughes plants in 1992 and 9,000 
from McDonnell Douglas Corp. facilities in 1992 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1997, Northrop is expected to complete the closure of its B-2 bomber plant 
in Pico Rivera, which employs 7,600. About 2,500 workers will be laid off, 
while the rest are set to be transferred. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists estimate that each job created through a defense contract supports 
another 2.5 jobs locally, according to Jack Kyser, chief economist at the Los 
Angeles County Economic Development office. That translates to more than 15,000 
people whose livelihoods will be shaken by Hughes' move from Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Locally, this is going to have significant impacts. All of the businesses in 
the area will feel it," Kyser said. 
</P>
<P>
 From a regional standpoint, however, the job losses and shifts of workers from 
Fullerton to Hughes plants in El Segundo or Long Beach might not be as 
significant, said Bruce DeVine, head economist with the Southern California 
Assn. of Governments in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Regionally, the economic impact should be a wash. You will have people 
commuting more and they'll be spending more money on transportation, but that 
will be canceled out by the loss of retail spending at restaurants and stores 
around Fullerton," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There certainly will be individual stories of great economic discomfort, but 
the entire process won't (result in) a major impact." 
</P>
<P>
 Under a severance plan announced Monday, laid-off Hughes workers will receive 
60% of their salary for up to 12 weeks after they are dismissed, depending on 
their length of service. They also will receive company-paid health coverage 
for 3 months and $1,000 to help pay for retraining. 
</P>
<P>
 It is uncertain how much of a difference retraining will make, at least until 
worldwide demand for commercial aircraft picks up and aerospace companies in 
Southern California begin hiring again, said Puri, director of the Institute 
for Economic and Environmental Studies at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer companies, the other large portion of Orange County's high-tech 
economy, will have a difficult time making use of aerospace workers' skills, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Manpower Employment Services Inc.'s Sue Foigleman,, area manager for Orange 
County and southern Los Angeles County, said the specialization and high pay of 
many defense workers may hinder their job searches. 
</P>
<P>
 "They higher up the ladder you are in defense, the harder it is to translate 
your job skills into a new environment. Aerospace defense work is a dinosaur. 
Most companies in Southern California are small, lean, mean and flexible and 
they want their employees to be that way too," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there are a lot of busy companies in Orange County, and for those Hughes 
people who lose jobs, a lot will depend on their willingness to come down in 
their expectations" for salary and benefits in a new job, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton city officials also worry about the impact of the plant closure. 
Hughes paid $675,000 in property taxes to Fullerton in 1993, and though the 
company will continue to pay roughly that amount, it will no longer generate 
the revenue it once did for city business. 
</P>
<P>
 Direct sales tax revenues from Hughes are minimal, city officials said, 
because most of the company's sales are to foreign governments, out-of-state 
companies or the Federal governments and thus are not taxed at all. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fullerton Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin estimates that the city will lose close 
to $100,000 in annual sales tax revenue from money now spent locally by Hughes 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 One possibly large benefit is that Hughes has owned its Fullerton site for 37 
years and is paying pre-Proposition 13 taxes on property valued far below the 
real market worth. The city and the county both could realize huge hikes in 
property tax revenue once the site is reassessed for a new buyer, said Edward 
Paul, Fullerton's revenue manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Kyser, the Los Angeles economist, said that development of the 350-acre Hughes 
property likely would create enough new spending -- and new jobs -- to offset 
the Hughes withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton plant was built in 1957 as Orange County began to attract large 
defense manufacturers looking for cheap and plentiful land near their bases in 
Los Angeles. For years, the county's economy was highly dependent on defense 
employment.  
</P>
<P>
 Only in the past decade have smaller commercial aerospace, computer and 
medical technology companies become as important to the county's economy as the 
plants of giants like Hughes, Rockwell International Corp. and McDonnell 
Douglas Corp. once were. 
</P>
<P>
 The large defense firms did well during the Vietnam War and during the defense 
buildup under presidents Carter and Reagan. In 1984, Orange County companies 
received $4.2 billion in defense contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 That figure had fallen to $2.4 billion in 1993, however, and the decrease is 
even greater when inflation is taken into account. Orange County lost 27,000 
defense-related jobs between 1987 and 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Puri and Robert Kleinhenz, another Cal State Fullerton economist, estimate 
that while 3.7% of Orange County's jobs were directly or indirectly related to 
defense contracts in 1992, the number has probably fallen to about 3% this year 
-- a decline from about 42,00 jobs in 1992 to 33,000 in 1994. O.C. Defense 
Cutbacks 
</P>
<P>
 Federal defense contracts in Orange County have declined to a level not much 
over half that of a decade ago, when $4.2 billion was spent. High-technology 
employment, most of which is defense-related, is also declining, having dropped 
30% from 1988 to 1993: 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Spending (in billions): 
</P>
<P>
 1993: $2.4 High-Technology Employment: 
</P>
<P>
 1993: 63,600

STRIKE DEADLINE PASSES AS LUCKY TALKS CONTINUE; LABOR: EMPLOYEES REPORT FOR 
WORK. GROCERY CHAIN AND TEAMSTERS NEGOTIATE JOB SECURITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 About 1,700 union warehouse employees and drivers for Lucky Stores reported 
for work Monday without a contract after all-night negotiations averted a 
strike at the supermarket chain's 235 Southern California stores but failed to 
produce an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Letting a 12:01 a.m. strike deadline pass, negotiators for the Teamsters and 
Lucky talked through the night and returned to the bargaining table later 
Monday to meet with a federal mediator over contentious issues of job security 
and flexible workweeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no extension of the contract. We're just going day to day," said Ed 
Mireles, head of Teamsters Local 952 in Orange, shortly before heading into a 5 
p.m. session. 
</P>
<P>
 Mireles said workers can call a special strike hot line after 1 a.m. today to 
find out if the two sides have struck a deal or if workers have gone on strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hopeful we're going to be able to work this out," said Judy Decker, a 
spokeswoman for Lucky. If there is a strike, she said, the company will 
continue its operations with non-union help under a contingency plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The union reached agreement on a new contract Sunday with the Albertson's 
grocery store chain and has previously reached agreement with the other major 
supermarkets, including Vons and Ralphs. All the contracts, Mireles said, 
contain job security clauses, which is the biggest stumbling block in the 
negotiations with Lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky has long had three Orange County warehouses -- in Buena Park, Fullerton 
and Irvine -- that supply its Southern California stores and 20 more in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lucky's parent company, American Stores Inc. in Salt Lake City, opened a 
warehouse in Fontana, which also serves the parent company's Sav-On Drugs 
subsidiary. The Fontana plant operates under a separate contract with a 
different union local and a wage schedule that pays warehouse workers $4.60 an 
hour less than the $16.60 an hour paid at the other warehouses. In addition, 
drivers are not included in that contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky transferred its liquor and wine unit from its Buena Park facility to the 
Fontana operation where the same products are handled for Sav-On. The Teamsters 
union figured it had lost 22 jobs because the drivers there weren't union 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 Though no Buena Park jobs were lost, the union fears the company will continue 
to shift work to other non-union employees and cause a loss of union jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Decker said the company needs the flexibility to move work among its Southern 
California warehouses to operate efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, work at the Fullerton and Irvine warehouses has not been affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky also wants to change the workweek schedule, which has required the 
company to schedule employees on five consecutive days a week and to let them 
have off at least one day of the weekend. Mireles said Lucky now wants a 
flexible schedule that would allow it to give workers days off during the week 
and not consecutively. 
</P>
<P>
 Mireles said that a possible strike has "100% support" from other unions, 
including the one covering butchers and grocery clerks. It was unclear Monday, 
however, how many members of other unions would honor Teamsters picket lines.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: UNOCAL CONSIDERING PROPOSAL TO SELL BREA-BASED RESEARCH 
UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unocal Corp., continuing the long process of refocusing its business, said 
Monday that it is negotiating to sell one of its research units to a private 
company that recently submitted an unsolicited offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The possible sale of its process technology and licensing business, which 
could come by the end of the year, could mean the loss of 113 jobs from 
Unocal's 600-member work force at the Brea research center. 
</P>
<P>
 The buyer, whose name Unocal would not release yet, would likely fold the 
Unocal unit into its existing facilities out of state, said Barry Lane, a 
Unocal spokesman. The sale would include about 200 U.S. patents and about 300 
licenses with third parties who use various process technologies developed by 
Unocal. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1988, Lane said, Unocal has been shifting its business focus to rely 
less on oil refining and more on overseas oil and gas exploration and 
production. With less reliance on its refinery system, the company has scaled 
down its research.

THE HUGHES CUTBACKS; HOUSING DEVELOPERS COVET CHOICE PROPERTY IN FULLERTON; 
REAL ESTATE: HUGHES HAS BEEN QUIETLY MARKETING LARGE PORTIONS OF ITS 350-ACRE 
FACILITY FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS. DEMOLITION COSTS COULD COMPLICATE THE SALE. 
</P>

<P>
 Home developers are eagerly considering hundreds of acres owned by Hughes 
Aircraft Co. in Fullerton, now that the defense electronics company plans to 
put nearly all of its Orange County property up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than two years, Hughes officials have quietly been shopping portions 
of its 350-acre campus location to such developers as Kaufman & Broad Home 
Corp. of Los Angeles, Fieldstone Co. of Newport Beach, Lewis Homes of Upland 
and others, real estate insiders said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every major developer has seen that site," said Clyde Stauff, a commercial 
broker in Anaheim with the Seeley Co. "Hughes and the city are going to have a 
big vacant eyesore. Nobody wants a 350-acre industrial park -- but it's a 
terrific site for homes." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the company said it would sell 286 acres of its rolling green 
campus, but keep 64 acres used for parking, a railroad easement and two office 
buildings the company plans to continue leasing, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes has more than two dozen buildings, some as small as 500 square feet, at 
the remote, high-security site. The defense giant holds leases on two of the 
buildings until the year 2011. Those two buildings hold 384,000 square feet of 
office space, enough for about 700 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Working closely with Fullerton city officials, Hughes is hammering out a plan 
to have a developer build at least 600 single-family homes on 140 acres. The 
company is also considering selling the remainder of the property directly to 
home builders, a move that could avoid flooding Fullerton's real estate market 
with about 2 million square feet of vacant industrial and office space, sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As far back as 1992, Hughes attempted to sell a 140-acre parcel of mostly 
vacant agricultural land located north of the Hughes compound and bordered by 
Pioneer Avenue and Sunny Hills High School. But the project was unveiled in the 
midst of the real estate downturn, with home prices falling and developers 
unable to borrow money. After several public meetings, the project was shelved. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the local real estate market picking up and the company phasing out 
its operations, the property is again up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Hughes does not intend to be a master-developer or to become a 
partner with a home builder, but wants to sell the land outright to a 
developer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hughes campus is next to the high school and surrounded on three sides by 
homes that range in price from $400,000 to $1 million. The property is bordered 
by Malvern Avenue on the south, Bastanchury Road on the east, Pioneer Avenue on 
the north and Gilbert Street on the west. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire site could support more than 2,000 homes and about 6,700 additional 
residents, predicted Al Gobar, a real estate economist who lives in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 The anticipated job losses in Fullerton would not necessarily mean a drop in 
sales of existing housing or damage surrounding property values, according to 
Gobar and other real estate experts. Only about 15% of the Hughes plant's 
workers live in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "One employer leaving Fullerton won't shut down the housing market," said Jeff 
Meyers, president of the Meyers Group, a Newport Beach real estate consulting 
firm. "And that location allows people to commute to Los Angeles. If priced 
right, those North County in-fill locations are some of the best-selling 
housing projects in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Gobar said that Fullerton land prices have increased about 20% in the past two 
years, with a finished lot of roughly 5,000-square-feet selling for about 
$125,000. That compares to a county average of about $115,000 per lot. If an 
acre holds six housing lots, he estimated a $100-million price tag to a 
developer for the 140 acres. And the finished homes, he said, would probably be 
priced about $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gobar suggested that it is difficult to establish a current market value 
for the entire site because existing buildings would have to be demolished, 
which could make the per-lot costs prohibitive for most builders. There is also 
the cost of any environmental cleanup of the site, which could be extensive and 
delay development. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done surveys, but so far we haven't found anything that requires 
significant remediation or cleanup," said Dan Reeder, company spokesman. "This 
is very clean for an industrial site. We don't have any problems here." 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Lunde, director of land acquisition for Kaufman & Broad, acknowledged 
that California's largest home builder is looking at the 140-acre parcel and 
would be interested in even more land, but he questioned whether it would be a 
cost-effective deal if his company had to tear down existing buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 And city officials caution that putting homes on the entire 286 acres might 
not be the best solution for the property. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hughes has been working with us and trying to come up with a plan for the 140 
acres," said Barry Eaton, chief planner for the city of Fullerton. "We'd like 
to take a look at the rest of the property and see if residential is the best 
thing for the city. Maybe it would be better to create an office park." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Russell, a Marina del Rey consultant, is marketing the site to various 
builders for Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just in the early stages," he said. "It's a big piece of property. You 
have to look at the surrounding uses -- what the community wants and what the 
city wants." 
</P>
<P>
 Several developers said interest in the Hughes property is likely to be very 
aggressive. "This thing is a winner," said one prominent home builder, who was 
actively considering the site and did not want to be identified. "It's a nice 
location and a pretty piece of property." 
</P>
<P>
 But Paul S. Williamson, a broker with Cushman & Wakefield in Orange, who 
represents a parcel of land near the Hughes facility, described the site as a 
potential "white elephant," if the company tries to find an industrial tenant. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson said building homes there makes more sense, especially compared 
with the difficulty of finding a new tenant. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't just dump that on the market. Someone who manufactures widgets is 
not going to move in there," he said. "The alternative is to let it sit vacant 
for five years, so why not make it a residential community?" Division of Hughes 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes Aircraft Co. will offer most of its 350-acre property for sale. The 
company will retain 64 acres and two buildings with 384,000 square feet of 
office space:

TEACHERS FUND BUYS RETAIL CENTER IN ANAHEIM HILLS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In one of the larger commercial real estate sales in Orange County this year, 
an Ohio teachers pension fund has purchased the Anaheim Hills Festival retail 
center for more than $49 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio bought the 494,404-square-foot 
open-air mall, which is 95% leased with such tenants as Mervyn's, Target, 
Edwards Theatres and Super Crown Books, brokers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not a regional mall or a power center. The reason they invested is the 
quality of the project and high occupancy," said Bill Dennis, a broker with CB 
Commercial in Newport Beach, which represented the seller, a private 
partnership of a major developer that he would not identify. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis said the sale signals increasing strength in the Orange County 
commercial real estate market and shows that "the investment community is 
realizing the sky is not falling and the bottom has been reached."

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: ROCKETDYNE REDUCES NUMBER OF JOBS CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly one year after Rocketdyne disclosed plans to cut as many as 990 jobs, 
company officials said more than half of those positions have been spared, at 
least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to employees in October, then-Rocketdyne President Bob Paster said 
plans were to trim employment by 10% to 15%, or as many as 990 jobs, within a 
year.But since then, the company has cut just 450 jobs, spokesman Paul Sewell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers were retained partly to help the aerospace company recover from damage 
to its sprawling Canoga Park complex caused by the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake, Sewell said. Other jobs have been spared because of an improved 
outlook for the space station program. Rocketdyne, a unit of Rockwell 
International based in Seal Beach, has been hired to supply the electrical 
power systems for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration project. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sewell did not rule out future cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not saying that the days of layoffs are over," Sewell said. "There 
probably will be layoffs, but we're not in a position to know when or where or 
how many." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Rocketdyne has cut about 35 jobs in various departments, 
Sewell said.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: STORAGE EQUITIES SIGNS $75-MILLION CREDIT DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Storage Equities Inc., a Glendale-based real estate investment trust, said it 
has secured $75 million in revolving credit through an agreement with a bank 
group led by Wells Fargo Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said the credit facilities will provide for working capital needs 
and acquisitions and will fund cash requirements of mergers and tender 
offers.During the first six months of 1994, Storage Equities acquired 24 
properties valued at between $50 million and $60 million, a company spokesman 
said. Most of the company's properties are storage facilities and 
mini-warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 The credit facility is divided into two components. The first is a 
$45-million, three-year loan that can be extended to five years at Storage 
Equities' option. The second component is arranged such that the company has 
access to a total of $30 million during the first three years of the agreement, 
$20 million during the fourth year and $10 million during the fifth and final 
year.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: MEDICAL PROPERTIES INC. TO CEASE OPERATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Medical Properties Inc., an Encino real estate investment trust, said last 
week its secured lender, Foothill Capital Corp., would complete foreclosure 
proceedings against all of Medical Properties' remaining assets within the 
week.The company said it will then cease business operations. Its board of 
directors will also soon resign. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical Properties owed $13 million to Foothill as of June 30. The company was 
unable to make required payments on the debt, which was due Dec. 31. In March, 
it reported it had defaulted. Medical Properties said its remaining assets are 
worth less than what it owes to Foothill.

HIGH-TECH ROBBERY; A BOOM IN BOGUS TAPES, CDS AND VIDEOS HAS POLICE REDOUBLING 
ANTI-PIRACY EFFORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mario Yagoda and the boys have this framed platinum record hanging proudly on 
the wall of their downtown office: Funny thing is, not one of the boys can 
carry a tune, pluck a string or blow even a discordant note. 
</P>
<P>
 And Yagoda? He plays a very bad trombone at best. 
</P>
<P>
 The silvery-colored record from the Recording Industry Assn. wasn't awarded 
for musical achievement but for efforts by this crew of Glendale police 
detectives to stem the illegal trade of pirated music cassettes and compact 
discs throughout the San Fernando Valley and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two years, Glendale's six detectives in the bunco-forgery unit 
have conducted several major stings -- mostly of local, mom-and-pop retailers 
selling pirated music, as well as numerous video store owners dealing in 
counterfeit rental tapes. Detectives have also shut down several production 
labs where counterfeit movies and cassettes are reproduced for black market 
distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale police are among several local agencies, including the Los Angeles 
Police Department, working with both the music and motion picture industries to 
help erase the spread of unlawfully produced cassettes, CDs and videotapes. As 
music and film technology advances, so too have the efforts to rip off 
legitimate artists and companies with often badly produced counterfeits that 
have flooded the legitimate video and music markets, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, pirated materials cost the recording industry an estimated $1.2 
billion worldwide, according to the Recording Industry Assn. The Motion Picture 
Assn. of America (MPAA), a trade group representing seven major film studios -- 
including Walt Disney Co., Warner Bros., Paramount, Sony and MCA-Universal -- 
estimates their combined worldwide losses at $2 billion annually to such film 
copyright rip-offs. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite recent publicity on the growing international black markets in 
countries such as China and Thailand, officials say they are equally concerned 
about such losses across the United States, including Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, the recording industry says it loses $600 million a year to music 
piracy, according to association statistics. Filmmakers say they lose $220 
million annually in domestic sales due to criminal copyright theft, according 
to the MPAA. 
</P>
<P>
 For bogus cassettes and CDs, the market usually consists of small, privately 
owned record stores and flea market outlets. Counterfeit movies usually reach 
the public through smaller rental stores, rather than through large chains, 
police and industry officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is monumental and growing," said David Dolson, supervisor of the 
MPAA's anti-piracy office in Encino. "Every year we seize more and more 
videotapes and make more and more cases. It's a little like street 
prostitution. The cops work and work and work to eradicate it. But what they 
succeed in doing is making prostitutes look over their shoulder before turning 
a trick. The film and record pirates are the same way." 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests have earned detectives a few nicknames: They're called "Flick 
Dicks." And "Disc Dicks." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's satisfying to put a stop to this kind of crime," said Yagoda, 31, a 
three-year veteran of bunco-forgery. "Because the real loser here is the 
consumer who pays real dollars for inferior quality movies and tapes. And when 
it comes right down to it, we're all consumers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the arrests continue to mount: 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities in 1992 convicted a Glendale man of illegally importing and 
distributing tens of thousands of bootleg copies of live rock recordings. The 
scam, officials said, involved illegally taping concerts and then producing 
compact disc versions of the music in a foreign country. After packaging, the 
bootlegs were then imported and sold domestically at a reduced price. 
</P>
<P>
 Police confiscated 10,000 illegal CDs at the man's residence and seized 
records showing he had sold another 20,000 to local music outlets. The CDs 
carried bogus names for legitimate groups. For example, Led Zeppelin was 
marketed as Pigs in Zen; the group The Replacements was billed as Substitute 
and Nirvana was simply Cobain. 
</P>
<P>
 In July of this year, Los Angeles police arrested three people in a raid of a 
Sun Valley home termed a major counterfeiting factory -- seizing 4,084 illegal 
videos, 31 videocassette recorders used to duplicate the films, and 2,000 blank 
videocassettes. At the time of the bust, all 31 VCRs were duplicating a single 
tape of the first-run film "What's Eating Gilbert Grape?" starring Johnny Depp. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had all these machines running at once, in the bedroom and the living 
room and the kitchen. Two hours later, after one running of the film, they had 
30 new pirated copies," Dolson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials are aiming their efforts not only at the production 
end of the piracy business but also at flea market vendors and small retailers 
who see quick profits in the sale of both music and movie bootlegs. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1993, Glendale police seized 46,000 illegal cassettes of Arabic music 
shipped from New York City and sold in a local international food store, Yagoda 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four months later, in the largest seizure of pirated compact discs in Southern 
California history, detectives confiscated 8,700 from the home of another 
Glendale man they said had peddled 20,000 illegal discs over the previous two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Lawhorn, an attorney who heads the Recording Industry Assn.'s 
anti-piracy office in Southern California, said illegally produced music 
cassettes account for the industry's biggest counterfeiting headache. 
</P>
<P>
 Most bogus cassettes are both produced and sold domestically, while compact 
discs are usually produced abroad and then sold here at home. Cassettes also 
reach a larger audience, he said. In the last year, however, the cassette 
piracy problem has taken a slight turn for the better, a point officials 
attribute to increased surveillance. In 1993, officials seized 2 million 
counterfeit cassettes, down from 2.5 million in 1992, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the counterfeit wars are far from won. 
</P>
<P>
 "Illegal reproductions cost legitimate retailers 35% to 40% of their 
business," Lawhorn said. "As music technology has moved from records to 
eight-tracks to cassettes to compact discs, the forgery artists have been there 
every step of the way." 
</P>
<P>
 For illegal videos, authorities say, the real money is to be made in rentals 
rather than sales -- mostly at small, independently owned stores that rent the 
counterfeit copies for as little as 99 cents per rental. "Last year, we raided 
10 to 20 stores in the Valley alone," Dolson said. "But these guys are getting 
smart to us. At one store in Reseda, we showed at night to collect the pirated 
videos as they were returned by customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "But nobody was coming into the store. One officer found the guy's wife 
standing outside with this big plastic bag. She was collecting the videos as 
they were returned so we wouldn't get to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Recidivism is rampant in the illegal video market despite stiff penalties. 
First-time offenders can receive up to five years in prison and a $250,000 
fine. "People pay their fines, do their days in jail and then go right ahead 
and do it again," Dolson said. "So there must be money in it." 
</P>
<P>
 The MPAA now has a toll-free hot line number to report suspected pirated 
tapes. On its 1-800-NOCOPYS line, the association pays rewards up to $15,000 
for tips that result in convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, counterfeiters hungrily look for new movies to copy. Especially 
children's films. And that makes legitimate movie makers mad. "Disney takes 
this kind of crime very seriously, as all the movie companies do," said Judy 
Denenholz, a vice president in charge of the anti-piracy office for Walt Disney 
Studios. 
</P>
<P>
 One counterfeiting trend is the use of camcorders to steal first-run movies 
right off the screen. "We've seen a lot of bogus 'Lion King' tapes," Denenholz 
said. "When we see a camcorder reproduction passed off as a Disney film, it's 
just devastating to us. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because we go through extreme quality controls, especially with animated 
films. And the quality of these counterfeit versions is just terrible. You can 
hear the audience laughter and can see people get up for popcorn. They're a 
joke."  
</P>
<P>
 Disney alone loses $100 million annually in film rip-offs worldwide. "We at 
Disney are seeing a substantial rise in all kinds of film piracy," Denenholz 
said. "People are calling us to report they're seeing more and more of this 
bogus stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 That's where Yagoda and the boys come in. They've got their feelers out there 
in the community -- in Glendale and elsewhere -- looking to bust their next 
greedy counterfeiter. 
</P>
<P>
 They've got their platinum record, now they're going for a second one. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a dirty little profitable game for these forgery artists," he said. "But 
sooner or later, we're gonna get them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're gonna put an end to their little song and dance."

IN THE ONCOMING LANE OF THE INFO HIGHWAY; TELEVISION: CABLE OPERATOR CVI IS 
PLANNING A FIBER-OPTIC UPGRADE TO DELIVER EXPANDED SERVICES, INCLUDING, 
POTENTIALLY, TELECOMMUNICATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER PENDLETON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley's largest cable television operator will invest $20 
million during the next four years in new fiber-optic technology that will give 
it the ability to greatly expand its services. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the direction of newly installed vice president and general manager Tom 
Schaeffer, Chatsworth-based CVI, West Valley, plans to start replacing its 
infrastructure of coaxial cable with the more powerful technology at the first 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The upgrade will initially allow CVI to expand the number of channels it 
offers its 95,000 subscribers from 60 to 77. But CVI's management is preparing 
for the time when it may dispense services on the so-called information 
highway, such as video on demand, home shopping, security services, home 
banking and -- if legislative hurdles eventually fall, as expected -- telephone 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 If all this talk of delivering new information and interactive services has a 
familiar ring, it should. CVI's fiber-optic upgrade comes after Pacific Bell 
announced plans last November to invest $16 billion over seven years to 
resurface its network in California. One of Pacific Bell's first goals, if it 
gets the go-ahead from the federal government, is to deliver cable TV services. 
And one of the first areas it will target is the west San Fernando Valley -- 
smack-dab in CVI's territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaeffer insists that CVI's upgrade was in the works long before Pac Bell 
made its plans public. CVI's 17-year-old system has run out of space to add 
channels, and customers are clamoring for new programming services, he said. 
This is happening as an array of new competitors -- including the phone company 
and satellite services such as DirecTV -- are eagerly eyeing cable's turf, 
threatening the monopolies most cable operators enjoy in their franchise areas. 
</P>
<P>
 So CVI is fighting back. The fiber-optic technology will give the cable system 
far greater capacity and the ability to run cable, data and voice signals over 
super-fast wires. In addition, Schaeffer is giving the system's marketing and 
customer-service practices the once-over. "We've got to become competitive 
against the phone company or any other outside company," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, all this preparation for cable's entry into the phone business is 
based on a future that might not come to pass. Most states, including 
California, prohibit cable companies from competing directly with local phone 
companies. But change is bearing down. The federal government is considering 
legislation that would preempt state regulations and allow cable companies to 
enter the telephone business and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 Pac Bell, too, is making plans to deliver video before it has the authority to 
do so. The Federal Communications Commission has yet to approve its request to 
provide these services throughout its phone service franchise. But the FCC has 
made it clear that it supports the principle of phone companies entering the 
video-delivery business. Pac Bell expects to receive approval soon. 
</P>
<P>
 National Cable Television Assn. spokesman Rich D'Amato said CVI's technology 
program is part of a national trend. "Cable operators around the country are 
upgrading their systems with fiber optics in anticipation of providing 
increased services" and eventually competing with phone companies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 CVI's neighbor, Ventura County Cablevision, for example, is in the third year 
of a six-year program installing fiber optics in the communities it serves. The 
upgrade has allowed that system to increase channel capacity. Eventually it 
will enable VCC to deliver advanced telecommunications services, said 
Christopher Lammers, president of Ventura County Cablevision's parent, Western 
Communications in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Before CVI starts installing its new network, it must get city approval. 
Within two weeks, Schaeffer will submit a description of CVI's rebuild plan to 
the Los Angeles Department of Telecommunications for review, and possible 
scrutiny by the City Council. If the city has no objections, it will take about 
60 to 90 days to receive the green light. 
</P>
<P>
 CVI will tackle the upgrades in 15 phases. Plans call for Chatsworth to be the 
first community to get rewired by April 1, followed by Reseda, Northridge, 
Canoga Park and Encino. That means Chatsworth subscribers in designated areas 
will be able to receive 17 additional cable channels beginning April 1. 
</P>
<P>
 CVI is also considering investing several million dollars in digital 
compression. This is a computer-based technology that allows a cable operator 
to cram more capacity into its pipeline, and it would enable CVI to provide 
hundreds of channels. Schaeffer said officials at CVI's parent company, 
privately held Cablevision Industries of Liberty, N.Y., are weighing whether 
the investment makes financial sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Cablevision Industries is the eighth-largest multi-system cable operator in 
the United States, with 1.32 million subscribers. CVI, West Valley, is the 
largest system it operates. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not clear how quickly CVI will recoup its investment in fiber-optic 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the pay-back will come from increased efficiency because fiber is 
cheaper to maintain than coaxial cable. Schaeffer said some cable rates may 
rise, but the new services will be offered to consumers in optional packages. 
Under the 1992 Cable Act, the FCC reduced basic cable rates by 17% on average, 
and set guidelines for how much operators can charge for basic services. The 
FCC and the cable industry are currently discussing how operators can recover 
costs such as those involved in fiber-optic upgrades, said the NCTA's D'Amato. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaeffer has been at CVI for five months, arriving about two months after the 
Northridge earthquake knocked the system out for two days and cost it 6,000 
customers as apartments and houses were destroyed. Schaeffer succeeded Tom 
Belcher, who left CVI last October to become vice president and general manager 
of PageNet in Los Angeles, the regional headquarters of the Plano, Tex.-based 
paging company. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaeffer, a 22-year cable industry veteran, recently spent two years in 
Britain as managing director of cable systems owned by a French conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaeffer would not disclose the West Valley system's financial results. Its 
primary revenue stream is the monthly fees customers pay for programming, 
supplemented by advertising sales and pay-per-view revenues. It also rents an 
on-site production facility to makers of TV commercials and series, such as 
"Behind Bars," a syndicated documentary show. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the new services, Schaeffer hopes to pump up subscribership by 
using market research to find out what customers want. CVI will also step up 
direct-mail solicitation and telemarketing. 
</P>
<P>
 Leo Brennan, vice president of Dimension Cable in San Juan Capistrano (a Times 
Mirror cable system) and president of the Southern California Cable TV Assn., 
said the Southern California region is a tough market for cable operators to 
attract new customers. Not only is there a large number of broadcast channels, 
but the temperate climate means outdoor activities compete for consumers' time 
and dollars, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to become more creative in our ability to service the customer than 
ever before," Schaeffer said. "It's a cliche to say that today, but we're not 
going to be in business if we don't."

QUARTERLY EARNINGS DROP AT DICK CLARK PRODUCTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dick Clark Productions Inc., a Burbank television production company, said its 
earnings in its fourth fiscal quarter that ended June 30 were $502,000, down 
44% from $900,000 in the fiscal fourth quarter of 1993. Revenues for the 
quarter were $12.4 million, down 19% from $15.4 million the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 For the year, earnings were $5.1 million, up 59% from $3.2 million in 1993. 
Revenues were $58.3 million, up 34% from $43.4 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The company attributed the lower fourth-quarter results to a decline in its 
television and corporate production business. Th dip was partly offset by gains 
in its restaurant sales stemming from the opening of two new American Bandstand 
Grill restaurants in the Midwest during the fourth quarter.

CALIFORNIA AMPLIFIER'S PROFIT CLIMBS SLIGHTLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California Amplifier, the Camarillo-based maker of equipment for beaming 
television signals, said its profit for the second quarter that ended Aug. 27 
was $550,000, up slightly from $544,000 for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenues for the quarter were $11.32 million, up 11% from $10.18 million last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 For the six months, California Amplifier's profit fell 12% to $956,000 from 
$1.08 million for the first six months a year prior. The slip was on a 20% gain 
in revenue to $22.51 million from $18.76 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company attributed these results to a $611,000 increase in research and 
development spending over the six months aimed at broadening its product line 
in wireless cable technology.

SINGLE-FAMILY HOME SALES REACH 6-YEAR HIGH DURING AUGUST; REAL ESTATE: DESPITE 
THE SURGE IN ACTIVITY, THE MEDIAN PRICE DROPS TO $175,000, DOWN 10% FROM A YEAR 
EARLIER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sales of previously owned single-family homes hit a six-year high for the 
month of August, but despite the heavy sales volume, median sales prices 
continued to sink. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month sales of single-family homes totaled 972, the highest level in 
August since 1988, and up 17% from 833 homes sold in August, 1993. But the 
median sales price last month was $175,000, down 10% from $195,400 a year 
earlier, and down 5% from $185,000 in July. The median price means that half 
the houses sold in August cost more than $175,000 and half cost less. 
</P>
<P>
 The average sale price of a home was $244,300 in August, up slightly from 
$241,600 a year earlier, and 9% higher than $223,400 in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, 1,099 single-family houses and condominiums changed hands in August, 
up 15% from a year earlier, when 959 closed escrows were reported. The latest 
sales figures were down 8% from July, when 1,194 properties were sold. But the 
San Fernando Valley Assn. of Realtors, which compiles the housing data, said 
sales activity typically winds down in August, as summer vacations end and 
schools reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 The quick pace of single-family home sales continued a summer-long trend in 
which sales volume has gone up while prices have gone down. Real estate prices 
have been depressed for about four years as Southern California's economy has 
struggled to recover from recession. Prices sank further when the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake damaged thousands of properties across the Valley, adding 
to the sizable number of foreclosed properties put up for sale, which also 
helps drive down prices. 
</P>
<P>
 But the deep discounts being offered on quake-damaged properties, along with 
the downward price pressure caused by persistent economic woes, have stimulated 
sales activity, especially among first-time buyers who in previous years could 
not afford Valley-area properties, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people used to think their only option was to move to more affordable 
outlying communities," said Alice McCain, president of the association. "Now

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: NEXTEL OFFERS TO BUY AMERICAN MOBILE SHARES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 American Mobile Systems Inc. in Woodland Hills said Nextel Communications 
Inc., a wireless communications company, has offered to purchase all the 
American Mobile shares it doesn't already own for about $73 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Nextel earlier agreed to acquire up to 65% of American Mobile equity for a 
combination of cash and properties in Florida.It currently owns about 9% of 
American Mobile's shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new proposal, Rutherford, N.J.-based Nextel would issue 3 million of 
its common shares, currently valued at more than $24 a share, in exchange for 
all of American Mobile's outstanding shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition of American Mobile is part of Nextel's plan to build a 
nationwide wireless communications system. Its plans were dealt a setback last 
month when MCI Communications Corp. canceled a $1.3-billion marketing deal that 
would have linked its long-distance service with Nextel.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: AMGEN SEEKS COURT ORDER PROTECTING RIGHT TO DRUG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amgen Inc., a Thousand Oaks biotechnology concern, is seeking a court order 
protecting its right to a drug that a rival company has claimed infringes on 
its own patent. 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen said it filed a complaint in U. S. District Court in Boston, asking the 
court to rule that its drug homogeneous erythropoietin (EPO) does not infringe 
on a patent held by Genetics Institute Inc. of Cambridge, Mass.In June, 
Genetics Institute filed a lawsuit in federal court in Delaware alleging that 
Amgen-produced EPO, sold in the United States by Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., 
infringes on a Genetics Institute patent. 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen maintains that any dispute over the patents for the genetically 
engineered EPO has been resolved by earlier litigation. Last year, Genetics 
Institute agreed to pay $14 million to Amgen to settle its longstanding patent 
dispute over EPO, and both companies were granted patents on artificially 
produced EPO. 
</P>
<P>
 EPO is a protein produced by the kidneys that regulates the production and 
release of red blood cells. It is given to kidney dialysis and cancer 
chemotherapy patients to boost their red blood cell production.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oasis Technology Inc., a Camarillo software firm, has carved out a niche 
producing systems that track and analyze customers' calls to public utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Oasis began helping Southern California Gas Co. computerize 
information about such calls. 
</P>
<P>
 That project is continuing, reports Oasis President George Baldonado, and 
additional contracts have recently been received from the state's two local 
telephone companies, Pacific Bell and GTE California. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect most of the calls to be complaints about billing or service," 
Baldonado said. "We'll create a system that will track customers' previous 
problems and how they were resolved. We'll also help analyze trends, showing 
regions or types of service where problems tend to arise." 
</P>
<P>
 Oasis, which expects sales of about $5 million this year, has been ranked by 
Hispanic Business magazine as one of the nation's leading Latino-owned 
companies.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW / JACK SEARLES: 3M PLANT IN CAMARILLO TO RETOOL FOR DATA 
STORAGE ADVANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Major upgrades in products and equipment will be made within the next year at 
3M Co.'s Camarillo plant, according to the facility's newly named manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The official, Charles (Chuck) Byrne, said 3M Camarillo will spearhead the 
worldwide introduction of a new generation of 3M's quarter-inch data 
cartridges. The new products are designed to offer important improvements in 
both storage capacity and operating speed of computers made by Hewlett-Packard, 
IBM and other longstanding 3M customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne said computers using the cartridges will be able to process hundreds of 
millions more bytes, or units, of information, than those using earlier 
cartridges. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market has great potential," he said. "For instance, only 15% of personal 
computers being used today are equipped with quarter-inch cartridges. There's a 
possibility of a dramatic increase in demand for the capacity and speed these 
cartridges can provide." 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne is returning to 3M Camarillo after a 14-month stint at the parent 
company's headquarters in St. Paul, Minn. He worked at the Camarillo plant as a 
business development manager from 1985 to June, 1993. He replaces former plant 
manager Kevin Rubey, who has been transferred to a 3M unit in White City, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 The Camarillo facility, which opened in 1964, is 3M's largest manufacturing 
plant in California. It is also the biggest unit in the parent company's Data 
Storage Tape Technology Division. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the Ventura County upgrade, 3M will make significant capital 
investments in the plant on Lewis Road, but it's too early to say whether new 
jobs will be added, Byrne said. 
</P>
<P>
 With a current payroll of more than 600, the plant is already one of 
Camarillo's largest employers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Computer technology is changing so rapidly that it's hard to say what will 
happen months from now," Byrne noted. "But if these products do as well as we 
expect, there's a good chance we'll need more people." 
</P>
<P>
 The hiring outlook is complicated by a fading market for computer tapes, which 
have been a major product of 3M Camarillo for years. Byrne said some workers 
may be retrained and moved from tape to cartridge production.

GREEN INC.; ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY IS CHAMPIONED, BUT SMALL AREA 
BUSINESSES SAY THEY'RE NOT CLEANING UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If business success were a popularity contest, environmental technology would 
be a leading index. The industry is trumpeted by the likes of Vice President Al 
Gore and Gov. Pete Wilson. Its growth seems inevitable, and few would quibble 
with its aims -- it's not every industry that can claim it's out to save the 
planet. 
</P>
<P>
 But for local companies, the reality doesn't quite match the hype. Turning 
environmental technology into a new, green engine for job growth in California 
is tougher than it looks. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, "we are hampered tremendously by being here," contends Inderjit 
Sabherwal, president of the toxic-waste cleanup firm Ensotech Inc. in Sun 
Valley. Sabherwal said that due mostly to frustration with state regulations 
governing soil and water cleanup, he is considering moving his 20-year-old 
business out of California. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley area has scores of environmental businesses -- those 
that prevent, detect, monitor and clean up pollution, or offer green 
alternatives to activities that harm the environment. Thanks to strict 
pollution laws and armies of unemployed engineers, Los Angeles is home to the 
nation's second-biggest concentration of environmental-technology companies in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 For many of those companies, however, the going is tough. Although a few giant 
concerns, such as Lockheed Corp. and Rockwell International's Rocketdyne unit, 
have gotten into the environmental-technology race, most of the companies in 
this evolving industry are small. Their expansion is limited by an array of 
obstacles. Lack of capital, increased competition, inconsistent enforcement of 
environmental laws and cumbersome state and local regulations governing cleanup 
are among the most common gripes. The recession has also taken a toll. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabherwal, for example, said his company was doing annual sales of $5 million 
and had a staff of 60 five years ago. Today, sales have diminished to $4 
million, and his staff has dropped to about 30. He blames the local recession 
in part. But he also said the state is slower than it used to be in pressing 
companies to clean up toxic waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Uziel of Enviropro Inc., a Chatsworth firm specializing in 
hazardous-waste cleanup with revenues of $3 million per year, says sales have 
fallen off in the last three years. He says that the Clinton presidency and 
state programs aimed at fostering the industry have been of little help to him. 
</P>
<P>
 And Owen W. Dykema, a 65-year-old former Rocketdyne engineer who has spent the 
last 15 years honing his invention for burning coal without producing acid 
rain, is just about out of money. He's still searching for that elusive 
investor he needs to bring his product to market. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But many of these companies are particularly rankled about regulatory 
problems. Common themes are the slow pace of state approvals for cleanup and 
excessive testing requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a company such as Ensotech can remove and treat, say, dirt tainted with 
lead, complicated negotiations over the extent of contamination, and the best 
way to deal with it, must be completed with the agency in charge -- usually the 
state Department of Toxic Substances Control or regional water quality boards. 
Local fire departments, water districts or county health departments often have 
to sign off on the project as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabherwal tells the story of his company's efforts to dispose of piles of dirt 
contaminated with oil, scraped from lands owned by a San Diego public agency. 
After more than a year of negotiations, Sabherwal was unable to settle on a 
plan for disposing of the dirt that was acceptable to his client and the 
Department of Toxic Substances Control. The client finally loaded the soil on a 
train bound for a landfill in Utah, where hazardous-waste statutes aren't as 
tough. 
</P>
<P>
 James M. Strock, secretary of environmental protection for the state, said 
enforcement of state regulations has been steady. But he acknowledged problems 
with cleanup approvals. "In California, we have the highest environmental 
standards in the world. But we also have one of the most convoluted permitting 
systems." 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason why many companies are having trouble is that, as their 
industry has matured, market growth has tapered off. At the same time, 
competition from a growing number of firms in the business has increased. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The competitive atmosphere has created an arms race of innovation, as 
companies struggle to meet client demands for cheaper and quicker ways to clean 
waste. But they run into roadblocks because they lack the capital needed to 
develop and market new products. 
</P>
<P>
 Uziel, for instance, has spent $350,000 developing a method of cleaning 
tainted soil by shooting microwaves through it. He thinks the device could 
drastically cut costs of cleaning up petroleum and other toxins. But he must 
find a partner to sell it because he can't afford the $3 million he says it 
would cost to market it himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabherwal has spent $1.5 million of his own money developing a method for 
treating soil with heat. "I haven't gotten one cent from a government agency, 
and the banks won't lend you anything." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason few investors will take a chance on environmental technology -- 
especially if it's related to soil and ground-water cleanup -- is that cleanup 
is considered risky because it's subject to government regulation, said Don 
Hichens, general partner with Liberty Environmental Partners. San 
Francisco-based Liberty is one of only about a half dozen venture capital firms 
in the country that specialize in funding environmental technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Air-pollution technology has been somewhat more successful in drawing 
investment because of California's long track record with strict air pollution 
standards, ample room for innovation and support from government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, investors prefer putting their money behind market-driven 
pollution products such as recycling and prevention technology, Hichens said. 
An example of preventive technology is Rocketdyne's new $1.3-million aqueous 
cleaning facility, scheduled to open at the Rockwell International division's 
Canoga Park site in November. That facility uses ultrasound waves, rather than 
polluting solvents, to remove grime from engine parts. Rocketdyne is also 
developing environmental products to market. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, innovation is more likely to come from small start-up firms than from 
big defense companies or engineering/remediation firms, said Hichens. And there 
are plenty such companies around. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Dykema, the former Rocketdyne engineer with an invention for burning coal 
without producing acid rain. Working from a tiny office in his West Hills home, 
he spends his days hunting for a foreign partner with the means to test and 
market his technology. 
</P>
<P>
 His idea, first developed at Rocketdyne, is to smolder the coal in a fuel-rich 
chamber prior to burning. The gas mix and temperature are manipulated so that 
polluting compounds such as sulfur form a solid. The remaining coal is 
relatively sulfur-free and can be burned without releasing the chemical into 
the air, he claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Dykema's plan requires a $30-million retrofit of 17-story coal-burning plants. 
Although a small-scale prototype of such a boiler has been built, the method 
has never been tested in a full-sized utility plant, Dykema said. With just 
$10,000 left in his company's bank account, Dykema says if he doesn't find a 
partner he'll give up the effort by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 What the environmental industry "really excels at is getting to the point 
where I am," he said. "Where we really fall down is getting from here to the 
market." 
</P>
<P>
 Same goes for Randy Cook, a San Fernando car shop owner and environmental 
entrepreneur. His idea is a spill-containment kit for diesel trucks that 
consists of a few folding booms, oil-absorbing mats and a pot of sticky clay 
for plugging leaks -- all neatly packed in a plastic bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook claims it's a cheap and practical solution to the common problem of 
roadside diesel fuel spills. For $49.95, he says, truckers could use his system 
to control fuel-tank leaks instead of waiting for the fire department to come. 
But few firms are buying it. Although Cook has managed to sell some kits to 
industrial shops, his dream of marketing them on a wide scale to trucking firms 
hasn't materialized, and he's frustrated that no one in government will act on 
his argument that spill-containment kits for truckers should be mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no help. I'm just going door to door, knocking on doors," Cook 
complained. "I don't understand it. This will save thousands of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the problems, there are signs environmental technology has turned a 
corner.  
</P>
<P>
 Banks and insurance companies are leaning on companies to keep their 
environmental record clean, further spurring the market for environmental 
technology. Nationally, a handful of innovative environmental companies sold 
stock to the public for the first time last year, a milestone that some believe 
will encourage more investment in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Strock, the California environmental secretary, said regulatory reform is one 
goal of the state's newly formed Environmental Technology Partnership, a task 
force of state and industry leaders charged with nurturing the state's 
$20-billion environmental technology industry. The task force is reviewing 
regulations statewide and is seeking to speed up the pace of permits. 
</P>
<P>
 The state also recently began an environmental technology certification 
program in the hope that "certified" technology will encounter fewer regulatory 
barriers and attract more investment to the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar effort is being carried out on the federal level. In July, the White 
House released a glossy 150-page report that outlined its strategy for 
regulatory changes, and educational and export programs to stimulate the market 
for environmental technology. And the federal Environmental Protection Agency 
has doled out $36 million in grants for environmental technology projects. 
</P>
<P>
 New state programs to encourage the industry are also getting under way: an 
environmental technology "incubator" funded by local government and donations 
is scheduled to open in Thousand Oaks this fall. About 20 start-up firms have 
already applied for office space and technical assistance it will offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Uziel, the CEO of Enviropro, says the growth of the industry can't come too 
soon to solve the nation's huge environmental problems. "Whatever you have 
heard and read," he warns, "it's worse out there."

SEPARATIST PARTY HEADED FOR VICTORY IN QUEBEC ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG TURNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Parti Quebecois, dedicated to winning Quebec's independence from Canada, 
was headed for victory in the provincial election Monday, promising to bring a 
year of political turmoil to the United States' northern neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on early returns, two television networks projected a parliamentary 
majority for the PQ, led by Jacques Parizeau, 64, who has promised to hold a 
referendum on Quebec independence within 10 months of taking office. Parizeau's 
party would oust from office the ruling Liberal Party, led by Premier Daniel 
Johnson, 49. 
</P>
<P>
 Parizeau has indicated that he would immediately set the wheels in motion for 
a referendum if he became premier. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the plans he announced during the campaign were adoption by Quebec's 
National Assembly of a "declaration of intent" to assume independence; 
appointment of a commission to draw up a constitution for the proposed new 
nation, and aggressive policies aimed at taking control of programs usually 
directed by the Canadian national government. 
</P>
<P>
 Separatists believe a Parti Quebecois victory would give them their best 
chance at independence, even though polls show that most Quebeckers now oppose 
separation from Canada. Their strategists contend they can reverse that trend 
with a vigorous Quebec government teamed with their separatist partners in the 
federal Parliament, the Bloc Quebecois, which holds 53 seats and is led by the 
charismatic Lucien Bouchard. 
</P>
<P>
 A surprise victory by the Liberals would have been a death blow to the 
separatist cause. Network projections showed the Liberals doing somewhat better 
than polls had indicated, but not well enough to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, a Quebecker who strongly supports 
national unity, stayed out of the provincial election but is expected to play a 
stronger role in the referendum campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Canada is the United States' largest trading partner and a key defense 
ally, the United States has a major stake in the outcome of the separatist 
struggle. The traditional U.S. position has been to say Canada is a valued 
neighbor but that the issue of national unity is one for Canadians to decide. 
So far, the Clinton Administration has continued to adhere to that line. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Quebec campaign commanded Canadian and international attention 
because of the separatism issue, within the province the dominant issues were 
the economy, which only recently has begun to emerge from a long recession, and 
voters' exhaustion with the Liberal government, polls show. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, sentiment for Quebec independence dropped steadily in the polls 
throughout the campaign, even as support for the PQ held steady or increased. 
The latest surveys showed Quebeckers opposed to secession from Canada by about 
60% to 40%, the same margin by which a 1980 sovereignty referendum was 
defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson became premier in January, succeeding Robert Bourassa, who retired 
because of poor health. He inherited a government that was seen by many voters 
as uncaring about Quebec's jobless and unwilling to do much to correct chronic, 
double-digit unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 50-day campaign, and in the months leading up to it, Johnson sought 
to reverse that by putting forward a new economic program and simultaneously 
warning that the Parti Quebecois' focus on sovereignty would distract a 
Parizeau government from job creation. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Parizeau argued that Quebec independence would be decided in the 
promised 1995 referendum and that this election was about good government. 
Parizeau also contended that independence is necessary for Quebec to achieve 
its economic potential, saying a PQ government would need all the tools of a 
sovereign nation to reach full employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Chretien's absence from the campaign was criticized in some quarters. But 
federal election officials often stay out of provincial politics and Chretien 
is sensitive to complaints in the rest of Canada that the federal government 
pays too much attention to Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Chretien is far more popular outside of Quebec than within the 
province, and an appearance on behalf of Johnson might have backfired. Chretien 
was justice minister in the early 1980s and was instrumental in helping Prime 
Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau enact a new Canadian constitution over the lone 
opposition of the Quebec government. Many Quebeckers never have forgiven 
Chretien. Background on Quebec 
</P>
<P>
 The Quebec provincial election has launched a new debate over independence 
from Canada. Here are some key facts about Quebec: 
</P>
<P>
 * Size: Canada's largest province in area at 594,440 square miles, roughly the 
size of Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 * Population: Second-largest in population after Ontario, with 6.9 million 
people, or about a quarter of Canada's total. About 82% speak French as their 
first language, 9% English and another 9% speak languages other than English or 
French. 
</P>
<P>
 * Economy: Comparable in size to Denmark. Quebec accounts for about 22.5% of 
Canada's total economy measured by gross domestic product. 
</P>
<P>

CHIEF REPORTEDLY PLANS TO CHANGE LAPD STRUCTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police Chief Willie L. Williams, under growing pressure from Mayor Richard 
Riordan to improve the Police Department's performance, is launching a 
reorganization of the LAPD's upper ranks that will demote his second in command 
and reshuffle several of the department's leading players. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources in city government say Riordan and his staff have become increasingly 
unhappy with Williams in recent months and have urged him to do more to take 
charge of the department. In particular, sources said, Riordan is anxious to 
see greater evidence of progress toward goals laid out in the city's Public 
Safety Plan, the blueprint for an LAPD expansion that was the centerpiece of 
Riordan's mayoral campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan and Williams met last week at the Pacific Dining Car, where they were 
accompanied by Riordan Chief of Staff William Ouchi, Deputy Mayor William 
Violante, Police Commission President Enrique Hernandez Jr. and LAPD Chief of 
Staff Ron Banks, the sources said. During that session, Williams said his 
efforts to make quicker progress in the Police Department were being hampered 
by his lack of confidence in his command staff, particularly Assistant Chief 
Bernard C. Parks, one of the most important and best known department 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said he planned to demote Parks and elevate Banks to become a new 
"super assistant chief" in charge of all LAPD operations and reporting directly 
to Williams. Under the current organization, Parks and a second assistant 
chief, Frank Piersol, report to Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 As Williams' chief of staff, Banks also has a direct line to the chief, but he 
is a deputy chief and ranks lower than the two assistants. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks, who has about 80% of the LAPD under his command, was representing Los 
Angeles at a sister-city conference in Berlin when Williams met with Riordan 
and only discovered upon returning that his position was in jeopardy. Parks was 
not at work Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Parks was unavailable for comment, sources close to the assistant 
chief say he already has consulted with attorney Skip Miller, a well-respected 
lawyer who handles many high-profile lawsuits and has represented the city in 
cases such as Rodney G. King's suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants in last week's meeting were reluctant to discuss Williams' 
proposal in detail but confirmed that a reorganization is in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chief Williams has indicated to me that he is uncomfortable with the 
chemistry between himself and some members of his top staff," said Hernandez. 
"He wants to gather a team around him that he has the best chemistry with. I 
have told him that I, as Police Commission president, am going to hold him 
accountable for achieving the goals and objectives we set. And I, by necessity, 
need to give him the latitude to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez stressed that last week's meeting was not called specifically to 
critique the Police Department or discuss individual staff members, but rather 
was part of an ongoing series of sessions involving city and Police Department 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez declined to discuss the individuals who might be affected by the 
proposed reorganization, but added: "Chief Williams has expressed an interest 
in having his chief of staff designated as an assistant chief coordinating the 
activities of the other two assistant chiefs." 
</P>
<P>
 Other officials said they had learned over the weekend that Williams was 
preparing to move Parks or at least dilute his authority. Some expressed 
concern about that idea, but others, including some who have expressed great 
respect for Parks, backed Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is moving to make the administration of his department have more of his 
personal stamp," said Councilwoman Laura Chick, a Public Safety Committee 
member. "I have the utmost high regard for Bernie Parks, but I also do for 
Chief Williams. My personal feelings for Bernie Parks aside, I am determined 
not to micro-manage the Police Department." 
</P>
<P>
 Parks, 51, is one of the department's most visible and highly respected 
officers. He has spent 29 years with the LAPD and came close to being appointed 
chief when the job went to Williams instead. Among his backers are a number of 
City Council members and retired Chief Ed Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 But Parks also has become a lightning rod for controversy. Since becoming 
director of the LAPD's Office of Operations, he has backed affirmative action 
efforts and has vigorously investigated allegations of sexual harassment in the 
ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, the Los Angeles Police Protective League filed a grievance 
against Parks, accusing him of disregarding the promotion process in voiding a 
slate of detectives vying for supervisors' jobs in the department's Narcotics 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams initially backed Parks in that dispute, but said at the time that he 
would have his staff investigate the complaint and then publicly announce the 
results in a few days. That was weeks ago; no public announcement has been 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 If Williams goes through with the plan that he has outlined to others, the 
reorganization would be the most significant set of personnel moves within the 
LAPD since Williams took office just over two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 It comes after months of growing frustration over the strength of his 
leadership. Some critics have begun to express doubts about Williams' ability 
to push through the remaining reforms urged by the Christopher Commission and 
to implement the Public Safety Plan developed by the department and the mayor's 
office. Some council members and aides to Riordan have privately complained 
about the lack of progress in those areas, which -- along with the depressed 
state of LAPD morale -- they blame on Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayoral advisers said Williams has not pushed hard enough to speed hiring of 
new officers or to redeploy officers from desk jobs to the streets. Neither the 
Public Safety Plan nor the redeployment of officers to the field is Parks' 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where is the community-based policing? Where is the commitment to get people 
out in the street?" asked one adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's staff believes that it has held up its end of the bargain by setting 
aside an extra $85 million in this year's budget for hiring more officers. They 
are concerned that the pace of hiring has lagged, however, endangering the goal 
of boosting the 7,600-officer force to 8,350 by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dick Riordan has given (Williams) $85 million, and this guy sits over there 
and, candidly, does nothing," the adviser said. "It is frightening." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, council members and the mayor's staff are reluctant to take 
on Williams, in part because he enjoys enormous public approval ratings -- 
exceeding those of Riordan himself. Williams is also perceived as having been 
highly successful at restoring public confidence in the LAPD, which was rocked 
by the Rodney King beating and the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been very good for the city as a symbol, to give confidence in the 
Police Department and to help heal the city," said one Riordan adviser. "He is 
a decent guy, and he has a charisma that is very important to this city." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams has acknowledged that some Police Department efforts are moving more 
slowly than he would like. In public, he has attributed that mainly to the long 
and bitter contract dispute over officers' attempts to secure a pay raise. That 
debate held down morale and made progress on other issues difficult to achieve, 
the chief has said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview with The Times, Williams denied that he was 
contemplating any moves that would alter the makeup of his senior staff and 
said rumors of him feuding with Parks were overblown. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who don't know me and some of my senior staff or even some of the 
mid-level staff make assumptions that because we don't always say the same 
thing all the time that someone's out to bring you down," Williams said. "Part 
of my job is to have a diversity of personnel (so) the chief can hear all 
issues, and then make what I feel are the right decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 But sources within the department say Williams and Parks have been at odds, at 
least off and on, since April or so. At that time, Ouchi intervened to ask 
whether Parks would consider taking a job outside the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks reportedly said he would not, and afterward he and Williams met to 
discuss their differences. Both said later that they believed the problems were 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' proposal for shaking up the department's upper management is 
complicated by still another development within the LAPD leadership. According 
to department sources, Deputy Chief Lawrence Fetters, one of the LAPD's senior 
leaders and a favorite of the Riordan camp because of his role in drafting the 
Public Safety Plan, has told colleagues that he intends to retire soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Fetters, according to police officials, plans to go to work in Atlanta, where 
he will help with the security planning for the 1996 Olympics. But his absence 
from the LAPD will deprive the organization of a respected leader at a time 
when its management appears to be in flux. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the personalities, there are structural questions about 
Williams' suggestion that one assistant chief assume responsibility for all 
LAPD operations. That same organizational structure was in place decades ago, 
but was abolished because it concentrated so much power in a single assistant 
chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick said she has some concerns about that aspect of the reorganization, 
which probably will require council approval because it would cost money. 
</P>

 STARTING OVER: Quake-damaged CalArts in Valencia began its 25th year Monday 
(B14) on a good note. Two former students won Emmys on Sunday.Michael Richards 
was best supporting actor in "Seinfeld," and Michael Pressman produces "Picket 
Fences," the best drama series. . . . But large trash dumpsters and the 
presence of construction workers showed that the campus hadn't finished 
rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 CD DETECTIVE: Mario Yagoda isn't best known as a big CD collector. But he sure 
has a lot of them. He's a Glendale detective assigned to stem the illegal trade 
of pirated music cassettes and compact discs in the Valley. . . . Detectives 
have conducted several major stings against local retailers. See Valley 
Business, Page 3. 
</P>
<P>
 TEEN WINNER: Win the U. S. Open girls' singles title? Northridge's Meilen Tu 
was just hoping she'd finish the tournament in one piece. She had groin and 
stomach injuries, and was in so much pain she couldn't hit a hard first serve. 
. . . But Tu, 16, won Sunday's title, and it may have changed her life. "It 
opens a lot of doors for me," she says. "It shows me I can play 
professionally." 
</P>
<P>
 ON THE AIR: Starting tonight, the Santa Clarita City Council will go on 
camera. The session will be taped and rebroadcast 5 p.m. Wednesday on a public 
access channel (B14). . . . It will be the first regular airing of the meetings 
in the city's history. Michael Arkush

TOM EWELL; FILM, STAGE ACTOR STARRED IN 'SEVEN YEAR ITCH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tom Ewell, an actor who gravitated to roles as a sardonic everyman and reached 
his peak of fame opposite Marilyn Monroe in the 1955 film "The Seven Year 
Itch," died Monday. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewell died at the Motion Picture and Television Country Home in Woodland Hills 
after a long period of ill health, his wife, Marjorie, said. 
</P>
<P>
 Never a handsome man, Ewell expressed surprise when he won the co-starring 
role with Miss Monroe, triumphing over more popular actors such as Gary Cooper 
and William Holden. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he created the role on Broadway and won a Tony award for it, Ewell 
said at the time that he was so certain that he would not be asked to reprise 
his character in the movie that he had rented a house for a vacation on 
Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Needless to say," he said, "I'm happy they did choose me." 
</P>
<P>
 Ewell played a bedazzled middle-aged man who has a fling with a dumb-blonde 
upstairs tenant while his wife is away for the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 He was standing next to Miss Monroe on location in Manhattan when 
photographers snapped the famous picture of her with a blast of air raising her 
white skirt. The widely distributed photograph reportedly angered her husband, 
Joe DiMaggio, so much that it became one of the events that contributed to 
their divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewell had even been somewhat surprised to land the role on Broadway in 1952, 
opposite Vanessa Brown as the temptress. He played the smitten leading man to 
critical acclaim for 730 performances. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his work on stage and screen, "The Tom Ewell Show," a 
television situation comedy series, ran for two seasons in the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewell was born Yewell Tompkins in Owensboro, Ky., where his family expected 
him to follow in their footsteps as lawyers or whiskey and tobacco dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Martine Tompkins, now 105, still lives in nearby Curdsville, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
 The young Ewell attended the University of Wisconsin, but quickly became more 
enamored of dramatics than law. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the Depression, he moved to New York and washed dishes, sold cigars 
and magazines and operated elevators while looking for work on the stage. His 
first break came in 1934, with a small part and a short run. As wry as many of 
his roles, Ewell often joked that he held a Broadway record -- 28 flops in 14 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Ewell was well established on the stage -- and described by one 
critic as "wonderfully hesitant, timid and desperate" -- before he tried 
Hollywood. He appeared briefly in the 1940 film "They Knew What They Wanted." 
But his screen breakthrough did not occur until after four years in the Navy 
during World War II, the Broadway hits "Apple of His Eye" in 1946 and "John 
Loves Mary" in 1947, and a Los Angeles Civic Light Opera revival of "Roberta" 
in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
 The breakthrough film was "Adam's Rib" in 1949, starring Katharine Hepburn and 
Spencer Tracy, in which Ewell played the husband of Judy Holliday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Ewell's other films were "A Life of Her Own" in 1950, "Up Front" in 
1951, "Lost in Alaska" in 1952, "The Lieutenant Wore Skirts" and "The Girl 
Can't Help It" in 1956, "State Fair" in 1962, "Suppose They Gave a War and 
Nobody Came?" in 1970, "They Only Kill Their Masters" in 1972 and "The Great 
Gatsby" in 1974.

AMY CLAMPITT; POET GAINED ACCLAIM LATE IN HER LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amy Clampitt, an acclaimed poet who didn't publish her first major collection 
until she was 63, has died of cancer at 74. 
</P>
<P>
 She died at her home Saturday, surrounded by her husband, Columbia University 
law professor Harold Korn, and several friends, said Mary Jo Salter, a friend 
and poetry editor at the New Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Clampitt's first major collection, "The Kingfisher," established her as an 
important poet, and numerous honors followed, including a Guggenheim Fellowship 
and membership in the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. 
</P>
<P>
 In awarding Ms. Clampitt a "genius grant" in 1992, the MacArthur Foundation 
cited "a quick eye for small, luminous details combined with a wide range of 
tone, style and form." 
</P>
<P>
 "She had many imitators and she'll have many more, because the most original 
writers are always the ones that the rest of us try to imitate," Salter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Clampitt began writing poetry seriously in the early 1970s, and by the end 
of the decade her poems were being published in the New Yorker and other 
magazines. Many of her early poems dealt with life in the lobstermen's town of 
Corea, Me., where she spent her summers for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the decade after "The Kingfisher's" publication in 1983, her reputation 
grew as she published at a feverish pace. "The Kingfisher" was followed by 
"What the Light Was Like," "Archaic Figure" and "Westward." Her final volume, 
"A Silence Opens," was published in February.

PHARM REPORT: BODY WATCH; PHARMACISTS DISPENSE ADVICE AS WELL AS DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For years, researchers have studied how long a physician spends with a patient 
during an average office visit. (Female doctors, 17 minutes; male doctors, 13, 
according to one recent study.) 
</P>
<P>
 Now it's the pharmacists' turn. 
</P>
<P>
 The Study: Pharmacists spend just over a minute -- 67 seconds -- counseling 
each patient about new prescriptions, according to a recent study by Ohio State 
University pharmacist Jon Schommer. 
</P>
<P>
 For refills, the average counseling time dips to 39 seconds, says Schommer, 
who timed the transactions of 265 patients at 12 Wisconsin pharmacies and 
presented his findings at the annual American Pharmaceutical Assn. meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 But if patients asked questions, the average conversation time's increased, 
says Schommer, who conducted the study with Joseph Wiederholt, an associate 
professor of pharmacy administration at the University of Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients who asked questions about new prescriptions talked with their 
pharmacists an average of 95 seconds. When they didn't ask questions, the 
average conversation took only 27 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 But these are just averages, says Schommer. The longest conversation among the 
transactions was 11 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Law: Under federal law, pharmacists must offer counseling on new 
prescriptions to Medicaid patients. In California, pharmacists are required to 
offer such counseling for all patients for all new or changed prescriptions, 
says Robert Marshall, chief executive officer of the California Pharmacists 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Perspective: In counseling patients, pharmacists don't want to overwhelm or 
frighten them, Schommer suspects. "Many pharmacists may be hesitant to talk 
about side effects because they don't want to unnecessarily alarm patients -- 
particularly when the chance of a particular side effect is small," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But once a patient shows an interest in side effects, the pharmacist will talk 
about them, Schommer says. Some consumers hesitate to ask questions, studies 
suggest, because they think the pharmacist is too busy or they fear looking 
stupid. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reaction: Some pharmacists say the time averages found by Schommer are 
misleading and that the time spent with each patient can differ greatly, 
depending on the medicine, the patient's medical history and a host of other 
factors. 
</P>
<P>
 "If patients are predominantly elderly, for example, that time can increase 
drastically," says Lee Souder, a pharmacist at Cal-Med Pharmacy West in La 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 The length of the counseling depends largely on the medicine and condition, 
says Stephen Schondelmeyer, professor and director of pharmaceutical economics 
at the PRIME Institute at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis. "If a 
patient were just diagnosed with diabetes, the pharmacist might spend 20 or 30 
minutes with that patient," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients picking up refills may already be well-versed and have no additional 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the pharamacist's counseling takes place in person at the pharmacy, 
Souder adds. "Often people don't ask questions until after they have read the 
printed literature," he says. "Then they come back or call back and ask 
questions." (Schommer acknowledges that his study didn't take this into 
account.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Rebuttal: Even though some consulting times might seem brief, Schommer 
points out that an experienced pharmacist can dispense a lot of information in 
a very brief time. In as little as six seconds, he says, many pharmacists can 
tell a patient the name of the drug, its purpose and how best to take it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Consensus: On one point everyone agrees: Patients should ask questions 
about medicine. "But a lot of times patients don't know what questions to ask," 
says Marshall of the California Pharmacists Assn. "So questions should always 
be preceded by the pharmacist providing consumers with as much information as 
he or she can." 
</P>
<P>
 Among questions that might not occur to patients, says Jeff Jellin, pharmacist 
and editor of the Pharmacist's Letter, a Stockton-based newsletter: 
</P>
<P>
 * What foods or other medicines does this drug interact with? 
</P>
<P>
 * Are there less expensive brands that are just as effective? 
</P>
<P>
 * Is there a longer-acting formula of this drug? 
</P>
<P>
 * Is there a once-a-day dose formula? 
</P>
<P>
 Asking will be easier, adds Schondelmeyer, if you find a pharmacist you like. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patients need to seek out pharmacies where the pharmacist is accessible and 
willing to answer questions and raise issues about which patients should be 
aware."

'EVERYTHING FOR EVERYBODY': VARIETY SPICES SINGLES' LIVES; POLL: 7 IN 10 
CONSIDER THE COUNTY AN EXCELLENT OR GOOD PLACE FOR THEM. ACTIVITIES SEEM TO BE 
THE MAJOR ATTRACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Is Orange County a good place to be single? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I'm here," said Kim Stahler, 25, of Corona del Mar, who grew up in 
Northern California, went to school in Santa Barbara but moved south to get 
serious. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I got my MBA here. That's why I chose UCI. I could live on the 
beach, meet some cool people, get some education, have some fun. I mean, 
Northern California is boring. It's quiet. Even Santa Barbara is quiet. When 
people graduate, they leave town." 
</P>
<P>
 But Orange County, "it's a really fun place to be. Because you have a lot of 
options for things to do." 
</P>
<P>
 On this particular Saturday night, Stahler was doing The Warehouse, a popular 
singles nightclub in Newport Beach, where it took hardly any time at all to 
meet Brad Allen, 25, of San Clemente, a student and sometimes nightclub 
doorman. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen said he couldn't agree more. "Out here there's more than enough stuff to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll queried Orange County's singles and discovered that, like 
Stahler and Allen, seven in 10 consider the county an excellent or good place 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
 It is "yet another sign that Orange County has been transformed from a 
family-oriented suburban 'bedroom' community to a bustling and diverse 
metropolis," said Mark Baldassare, a UCI professor of social ecology who 
conducted the random poll of 500 unmarried adults for The Times in late June. 
</P>
<P>
 There is more to it than just night life. Single as well as married people 
value such amenities as pleasant climate, relatively low congestion, an ocean 
shoreline and diverse dining and shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 But the array of activities seems to be a major attraction, said Bob Houle, a 
San Juan Capistrano psychologist who publishes a singles' newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many single people here do an incredible array of things in just one week," 
he said. "Friday night they may go to a group for singles -- some of the 
commercial groups around or athletic singles -- and on a Saturday afternoon go 
to Parents Without Partners in hopes of maybe meeting someone. 
</P>
<P>
 "They might go to the beach or some outdoor activity. Saturday night, again 
there's single dances, lots of clubs, particularly in Newport Beach. And 
there's the reggae boat parties and the blues boat parties. If you look in the 
paper any given week there's clubs meeting, from library book readings to 
sailing. The word mecca comes to mind -- everything for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach psychologist Paul B. Whittemore says an even stronger lure is 
probably the combination of two factors "that feed each other." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of wealth and power here in the male population -- lots of 
successful entrepreneurs -- and this attracts a lot of beautiful women. And 
from the male perspective, there is a disproportionately high percentage of 
attractive women compared to other areas. Those two things help to generate 
each other." 
</P>
<P>
 This is recognized outside the area, Whittemore said. "When I was a therapist 
in West Covina, I was surprised at how many singles were traveling to Newport 
Beach hoping to meet someone." 
</P>
<P>
 Singles queried by The Times Orange County Poll named Newport Beach most often 
as the best place for singles to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "Newport Beach is the center, there's no doubt about that," said Jennifer 
Marshall, who lives in Newport Beach and teaches seminars on successful dating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I moved out here when I decided to get married. I ended a 12-year 
relationship and moved here from the Bay Area. There are so many men down here. 
You meet five, six in one day." 
</P>
<P>
 There is such a selection, she said, that you must screen the people you meet. 
"Effective dating" requires that "you get clear on what you want." She has 
students make a list of attributes they desire in a spouse, then pick the two 
that are "non-negotiable." 
</P>
<P>
 "Find out about them right away. Mine are they can't do drugs and they must 
like children. I want kids. If they've had vasectomies, I don't date them. This 
is the key. If you just want a good time, that's different." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who date or plan to said merely going to singles hot spots to meet 
potential dates is not their preference. The most commonly mentioned "best way" 
was introduction through friends. Clubs, bars and coffeehouses were a distant 
second. "I think a lot of people go to places like that out of curiosity, but 
to meet someone serious, it's a different story," Whittemore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dating services, classified ads and family were at the bottom of the list. 
</P>
<P>
 Some singles hinted that the rules of dating have changed somewhat. A majority 
of those polled said most singles feel awkward about how to act in 
relationships because of changes in men's and women's roles. About four in 10 
said they shared expenses on the typical date, but more than half the men said 
they were still picking up the entire tab. Only 3% of women reported doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether this was discouraging dating was unclear. The poll showed that 35% of 
single men and 28% of single women in Orange County were not dating but wanted 
to. Some of these people "are stuck because they don't recognize the diversity 
around them," Houle said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad to see people not risking anymore, fearing rejection. They're like a 
duck that kept going into the horse barn to find a mate. I went to disco bars. 
I hate disco, and I kept wondering why I wasn't attracting anyone. Single 
people do this all the time and feel defeated because they're rejected all the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you count the list of singles activities -- or just activities in general, 
like book signings -- there's hundreds in the paper each week. Hundreds! 
There's no excuse for people not meeting people." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not so easy if you're gay, says John Barrie, 37, a business consultant in 
Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're gay, you're limited in where you can go to meet people in general. 
It isn't like you can go anywhere, like if you're straight. If you're gay, you 
have to be a lot more careful, so you tend to go into areas where you know 
you're going to be safe and not offend anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that while West Hollywood may be more open to gays, it is an isolated 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you have a little more diversity of where you can go in Orange 
County. There are places in Laguna Beach, Costa Mesa, Garden Grove, Buena Park 
-- entertainment establishments. There's the gay and lesbian center in Garden 
Grove. Basically, no matter where you live, you can go out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest part is trying to meet people other than in the bars," he said. 
"Most of time there, you meet people who are drunk or on their way. You can 
meet people at the gym -- watch who they hang out with so you can see what side 
of the road they're on, so to speak." 
</P>
<P>
 But trying to meet people at work still is risky, Barrie says. "You can't have 
office romances, unless you're in an industry that's basically gay -- anything 
in design, fashion, a lot of hotels and restaurants -- or a real large company, 
maybe over a thousand employees. They are basically tolerant because they don't 
want trouble for something as trivial as that." 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, Barrie says, Orange County is as good a place as any for gays to 
be. "It's a peaceful place to live. I've never had any problems with people. I 
don't run around saying, 'I'm gay, I'm gay, I'm gay,' I don't do anything 
outrageous, but I don't hide it. In every area there are hostile people, but 
most people don't give a damn." 
</P>
<P>
 SUNDAY: Though most are satisfied with single life, they'd trade it for that 
ideal mate. 
</P>
<P>
 MONDAY: From picking up the tab to interracial relationships, the dating rules 
are changing. 
</P>
<P>
 TODAY: Abundant activities help O.C. attract young, middle-aged and senior 
singles. How This Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Orange County Poll was conducted by Mark Baldassare and Associates. 
The telephone survey of 500 unmarried Orange County adult residents was 
conducted from June 22 to 26 on weekday nights and weekend days using a 
computer-generated random sample of telephone numbers. The margin of error for 
the total sample is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points at the 95% confidence 
level. That means it is 95% certain that the results are within 4.5 percentage 
points of what they would be if every unmarried adult resident in the county 
were interviewed. For subgroups, the margin of error would be higher. All 
respondents were guaranteed anonymity; however, some of those polled agreed to 
be re-interviewed for the stories. TIMES ORANGE COUNTY POLL: O.C.: A Good Place

 Orange County may have a reputation as a "family-friendly" suburban enclave,

CHIEF DEMOTES TOP AIDE IN LAPD SHAKE-UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police Chief Willie L. Williams -- under growing pressure from the Police 
Commission and Mayor Richard Riordan to improve the Police Department's 
performance -- announced Monday that he is reorganizing the LAPD's upper ranks, 
demoting his second in command and reshuffling several of the department's 
leading players. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the course of the summer, I did a self-analysis of myself, my 
administration, where it is and where we need to go," Williams said in an 
interview before announcing the changes. "I came to the conclusion that I 
needed to restructure my senior staff." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said he was pleased by some of the department's progress since he 
took over in 1992 but added that "we were not functioning as a team." He 
described the shake-up, including the demotion of Assistant Chief Bernard C. 
Parks, as effective immediately, but some aspects will require approval from 
the City Council, where Parks has many allies. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Williams said the changes were his idea, others said the chief has 
come under increasing pressure in recent months to demonstrate that he can 
effectively lead the LAPD. Critics, including Riordan advisers, say Williams 
has moved too slowly to make changes recommended by the Christopher Commission 
and has failed to aggressively implement the city's Public Safety Plan, the 
blueprint for an LAPD expansion that was the centerpiece of Riordan's mayoral 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources in city government say Riordan and his staff have repeatedly urged 
Williams to do more to take charge of the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last week, in fact, Riordan and Williams met at the Pacific Dining Car 
restaurant, where they were accompanied by Riordan Chief of Staff William 
Ouchi, Deputy Mayor William Violante, Police Commission President Enrique 
Hernandez Jr. and LAPD Chief of Staff Ronald Banks, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 During that session, Williams said his efforts to make quicker progress in the 
Police Department were being hampered by his lack of confidence in his command 
staff, particularly Parks, one of the most important and best known officials 
within the department. 
</P>
<P>
 At that meeting, Williams proposed correcting the department's problems by 
shaking up its top personnel. On Monday, he announced several moves and said 
more would be forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Most startlingly, he demoted Parks and replaced him with Deputy Chief Bayan 
Lewis, a veteran official who has played important roles in the Police 
Department's response to the city's many emergencies in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks was promoted to become first assistant chief, a new position that places 
him in charge of all LAPD operations and has him reporting directly to 
Williams. Parks will drop in rank to deputy chief. His new duties have not yet 
been decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the old organization, Parks and a second assistant chief, Frank Piersol, 
reported to Williams. As chief of staff, Banks was a central player in many 
department decisions and had a direct line to Williams, but he was a deputy 
chief, ranking lower than either of the two assistants. Piersol will remain an 
assistant chief, but will report to Banks instead of Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to those changes, Williams announced that he is promoting Cmdr. 
David J. Gascon, the department's chief spokesman, to the rank of deputy chief. 
Gascon, whose handling of the department's public relations is widely credited 
with helping spark the LAPD's resurgent popularity, will take over for retiring 
Deputy Chief Lawrence Fetters. 
</P>
<P>
 Gascon will inherit responsibility for the Public Safety Plan, Riordan's top 
priority and one that Williams said was "the No. 1 issue in city government." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the demotion of Parks that captured most attention Monday and that 
most rocked police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks, who had roughly 80% of the LAPD under his command, was representing Los 
Angeles at a sister-city conference in Berlin when Williams met with Riordan. 
Parks only discovered upon returning a few days ago that his position was in 
jeopardy. He was not at work Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Parks was unavailable for comment, he already has consulted with 
attorney Skip Miller, a well-respected lawyer who handles many high-profile 
lawsuits and has represented the city in cases such as Rodney G. King's suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to him briefly over the weekend," Miller said. "He is out with his 
family for a couple of days. This was done in his absence, without any 
discussion with him. . . . He had no notice, no forewarning." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams declined to comment on whether he had spoken with Parks but said 
Parks was "well aware of my feelings and my views." 
</P>
<P>
 Commission President Hernandez, who has spoken highly of Parks on many 
occasions, said he would respect Williams' desire to create his own team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chief Williams has indicated to me that he is uncomfortable with the 
chemistry between himself and some members of his top staff," Hernandez said. 
"He wants to gather a team around him that he has the best chemistry with. I 
have told him that I, as Police Commission president, am going to hold him 
accountable for achieving the goals and objectives we set. And I, by necessity, 
need to give him the latitude to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez stressed that last week's meeting with Riordan was not called 
specifically to critique the Police Department or to discuss individual staff 
members, but rather was part of an ongoing series of sessions between city and 
Police Department leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Other officials said they had learned over the weekend that Williams was 
preparing to move Parks or at least to dilute his authority. Some expressed 
concern about that idea, but others, including some who have expressed great 
respect for Parks, backed Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is moving to make the administration of his department have more of his 
personal stamp," said Councilwoman Laura Chick, a member of the Public Safety 
Committee. "I have the utmost high regard for Bernie Parks, but I also do for 
Chief Williams. My personal feelings for Bernie Parks aside, I am determined 
not to micro-manage the Police Department." 
</P>
<P>
 Parks, 51, is one of the department's most visible and highly respected 
officers. He has spent 29 years with the LAPD and came close to being appointed 
chief when the job went to Williams instead. Among his backers are a number of 
City Council members and retired Chief Ed Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 But Parks also has become a lightning rod for controversy. Since becoming 
director of the LAPD's Office of Operations, he has backed affirmative action 
efforts and has vigorously investigated allegations of sexual harassment in the 
ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, the Los Angeles Police Protective League filed a grievance 
against Parks, accusing him of disregarding the promotions process in voiding a 
slate of detectives vying for supervisors' jobs in the department's Narcotics 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams initially backed Parks in that dispute, but said at the time that he 
would have his staff investigate the complaint and then publicly announce the 
results in a few days. That was weeks ago; no public announcement has been 
made, although Williams said Monday that he and Parks "agree 110%" on that 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 But sources within the department say Williams and Parks have been at odds, at 
least off and on, since April or so. At that time, Ouchi intervened to ask 
whether Parks would consider taking a job outside the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks reportedly said he would not, and afterward he and Williams met to 
discuss their differences. Both said later that they believed the problems were 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 The reorganization unveiled by the chief Monday is the most significant set of 
personnel moves within the LAPD since Williams took office just over two years 
ago. It comes after months of building frustration over the strength of his 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayoral advisers said Williams has not pushed hard enough to speed hiring of 
new officers or to redeploy officers from desk jobs to the streets. Ironically, 
neither of those issues is Parks' responsibility, and some Riordan aides 
actually are more impressed with Parks than with Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where is the community-based policing?" one Riordan adviser asked. "Where is 
the commitment to get people out in the street?" 
</P>
<P>
 Freeing up more officers to fight crime and expanding the Police Department 
were the central promises of Riordan's mayoral campaign, and City Hall sources 
said Riordan aides are most deeply concerned about Williams' ability to deliver 
on the expansion plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's staff feels it has held up its end of the bargain by setting aside 
an extra $85 million in this year's budget for hiring more officers. They are 
concerned that despite that investment, however, the pace of new hires has 
fallen below plans, endangering the goal of boosting the 7,700-officer force to 
8,350 by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dick Riordan has given (Williams) $85 million, and this guy sits over there 
and, candidly, does nothing," the adviser said. "It is frightening." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, council members and the mayor's staff are reluctant 
to take on Williams, in part because he enjoys enormous public approval ratings 
-- exceeding those of Riordan, in fact. What's more, Williams is perceived as 
having been enormously successful at restoring public confidence in the LAPD, 
which was rocked by the Rodney G. King beating and the handling of the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been very good for the city as a symbol, to give confidence in the 
Police Department and to help heal the city," said one Riordan adviser. "He is 
a decent guy and he has a charisma that is very important to this city." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams has acknowledged that some Police Department efforts are moving more 
slowly than he would like. In public, he has attributed that mainly to the long 
and bitter contract dispute over officers' attempts to secure a pay raise. That 
debate held down morale and made progress on other issues difficult to achieve, 
the chief has said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview with The Times, Williams conceded that the LAPD was 
struggling with some issues but denied that he was contemplating any moves that 
would alter the makeup of his senior staff. He also said rumors of him feuding 
with Parks were overblown. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who don't know me and some of my senior staff or even some of the 
mid-level staff make assumptions that because we don't always say the same 
thing all the time that someone's out to bring you down," Williams said. "Part 
of my job is to have a diversity of personnel (so) the chief can hear all 
issues, and then make what I feel are the right decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' decision to shake up the department's upper management is 
complicated by still another development within the LAPD leadership. Fetters, 
one of the department's senior leaders and a favorite of the Riordan camp 
because of his role in drafting the Public Safety Plan, has told colleagues he 
intends to retire in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Fetters plans to go to work in Atlanta, where he will help with the security 
planning for the 1996 Olympics. His absence from the LAPD will deprive the 
organization of a respected leader at a time when its management is in flux. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the personalities, there are structural questions about 
Williams' suggestion that one assistant chief assume responsibility for all 
LAPD operations. That same organizational structure was in place decades ago, 
but was abolished because it concentrated so much power in a single assistant 
chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Chick said she has some concerns about that aspect of the 
reorganization, which probably will require council approval because it would 
cost money. 
</P>
<P>
 "My knee-jerk reaction is to ask whether this would put another layer between 
the chief and his staff," she said. "Also, I am concerned about the possibility 
of concentrating so much authority in a person below the chief level."

THE TIMES POLL; WILSON LEADS BROWN AMONG LIKELY VOTERS; HER ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE

<P>
 Despite widespread concern about the economy and continuing disaffection with 
incumbent Gov. Pete Wilson, California voters would reelect Wilson over 
Democratic challenger Kathleen Brown if the November election were held today, 
the Los Angeles Times Poll has found. 
</P>
<P>
 Among voters likely to cast ballots, Wilson holds a 9-point lead, 50% to 41%. 
Among the larger group of registered voters, Wilson's lead is a statistically 
insignificant 2 points, 46% to 44%. Still, it is a distinct reversal from the 
last Times poll taken in May, when Brown held a 10-point advantage over Wilson 
among registered voters, and other surveys dating back 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey found that Wilson has not markedly improved his standing among 
Californians, but rather that Brown has failed to sustain a groundswell of 
support for her own candidacy since her June nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 That was most apparent when voters were asked their views about the economy -- 
commonly a bellwether for an incumbent's chances of reelection. While 34% 
believe the state is in a serious recession and another 51% feel the state's 
economy is mildly to moderately recessionary, Wilson is still regarded as the 
candidate best able to handle the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The finding is sobering for Brown, who has sought to mine voter pessimism 
about the economy as she pushes toward the Nov. 8 election. The state treasurer 
has repeatedly characterized Wilson as not up to the job of managing the 
state's fiscal troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have made this their issue and they're losing it," said poll director 
John Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also got better grades from voters on two of the three other issues of 
major importance, crime and immigration, while Brown was credited with being 
better at only one, education. 
</P>
<P>
 In another blow to Democrats, President Clinton's approval rating hit its 
lowest point since his election. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Brennan cautioned that the high levels of voter discontent mean that no 
candidate or party can afford to be complacent. In a strong signal of dismay 
over the state of the state, fully 63% of voters said they believe California 
is headed in the wrong direction. Only 26% said it is on the right track. 
</P>
<P>
 "The landscape is still there for a Democratic victory," Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the difficulties facing Democrats in general and their candidates in 
particular were brought into sharp relief by the Times poll, which was 
conducted Sept. 8-11. It showed that the strong tail wind that pushed Democrats 
to broad victories in 1992 has shifted drastically. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, 1992, for example, Democrats were seen by 46% of registered voters 
as the party best able to handle problems, while 32% sided with Republicans. 
Now, Republicans are narrowly seen as the best problem-solvers. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's job rating in this all-important electoral state has also plummeted, 
hitting a low since his election of 44% positive, 49% negative. Since the last 
poll in May, the president's approval rating has dropped 12 points and the 
percentage of voters who disapprove of him has risen 14 points. As recently as 
March, Clinton was given a positive rating by 59% of California voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll surveyed 1,165 registered voters, including 721 considered 
likely to cast ballots in November. It was the first time the Times Poll 
isolated likely voters for this race. The margin of sampling error for 
registered voters is 3 points in either direction; for likely voters it is 4 
points in either direction. Margins of error for smaller subgroups of voters 
may be larger. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's slim 2-point lead over Brown among registered voters marked the first 
time in 18 months of polling that the governor has bested his Democratic 
challenger. In March, 1993, Brown held a walloping 22-point lead over Wilson, 
53% to 31%. One year ago her lead was 8 points, and in polling that took place 
in March and May she was 10 points ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's relative weaknesses were apparent when the poll broke down her support 
among influential voter groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrat has lost ground in the last four months among whites, men, 
independents and the elderly, the poll found. Loyalty to her among Democratic 
men, a key constituency, was clearly lacking, with 31% of them supporting 
Wilson. In contrast, only 15% of Republican women, another highly watched 
group, had switched sides to support Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her defections are greater than his among these battleground groups," Brennan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown continues to lead among African Americans and Latinos, but a third of 
the latter group sides with Wilson. That is the same level of support he 
enjoyed from Latinos in 1990, indicating that his high-profile attacks on 
illegal immigration have thus far not cost him politically in this group. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever bad news the poll delivered to Brown, it was clear that California 
voters are still not enamored of their incumbent chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 41% of adults and 44% of registered voters approve of the way Wilson is 
handling his gubernatorial duties, and about half of both groups disapprove. 
That was only a slight rise from May, when 38% of Californians and 39% of 
registered voters approved Wilson's job handling. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to another question, 47% of voters said they had a favorable 
impression of Wilson and the same percentage had an unfavorable impression. The 
numbers showed a slight improvement from May, when 43% viewed him favor ably 
and 52% negatively. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Brown was viewed favorably by 46% and negatively by 33%. Her 
current numbers reflect a 2-point decline in favorability and a 6-point 
increase in unfavorable impressions since May. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a better comparison than Wilson's, Brown's numbers appeared somewhat 
soft. Among those who view both Brown and Wilson favorably, Wilson led by 55% 
to 29%. He also won among those who disliked both of them and among those who 
said they did not know enough about Brown to rate her. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's lead over Brown on different issues of importance to California 
voters was striking. Asked who could best handle crime, half said Wilson and 
only 24% said Brown. Asked who could best handle problems stemming from illegal 
immigration, 49% said Wilson and 22% said Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 On the economy, an area widely thought by the Brown campaign to be Wilson's 
vulnerable spot, 44% of the voters said the governor would do a better job and 
32% said Democrat Brown would. The only category won by Brown was education, 
where she was favored by a wide 46%-24% margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters split on the candidates when it came to personal attributes. Asked who 
had the strongest leadership qualities, voters selected Wilson, 45% to 31%. 
Brown, however, was more popular as a candidate who "cares more about people," 
44% to 28%. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Times Poll probed the reasons voters supported or opposed a 
candidate, Wilson's incumbency and Brown's family ties -- both elements that 
the respective campaigns have stressed -- loomed large. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who thought well of Wilson, 20% said it was because he was "doing 
the best he can." Eleven percent cited his record as governor and 14% said they 
just liked him. His incumbency also cut against him, however. Among those who 
dislike Wilson, 15% said it was for his handling of the economy, 13% said he 
was ineffective, 10% disagreed with his education policies, and 10% said they 
simply didn't like him. 
</P>
<P>
 The issues Wilson has pressed are paying off for him -- 15% of those who 
favored him said it was for his views on illegal immigration, while a much 
smaller 6% of his detractors said those views turned them against him. 
Similarly, 11% supported Wilson's views on crime, while only 1% said those 
ideas hurt him. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's family ties helped propel her into the race, but the Times poll found 
that she is harmed as well as helped by her connections to two former 
governors, her father, Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr., and her brother, Edmund G. 
(Jerry) Brown Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Fully one-quarter of those who have an unfavorable impression of Brown blamed 
it on dislike for her family, while on the positive side only 12% of those who 
liked her said it was because of her family. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen percent said they disliked her for no particular reason; the same 
percentage said they liked her for no particular reason. Critics said she was 
too wishy-washy (14%) or too liberal (11%). Supporters said they agreed with 
her views (12%) and liked that she is a Democrat (10%). 
</P>
<P>
 The death penalty was a marginal drag on Brown, with 6% of her detractors 
citing it as a reason they disliked her. But only 17% of all voters could 
accurately describe Brown's position -- that she personally opposes capital 
punishment but would enforce it as governor. Almost three in every 10 voters 
thought she was personally and politically opposed to the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Brown, an illumination of her position did not raise her 
standing with voters. Sixteen percent said they would be more inclined to vote 
for her because of her position, but 26% said they would be less likely to side 
with Brown. How the Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 1,503 adults statewide, by telephone, Sept. 8-11. 
Included in the sample were 1,165 registered voters and 721 likely voters. 
Numbers were chosen from a list of all exchanges in the state. Random-digit 
dialing techniques were used so that listed and unlisted numbers could be 
contacted. Interviews were in English and Spanish. The sample was weighted 
slightly to conform more closely with census figures for sex, race, age and 
education. The margin of sampling error for the total and registered voter 
samples is plus or minus 3 percentage points; for likely voters it is 4 points. 
For certain subgroups, the error margin may be somewhat higher. Poll results 
can also be affected by factors such as the wording of questions and the order 
in which they are presented. How Voters View the Race 
</P>
<P>
 GOP Gov. Pete Wilson leads Democrat Kathleen Brown in the race for governor 
among those likely to vote in November. When voters are asked which party can 
better handle the state's problems, the GOP has a slight edge, reversing the 
trend of two years ago.

QUEBEC ELECTS SEPARATISTS, OPENS DEBATE ON SECESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG TURNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quebec voters Monday elected a separatist party to govern the province, 
launching Canada into what promises to be a debilitating yearlong struggle over 
national unity. 
</P>
<P>
 The Parti Quebecois, led by Jacques Parizeau, won 77 seats in the 125-member 
National Assembly, as the provincial parliament is called. It ousted the 
Liberal Party, which has governed for nine years and was led by Premier Daniel 
Johnson. The Liberals took 47 seats; one seat went to a splinter party. 
</P>
<P>
 The popular vote was much closer, however, with near-complete returns showing 
the Parti Quebecois edging out the Liberals by only 0.4% and failing to win a 
majority of the votes cast. Each district is decided on a winner-take-all 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
 The election gives Quebec separatists what they view as their last chance in a 
generation to achieve independence for the predominantly French-speaking 
province. Parizeau, who now becomes premier, has pledged to call a provincial 
referendum on sovereignty within 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sovereigntists have come back to power in Quebec City . . . and in 1995 we 
will ask the question that makes us a country," Parizeau told an enthusiastic 
crowd here in the provincial capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls show that a majority of the province's 4.85 million voters are opposed 
to separation, and the failure of the separatists to gain a majority of the 
popular vote underlines that sentiment. Nonetheless, the sovereigntists believe 
they can reverse the trend with a vigorous new government here. 
</P>
<P>
 No one is sure how the rest of Canada would react if Quebeckers did vote for 
sovereignty in a referendum. Speculation ranges from predictions the two states 
would part amicably, as did the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993, to 
scenarios of violent clashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, a Quebecker who strongly favors 
national unity, did not participate in the provincial campaign, apparently 
preferring to hold his fire until the coming battle over the referendum. In a 
statement following the Parti Quebecois victory, he emphasized Canada's 
strengths as a country and asked Parizeau to work with national leaders in 
solving its problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the last 127 years, we have created a tolerant, generous and united 
country. This Canada -- we can and we will continue to build it together," 
Chretien said. 
</P>
<P>
 The separatists don't have to be able to win a referendum to disrupt Canada's 
political agenda. Whatever the ultimate outcome, a bitter and encompassing 
campaign over Quebec's future could divert the nation's attention from other 
issues, such as economic and social program reforms intended to reduce the 
burgeoning national debt, among the highest in the industrial world as a 
percentage of gross domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
 It also could discourage investment and raise tensions between Quebec's 
French-speaking majority and the province's native peoples, its 
English-speaking minority and immigrant communities, all of whom generally 
oppose separation. Parizeau sought to head off such tensions Monday night by 
saying, "I want as much as I can be to be the premier of all Quebeckers." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States' stake in the future of Canada is large. Canada and the 
United States are each other's largest trading partners, longtime military 
allies and holders of the longest undefended border in the world. Traditional 
U.S. policy has been that this is an issue for Canadians to decide, and Vice 
President Al Gore repeated that line on a recent visit to Ottawa, the Canadian 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's election represents a milestone for Parizeau, a 64-year-old former 
university economics professor who embraced the independence movement in 1969. 
A graduate of the London School of Economics, Parizeau served as finance 
minister in the first Parti Quebecois government, headed by the late Rene 
Levesque, founder of the separatist movement. 
</P>
<P>
 That government lost a 1980 referendum on sovereignty, putting the separatists 
into a decade-long decline. Their hopes were revived in 1990 and 1991, with the 
failure of two successive attempts to amend the Canadian constitution to meet 
Quebec demands for special status to preserve its French language and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Parizeau's announced game plan is to move quickly and boldly on the 
sovereignty issue. Shortly after taking office later this month, Parizeau is 
expected to ask the provincial parliament to declare a "declaration of intent" 
to leave Canada. He also will appoint a commission to draw up a constitution 
for the proposed new state. 
</P>
<P>
 Parizeau also has indicated he will withdraw Quebec from a number of federal 
government programs; seek to seize jurisdiction over issues, such as fishing 
rights, traditionally controlled by the federal government; refuse to 
participate in an upcoming reform of Canada's social service programs, and 
generally contest Chretien's initiatives. In this, the Parti Quebecois will be 
assisted by its separatist allies in the federal Parliament, the Bloc 
Quebecois, led by the charismatic Lucien Bouchard. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouchard told reporters Monday that he expects conflicts between the Parizeau 
and Chretien governments, and, despite the odds, he predicted that the 
separatists will win the referendum. 
</P>
<P>
 But victory in a referendum appears problematic, given current polls, Quebec's 
history and the Parti Quebecois' failure to win a majority Monday. The central 
issue for French-speaking Quebeckers, who account for 82% of the province's 6.8 
million residents, is whether their desire to preserve their language and 
culture through independence is worth the economic uncertainties of cutting 
loose from Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Quebec campaign commanded Canadian and international attention 
because of the separatism issue, within the province the dominant issues were 
the economy, which only recently has begun to emerge from a long recession, and 
the voters' exhaustion with the Liberal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, sentiment for independence dropped steadily in the polls throughout 
the campaign, even as support for the Parti Quebecois held steady or increased. 
The latest surveys showed Quebeckers opposed to secession from Canada by about 
60% to 40%, which is the same margin by which a 1980 sovereignty referendum was 
defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, 49, became premier in January, succeeding Robert Bourassa, who 
retired because of poor health. He inherited a government that was seen by many 
voters as not caring about Quebec's jobless and unwilling to do much to correct 
chronic, double-digit unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 50-day campaign, and in the months leading up to it, Johnson sought 
to reverse that by putting forward a new economic program and simultaneously 
warning that the Parti Quebecois' focus on sovereignty would distract a 
Parizeau government from job creation. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Parizeau argued that Quebec independence would be decided in the 
promised 1995 referendum and that this election was about good government. 
Parizeau also contended that independence is necessary for Quebec to achieve 
its economic potential. 
</P>
<P>
 Chretien's absence from the campaign was criticized in some quarters. But 
federal election officials often stay out of provincial politics, and Chretien 
is sensitive to complaints in the rest of Canada that the federal government 
pays too much attention to Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Chretien is far more popular outside of Quebec than within the 
province, and an appearance on behalf of Johnson might have backfired. Chretien 
was justice minister in 1981-82 and was instrumental in helping Prime Minister 
Pierre Elliott Trudeau enact a new Canadian constitution over the lone 
opposition of the Quebec government. Many Quebeckers never have forgiven 
Chretien.

MEDIA SPEAK TO A PUBLIC RIPE TO FIND HEALTH DANGER; REPORTING: PSYCHOLOGY PLAYS 
ROLE IN PERCEPTION OF RISK. PEOPLE OFTEN FEAR TECHNOLOGY AND ARE CYNICAL OF 
INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Never before," said the congressman, "has society been confronted with a 
power so full of potential danger . . . (a) menace to our people." 
</P>
<P>
 No, he wasn't talking about nuclear energy in the 1950s or about 
electromagnetic fields in the 1990s; he was talking about the internal 
combustion engine in the 1850s. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans have always had what Michael Fumento, in his book "Science Under 
Siege," calls a "fear and loathing of technology," and that fear plays a major 
role in the central paradox of our time: 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks largely to technology, Americans are "safer than ever before," says 
Lester Lave, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. "But at 
the same time, they are more concerned about health and safety than ever 
before." 
</P>
<P>
 The news media, which should be able to alleviate public anxiety by explaining 
the benefits of modern technology -- and by putting the risks of technology in 
perspective -- instead often exacerbate anxiety with ignorant and/or alarmist 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 But risk assessment studies have repeatedly shown that despite reassurances 
from scientists (and even, at times, from the media), people are frightened by 
nuclear energy, electromagnetic fields, pesticides and other new chemicals and 
technologies precisely because they are new -- exotic, unfamiliar and, 
frequently, invisible. That's more unnerving to most people than the familiar, 
visible bicycle or swimming pool, both of which are involved in several hundred 
deaths a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Risk assessment experts say many Americans are afraid of modern technology in 
part because they have lost faith in technology. If our supposedly superior 
technology couldn't win the war in Vietnam or even rescue a few dozen hostages 
in Iran, this thinking suggests, how can it be trusted to develop safe medical 
devices, pesticides or cellular telephones. 
</P>
<P>
 Some social critics see this as part of a larger loss of faith in everything 
from government to so-called experts to the media to American industry itself. 
In this bleak view: The government lied to us about Watergate and Vietnam. The 
experts are wrong about everything from the economy to criminal trials. The 
media hide behind the 1st Amendment, but they really only want to sell papers 
and boost ratings. The automobile companies said they couldn't afford to put 
seat belts or passive restraints in cars because people wouldn't pay for them. 
The tobacco companies still say smoking cigarettes hasn't been proven to cause 
lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Can anyone be believed anymore? Or does everyone have a vested interest in 
promoting a specific agenda? Experts in risk assessment say these are key 
components in many people's perception of risk, regardless of what the experts 
or the media say: Why should I take a risk when someone else gets the benefit? 
If you enjoy smoking, fine; but I don't, so why should I have to take a chance 
on jeopardizing my health -- or why do I have to suffer the discomfort of 
inhaling your smoke? 
</P>
<P>
 But there are almost as many factors in people's perception of risk as there 
are elements in the atmosphere. The California Environmental Protection Agency 
tried to address some of those concerns this year in a 640-page comparative 
risk report urging that a higher priority be given to environmental problems 
that affect people's peace of mind and "good mental health." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as people are more likely to be suspicious of artificial pesticides than 
of natural pesticides, so are they more likely to worry about risks they cannot 
control (airplane crashes) than about risks they think they can control (car 
crashes), even though actuarial data are overwhelmingly against them. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies have shown that as many as 85% of drivers think they are "better than 
average," a perception that is disproved not only by statistical probability 
but by the statistics on highway carnage. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 40,000 Americans a year die in traffic accidents. Your chance of 
being one of them is about 1 in 6,000. Last week's tragic crash of a USAir jet 
near Pittsburgh notwithstanding, your chance of being killed in the crash of a 
First World commercial airliner, according to MIT, is 1 in 4.4 million. For a 
domestic flight, the risk is even smaller -- 1 in 11 million if you're on an 
established air carrier on a coast-to-coast flight. 
</P>
<P>
 But one-third of Americans don't even bother to wear seat belts in their cars, 
and just as the media devote far more coverage to air crashes than to highway 
deaths, so most Americans worry more about flying than about driving. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for this, of course, is that most fatal car accidents involve 
relatively few people. When a commercial airliner goes down, hundreds may die. 
That high toll -- along with the relative rarity of a major air crash -- 
powerfully concentrates both the human mind and the media spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the greatest distinction people make in evaluating risks -- 
consciously or not -- is the degree to which they willingly assume the risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Study after study has shown that people resent most strongly those risks, real 
or imagined, that have been thrust upon them -- as is the case with everything 
from pesticides to nuclear power plants; they are far more tolerant of risks 
they assume voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Transportation has estimated, for example, that 
Americans' increased preference for small cars has led to an additional 1,300 
traffic deaths annually. But no one forced Americans to buy those smaller cars 
or concealed from them the greater vulnerability to severe collision damage. 
People decided to trade off greater safety for greater fuel efficiency -- 
assuming they thought about the trade-off at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you choose to smoke, if you choose to drive a car, if you choose to 
sky-dive . . . if you choose to eat movie popcorn, those are all voluntary 
choices you're making, realizing that there's some degree of risk involved," 
says Rae Tyson, who writes about the environment for USA Today. "Being exposed 
to some chemical that's emanating from the wallboard in your living room is not 
a voluntary risk." 
</P>
<P>
 It's the involuntary risks that get the most media coverage because it's the 
involuntary risks that most outrage the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, many social scientists say, there is one overriding explanation 
for our outrage: Medical science and economic advancement have so reduced or 
eliminated many of our longstanding, legitimate fears -- and so improved our 
standard of living -- that we (in the news media and the public alike) have the 
luxury to worry about many essentially peripheral and hypothetical problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "A richer society can afford to worry more about de minimus risks," says Bud 
Ward, executive director of the National Health Center of the National Safety 
Council. "The wealthier we become, the better educated we become, probably the 
more risk-averse we're going to become. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the people in Rwanda now . . . worry much about radon or Alar 
or lead poisoning." 
</P>
<P>
 The millions of poor people in the world, the homeless and the starving, are 
not the ones calling loudly for bans on smoking, nuclear power plants, 
pesticides and silicone breast implants. Nor are they the editors of the 
newspapers or the news directors of the television stations that decide to give 
prominent play to these demands. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders of most protests against pesticides or power plants and of most 
news organizations tend to be people with higher-than-average education and 
socioeconomic status, people who can afford a desire for what the late 
political scientist Aaron Wildavsky and social anthropologist Mary Douglas 
called "a sense of individual control over social forces"; they have enough of 
a stake in the world that they want to be absolutely sure they live long enough 
to enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
 Among activists, "this want is so imperious that their demands tend to be 
'non-negotiable,' " Wildavsky and Douglas said in their book "Risk and 
Culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Many forces in society -- the media, the government, special interest groups, 
the scientific community itself -- cater to and exploit that zeal, even when it 
clearly runs contrary to good science, good government and good journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 To get reelected, most politicians pass laws and fund programs that address 
their constituents' fears rather than trying to persuade the body politic that 
common sense and medical research clearly demonstrate that a particular "risk" 
is virtually no risk at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Special interest pressure groups contribute significantly to that process. The 
environmental movement awakened Americans -- and American politicians -- to 
many serious problems, says Gregg Easterbrook, a contributing editor at 
Newsweek and the author of a forthcoming book on the environment. Because of 
these efforts, Easterbrook says, air and water pollution and toxic emissions by 
industry have all decreased, and ocean-dumping of sludge has been outlawed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Easterbrook argues that the continuing "institutional need on the part of 
the environmental movement to promote doomsday as a concept" has led to 
continuing panic campaigns that often ignore "observed facts of the natural 
world" in favor of political goals that are not always rationally defensible. 
</P>
<P>
 A doomsday scenario is "a much better fund-raiser than guarded optimism," 
Easterbrook says. 
</P>
<P>
 Even scientists are not immune to issuing doomsday scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often scientists hype and build up their own findings (to get) . . . more 
funding," says Dr. Kenneth Olden, director of the National Institute of 
Environmental Health Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 Too often, reporters uncritically accept what they're told by scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Science journalism is where political journalism was before Watergate," says 
Sharon Begley, a senior writer who covers science and the environment for 
Newsweek. "We are still too in awe of our sources. . . . We succumb to the 
fallacy that an academic does not come to an issue with the same biases or 
prejudices as someone whose salary is paid by" a chemical company or an 
environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ideology can be as strong an influence as money, if not stronger," Begley 
says, and journalists are wrong to think scientists are purely objective, 
searching for "Truth with a capital T. That's one of the most pernicious 
fallacies we as journalists can buy into and our readers or viewers tend to be 
duped into." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the media often fail to accurately communicate to the public the 
inherent limitations on science, that science is just "an approximation" of 
reality at a given point in time, subject to constant revision, says Dianne 
Dumanoski, a longtime environment writer for the Boston Globe who is now on 
leave to write a book about the effect of artificial chemicals on fetal 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 With scientists being increasingly called upon to make policy recommendations 
these days, the line between pure science and political advocacy can be 
blurred, as U.S. News & World Report pointed out in December in a lengthy story 
debunking several doomsday myths about environmental hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 A few other news organizations -- including ABC News, the New York Times and 
the New Republic -- have carried similar stories in recent years, and other 
publications -- the Washington Post, Science magazine, the Los Angeles Times 
and the Chicago Tribune among them -- have also published stories critically 
examining the conjunction of science and risk in society. Fumento examined the 
issue at considerable and provocative length in his 1993 book "Science Under 
Siege." 
</P>
<P>
 But these are isolated examples. Risk is "a very hard subject to cover well, 
and by and large, I don't think we do cover it terribly well," says Nicholas 
Wade, science and health editor of the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Journalists face many problems in trying to cover risk issues, and -- like 
Pogo in the old Walt Kelly comic strip -- they often find that "the enemy is 
us." In earlier years, journalists were often faulted for ignoring risks, 
especially in the work place; now they're faulted for overstating risks. 
</P>
<P>
 But risk issues are among the most complex to cover. They often involve not 
just science and medicine but politics and economics as well. Although some 
major news organizations have trained, experienced specialists covering risk 
areas, most do not. 
</P>
<P>
 In a survey last year of 512 print and broadcast journalists nationwide, 72% 
told the Los Angeles-based Foundation for American Communications that, in 
general, reporters lack the training and background necessary to properly cover 
stories on technical environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Social scientists Eleanor Singer and Phyllis Endreny, in their 1993 book 
"Reporting on Risk," examined 42 news stories on risk and found that 76% had 
two or more errors. 
</P>
<P>
 Because risk issues are often so technical and so complicated, even 
experienced reporters with specialized training may oversimplify issues -- 
unintentionally, while hurtling from deadline to deadline, or even 
intentionally, if only to have an impact on their first readers: their editors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Editors like conflict, drama, strong views," say Jim Detjen of the 
Philadelphia Inquirer, president of the Society for Environmental Journalists. 
"Very often, many journalists know that to get a story on the front page or to 
get their editors interested in giving them time to pursue a story," they have 
to overplay those components. 
</P>
<P>
 When an editor's desire for a strong story combines with a reporter's desire 
to be on Page 1, the result is not a pretty sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Dumanoski of the Boston Globe recalls "a big argument with a top editor at the 
Globe, on deadline" about a story in which a Harvard University scientist said 
there was "a very high probability" of a large hole in the ozone layer in the 
Northern Hemisphere before the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Dumanoski says her editor told her the story would be worthy of Page 1 only if 
the scientist said there definitely would be a large hole; "high probability" 
wasn't good enough to warrant Page 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Dumanoski thought the story was important and warranted Page 1. 
</P>
<P>
 She called the scientist back and "negotiated something that really wasn't 
accurate . . . something much balder than what was true," as she puts it now. 
</P>
<P>
 The story ran on Page 1. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to simplify complicated issues for readers, as well as for their 
editors, reporters often over simplify in other ways, allowing qualifying and 
delimiting statements of scientists to "fall by the wayside" amid overstated 
conclusions, says Boyce Rensberger, longtime science writer for the Washington 
Post. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, reporters too often fail to put a given risk in context. 
</P>
<P>
 Suppose some new substance is said to have a one in 600,000 chance of giving 
someone cancer. The government might well ban such a substance. But given that 
one out of three Americans will be found to have some kind of cancer in their 
lifetime, shouldn't the media make it clear that this additional risk is 
actually relatively slight? 
</P>
<P>
 Too often, the media fail to give readers and viewers that context. Nor do 
they point out that dire warnings in the past (about cranberries and sacharine, 
for example) have often proved needlessly alarmist -- and that science moves 
slowly toward any conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to put numbers and risk in perspective every time I write a story," 
says Cristine Russell, a special health correspondent for the Washington Post, 
who spent a year studying risk while on an Alicia Patterson Foundation 
fellowship. "I try to find just the right modifiers and emphasize when the data 
are preliminary or uncertain, whether the source is highly reputable or new, 
whether it's a large or small study, how long it will take for more research to 
come up with more definitive answers." 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Bogdanich, a former Wall Street Journal reporter who works for ABC News, 
says most good reporters try to do what Russell suggests. The mistakes they 
make, he says, are "the inherent failings of the first rough draft of history," 
as Philip Graham, then the publisher of the Washington Post, once described the 
daily newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think health and science reporters are any different than other 
reporters," says Bogdanich, who has reported often on scientific and medical 
issues. "We tend to go for the quick hit, the headlines, the news value as we 
see it . . . and we end up by failing to put in context. We end up exaggerating 
events. I'm troubled by it and always have been." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bogdanich says reporters fail to put risks in perspective, "not 
necessarily because we're bad people or we're unintelligent people or uncaring 
people but because of time constraints and the pressures of what we do for a 
living. . . . We react too quickly, without thinking, in some cases." 
</P>
<P>
 Baruch Fischhoff, a professor of engineering and public policy at Carnegie 
Mellon University and a frequent defender of the media, says, however, that 
media coverage of risk is "not always up to the standards found in other topic 
areas." 
</P>
<P>
 "Most news organizations would not tolerate sports or business reporting by 
reporters who do not understand the subject," he told Victor Cohn of the 
Washington Post for his book "Reporting on Risk." "The same is not always true 
of . . . the technical and social dimensions of risk messages." 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists say too many journalists who cover risk issues, in their zeal to 
beat the competition -- and to provide the drama of conflict and what they see 
as the fairness of balance -- often sacrifice context and perspective by going 
for predictable, controversial quotes from extremist sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Journalists want to "bracket the truth with experts or participants on either 
side" of any controversy, says Rob Stavins, who teaches environmental economics 
and public policy at Harvard. "The natural tendency, if you want to make sure 
that the truth lies somewhere within the range of what you've got, is to make 
those brackets as far apart as possible. My opinion is that's one of the 
motivations, in addition to the drama motivation, for most often quoting and 
relying upon what I call the 'flamethrowers' on either side of the spectrum." 
</P>
<P>
 Journalists would probably serve their readers better, Stavins says, if they 
narrowed that range considerably, focusing on opinions from the responsible 
middle and eliminating the extremes. 
</P>
<P>
 But even in the middle, there's almost invariably more than one opinion, and 
reporters are trained to present both sides. On risk issues, that presents a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "The journalist's model of the world (is) that there are the good guys and the 
bad guys and there's two sides to everything," says Clarence (Terry) Davies, 
director of the Center for Risk Management at Resources for the Future, a 
Washington think tank that specializes in environmental issues. "That's pretty 
distorting in terms of a lot of environmental stories, I think. There aren't 
two sides to most environmental stories; there's usually seven sides or 15 
sides. . . . Sometimes there's only one side." 
</P>
<P>
 The latter point is one Larry Stammer of the Los Angeles Times finds 
particularly unsettling. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the expertise to say that their science is wrong or someone 
else's science is right," says Stammer, a former environment reporter and 
political writer who now writes about religion. "So . . . what papers tend to 
do is give equal play to both . . . sides, even though one side doesn't have a 
whole lot of credibility. Using the political model, we do a 'he said, she 
said' story." 
</P>
<P>
 John Kenney, chairman of the commission that investigated the nuclear accident 
at Three Mile Island, had experience with this syndrome, and as a result, he 
said he expected some day to read a newspaper story that began: 
</P>
<P>
 "Three scientists by the names of Galileo, Newton and Einstein have concluded 
that the Earth is round. However, the New York Times has learned 
authoritatively that professor John Doe has exclusive evidence that the Earth 
is flat." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the biggest -- and most inevitable -- flaw in media coverage of risk 
is the tendency for bad news to drive out good news. Risk -- hazard -- is, by 
definition, bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Samuelson, in Newsweek, and Richard Harwood, in the Washington Post, 
have recently criticized this tendency of the news media to be compulsive bad 
news bearers, especially in their coverage of risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Harwood ticked off several examples of "good news" about risk, then said: 
"There's plenty to cheer about out there. We just don't print much of it. It's 
neither culturally nor commercially correct in the news business." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, when the Center for Science in the Public Interest issued periodic 
reports over the last year saying that Italian food, Chinese food, Mexican food 
and movie theater popcorn are unhealthy, their findings made Page 1 headlines 
and television news programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Media coverage of the popcorn story was especially heavy. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got the impression from the wildly excited press coverage that after a 
movie ends the ushers have to use forklifts to clear the bloated corpses out of 
the theater," wrote syndicated columnist Dave Barry. 
</P>
<P>
 But on June 27 -- two months after the popcorn report, three weeks before the 
assault on chili rellenos -- the center announced that it wanted consumers to 
know that "there's also good news in the world of food and nutrition." The 
center released a report on "Top 10 Foods for Healthy Summer Fun" -- brand-name 
lists for everything from frozen yogurt to fat-free tortilla chips. 
</P>
<P>
 A search of databases shows that not one major television news program, not 
one major magazine and only one major newspaper used the story. 
</P>
<P>
 That paper, the Dallas Morning News, gave it two paragraphs at the bottom of a 
health roundup on Page 3 of its third section. 
</P>

LOCATION MAKES WHITE HOUSE HARD TO PROTECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the frantic moments after a Cessna airplane plowed into the South lawn of 
the White House, some law enforcement officials feared that it was a District 
of Columbia police helicopter which had been hunting for fugitives in the 
streets nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 A restaurant had been robbed near FBI headquarters, less than a mile from the 
White House, and the helicopter was using its searchlight to try to spot the 
fleeing gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials' confusion points up the exceptional difficulty involved in 
providing protection from the air for the nation's most important residence in 
one of the most daunting security environments anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Close on one flank of the White House is a corridor to a major airport that 
buzzes with airline traffic day and night. Not far away are urban and suburban 
air parks and military facilities that shuttle small craft and helicopters. And 
on all sides are residential neighborhoods, businesses and public buildings 
that could make the cost very high if any craft were shot down or crashed. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you do about the poor guy whose engines quit, with three kids and his 
wife aboard, and he's looking for an open space?" asked security consultant 
Neil Livingstone. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials acknowledged Monday that it was uniformed White House Secret Service 
police who spotted the Cessna heading toward the White House from the direction 
of the nearby Washington Monument. The police only had "enough time to run for 
cover," Secret Service spokesman Carl Meyer said, adding that he did not know 
if radar had detected the low-flying plane. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Ronald Reagan and George Bush admininistrations, the Treasury 
Department or the Office of Management and Budget turned down three of four 
Secret Service requests for research and development funds for radar 
specifically tailored to the area to protect the White House, according to Joan 
Logue-Kinder, assistant Treasury secretary for public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, some $350,000 was requested and appropriated, but an additional 
$600,000 was denied the following year, Logue-Kinder said. She could not 
specify whether any money was spent to develop radar in later years, because 
the spending could have been incorporated into a larger line-item in the 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), who heads a subcommittee that oversees Secret 
Service funds, said Monday that he wants to know why the Federal Aviation 
Administration cannot deploy radar to pick up low-level aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Army has ground radar to detect low-level" planes attempting to smuggle 
illicit drugs in his home state, he said, and he questioned why similar devices 
could not ring the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with earlier detection, how do you respond to an aircraft headed for 
White House at tree-top level? experts asked. Any miss with a ground-to-air 
missile could land on an apartment house or hotel across the Potomac River or 
bring down a commercial airliner. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian M. Jenkins, deputy chairman of Kroll Associates, an international 
investigative and security consulting firm, acknowledged that there are 
"marginal improvements" that can be made with radar and related measures. But 
if an aircraft were flying down the Potomac River toward National Airport, 
which is out of the "no-fly zone" that protects the White House and other 
federal buildings, "takes a left turn at the Watergate, how long would it take" 
to reach the White House? he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Only seconds. "You can put in all the sophisticated radar in the world, and 
you're still going to have that basic vulnerability," Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins, former director of the Santa Monica-based RAND think tank's program 
on political violence and terrorism, noted that the idea of using an aircraft 
as a terrorist tool is not new. The most difficult aircraft to deal with would 
be a plane that suddenly veers off an acceptable course and heads for the White 
House, giving authorities only a few seconds warning. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving the President to "places of safety that are close at hand" would be the 
response, rather than any attempt to shoot down the aircraft, Jenkins said. 
With all the planes that regularly fly near the no fly zone, "and I suspect 
regularly violate airspace, you would have a pile of wreckage surrounding the 
White House and a lot of casualties" if attempts were made to shoot down 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, given the array of threats against the President, the aircraft 
veering off its course at the last minute "falls into the category of an exotic 
one out on the edge," Jenkins said. "If someone wants to make a kamikaze attack 
on the President, he doesn't have to go to such an elaborate scheme." 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins cited the fact that four of the last six presidents have been shot at, 
with one of them killed and another seriously wounded. If terrorists wanted to 
"go after the President, it's a lot easier for them simply to take a shot at 
him at some public appearance," especially if a would-be assassin was not 
concerned with his own safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "If security to the President were the paramount concern, then we would be 
putting the President in the middle of a mountain somewhere in Colorado and he 
would address the nation only over television," Jenkins said. "That's not the 
way politics works." 
</P>
<P>
 * PILOT'S BITTER LIFE: Frank Corder is recalled as moody, self-destructive. 
A20 Secure but Not Impenetrable 
</P>
<P>
 Some highlights in White House security history: 
</P>
<P>
 1818: First White House fence goes up along north side of the building along 
Pennsylvania Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 1950: Puerto Rican terrorists assault Blair House, across the street from the 
White House, when President Harry Truman is living there. 
</P>
<P>
 1974: A young Army private steals a helicopter from Ft. Meade, Md., and swoops 
down on the White House lawn. The man was treated for shotgun wounds and held 
for psychiatric examination. 
</P>
<P>
 1976: A man tries to ram his beat-up pickup truck through the White House 
gate. The solid steel bars stop him cold. 
</P>
<P>
 CURRENT MEASURES 
</P>
<P>
 White House precautions include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Electronic detectors line the 10-foot-high fence 
</P>
<P>
 * Visitors having to pass through metal detectors 
</P>
<P>
 * Ground-to-air missiles are available to fend off attack 
</P>
<P>
 * Heavy concrete barriers line the nearby streets to deter auto-borne suicide 
attacks

ART COLLECTOR AND PHILANTHROPIST WEISMAN DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frederick R. Weisman, a self-made multimillionaire who amassed a fortune by 
distributing Toyota automobiles and spent much of that wealth on contemporary 
art and philanthropy, has died. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
 Weisman died Sunday evening at his Holmby Hills estate after a long battle 
with pancreatic cancer, the family announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A high-profile donor who gave huge sums to cultural and social organizations, 
Weisman lived to see his name emblazoned on museums, galleries and social 
service institutions from Los Angeles to Paris. During 1993 alone -- as his 
health waned and his generosity hit its peak -- his gifts of artworks and money 
amounted to nearly $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine University in Malibu and Weisman's alma mater, the University of 
Minnesota in Minneapolis, have art museums named for the flamboyant collector. 
Pop artist Claes Oldenburg's "Spoonbridge and Cherry," the engaging centerpiece 
of the Walker Art Center's renowned sculpture garden in Minneapolis, is a gift 
from Weisman. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego Museum of Art and the New Orleans Museum of Art contain Weisman 
gallery complexes as well as artworks donated by him. The new American Center 
in Paris, which opened in June in a building designed by Los Angeles-based 
architect Frank O. Gehry, was launched with a $5-million gift from Weisman. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1975 and 1993, Weisman gave the Los Angeles County Museum of Art 34 
contemporary American works, rare Japanese screens, scrolls and woodblock 
prints whose value has escalated five or tenfold. He was a longtime LACMA 
trustee. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Weisman amassed one of the nation's largest private holdings of 
contemporary art. It was not immediately clear what will happen to that 
eclectic private collection of about 800 paintings and sculptures, said Eddie 
Fumasi, curator of the Frederick R. Weisman Art Foundation. After several 
attempts to build a new institution failed, Weisman had hoped to turn his home 
into a museum displaying the works. 
</P>
<P>
 Weisman's $1-million donation in 1993 to the Venice Family Clinic, which 
provides free medical care to the working poor and homeless, funded an 
endowment and a challenge grant to purchase property for the clinic's Frederick 
R. Weisman Program of Psychosocial Services. Weisman also gave $1 million each 
to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington and the Wilshire 
Boulevard Temple in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 These monuments bear testimony to Weisman's desire to be remembered as more 
than "some rich guy who sits around," as he put it, and to set an example for 
the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always regarded it a privilege to be able to support charitable causes," he 
said in a 1993 news release outlining his philanthropic activities. "Today I 
believe in that more strongly than ever, and I hope very much that more and 
more of our country's successful business leaders come to share that view." 
</P>
<P>
 Weisman's associates remember him as a dynamic businessman whose presence in 
the art world was marked by enthusiasm, independence and a need for 
recognition. He endeared himself to artists by helping them in lean years and 
following their careers, said Henry Hopkins, chairman of UCLA's art department, 
director of the UCLA/Armand Hammer Museum and Cultural Center and former 
director of the Weisman foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Weisman was born on April 27, 1912, the second of Russian-Jewish immigrants 
William and Mary Zekman Weisman's three sons. William Weisman got his start in 
business as a newsboy but moved up to a comfortable, middle-class lifestyle as 
he acquired property in Minneapolis, including a hotel, a mercantile business 
and a bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Zekman Weisman took her three sons to Southern California on summer 
vacations and moved to Los Angeles with the boys in 1918, when Frederick was 
six. She was a stickler for good education, Weisman recalled, and insisted on 
the best private schools, even if that meant sending her Jewish sons to Roman 
Catholic institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating in 1929 from Los Angeles High School, Frederick Weisman 
attended UCLA for a year but failed to apply himself to his studies. He 
transferred to the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis the following year. 
Although he worked part time in a hotel owned by his father, he couldn't afford 
to finish school during the Depression, so he dropped out in 1930 and returned 
to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Weisman loved to tell how he obtained a middle name -- Rand -- during his 
college days: He plucked it from the Rand Building, Minneapolis' tallest 
structure, as a symbol of his high aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
 His first independent commercial venture was a small wholesale produce 
business in Los Angeles. After his marriage in 1938 to Marcia Simon (who died 
in 1991, 10 years after the couple divorced), Weisman sold the business and 
went to work for her brother, the late Norton Simon. Val-Vita, Simon's small 
canning company, merged with Hunt Brothers Packing Co. and became known as Hunt 
Foods and later Hunt-Wesson. Weisman became president of Hunt Foods at 31 and 
stayed with the firm until 1958, when he struck it rich with an investment in 
uranium. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next 12 years, Weisman tried his hand at various ventures. He formed a 
partnership that founded Cal-Financial, a savings and loan association, 
purchased racehorses and the Tanforan racetrack near San Francisco, and 
developed a line of drugstore consumer products that he later sold to 
Boise-Cascade. 
</P>
<P>
 But he achieved his greatest financial success as head of Mid-Atlantic Toyota 
Distributors Inc. Investing $100,000 in a 20-year franchise, Weisman in 1970 
became one of three American distributors of Toyota products. His territory 
included Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and the 
District of Columbia, where he marketed cars and trucks through 121 dealers. In 
1987, the Frederick Weisman Co. -- a holding company for Weisman's various 
business interests -- was the largest privately owned revenue producer in 
Maryland, grossing $1.1 billion in sales. In addition to the automobile 
distributorship, his empire included a real estate concern, an insurance firm 
and a computer company. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of his agreement with Toyota, Weisman reluctantly sold his 
franchise back to the company in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 As his financial empire boomed, Weisman spent millions of dollars on purchases 
of contemporary artworks. He and Mrs. Weisman became a major force in Los 
Angeles' art community, supporting artists by purchasing their work, serving as 
museum trustees and hosting events that brought prominent art-world figures to 
their home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Weismans began collecting art in the late 1940s, and soon gravitated to 
European modernists and American Abstract Expressionists. Their purchases 
included works by such celebrated figures as Pablo Picasso, Max Ernst, Clyfford 
Still, Mark Rothko, Barnett Newman and Willem de Kooning. As the couple became 
increasingly involved in Los Angeles' art community, they also bought many 
works by Los Angeles-based artists. 
</P>
<P>
 In one widely publicized incident, which has assumed folkloric status in the 
art world, a drawing is said to have revived a seriously ill Weisman. He had 
been knocked unconscious in 1966 during a brawl at the Beverly Hills Hotel's 
tony Polo Lounge. According to the story, he lay abed at Cedars-Sinai Hospital 
for several days without recognizing friends or family. But when his wife 
brought their Jackson Pollock drawing to the hospital because she knew he was 
particularly fond of it, he sat up and said, "Jackson Pollock, I remember when 
we bought that." 
</P>
<P>
 He was on the mend, and the experience inspired the couple to establish a 
visual arts program -- including temporary exhibitions and gifts of art -- at 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The Weismans split their collection when they divorced in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Collecting on his own, Weisman became known as a globe-trotting acquisitor who 
bought art impetuously and voraciously on business trips. During the 1980s he 
flew around the world in his company Jetstar, which was an artwork in itself. 
Artist Edward Ruscha painted the outside of the plane as a starry midnight sky; 
Joe Goode transformed the interior into a pale blue sky graced by fluffy white 
clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 To make more space for his massive private collection, Weisman had covered the 
windows and doors inside his home. He hung paintings by Ruscha, Kenneth Noland 
and James Rosenquist on ceilings. He installed gigantic "Adam" and "Eve" 
bronzes by Fernando Botero alongside his swimming pool and set other sculptures 
outside windows, so that they could be seen from inside the house. 
</P>
<P>
 With a taste for big, boisterous, humorous artworks, as well as sober 
abstractions, Weisman installed realistic sculptures by Duane Hanson and John 
d'Andrea that were mistaken for actual people. He spoke to guests in hushed 
tones when he encountered d'Andrea's nude couple in a bathroom, as if to avoid 
disturbing them. Window washers, unaware of the collector's wit, saw Hanson's 
sculptural likeness of an old man dozing in the board room of Weisman's Century 
City office and reported that the man was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Weisman took great pleasure in art but had difficulty accounting for what he 
liked. "It's awfully hard to explain what art is," he said last year. "To me, 
it's art when it just moves me all over. I can't say I like something because 
of its texture or color or anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Weisman married Billie Milam, an art conservator, in 1992 at a ceremony in New 
Orleans, where the couple has a second art-filled home. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, he provided major financial support to the Devereux 
Foundation, which cares for two of his three children, Nancy and Daniel, who 
are severely handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his wife and the two children, he is also survived by another 
son, Richard, of Los Angeles; a brother, Theodore, and three grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services are scheduled for 2 p.m. Sunday in Wilshire Boulevard Temple, 
3663 Wilshire Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to the Venice Family 
Clinic, the Wilshire Boulevard Temple, the Frederick R. Weisman Museum of Art 
at Pepperdine or the Frederick R. Weisman Art Museum at the University of 
Minnesota.

SUICIDE SUSPECTED IN PLANE CRASH ON WHITE HOUSE LAWN; CAPITAL: THE PLANE 
CARRIED NO EXPLOSIVES AND DID NOT APPEAR DIRECTED AT THE PRESIDENT, SECRET 
SERVICE SAYS. THE PILOT HAD A HISTORY OF DRUG AND ALCOHOL PROBLEMS. 
</P>

<P>
 Secret Service officials suggested Monday that a dramatic suicide, rather than 
an assassination attempt, was the most likely motivation behind the crash on 
the White House South Lawn of a light plane piloted by Frank Eugene Corder, a 
38-year-old truck driver with a history of alcohol and drug problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane's dive onto the White House South Lawn at 1:49 a.m. Monday "does not 
appear directed toward the President," Secret Service spokesman Carl Meyer told 
reporters, warning that the conclusion was "very preliminary." 
</P>
<P>
 The plane contained no explosives or other weapons, Meyer noted, and 
investigators have found no evidence that Corder had any political grievance 
against President Clinton nor that he had ever threatened the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators did discover that Corder, who lived in Perryville, Md., 
northeast of Baltimore, had been treated last year for alcoholism at the Perry 
Point Medical Center, a Veterans Administration hospital in Maryland, had 
separated three weeks ago from his wife and had been distraught over the death 
of his father last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said during a speech to young people enrolled in national service 
programs that "we take this incident seriously because the White House is the 
people's house, and it's the job of every President who lives here to keep it 
safe and secure." 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me assure all Americans (that) the people's house will be kept safe, it 
will be kept open and the people's business will go on," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as workmen removed the debris from the wrecked plane and the Clintons 
moved back into the White House from a five-night stay across the street in 
Blair House, officials conceded that they cannot now -- and may never be able 
to -- conclusively guarantee that a pilot determined to penetrate the secured 
airspace around the White House could be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane had been detected by radar at National Airport minutes before the 
crash, federal investigators told the Washington Post. The investigators are 
now trying to determine why Secret Service officers guarding the mansion were 
not warned of the aircraft's approach. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI and Secret Service investigators plan to check Federal Aviation 
Administration records to determine what the radar showed, whether it seemed to 
indicate a threat, and what was done with the information, federal sources told 
the Post. 
</P>
<P>
 The airspace around the White House is officially restricted but is only about 
a mile from the heavily used air corridors of National Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 To protect the building, the Secret Service routinely stations sharpshooters 
on the roof and security forces have been reported to be armed with 
shoulder-fired Stinger antiaircraft missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer suggested that security measures might have been more aggressive had the 
Clintons been in the residence instead of in Blair House, the official U.S. 
residence for visiting dignitaries, where they had been living while workmen 
completed renovations on the White House heating and ventilation system. But 
Meyer declined to say precisely what different procedures might have been 
followed. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, the uniformed Secret Service agents patrolling the White House 
apparently had no inkling that Corder's plane was coming until they saw it 
heading for them only seconds before it hit, Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 No shots were fired. "I don't think there was all that much time, to be quite 
honest with you," Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House lawn became an unauthorized landing zone once before -- 20 
years ago, when an Army private stole a military helicopter and landed it on 
the lawn. The private, who was said to have mental problems, was hit by shotgun 
fire but survived. In 1976, a man tried to ram a pickup truck into the White 
House but was stopped by the steel bars of the fence. 
</P>
<P>
 According to preliminary evidence gathered by investigators, Corder, whose 
father had worked as an airplane maintenance engineer, stole the red-and-white, 
two-seat Cessna 150 trainer from a flying club at a small airport in 
northeastern Maryland, about 50 miles from Washington. He then flew southwest, 
toward the capital, crossing over the city and approaching the White House from 
the north at low altitude. 
</P>
<P>
 According to witnesses, after passing just west of the White House, Corder 
turned near the Washington Monument, apparently cut off his engines and glided 
in over a large steel fence, crashing into the lawn at a point about 90 feet 
from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane skidded up to the building, clipping a branch off a venerable 
magnolia tree planted on the White House grounds by President Andrew Jackson in 
the 1830s. The plane came to rest crumpled in a ball against the south wall of 
the White House, near the window of the White House physician's office, which 
cracked, and not far from the main entrance used for diplomatic visits. It was 
about 50 yards from the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
 Stunned security guards quickly summoned help. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing we had to determine was, what was the situation," Meyer said. 
"I mean, was this just a plane that ran out of gas, did somebody have a heart 
attack? We just didn't have a good sense of what was involved here. Or, was it 
a diversion? Was something (else) going to come?" 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency personnel had to cut the body of the dead pilot out of the wreckage. 
Others searched the plane for signs of explosives while local police sealed off 
nearby streets and fire officials hosed down the area with foam to guard 
against fire from spilled fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 About 45 minutes after the incident, White House Chief of Staff Leon E. 
Panetta called Clinton to tell him about it, Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers 
said. Until then, the Clintons had not known of the commotion taking place 
about a block away. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Clinton had visited the Aberdeen Proving Ground, an Army weapons 
development center, near where Corder's family lived, and investigators are 
looking at whether the visit might have sparked Corder's actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, whose department oversees the Secret 
Service, announced plans for a thorough investigation of White House security 
procedures to determine whether they should be tightened. Bentsen directed 
Ronald K. Noble, undersecretary of the Treasury for enforcement, to conduct the 
review and complete it within 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Noble said he could do little immediately to answer questions about how such 
an incident could take place. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's precisely the sort of question I can't answer," Noble said. "Just as 
if you had a security measure or alarm system in your house, you wouldn't give 
me the code for it, I'm not here going to give you at this point any specific 
answers until I complete the review." South Lawn Crash Site 
</P>
<P>
 A small two-seater Cessna airplane crashed onto the South Lawn of the White 
House Monday morning, killing the pilot. The plane had apparently evaded 
security by flying at treetop level. The plane's engine was turned off shortly 
before it crashed.

17 NATIONS PLEDGE TROOPS TO HAITI PEACEKEEPING FORCE; CARIBBEAN: U.S. APPEALS 
GARNER 1,500 POLICE AND MILITARY PERSONNEL. FRANCE AND CANADA DENY REQUEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration, laying the groundwork for a yearlong multinational 
occupation of Haiti, announced Monday that a total of 17 other countries have 
agreed to send 1,500 police and military personnel to the island nation -- as 
long as U.S. forces go ashore first. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the new force commitments will save the United States from 
being stuck with sole responsibility for the potentially dangerous mission of 
policing Haiti after an invasion. And that, they said, should help build public 
and congressional support for intervening. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher called a news conference to trumpet 
the 17 enlistments, which came after weeks of behind-the-scenes appeals to 
foreign leaders from President Clinton and his aides. 
</P>
<P>
 The countries that have offered to provide forces soon after U.S. forces enter 
Haiti include Britain, Israel, the Netherlands, Belgium, Argentina, Panama, 
Bolivia, Bangladesh and nine former British colonies around the Caribbean, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least six other countries, including longtime U.S. allies France and 
Canada, turned Clinton down, at least for now. Christopher aides drafted a list 
of 23 participating countries Monday morning, but they pared it back to 17 as 
it became clear that some commitments were not coming through. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher said he expects more countries to sign on in coming weeks, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly committed foreign forces are a key part of the Administration's plan 
for the transfer of power in Haiti, which officials have been revising during 
recent weeks as a U.S. invasion began to appear inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan now has three basic phases, officials said: 
</P>
<P>
 Phase 1 is the landing of an all-U.S. force of 20,000 or more troops -- either 
an invasion to dislodge Haiti's military regime or a relatively peaceful 
operation if the regime gives up power without a fight. The U.S. force will be 
responsible for securing key installations and making sure there is no armed 
resistance to the reinstallation of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 Phase 2, described by one senior official as "pacification," could begin as 
soon as 48 hours after a peaceful landing. The U.S. invasion force would be 
drawn down rapidly to perhaps 4,000. About 2,000 foreign troops -- including 
the 1,500 announced on Monday -- would arrive to keep order and begin building 
a new Haitian police force. 
</P>
<P>
 Phase 3, peacekeeping, would begin as soon as the Administration can persuade 
the United Nations to take over the job and turn the multinational intervention 
force into a U.N. peacekeeping force. Even then, the remaining force of about 
6,000 troops would still include at least 2,000 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher has said that the entire peacekeeping operation should end in 
early 1996 -- after a little more than a year. But other officials worry that 
this calendar is overly optimistic and predicted that U.S. troops will be 
needed in Haiti for at least two years after Aristide's government is restored. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials acknowledged Monday that a protracted military 
operation like the one envisioned in Haiti will require a call-up of at least 
some military reservists, a politically sensitive step. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Pentagon's post-Vietnam doctrine, many of the units most suited to 
pacification work in Haiti, such as companies trained to assist civil 
governments, have been largely transferred to the reserves. With the active 
force shrinking under pressure of budget cuts, the Pentagon clearly will need 
reservists once the initial fighting ends. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the step is sure to be controversial because the activation of 
reserve units disrupts the lives of the individuals and affects their families 
and their communities. The Pentagon avoided reserve call-ups throughout the 
Vietnam War, although the George Bush Administration activated reservists for 
the war in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, officials said Monday's announcement marked a significant 
accomplishment for the Administration, eliminating fears that the United States 
might invade Haiti and then find that none of its major allies were willing to 
share the burden of pacifying the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the foreign contingents offered are small, and the United States has 
offered to pay for transportation and other support costs for some countries, 
especially the small Caribbean island countries, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Caribbean countries that have offered to participate are Antigua, Bahamas, 
Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Guyana, Jamaica, St. Vincent, and Trinidad and 
Tobago. 
</P>
<P>
 France, which once ruled Haiti as a colonial power and has taken an active 
role in diplomacy on the issue, turned the President down flat, despite a 
personal appeal from Clinton to French President Francois Mitterrand, diplomats 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada is still considering the issue, officials said, despite a last-minute 
telephone plea from Clinton to Prime Minister Jean Chretien over the weekend. 
"We said 'no,' " a Canadian official said, "but it was a positive 'no.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Canada has already promised to send several hundred French-speaking officers 
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to Haiti to help train a new police force, 
but at this point they will wait until a U.N. force is in place. 
</P>
<P>
 At his news conference at the State Department, Christopher repeated the 
Administration's warnings that time is running out for the Haitian junta and 
said the addition of the new forces would not delay U.S. military action. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Norman Kempster and Richard A. Serrano contributed to this 
report.

 Consider the geopolitical implications of a bubble-gum cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The "love is . . ." couple sport the same long-lashed doe's eyes here as they 
do around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Baku, their saccharine messages come in triplicate -- in Russian, in 
obeisance to the great power to the north; in Turkish, the native tongue of 
most Azerbaijanis, and in English, in a wistful nod to the rest of the world. 
All that is missing is a Farsi version, to acknowledge Iran's baleful presence 
to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the multinational collage of Azerbaijan, a Caspian Sea nation of 7 
million where even bubble gum reflects the Byzantine, many-sided machinations 
of its politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing is simple and straightforward here," said Anar Kadirli, editor in 
chief of the Azerbaijan News Service. "This whole place is so complex you can't 
say anything without twists." 
</P>
<P>
 The one thing that does seem clear is that Azerbaijan is in deep trouble. One 
of the least stable of the former Soviet republics, it is awash in nearly 1 
million refugees. Average salaries are about $7 a month. Presidents are ousted, 
on average, once a year. One-fifth of Azerbaijan's territory is occupied by 
Armenian troops in a spillover from the Nagorno-Karabakh war. 
</P>
<P>
 But here is the twist: This autumn, Azerbaijan appears to be closer than ever 
to attaining the two things it most needs to make good -- billions of dollars 
in Western oil investment and peace in Nagorno-Karabakh. 
</P>
<P>
 A Western consortium that includes British Petroleum, Norway's Statoil and 
several U.S. companies expects to sign a giant deal this fall that reportedly 
will bring in more than $100 billion from Caspian Sea offshore oil over the 
next few decades. 
</P>
<P>
 And Nagorno-Karabakh -- the disputed enclave in Azerbaijan with a majority 
population of ethnic Armenians -- is enjoying its longest cease-fire since the 
territorial conflict there began more than six years ago. With the shooting 
having stopped there May 12, the negotiations appear to be making unusual 
progress, building hope that the longest-running conflict in the former Soviet 
Union may finally be near an end. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not once in the last six years of fighting have we been so close to agreeing 
on ending the war," Azerbaijani Parliament Speaker Rasul Guliyev said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 President Heydar Aliyev, 71, formerly a KGB general and member of the Soviet 
Communist Party's ruling Politburo, has held on to his seat for nearly a year, 
despite devastating military defeats and economic woes. His KGB training, one 
aide suggested, may be just what is needed to rule in Baku. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, Azerbaijan's prospects at this moment look too good to be true. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that the (oil) contract is near, we're waiting to see what they throw at 
us next," said Fuad Ahundov, a spokesman for Aliyev. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most Azerbaijanis, Ahundov is convinced that the country's troubles come 
from outside and that the main outside manipulator is their overbearing old 
friend and neighbor -- the Russian Empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow has elbowed in on the Western consortium's oil deal, announcing last 
spring that the Russian firm Lukoil had won Baku's agreement to give it 10% of 
the Azerbaijani share. It is also doing its best to push the consortium into 
pumping the oil to its West European markets through Russia rather than 
building an easier route through Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 If Russia gets too frustrated, Azerbaijani journalists and politicians 
believe, it may move to depose Aliyev and bring back Ayaz Mutalibov, the 
president ousted in 1992 who is now biding his time in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Few here doubt that, in mid-1993, Moscow helped remove the last president, 
Abulfez Elchibey, whose Popular Front was anti-Russian and pro-Turkish. Many 
also adhere to the conspiracy theory that Russia is backing Armenia in the 
Karabakh war to bring Azerbaijan to its knees; they cannot bring themselves to 
accept Baku's defeats by the seeming underdog Armenians otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 But remember the bubble-gum wrapper. Other powers are at work, and many in 
Baku hope the oil conglomerates of the West can serve as a powerful 
counterbalance to the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the West has serious interests in Azerbaijan, they'll also be interested 
in keeping Russia under control," said Isa Gambar, former Parliament Speaker 
and a leader of Aliyev's opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 He estimated that Azerbaijan lost $10 billion by giving Russia 10% of the 
consortium deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the Islamic world. Azerbaijanis may have a Soviet-bred lack of 
enthusiasm for religion. But their identity is solidly Muslim, and they are 
happy to be courted by Middle Eastern money. Saudi Arabia is already moving in 
on Azerbaijan's oil, having recently promised to invest $2 billion in an 
offshore drilling area. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey and Iran, which worries about unrest among the millions of ethnic 
Azerbaijanis who live near its northern border, also make their presence felt 
in everything from Red Crescent-sponsored refugee camps to squabbles over 
dividing the Caspian Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 19th Century, the interplay of foreign interests in and around 
Azerbaijan was dubbed "The Great Game" and pitted mainly British maneuvering in 
Central Asia and the Caucasus against Turkey and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 As far back as the turn of the century, Azerbaijani oil, discovered long 
before Texas cities like Houston came to fame, turned Baku into an eclectic 
petroleum town inhabited by Russians, Jews, Armenians, Turks -- everyone eager 
to get in on the boom. 
</P>
<P>
 It maintains an air of exotic excitement even today, from the seaside 
promenade looking out at the distant oil derricks to its walled Old City with 
the labyrinthine feel of any casbah. Russia guarded Baku jealously from 
would-be conquerors such as Adolf Hitler, who set his sights on Baku's oil to 
fuel his war effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Azerbaijan in 1994 is different. "This is nothing like the 19th-Century Great 
Game," said a Western diplomat here. "It's nothing like the 20th-Century Cold 
War. It's a third thing -- it's about new countries trying to establish 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that Azerbaijan can hardly establish itself while it is at war. 
Torn between different influences, it would have a hard time anyway finding 
itself. But its involvement in Nagorno-Karabakh and the loss of one-fifth of 
its territory to Armenian troops have magnified the typical post-Soviet 
economic and political crises. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are still struggling with their independence and getting their 
systems in place," said a Pennzoil executive here who admits it is hard to nail 
down a major oil contract when the president keeps changing. "They're still 
struggling to implement the democracy word and the free-market word." 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition leader Gambar acknowledged that the Karabakh war is hindering 
Baku's attempts to build its independent economy. Then, as is the habit here, 
he blamed Russia for Baku's problems. "Moscow's extra interest in Azerbaijan 
leads to internal instability in the country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The circle closes. The oil brings war; the war brings instability; the 
instability prevents the investment in oil. Everything stays the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Except that the status quo is unbearable. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially for refugees like Barat Berdiev, patriarch of an extended family of 
41 who were forced to leave their stone houses and vineyards in western 
Azerbaijan a year ago when the Armenians occupied their village. 
</P>
<P>
 The family members fled across the Araks River to Iran and have now ended up 
in an Iranian-run tent city in the Azerbaijani region of Sabirabad. They sleep 
on the ground, freezing in winter and sweltering in summer, each receiving 
about $2 a month in cash from the government and one small can of meat to 
supplement the camp rice and bread. 
</P>
<P>
 Berdiev, 63, sporting a fedora and fiddling his worry beads, said he dreams of 
going back to his land every minute of every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Help us," he said. "Only God knows how we'll get through this winter. May 
this war just end so that we can all go home. What are we doing here?" 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, every sixth or seventh Azerbaijani is now a refugee -- the equivalent 
of about 50 million displaced people in the United States. The burden is 
staggering. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 10% of the government's budget ($382 million in 1994) goes to refugee 
relief, said Towfik Azizov, head of the Parliament's committee on the economy, 
and an additional 35% or so to building up the Azerbaijani armed forces. Other 
estimates of Azerbaijan's defense burden range up to 70%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Karabakh war "is called a military conflict, but it is a real war with all 
its consequences -- all its grief and destruction," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It does not help that the Azerbaijani economy was already in a deep tailspin 
from broken ties with Soviet trading partners. Inflation ran at 720% for the 
first half of this year, Azizov said, and the national bank appears to have 
largely lost control of Azerbaijan's new currency, the manat. 
</P>
<P>
 Azerbaijanis on the whole are still not as bad off as Armenians, whose economy 
has been strangled by Azerbaijan's blockade of most transport routes there. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Nagorno-Karabakh war, after an estimated 20,000 dead on both sides, 
mass movements of populations and economic disaster, does seem to have reached 
the point where the gladiators are almost too tired to raise their fists. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may be an element of fatigue at work," said Deputy Foreign Minister 
Towfik Zulfugarov, who oversees the Azerbaijani side of the peace talks under 
way in Moscow. "But external forces don't let the peaceful regulation happen, 
and here, oil and politics and geopolitics and sphere of influence are all 
mixed up." 
</P>
<P>
 For all the obstacles, the outlines of what is known as the "Big Political 
Agreement" are in place, and more than half of its points have reportedly been 
agreed upon at marathon, Russian-brokered negotiations among Azerbaijan, 
Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the basic plan, the current cease-fire continues, Armenia gives back 
most conquered Azerbaijani territory, refugees from both sides are allowed to 
return, all blockades are lifted and, eventually, the status of 
Nagorno-Karabakh is agreed upon. A mixture of Russian and European troops will 
maintain the peace, it now appears. 
</P>
<P>
 The stumbling blocks remain many. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a powerful incentive to reach an agreement fast: Winter is 
coming, a grim prospect for Armenians without fuel and for the hundreds of 
thousands of Azerbaijanis without homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The sense of being on the verge of a breakthrough comes across in Baku. So 
does the dreary conviction that every time Azerbaijan gets close to success at 
anything, it trips itself up or its feet are kicked out from under it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is connected to the oil contract," said Kadirli of the Azerbaijan 
News Agency. "Every time the oil contract is about to be signed, the political 
and social situation blows up."

LOCAL SERVICE CORPS TAKES PLEDGE OF ACTION, ALTRUISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With an economics degree from UCLA, and a resume laced with honors and awards, 
22-year-old Anna Ouroumian figures she could easily command a higher salary, 
complete with impressive business cards and a lofty title -- but Ouroumian has 
her sights on a different goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent UCLA graduate from Glendale is content to spend this year working 
with a local anti-hunger project, earning a modest income. 
</P>
<P>
 Her co-workers will be people like Garland Robinson of South Los Angeles, who 
temporarily put off obtaining a master's degree to fulfill a lifelong dream of 
"working with the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Like thousands of Americans across the country, Ouroumian and Robinson have 
signed up for a "season of service" in AmeriCorps, the President's national 
service program. Monday, the two gathered at the Universal Amphitheatre with 
nearly 1,000 other participants for the mass swearing-in of the nation's first 
class of AmeriCorps workers. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, the thread uniting an otherwise disparate group of AmeriCorps 
members -- young and old, middle class and poor -- is an idealism reminiscent 
of a bygone era in American history: the belief that they can be the agents of 
change. Like a domestic Peace Corps, the AmeriCorps members will combat 
problems ranging from hunger and crime to illiteracy and pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm interested in community empowerment and . . . showing people that things 
can be done," said Ouroumian, who grew up in Glendale. "I know it sounds 
cliche-ish, but I believe anything is possible." 
</P>
<P>
 At the ceremony, AmeriCorps members listened to a string of speeches laced 
with words of encouragement and praise by Mayor Richard Riordan, Police Chief 
Willie L. Williams and U. S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Henry 
Cisneros, as well as past and present members of other service organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "AmeriCorps will rise or fall with your success this year," Cisneros said. 
"You're on the ground floor of something really big. Today is an historic 
event." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking via satellite to AmeriCorps members nationwide, President Clinton 
applauded members for their commitment to changing America and "getting things 
done." 
</P>
<P>
 "Every generation in our history has learned to take responsibility for our 
future, and your generation is no exception," Clinton said. "We look at you 
now, and we know you are no generation of slackers. Instead, you're a 
generation of doers." 
</P>
<P>
 For all its seriousness, the event, hosted by actor Andrew Shue of the 
television show "Melrose Place," seemed like a pep rally at times, with members 
breaking out in impromptu chants -- "We want Bill!" -- and songs -- "Lean On 
Me" -- while waiting for the satellite hookup. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer Patti LaBelle, who donned a black AmeriCorps cap, and the R & B group 
Immature brought the crowd to its feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like what you're doing," LaBelle said as the crowd cheered wildly. "Keep on 
striving for the positive things in life." 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece of the event was the pledge, taken by all new AmeriCorps 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing before a screen, their right hands held high, the group at the 
amphitheater listened to Clinton's words and repeated them: 
</P>
<P>
 "I will get things done for America to make our people safer, smarter and 
healthier. I will bring Americans together, to strengthen our communities. 
Faced with apathy, I will take action. Faced with conflict, I will seek common 
ground. Faced with adversity, I will persevere. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 In return for their pledge, they, like members nationwide, will receive a 
living stipend, basic health insurance, a child-care allowance and a monetary 
award for college, vocational training or to be applied toward a previous 
educational loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Trial runs of the program this summer across the nation have received mixed 
reviews. Many know that the work is difficult, especially for the pay they will 
receive. But for some, at least, the compensation is secondary to the 
life-changing experiences they expect to have during their year of service. 
</P>
<P>
 Garland Robinson sees his year as a way to help and to lay the foundation for 
a lifelong career in social work. 
</P>
<P>
 While working on a political science degree at USC, Robinson became convinced 
that his calling is social work. But with a degree in political science and no 
experience, he could not find anyone to hire him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked, 'How can I get the training if I'm not given a chance?' " he said. 
"I just wanted the chance to prove myself." 
</P>
<P>
 AmeriCorps, he said, will give him that chance and an opportunity to put to 
use the experiences that have shaped his life. 
</P>
<P>
 A self-proclaimed "product of the '60s," Robinson, 44, grew up on 27th Street 
between Central Avenue and Naomi Street. He remembers a different Los Angeles, 
one filled with communities where people knew and cared for each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a brighter time in Los Angeles, and I was part of that time," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Robinson has reason to believe in the possibility of change. In May he 
became the only one of his parents' seven children to graduate from college, 
realizing a decades-old dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a story to tell because I've been there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Robinson, who was active in student government and other organizations, 
many AmeriCorps members are no strangers to community work. 
</P>
<P>
 Ouroumian, who graduated magna cum laude in June, spent her extra time outside 
the classroom planting trees at Nickerson Garden housing projects, promoting 
environmental awareness, helping with earthquake relief and working with a 
number of service organizations at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 And last year, she spent her summer break working with residents of the 
Pico-Union area near downtown Los Angeles, organizing community members in 
Summer of Service, the pilot program for AmeriCorps. 
</P>
<P>
 "We reached so many people that I was really inspired, and that reinforced my 
belief in community service," Ouroumian said. 
</P>
<P>
 AmeriCorps is open to anyone over the age of 17, including high school 
dropouts, college graduates, students and professional school graduates. With 
these requirements, the program attracts individuals from varying backgrounds 
-- some of whom might have been overlooked by other employers. 
</P>
<P>
 Before coming to this country four years ago, Mayra Perez volunteered with the 
American Red Cross, assisting the victims of war in her native El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
 A clerk at a shoe store, she is studying for her high school equivalency 
degree and will spend her AmeriCorps year working with an anti-hunger project. 
</P>
<P>
 David Guizar, 21, was once in a gang and his brother was killed by gang 
members. He will spend a year working in his neighborhood in South Los Angeles, 
trying to help the same kinds of young people he once fought with and against. 
</P>
<P>
 "I finally got my chance," Guizar said as he waited for the ceremony to begin. 
"This is my first job. I'm part of staff. It feels pretty good, you know?" 
</P>
<P>
 Guizar will be working in the same program with Aqeela Sherrills, 25. When a 
fire at Jordan Downs housing project sparked racial tension three years ago, 
Sherrills, a resident of Watts, stepped in and served as a mediator. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherrills will spend a year with Building Up Los Angeles, where he will work 
on establishing tutoring programs, a public safety project, gang prevention and 
conflict mediation in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning next week, 40 AmeriCorps workers, including Ouroumian, Robinson and 
Perez, will be added to the Interfaith Hunger Coalition's permanent staff of 
four full-time and four part-time workers, who administer anti-hunger programs 
in the region. Its annual budget of $320,000 will increase to more than $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to enhance what we've been able to do, yet it's part of 
something that's brand new for us," said Carolyn Olney of the Southern 
California Interfaith Hunger Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps one of the biggest contributions AmeriCorps members will bring to 
community service is their familiarity with their community and its problems, 
organizers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with his life experiences, Robinson will bring a very basic message to 
the people he works with: 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand, and I am one of you," he said. "I'm just a regular person who 
cares and wants to help."

EX-SEN. HILL GETS 46-MONTH PRISON TERM FOR CORRUPTION; ETHICS: HE STILL 
PROCLAIMS INNOCENCE IN FBI STING THAT LED TO CONVICTION OF 14, INCLUDING FIVE 
STATE LEGISLATORS. CO-DEFENDANT RECEIVES 21 MONTHS.

<P>
 Still proclaiming his innocence, former state Sen. Frank Hill (R-Whittier) on 
Monday was sentenced to 46 months in federal prison for taking an illegal 
$2,500 payment from an undercover FBI agent participating in a Capitol sting 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Edward J. Garcia ordered Hill, who resigned his Senate 
seat in July after his conviction on public corruption charges, to report to 
federal prison authorities by Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentencing of Hill and a co-defendant at the federal courthouse a few 
blocks from the Capitol is expected to be one of the final public acts in a 
wide-ranging probe of corruption in state government that led to the conviction 
of 14 people, including five legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 Before sentencing, Hill made an emotional appeal, saying, "I want you to know, 
Judge Garcia, that I never, ever would trade my vote for any official action 
for $2,500 or any other amount." 
</P>
<P>
 In the hushed courtroom filled with relatives, friends and current and former 
lawmakers, the 40-year-old Hill told the veteran jurist that the greatest honor 
of his life was to be elected to the Assembly and later the Senate, but that 
"the greatest shame of my life" was having to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Garcia said the ex-lawmaker lied during the trial and issued his own 
stern warning to the once-rising Republican star. "A crime such as this is 
tantamount to anarchy because of the trust that we voters put in our elected 
officials," Garcia maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no doubts that you are guilty, Mr. Hill, based on sitting through 
three weeks of trial," Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, who received dozens of letters on Hill's behalf, including some from 
lawmakers and lobbyists with whom the judge was acquainted, could have meted 
out a sentence of up to 57 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he settled on the 46 months recommended by federal probation 
officials and ordered Hill to pay $2,650 in fines and to serve three years 
probation once released. Hill requested that he be sent to the federal prison 
camp at Lompoc. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's co-defendant, former Democratic Senate aide Terry E. Frost, was 
sentenced to 21 months behind bars, three years probation and fines totaling 
$2,050. Frost, convicted on one count of conspiracy, requested that he be sent 
to the prison camp at Boron. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. John Vincent, who prosecuted the case, voiced 
satisfaction with the sentences, even though they were at the low end of 
federal sentencing guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation began almost nine years ago. In addition to Hill, others 
convicted included former Democratic state Sens. Alan Robbins of Van Nuys, Paul 
Carpenter of Cypress and Joseph Montoya of Whittier, and former Assemblyman Pat 
Nolan (R-Glendale). All were tried before federal juries except Nolan, who 
pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of racketeering and received a 33-month 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of the case against Hill was a secretly videotaped 1988 meeting at 
the Hyatt Hotel across from the Capitol at which the former lawmaker took a 
$2,500 honorarium check from an FBI agent posing as a businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon receiving the check, Hill told the phony businessman, "We'll do 
everything we can" to win passage for a special interest bill. As part of the 
FBI sting, the legislation was intended to help a shrimp processing plant 
locate near Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on that incident, a federal jury in June found Hill guilty of extortion, 
conspiracy and money laundering. The same jurors found Frost guilty of 
conspiracy for steering an undercover agent and an informant to those who could 
help win passage of the bogus special-interest bill. Both men plan to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 In seeking to throw out his client's conviction, Hill's lawyer, Stephen 
Miller, argued that there was no evidence on the tape to show that Hill 
discussed receiving money in exchange for his help on the legislation.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; BUSH RAISES $700,000 FOR WILSON, GIVES 
HUFFINGTON PRAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Bush, who mostly shunned California while losing the presidency in 
1992, came to Santa Monica on Monday to raise $700,000 for Republican Gov. Pete 
Wilson's campaign with an eight-minute luncheon address that contained almost 
as much praise for U.S. Senate candidate Mike Huffington, a longtime Texas 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, who has been criticized as a virtual carpetbagger from Texas by 
his critics -- including some Republicans -- was described by the former 
President as "a good friend, a man who's fighting a superb battle for the 
Senate." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am delighted that Mike Huffington is here, a man I've known for a long, 
long time," said Bush, an adopted Texan. "I strongly urge you to support Mike 
Huffington. He's a good man and he'll do well in the Senate." 
</P>
<P>
 Bush did not mention, even indirectly, Wilson's Democratic reelection 
opponent, state Treasurer Kathleen Brown. In San Francisco last Thursday, First 
Lady Hillary Clinton blistered Wilson in an address on Brown's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday marked Bush's first political appearance in California since the 1992 
election, in which he became the first Republican presidential candidate to 
fail to carry the state since Barry Goldwater in 1964. Clinton won California's 
critical 54 electoral votes by a margin of 1.5 million votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tensions between Bush's campaign and the Wilson Administration in Sacramento 
ran high during the 1992 campaign. Wilson aides felt that Bush waited far too 
long to establish a campaign structure in California. When polls gave Clinton a 
strong lead in the state, the Bush effort went virtually dead in the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush's visit Monday kicked off a gold-edged political week for both Wilson and 
Brown. On Sunday, President Clinton will come to Los Angeles to speak to a 
$1,000-a-plate dinner expected to gross $1.5 million for Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown raised about $500,000 from the Hillary Clinton lunch last week, Brown 
aides said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush by no means ignored Wilson. Standing at the podium at the Museum of 
Flying at the Santa Monica Airport, he said it is impressive "to feel this 
surge for the Wilson campaign. It's just wonderful." He praised Wilson for "an 
incredible record" on issues such as illegal immigration, welfare reform, crime 
control and education. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Pete, you have a fighter," added Bush, standing in front of a massive 
American flag. 
</P>
<P>
 He also acknowledged that he has a great interest in gubernatorial races in 
two other states, Florida and Texas. Bush's son Jeb is running for governor of 
Florida and in Texas, son George W. Bush is challenging the reelection bid of 
Democrat Anne Richards, who is something of a mentor to Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson extolled Bush as "a world-class leader" whose word is respected 
throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "How nice it would be to have a President like that again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson had a retort for Hillary Clinton, who mocked Wilson on Thursday for 
writing so often to the White House, whining about problems and seeking federal 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want the Clintons to know," Wilson said. "I'll stop writing about the 
problems Washington is causing for California, if they'll start doing something 
about them." 
</P>
<P>
 He chided Brown for her pitch to middle-class Californians and said that some 
of those who have joined her in that appeal "are about as middle-class as 
Imelda Marcos." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson came to Santa Monica after conducting an official gubernatorial 
function that fits neatly into the keystone of his reelection campaign, being 
tough on crime and violent criminals. He signed into law three bills passed by 
the Legislature that crack down on inmate rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign-style signing was staged in front of the outdoor weight-training 
area at the California Institution for Men, a sprawling medium-maximum security 
prison near Chino. The more than 100 onlookers, seated on folding chairs, 
included legislative sponsors and a score of crime victims, among them Patty 
Tate, sister of actress Sharon Tate, slain by the Manson family 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Goals of the bills are to roll back "the perks and the privileges and the 
profits of crime," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guaranteed access to weight training has become a symbol of the "coddling" of 
inmates, Wilson said. One bill allows prison officials to deny such access to 
dangerous or unruly inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dangerous thugs don't deserve to pump iron in prison as if it were the local 
health club," Wilson said.

NEWS ANALYSIS; BALLOT FALLOUT EXPECTED FROM WILSON'S VETO; GAY ACTIVISTS SAY 
GOVERNOR'S REJECTION OF NEW RIGHTS FOR UNMARRIED PARTNERS WILL HURT REELECTION 
CAMPAIGN. CONSERVATIVES SAY IT WILL HELP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second time in three years, Gov. Pete Wilson has vetoed the one bill 
on his desk that the gay and lesbian community most wanted him to sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's rejection Sunday of legislation that would have granted new rights to 
unmarried partners, regardless of sexual orientation, did not provoke the kind 
of public protest that followed his veto in 1991 of a major anti-discrimination 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 But activists on all sides of the issue -- including gays and the elderly, who 
supported the bill, and religious conservatives, who opposed it -- said Monday 
that they expect the Republican governor's decision to have an impact on his 
reelection campaign against Democrat Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 A Wilson appointee who also serves as a leader of an association of gay 
Republicans criticized the veto and said his statewide group would not endorse 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), would have enabled unwed 
partners to register as domestic partners with the secretary of state and would 
have given them many of the rights now granted automatically only to married 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 They would have been able to visit each other in the hospital and to assume 
conservatorship rights if one partner became incapacitated. The bill also would 
have made it easier for unwed partners to will property to one another. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson said those goals can be achieved through other, less sweeping 
means. He took the first step by ordering his Health Services Department to 
develop regulations allowing competent adults to designate whomever they choose 
as hospital visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 In his two-page veto message, Wilson said he believes that any individual 
should be free to live with another in a relationship without marriage. But he 
said he also believes that it would be wrong for state government to encourage 
"some substitute" for marriage by recognizing domestic partners. 
</P>
<P>
 "In virtually every culture, marriage has been deservedly celebrated as a 
relationship demanding commitment and unselfish giving to one's own family -- 
especially to one's children," Wilson wrote. "Government policy ought not to 
discount marriage by offering a substitute relationship that demands much less 
and provides much less than is needed both by the children (and) by society." 
</P>
<P>
 Those words echoed the Rev. Louis Sheldon of Orange County, chairman of the 
Traditional Values Coalition, an organization of religious conservatives that 
opposed the bill. Sheldon said he believes that the measure was unnecessary and 
meant to advance a "hidden agenda" promoted by gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real underlying issue is that we will stand firm to keep the man-woman 
relationship in the context of marriage at center stage," Sheldon said. "This 
was an infringement on that." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheldon predicted that the veto would help Wilson "shore up his base among 
conservative, pro-family people." 
</P>
<P>
 Gay political leaders say they do not expect the veto to spark the explosive 
reaction that greeted the governor's veto of a sweeping gay rights bill in 
October, 1991. That closely watched bill prompted violent public protests in 
part because Wilson had indicated that he would sign it and then changed his 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Wilson this time was known to be leaning against official 
recognition for domestic partners. While some supporters of the bill held out 
hope that he would sign the measure, most assumed that he would not. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the measure's backers said Monday that the veto will help Brown 
mobilize more gays and seniors to go to the polls and vote for her. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Times poll released Monday found that 52% of registered voters 
supported the measure and 37% opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a campaign for governor which has not drawn rave reviews in the gay 
and lesbian community and not galvanized people," said Eric Bauman, president 
of the Los Angeles Stonewall Democratic Club, referring to Brown. "And I think 
we can use this to galvanize the community." 
</P>
<P>
 West Hollywood City Councilman Steve Martin said the veto was chipping away at 
the indifference that has thus far characterized the political season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised at the number of calls I got today," Martin said. "Pete's 
just stirred up a hornet's nest." 
</P>
<P>
 Anger was not confined to gay Democrats. The state Log Cabin Club, a gay 
Republican group, announced that it will not endorse Wilson because of the 
veto. 
</P>
<P>
 "There clearly is a tremendous amount of disappointment," said Frank 
Ricchiazzi, executive director of the club's political action committee and a 
Wilson appointee as assistant director of the Department of Motor Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricchiazzi said he felt like inviting Wilson and his wife to dinner with him 
and his partner. "Come over for dinner and see if we really don't have a 
family," Ricchiazzi said rhetorically to the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, asked about the bill at a Sacramento news conference Monday, said she 
would have signed it. But in keeping with her effort to court 
middle-of-the-road voters, she focused on the measure's effect on seniors and 
did not mention gays. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bill would have provided for senior citizens who are low income, middle 
income, to have enjoyed certain rights, and would have (allowed them to) enjoy 
the responsibilities of partnership," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said Wilson is underestimating how important the bill was to older 
voters. Katz said census figures show that 90% of the about 1 million 
individuals who are in unmarried partnerships are heterosexual, and he 
estimates that half of them are senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a gay and lesbian component to this issue, but there also is a 
senior component that is far more numerous," Katz said. "This is the kind of 
race where hundreds of thousands shifting here and there can be tremendously 
important. Any constituency you can swing could be very, very important."

6.3 QUAKE JOLTS BORDER AREA NEAR TAHOE; TEMBLOR: THERE IS SOME MINOR DAMAGE, 
BUT NO INJURIES ARE REPORTED IN LIGHTLY POPULATED REGION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A strong earthquake Monday in a lightly populated area along the 
California-Nevada border 20 miles southeast of Lake Tahoe broke dishes, damaged 
chimneys and shook rocks onto highways, but caused no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., put the 
preliminary magnitude at 6.3 and placed its epicenter two miles inside Nevada, 
about 12 miles south of Gardnerville. Some other seismological laboratories set 
the quake's magnitude at a weaker 6.0. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage was reported in the Nevada communities of Gardnerville and Minden and 
in California at the Alpine County seat of Markleeville, where debris fell off 
the courthouse and building inspectors were summoned for a safety evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 An aftershock measuring magnitude 5.3 was felt in the region late Monday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5:23 a.m. earthquake was felt distinctly as far away as Sacramento and 
Reno. California State Geologist James Davis said the quake was strong enough 
in Sacramento to be felt indoors by practically everyone and outdoors by most 
and caused "slight excitement." 
</P>
<P>
 Near the epicenter, some people said they were frightened. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was real scary," said Carolyn Davis, manager of the Riverview Mobile Home 
Park, six miles south of Gardnerville. "It seemed to last a long time and we 
had quite a few things break. The road in front of my trailer is crumbled and a 
bookcase turned over." 
</P>
<P>
 In Minden, Bill Henderson, director of sales at the Carson Valley Inn, said a 
television set fell off its perch, and "all of our guests came down and ate an 
early breakfast. . . . There were a lot of comments about how effective our 
wake-up system was." 
</P>
<P>
 This was the second strong earthquake felt through much of Northern California 
in the last two weeks, but both were centered well away from big cities. The 
earlier quake, now assigned a revised magnitude of 7.0 by the U.S. Geological 
Survey, occurred Sept. 1 and was centered in the ocean 90 miles southwest of 
Eureka. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists noted that the locale of Monday's earthquake was the site of 
several other quakes in the magnitude 6 range in the 19th Century. Two such 
quakes occurred within 10 hours of each other on Dec. 26 and 27, 1869, and 
other strong quakes occurred in 1860 and 1887. A magnitude 5.2 quake was felt 
in the area in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 The University of Nevada quickly sent a team of scientists to the vicinity of 
the epicenter, but there was no immediate discovery of any surface rupture. 
</P>
<P>
 A university seismologist, John Anderson, said the quake occurred about six 
miles beneath the surface and lasted only about five seconds. He and Davis said 
it was possible that it was associated with strands of the Genoa Fault, a 
horizontal, strike-slip fault. 
</P>
<P>
 Alpine County, the closest part of California to the epicenter, is the state's 
smallest in population, with fewer than 1,300 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "In surveying the town of Markleeville, it appears that most of the damage was 
to shelf stock in the local businesses," said a statement from the Alpine 
County sheriff's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bricks fell from the chimney of one house in town and some damage has been 
detected at the courthouse and the county administration building. At the 
courthouse, grout fell out of some of the exterior windows. At the 
administration building, some ceiling tiles fell to the floor and there was 
damage to some heating ducts." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the 5.3-magnitude aftershock, David Hill of the Geological Survey's 
Menlo Park regional office had said that there was about a 50-50 chance of an 
aftershock stronger than 5.0.

PROTESTANT MILITANTS PLANT BOMB ON TRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Protestant militants claimed responsibility for a bomb that injured two train 
passengers Monday and said the attack was a warning that Northern Ireland's 
Protestant majority will not be "coerced, forced or persuaded into a united 
Ireland." 
</P>
<P>
 The attack was the first in Ireland since the Irish Republican Army announced 
a cease-fire Aug. 31 in its violent 25-year campaign to drive the British from 
Northern Ireland.Britain and Ireland appealed to the IRA not to retaliate. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRA has not avenged three attacks by Protestant militants in Northern 
Ireland since the cease-fire was announced. Two Roman Catholics died in those 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said a shoe box with about 4 1/2 pounds of explosives packed inside was 
placed beneath a seat on the morning train from Belfast, Northern Ireland. As 
the train arrived in Dublin, the bomb's detonator went off -- but the rest of 
the bomb did not explode. Two women suffered cuts on their legs.

ISRAEL STEPS UP PROBE OF JEWISH EXTREMISTS IN W. BANK; MIDEAST: POLICE SUSPECT 
SEVERAL OF PLANNING TERRORIST KILLINGS OF PALESTINIANS. CRACKDOWN ORDERED BY 
RABIN BRINGS CHARGES OF HARASSMENT. 
</P>

<P>
 Israeli police Monday widened their investigation of extremist Jewish settlers 
suspected of planning terrorist killings of Palestinians in the occupied West 
Bank to foment widespread violence in the region and thus undercut peace 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Three more men were detained -- two in pre-dawn raids on their homes and the 
third, an army officer, at a military base. This brought to at least 11, 
including two army officers, to be arrested on security charges in the past two 
weeks, and senior Israeli officials said more arrests are likely. 
</P>
<P>
 Although police have refused to outline the alleged conspiracy or to specify 
charges against the suspects, Police Minister Moshe Shahal said over the 
weekend that the group was planning a major attack soon on Palestinians in the 
Jerusalem area as part of a terrorist campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stopped them just on the brink of action," Shahal said. 
</P>
<P>
 While most of the men are suspected of getting weapons and planning a series 
of terrorist attacks, some are also being questioned about the murders of three 
Palestinians in December and of a Jerusalem taxi driver three months ago, 
security officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not talking about a group of stone-throwers, Palestinians or Jews," a 
senior security official told Haaretz, the country's leading newspaper. "We are 
talking about a group of people who are suspected of planning to kill innocent 
Arab residents. . . . The detainees are suspected of activity stemming from 
ideological motives." 
</P>
<P>
 The group has been dubbed the Jewish Underground of Revenge, an informal title 
that recalls an earlier movement broken up in 1984 with the arrest of 27 
people, most of them settlers, on charges of attacking Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those detained in the past two weeks are Jewish settlers from Kiryat 
Arba, an ultranationalist settlement near the West Bank city of Hebron, where 
Baruch Goldstein, an American-born settler, massacred about 30 Palestinians in 
a mosque in February. Beaten to death by surviving Palestinians, Goldstein is 
now regarded by many in Kiryat Arba as a martyr. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's crackdown, ordered by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin with Cabinet 
approval, has brought charges of police harassment from right-wing groups and 
allegations of torture from the suspects' lawyers, and it is turning into a 
civil rights rather than a security matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Army Lt. Oren Edri, 23, arrested Sept. 2 on suspicion of obtaining arms for 
the radicals, told his attorney that he was beaten during his interrogation and 
was kept for three days in "a coffin-like cell" where rats bit him constantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is still being tortured," said Edri's father, Yitzhak, after meeting his 
son for 10 minutes in his prison cell. "They're keeping toothpaste from him, 
they won't let him pray, they're keeping toilet paper from him, they won't let 
him call home." 
</P>
<P>
 Families of several other men complained that they were not notified of the 
arrests for two days, and attorneys for virtually all the suspects objected to 
military orders barring them under Israel's tough security laws from meeting 
with their clients while they were being questioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary hearings in the cases have been heard behind closed doors, often 
without the presence of attorneys for the men. 
</P>
<P>
 "The recent arrests are a shame to the state of Israel," said Uri Ariel, the 
head of the Council of Jewish Settlements in Judea, Samaria and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel's emergency laws and the military orders in force in the West Bank 
permit the security police and army intelligence to make arrests without 
warrants, to hold detainees incommunicado for up to three weeks and to use 
"moderate physical pressure" in questioning them. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, these powers have been used largely against Palestinians, and few 
Israelis have questioned the harsh practices, even torture, instead accepting 
government arguments that such measures were necessary to counter terrorist 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Israeli public is growing angry at reports that the same tactics are 
being used against Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
 Follow Me, a right-wing group of reserve army officers, protested Edri's 
detention in a cell measuring 3 feet by 4 and his interrogation, allegedly with 
a burlap sack over his head. "It is inconceivable that an Israeli army officer 
should receive the same treatment as Palestinian murderers," the group said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerusalem Deputy Mayor Meshulam Amit, a former commander of Israel's border 
police, which is used primarily to quell Palestinian violence and enforce the 
occupation, said at a weekend demonstration that the General Security Service, 
known as Shin Bet, has to treat Jewish prisoners more gently than it does 
Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite denials from Shin Bet and police that Edri or the other detainees were 
tortured, state prosecutor Dorit Beinish ordered an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Saadia Kahalani, whose two sons are suspected of planning to attack Arabs, 
said: "Even if they had murdered an Arab, that wouldn't justify all of this 
treatment. . . . They're simply using terrorism against us."

POPULATION PLAN GETS FINAL TOUCHES; CONFERENCE: SEX AND REPRODUCTION ARE 
HANDLED FRANKLY IN COMPROMISE DRAFT. VATICAN SUPPORT REMAINS TO BE SEEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Finally clearing nagging disputes over reproductive health, birth control and 
migrant workers, U.N. drafters completed an ambitious new population plan 
Monday that U.N. officials say has allowed the world for the first time to deal 
frankly with sex and spiraling human reproduction. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, scheduled for adoption today by nearly 180 nations gathered for the 
International Conference on Population and Development, contains important 
compromises with both Roman Catholic and Islamic nations aimed at assuring that 
sex education, reproductive health care and family planning programs comply 
with each nation's own religious and cultural traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 It emphasizes that abortion is not encouraged as a family planning tool and 
leaves that contentious issue -- which at one point threatened to overtake the 
conference -- up to each nation's own legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all over but the shouting," Timothy E. Wirth, undersecretary of state 
for global affairs and the U.S. delegation chief, said of today's upcoming 
floor debate. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials said the program of action finally agreed on by the conference 
drafting committee after an exhausting series of meetings represents the 
world's first attempt to deal openly with the root causes of soaring fertility 
rates and to develop programs that emphasize not government coercion but 
individual choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The number of completely new notions compared to what has come out before -- 
of reproductive health, reproductive rights, the notion of unsafe abortion 
being a major health problem which governments have to do something about -- 
all these things are there," said Nicolaas Biegman of the Netherlands 
delegation, who was vice chairman of the drafting committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sex, something that we only whispered about before, is a normal item of 
conversation in the Western world now, and it's becoming a normal item of 
conversation in the rest of the world. This document is helping bring that 
about," Biegman said. "We are putting their noses in it. You have to talk about 
sex -- you have to talk about it just like real estate prices." 
</P>
<P>
 The diplomacy over the past week has very much reflected the growing influence 
of religion in political life. The Vatican and Islamic organizations to a great 
extent framed the debate over issues such as abortion, family planning and sex 
education in an attempt to ensure that traditional family values would not be 
lost in the rush to provide new sexual health care options. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains to be seen whether the Vatican will sign on to the document today. 
Although it contains a number of concessions over issues such as 
non-traditional marriages, abortion and sex education, the Holy See and half a 
dozen Latin American and Islamic countries continued to have reservations about 
the document. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vatican has declined to support each of the last two U.N. population 
programs, adopted in 1974 and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some time will be required to examine in greater detail the full implications 
of the complete chapter, while it is transmitted . . . to the plenary, where we 
will make a formal declaration," Vatican delegate Msgr. Diarmuid Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.N. delegates said the Holy See has demonstrated a quiet sense of realism 
in this year's debate, fighting determinedly and skillfully for concessions on 
the abortion issue, yet barely mentioning another issue to which the Catholic 
church has moral objections: artificial contraception. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't even use the word 'contraception,' " Biegman said. "The main thing 
they really, really fight for is abortion. They don't push those points which 
they know they're going to lose. As far as they're supported by other 
countries, they win. And as far as they're not supported by other nations, they 
give up." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he called attention to the Vatican's status as a sovereign state, a 
church, and a full member of the U.N. conference because of its membership in 
U.N. organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were the Vatican, I would think next time twice about sitting as a full 
participant," Biegman said. "I think they've been in a very difficult position 
because of their special position. They are a sovereign state . . . and they 
are a church, and the things are very difficult to combine." 
</P>
<P>
 A variety of Islamic nations backed the Vatican on several issues, but in the 
end, many of them said they would support the population plan as long as it was 
clear they could implement it in their own way, according to their own 
interpretations and values. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet their concerns, a new paragraph was inserted in the preamble 
emphasizing respect for religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds, 
national sovereignty and internationally recognized human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "All three of those components had to be there, or there would not have been 
an agreement," said a U.S. official who participated in the compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernando Calvijo, a Colombian who helped broker the most sensitive 
compromises, added, "The thrust of the document is that within a comprehensive 
document, there is room for individual approaches." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last-minute bargaining that consumed much of the day, these are some of 
the issues decided: 
</P>
<P>
 * On the issue of global migration, almost lost as a population issue in the 
religious debate despite its importance, a fierce argument broke out over the 
issue of family reunification for migrant workers. Countries such as Turkey, 
Algeria and Cuba, which export migrant workers, wanted to have family 
reunification declared a right. Receiving nations such as the United States, 
Canada and Australia said it was only a principle. In the end, the delegates 
used neither term, simply referring instead to existing U.N. conventions and 
urging governments to promote legislation on family reunification. 
</P>
<P>
 * The troublesome phrase "marriage and other unions," which some countries 
feared could sanction homosexuality, was left simply at "marriage" because, 
U.N. drafters said, it was "too ambiguous." 
</P>
<P>
 * In the area of adolescent sexuality, a passage calling for sexually active 
adolescents to receive contraceptive services was deleted, though it continues 
to say they should be given "special family planning information." 
</P>
<P>
 * One of the most contentious passages was the section defining reproductive 
rights, in which the document says men and women have the right "to be informed 
and to have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of 
family planning of their choice, as well as other methods of fertility 
regulation of their choice which are not against the law." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vatican and others had objected to the phrase "fertility regulation," 
saying it could mean abortion. As a compromise at the end of the day Monday, 
the wording was changed to "regulation of fertility," and a majority of nations 
approved it.

SOCIAL ISSUES; FIREFIGHTER'S DEATH FORCES TOWN TO FACE AIDS FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 To his comrades on the volunteer fire department here, David Lamson was like a 
loyal member of the family, a quiet farmer and bus driver who relished being 
part of the close-knit group that responds to local emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Lamson began suffering from mysterious fainting spells several years 
ago, there was concern among his fellow firefighters. That concern turned to 
shock and anger when they learned this spring that he was suffering from AIDS. 
The 47-year-old Lamson died of complications from the disease June 27. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery of his illness and his subsequent death have shaken the 
department in this rural section of Randolph, a quiet town of 4,800 located 23 
miles south of Montpelier. Some AIDS specialists say the town's response also 
highlights the emotions -- and sometimes misconceptions -- that arise when the 
disease strikes in small towns. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the 20-person department say they feel betrayed that Lamson, a 
four-year veteran of their unit, may have exposed them to the deadly disease 
without their knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a bond between firefighters," said Douglas Campbell, an assistant 
fire chief. "We just feel he broke that." 
</P>
<P>
 First Assistant Fire Chief Jonathan Ashworth said that members do not feel 
Lamson was obliged to tell them about his disease. "But the feeling is that . . 
. he put us in danger." 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of Lamson's death, the department has asked the town to pay for 
the costs of HIV tests for its volunteer firefighters. Campbell said most 
department members likely will be tested, even though some of their concerns 
were eased after a recent meeting with a physician specializing in AIDS 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody really wants to be sure, to put their minds at ease," Campbell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the firefighters try to come to terms with the episode, some AIDS 
advocates say the events in East Randolph dramatize the lack of understanding 
that still exists in many small towns about the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Sexton, co-chairman of the Vermont People With AIDS Coalition, said the 
fears expressed by the East Randolph firefighters show that "we are not doing 
our job well in educating people" about AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Sexton said that provided they took routine safety precautions, such as 
wearing gloves when handling blood, the firefighters had no reason to fear 
becoming infected "unless they were having sex with this individual or 
exchanging needles." 
</P>
<P>
 Terje Anderson, AIDS program chief for the Vermont Department of Health, said 
that even in this rural state, knowledge about AIDS is very high, as measured 
by surveys. The traveling AIDS quilt even made a brief stop in East Randolph 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Anderson said that in a state that has seen just 205 diagnosed cases of 
AIDS, many people have not had direct experience with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Joshua Noble, client services consultant for Vermont Cares, a Burlington-based 
AIDS service agency, said ignorance about AIDS remains strong in many Vermont 
towns, something that has created a climate of fear for those with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamson never told others in the department what was ailing him, Noble said, 
because "he was afraid how people would think about him and treat his family 
who lived there." 
</P>
<P>
 Noble said that even more than AIDS, the issue was one of homophobia, "the 
fact that this was a closeted gay man who lived among firefighters, shared 
quarters with them, spent time with them socially, and that they didn't realize 
he was gay. This was a real slap in the face to them to have to confront that 
this was going on."

ELECTIONS; RELIGIOUS RIGHT TESTS CLOUT IN MINNESOTA; INCUMBENT GOP GOVERNOR 
TRIES TO PIN EXTREMIST LABEL ON HIS CONSERVATIVE RIVAL IN PRIMARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ordinarily a genteel affair, this year's Republican gubernatorial primary has 
become a grueling test of the religious right's political appeal beyond its 
traditional Bible Belt strongholds. 
</P>
<P>
 The role of religion in Minnesota politics is the dominant theme of today's 
vote between incumbent Gov. Arne Carlson, a fiscal conservative with a moderate 
streak on social issues, and Allen Quist, a former state legislator whose 
candidacy grew out of a protest movement among the party's deeply entrenched 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprised last spring when Quist captured the state Independent Republican 
Party's endorsement, Carlson has spent much of his primary war chest of 
$900,000 in recent weeks, saturating local television with ads portraying Quist 
as a religious extremist. Carlson has compared Quist to Adolf Hitler, and aides 
have likened his followers to cult members. 
</P>
<P>
 Quist concedes that Carlson has had "some success" in cementing that image. 
And the ease of that effort comes as a warning to religious conservatives of 
the damage that can be inflicted on statewide candidates with overt ties to the 
spiritual right. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're learning is that we may have to find candidates who can't be so 
easily labeled," said the Rev. George A. Cable, a conservative Baptist minister 
and Republican Party leader who is one of Quist's most ardent supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent polls indicate that Carlson leads Quist more than 2 to 1 among 
Republican voters. 
</P>
<P>
 And while even some Quist backers are privately expecting the worst, political 
observers say Carlson's ability to turn out his supporters is uncertain. They 
add that Quist could be aided by conservative Democrats allowed to cross over 
during the open primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Stark differences between Quist and Carlson extend from their beliefs to their 
images. While Quist blames the governor for allowing Minnesota to come under 
attack from forces of moral decay, Carlson stresses his own four-year term as a 
financial manager, vetoing Democratic spending measures and bringing the state 
budget under control. 
</P>
<P>
 Quist, 49, a compact farmer with calloused hands, is the physical antithesis 
of Carlson, 59, a tall, silver-haired eminence in sack suits. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson's private life has largely escaped scrutiny -- except for the time 
that his ex-wife, Barbara, a Minneapolis radio talk show host, gave listeners 
details of their sex life. 
</P>
<P>
 Quist has not been as lucky. Within weeks of winning the endorsement of 69% of 
Republican convention delegates in June, he backpedaled as reporters and 
Carlson operatives began to mine his political career and private life for odd 
signposts. 
</P>
<P>
 Quist revealed that when his first wife, then six months pregnant, was killed 
in a tragic 1986 car accident, he buried her with the fetus enclosed in her 
arms "to express our family's grief." Former legislative colleagues described 
his "obsession" in floor speeches with curtailing pornography. In an interview, 
he insisted that men had a "genetic predisposition" to rule their families. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite trying to broaden his attack on Carlson by calling for a tax repeal, 
Quist repeatedly has returned on issues of morality, vilifying the governor for 
being too liberal. 
</P>
<P>
 In radio ads last week, Quist supporters claimed Carlson favored homosexual 
marriages and abortions in a woman's ninth month of pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 The suggestions so enraged Carlson that he filed suit Thursday against Quist 
for violating campaign laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the face of it, it's a foolish strategy," Steven Schier, professor of 
political science at Carleton College in Northfield, said of Quist's emphasis 
on moral issues. "You would think he would want to consolidate and broaden his 
base, not alienate it." 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives need a broad cross-section of Republicans, Schier and other 
political analysts say, because Minnesota's religious conservatives are too few 
in number to provide a dependable base in statewide elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The stronghold of Minnesota's religious right is in the state's remote suburbs 
and in rural areas, where young couples "just starting out . . . are worried 
about the kind of moral decay they see around them," said Darrell McKigney, the 
head of Minnesota Family Council, a conservative action group. 
</P>
<P>
 At Baptist minister Cable's Chisago Lake Baptist Church in Chisago City, an 
hour north of Minneapolis, classrooms are filled with young children learning 
ancient biblical verities. 
</P>
<P>
 Cable tries to keep his Sunday sermons free of political talk, but admitted he 
could not help castigate Carlson after he signed a gay rights measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are people who think our governor should be behind family values," Cable 
said. "Instead, we have someone who out-liberals some of our Democratic 
politicians." 
</P>
<P>
 The battle on the Republican side has overshadowed the Democratic primary. 
None of the three Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party contestants -- former police 
chief Tony Bouza, state Sen. John Marty and former state Democratic Party 
official Mike Hatch -- has generated much heat.

BRITAIN TO QUIT BOSNIA FORCE IF ARMS OKD; BALKANS: BUT LONDON WILL NOT VETO ANY 
U.S. MOVE AT UNITED NATIONS TO LIFT WEAPONS EMBARGO AGAINST MUSLIM-LED SARAJEVO 
GOVERNMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Britain warned the United States on Monday that it will remove its 
peacekeeping troops from Bosnia if Washington insists on lifting the arms 
embargo against the Muslim-led Bosnian government. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain said, however, that it will not try to veto any U.S. move at the 
United Nations to end the sanctions but rather will abstain, on the grounds 
that the United States will go ahead with such an action unilaterally. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a vote by the U.S. Congress, the Clinton Administration has set a 
deadline of Oct. 15 for the Bosnian Serb rebels to accept an international 
peace plan that gives them 49% of the republic or see the weapons embargo 
lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbs overwhelmingly rejected the peace plan in a referendum last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the U.N. was to decide to start supplying arms to one of the combatants in 
this war," said British Defense Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, "there is no way in 
which U.N. forces could remain in Bosnia on a bipartisan basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Britain and France, which have the most troops serving under the U.N. 
peacekeeping mandate in the former Yugoslav federation, have opposed a lifting 
of the arms embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Rifkind said lifting the embargo would reunite the Serbs -- now divided by the 
blockade that authorities in Belgrade, capital of Serbia and the rump 
Yugoslavia, have mounted against their intransigent Bosnian ethnic kin -- and 
invite Russian hostility. 
</P>
<P>
 In a weekend meeting, European foreign ministers condemned the possible U.S. 
decision to end the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel declared: "Lifting the embargo would give 
rise to incalculable risks and should only be considered as a solution of last 
resort. It should not be imposed unless we are sure our peacemaking efforts 
have failed." 
</P>
<P>
 And French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe added that ending the embargo was "an 
absurdity." 
</P>
<P>
 The British argue that if the arms embargo is lifted fighting will intensify 
and the position of U.N. peacekeeping forces will be untenable. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain and France are making contingency plans to evacuate troops from 
Bosnia-Herzegovina -- an operation expected to take three months. Their 
withdrawal would mean an end of the U.N. Protection Force in the ex-Yugoslav 
republics.

THEY STILL KNOW HOW TO SWING; SUNDAY AFTERNOON DANCES ARE HAPPY FEAT FOR 
SENIORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eighty-five-year-old John Kite was beginning to get happy feet. The band was 
still setting up -- heck, the drummer hadn't even shown yet -- and the canned 
cha-cha music had been turned off for awhile, but Kite was full of nervous 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, yeah," he said, slightly stooped but with glinting eyes, "I do a lot of 
dancing. You watch me out there. I'll spin 'em around." 
</P>
<P>
 And, about 20 minutes later, he does. Right from the get-go, Kite is dancing 
to "I've Got the World on a String," smiling, maybe not pirouetting with the 
zest of Fred Astaire, but having a fine time, thanks. 
</P>
<P>
 He's been doing it for the past eight years, showing up nearly every Sunday 
afternoon at the Red Lion Hotel in Costa Mesa for the weekly swing dance party 
at the hotel's Club Max. The party is well-known to lovers of big band swing 
music, particularly a core of several dozen single seniors who congregate there 
every week to meet, listen to the music and -- always -- dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Dancing is the true common ground here, a happy combination of good exercise, 
skill, direct participation and, not incidentally, a natural and benign way to 
connect with new friends of the opposite sex. 
</P>
<P>
 This is hardly a senior version of a meat-market bar or nightclub designed for 
the twenty and thirtysomethings. It's more clubby, more mannerly, more relaxed. 
The idea, said Bud Morris, who produces the parties, is simply to provide, for 
$8, enjoyable human contact to people who may have a bit less of it in their 
lives than they used to. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the regulars, Morris said, are either divorced or widowed and may need 
some encouragement to "get up off the couch and get away from the tube." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of people who come every week," Morris said. "It can be a 
little bit tough for the first-timers, but we all help them along." 
</P>
<P>
 The women, he said, seem to be better at it than the men. At first, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "The women seem to have a kind of network among themselves," Morris said. 
"They help each other to get into things. But with the men, a lot of times the 
phone isn't ringing and they end up sitting around watching the paint dry on 
the walls." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the hook is set, however, both sexes often become enthusiastic 
participants. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the women take all week planning what to wear, getting dressed up," 
Morris said, "and the men really look forward to it. It's a chance to get out 
and actually touch someone, hold them and dance with them. I kind of think of 
it as safe sex." 
</P>
<P>
 There are very few wallflowers. Most of the dancers are more like Sandy Ivey, 
61, of Huntington Beach. Divorced, he is a devotee of West Coast swing dancing 
and will perform that particular version of the classic swing dance with just 
about any woman who's game to try it. A former Arthur Murray dance instructor, 
Ivey said he has been coming to the Sunday dances at the Red Lion for two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people here are single," he said, "and it really is easy to meet people 
because everybody has that love for dancing in common." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the dancers are as polished as Ivey, however. Many are content to 
shuffle rhythmically to the music (the Tracy Wells Big Band provides it, mostly 
classic tunes from the swing era), while others try out new steps. 
</P>
<P>
 One concession to the relative age of the participants: No one has to shout to 
be heard over the music. It is lower-key swing music, and Wells has even made a 
specific note to the band members on the music order sheet, warning them to 
keep their microphones off unless they're taking solos. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a homey, almost country-clubby atmosphere. Low ceiling, earth-tone decor, 
three separate small dance floors, a horseshoe bar, a light buffet after the 
first set. The men are in slacks and casual shirts, the women in mostly bright 
summer dresses. There is a big screen TV set into one wall, but no one's 
watching it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the dancers appear to 55 or older, not all them qualify as 
senior citizens. A few appear to be in their 40s and one couple who arrived 
early for the 1 p.m. cha-cha lesson looked to be barely out of their teens. The 
young end of the spectrum is usually "about Mick Jagger age," Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is a core of dancers, small though it might be, of married couples. 
They are quite welcome, Morris said, since about half a dozen of them -- Morris 
and his wife, Ginny, included -- first met at one of the Sunday swing dance 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can happen," said Morris, smiling.

RUSHED RELATIONSHIPS; ANTI-LIBERAL DOSE OF LIMBAUGH CURES MIDDLE-AGED BLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 Live, from Orange County, it's Saturday night with the Dittohead Singles! 
</P>
<P>
 Not just bound by their solo status, this party of 30 unmarrieds also shares 
its passion for Rush Limbaugh, the big daddy of radio whose daily broadcasts 
bash liberals, "feminazis," the homeless and the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the song, they're lookin' for love in all the right places. 
</P>
<P>
 "My basic premise, actually, in starting this particular group was that if you 
meet someone who shares your same basic values, you've got a better chance to 
have a good relationship," said Donna Bradshaw, 54, a custom shelf liner from 
Santa Ana who launched Dittohead Singles a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Dittoheads are not cousins of the Coneheads or Zippy the Pinhead. It was Rush 
himself who gave his listeners this term of endearment. A caller awaiting her 
chance to address him on the air some years ago heard the caller before her 
praise the big guy. When she got her turn with Rush, she told him, "ditto to 
all that." 
</P>
<P>
 A few Saturday nights ago in an Irvine clubhouse, the monthly Dittohead 
Singles party got underway at 7:30, with men and women given name tags. 
</P>
<P>
 They're as young as the early 20s, as old as the 60s, but mostly middle-aged. 
Unlike most singles soirees, there are more men than women. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first 45 minutes, everyone views Rush videos. Dittoheads mingle over 
sodas at the bar or watch from card tables as his Rushness offers his blowtorch 
conservatism from a TV screen mounted near the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps because they already have common ground to discuss, there is none of 
that desperate singles' group pall hanging over things -- people plastered 
against the walls like at a junior high school dance or talking your ear off 
with their entire romantic history condensed into the first 10 minutes of 
introduction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi, Ed," Glinda Muirhead, 55, says from a sofa, greeting a new arrival. She 
is adorable in a polka-dotted jumpsuit and a white cowboy hat with gold stars. 
"Hi, Glinda," Ed says, "I didn't know you were a Dittohead." She admits she 
isn't, she's a Friend of Dittoheads (FOD). 
</P>
<P>
 Next are the structured mixers, which sound sort of corny but do the job. The 
first one breaks the crowd into discussion groups. Tonight's political topic, 
bias intended: "President Clinton seems to be genuinely puzzled by his low 
approval ratings. What do you think the reason is/are?" 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the confab has everyone offering at least one comment. Terry Andrews, 
in a baseball cap, spends a lot of time describing his attempts to persuade his 
Democrat kin that Clinton is a big dumb lug. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom and sister are unhappy with what he hasn't done," says Andrews, 53, a 
Costa Mesa technical writer originally from Wisconsin. "My mom says, 'Can't you 
say anything good?' I said, 'If Mr. and Mrs. Clinton won't run for President, 
that would be good.' " 
</P>
<P>
 There is a silence, then Andrews offers that he was raised in the Unitarian 
church but broke free from its grasp. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, there are at least four Dittoheads who are also Sierra Club 
conservation types -- usually viewed as liberals. Each quickly insists, to coin 
a Rushism, "I am not an environmental wacko." All guests seem to have a sense 
of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 As cake is dished up, each person is asked to describe him or herself on a 
scrap of paper they drop into a basket. Party-goers then draw the description 
of another single Dittohead, and go about trying to identify its author. 
</P>
<P>
 "Friendlier than I look," is how Jeff, 38, of Anaheim, his black hair askew, 
his cowboy boots scuffed, has described himself. What does he mean? "Well," he 
says with a smile, "I sort of look like a murderer, don't you think?" 
</P>
<P>
 He admits his three-day beard and athletic shirt are not his best effort, but 
says he is enjoying the party, only his second Dittohead get-together. "I think 
it's pretty neat," he says with a strong New York accent. 
</P>
<P>
 Up walks Laura Carder, her plastic thongs thump-thumping. She has hardly said 
a word all night about Whitewater conspiracies, welfare moms and other things 
dreaded by Dittoheads. Instead, she avidly explains both the Orange County 
Sierra Singles and SOS (Save Our State), the backers of Prop. 187, which seeks 
to exclude illegal immigrants from public schools and public health care except 
for emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you want to hear my poem?" Carder asks, beaming like a grade schooler 
about to audition for the talent show. Jeff, looking amused, says sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Carder clears her throat, straightens her body and looks straight ahead while 
reciting "Illegals," the name of her missive: "Come to California ye world's 
poor. Nowhere in the world will get you more. . . . State citizens, fed up? 
Then let's shout! 'Let's get these greedy tax suckers out!' " And so on. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff is grinning by now, clearly entertained. "I like it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Over near the bar, the conversation is animated as other singles chat about 
the clues they've drawn: "I'm left-handed," "I like to go to swap meets," or 
"I'm a person who speaks two languages". 
</P>
<P>
 "When I am an old woman I shall wear purple and spit," writes another woman, 
perhaps not looking for any long-term commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I study paranormal (psychic) activities, when I can," writes Mike Hester, 46, 
of Huntington Beach, a good-natured computer handyman who's apparently seeking 
someone equally interested in bleeding walls and Amityville. 
</P>
<P>
 Blond-haired Noel Christensen of Irvine, who cares for the elderly and is 
"over 50," stands chatting with Dan Gernak, 44, a brown-haired Garden Grove 
Dittohead in long shorts who works at Lucky's and has drawn her clue; he likes 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Hers read: "I like being very feminine. I am very sociable and creative. I am 
a GIVER rather than a TAKER. I have never had a weight problem. I like people. 
I dress uniquely. I like the outdoors and even have green eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 Though party-goers circulated with each other all night, Andrews said he's 
attended six Dittohead meetings now and has yet to get a date. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two women showed some interest but when I called them (later), they weren't," 
Andrews says days after the meeting. "Very few women want to date at all. I 
have better luck at the bowling alley. . . . It's best, I've found, not to 
discuss politics if you wanna get a date."

CAFFEINE CAMARADERIE; YOUNG PEOPLE PLUG INTO CIRCUIT OF COFFEEHOUSES, CLUBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pray tell, what's a bright, young single in Orange County to do on a Friday 
night? 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Kohbad, 23, of Laguna Hills enthusiastically treks to an ever-changing 
circuit of coffeehouses, nightclubs and bars, usually with her pals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love being single," Kohbad said at one of her favorite haunts, Rock-N-Java 
in Costa Mesa. "It gives me more opportunity to spend time with my friends and 
get crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting crazy for young singles in the '90s entails much of the same outlets 
enjoyed by previous generations: dancing, flirting, partying. But this group's 
new consciousness regarding drunk driving, AIDS and date rape has given rise to 
alternative ways to have fun. Hanging with a group of friends at coffeehouses 
has gathered steam among the young. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine out of 10 singles 18 to 34 years old have marriage on their to-do lists, 
but fewer than half had a serious romance underway, according to a Times Orange 
County Poll. Six in 10 said they spent more time with their friends than with 
dates. 
</P>
<P>
 And it just so happens that introduction through friends was cited often as 
the "best way" to meet dates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm interested in friendship, really getting to know the person more than 
sex," said Kohbad, who has a couple of dates a week. "It's not difficult to 
find single guys to date. I'm just pretty busy for any more than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Her idea of a great date? "A movie and dinner," Kohbad said, "as long as he's 
cooking." 
</P>
<P>
 As for social scenes, she and others her age say they prefer coffeehouses to 
the traditional targets, such as bars and nightclubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that they avoid those hangs entirely. "We go to clubs. But the scene here 
is a little deadbeat. I see a lot of the same people and nothing innovative is 
happening," she said. "I also think people are very superficial and standoffish 
in bars. Even I am sometimes. I don't go there to meet someone. I go there to 
dance." 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Fertig, 21, can relate. "When I go out, I don't go with the intention of 
meeting people," said Fertig, who lives in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 On this Friday night, filled with brewed gourmet bean juice, he and three 
single friends -- Brant Gage, 22, Linna Choi, 20, and Cara Tyler, 21 -- are 
just hanging out near the Rock-N-Java's outdoor Ping-Pong table. 
</P>
<P>
 Gage of San Juan Capistrano says he doesn't go out looking for a partner. "But 
I never rule out the option either," he said. "Going to a bar or club is more 
about looking for someone than talking to them. If I wanted to get to know 
someone better, I'd go to a coffeehouse." 
</P>
<P>
 The four friends, who attended Dana Hills High School together, prefer 
venturing out on group dates. It's "a lot safer and more comfortable," said 
Tyler of San Juan Capistrano. Aside from finding safety in numbers, being in a

 Unfortunately for Choi, who lives in Laguna Niguel, the duds outnumber the 
thinking studs in these parts. "People seem really shallow here," she said. 
"I'm not into yuppies or surfer dudes so that kind of rules out most O.C. men. 
I'm looking for a soul, a brain.

 "It's just really difficult to find people who you can have a conversation

DOES RISE IN BREAST CANCER CASES CONSTITUTE EPIDEMIC?; HEALTH: THE MEDIA HAVE 
IMPLICATED POLLUTION. BUT THE FACTS SUGGEST THAT EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND A LARGER 
POPULATION ARE BEHIND THE INCREASE. 
</P>

 The magazine cover is striking. A woman, clearly distraught, is naked to the 
waist -- except for what appear to be two gas masks hooked together to form a 
crude brassiere. 
</P>
<P>
 "Breast cancer cover up," says the cover line. "Why scientists ignore vital 
evidence about toxins." 
</P>
<P>
 Less graphic -- but no less scary -- many newspapers last fall published 
stories saying scientists thought pesticides in the nation's food supply "may 
be contributing to an alarming surge in breast cancer," as the Los Angeles 
Times story put it. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a widespread perception in this country -- shaped in no small measure 
by just this sort of intense coverage -- that there is a new breast cancer 
epidemic among women, much of it attributable to post-World War II 
environmental pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
 But in April, the largest study on this issue to date found no evidence that 
breast cancer is caused by pesticide residues. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean that a cause-and-effect relationship won't be found in the 
future between breast cancer and pesticides -- or some other environmental 
pollutant -- but science hasn't established that link yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Many women do have -- and die from -- breast cancer. Studies suggest that 
there is a 1-in-9 lifetime risk of the disease. But the risk of breast cancer 
rises dramatically as a woman ages, and it remains most likely to strike the 
very elderly. According to one study, a 60-year-old woman has one chance in 28 
of developing breast cancer by the time she is 70. 
</P>
<P>
 That may still warrant the tag of epidemic. It is clearly a tragedy, one 
calling for massive research and human compassion. But it is neither as new nor 
as pervasive -- especially among younger women -- as most media coverage 
suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 The age-adjusted death rate from breast cancer in this country has remained 
almost constant for 60 years. According to one study, a white woman aged 50 to 
94 has a 2.8% chance of dying of breast cancer; that same woman has a 31% 
chance of dying of heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to common perceptions, experts say, the primary reason there are more 
cases of breast cancer among younger women today is simple: There are more 
younger women -- baby boomers born between 1946 and 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall the number of new cases every year in the United States has been 
rising dramatically in recent years. Most of that increase is attributable not 
to the pernicious effects of technology but to its beneficial effects -- 
specifically new diagnostic tools. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been an enormous increase in screening, in early detection, an 
enormous increase in the number of mammographic machines around," says Malcolm 
Pike, chairman of the department of preventive medicine at USC, who has long 
specialized in the epidemiology of breast cancer. "Not all . . . (the increase) 
is due to that, but most of it" is, Pike says. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, there appears to be more breast cancer largely because we're 
able to diagnose (and treat) cases that in previous generations, we would not 
even have known about. Other factors are probably also involved in the 
increased incidence of breast cancer, but they are much less significant and 
there is little agreement on what they are and on precisely what role they 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the news media have devoted considerable space and time to the 
"new" epidemic. Breast cancer is perceived as a "hot" disease, in part because 
-- after years of neglect and discrimination -- many editors have been 
sensitized to issues of concern to women by the presence of more women in the 
nation's newsrooms. Women now make up 40% of newsroom professionals and 30% of 
executives and supervisors, the editors who decide what stories are assigned, 
covered and played prominently. 
</P>
<P>
 Many women think breast cancer, like other women's health issues, hasn't 
received enough attention in the mainstream media. On many health problems, 
they may well be right. 
</P>
<P>
 But last year, breast cancer was mentioned 5,799 times in major newspaper and 
magazine stories, according to a search of the computerized Nexis database; 
prostate cancer -- a disease that strikes only men, primarily older men -- was 
mentioned 1,742 times. 
</P>
<P>
 Breast cancer killed about 46,000 women last year; prostate cancer killed 
about 38,000 men. Thus, breast cancer claimed 22% more lives but received 233% 
more media space. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, given the influence of the media on government 
decision-makers, that difference is reflected in government spending for 
research on the two diseases. The National Cancer Institute spent $213 million 
for breast cancer research, $51 million for prostate cancer research, a 
difference (418%) that is much closer to the relative media coverage of the 
diseases than to the relative number of deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the age-adjusted death rate for prostate cancer has increased 30% over 
the past 30 years, one could legitimately argue that it is prostate cancer, not 
breast cancer, that is the "new" epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
 But one would never know that from the media. Why not? There are several 
reasons, not the least of them being that cultural forces have made breasts 
uniquely important to most women's self-image. There is a also -- perhaps 
inevitably -- a sociopolitical element to the battle against breast cancer. 
Moreover, men are generally more reluctant than women to discuss their intimate 
body parts, especially when sex or sexuality may be involved. The risk of 
impotence associated with treatment for prostate cancer makes most men 
especially squeamish. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent inroads by women notwithstanding, the key decision-makers in the 
nation's media are still predominantly male. Thus, it's probably not surprising 
that one does not see many Page 1, newsmagazine cover or 
top-of-the-evening-news stories on the prostate cancer "epidemic." Disparity in 
Spending and Coverage 
</P>
<P>
 Government spending on breast cancer research -- an opposed to prostate cancer 
research -- more closely reflects media coverage than actual death rates from 
the two diseases. 03,37,14,13 Breast Prostate Deaths (1993 deaths) 46,000 
38,000 Media Coverage* 5,799 1,742 Research Spending $213 million $51 million

NUCLEAR POWER COVERAGE FOCUSED MORBIDLY ON RISK; ENVIRONMENT: STORIES STRESSED 
ALLEGED DANGERS AND OFTEN SHOWED LITTLE SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE ISSUE. 
A GOVERNMENT TASK FORCE FOUND REPORTING ON THREE MILE ISLAND TO BE 'ABYSMALLY 
INADEQUATE.'

 Three Mile Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, 15 years after the accident and shutdown of the nuclear power plant 
near Middletown, Pa., the words conjure images of nuclear energy run amok, a 
disaster, a near-holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one was killed at Three Mile Island, and an independent review found no 
convincing evidence of increased cancer incidence in the area in the six years 
after the accident. Residents probably put themselves at greater risk driving 
away from Three Mile Island than they would have by staying. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, as the late British journalist Henry Fairlie wrote in the New 
Republic in 1989, "Three Mile Island in the American mind is an emblem of 
catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
 "At Three Mile Island," he wrote, "the fail-safe system worked. The power 
station switched itself off. There was a scare, but no disaster. Yet . . . 
nuclear power in America, as in no other nation, has been almost paralyzed" 
ever since, largely because of the scare coverage of the news media on that 
event and on nuclear energy in general. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is by now considerable documentation that public opposition to risky 
technologies rises and falls with the volume of reporting," writes Alan Mazur, 
professor of public affairs at Syracuse University and editor of the summer, 
1994, issue of the quarterly journal Risk: Health, Safety & Environment. 
</P>
<P>
 The coverage of nuclear energy -- before, during and after Three Mile Island 
-- is especially significant because nuclear energy was the first major 
political issue of the environmental movement. In fact, it helped shape that 
movement, says Dianne Dumanoski, longtime science and environment writer for 
the Boston Globe, now on leave to write a book on the impact of artificial 
chemicals on fetal development. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmental movement emerged in the 1970s, "the time that journalism was 
in the throes of post-Watergate chest-puffing," in the words of Robert Lichter, 
co-director of the Center for Media and Public Affairs in Washington.  
</P>
<P>
 "Journalists were looking for the next Watergate," Lichter says; in the 
process, "a technological issue became a political and moral issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Although some news media covered Three Mile Island responsibly, most did not. 
David Rubin, who chaired a government task force that examined the coverage, 
said confusion among government and utility officials contributed significantly 
to poor media coverage. But he also said journalists covering the accident 
"knew shockingly little about nuclear power and compounded their ignorance by 
focusing too narrowly on worst-case scenario questions." 
</P>
<P>
 The task force called the radiation coverage "abysmally inadequate" and said 
reporters had made improper comparisons and factually impossible statements and 
provided insufficient background information. 
</P>
<P>
 "To a reader or viewer trying to decide whether to pack his bags and run, 
radiation reports in the media were often as useless as a baseball score of 6-4 
that neglected to mention which teams had played," the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some coverage of nuclear energy has been worse than useless. 
</P>
<P>
 A 13-year study of nuclear coverage in seven major print and broadcast news 
outlets by Lichter's center concluded that major media coverage of nuclear 
energy in general is unfair, providing a "predominantly negative spin" that 
strongly emphasizes the alleged dangers of nuclear energy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1980s, as Charles Krauthammer, the syndicated columnist, recently 
observed in Time magazine, "the U.S. experienced a nuclear hysteria -- a 
morbid, near-panicked fear of nuclear apocalypse." This frenzy of fear was 
fanned by, among others, the "mindless media," Krauthammer wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1971, eight years before Three Mile Island, 58% of Americans polled said 
they would be willing to have nuclear power plants in their communities. The 
tide of public opinion began to turn against nuclear power throughout the 
1970s; by 1980, the year after Three Mile Island, 63% were opposed, and 28% 
were willing. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, when Paul Slovic, a professor of psychology at the University of Oregon, 
asked various groups of people to rank 30 activities and technologies in terms 
of risk, college students and members of the League of Women Voters ranked 
nuclear power as the No. 1 hazard. They judged it to be more dangerous than 
guns, smoking, alcohol, driving a car or working as a policeman. 
</P>
<P>
 Slovic, the president of Decision Research Inc. in Eugene, Ore., and a 
longtime expert on risk perception and assessment, gave the same list to 
medical and scientific experts. They rated nuclear energy No. 20 -- after all 
these other hazards and after swimming, bicycling and X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of its studies, the Center for Media and Public Affairs also conducted 
a survey that included questions on nuclear energy. The center's survey 
compared the attitudes of journalists who write about science with the 
attitudes of three groups of experts -- engineers, energy scientists and 
nuclear specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 The experts strongly favored "rapid nuclear development," by majorities 
ranging from 69% to 82%; only 24% of science journalists favored "rapid nuclear 
development." Journalists who thought reactors were "very unsafe" and who 
thought present risks were "not acceptable" and who favored a nuclear 
moratorium outnumbered the experts by margins ranging from 2-to-1 up to 8-to-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of this proves that journalists consciously set out to slant their 
reporting against nuclear energy," the center report said, and indeed most 
responsible journalists work hard to keep their personal opinions from unfairly 
influencing their stories. But journalists are only human, and some "leakage" 
from the personal to the professional, however subconscious, may at times be 
inevitable.  
</P>
<P>
 Public perceptions of risk are conditioned by much more than just the news 
media, though -- especially on an issue as volatile as nuclear energy. 
</P>
<P>
 With nuclear energy, there is the immediate specter of The Bomb. Mushroom 
clouds. Hiroshima. Nagasaki. The End of the World. 
</P>
<P>
 The Soviet nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in 1986 only compounded these fears. 
</P>
<P>
 Any mention of nuclear power evokes "echoes of the bomb," of something with 
risks that are "catastrophic rather than incremental," says Clarence (Terry) 
Davies, director of the Center for Risk Management at Resources for the Future, 
a Washington think tank that specializes in environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas Wade, science and health editor of the New York Times, says, 
"Everyone's sense of proportion seems to fly out the window as soon as you 
mention that something might be radiating." Hence the panicky reaction in many 
quarters to proposals to "irradiate" some food products to kill food-borne 
diseases and extend shelf life. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say irradiation could rid hamburger meat of new bacteria that pose "a 
clear and present danger to our public health" and that killed four people and 
made more than 500 ill last year after they ate at Jack in the Box outlets in 
the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the irradiation of fruits, 
vegetables, chicken and some dairy products; in July, a panel of medical 
experts urged the agency to approve irradiation of some hamburger meat. 
</P>
<P>
 But two states have banned irradiation, and many Americans remain convinced 
that it causes cancer, even though there has been no scientific evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Radiation from medical X-rays, including mammograms, also frightens some 
people. Doctors caution against excessive, unnecessary X-rays, for fear of the 
potential carcinogenic effects of repeated exposure, but many people worry 
unnecessarily about routine -- and medically recommended -- X-rays, as well as 
about radiation in airplanes and from video display terminals and other 
sources. Ironically -- sadly -- this fear leads some people to delay or refuse 
X-rays that could lead to the discovery, diagnosis and treatment of diseases 
far more likely to kill them than X-rays. Feeding a Nation's Nuclear Fears 
</P>
<P>
 Media coverage of nuclear energy -- and especially of Three Mile Island -- 
contributed significantly to what many scientists say is an unreasonable fear 
in the public.

EX-ADVERSARIES IN COLD WAR START JOINT MILITARY EXERCISES; EUROPE: U.S. TROOPS 
JOIN SOLDIERS FROM 12 NATIONS ON THE CONTINENT FOR MANEUVERS IN WESTERN POLAND. 
RUSSIA IS CONSPICUOUS BY ITS ABSENCE. 
</P>

<P>
 Soldiers from the United States and 12 European countries on both sides of the 
former East-West divide met on a remote training field here Monday, opening 
what military leaders called a historic era in post-Cold War cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 Onetime enemies from NATO and the now-defunct Warsaw Pact stood shoulder to 
shoulder for the first time on the soil of a former East Bloc nation in the 
first of several military exercises to be held this year under the Atlantic 
Alliance's new Partnership for Peace program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought I would be in Poland with NATO except to fight the Russians," 
said German army Capt. Lothar Pfenning, who grinned in disbelief as military 
bands blasted the national anthems of the 13 armies in this tiny town near 
Poznan in western Poland. 
</P>
<P>
 No Russian troops took part in the military maneuvers, but NATO officials said 
they were absent only because Russia joined the Partnership for Peace program 
after invitations to the event had been extended. Russian army Lt. Col. 
Alexander Strelsky, who attended as an observer, said his country did not 
participate because it recently hosted bilateral training maneuvers with the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't do everything at one time," Strelsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Russian absence was conspicuous, as was Strelsky's refusal to answer 
questions about the political dimensions of the maneuvers. Russia has made no 
secret of the discomfort it feels about NATO courting its former East Bloc 
client states. It is particularly sensitive about military activity in Poland, 
which historically has served as a buffer between Russia and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Poland, one of the most eager NATO aspirants, has been equally insistent that 
Russia not be allowed to interfere with its integration into Western 
institutions, including NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poland participated in World War II along with the Allied forces as a winner 
but, because of the political solution that came after the war, fell under the 
influence of the Soviet Union," said Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak. 
"These military exercises taking place 50 years after the end of World War II 
bring a new dimension to European cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
 In opening the five-day exercises, U.S. Gen. George A. Joulwan, NATO's supreme 
Allied commander in Europe, said the meeting of Eastern and Western forces 
marked a new chapter in European history. Joulwan said the once-hostile armies 
should start acting as "the vanguard" of a peaceful Continent "from the 
Atlantic to the Urals," language clearly intended to comfort the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five years ago, we traced each other across an Iron Curtain as adversaries," 
Joulwan said. "Today we come together to train as partners and friends, 
dedicated to building a Europe whole and free, democratic and at peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Poland and other East European countries view the weeklong exercises as an 
important step toward eventual NATO membership, even though NATO has offered no 
such assurances. The meeting was originally intended as a bilateral 
Polish-American maneuver but was expanded to include NATO and the Partnership 
for Peace countries at the urging of the Poles, who wanted the distinction of 
being the first country to host such an event. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO, meanwhile, was eager to show off its popularity among its former 
enemies, especially on the territory of one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to make sure the first exercise was in Eastern Europe so it didn't 
look like NATO was spoon-feeding the Partnership for Peace program to the 
Eastern countries," said one NATO official who asked not to be identified. 
"This way it is a politically significant event." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, although billed as a military exercise, the assembly of 920 soldiers 
from six NATO and seven former Warsaw Pact countries was mostly a political 
event played out before hundreds of journalists and political leaders from 
Poland and across Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers interrupted maneuvers for television cameras and on-the-spot 
interviews, although the public relations extravaganza got sticky several times 
when rifle-toting soldiers mistook media convoys for military decoys and 
ordered them off the road. 
</P>
<P>
 The exercise included no mock battles, concentrating instead on peacekeeping 
activities envisioned under the Partnership for Peace program. NATO foreign 
ministers endorsed it in January as a way to integrate former Eastern 
adversaries and nonaligned European countries into NATO peacekeeping 
operations, with the possibility of other cooperation. Twenty-two countries 
have signed partnership agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 In the course of the week, soldiers will sightsee in Poznan, attend rock 
concerts, lift weights, go to church and compete in sports events, but they 
will participate in only one battle exercise: a shooting contest at a firing 
range. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is mostly a dog-and-pony show," said U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Robert Fox. 
"This is very low-stress compared to the way we normally train." 
</P>
<P>
 But Fox and other soldiers -- from the United States, Britain, Bulgaria, the 
Czech Republic, Denmark, Italy, Germany, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, 
Romania, Slovakia and Ukraine -- said the exercises had already given them a 
chance to meet other soldiers in a noncombat environment. Many said they had 
made good friends among armies on the other side of the former Cold War divide, 
exchanging gifts and drinking beer into the late evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are soldiers here and not politicians, and that makes it easy," said 
Bulgarian army Maj. Angel Dimitrov. "The last person who wants to go to war is 
a soldier."

PLANE CRASH AT THE WHITE HOUSE; PILOT IN CRASH LED A TORMENTED LIFE; PROFILE: 
THOSE WHO KNEW HIM SAID HE HAD PROBLEMS WITH DRUGS, ALCOHOL, BUSINESS VENTURES 
AND RELATIONSHIPS. 
</P>

<P>
 Frank Eugene Corder's bizarre and very public death came as a shock to those 
who knew him in the rural Maryland communities where he had lived. That he died 
violently did not. 
</P>
<P>
 Tormented for years by drugs and alcohol, business failures and broken 
relationships, the 38-year-old unemployed truck driver had a melancholy, even 
self-destructive side that made his few friends dread the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frank has been down on drugs and alcohol before. He told me that sometimes . 
. . he just wished he had a gun," said a cousin, Delilah George of Havre de 
Grace, Md., just a few miles up the road from Perryville, where Corder last 
lived. 
</P>
<P>
 But what surprised the few people who knew Corder was the spectacular nature 
of his final act. While his dreams were expansive -- he loved airplanes and was 
said to have fantasies about running a major airline -- his life was cramped 
and quiet, a succession of disappointments punctuated by binges of booze and 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 He was moody, uncommunicative and virtually friendless, according to neighbors 
and relatives. Alfred Davisson, his next-door neighbor on Avenue C in 
Perryville, said he rarely saw Corder and knew nothing about him or his 
estranged wife, Lydia, a licensed practical nurse at the nearby Veterans 
Administration hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 His older brother, John, and other relatives said Corder alternated between 
"dynamic" moments of high hopes and periods of black despair and alcoholic 
oblivion. John Corder, his brother's sometime business partner and his closest 
friend, said he had not seen Frank for three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last 16 months, Corder's father died, his trucking business collapsed 
and his marriage dissolved. His mother is seriously ill with cancer. He was 
barred from flying because of his history of drug and alcohol abuse. He could 
not pay his living expenses or his drug debts. The Baptist minister who 
consoled him after his father's death and persuaded him to seek treatment for 
his alcoholism moved out of the area, deepening his isolation. 
</P>
<P>
 While Frank Corder entered a seven-day detoxification program last year at the 
VA's Perry Point Medical Center, relatives said they suspected he had been 
drinking and using cocaine heavily in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 George said that she spoke to Frank Corder late last week and that he was 
living "on the streets," which, she said, happened occasionally when he was on 
a drug or alcohol binge. 
</P>
<P>
 His aunt, Edith Dishman of Aberdeen, Md., said that when he was on a binge, 
"he would get all the drugs he could get. It was a stupid act. . . . It's like 
the devil getting hold of him." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that Frank Corder had no history of violence and that she had never 
heard him discuss suicide. And she does not believe that he intended to harm 
President Clinton or his family. 
</P>
<P>
 George agreed, saying that Frank Corder admired Clinton and once said: 
"Anybody who can say on TV that he smoked pot, even if he didn't inhale, is OK 
with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Corder thought that his father had never loved him, she said. "This was 
a way of proving, 'Hey, I exist too,' " she said. "He was wanting to be 
recognized." 
</P>
<P>
 George added that John Corder had told her his brother had a fascination with 
German teen-ager Mathias Rust, who evaded Soviet security and landed a light 
plane in Moscow's Red Square in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Corder grew up in a trim one-story house on Darlington Avenue in 
Aberdeen. His ailing mother still lives there. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, William, was an aircraft mechanic and a licensed pilot. Their 
father used to take them up for rides. 
</P>
<P>
 When he signed up to take flying lessons at the Harford County Air Park a few 
years ago, his father warned the instructor, Joseph Kesser, that Frank had drug 
problems and should not be allowed anywhere near a cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
 Kesser, who is a co-owner of the Cessna that Frank Corder stole Sunday night, 
said that a Maryland state trooper also warned him of his student's substance 
abuse problem. Kesser ended his instruction after one lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 "He talked big," said Kesser. "He had big dreams of starting an airline. He 
had champagne tastes and a Pepsi Cola wallet." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Corder dropped out of high school and briefly served in the military, 
relatives said. Army records do not indicate why he was discharged after six 
months but his aunt said that he left high school because he had a drinking 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 John Corder said that his brother had been married twice before, with both 
marriages ending in divorce. He has one child.

PLANE CRASH AT THE WHITE HOUSE; PLANE STRUCK OLDEST WHITE HOUSE TREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tree struck by the light plane that crashed outside the White House is the 
oldest on the grounds of the Executive Mansion -- a towering southern magnolia 
planted more than 150 years ago by President Andrew Jackson as a memorial to 
his wife. She died just before he took office. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane apparently hit the ground and then struck the tree, severing a limb 
but doing no further damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson planted the tree sometime during his two terms in office -- between 
1829 and 1837 -- but no more precise date is known, according to Neel 
Lattimore, a White House spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the graceful tree -- as depicted on the back of the $20 bill -- stands 
at the center of a small terrace, shading the tall windows of the State Dining 
Room and the residential quarters above it. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane struck the magnolia at a point just under the one first-floor window 
that is visible (the Red Room) to the left of the steps leading from the South 
Portico to the South Lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnolia is a graft of one from the grounds of the Hermitage, Jackson's 
home outside Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Steeped in White House lore, the tree reflected the unusually deep feelings 
that Jackson, whose nickname was "Old Hickory," had for his wife, Rachel 
Donelson Robards. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1806, Jackson killed Charles Dickinsin, a fellow Nashville attorney, in a 
duel because Jackson believed that Dickinsin had spread scurrilous gossip about 
Mrs. Jackson. EDWIN CHEN

2,000 GATHER TO MOURN VICTIMS WHO DIED IN CRASH OF FLIGHT 427 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hymns echoed softly through a crowded downtown square Monday as 2,000 people 
gathered at lunchtime to mourn the victims of USAir Flight 427. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe God will give me some answers to what happened," said Pam Kastelmeyer, 
whose neighbor's daughter was among 132 people killed when the jet crashed 
Thursday in a wooded ravine. 
</P>
<P>
 Some were stoic through several prayers, but they broke down and sobbed when a 
priest read the names of the dead. A wreath stood in front of a stage on Market 
Square, in the business district. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators continued to search for clues Monday. They were trying to 
determine if the right engine went into reverse before the plane nose-dived. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told investigators the jet rolled to the left before it crashed. 
John Nance, an air safety analyst in Seattle, said that if the right engine's 
thrust was reversed, the plane would have rolled right. 
</P>
<P>
 He cautioned that "this impact was so horrendous and the scattered parts so 
thoroughly hashed up that no conclusion right now, no matter how obvious it 
might seem, can be relied on." 
</P>
<P>
 Boeing Co. officials also cast doubt on the theory that a flaw in the thrust 
reverser system in one engine caused the Boeing 737 jetliner to crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeing spokesman Steve Thieme said it would be virtually impossible for the 
braking system to partially deploy. "Because of the design of the system, we 
don't know how that could happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Thieme said, Boeing engineers will use simulators to determine 
if such a scenario could have occurred.

STARR NAMES HIS FIRST WHITEWATER AIDES; INVESTIGATION: INDEPENDENT COUNSEL 
ANNOUNCES APPOINTMENTS TO FILL OUT PROSECUTION TEAM. HE NAMES A FISKE HOLDOVER 
AS A TOP DEPUTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Newly named independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr on Monday announced his first 
appointments to fill out his Whitewater prosecution team and begin the 
transition from outgoing prosecutor Robert B. Fiske Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Starr, a Republican who has been characterized as overly partisan by 
supporters of President Clinton, named two attorneys as his top deputies, 
including one holdover from Fiske's team. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he appointed four more staff attorneys to continue the 
Whitewater-related investigations in offices in Washington and Little Rock, 
Ark., including one holdover from Fiske's staff and others with strong ties to 
Republican legal circles. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske's staff pledged to provide an "orderly transition." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources familiar with the special counsel's inquiry said the transition to 
Starr appears to have led to delays in the probe, but that Starr may be in a 
position soon to decide whether to seek quick indictments based on Fiske's 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 The first indictments probably would reflect the grand jury testimony of 
former Arkansas municipal judge David Hale, who alleges that he was pressured 
to make illegal loans to Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, which was owned by 
James B. McDougal, the partner of Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton 
in the Whitewater real estate venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the Clintons nor other current members of the Administration would be 
likely to be among those named in these possible early indictments. 
</P>
<P>
 Starr, solicitor general under former President George Bush, named Mark H. 
Tuohey as deputy independent counsel based in Washington, and William S. Duffey 
Jr., as deputy independent counsel based in Little Rock. Tuohey, who served in 
the Justice Department in the Jimmy Carter Administration, is now a partner in 
a Washington law firm and over the last year has served as president of the 
Washington, D.C., bar association. Duffey, an Atlanta lawyer, has been working 
in the special prosecutor's Little Rock office under Fiske since February. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell (Rusty) Hardin Jr., another Fiske holdover, will continue as associate 
independent counsel in Little Rock and as senior trial counsel to Starr. Starr 
named Hickman Ewing Jr. as senior counsel in the special counsel's Little Rock 
office. Ewing was a U.S. attorney in Tennessee under Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he named Alex M. Azar and Brett Kavanaugh as assistant 
independent counsels in Washington. Azar, an associate in Starr's Washington 
law firm, once served as a law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. 
Kavanaugh was a law clerk for conservative Judge Alex Kozinski on the U.S. 9th 
Circuit Court of Appeals and worked for Starr in the Bush Administration 
Justice Department.

STIFF DRUG LAWS CITED FOR RECORD INCARCERATION RATE; CRIME: SENTENCING REPORT 
SAYS 60% OF FEDERAL PRISONERS AND 25% OF STATE INMATES SERVE TIME FOR 
NARCOTICS. CALIFORNIA TOPS RATE FOR PEOPLE BEHIND BARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The percentage of Americans who were locked behind bars reached an all-time 
high last year, thanks largely to stiffer anti-drug laws enacted during the 
1980s, according to a report released Monday that analyzes sentencing patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 About 519 of every 100,000 persons in the United States were in prison or jail 
last year, a rate 22% higher than in 1989, said the Sentencing Project, a 
liberal, nonprofit group. The incarceration rate in the United States is five 
to eight times higher than in most industrial nations, the report said, and is 
second only to that of Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 California has an even higher rate of imprisonment: 626 per 100,000, according 
to a separate report. 
</P>
<P>
 "If California were a nation, it would be world's leader in incarceration," 
said Vincent Schiraldi of the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 While vicious attacks perpetrated by career criminals have fueled the demand 
for the tougher sentencing laws in Washington and in Sacramento, the authors of 
the national and California reports say the prisons are being filled by those 
who sell and use illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, more than 60% of all federal inmates, and 25% of state prisoners, 
are there on drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1980s, Congress enacted a series of new laws that set stiff 
mandatory-minimum prison terms for persons convicted of selling or possessing 
narcotics. Most states enacted similar measures. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, these new anti-drug laws do not allow convicts to be paroled 
early. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the decade, these measures have brought about a dramatic change in the 
prison population. In 1983, about 7% of state inmates were there for drug 
charges. Last year, the figure had risen to 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 In the federal system, the percentage of inmates serving time for drug 
offenses rose from 27% in 1983 to 61% last year. The U.S. Bureau of Prisons 
estimates that 70% of its inmates will be serving time for drug crimes by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts disagree on whether the increase in prison population has had the 
effect of reducing the crime rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Sentencing Project say that incarceration is expensive -- 
more than $20,000 per inmate per year -- and has not succeeded in reducing 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1986 to 1991, imprisonment rose 51%, and violent crime increased 15%. 
"Clearly, no cause-and-effect relationship can be discerned here," says the 
report, "Americans Behind Bars." 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the "explosive growth" in the state's prison system "has been 
an expensive failure," charge the authors of the state sentencing report. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1970, the state's prison population has nearly tripled, while the rate 
of violent crime has more than doubled, Schiraldi said. State taxpayers are 
paying to imprison 75,000 nonviolent criminals, he said, at the expense of the 
state's higher education system. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last decade, we have added 19 new prisons and 26,000 corrections 
officers and lost 8,000 employees in higher education," he said. "Ten years 
ago, the higher-education budget was two and half times the corrections budget. 
This year, they are about even." 
</P>
<P>
 But others argue that crime could have been even worse had not more burglars, 
rapists and murderers been sentenced to long prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Prof. James Q. Wilson, an expert on crime, pointed out that rates for 
many crimes, such as robbery, have dropped since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "By 1986, there were 55,000 more robbers in prison than there had been in 
1974. Assume that each imprisoned robber would commit five such offenses per 
year if free on the street. This means that in 1986 there were 275,000 fewer 
robberies in America than there would have been had these 55,000 men been left 
on the street," Wilson writes in the September issue of "Commentary" magazine.

JUDGES REJECT BLACK-MAJORITY DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A divided federal appeals panel threw out state-drawn boundaries of a 
black-majority Georgia congressional district and placed elections there on 
hold so the judges can redraw the district themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel agreed with white voters who challenged the district's lines that it 
was gerrymandered to provide more black voters, in violation of the 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 "The assumption that the sole means of enhancing blacks' political influence 
is to pack them into such districts is unimaginative," Monday's 2-1 ruling 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges said no election can be held for the 11th District congressional 
seat of Rep. Cynthia McKinney until the boundaries are redrawn. They plan to 
consult state experts in remapping the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel's dissenter, Judge J. L. Edmondson of the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of 
Appeals, said he thinks the congressional district is constitutional and 
reapportionment should be left to the states. 
</P>
<P>
 State Atty. Gen. Michael Bowers said he will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to 
allow the election with the existing boundaries. A hearing was scheduled for 
Oct. 3 to consider suggestions for new district lines.

 Equipment problems beset the crew of the space shuttle Discovery as the six 
astronauts tried to beam climate data back to Earth. Despite the problems, most 
of the data from experiments was being collected as planned, and the National

technology research was not in jeopardy. Mission specialist Carl Meade tried 
unsuccessfully to fix a high-speed data recorder that has not worked since the

DEBATE RENEWED OVER FAST APPROVAL FOR AIDS DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Food and Drug Administration Monday reopened the contentious debate over 
the speedy approval of new AIDS drugs in response to a growing split within the 
usually unified network of AIDS patients and their advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 The activist community continues to support a 1992 decision by the agency to 
license therapies based on early signs -- known as "surrogate markers" -- that 
may predict, but do not prove, future clinical benefits. Some activists, 
however, have become increasingly unhappy over what they view as inadequate 
follow-through by drug companies and the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
 This has led to a lack of sufficient information about clinical benefits, 
"forcing people with HIV infection to make treatment decisions in the dark," 
said the Treatment Action Group, a New York-based activist organization that 
has spearheaded the effort to reopen the discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA's antiviral drugs advisory committee sponsored a meeting to listen to 
opinions on the subject but is not expected to make any immediate decisions or 
changes in the current policy. The panel is scheduled to make its views known 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Insisting that it still favors accelerated approval, Treatment Action Group 
nevertheless said that the agency "has not insisted on adequate and 
well-controlled confirmatory studies, and industry has not provided sufficient 
post-marketing information on whether accelerated-approved drugs actually 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 FDA spokesman Jim O'Hara said the agency "remains committed to accelerated 
approval but we've always realized that it could well be subject to mid-course 
correction." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, many speakers Monday -- including some who told poignant 
personal stories -- said they feared that the current discussion would endanger 
the accelerated approval policy, which they believe it is crucial to maintain. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Thomas McGee, a Los Angeles physician with an AIDS practice, complained 
that his patients were being "protected to death," when they were denied access 
to experimental therapies. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Delaney, founding director of Project Inform, said he thought it 
"unfortunate that this meeting has linked the discussion of how to get 
information from clinical trials with the issue of accelerated approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been preferable to raise the legitimate issue of getting better 
data as an independent concern, rather than making it a forum for debating the 
merits of accelerated approval," he added. "The issues can and do stand on 
their own."

YOUTHS IN NATIONAL SERVICE PLAN SWORN IN; AMERICORPS: YOUNG RECRUITS IN 
DOMESTIC VERSION OF PEACE CORPS WILL WORK IN SCHOOLS, HOSPITALS, ENVIRONMENT TO 
HELP PAY THEIR COLLEGE TUITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 President Clinton inaugurated his national service program for youth Monday, 
swearing in thousands of young recruits across the country who will work in 
schools and hospitals and help clean up the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, dubbed AmeriCorps, was approved by Congress last year to allow 
youths to earn college tuition or to pay off tuition loans by performing 
community service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Service is a spark to rekindle the spirit of democracy in an age of 
uncertainty," Clinton told hundreds of recruits gathered on the White House 
lawn in a ceremony beamed by satellite to thousands of others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every generation in our history has learned to take responsibility for our 
future and your generation is no exception." 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony, attended by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, Vice President Al 
Gore and leading congressional sponsors of the national service legislation, 
was delayed several hours and later moved to the front of the White House from 
the larger South Lawn because of the crash of a small aircraft on the grounds 
of the Executive Mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Fulfilling a key pledge of Clinton's presidential campaign, AmeriCorps is a 
domestic version of the Peace Corps, which was created by President John F. 
Kennedy, the chief executive whom Clinton most admires. 
</P>
<P>
 At Clinton's request, Congress approved $360 million to pay 20,000 Americans 
to work in the areas of health, education and human needs, public safety and 
the environment. Mostly in their late teens or early 20s, the recruits will be 
paid minimum wages and will receive health benefits and a $4,725 voucher for 
one year of work that can be used for college or vocational school tuition or 
to pay off a college loan. So that benefits may extend to as many as possible, 
recruits will be limited to two years' work. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing examples of the work that will be done, Clinton said that youths will 
be "saving babies in south Texas, walking police beats in Brooklyn, working on 
boats to reclaim the Chesapeake Bay . . . taking seniors safely to the doctor 
in St. Louis and helping children to read in Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
 For most, their work "will mark the beginning of a journey that will change 
their lives forever -- it will also change the life of this nation for many 
seasons to come," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the success of the initial program, the White House is asking 
Congress to appropriate $1.5 billion for a three-year program reaching 100,000 
persons. Several months of pilot projects already have been completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The President paid tribute to the spirit of volunteerism and community service 
that has strengthened the nation. "Every one of you represents the oldest and 
best of America's traditions," he said.

said.The man, believed to be in his late 30s, left a hot, dusty tent city at 
Guantanamo Bay Naval Base along with other refugees. He jumped and struck rocks 
on a beach, said Army Maj. Rick Thomas, spokesman for the task force running 
the refugee camps. The death was the first since the camps opened in late 
August.

cover up the alleged crime. Reynolds, a 42-year-old married father of three, 
has insisted that the woman, now 18, is a "liar," that he has signed affidavits 
from her recanting the allegations and that the prosecution is racially biased 
because he is black. Reynolds was running unopposed for a second term in a 
South Side district until the indictment last month.

BAN ON MALE NURSES TENDING PREGNANT WOMEN UPHELD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A San Bernardino hospital's refusal to allow male nurses to attend pregnant 
women during labor and delivery has been upheld by a state civil rights agency. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 3-1 ruling, the state Fair Employment and Housing Commission said an 
exemption from state job-discrimination laws was justified by the nurses' 
duties.Those include caring for partially nude patients and performing vaginal 
examinations and other invasive procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Assigning a male nurse to invade a female patient's privacy and perform 
intimate, invasive procedures when she is already enduring painful, exhausting 
labor is not conducive to establishing trust or relaxation for the female 
patient and instead could be expected to add to a patient's stress and 
anguish," the commission said in the ruling, which was released last week.

A STAR-CROSSED PAIR OF NATURAL BORN POLITICOS?; THEY WERE IN OPPOSING CAMPS IN 
1992. BUT STRATEGISTS -- AND WRITING PARTNERS -- MATALIN AND CARVILLE ARE NOW A 
TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They've been called the Romeo and Juliet of American politics, the Tracy and 
Hepburn, the Hatfield and McCoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnie and Clyde's more like it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they worked as hired guns for rival candidates in 1992, Mary Matalin 
and James Carville reveal themselves in their new book to be tactical soul 
mates, with a zeal for political combat matched only by their mutual affection. 
</P>
<P>
 "All's Fair: Love, War and Running for President," co-published with great 
fanfare by Random House and Simon & Schuster, doesn't break much new ground for 
those who followed the campaign or saw the Clinton-camp documentary "The War 
Room." 
</P>
<P>
 A meld of dueling diaries, put together by collaborator Peter Knobler, it's no 
heavy breather and it doesn't dish dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 But it does show that Carville, Bill Clinton's principal political strategist, 
and Matalin, political director for President Bush's re-election effort, seem 
to have been made for each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm running a campaign, I always say I want the people I'm running 
against to catch the clap and die," writes Carville cheerfully. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy is not killing us but he's a gnat, let's just take out the fly 
swatter and squash him," enthuses Matalin about Bush's early Republican 
challenger, Pat Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
 That shared ability to shoot from the lip has brought Carville post-election 
success as an after-dinner speaker and Matalin a devoted following for her 
quirky CNBC show, "Equal Time." Financial security for the first time in their 
rough-and-tumble lives has also brought them the wherewithal to finish a 
picturesque retreat in the Blue Ridge mountains an hour west of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewed on their deck there, as a cool breeze rustled the Gregorian wind 
chimes, they displayed a softer side and declared their days of mortal 
political combat over. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball Hall of Famer "Willie Stargell said (that) every time he got three 
hits, he would throw away the bat," said Carville in his distinctive Cajun 
drawl. "There are only so many hits in a bat. There's only so many campaigns in 
a person." 
</P>
<P>
 To run a campaign properly, he continued, "you have to be single or . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 As he searched for a phrase, Matalin, like good spouses everywhere, finished 
his sentence for him: ". . . have an awfully accommodating mate. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of that's a windy way of saying, we couldn't do it the way we did, but 
we're not out to pasture yet," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A steady couple for nearly four years -- with the exception of the 1992 
campaign -- and married for almost a year, Matalin and Carville exude a genuine 
affection for each other that belies the catty thought by some Washingtonians 
that their relationship is largely an act. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, what keeps coming through, in the flesh as in the book, is how very 
well-suited this supposed odd couple is. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are tall -- he's 6 feet 1, she's 5 feet 8 -- prefer blue jeans to blue 
suits and exude more sexual dynamism than usual in this uptight capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are products of close ethnic families -- his, Louisiana Cajun; hers, 
Chicago Irish-Croatian -- and were rambunctious, underachieving youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Both took seven years to get through college, found their calling relatively 
late in life and slogged their way to the pinnacle of politico heaven -- top 
jobs in a presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't set out to oppose each other. 
</P>
<P>
 It just worked out that way when Carville and his partner, Paul Begala, hot 
from masterminding the victory of Sen. Harris Wofford in Pennsylvania, got 
wooed by all the Democratic presidential hopefuls and picked Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Matalin, who got her start in political life as the rear end of an elephant in 
a Lincoln's Day parade, worked her way up in the Republican National Committee 
and finally earned a senior job in the Bush campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Matalin said in the interview, the fact that both she and Carville 
achieved such prominence simultaneously probably made their relationship 
succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "What would have wrecked the relationship would be if one was doing it and the 
other not," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, they no longer fight -- they tease. 
</P>
<P>
 They bicker amiably over what to put in a salad. He wants green pepper; she 
prefers onions. She wins. 
</P>
<P>
 They would very much like to have a child (she has had two miscarriages) and 
have tamed a manic schedule so that they can spend four-day weekends at their 
mountain home. 
</P>
<P>
 They will promote their book together in a well-paced 10-city campaign that 
begins this week in New York and ends at Thanksgiving on their first 
anniversary in the city where they wed, New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 Their unique relationship -- there have been other mixed political marriages 
in Washington but none so high-profile -- has spawned many a punch line by 
other products of the capital's political hothouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bedfellows make strange politicians," cracked Tom Korologos, a lobbyist here 
for over 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple bristled at some early reviews suggesting they pulled their punches 
in the book to avoid offending potential clients or guests on the Matalin show. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there was something I knew that was not favorable to the President, I 
wouldn't say it," Carville conceded. "They (Clinton and Bush) have been just 
gracious. What kind of people would we be if we would do anything to embarrass 
these people? We would be sorry scum." 
</P>
<P>
 One new nasty crack by Matalin, who became notorious for calling Clinton a 
"philandering, pot-smoking draft-dodger," is her comment that Bush White House 
Chief of Staff John Sununu "had the political acumen of a doorknob." 
</P>
<P>
 Bush, on the other hand, comes off as more of a regular guy than the awkward 
patrician he sometimes seemed. 
</P>
<P>
 Matalin, recalling a train trip through Ohio and Michigan in late September, 
1992, wrote that then-President Bush, who stayed on the platform of the caboose 
to wave at potential voters, called her back excitedly to tell her that an 
entire family had just stood along the tracks and mooned him! 
</P>
<P>
 "I was aghast, he was laughing away," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Such anecdotes aside, the book may well increase public cynicism, if that's 
possible, about the manipulative nature of political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Carville reveals how he "spun" the "quote sluts," the supposedly independent 
analysts whom reporters call for comments. 
</P>
<P>
 Matalin brags about her side's "coolest strategic fake-out," when they got 
Clinton to address a National Guard Assn. convention in Utah -- a state not 
important to his campaign -- because he was misled into thinking that Bush 
would attack his draft record there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a pretty business," Matalin said in the interview with a certain 
nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
 Those outside the Beltway may be surprised to learn that Carville and Matalin 
are not really very far apart politically. 
</P>
<P>
 How else could they both count among their friends such seemingly 
diametrically opposed figures as Ron Brown, the former Democratic Party 
chairman and now commerce secretary, and talk-show host Rush Limbaugh? 
</P>
<P>
 "Rush is a very personable guy," Carville said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for he and Matalin, "our principal differences are on some economic 
issues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 She trusts capitalists over bureaucrats. He has a more benign view of 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are populist and support legal abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mary's a little more liberal than she lets on," said Jane Wallace, her former 
co-host on "Equal Time" and now star of a show called "Under Scrutiny" on the 
new Fx cable network. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Carville, Wallace said, "He adores her. I think if Marilyn Monroe was 
reincarnated and walked naked through the room, he wouldn't notice." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Carville, whose unusual physiognomy inspired Matalin's favorite 
nickname for him -- Serpenthead -- said, "I'm always scared Mary is going to 
dump me because I'm not even a challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the essence is that we're exactly the same," Matalin said. "We are 
not control freaks but we both want to run things. That's been our adjustment 
-- who gets to run the show." 
</P>
<P>
 Both got defensive at comments from colleagues -- who in good Washington 
fashion asked to be quoted "on background," i.e. anonymously -- that they are 
"cashing in" on their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like that term, cash in ," Matalin fumed. "Like I'm 39 at the end of the 
Bush campaign, I have three months' savings in the bank, no job and no 
prospects. I meet him (she gestures toward Carville). At 47, he owns one thing 
-- a Schwinn. It's not even a 10-speed. And when someone breaks into his 
apartment, they steal a bottle of Wild Turkey 'cause that's the only thing 
there worth stealing." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, they have matching Jeeps, his and hers exercise machines in 
the loft bedroom and twin air rifles on the deck to shoot pellets at plastic 
juice bottles in a sport Carville calls "air-gun golf." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, they seem a little sheepish about the fuss, even if it is of their own 
making. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything I used to hate in candidates I've become," Carville said with a 
sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the public tires of their shtick and they have to find another way to 
make a living? 
</P>
<P>
 "When this era of our life is over and we're flat on our backs, we'll stand on 
a street corner with a sign that says, 'Will bicker for food,' " Carville 
said.;

A SHOT IN THE ARM; THAT'S WHAT KIDS NEED. MORE THAN A DOZEN SHOTS, IN FACT, 
BEFORE THEY ENTER KINDERGARTEN. BUT EVERYTHING FROM CONFUSION TO LACK OF 
INSURANCE TO INCONVENIENCE HELPS PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING.

 A new school year means more than buying new shoes and a fresh lunch box. 
Proving to school officials that a child has been immunized can send parents 
riffling through medical papers or madly dashing to the doctor's office with a 
totally bummed kid for last-minute shots. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the latest government advisory, children should receive 18 
vaccinations by the time they enter kindergarten -- although most schools don't 
require proof for some of the newer vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
 And, with the anticipated release of the chicken pox vaccine, which is 
awaiting final approval from the Food and Drug Administration, yet another 
immunization may be required in a vaccine regimen that, health experts agree, 
is already ripping at the seams. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the recent focus on vaccines, parents, too, remain confused about 
their responsibilities, leaving millions of children vulnerable to serious 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of concern about the complexity of the immunization schedule," 
says Dr. Ann Arvin, a Stanford University professor who helped test the 
forthcoming chicken pox vaccine. "It doesn't matter what wonderful vaccines we 
have if they cannot be given." 
</P>
<P>
 In some U.S. cities, up to half of all 2-year-olds are not vaccinated for 
potentially deadly illnesses. In one study of 60 large urban areas, an average 
of 44% of 2-year-olds were immunized. The vaccines protect children from 
diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), polio, measles, mumps, 
rubella, Haemophilus influenzae type b and hepatitis B. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton has made childhood immunization a priority, but the 
Administration has encountered massive logistic problems with its plan to 
distribute free vaccine for poor and uninsured children. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, while a free vaccine program would boost compliance rates, experts 
such as Arvin say the obstacles to getting children immunized are more complex. 
Besides cost, they include inconvenience, fear of side effects, and the size 
and complexity of the vaccination schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of these problems, health officials are exploring several ways to 
immunize more children, such as giving vaccines at schools and emergency rooms; 
better insurance coverage, and reminder systems such as phone calls or 
postcards to parents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While immunizations are often covered by HMOs and are free at public health 
clinics, the huge cost still has a lot to do with why kids aren't being 
vaccinated, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 In public health clinics, the cost to immunize a child to age 2 has risen 723% 
since 1981, state health officials report. But during the same period, funding 
to operate public clinics declined about 14%, with many clinics closing. 
Outreach programs, which located non-immunized children, were also scaled back. 
</P>
<P>
 Even families with health insurance face barriers because many private health 
plans do not cover immunizations. Parents who pay out-of-pocket for their 
children's vaccines at private doctors' offices can expect to spend at least 
$450 by the time the child is age 2. 
</P>
<P>
 In a study at public health clinics in Contra Costa County, where vaccines 
cost only a few dollars, researchers found that 24% of the families seeking 
immunizations for their children had private insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "People with private insurance had two reasons for using the clinics: Private 
insurance did not cover the cost of immunizations, or the families were 
confused about whether their insurance covered immunizations," says Dr. Tracy 
Lieu, the principal author from the University of California, San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Some insurers offer only partial coverage. For example, insurance carriers 
typically have been slow to cover the newer vaccines, such as hepatitis B. And 
there are questions as to whether insurers will cover the chicken pox vaccine 
-- called Varivax -- which will be one of the most expensive vaccines, costing 
about $35 for the vaccine alone compared to $5 to $15 for most other shots. Add 
the doctor's fees to that, and parents should expect to pay $50 or more for 
Varivax. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chicken pox is a pretty benign disease. Insurers have felt that it isn't high 
on the list of illnesses you need to prevent," Lieu says. "But if you take into 
account the work time parents lose when their child has chicken pox, we found 
for every $1 spent on the vaccine it would save $5.40 in lost work time." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents may lose work time caring for a sick child, but few apparently feel 
they can miss work to get their children vaccinated. 
</P>
<P>
 Inconvenience was found to be a major reason parents who have a good income, 
education level and insurance coverage did not get their children fully 
immunized, according to a study published in February in the Journal of the 
American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers gave questionnaires to 1,500 Johnson & Johnson employees who were 
eligible for one of three health benefit plans. The study found that only about 
half of the workers' children were up to date for immunizations. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked why, parents listed cost, the inability to get time off work, the 
wait to see the doctor, limited doctor's office hours and transportation 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Other studies show that parents are confused about which vaccines their kids 
should receive and when, Lieu says. 
</P>
<P>
 In her most recent study of 600 families in the Kaiser Permanente health-care 
system, Lieu found that a majority of families with 13-month-old babies did not 
know when the measles-mumps-rubella shot was due (12 to 15 months). 
</P>
<P>
 "Those were the families who were more likely to be late for the shot," Lieu 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Childhood immunization practices have become increasingly more complex since 
1987, when the Haemophilus influenza type b regimen was added. In 1992, the 
hepatitis B shots were added, and Varivax is waiting in the wings. Several 
other vaccines are in the final stages of research and could be added to the 
schedule later this decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of this flurry of changes, children in the same family sometimes end 
up on different immunization schedules. Moreover, several pharmaceutical 
companies make different vaccine preparations for the same disease, such as 
Hib, that require different regimens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is aware that parents and pediatricians are dealing with a huge 
number of vaccines to try and give. The numbers are astounding, even to me," 
Arvin says. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the two leading authorities on immunization -- the federal Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics -- 
differ slightly on what regimen each prefers. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts are under way between the two institutions to agree on a simpler, 
streamlined schedule that could be widely and easily publicized. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say parents fear the risks of vaccinations. I'm not sure the answer is 
so uncomplicated," Lieu says. "Perhaps we need to provide more information to 
parents so they know what vaccine is due when. The schedule is not that hard to 
follow, but someone needs to tell parents what is going on." 
</P>
<P>
 But parents' fears of side effects from the vaccines are another significant 
reason for noncompliance --  
</P>
<P>
 although a report released in March by the National Academy of Science shows 
the risks of any severe side effects from any of the immunizations is 
"extraordinarily low." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If 90% of the nation's 2-year-olds are to be fully vaccinated by 1996 -- a 
goal set by President Clinton -- the way children are immunized will have to 
undergo a transformation, vaccine experts agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the obvious need to make immunizations more affordable, more should be 
done to promote timely vaccinations, says Dr. Robert S. Daum, co-author of the 
Chicago study. Daum and his colleagues recommend a computerized, national 
tracking system so that unprotected children could be immunized any time they 
came in contact with the health-care system. 
</P>
<P>
 Another alternative is to press forward with research on combination vaccines 
-- which would consist of one shot that would cover five or more diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 But the research takes time and money, Arvin says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think combination vaccines are what we need to aim for," Arvin says. "I 
think it's feasible. But when you do combination vaccines, you have to test 
them just like any new vaccine. So it becomes a big logistical problem. For 
Parents 
</P>
<P>
 * Obtain a copy of the most updated vaccine schedule from a doctor, clinic or 
state or federal health department (A sample appears at right) 
</P>
<P>
 * Get an immunization card from a doctor and keep it in a safe place. 
</P>
<P>
 * Have a card updated by the doctor each time your child receives a vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you change doctors or move, get copies of you child's medical records. 
When to Get Those Vaccinations

'LEAR' PUTS SHAKESPEARE O.C. IN BLACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "King Lear," the tragedy that many consider the Mount Everest of Western 
theater, lifted Shakespeare Orange County to several new peaks of its own as 
the company concluded its 1994 season on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was our all-time highest-grossing, best-attended production," Thomas F. 
Bradac, the troupe's artistic director, said Monday, estimating attendance 
during the four-week engagement at 3,000, "significantly above" SOC's average 
of about 2,000 per show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lear," which starred Alan Mandell, grossed $45,000, topping the company's 
previous high of $40,000 set in 1993 with "Much Ado About Nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 And, the production's success put the troupe into the black for the first time 
in its three-year history. The gross was sufficient for the company to pay off 
an accumulated debt from its first two seasons. "We've paid our bills, and 
we're in good shape," Bradac said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look forward to modest growth within our budget," he added, noting that 
the company -- Orange County's only professional classical theater troupe -- 
will increase its season from two plays to three in 1995. The next season will 
include "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and "Richard III"; the third play has not 
been selected. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradac founded Shakespeare Orange County shortly after he was ousted by the 
board of the GroveShakespeare Festival, a classical troupe he founded in 1979. 
GroveShakespeare disbanded amid financial troubles and administrative disarray 
last year -- ironically, just days before its own production of "Lear," with 
Mandell in the lead, had been scheduled to open.

AN ICON WITH A FEW QUESTIONS; ROBERT REDFORD'S PERSONAL FILMS EXAMINE AMERICA'S 
MERCHANT MENTALITY

<P>
 In December of 1969, I walked along Fifth Avenue with Robert Redford amid a 
throng of holiday shoppers. No one seemed to recognize the 32-year-old actor, 
although he was starring in three major movies at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 He would never again be another face in the crowd, as he was obviously "on the 
threshold of that breakthrough which comes to few actors -- superstardom," I 
wrote in an article then. 
</P>
<P>
 Redford was smart, likable, funny, self-aware. It was easy to see why he had 
impressed Paul Newman, who generously shared the spotlight with him in "Butch 
Cassidy"; they were alike in many ways. And it didn't take a Sherlock Holmes to 
figure out what women saw in him. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, Redford was pragmatic. He was able to reconcile working within the 
Hollywood system on big-budget commercial pictures with his maverick need to 
also make personal, modest-budget movies that would stand up for the underdogs 
of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 In his passionate explanation of his first personal project, "Downhill Racer," 
which he co-produced and had to promote without help from its distributor, he 
told me back in '69: "We wanted to deal with the corruption of the merchants 
who exploit the athletes. The cruelty of the press. The athletes' 
one-dimensional existence. The hollowness of victory." 
</P>
<P>
 I recently heard an echo of the same tough-minded words from the director of 
"Quiz Show," when he was criticizing "the merchant mentality" that had 
corrupted television and destroyed Americans' confidence in it. Redford has 
stuck to his guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Redford, now 57 and a grandfather, remains a durable romantic icon in 
crowd-pleasers such as "Indecent Proposal" (1993). It is, however, as a 
director of modest-budget films about American life in which he demonstrates 
his continuing personal growth, by bringing to bear his painterly eye and his 
social conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting with his Oscar-winning directorial debut in 1980, "Ordinary People," 
through "The Milagro Beanfield War" (1988), "A River Runs Through It" (1992) 
and, now, the elegant "Quiz Show," Redford's films have become more technically 
accomplished and dramatically complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quiz Show," which opens Friday in Los Angeles, dramatizes the late '50s 
congressional investigation of NBC's rigged game show "Twenty-One." The film 
stars Ralph Fiennes as Charles Van Doren, an intellectual seduced by greed and 
the glamour of celebrity; Rob Morrow, as idealist / opportunist investigator 
Richard Goodwin, and John Turturro, as Herbert Stempel, a klutzy Everyman who 
blows the whistle on the corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The week has been grueling for Redford. He has spent the first few days at a 
Chicago hospital with his son, James, who "had a rough go" with a second liver 
transplant. David, a writer, lives in Denver with his wife and son. (Redford's 
eldest child, Shauna, an artist, just moved to New York from Vermont; his 
youngest, Amy, a recent graduate of San Francisco State, will be moving to New 
York this fall to pursue acting.)  
</P>
<P>
 He offers a quick checklist of what's on his plate: a Rob Reiner romantic 
comedy in which he'll play "a President who tries to find love in the White 
House," then "Up Close and Personal," about NBC anchorwoman Jessica Savitch. 
Then he'll direct "The Education of Little Tree," from the controversial book 
"about a half-breed young boy in the South in the '30s -- it's a wonderful 
story." 
</P>
<P>
 He then settles down to why and how he made "Quiz Show," a movie that is for 
him both the story of an era's end and a personal evocation of the excitement 
of New York in the late '50s, a time when he arrived there to take art and 
acting classes. "I'll never forget this city at that time, because it was when 
I began my life," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He has vivid memories of watching Van Doren on "Twenty-One," which was 
broadcast from NBC's studios at Rockefeller Center, recalling "this mixed 
feeling, almost being angry that I was sucked into it. Not able to resist it. 
Yet thinking something was funny about it: 'How can anybody answer that many 
questions that well?' And, 'That guy looks like he's acting to me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But he figured Van Doren for a stiff trying to spice up his performance, not a 
cheat. Redford said he was as incredulous and disillusioned as everyone else 
when Van Doren confessed that his performance was a sham engineered by the 
show's producers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until then," recalls Redford, "we still trusted what we saw on TV. I did. I 
think that quiz show scandal was really the first in a series of scandals . . . 
that have left us numbed, unsure of what or who to believe." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Redford read a rough draft of Paul Attanasio's screenplay for 
"Quiz Show," inspired by a chapter in Richard N. Goodwin's 1988 book, 
"Remembering America: A Voice From the Sixties." Redford had just finished "A 
River Runs Through It," whose directorial style was dictated by the rhythms of 
nature. "I was looking for something edgier, faster-paced, urban, where I could 
move the camera more." 
</P>
<P>
 After some false starts when the film languished briefly at TriStar, the 
project ended up at Disney. With Disney's backing, "I was able to make an 
independent film for $20 million," says Redford. "I filmed in New York for 62 
days, which is a comparatively short shooting schedule. It was so much fun. 
Every morning was a thrill to go to work. I couldn't wait to get in the set. 
New issues kept bubbling out as I was filming." 
</P>
<P>
 After an extensive search, two British actors, Paul Scofield and Fiennes, were 
chosen to play real-life American father and son Mark and Charles Van Doren. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could not find the combination of elements I was looking for in Charles Van 
Doren" among the American actors he tested, he says -- "a shell of something 
patrician . . . a way of speaking and behaving that is slightly peremptory . . 
. an erudition and sharp intellect . . . a certain Aryan charm . . . and most 
important, a shadow, a haunted look around the eyes suggesting a demon within." 
</P>
<P>
 Redford originally asked Paul Newman to play Van Doren's father, the poet and 
Columbia professor. Newman declined. He then settled upon Scofield, who brings 
to the role a dignity and paternal warmth. 
</P>
<P>
 Redford thinks his having to cast British actors to play well-bred American 
characters -- as Martin Scorsese did casting Daniel Day-Lewis as the 
upper-class 19th-Century New Yorker in "The Age of Innocence" -- is a sign of 
"the illiteracy that has overtaken our industry. We work in such an 
action-oriented, high-tech mode. 
</P>
<P>
 "So one of the joys for me about this movie is . . . having words to work with 
almost as a musical instrument. I saw staging the scenes as dance. The way the 
two quiz show producers moved around in their office and always settled on the 
desk, for instance, was choreographed like Hekyll and Jekyll." 
</P>
<P>
 Redford also enjoyed giving fellow director Scorsese acting tips for his cameo 
as the imperious quiz show sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Marty, look, you're a high-wired guy. How would you feel about 
playing a guy who's so totally comfortable with himself, so comfortable with 
all the marbles being in his basket that he doesn't have to worry about 
anything? Just play this (being grilled by a relentless congressional 
investigator) as relaxed and friendly and warm as you possibly can. So 
everything gets slow. We don't have to play anything ominous.' He loved that 
idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Redford hopes that even the most outrageous behavior by "Twenty-One's" 
producers, sponsors, host and network president has an inner logic that 
prevents them from becoming caricatures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every character has to be given a moment," he says, "no matter how villainous 
their activities are, where we say, 'I get it. I understand why they're that 
way.' We even gave them that line at the end of the movie, when the producer is 
asked, 'So you don't think you did anything wrong?' And he says, 'Look at it 
this way: The producers made out, the sponsor made out, the public was 
entertained. Who got hurt?' 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a real valid argument, from the merchant point of view. But there used 
to be a thing called ethics. And there was a thing called shame. It doesn't 
exist anymore, because corruption has become a way of life."

'BOLD' STAR'S A ONE-MAN 'AGENCY'; JUST WHEN JEFF TRACHTA'S SOAP ROLE SEEMED TO 
BE DIMINISHING, HE FOUND OPTIONS. NOW HE HAS A MANAGER, A SITCOM DEVELOPMENT 
DEAL AND A THIRD MUSIC VIDEO PLANNED.

 Jeff Trachta, who for five years has played fashion scion Thorne Forrester on 
the CBS daytime drama "The Bold and the Beautiful," is accustomed to singing in 
concerts for up to 30,000 fans in Europe, where the soap is a huge hit. But it 
took his performance in a one-man show at a 99-seat theater in West Hollywood 
to make the local entertainment community sit up and take notice. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past few weeks, Trachta has been spending Wednesday nights at the 
Coast Playhouse emoting in "Agency," a comedy-drama that follows the life of an 
actor, Joel Krane, for 10 years as he moves from struggling wanna-be to 
disillusioned television star. Trachta portrays more than two dozen characters, 
male and female, most denizens of the Los Angeles talent agency that is the 
show's primary setting. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the initially wide-eyed, sincere Krane, for instance, there is the 
gravelly voiced Lydia Sanders, the agency's veteran 
receptionist-cum-housemother. Putting in appearances are such clients as 
fictional actor Wesley Addison, a seasoned pro obsessed with having a lifelong 
good hair day; the Fifth Dimension's Billy Davis Jr. and Charles Nelson Reilly. 
</P>
<P>
 Trachta moves seamlessly from one to another, sort of a sane "Sybil." He also 
sings and does dead-on impersonations of Edith and Archie Bunker, Pee-wee 
Herman and Ronald Reagan. (The play continues on Wednesdays indefinitely.) 
</P>
<P>
 His efforts have been rewarded handsomely. Manager Buddy Morra, who represents 
the likes of Robin Williams and Billy Crystal, signed him. And while the play 
was being written, Trachta performed it for the president of Castle Rock 
Television, the production company behind "Seinfeld." He was offered a sitcom 
development deal on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for someone who has had the acting bug since he played Papa Bunny in a 
third-grade Easter pageant, and who years later, as a 6-foot-3 ex-cast member 
of the soap "Loving," had to earn his living by cleaning ovens for a company 
called the Little Elves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been rehearsing this show for over 33 years now -- in my living room, 
for friends, in the makeup room at 'The Bold and Beautiful,' " says Trachta, in 
his CBS dressing room after the day's taping, of the gift for vocal impressions 
cultivated as a youngster in his native New York City. "Being the clown -- 
because Thorne is so serious -- people had been telling me to do a one-man 
show." 
</P>
<P>
 One of those people, actor-producer-coach Jeffrey Marcus, put Trachta in touch 
with Charles Randolph-Wright, director and co-author of the long-running 
musical "The Diva Is Dismissed," who conceived the show's premise upon watching 
a videotape of Trachta's characters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tease Jeff now, and say, 'I thought you were just another vacuous soap 
star,' " Randolph-Wright says. "Here's someone who's diametrically opposed in 
his look -- that leading-man look -- to what he actually does. I realized how 
incredible it would be to take that and harness it in a real context." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the Northridge earthquake the morning after their first meeting did not 
deter the two. They spent the next three weeks plumbing Trachta's life for 
fodder to be fictionalized, ultimately sharing co-writing credit. It was 
through Randolph-Wright's contacts that Trachta found himself in the office of 
Castle Rock Television President Glenn Padnick. 
</P>
<P>
 Padnick's immediate offer of a development deal, targeted for the 1995-96 
season -- "if I was interested," Trachta says with a wry smile -- was as ironic 
as it was welcome: Only days earlier, the actor had been notified that his 
status as a "contract" player on "The Bold and the Beautiful" was being reduced 
to "recurring" for story-line purposes. His soap role has since been 
rejuvenated -- but Trachta has rejected a request to go back on contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to keep all my options open at this time," he says. "I've assured them 
I will play Thorne as long as I can. I love it, and I love the people here. The 
soap has been an incredible gift in my life. It has opened so many doors." 
</P>
<P>
 One door has led to a real-life singing career with cast-mate Bobbie Eakes, 
who plays his ex-wife and singing partner Macy. Having performed in all 50 
states and throughout Europe, the duo will soon make their third music video 
and have released a best-selling CD in the Netherlands, to be distributed in 
this country by the end of the year; Trachta will spend his 34th birthday in 
October performing a sold-out concert for 10,000 people in Rotterdam. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought I'd do any of this," he says with the same open sincerity of 
the early Joel Krane. "I'd never even been on a plane till I came here at 21, 
from New York. I was thrilled just to have a $99- ticket."

MOCA FACILITY DELAYS REOPENING; ART: TEMPORARY CONTEMPORARY WILL STAY SHUT 
UNTIL NEXT AUGUST. MUSEUM OFFICIAL DENIES CLOSING WAS PROLONGED TO SAVE MONEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The reopening of the Temporary Contemporary, the Museum of Contemporary Art's 
popular Little Tokyo annex that had been projected to reopen this fall, has 
been pushed back a year to August, 1995, museum officials will announce today, 
bringing the total time behind sealed doors to three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The multidisciplinary showcase for arts on the cutting edge was closed in 
June, 1992, to accommodate construction of the adjacent First Street North 
project, a city-owned office, housing and retail complex. The museum closed 
after "Helter Skelter: L.A. Art in the 1990s," because the facility expected 
its utilities to be cut off and parking garage excavation begun around the 
annex, but rezoning held up the work, and with the drop in the real estate 
market and the change in administration, First Street North was sent back to 
city staff to assess less costly options. The project is expected to go before 
the City Council later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 MOCA officials, under pressure from trustees, have decided not to wait for 
First Street to be resolved before reopening. 
</P>
<P>
 A source close to the museum said that while First Street prompted the 
Temporary Contemporary's closing in the first place, MOCA officials kept it 
closed longer than might have been needed to save money. The facility costs 
about $500,000 a year to operate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a lot of money saved by having it closed," the source said. 
"The tragedy is the space has been unused for all that time, and so much of the 
permanent collection is unseen." 
</P>
<P>
 MOCA Director Richard Koshalek denied that the museum's doors stayed shut 
because of money. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at the museum's audited statements, until we shut down the 
Temporary Contemporary we never had a deficit," he said. "We didn't shut it 
down for financial reasons, but because the project was going to move ahead. 
There was a cost difference in closing the TC, there's no way of denying that, 
but it's not that significant." 
</P>
<P>
 Koshalek told The Times last January that the Temporary Contemporary would 
reopen this fall if First Street were not approved. He now admits that some 
museum trustees "feel we waited too long to reopen." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the reopening was delayed until next year to allow time to raise 
funds; produce a catalogue for "1965-1975: Reconsidering the Object of Art," a 
multidisciplinary history of Conceptual art that opens at the space in October, 
1995; accommodate the schedules of the 50 artists in that show, and prepare the 
facility for reopening.  
</P>
<P>
 The Temporary Contemporary needs to be cleaned and repainted, and its doors 
need to be unsealed, the security and lighting systems upgraded and the ticket 
booth moved. The bookstore will also be expanded with outside access so it can 
remain open when the museum is closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The reopening "didn't have to be that far off, but we felt it's more 
appropriate to open in the fall than the summer," Koshalek said. "The art 
season begins in the fall." 
</P>
<P>
 The facility will reopen Aug. 30, with "Action/Occupation," a program of works 
by New York-based choreographer Elizabeth Streb and her company Ringside. 
Performances will run until Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 For the program, MOCA commissioned Streb to create a new work, "Echo," which 
will use the Temporary Contemporary's interior as an art object along with a 
20-foot wall of sheet metal. The company will also perform other works by Streb 
that use the skylights and airspaces of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's like a living sculpture," said MOCA curator Julie Lazar. "She takes her 
cues from architects and designers." 
</P>
<P>
 Streb's commission evokes memories of the Temporary Contemporary's opening in 
1983, when Lucinda Childs choreographed a work that also bowed to the 
architecture of the Frank Gehry-renovated building. Both choreographers were 
chosen because they reflect the space's interdisciplinary spirit, Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 "1965-1975: Reconsidering the Object of Art" will run from Oct. 8, 1995, 
through Jan. 7, 1996, returning the Temporary Contemporary to full exhibition 
programming.

OCPS WILL APPEAL LOWER STATE GRANT; FUNDING: ARTS COUNCIL CONCERN ABOUT 
SALARIES, DIVERSITY ARE MISPLACED, DIRECTOR SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Orange County Philharmonic Society will appeal the state arts council's 
decision to reduce the society's 1994-95 grant by more than one-third, society 
director Dean Corey said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A council program manager said last week that the grant was lowered to $20,687 
from $33,005 last year because the California Arts Council is concerned that 
the society's administrative salaries are increasing while the salaries it pays 
artists are declining.Further concerns, the program manager said, were a lack 
of cultural diversity among the group's board members, and what the council 
considers insufficient board involvement in outreach programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Corey said Monday that the administrative "salaries probably went up a little, 
but not significantly." 
</P>
<P>
 On the grant application, he said, "I consolidated all the salaries, which 
makes it look like they took a big leap. Previously, they had been scattered 
around -- in the marketing budget, the development budget, the administrative 
budget and the education budget. . . . Evidently, we didn't footnote that 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other issues, we don't have enough of a diverse representation on 
board membership, but we certainly are diverse in the people we serve, probably 
more than any other Orange County arts group." 
</P>
<P>
 Corey said he will file the appeal after he receives the arts council's 
written notification of its action, in about three weeks.

A COUPLE OF MISCONCEIVED NOTIONS; THE GREATEST ILLUSION MAY BE A PERCEPTION 
THAT, OF THE PARTNERS, MR. MCCLOSKEY WAS THE BETTER PAINTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A still life of tissue-paper-wrapped oranges by William McCloskey fetched 
$341,000 at an auction two years ago, and other works by the 
turn-of-the-century painter also have fetched six figures. Paintings by 
McCloskey's wife, Alberta, for the most part have never made it to auction. 
</P>
<P>
 No biggie, except that, according to Nancy Dustin Wall Moure, guest curator of 
"Partners in Illusion: William and Alberta Binford McCloskey," Alberta was the 
better painter. The exhibition opens todayat the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art 
in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alberta could handle the illusionism of a cloisonne vase, and tremendously 
intricate flowers," Moure said. "William to my knowledge couldn't handle that. 
Or at least didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "When William did a still life, it was something simple and round, like a 
lemon or an orange or an apple," Moure said. "He would paint a see-through 
glass bowl or tissue paper, but his edges were soft. Compared to her stuff, his 
was a semi-out-of-focus situation." 
</P>
<P>
 His edges were indeed soft: After the couple's breakup in 1898, William had a 
breakdown and spent several years recuperating before resuming his career 
alone. The emphasis at the Bowers exhibition (which runs concurrently with 
"Easels in the Arroyos: Plein Air Paintings from the Permanent Collection") is 
on still lifes and genre paintings the McCloskeys did while married. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowers has a huge collection of California paintings that generally are not 
shown because the institution has changed its focus to the art of indigenous 
peoples. Feeling that many of these paintings nevertheless deserve to be seen, 
the museum contacted Moure. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only by sifting through turn-of-the-century newspapers that Moure was 
able to glean any significant information about the McCloskeys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until now nothing has been known about them," Moure said. "And I mean 
nothing. People have reproduced an isolated picture, but were unable to say 
anything about the couple. Using the articles that I found, I was able to 
reconstruct a biography." 
</P>
<P>
 The McCloskeys lived mostly in California and New York, but also traveled a 
great deal. Alberta died in 1911 in Jamaica, where she'd gone for health 
reasons. William spent his last 15 years with his daughter and her husband at a 
campground they owned in Oregon, but died in 1941, not long after moving to 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowers' collection is based on the painters' own "demo" pieces. The McCloskeys 
earned their primary income from portraits they painted jointly, but those were 
commissioned works, and the museum owns no examples. The show does include a 
handful of portraits painted by William alone in Los Angeles after 1915. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from the portraits Moure has seen, she said: "It was probably Alberta 
who was able to infuse the spirit, the life behind the face, in the portraits 
that the two did together. The portraits William did later are kind of tepid. 
They don't have that bright liveliness." 
</P>
<P>
 Moure selected William's best work, however, and based upon what's being shown 
at Bowers, her assessments seem more a case of comparing oranges and 
tangerines: Alberta's superior technical prowess is clearly displayed in her 
"Oranges in Tissue with Vase," for instance, which is exhibited opposite a 
William untitled still life with tangerines. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether that makes Alberta the superior artist is the kind of question Moure 
hopes will now be explored more seriously than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the (old) newspaper reviews, you have this 'bright little woman with 
marvelous still lifes,' yet William would always get the main attention," Moure 
said. "Now art history is taking another swing, especially with women artists 
of the West. But frankly, since the discovery of paper-wrapped oranges in art 
books of the 1970s, everything advertised has been for William. No dealer has 
recognized that . . . Alberta even painted. And they won't until this show." 
</P>
<P>
 Beside the Bowers' 40 McCloskey paintings, as few as 20 others may to exist; 
half of those 20 are the paper-wrapped oranges for which the McCloskeys are 
best known, and which have commanded the highest prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those prices are irrational given the rest of the still lifes (on the 
market)," Moure noted. "Part of it is due to the mystique -- that nothing is 
known about the couple -- part is due to the paintings' rarity. 
</P>

 "This show is not going to get national coverage," she continued, "but I've 
written an article on the McCloskeys, and when that appears, some of that 
mystique is going to drop away. People are also going to realize Alberta is 
better. What I think you'll see, however, is a drop in William's prices, rather 
than an increase in Alberta's. That's my guess."

 Train service -- A story Saturday on Amtrak service in Camarillo may have been 
unclear. Amtrak service will begin Oct. 30, without station improvements that 
Amtrak had requested from the city. The improvements have been made 
unnecessary, due to changes in scheduling for Metrolink trains, which use the 
same station, according to a Ventura County Transportation Commission 
spokesman.
