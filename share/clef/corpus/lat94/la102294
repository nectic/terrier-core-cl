 REDWOOD CHRISTMAS? It's hard to get too much California sunshine -- unless 
you're a Christmas tree. The stately 20-foot spruce in Crown Valley Community 
Park, which Laguna Niguel residents have lit and decorated for six years, has 
died. Officials say its natural habitat was snow and cold -- it just had too 
much sunshine. . . . Laguna Niguel now has its eye on an 18-foot coast redwood, 
and hopes some organization will come forward to buy and install it in time for 
a late November decoration ceremony.

 FOND REMEMBRANCE: Actor Burt Lancaster, who died Friday, is remembered fondly 
at the Los Alamitos Center. He stayed there for two weeks in 1990 after 
suffering a debilitating stroke while visiting in that city. . . . Lancaster 
received so many flowers he had them distributed to other patients. Says its 
spokeswoman Kay Koford: "He was very gracious. His family was wonderful; they 
kept a low profile, but were here night and day."

 MODEL MENTOR: Larry Paul hires lots of people in his county job in charge of 
harbors, beaches, and trails. Most of them lately happen to be women. . . . 
"I'm not gender focused, but some people with great ideas just need someone to 
give them an opportunity," says Paul. Someone has noticed his efforts. The 
county this week awarded Paul with its "Mentor Award," an adjunct to its Women 
of Achievement awards series. . . . Adds Paul: "I was surprised, getting an 
award just for doing what it is you're supposed to do."

 WIN BY DESIGN: If you're in the building management business, the Oscars, 
Emmys or Grammys don't have near the impact as the annual Tobys. That's "The 
Office Building of the Year" award from the local building and managers 
association. . . . Recent winners: Lakeshore Towers and Palm Court, both in 
Irvine, and 3 Imperial Promenade at MacArthur Place in Santa Ana. Says 
Lakeshore Towers manager Diane Scott: "Our job is not just to get tenants, but 
to keep them happy. Our volleyball tournaments help."

LILLY SHAPELL; HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR, AUTHOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lilly Shapell, a survivor of Nazi concentration camps who with her husband, 
Nathan -- also a camp prisoner -- helped document the ordeal in their 1974 book 
"Witness to the Truth," died Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 A family spokesman said Mrs. Shapell was 75 and died in a Los Angeles hospital 
after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage. 
</P>
<P>
 A master of five languages, Mrs. Shapell was denied a doctorate degree from 
the University of Vienna when the Nazis invaded Austria. But in 1989, she 
received an honorary doctorate from Bar-Ilan University in Israel, one of the 
Shapells' many philanthropies. 
</P>
<P>
 After fleeing Vienna for Budapest, Hungary, she was sent to Auschwitz, but 
emerged as one of the rare survivors. She was an interpreter at some of the war 
crimes trials and met her future husband in Budapest. Their book developed from 
interviewing and helping many fellow Holocaust refugees rebuild their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1951, the Shapells came to the United States, where Nathan began a 
development empire that was responsible for the construction of tens of 
thousands of California homes. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her work on behalf of Israel and the United Jewish Fund, Mrs. 
Shapell served on the board of the state Nursing Home Examiners. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Vera, and three 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Services are scheduled for Sunday at 2 p.m. at Hillside Memorial Park.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alan Cooke, a British-born director whose credits ranged from television's 
"Lou Grant" to tours of U.S. college campuses presenting "King Lear," is dead 
of liver failure caused by hepatitis. 
</P>
<P>
 A family spokesman said this week he was 68 and died in Los Angeles on Oct. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in London, Cooke began directing while a he was member of the Coldstream 
Guards stationed in Palestine at the end of World War II. It was a production 
of Bernard Shaw's "Arms and the Man." Thereafter, his eclectic tastes led him 
to the works of Shakespeare, Ben Jonson and the new medium of live television. 
</P>
<P>
 He also staged the works of Evelyn Waugh, Anton Chekhov, Arthur Miller and 
T.S. Eliot. 
</P>
<P>
 In Britain for Thames Television, he produced and directed a 13-part series on 
the short stories of Graham Greene. His other work in England involved 
miniseries about Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine and the life and work of 
author Katherine Mansfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooke returned to the United States in 1979, directing episodes of "Lou 
Grant," "Quincy," "Matlock," "Hart to Hart," "Father Dowling Mysteries" and 
many others. 
</P>
<P>
 His stage efforts in Los Angeles brought Dramalogue Critics' Awards for "The 
Birthday Party," "Rocket to the Moon" and "Summer and Smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include his wife, Eleanor, a daughter, son and brother.

PROP. 187 SPARKS MORE HIGH SCHOOL WALKOUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMELYN CRUZ LAT and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The wave of high school walkouts in protest of Proposition 187 continued 
throughout Southern California on Friday and in one case the demonstrations 
turned turbulent, as sheriff's deputies fired two non-lethal rubber grenades to 
disperse a crowd of protesters in Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second consecutive Friday marked by anti-Proposition 187 
demonstrations by students. A week before, about 1,500 students from junior and 
senior high schools in Los Angeles and several of its southeastern suburbs left 
their classrooms to demonstrate against the controversial proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 In Costa Mesa, about 100 students walked out of Estancia High School about 1 
p.m. Friday and marched down the street shouting, "Viva la raza!" and "Mexico, 
Mexico, Mexico!" 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 Oxnard students walked out of Rio Mesa High School on Friday morning 
and marched several miles toward Oxnard High School in protest of the 
proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure's best-known provisions would bar illegal immigrants from public 
schooling, non-emergency health care and social services. Proponents say the 
measure would help curb continuing, large-scale illegal immigration. Opponents 
consider the measure to be poorly drafted and a xenophobic invitation to harass 
the foreign-born. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies fired "stingball" grenades shortly before 4 p.m. to disperse a crowd 
of 450 to 500 people who gathered at Hunsaker Avenue and Alondra Boulevard in 
Paramount, said Sheriff's Sgt. Ron Spear. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured by the stingballs -- explosive devices that emit rubber 
pellets, Spear said -- and there were no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Students from Paramount walked out of classes shortly after 9 a.m., deputies 
said, and went to Dominguez High School, about two miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez Principal Fred Easter said that the march was peaceful and that 
deputies had the protesters under surveillance. The marchers then walked from 
the Dominguez campus to Jordan High School in Long Beach, and returned to 
Dominguez at lunchtime, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities blocked the intersection of Hunsaker and Alondra near the 
Dominguez campus, but the students were not cooperative when police attempted 
to disperse them, Easter said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that most of the demonstrators were from Paramount High but that some 
Dominguez students were involved. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstration began with about 50 students, Spear said, but by 3:45 p.m. 
the march had picked up another 400 students and adults. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, school district officials reported anti-Proposition 187 
walkouts at four high schools Friday. During peaceful demonstrations, students 
briefly left their classes in the morning at El Camino Real in Woodland Hills 
and Jordan in Watts. Noontime walkouts occurred at Palisades in Pacific 
Palisades and at Lincoln in Lincoln Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 In Costa Mesa, Estancia High junior Carlos Hernandez said, "I think 
(Proposition 187) is just an excuse to get us (Latinos) out of here." 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Alvarado, a drug counselor at the school who tried unsuccessfully to 
persuade students not to leave, said he nevertheless supported their protest. 
If Proposition 187 passes, he said, "It's just going to explode. . . . You're 
targeting the kids as a vehicle to get to a bigger problem, and that's not 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 Students in Oxnard marched a block from Oxnard High before they were stopped 
by police. They then retreated to Plaza Park, where police put them on school 
buses that took them home. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Union High School District officials, worried that students at Oxnard 
High would join the march, asked police to detain the protesters before they 
reached school grounds.  
</P>
<P>
 The march was generally peaceful, police said, although a few students threw 
rocks at passing cars, and many ripped election signs from the streets as they 
walked by, converting them into anti-Prop. 187 posters. 
</P>
<P>
 Too young to vote, the students said they were expressing their opinion on the 
controversial ballot measure the only way they could. Most of the protesters 
were Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our friends and family are undocumented people," said 15-year-old 
Rosie Collazo, as she marched down Central Avenue. "Maybe we're a bunch of high 
school students, but we know what we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Both high schools are part of the Oxnard Union High School District, which is 
55% Latino.

THE JUDGE'S WISE CHANGE OF MIND; CLOSING DOORS ONLY ADDS TO THE DIFFICULTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lance A. Ito, the Los Angeles Superior Court judge conducting the O. J. 
Simpson case, has rescinded his controversial order closing the doors to the 
press and public and will thus allow jury questioning to proceed apace as it 
should: in the full light of day. Judge Ito's reversal was wise and necessary, 
coming Friday before an appeals court probably would have overturned the order 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 The order was misconceived and unconstitutional. According to a court 
spokesman, Ito intended to exclude the press and public from only individual 
questioning of 80 or so prospective jurors about their exposure to the news 
media, including a gossipy new book about Nicole Brown Simpson that greatly 
irritated the judge and Simpson's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 ANY IS TOO MUCH: However limited the closure, the net effect would have been 
to deprive the public of an important portion of the pretrial proceedings. And 
whatever the judge's intentions, that would have been a violation of the First 
Amendment and of controlling case law. As the Supreme Court put it in Elrod vs. 
Burns (1976), the "loss of First Amendment freedoms, even for minimal periods 
of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury." 
</P>
<P>
 Barring a showing of fact that out-of-court reporting has in any way affected 
the jury selection process -- and there has been no such showing -- the judge's 
order must be seen as just plain wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 More is at stake here than the obvious self-interest of the news media in 
being able to report stories that interest people. A major purpose of the First 
Amendment is to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs. By 
offering such protection, the First Amendment serves to ensure that the 
citizens are effectively informed and have the information necessary to 
understand government processes. A murder trial is just such an important 
government process; it is vital that the public observe jury selection to be 
open and fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito is absolutely right in demanding that Simpson get a fair trial in this 
highly publicized murder case. And he may sincerely believe that his 
unquestionably difficult task is made no easier when tabloid newspapers, 
tabloid-style television shows and other down-market media play up the trivial 
aspects of the Simpson case, often in lurid detail, as does the new book on 
Nicole Simpson. Alas, Ito's reaction to publicity about that book gave it even 
more prominence than it might otherwise have had. 
</P>
<P>
 FUTILE ENDEAVOR: Moreover, in our view, Ito sometimes allows himself to get 
sidetracked by things he cannot and should not try to control. Yes, he needs to 
control what goes on in the courtroom, and he of course must be concerned with 
keeping jurors away from prejudicial media reports. But it is futile for him to 
preoccupy himself with how the news media are reporting the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first sensational trial with massive news coverage. Jurors in 
other highly publicized trials have managed to make decisions based on the 
evidence rather than the publicity. Let's keep that in mind.

DMV TAKES A BAD DETOUR; AFTER FATAL ACCIDENT, PROGRAM THAT EXEMPTED TICKETED 
DRIVERS WILL BE ENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 20 years, the California Department of Motor Vehicles operated a 
little-known program in which some errant drivers who racked up three 
violations within a year were not warned their licenses would be suspended if 
they acquired a fourth. The intent was to compare their driving behavior with 
that of drivers who did receive warnings. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday the department announced it will end the program in December, 
prodded by two state legislators, Sen. Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco) and 
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Panorama City). Unfortunately, it required a 
tragedy to prompt the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Sunday a pickup truck in the rural Orange County community of Silverado 
Canyon struck three people, killing one and injuring the other two. Police said 
the truck's driver and the driver of an automobile might have been racing. Both 
were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and felony driving under the 
influence. 
</P>
<P>
 The license of the truck's operator would have been suspended had he not been 
randomly selected to be part of the Negligent Operator Treatment Evaluation 
System (NOTES). When a computer registered his second speeding conviction 
within a year it assigned him to the control group. Two other speeding tickets 
subsequently logged into DMV records were excluded from the NOTES files because 
of the way the computer was programmed, DMV officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 For years the DMV has said that its warnings of imminent license suspensions 
surely prevent accidents. In this case, the driver's suspension probably would 
have been up by the time the accident occurred, but it is fair to presume that 
some of the drivers in the NOTES study would have lightened up on the 
accelerator after receiving a warning and some who had accidents might have 
lost their driving privileges before those accidents occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who did not receive warnings might have believed they beat the system. 
Certainly 20 years was much too long for this program to last, and it is not 
clear what if anything was learned from it, other than that it was a bad idea.

CHEAP GUNS, VERY COSTLY RESULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gun advocates are right about one thing: A statewide ban in California on the 
sale of cheap, easily hidden "Saturday night specials" would not end handgun 
violence. No one measure by a single state can dissolve a nationwide problem. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a state ban on these guns, which serve no legitimate sporting 
purpose, would surely restore a great measure of sanity to our streets, schools 
and lives. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why thoughtful leaders are embracing a ban such as those already in 
place in Maryland, South Carolina and parts of Illinois. The latest to do so 
include Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams, Sheriff Sherman Block and 
Assemblyman Louis Caldera (D-Los Angeles). The three spoke this week at a 
hearing of Caldera's Assembly Select Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The need is tragically obvious. A study released the day before Caldera's 
hearing was held found that 47,888 Californians were gunshot victims last year. 
The number of Californians killed by guns jumped a sickening 30% between 1989 
and 1993, higher than the national average. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no wonder that the problem is worse here; Southern California is heaven 
for the manufacture of the cheap handguns responsible for the vast majority of 
these gun deaths. A recent study found that seven of the region's gun 
manufacturers churned out more than 80% of all small-caliber guns made in the 
entire country during 1992. According to another study, .25-caliber guns made 
by one Southern California company alone were the weapons most frequently 
recovered at crime scenes by the LAPD in 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the guns may be cheap -- as low as $25 -- their ready availability 
has proven exceedingly expensive. Firearms-related violence for California 
alone is now estimated to cost more than $18 billion a year. More than $1.1 
billion of that is in medical care, most of it borne by the taxpayer; the rest 
involves lost income, productivity and quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Enough. These instruments of mayhem and human destruction must go.

GAS TAX BALLOT MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Prop. 185: Too Ambitious, Too Costly," editorial, Oct. 17: 
</P>
<P>
 Your editorial in opposition to Proposition 185 (calling for a 4% sales tax on 
gasoline, with revenues dedicated to a variety of mandated transportation 
projects) on the November ballot comes as a surprise, especially in light of 
your argument. Perhaps you do not fully understand the elements of the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 185 would provide a constant source of funding for a serious 
element of California's economic infrastructure which has had difficulty 
keeping up with demand. The overbuilding of highways has caused enormous 
problems that would be at least partially addressed by allowing the problem to 
help fund the solution. Why be opposed to that? 
</P>
<P>
 Funding for earthquake safety of bridges is already partially in place so that 
this would merely provide needed additional resources on a pay-as-you-go basis. 
Is selling more bonds a better idea? 
</P>
<P>
 Your editorial acknowledges the "ban" on magnetic levitation technology. This 
is so that billions won't be wasted on a new technology that has never been 
used before and which has serious problems that are still being solved and will 
continue to be well into the next century. What is "obsolete" about current, 
off-the-shelf technology that has proven itself in Japan and Europe? 
</P>
<P>
 The projects that have been spelled out in the proposition have for the most 
part already been adopted but only partially funded, or not funded at all. 
Rather than selling more bonds, wouldn't it be better to use a new approach to 
their financing, one that assures we do not go further into debt?

 Re "Spare These 'Dinosaurs' an Untimely Death," by Melvin Kirschner, 
Commentary, Oct. 10: 
</P>
<P>
 The most charitable comment I can think of concerning Kirschner's views is 
that he is somewhat confused. His assertion that insurance companies have 
caused physicians to become less caring, honest, accessible and effective as 
referrers is both specious and inaccurate.It is specious because nearly 
everyone in our society still holds doctors in highest regard and rightfully 
believes that as a whole they are honest, caring, accessible and effective, 
whether they work under the HMO umbrella or not. It is inaccurate because 
nothing about an HMO precludes a primary care doctor such as Kirschner from 
referring a patient to a specialist. The fact that Kirschner can't choose which 
specialist the patient goes to or if he goes at all was true before HMOs were 
ever invented. 
</P>
<P>
 What Kirschner really objects to is the oversight an HMO provides physicians 
in the interest of controlling costs and reducing unnecessary and/or defensive 
medical procedures. He appears to believe that a government-run program will 
provide little or no oversight by comparison. If he is right, the system will 
explode financially as it was doing before managed care became pervasive. If he 
is wrong, the oversight will be provided by government bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients who move to an HMO have gained a choice, not lost one. They can still 
go to their general practitioner or gynecologist, whose fees are nearly always 
less than the deductible under indemnity plans, and pay as they always have, or 
they can go to the managed-care doctor and pay less.

FEINSTEIN, HUFFINGTON DEBATE

 Re "Feinstein, Huffington Trade Jabs in TV Debate," Oct. 7: 
</P>
<P>
 It is a sorry day in this country when Dianne Feinstein and Mike Huffington 
get an hour on Larry King's talk show and an actor gets an hour and a half, 
which King continuously advertised during the commercial breaks. The whole 
"exercise" (Larry King, commercials) is just one more example of where in the 
realm of interest the public and media rate our government. Perhaps if the 
American public cared more about their country than they do about the latest TV 
shows and movies, "politician" would not have become a dirty word.

 We have just read the first thing about Feinstein that we agree with. Quoted 
from the Nov. 8 California Voter Pamphlet which states, "I've been an 
independent voice working hard to break gridlock in Washington and make a 
difference on the issues that affect all Californians." Over the years we have 
written her many letters stating our opinion on various issues. So far her 
voting record is 100% contrary to the views and values we possess. According to 
our thesaurus independent means: self-ruling, self-reliant, self-governing and 
separate. We would rather have a senator who listens to her constituents and is 
not so independent.

 Critics of Huffington who claim he's never done anything for this state are 
quite mistaken: Between his House and Senate campaigns, he's pumped over $30 
million into California's economy. Now if someone can just persuade him to run 
for President, we may get out of this recession yet.

 Your editorial bias is an outrage. I hold no brief for Huffington, but your 
front-page coverage and pejorative headline are patent proof of a hatchet job. 
Of what relevance is it to his candidacy that his family's company bought a 
minority interest in an old and inevitably contaminated refinery (in which he 
had no managerial role)? 
</P>
<P>
 For balance, I trust you will publish a Page 1 headline that Feinstein's 
husband owned buildings with asbestos.

FLAWS IN PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Proposition 187, which would deny public social services to illegal 
immigrants, is deeply flawed legislation. Contrary to what proponents say, this 
ballot measure will not "save our state." The nonpartisan legislative analyst 
says California would risk losing $15 billion in federal funding. And it would 
cost additional millions to administer. Indeed, Proposition 187 should be 
called "sink our state." 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, the provisions of Proposition 187 have a certain appeal. 
People who are in this country illegally should not receive education, social 
services and health benefits. However, this initiative raises fundamental and 
troubling questions. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, where will the 300,000 children go who it is estimated will no 
longer be allowed in public schools because they or their parents or guardians 
are "suspected" of being in this country illegally? It is certainly naive to 
assume these children will return to their "country of origin" for schooling as 
the proposition states. Hundreds of out-of-school youths on the streets of our 
communities would generate problems we must prevent. And a great number of 
uneducated immigrant children would be a detriment to the social and economic 
well-being of the state's future. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the health of all Californians would be threatened if basic 
preventive services such as inoculations and immunizations are denied persons 
"suspected" of being undocumented and epidemic diseases take hold. The denial 
of child protective services could lead to an increase of abuse. Lack of 
preventive care leads to far more costly use of emergency rooms (which is 
allowed under this initiative). Denying prenatal care leads to far more costly 
treatment for low-birth-weight babies. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigration does generate problems for California, and these must be 
addressed in a nonpartisan manner. Proposition 187 does nothing to reduce or 
prevent illegal immigration. It does not call for increased border control or 
enforcement of employer sanctions. It would create far more problems than it 
solves. What Proposition 187 will do is adversely affect the quality of life of 
all of us who live in California.

A FIERCE GAME BETWEEN FRIENDS; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: PALS DONAHUE AND TOMEY FACE 
OFF AS UCLA VISITS ARIZONA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They are three coaches as close as any others in football, Dick Tomey said. 
For 51 weeks, they talk, sharing problems, seeking solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 52nd week, they try to beat each other's brains in. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Coach Terry Donahue, Oregon's Rich Brooks and Arizona's Tomey go a long 
way back, Donahue and Tomey to the staffs of Pepper Rodgers and Dick Vermeil at 
UCLA. When Donahue became the Bruins' coach in 1976, he named Tomey his 
defensive coordinator and Brooks the linebacker coach. 
</P>
<P>
 They have scattered since, but are never farther away than a telephone call. 
</P>
<P>
 The calls to Donahue lately have been sympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
 The sympathy will be suspended today, however, when Tomey's Arizona team plays 
host to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to see anybody go through that, particularly a friend," said Tomey of 
Donahue and the Bruins' five-game losing streak. "I know, however, that Rich 
was going through that a few weeks ago, and I know it turns around quickly. And 
Terry has the capability to last and turn those things around." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks and Oregon lost to Hawaii and Utah and had a 1-2 record before beating 
Iowa and USC to right things. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been through that here, and I think we all have empathy for each other 
when we go through those kinds of times because they happen to everybody," said 
Tomey, who had a 4-7 record in 1991. "Terry will have his team back playing 
well again soon, and I wouldn't be surprised if it was this week." 
</P>
<P>
 Tomey's best defensive player, end Tedy Bruschi, is not as sympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember last year," he said. "I remember being 7-0 and then losing to UCLA 
and then everything fell apart. I will not forget that this Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a different UCLA team, but Arizona is similar to the one that went 10-2, 
including a Fiesta Bowl shutout of Miami. The 14th-ranked Wildcats (5-1, 3-0 in 
the Pacific 10) are in control of the Rose Bowl race and in UCLA (2-5, 0-4) are 
facing a team that would appear to be a bump in the road to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 You could cast the Bruins in the role of spoilers, but it's difficult to cast 
them in any role except that of a team trying to avoid its first six-game 
losing streak since 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our problem right now is that we need to worry about ourselves," said 
Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to worry about how we're functioning, how we're executing, what we're 
doing, as much as what the other team is doing. . . . What we're doing as 
coaches is analyzing how to keep our players from making so many mistakes. Are 
things too complicated? Are the kids not concentrating? Are there too many 
young guys? Why can't we execute? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's more of a concern than, say, Arizona or anybody else we're playing 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The analysis has involved a potential quarterback change, a sophomore for a 
senior who led the Bruins to the Rose Bowl last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Cook will start for the eighth week in a row, but he will be on a short 
leash and Donahue said he would not hesitate to pull it, sending in sophomore 
Ryan Fien. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook passed for 270 yards and a touchdown last week and ranks second in the 
Pac-10 in passing yardage with 1,362. But the offense has become mistake-prone, 
and has shown a tendency to break down near the goal line. Fien has passed for 
176 yards but has a tendency to throw interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook gets the call largely because he engineered a 37-17 victory last season 
against Arizona, throwing two touchdown passes, and because Arizona's defense 
is considered too tough to give Fien his first start. 
</P>
<P>
 The breakdowns have revealed another problem that Donahue is still wrestling 
with: field goal kicking. Sophomore Bjorn Merten has made only four of his last 
11 and missed a 32-yarder last week in a 23-14 loss to Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
 Walk-on Greg Andrasick, who has yet to kick in a college game, has competed 
with Merten all week and the decision will not be made until coaches have seen 
both warm up today. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Cook or Fien will have J.J. Stokes to throw to is also questionable. 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes, who has played in parts of two games all season because of a thigh 
bruise, has returned to practice, but may not be ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
 In Arizona, the Bruins will play a team that was challenged once in its first 
four games, beating Georgia Tech, 19-13, in its opener, then coasting past New 
Mexico State, Stanford and Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came Colorado State, and the Wildcats say overconfidence led to their 
21-15 defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Saturday, in a hotel in Moscow, Ida., just down the road from Pullman, 
Wash., Tomey called in his players, one at a time, before they were to play 
Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't say much," said defensive tackle Chuck Osborne, Arizona's sack 
leader with seven. "He didn't say anything to some people. I think he just 
wanted to look us in the eyes, to see if we were ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense, Arizona's pride and joy, was ready and the Wildcats won, 10-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who didn't like that game doesn't like football," said Tomey, whose 
idea of winning involves defense, the kicking game and keeping the offense from 
screwing things up. "It was a real war. I think it renewed our sense of pride 
and the knowledge of what it takes to win." 
</P>
<P>
 That knowledge has escaped UCLA, whose coach will receive a phone call next 
week from an old friend. Who extends whom the sympathy will be determined 
today. UCLA BRUINS TODAY'S GAME

THIS BOLD PREDICTION WAS WIDE OF THE MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the Los Angeles Times, Nov. 23, 1993, college basketball national 
preview, by Gene Wojciechowski: "Two seasons from now you'll be talking about 
this team: UNLV. Rollie Massimino didn't leave Villanova for Vegas just so he 
could get a deal on show tickets. . . . Two years sounds about right until 
people are asking, 'Jerry, who?' " 
</P>
<P>
 It's two years (since Massimino was hired), and we've seen a record of 36-21, 
no Big West titles, no NCAA tournament appearances, a humiliating NIT 
first-round loss to USC, little visibility in the Las Vegas community, near 
fights with home fans at games, inability to recruit quality players, minimal 
ticket sales, a secret and illegal contract, and a program in shambles. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene, let's get it right: Rollie, who?

UCLA FANS MAY YET HAVE REASON TO CHEER AT END OF THIS SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Year after year, Bruin football fans traverse the season on the same emotional 
trail. 
</P>
<P>
 First, they hope UCLA goes undefeated and wins the national championship. That 
dream is usually squelched the first or second week. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, they wish for a Pac-10 championship and Rose Bowl trip. But as soon as 
that light fades, true Bruin fans get down to their most passionate desire: 
that the Bruins LOSE EVERY GAME the rest of the year and finally get Terry 
Donahue fired! 
</P>
<P>
 Take heart, Bruin fans, 2-9 might be just what we need.

 Those long-suffering Bruin fans who continue to desperately hope that the UCLA 
athletic hierarchy will fire Terry Donahue are doomed to endless 
disappointment. From 1989 to 1991, Donahue's record was 17-16-1. The response 
of (Chancellor Charles) Young and (Athletic Director Peter) Dalis was to give 
him a three-year contract extension. Since then, Donahue has gone 16-14, and 
his contract now runs through 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Time and again, the athletic administration has shown that it combines 
stupidity with stubbornness in unparalleled measure. The only possible hope is 
an absolute revolt from the heretofore sullen but acquiescent alumni and 
boosters, and the implosion of the entire athletic program. Maybe then a 
phoenix can rise from the ashes of this once-proud program.

</P>
<P>
 It has long been commonly known among the Bruin football faithful that Terry 
Donahue has worked tirelessly at lowering the high expectations of his players 
and UCLA fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, in 1988, the Bruins held the No. 1 spot for 13 short days until they 
blew a 27-6 third-quarter lead, at home, to Washington State and lost, 34-30. 
Since that bleak day, Donahue has gone on to accumulate a stellar record of 
36-31-1, which has certainly taught all UCLA fans a lesson and killed any such 
foolish talk of striving to win a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 As at all other schools, the football program generates the income to field 
all the other men's and women's teams. However, as revenues have continued to 
drop at UCLA, Pete Dalis, instead of going out and getting a top-notch coach, 
has inexplicably decided to eliminate entire programs. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last 30 years, UCLA has routinely won NCAA titles in virtually every 
sport, yet somehow accepts mediocrity in the one sport that never wins a 
national title and carries the burden of funding the entire athletic 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 Enough is enough.

BRUIN BATCHKOFF TOLD TO BACK OFF

 Here's to Frank Batchkoff. A guy who played four years at UCLA during which 
time the team won two Rose Bowls, a Fiesta Bowl, a Freedom Bowl and seven of 
every 10 games it played.A guy who claims, "Donahue was our Achilles' heel." 
Frank would look for the manure in a room full of ponies. Ninety-five percent 
of the I-A schools in this country would love to have the record that Coach 
Donahue has established at UCLA. By the way, Frank, didn't you sell your Rose 
Bowl tickets this year to a Wisconsin fan?

 I found it interesting that Bill Dwyre would solely quote Frank Batchkoff 
(Oct. 16) as a largely "credible" source in the assessment of Terry Donahue's 
coaching ability. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank would be well served to take a closer look at Donahue's track record. 
</P>
<P>
 I was fortunate to start one year at quarterback for UCLA and will always be 
able to look back on being a small part of a team that won a Fiesta Bowl 
against Miami and three Rose Bowl championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe my memory is clouded, but I recall our coach creating an air of team 
confidence and readiness.

 Don't worry about Lou Holtz keeping his winning percentage up. This year's

 At the pace the program is demising, I wouldn't be surprised to see him

TROJAN FAN ASKS: WHO'S STUPID NOW? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I wonder if Stanford Coach Bill Walsh has learned his lesson? 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, he has insulted USC players, coaches and faculty with remarks that 
he hopes would lead you to believe that they have low mentalities and are just 
plain stupid. He referred to USC as "Yesterday U." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, when "Yesterday U" played Stanford last Saturday, it won. And the best 
part was that it was helped by two penalties against Stanford for having 12 men 
on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice? Now that's stupid!

 Tom Reich, the agent for a half-dozen prominent players, met with NHL 
Commissioner Gary Bettman in an effort to intermediate in the ongoing dispute 
between the league and the players association. 
</P>
<P>
 Reich, who attempted to play a similar role in the baseball strike, said his 
involvement "is to try to contribute ideas and dialogue to encourage the 
process. . . . The only ones who can resolve it are Bob (Goodenow, head of the 
NHLPA), and Gary."He added, "I view this differently from baseball. In 
baseball, they set out to level a successful union. In hockey, there's no 
question (owners) want some things but I get the feeling hockey owners want to 
play hockey. I hold out much more hope for a negotiated settlement in hockey. 
I'm not optimistic about a negotiated settlement in baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman and Goodenow spoke by phone late Thursday and at least once Friday -- 
their first contact since Oct. 11 -- but a spokesman for the NHLPA said they 
did not arrange a negotiating session. A league spokesman refused to comment on 
the conversations. The 21-day lockout has wiped out 115 games. Miscellany

 The Las Vegas Posse of the Canadian Football League, which drew only 2,350 to 
its most recent home game, will play its final home game against the Edmonton 
Eskimos in the Canadian city. . . . The CFL pulled the plug on the Posse's 
final home game, which had been scheduled for Nov. 5, after the tiny crowd 
turned out for last week's game against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers.

NBA ROUNDUP; THREATT REJOINS LAKERS, TO BE FINED FOR WALKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sedale Threatt, who began an unexplained absence from the Lakers last 
Saturday, rejoined the team at a Friday morning practice, the Lakers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Threatt will be fined for missing three preseason games and any practices 
since he went AWOL last Saturday in Honolulu, Public Relations Director John 
Black said. 
</P>
<P>
 It had been reported Threatt was unhappy with his contract, which has two 
seasons remaining. But Black said Friday he was told Threatt's absence was due 
to unspecified "personal reasons" having nothing to do with his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Threatt, a 33-year-old backup at both point guard and shooting guard, is 
entering his fourth season with the Lakers after being obtained in 1991 from 
Seattle in exchange for three second-round draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
 He was among the Laker scoring leaders in 1991-92 and the following season 
with 15.1 points per game each year. But his playing time declined during the 
Lakers' youth movement in 1993-94, and his average fell to 11.9 points per 
game. 
</P>

 Philadelphia center Shawn Bradley will miss up to six weeks with sprained 
ligaments in the same knee that kept him off the basketball court for 2 1/2 
months last season, the 76ers said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7-foot-6 center injured his left knee and skipped off the court in pain 
during Philadelphia's 105-98 exhibition victory Wednesday over Minnesota. Last 
season, his first in the NBA after being drafted second overall in 1993, he 
suffered a dislocated kneecap in the same leg and missed 32 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Team doctor Jack McPhilemy also said forward Scott Williams will miss a week 
because of a sprained back. 
</P>
<P>
 "When an injury like this occurs, you always fear the worst," said John Lucas, 
the team's coach and general manager. "However, we are relieved that the 
diagnosis for both Shawn and Scott is optimistic, and that both will be back 
with us in the very near future." 
</P>
<P>
 Team spokesman Joe Favorito said Bradley's two injuries were related, but the 
latest problem centered on the way Bradley came down and landed on Doug West's 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it related to a chronic problem?" Favorito said. "Not at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 If Bradley heals quickly, he could be ready in a month, Lucas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The injuries leave Philadelphia thin along its front line. Bradley and 
Williams were expected to start with first-round pick Sharone Wright. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sixers were hoping for a big season out of Bradley after he underwent a 
strenuous weight program with former Mr. Universe Lee Haney and workouts with 
NBA career scoring leader Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley signed an eight-year, $44.2 million contract, and averaged 10.3 points 
and 6.2 rebounds and blocked 147 shots in 49 games last season.

OFF THE TICKER: KIAM SHAVES $73,400 OFF BRITISH PAPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Victor Kiam, owner of electric shaver maker Remington Corp., won $73,400 in 
libel damages from a British newspaper that said he had filed for bankruptcy 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
 The London-based Sunday Times claimed in December, 1991, that Kiam was being 
sued by National Westminster Bank after defaulting on a $13.5-million loan he 
used to buy a U.S. football team, the New England Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can now walk tall and say that they couldn't just wipe it off with an 
apology in the paper. . . . I have been vindicated in the British courts system 
and I stand now clean and pure," Kiam said after the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The 67-year-old businessman said the newspaper report, which had resulted from 
a researching error, had damaged his reputation and dogged his business 
dealings. He was forced to contact suppliers all over the world and his 
executives had to inform retailers that the newspaper report was not true.

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: CHIT CHAT; PREPAID PHONE CARDS EXPECTED TO 
TAKE OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Only a tiny fraction of the American public knows what they are, but telephone 
industry insiders are hitching their wagons to prepaid phone cards -- a 
business that could easily exceed $1 billion annually by 1996.  
</P>
<P>
 Since the beginning of the year, the debit cards for long-distance calls have 
been launched by the millions. Issuers range from the big names in 
long-distance to banks and entertainment companies. And although using prepaid 
cards for calls has long been common in other countries, the business is in its 
infancy here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am convinced that every grocery store, convenience store and gas station 
will be selling prepaid calling cards within the next 12 months," says Terry 
Macko, director of Phone Cash marketing at MCI. "They are taking off as an 
entirely new retail category." 
</P>
<P>
 What are prepaid phone cards?  
</P>
<P>
 They're pieces of plastic that bear an 800 number and a personal 
identification number. By dialing the toll-free number and punching in your 
PIN, you can gain access to an "account" that entitles you to a set number of 
minutes of phone time. The amount of time you get -- and the price of the calls 
-- is set when you buy the card. The expiration of the time allotment varies by 
company: Some expire after several months, a year or not at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Some phone card companies also offer additional services -- payable from your 
account -- that range from faxes to phone sex. 
</P>
<P>
 With technological advances and growing competition, the cards' promoters see 
advantages for everyone.  
</P>
<P>
 The phone companies like prepaid accounts because they don't have to send you 
a bill or worry that you won't pay. Non-phone companies can use them as 
advertising vehicles. For a few dollars a card, you can provide someone with a 
collectible bit of plastic that will deliver an advertising message every time 
it's used or looked at. 
</P>
<P>
 Some users of long-distance services will like them because they're sometimes 
cheaper than calling collect or using a phone credit card. Collectors like them 
because some are attractive, and the rarer cards can appreciate in value. One 
of the first cards ever issued in the United States -- a promotional giveaway 
with $1 in phone time -- recently sold for $1,700. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, using the card accounts can be a bargain for people making short 
phone calls away from home -- assuming they'd otherwise call collect or use a 
calling card. That's because fees are minimal. But on longer calls, the prepaid 
calls often cost more. And calling direct from home will usually be cheaper.  
</P>
<P>
 But experts are beginning to voice concerns about the industry, which is 
largely unregulated. Some worry about con artists selling worthless card 
accounts, and they note that children can use them to get around "phone 
blocking" and other restrictions.  
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, because the cards can be purchased at supermarkets like lottery 
tickets or bread, buyers are largely anonymous. That could make the cards a 
convenient vehicle for criminals and other people -- such as unfaithful spouses 
-- who want to keep conversation records off their phone bills.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's the vast new frontier," says Barbara Esbin, assistant chief of the 
tariff division at the Federal Communications Commission, who spoke at a summer 
conference on prepaid cards. "As I looked out over the audience in June, it 
ranged from the Bell-heads to people you would expect to see selling watches on 
42nd Street -- and everybody in between."  
</P>
<P>
 Of particular concern to regulators is fraud. Because consumers are buying 
calling time in advance, they are out of luck if the company disbands while 
they still have time in their accounts.  
</P>
<P>
 "There is a legitimate need and market for these cards, but at the same time 
there is a whole lot of opportunity for consumers to get hurt," says Ron 
Choura, deputy director of policy at the Michigan Public Service Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Even among legitimate issuers there are wide variations in the price and 
services provided, which could confuse consumers trying to figure out if the 
card accounts are a bargain or a bust.  
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Regulatory Utility Commissioners has suggested uniform 
disclosure of rates and conditions, but these rules are not enforceable, notes 
Choura, an author of the report.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the prepaid phone card industry is booming. Virtually all major 
phone companies have issued cards in the past nine months. Pacific Bell, for 
example, has just launched three -- one pictures Olvera Street and another is a 
Los Angeles collage.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a dizzying array of telephone time resellers, who buy long-distance 
time in bulk and then resell it to consumers, are selling prepaid phone cards 
through banks, communications companies and even travel agencies. The 
distributor gets a commission, publicity or some free time to distribute to 
loyal customers.  
</P>
<P>
 When "The Princess and the Goblin," an animated children's movie, went to 
video, for example, it included a trailer selling Los Angeles-based Hemdale 
Telecommunications' "Magic Phone Card" -- a prepaid card for the preschool set. 
An Escondido, Calif., company called Global Communications recently started 
marketing a "TravelCall Card" for travel agents to sell to their clients.  
</P>
<P>
 Some cards offer discounted time in exchange for listening to an advertising 
pitch; others are bonuses for attending a meeting or buying a product.  
</P>
<P>
 Cards that become collectors items can be especially profitable to the issuers 
because the phone time on them may have expired unused. That time remains on 
the issuer's books.  
</P>
<P>
 As a way to buy phone time, prepaid card accounts may be particularly useful 
for parents to give college students or for anyone without their own phone 
service. With a prepaid card, you limit your spending and can buy calling time 
for as little as 25 cents a minute. While that's no bargain for local calls -- 
or for after-hours long-distance -- it often beats collect-calling rates by a 
mile.  
</P>
<P>
 Prepaid calling cards are not new. They've been used in Europe and Asia for 
decades. But in other countries, the account is often in the card itself, 
either in a chip or on a magnetic strip.  
</P>
<P>
 In roughly 170 countries, the cards have evolved to serve the function phone 
credit cards serve in the United States. International collectors have long 
traded and sold them like baseball cards, coins and stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, however, users of prepaid phone accounts generally must 
use the 800 and PIN number system. When you run low on time, you can "recharge" 
the card by punching in a credit card number or buying a new card.  
</P>
<P>
 Because the products are unfamiliar to U.S. consumers, many fear they will 
become disenchanted when they find that the cards cost more than they thought. 
And, as with any industry that sprouts overnight, there's the risk that card 
companies will fail, leaving customers with worthless pieces of plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a sense, it is how a competitive industry develops," says Audrie Krause, 
executive director of Toward Utility Rate Normalization, a consumer watchdog 
group. "People begin business and they go out of business when they're not 
successful. But from a consumer standpoint, it's a problem. There is certainly 
a lot of potential for customers to get ripped off."

STATE OKS FIRST HIKES IN EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE; REGULATION: THE INCREASES RANGE 
FROM 37% TO 209%. SIXTY OTHER REQUESTS HAVE BEEN FILED SINCE THE NORTHRIDGE 
TEMBLOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Californians will soon begin paying sharply higher premiums for earthquake 
insurance, as Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi on Friday approved the 
first round of rate increases since the Northridge temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the rate hikes affect only five insurers, representing about 5% of 
the state market, they are just the front edge of a wave of 65 requests filed 
since the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Safeco Insurance Co. of America, the largest of the first five, with about 
57,000 earthquake policyholders in California, was granted a 37% increase. For 
most Safeco customers, the new rate is $2.51 per $1,000 of coverage, with a 10% 
deductible, meaning that a customer with policy limits of $200,000 would pay 
$502 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is with regret that we must grant the first residential earthquake rate 
increases in close to 20 years," Garamendi said in a statement, "but the rating 
methods used by these companies and the resulting rates are in a reasonable 
range given the losses from the Northridge earthquake and forecasts for future 
quake losses." 
</P>
<P>
 Facing estimated quake losses totaling $10 billion or more, virtually all 
large property insurers have suspended or restricted their writings of new 
homeowners and earthquake policies in California. 
</P>
<P>
 It was too early Friday to tell whether the price increases might melt the 
freeze on writing new policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of Seattle-based Safeco called the rate hike "a good first step" on 
Friday, but the company said it has not decided whether to relax its moratorium 
on new homeowners and earthquake policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Other increases granted Friday were for Prudential Property & Casualty, $2.25 
per $1,000 with a 15% deductible, a 122% increase; Safeco Insurance Co. of 
Illinois (a sister of Safeco of America), $2.76 with a 10% deductible, up 49%; 
Michigan Millers Mutual Insurance Co., $1.95 with a 10% deductible, up 209%, 
and American Family Home Insurance, $2 with a 10% deductible, up 208%. The 
latter two companies specialize in mobile home insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The increases are effective immediately but are not retroactive, so a customer 
who renewed a policy in September would not get the increase until the policy 
expires in another 11 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the remaining rate increases will probably be approved within the next 
few weeks, but some will be held up for further negotiations and a few for 
full-blown hearings, Deputy Insurance Commissioner William Ahern said. 
</P>
<P>
 Market leader State Farm has not yet filed a request but is expected to do so. 
No. 2 Allstate seeks a 100% increase, to $3 per $1,000 with a 10% deductible. 
</P>
<P>
 The most controversial request is that of Farmers Insurance Group, 
California's third-largest homeowners and earthquake insurer, which seeks a 
174% increase to $4.30 per $1,000 on policies with a 15% deductible. Farmers 
would also require a 20% co-payment on any claims exceeding the deductible. 
Thus, on a $200,000 claim, the 15% deductible would be $30,000 and the 
co-payment another $34,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling Farmers' filing "complicated and unusual," Ahern said it would be the 
first personal property policy he has seen with a co-payment. Co-payments are 
common on health insurance policies.

CRAIG MCCAW ISSUES A 'NO THANKS' TO AT&T'S OFFER OF SEAT ON BOARD; 
COMMUNICATIONS: BILLIONAIRE ENTREPRENEUR MAY BE LOOKING AT NICHE IN GLOBAL 
SATELLITE TECHNOLOGY.

 Craig McCaw, founder and former chairman of McCaw Cellular Communications, 
said Friday that he won't join the board of AT&T Corp., which acquired his 
company last month. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the nation's most successful entrepreneurs, McCaw became a billionaire 
as his company became the largest cellular firm. His interest in global 
satellite technology and other communications systems that rival AT&T's could 
present the appearance of conflict if he were on the AT&T board. 
</P>
<P>
 McCaw, in a statement, said he wanted to avoid such an appearance by anything 
he does in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though I will not be a board member, I will be pleased to give any 
advice or counsel I can to AT&T whenever it is sought," McCaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 While he and Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates have invested in a firm that 
is exploring creation of a global satellite network, McCaw has no other 
ventures immediately planned, said Bob Ratliffe, spokesman for McCaw Cellular. 
</P>
<P>
 When AT&T's acquisition was announced in August, 1993, McCaw said he would no 
longer play a day-to-day role in the company. Jim Barksdale, who had been 
president of McCaw Cellular, now leads the wireless subsidiary of AT&T. 
</P>
<P>
 McCaw will continue to hold his AT&T stock, Ratliffe said. Documents related 
to the $11.5-billion transaction in February showed that McCaw would own 14 
million AT&T shares when the deal was complete, making him the largest 
individual shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sounds like a code for 'Thank you for making me richer, it's been fun, 
and I will see you in my next venture,' " said Ken McGee, an analyst at the 
Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn. "McCaw obviously has a burr in his saddle that 
he wants to pursue." 
</P>
<P>
 McCaw wasn't immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to stay off AT&T's board may have been a function of Craig 
McCaw's entrepreneurial ways, and AT&T's gray-suited corporate mentality. McCaw 
has seemed uneasy at public appearances with AT&T officials since the merger 
was announced in August, 1993, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, Craig has differences in opinion as to the manner in which McCaw 
should be merged with AT&T and the future direction of the companies," said 
Daniel Briere, an analyst at TeleChoice, a Verona, N.J.-based market 
researcher. 
</P>
<P>
 McCaw had kind words for AT&T, though. "Much to its credit, AT&T is working 
exceedingly hard to develop a broad array of products and services that 
demystify and simplify the information superhighway for an increasingly broad 
group of customers," McCaw said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 He said AT&T's efforts "make it difficult for me to make even minor 
contributions to the telecommunications industry and not be perceived to be 
technically in conflict with my duties as a director of AT&T." 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T's chairman, Robert Allen, said: "I understand Craig's reasons and 
appreciate his concern and candor in addressing the potential for conflicts of 
interest in advance. We also appreciate his offer to be helpful." 
</P>
<P>
 At least one analyst said McCaw may have wireless alternatives on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "McCaw may want to do something involving the (personal communications 
services) market," said Alvin Mirman, an analyst at Gruntal & Co. "That would 
be a brilliant move on his part. He sold his company at top dollar. Maybe he 
could get a PCS license and start all over again." 
</P>
<P>
 PCS is a new generation of wireless technology that will let users send voice, 
data and video over hand-held devices that resemble cellular phones but work on 
different frequencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Communications Commission plans to peddle that previously untapped 
spectrum at an auction in December. Analysts expect the government to raise 
more than $10 billion from the auction.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOLLAR UNSETTLES STOCK MARKET; TREASURY DEPT. AVOWS SUPPORT; 
WALL STREET: CONTRADICTORY SIGNALS BY TOP OFFICIALS SEND TRADERS SCRAMBLING. 
DOW FALLS 19.85; BONDS STABILIZE.

<P>
 The embattled dollar edged upward on financial markets Friday, following 
comments by top Treasury Department officials that the United States will buy 
greenbacks if necessary to safeguard the currency's value. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the last legs of this downward move in the dollar," said Robert A. 
White, senior vice president at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. "The 
fundamentals dictate that the dollar should be higher." 
</P>
<P>
 But uncertainty continued to surround the U.S. currency, unsettling the stock 
market for the second straight day with fears of inflation and rising interest 
rates. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 19.85 points at 3,891.30. 
The bond market stabilized, with the 30-year Treasury bond yield slipping to 
7.98% from 7.996% at Thursday's close. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar, meanwhile, flirted with record lows before ending higher. 
</P>
<P>
 It regained some ground against the German mark to end at 1.4995 marks in New 
York, up from 1.4923 on Thursday, the lowest level in two years. It was valued 
at 97.19 Japanese yen, compared to 97.10 yen the day before. Early Friday, it 
closed in Tokyo at 96.98 yen, the lowest finish in Japan since the modern 
exchange rate system was set up in the late 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the dollar depreciates, the (stock and bond) markets assume that it's 
another reason for (the Federal Reserve Board) to raise interest rates," said 
Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis. "It scares the 
heck out of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Bewildered currency traders Friday had to scramble to follow an unusual series 
of policy statements on the dollar that emanated from the highest levels of the 
Treasury Department.  
</P>
<P>
 That mini-drama began Thursday, when Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said 
U.S. officials had no plans to prop up the currency's value through 
intervention -- massive dollar purchases by the United States and other 
nations. Currency speculators took Bentsen's remark as a green light to bid 
down the dollar, which plunged against the German mark, Japanese yen and 
British pound. 
</P>
<P>
 But Treasury officials were apparently uncomfortable with that spectacle. The 
dollar has fallen almost 2% against the mark and 1.4% against the yen this 
month alone. 
</P>
<P>
 So Treasury Undersecretary Lawrence Summers, Bentsen's lieutenant, switched 
signals by declaring Friday that "there are times when intervention is 
appropriate."  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Bentsen released his own statement that intervention could be 
"effective," adding that "we are concerned about recent movements in the 
dollar. As we have said, we prefer a stronger dollar." 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar stabilized following the remarks, bringing a pause to the weeklong 
gyrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Private investors began moving against the dollar Monday, interpreting the 
election victory of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition as a sign of 
stability in the mark. Those sentiments were reinforced by upcoming U.S. 
elections and skepticism about President Clinton's policies, which make the 
dollar less attractive to foreign investors, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts also said basic economic forces have undermined the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 The ongoing U.S. trade deficit means that billions and billions of dollars 
continue to flow out of the country, creating a surplus in the world and 
cheapening their value. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors seemed to respond to this phenomenon earlier this week, when the 
dollar tumbled against the yen on news of an expanding U.S. trade gap with 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Norwest's Sohn estimated that the 1994 and '95 overall deficits in the 
nation's current account -- the broadest measure of the trade balance -- could 
total $250 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the reasons the dollar is doing especially poorly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a seeming paradox, however, the dollar's exceptionally low level could 
prove self-correcting, economists said. That is because a weak dollar provides 
U.S. exporters a price advantage against their foreign rivals, paving the way 
for progress in the trade deficit.  
</P>
<P>
 "You gotta like the dollar," wrote Stephen Roach, an economist at Morgan 
Stanley, in a recent analysis that forecast steady improvements in the trade 
deficit, propelled by efficient U.S. industry and growing purchases of American 
goods by recovering nations overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 In the short run, however, many analysts are scratching their heads over 
Bentsen's initial hands-off comment and the subsequent clarifications that 
ensued. 
</P>
<P>
 Said one observer: "I was at the Fed yesterday, and they were shocked that he 
(Bentsen) would say that."  
</P>
<P>
 Still others maintain there was logic behind the secretary's comment, however 
inflammatory the words may have sounded to financial speculators. Many experts 
believe that in the long term it has become a futile exercise for national 
governments to challenge the will of the huge private market in currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of the first sensible comments on foreign exchange that I've heard 
coming out of the Treasury," said Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI-McGraw 
Hill in Lexington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Friday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 3 to 2 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, where volume was a heavy 309.35 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Dow, broad market indexes closed lower. 
</P>
<P>
 * GM fell 1 3/4 to 41 3/8 in very heavy trading after tumbling 3 3/4 on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Silicon Graphics jumped 2 3/4 to 29 after posting earnings that beat 
analysts' forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Community Psychiatric Centers lost 3 to 9 1/2 after saying its 
fourth-quarter results will not meet analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Summit Technology rose 2 3/8 to 34 7/8 on news that an advisory panel to the 
FDA had recommended approval of the company's excimer laser for treatment of 
nearsightedness. Dollar Takes a Plunge 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar has plunged against the German mark for most of the year. The 
dollar in marks, weekly closes since June: 
</P>
<P>
 Friday: 1.4995

REVISED SYSTEM FOR SMALL-LOT TRADES DECRIED AS UNFAIR; ACCESS: SOME SMALLER 
TRADERS SAY THE PROPOSED CHANGE WOULD FAVOR BIG-TIME DEALERS. OFFICIALS SAY IT 
FAVORS STABILITY. 
</P>

<P>
 On Black Monday in October, 1987, when the Dow Jones industrial average fell a 
record 508 points, none of America's major securities exchanges performed worse 
than Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than making markets as they were supposed to, many Nasdaq dealers 
simply stopped trading -- and stopped answering their phones, according to a 
presidential task force appointed to look into the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 One result: Individual investors who wanted to sell before prices fell further 
couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many investors, both large and small, the over-the-counter market broke 
down," the task force report said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the crash, Nasdaq undertook a big improvement designed 
specifically for small investors: a major enhancement of its computerized 
small-order execution system (known as SOES), which completes trades 
automatically, without the need for a phone call to a market maker. 
</P>
<P>
 All market makers were required to participate in SOES. So for orders to trade 
up to 1,000 shares at market prices, investors essentially were guaranteed the 
right to buy or sell stock swiftly at the current quoted price. 
</P>
<P>
 But SOES may soon be no more. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Securities Dealers, which operates Nasdaq, has already 
sharply scaled back the system. In January, it cut the maximum SOES order to 
500 shares. And it is awaiting approval from the Securities and Exchange 
Commission to eliminate SOES altogether -- and replace it with a new system 
favored by Nasdaq's big market makers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The NASD contends that the new N-Prove system would benefit small investors, 
giving them more of a shot at buying or selling stock at better than the quoted 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 But in letters to the SEC, many investors and professionals have said the 
benefits would be largely illusory. In the event of another crash, they say, it 
would be much less likely that small investors' orders would be executed 
quickly by N-Prove. 
</P>
<P>
 According to SEC sources, SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. agrees -- and is 
likely to try to force the NASD to make major changes. 
</P>
<P>
 As now proposed, critics say the chief effect of N-Prove would be to allow 
market makers more freedom to duck small customers' orders -- if the market 
makers do not think they can make a profit on the trades. 
</P>
<P>
 And SEC officials who have evaluated the N-Prove plan say it would ensure that 
market makers -- not customers -- get first crack at the best orders, 
officially sanctioning a practice known as "trading ahead" (or "front running") 
that the SEC says should be banned. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department confirmed this week that it has launched an antitrust 
investigation of Nasdaq, which since the 1987 crash has grown into the nation's 
busiest stock market, an electronic bazaar where, on average, about 299 million 
shares trade daily. The NASD says allegations that market makers collude to fix 
prices are baseless, and it insists that the Justice Department will reach the 
same conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 The threatened demise of SOES reflects conflicts rending the ranks of Nasdaq 
traders. 
</P>
<P>
 When SOES was beefed up after the crash, some small traders used it heavily. 
Their foes protested that these traders -- whom the NASD initially dubbed "SOES 
bandits" -- were picking off market makers who were slow to update their quotes 
in rapidly changing markets. The dealers were said to be using SOES' swift, 
automatic execution to reap quick profits at the expense of unwary market 
makers. For their part, the SOES traders argued they were staying within the 
rules, legally exploiting a system the NASD had created. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the new N-Prove system, these pick-offs would not be possible. But 
critics, in comments filed with the SEC, contend that the plan would take away 
protections for small investors at the same time it punishes the SOES 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
 The critics, including Jeffrey P. Ricker, a San Francisco-based consultant to 
institutional investors, note that N-Prove, unlike SOES, would give market 
makers an opportunity to reject trades. And it would allow a significant amount 
of time to elapse before an order is executed, during which the price of a 
stock could change substantially. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than an order being executed instantaneously, as under SOES, each 
market maker would have a chance to reject the order, allowing up to 45 seconds 
to pass before the computer finally selected one against which to execute the 
order automatically. 
</P>
<P>
 If all the market makers said they were in the process of changing their 
quotes when the order came in, the customer would get the stock at the new 
price, not at the quote posted when the order was entered. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael F. Frey, president of A.J. Michaels & Co., a Hauppauge, N.Y., trading 
firm that was among the SOES activists, notes that in a rapidly moving market, 
45 seconds can be an eternity.  
</P>
<P>
 "Count off 15 seconds and see how long that seems to you," Frey says. His 
point: 15 seconds is plenty of time for market makers to tap a couple of keys 
on their computers and change their quotes -- and thus enough time to ensure 
that an order is executed at a worse price. 
</P>
<P>
 The NASD claims N-Prove will give small investors a much-improved chance to 
get prices inside the spread -- that is, better than the quoted bid or asked 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Customer orders to buy or sell stock at a specified price -- so-called limit 
orders -- would go into the N-Prove computer. If an order came into the system 
to sell at the going market price and there was a limit order already in the 
system to buy at a price higher than the market makers were offering, the lucky 
seller would be able to sell at the higher, better price. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the customer who put in the limit order wouldn't necessarily get to 
buy the stock. That's because N-Prove would give the market makers first crack 
at matching the limit-order price. They would have 15 seconds to do so. So the 
small investor on the other side of the transaction -- the one who offered a 
better price to begin with -- might lose out to the market makers. 
</P>
<P>
 "In essence, this rule is an incredibly blatant license for front running," 
Ricker objected in a letter to the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
 In its proposal, the NASD said giving market makers the chance to run ahead of 
customer limit orders is necessary; otherwise, it said, "market maker 
profitability will suffer," potentially drying up liquidity on Nasdaq. The NASD 
says liquidity -- a market's ability to absorb large trades with minimal impact 
on prices -- is one of Nasdaq's key virtues. 
</P>
<P>
 Another criticism of N-Prove: Only limit orders from small investors would 
enter the system. So small investors would miss out on better prices being 
offered by big investors, including mutual funds and other institutions, that 
execute their trades over other networks. 
</P>
<P>
 And some individual investors say it is unfair that short selling would be 
banned completely on N-Prove, as it has been on SOES since January. Short 
selling involves selling borrowed stock in expectation that the stock's price 
will soon go down. If it does, the investor buys it back at the new, lower 
price and pockets the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Short selling is freely allowed to larger traders and market makers on Nasdaq 
-- and to all investors on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Why deny short selling to N-Prove users? Richard G. Ketchum, the NASD's chief 
operating officer, said there were too many abuses by the activist firms when 
short selling was allowed on SOES. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ronald Sudol, a retired engineer in New Jersey who spends much of his time 
trading small quantities of Nasdaq stocks, complains that the ban on short 
selling is unfair. "Market makers can play both sides," he said. "We're only 
allowed one side."

 The electronic Nasdaq market has grown into the nation's busiest marketplace 
for buying and selling stocks, with higher trading volume than the better-known 
New York Stock Exchange. Nasdaq is where investors trade shares of Intel, 
Microsoft, MCI, Apple Computer and other leading firms, along with those of 
hundreds of smaller companies.

O.C. UNEMPLOYMENT RATE INCHES UP TO 6%; LABOR: LOCAL MANUFACTURING, FINANCE, 
INSURANCE, REAL ESTATE AND RETAIL JOBS ARE CUT. NATIONAL AND STATE JOBLESS 
ROLLS SHRINK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a cheerless report Friday, the state employment department said Orange 
County's jobless rate edged up to 6% in September from 5.9% in August, with 
several key sectors showing job losses. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, unemployment rates for the nation, California and Los Angeles 
County all fell significantly in September from August. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Orange County employers added 5,400 jobs to local payrolls last 
month, all of it seasonal as an army of teachers and other school employees 
returned to work. But a regional decline in employment in manufacturing, retail 
trade, finance and real estate lifted the county's jobless rate nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 The job report from the state Employment Development Department provided more 
sobering news about an economy whose revival has been dimmed somewhat by recent 
announcements of mass layoffs at Hughes Aircraft and AST Research. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us would like to see a recovery in Orange County, but the numbers 
(show) that we have a difficult period ahead," said Anil Puri, chairman of Cal 
State Fullerton's economics department. "It's going to be a struggle to 
generate jobs in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 79,300 Orange County residents were without jobs while 1.25 
million people who live in the county were working, the state employment 
department reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Esmael Adibi, director of Chapman's College Center for Economic Research, 
agreed that the latest jobs report was not uplifting. But he said that Orange 
County's economy is still "moving in the right direction." The loss of 
non-seasonal jobs in industries like manufacturing was smaller than in past 
months, he said. And missing from the state's monthly survey are job gains made 
by many local mom-and-pop businesses -- which aren't counted in the tally of 
local employment. 
</P>
<P>
 One encouraging sign in Friday's report is that Orange County's jobless rate 
for September was down more than one full percentage point from the 7.1% 
reported in September, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Total civilian employment in the county last month was up 38,700 from a year 
earlier, but Adibi said the increase largely reflects the surge in 
self-employed workers -- people who operate their own businesses and work as 
free-lancers, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 While a spurt of self-employed workers is common in the early stages of a 
recovery, economists like Adibi are waiting for hiring by companies -- a more 
reliable indicator of a healthy economy. And that doesn't appear to be 
happening yet. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's non-farm payroll employment -- which excludes the self-employed 
and agriculture workers -- was down 1,000 in September from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Employers are still hesitant to go out and hire employees," Adibi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest payroll data, based on reports from generally larger companies, 
showed that manufacturing employment in the county fell by 300 in September 
from August. The finance, insurance and real estate industries shed 200 jobs, 
and retail trade overall employment dropped by 400. 
</P>
<P>
 In seasonal changes, the services sector lost 1,200 from August to September, 
mostly because of the job cuts in the amusement industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, local government added 7,100 to its payroll as Orange County 
schools and universities reopened. Construction employment was up by 100 in the 
county in September from August. 
</P>
<P>
 While analysts expect payroll employment to pick up slowly in Orange County, 
they also noted that large layoffs announced recently by Hughes and AST will 
slow the recovery. Combined, those two companies plan to shed more than 6,000 
jobs based in Orange County, many of them high-paying technical work. (Orange 
County Edition, A1) Jobless Jump 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's unemployment rate increased marginally in September to 6.0%. 
That rate was up slightly from August's 5.9%.

ROCKWELL BID IS CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to a $1.5-billion hostile takeover bid from Seal Beach-based 
Rockwell International Corp., Reliance Electric Co., the Cleveland-based 
industrial products concern, asked its stockholders not to tender their shares 
to the firm until Reliance's board weighs the $30-a-share cash offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The directors are "carefully considering the terms," said Reliance, which 
earlier agreed to merge with General Signal Corp. in a stock swap valued at 
$1.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, shareholders of Reliance filed two lawsuits in Delaware 
Chancery Court, charging directors with breach of fiduciary duty in connection 
with Reliance's proposed takeover by General Signal.

 AMD to Stop Making 486 Chips With Disputed Code: Intel Corp. and Advanced 
Micro Devices Inc. agreed that AMD will stop making the microprocessors 
containing the software but may continue to sell most of the existing chips. 
The agreement partly settles one of several legal disputes between the computer 
chip firms.They struck the bargain after U.S. Magistrate Judge Patricia 
Trumbull in San Jose refused Intel's request to order AMD not to sell any 486 
chips with the disputed in-circuit emulation, or "ICE," code. Trumbull had 
ruled last week that AMD violated copyright laws when it included the code in 
its Am486 microprocessors. The agreement will allow AMD to sell existing 486 
microprocessors in which the code is disabled until Jan. 15.

MINORITIES, WOMEN GET CONTRACT LEADS

 Calvin Madlock came looking for contracts for his year-old computer consulting 
and software development company. Marion E. Maddox, a former nurse, came to 
find out how to strike out on her own in business.And Joyce D. Sharpe arrived 
with a list of services her employer, Southern California Edison, wants to 
purchase from small, minority-owned companies. 
</P>
<P>
 They all met Friday during the Los Angeles Urban League's 14th annual Career 
Connections conference, which is designed to showcase Southern California's 
minority- and women-owned businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose was to bring minority and (women-owned) businesses to 
organizations that will assist and enhance them," said organizer Barbara 
Dent-Jiles, manager of the Urban League's Pomona office. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-six exhibitors, including the Small Business Administration and several 
large corporations such as Edison, offered information and opportunities for 
contracts during the conference, which concludes today at the Los Angles 
Airport Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
 Many corporations want to help, said Sharpe, a diversity program 
representative for Edison, but her company already has vendors for some of the 
services offered by the firms at the conference. "If there is an opportunity, 
then we'll work with them. But some areas are too saturated." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, most of the minority and women business owners at the conference were 
enthusiastic about the opportunity to make contacts. "I hope to get a 
contract," said Madlock, the 34-year-old owner of Los Angeles-based Madlock 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Minority-owned firms must take the initiative to find out what opportunities 
are available, said Liting Zhang, co-owner of Alda Co., a Chatsworth-based 
stationery supplier. "If we don't try, nothing is going to happen," said Zhang, 
44, who runs her company with three other women.

S&LS' QUARTERLY EARNINGS PLUMMET; THRIFTS: RISING INTEREST RATES BLAMED FOR 
SLUMP TO $45.7 MILLION FROM LAST YEAR'S $74.6 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Orange County's savings and loans, hurt by rising interest rates earlier this 
year, earned $45.7 million for the second quarter, or about a third less than 
the $74.6 million that the local thrifts earned in last year's second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16 S&Ls based in the county also had earned a greater amount in the first 
three months this year -- $66.2 million, according to figures released by the 
U.S. Office of Thrift Supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's mainly a reflection of the interest rate market," said Stephen W. 
Prough, president of Downey Savings & Loan in Newport Beach. "You would expect 
that companies that are sensitive to interest rates would see a tightening of 
their profit margin." 
</P>
<P>
 The higher interest rates earlier this year cooled off the overheated market 
for home loan refinancings, but thrifts began seeing an increase in dormant 
home loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortgage bankers were hurt in the process, but S&Ls began making more 
adjustable-rate loans for home purchases, typically offering low introductory 
rates for the first three months. The ability of adjustable-rate mortgage rates 
to fluctuate with changing interest rates is believed to help thrifts better 
manage their profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because we're seeing higher volumes of ARM loans, those lower introductory 
rates are showing up as lower income in second-quarter and probably 
third-quarter earnings," Prough said. "But long term, making ARM loans is the 
right decision for a lot of institutions." 
</P>
<P>
 The local S&L industry was helped by the recovering economy, he said, because 
real estate values have stabilized.  
</P>
<P>
 Only seven of the county's S&Ls were profitable, and they were led by the two 
largest -- American Savings Bank in Irvine and Household Bank in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 American, with $17.3 billion in loans and other assets, earned $21.6 million. 
Household, with $8.6 billion in assets, earned $37.9 million. Downey, the 
third-largest with $3.7 billion in assets, reported the third-highest profit, 
$6.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine county thrifts lost money, led by troubled Union Federal Savings Bank, 
which lost $9.8 million. Plaza Home Mortgage Bank in Santa Ana, a mortgage 
banking operation hurt by the rise in rates, lost $8.7 million. Last month, 
Plaza's parent company agreed to sell the thrift in a $120-million deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Guardian Savings & Loan in Huntington Beach, which failed and was sold in July 
by regulators, lost $4.8 million.

FORMER KEATING AIDE TO BE SENTENCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>

 Judy J. Wischer, the former top aide to imprisoned Lincoln Savings & Loan 
defrauder Charles H. Keating Jr., will be sentenced Monday in federal court for 
her role in the 1989 failure of the Irvine thrift. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors won't say yet what kind of sentence they are recommending 
for Wischer, but her attorney, Donald C. Randolph, who is seeking probation for 
her, said that he was pleased with the prosecution's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 He said she provided "extraordinary cooperation" to the U.S. attorney's 
office, the FBI, the U.S. Office of Thrift Supervision, the Resolution Trust 
Corp. and the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The RTC said that her aid led to the recovery of $80 million, which is part of 
$280 million that the agency recovered in civil actions against those who 
worked for Keating or his American Continental Corp. in Phoenix. Keating was 
chairman of now-defunct American Continental, Lincoln's parent company, and 
Wischer was president. 
</P>
<P>
 Wischer, along with other top aides and an array of outside professionals, 
helped Keating loot Lincoln and bilk nearly 22,000 American Continental 
investors, including about 17,000 Southern Californians, of more than $285 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Wischer, who was indicted with Keating and others in both state and federal 
courts, pleaded guilty in 1992 to bank and securities fraud and agreed to 
testify against Keating in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
 By that time, Keating, 70, already had been convicted of securities fraud in 
state court and sentenced to 10 years in prison. But Wischer was the key 
witness against him at his federal racketeering and conspiracy trial. He was 
convicted in federal court as well and sentenced to 12 years, seven months in 
prison, which he is serving concurrently with the state term.

 Luther Medical Products Inc.: The Tustin-based company on Friday rejected an 
earlier, unsolicited acquisition bid by MedChem Products Inc. as "inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
 Luther, which on Sept. 15 reported receiving MedChem's $3.50 to $4 per share 
bid, determined during a Friday board meeting that the offer "would not be in 
the best interest of our shareholders," said David Rollo, Luther president and 
chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 MedChem in Woburn, Mass., which competes with Luther Medical in certain parts 
of the catheter market, had offered a combination of cash and MedChem stock. In 
September, MedChem set the price of its unsolicited offer at $9.8 million to 
$11.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 MedChem also said that the deal would let MedChem take advantage of "natural 
synergies" between Luther and MedChem's San Antonio, Tex.-based Gesco catheter 
subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 Luther's shares fell 6.25 cents to $3.31 in Nasdaq trading Friday. While the 
stock has been hovering under $4 in recent months, Luther traded as high as $10 
in 1992. The company recently reported a $961,923 loss on revenue that was down 
18% to $2.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30.

 Cherry Textron: The Santa Ana firm has announced that it will move about 150 
jobs in its commercial automotive operations to North Carolina over the next 
two years to reduce the costs of shipping its parts to car factories in Ohio, 
Michigan and Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Kanda, Cherry's director of human resources, said Friday that the 
company does not yet know how many workers will be offered transfers to North 
Carolina. It hopes to expand its aerospace work at the plant to absorb 
employees who wish to remain, he said.

A TENOR FOR THE TIMES; WOLFGANG SCHMIDT BRINGS POWER AND PASSION TO 
'TANNHAUSER' IN THE SAN FRANCISCO OPERA PRESENTATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hats off, gentlemen. A Tannhauser. The real, irrational thing. 
</P>
<P>
 His name is Wolfgang Schmidt. Bayreuth knows him as Siegfried. The Met has 
seen him as Bacchus. At the War Memorial Opera House on Thursday, he proved 
that the bona fide Wagnerian tenor may not be as rare as the dodo bird after 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmidt is not an absolute paragon. Contrary to Richard Wagner's prescription, 
he is human. He forces for impact once in a while, and his tone sometimes 
tightens under pressure. In context, it hardly matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a singer who has all the basic goods, and, for the most part, uses 
them with rare skill, imposing fervor and affecting theatricality. Here, at 
last, is a Germanic hero who looks like a Germanic hero (in opera, everything 
is relative), and, more important, sounds like one. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner certainly wasn't kind to any of his protagonists, but he may have been 
least kind to this one. The composer demanded that his minstrel knight command 
leather lungs, endless stamina, the touch of a poet, expressive ardor and a top 
register that can sustain fervor throughout a four-hour marathon with the worst 
test coming at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 This, of course, was asking too much of a singing mortal, especially a male 
singing mortal who happens to have a high voice. But Schmidt, oddly underrated, 
rose honorably -- even poignantly -- to every challenge on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 He sang the introspective passages with something remarkably akin to bel-canto 
purity. He brought plangent power to the mighty outbursts. He enacted both the 
agonies and the ecstasies of the foolish hero with passionate conviction, and 
paced himself wisely. He actually made the treacherous Rome Narrative in the 
last act the overwhelming climax it should be, yet all too seldom is. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be wonderful to report that the San Francisco Opera mustered a new 
"Tannhauser" worthy of its new Tannhauser. No such luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Lotfi Mansouri, the beleaguered general director of the company, staged the 
sprawling masterpiece as if it were a dull museum piece. Gerard Howland, the 
resident designer, devised budget sets (partially recycled) that flip-flopped 
from silly stylization to vulgar symbolism to hoary pictorialism. Walter 
Mahoney provided costumes that suggested an indiscriminate raid on a musty 
warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The first act was amusing, at least, in its arcane corniness. The Venusberg 
turned out to be a glitzy showplace in which semi-nude (also quasi-nude) 
dancers wiggled through Vegas-vulgarity routines (choreographed by Michael 
Smuin) and struck soft-core porno poses amid lots of mirrors, a back-panel 
projection worthy of Neuschwanstein and quaintly ominous snake statuary. Oh, 
yes, I almost forgot. Venus and paramour were rolled on, reclining, literally, 
on a half shell. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder Tannhauser suffered the pangs of wanderlust. 
</P>
<P>
 From here, the director and designer took us to a painterly redwood forest in 
old Deutschland and thence to an outdoor hall of song that resembled bad window 
dressing at good old Macy's. Finally, it was back to the forest for a prosaic 
finale in which Wolfram sang his beloved ode to an invisible evening star. The 
proper illusions remained painfully elusive. 
</P>
<P>
 The musical values turned out to be more persuasive, thanks to Donald 
Runnicles' work in the seemingly understaffed pit. Conducting the Paris version 
of the score, he consistently stressed propulsion and lyricism that hark back 
to Meyerbeer. In the process, he slighted the massive grandeur and dramatic 
energy that preview coming Wagnerian attractions. It was a legitimate approach, 
however, and, in this limited context, it made good sense. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast, reasonably strong by current standards, was patently uneven. As the 
boringly saintly Elisabeth, Deborah Voigt often sounded glorious (better loud 
than soft) and looked like the operatic diva caricatured in all those unkind 
New Yorker cartoons. Catherine Keen mustered a pallid, vocally small-scaled 
counterforce as the should-be sultry Venus. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorma Hynninen, oddly stilted and somewhat monochromatic, brought much 
sensitivity if not much voice to the sanctimonious baritonal platitudes of 
Wolfram. Victor von Halem introduced a woolly, woofy, strangely muted basso as 
Landgraf Hermann. 
</P>
<P>
 The duties of the secondary knights were allotted to bland young journeymen. 
James Locke piped the song of the shepherd boy sweetly -- though not as sweetly 
as a girl-soprano can. The all-important chorus, trained by Ian Robertson, 
seemed drastically under-powered. 
</P>
<P>
 This, not incidentally, was San Francisco's first "Tannhauser" in 21 years. 
Perhaps things will be better in 2015. Hope springs internal. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Tannha user," presented by the San Francisco Opera at the War Memorial 
Opera House, 199 Grove St. (at Van Ness), San Francisco. Remaining performances 
Sunday at 1:30, Wednesday, Saturday and Nov. 2 at 7:30. Tickets $10 (standing

WHEN 1 + 1 DOESN'T ADD UP; BROOKS & DUNN MAY BE A DUO, BUT YOU CAN'T CALL THEM 
A REAL TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 What's the secret of the wildly successful country-music team of Brooks & 
Dunn? Simple. They aren't really a team at all. 
</P>
<P>
 During their 75-minute concert Thursday at the Greek Theatre, Kix Brooks and 
Ronnie Dunn functioned more like one of those picture-in-picture TV sets: twice 
as much to watch as single-picture models with no discernible impact on the 
quality of either program. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, for an act that just won its third straight award as top vocal duo 
from the Country Music Assn., they engaged in precious little two-part 
harmonizing. That makes Brooks & Dunn seem far less like a traditional musical 
duo than one band with two frontmen. 
</P>
<P>
 An advantage to the two-headed calf approach is that it gives fans two 
distinct looks and stage personas from which to choose: an average Joe who 
happily works his butt off to please (Brooks, who grimaced more with each antic 
gesture than the average member of the World Wrestling Federation); and a 
talented hunk with a beard who isn't afraid to show his romantic vulnerability 
(Dunn, who also is the better singer). 
</P>
<P>
 Truth be told, vulnerability of any stripe got short shrift in this show, one 
in their first full tour as headliners. The one time Dunn attempted 
heart-on-sleeve storytelling -- during the introduction to country's current 
No. 1 single, "She's Not the Cheatin' Kind" -- he was largely drowned out by 
his over-amped seven-man band. 
</P>
<P>
 That was one of just two slow songs in an uptempo 14-song set that treated 
ballads like speed bumps on a freeway. Dunn was quoted recently as saying that 
the reason they don't do more slow tunes is "it sounds kinda funny for two guys 
to be singing a ballad." 
</P>
<P>
 Would someone please send these guys a copy of the Everly Brothers' "Let It Be 
Me"?  
</P>
<P>
 Still, songs with emotional substance are scattered over B&D's three 
blockbuster albums -- the latest of which, "Waitin' on Sundown," made its debut 
last week at No. 1 on Billboard's country chart. But none found its way into 
the "Boot Scootin' Boogie" boys' live show. Apparently the primary goal was 
generating adrenaline, in the hope that all the flashing lights, throbbing 
beats and high-decibel guitars would fill the hole where the show's heart 
should be. 
</P>
<P>
 Martina McBride's opening set was as superficially attractive as the 
air-brushed photos on her album covers. The only emotionally provocative moment 
came with her final number, Gretchen Peters' "Independence Day" (the video of 
which McBride recently picked up the CMA's video of the year award).  
</P>
<P>
 Before leaving the stage, the pixieish singer politely thanked the cheering 
crowd "for believing in that song as much as I do" -- a song, as it happens, 
that lionizes a woman who escapes an abusive marriage by torching her house, 
with her husband still inside. A token lyrical stance of moral neutrality ("I 
ain't sayin' it's right or it's wrong") is feeble compensation for this 
celebration of murder, no matter how unsympathetic the victim may be.

A LOT HAS CHANGED IN A YEAR FOR CBS; TELEVISION: RATINGS NEWS FOR THE NETWORK 
ISN'T ALL BAD, BUT THE KILLER IS THAT IT'S DEAD LAST IN THE CONTEST FOR VIEWERS 
18 TO 49 YEARS OLD. 
</P>

<P>
 The reign of CBS as the nation's most popular TV network has suddenly taken a 
sharp turn for the worse, despite "Murphy Brown," "Murder, She Wrote" and "60 
Minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 These aging series -- and David Letterman's show -- are just about the only 
regular night-time programs with real clout on CBS, according to ratings 
released this week for the first month of the 1994-95 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Letterman -- who used to carve up his old boss, NBC owner General Electric -- 
is now using his stiletto on his new employer, CBS, through some choice Top 10 
lists. For instance, his "New CBS Promotional Slogans" included: "Where's the 
remote control?" and "The shows are funnier if you're drunk." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was another Top 10 list, "Ways CBS Can Improve Its Prime-Time 
Ratings." Some suggestions: "Make 'Murder, She Wrote' topless" and "Create a 
new show about a family that sits down to watch ABC show." 
</P>
<P>
 ABC has won the ratings three of the first four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 With a noticeable lack of sizzle in its programming, CBS -- after three years 
atop the pack, and the only network ever to jump from last place to first -- 
has been heading from the penthouse back toward the basement.  
</P>
<P>
 It's still early in the season, of course; CBS actually finished first one 
week and theoretically could come through in the stretch again. But what's 
missing thus far is more than ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas things are popping at the other networks -- with NBC's new medical 
drama "ER" and its sitcom "Frasier" creating word-of-mouth, and ABC's "Home 
Improvement" and "NYPD Blue" leading a pack of high-profile hits -- CBS is 
definitely not the talk of the town, except for revived rumors about how its 
dropping ratings and profits are making it more vulnerable for a takeover, and 
for a considerably lower price. 
</P>
<P>
 The cold statistics, as of the latest weekly ratings, show that CBS is 
actually just three-tenths of a point behind leader ABC and two-tenths behind 
surprising NBC. But the killer for CBS is that it is dead last -- way behind 
ABC and trailing even Fox -- in the competition for viewers 18 to 49 years of 
age, whom advertisers prize. CBS targets a slightly older market but would 
dearly like to make inroads with younger viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 How is CBS management reacting to Letterman's barbs? 
</P>
<P>
 "They have the brains to keep quiet about it," says Letterman's co-executive 
producer, Robert Morton. "I think they take it very well -- because they're 
ahead (with Letterman's show). God forbid they weren't ahead. I don't think 
they'd take it that well." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Peter Lassally, also co-executive producer for Letterman: "There've been 
no complaints. They feel badly for us. The prime-time lead-ins don't give us 
the boost we need." 
</P>
<P>
 CBS spokesman Tom Goodman, speaking for network management, says of 
Letterman's needling: "That's what makes Dave Dave . Everybody's fair game. 
Sometimes it's more fun when he's making fun of other people, but it's all part 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Says CBS' chief programmer, entertainment president Peter Tortorici: "If I'm 
unable to laugh at myself, I ought to find another line of work. None of us 
here are that thin-skinned." 
</P>
<P>
 But, as Morton says, "the lead-ins we've been getting are frightening -- from 
prime time and local news." 
</P>
<P>
 Tortorici acknowledges CBS' nose-dive in generating viewer excitement: "Our 
problem is that we aren't putting on big signature shows -- shows that people 
are talking about. We came into this season hoping that 'Chicago Hope' (a 
medical series) would do this for us, but I have no less confidence in it than 
I did in 'Picket Fences.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "ER" clobbered "Chicago Hope" in head-on competition, and the CBS series was 
moved. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest place we have to push," says Tortorici, "is the half-hour comedy 
area. We haven't had a monster comedy since 'Murphy Brown' years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 While he touts such CBS sitcoms as "The Nanny" and "Dave's World," he also 
acknowledges that "they haven't shown the kind of clout that a 'Home 
Improvement' or a 'Frasier' has." 
</P>
<P>
 But, says Tortorici, CBS is preparing to roll out this season a number of 
situation comedies that he hopes will make a difference for the network. Among 
the shows he cites are: 
</P>
<P>
 "Cybill," starring Cybill Shepherd as a divorced woman in her 40s with two 
daughters; "Under the Hood," with George Wendt (Norm on "Cheers") as a garage 
owner who has a radio show about cars; "Double Rush," about bicycle messengers 
in New York City; and "Women of the House," starring Delta Burke as a woman who 
inherits her late husband's congressional seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Also: "The Office," a workplace comedy with Valerie Harper, and "Heavens to 
Betsy," the tentative title of a series with Dolly Parton as a woman who 
returns to her hometown after not quite achieving the success she sought as a 
singer. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless CBS does a major turnaround, Letterman may find himself in the position 
that Johnny Carson did at NBC when it was in a severe slump -- virtually 
carrying the network with his late-night show. CBS' successful grab of 
Letterman from NBC not only looks good now, but lucky, because he's suddenly 
TV's hottest property on a network that needs all the help it can get. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't take the necessary steps to rebuild our lineup, we will continue 
to slide," Tortorici concedes. "I saw it happen before, and I'm not going to 
let it happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 It will be tough. On Tuesdays, for instance, where CBS used to weigh in 
powerfully with weekly movies, the competition now includes "Home Improvement," 
"Frasier," "Grace Under Fire" and "NYPD Blue." Says Tortorici: "The landscape 
has changed." CBS' head of TV movies and miniseries left the network this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Murder, She Wrote," meanwhile, is CBS' only Top 10 entertainment series this 
season. That says it all. 
</P>

 Sign Here: Sharon Stone has sealed a deal to develop and produce "Doctor, 
Lawyer, Indian Chief," according to a spokesman at New Line Cinema. The 
romantic comedy is about a surgeon sued for malpractice who must enlist her 
ex-husband, a medical malpractice lawyer, to defend her. It will be produced 
through Stone's Chaos Productions in a joint effort with her manager, Chuck 
Binder. Stone is currently shooting "Casino" in Las Vegas with director Martin 
Scorsese and co-star Robert De Niro. "Doctor, Lawyer, Indian Chief" will begin 
filming sometime next year for a 1996 release. MUSIC

 'Rangers' Returns: "The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers," the highest-rated kids' 
TV show in America, will be reinstated in the schedules of Scandinavian 
broadcaster TV3 later this year. The show was pulled from the airwaves in 
Norway after a 5-year-old girl was beaten and left to freeze to death by her 
playmates. Scandinavian broadcasters believe the killing was linked to the 
show, and TV3 removed all action-oriented children's programming. "From the 
information available at this time, no direct or indirect linkage between this 
event and any children's telecast in Scandinavia has been established," said 
Barry Stagg, vice president of Saban Entertainment, the "Power Rangers" 
producer. "Although our show has no direct linkage in this grievous occurrence, 
we remain deeply saddened by this tragedy."

 Reynolds Loses It: Apparently Cynthia Robbins, a reporter from the San 
Francisco Examiner, asked Burt Reynolds the wrong question during an interview 
this week. Asked about a divorce court hearing, Reynolds, on tour to promote 
his book, "My Life," lost his temper and, according to Robbins' account 
published Friday, "grabbed my reporter's sheet of questions, crumpled it into a 
little ball and ripped my reporter's notepad. Then he took my hand and shook 
it, squeezing my fingers as hard as he could, and literally shoved me out the 
door." Robbins said she is considering pressing charges. Reynolds has canceled 
the rest of his national book tour and returned to his home in Florida.

RIGHTS PANEL HEARS TESTIMONY ON TV NEWSROOM BIAS; PROBE: PREFERENCE GOES TO 
WHITE MALE REPORTERS AND STORIES STEREOTYPE MINORITIES, SOME PARTICIPANTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre, former KNBC-TV Channel 4 news 
anchor Carla Aragon and representatives from various advocacy groups are among 
those who told a civil rights advisory committee that local television 
newsrooms discriminated against minority employees while perpetuating 
stereotypes in their news coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The testimony came during a forum held Thursday and Friday in Pasadena by the 
California Advisory Committee of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, which is 
investigating employment issues in the local TV news business. Commission 
officials said the hearing was the first of several it will hold to explore 
hiring and promotion opportunities for minorities and women. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearings are an outgrowth of an ongoing investigation by the Western 
regional office of the Civil Rights Commission, which started looking at local 
television newsrooms after Alatorre and minority employees at several stations 
-- particularly KCBS-TV Channel 2 and KNBC -- complained that white male 
reporters were being given preferential treatment because of their race. 
</P>
<P>
 Alatorre told the 17-member committee that since he filed a complaint with the 
commission last March, "the issue has grown in magnitude. Race and sex 
discrimination in the Los Angeles television market is an all-encompassing and 
serious problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The councilman also charged local news executives with negative coverage of 
minority communities, with many stories "distorted by biased and institutional 
racism." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Aragon, who worked as a reporter and anchor at KNBC for 10 1/2 years, 
delivered many of the forum's most gripping moments when she described how her 
feeling of mistreatment by news officials caused her to quit earlier this year 
and take a lower-paying anchor position in Albuquerque, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the kind of thing where Latino reporters are doing a great job but not 
getting credit for it," Aragon said. "Some sort of monitoring of the practices 
by these stations needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Aragon said she felt that discrimination by KNBC management played a key role 
in the exit of five Latino reporters and anchors during a period of less than 
five months covering late last year and early this year. She noted that the 
executives with whom she and the other Latinos had clashed -- news director 
Mark Hoffman and general manager Reed Manville -- have since left the station. 
</P>
<P>
 Management from the local television stations will be asked to testify and 
give their responses to the allegations when the commission schedules a second 
series of hearings within 60 to 90 days.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; PARTY ATMOSPHERE COMES WITH THE SPECIALS' DELIVERY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 England's Specials headed the ska revival of the late '70s and early '80s, 
playing the pulsing Jamaican style with a harder edge that reflected the U.K.'s 
simultaneous punk rock movement. The fresh take on this pre-reggae genre 
spurred a whole slew of new like-minded bands such as the Selecter and Madness, 
and also begat a new generation of Mods, with their natty suits, ties and motor 
scooters. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's been a good 10 years since the Specials went the way of skinny ties 
and pointy shoes, so the band's show Thursday at the Palace seemed somewhat of 
a gamble. It took half a set for the band to get the audience truly skanking 
(the angular dance that looks sort of like mechanized skipping) but, 
ultimately, the Specials delivered just what old-time fans wanted: a familiar 
party atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 The band, which boasts of four of its original seven members, first boomed 
dubby ballads and then pumped out more upbeat dance numbers. Neville Staples 
and Roddy Byers sang with sleepy, reggae-ish cadences and in tough, rude boy 
monotones. The songs -- including the classics "A Message to You Rudy" -- came 
through clean and tight, with the audience singing along en masse. 
</P>
<P>
 Though they seem somewhat irrelevant now, the Specials were still able to 
deliver high-energy and hard-hitting ska, no apologies required. LORRAINE ALI

JAZZ REVIEW; CARTER PUTS ON A UNIQUE, SPECIAL SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OK, here's fair warning. Benny Carter is making an extremely rare appearance 
at Catalina Bar & Grill through Sunday. Miss him, and you'll miss one of the 
great opportunities to experience the heart and soul of jazz music. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's put that in context. At 87, Carter is one of the grand old men of jazz. 
In the early 1930s -- when Charlie Parker was barely a teen-ager -- Carter and 
Johnny Hodges laid down the archetypal definitions of excellence for the jazz 
alto saxophone. Oh, and he played first-rate trumpet, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this would have much more than historical significance if Carter were 
in his musical dotage. But the performance he delivered in his opening set 
Thursday night before an enthusiastic, overflow crowd needed no explanations or 
qualifiers. Very simply, Carter played a deliciously appealing collection of 
tunes with the elegant style of a musical master. 
</P>
<P>
 The material was mostly familiar stuff -- "Misty," "Take the 'A' Train" -- 
along with an original, "Another Time, Another Place." With Carter, however, 
tunes are the starting points for spontaneous composition. Like the mature 
Picasso, he has a magisterial perspective that allows him to seek out the 
creative center of his work, while still retaining the skills with which to 
communicate his vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of Carter's improvisations was a study in musical constructionism. Taking 
bits and pieces of melody, he turned them around, repeating fragments here, 
altering them there, and gradually assembling them into colorful variants on 
the original songs. Although his tone was a bit pinched in places, and he 
occasionally had to squeeze out some of the higher harmonics, his total 
performance was superb, a unique and special treat. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter was accompanied by the very able team of Larry Nash, piano; Larance 
Marable, drums, and Larry Gales, bass. Nash produced an especially vigorous 
flow of chords, and Marable -- as always -- was strong and subtle. In addition 
to providing a firm, walking rhythm foundation, Gales also stepped forward for 
an engaging, bowed bass feature on "I'm Getting Sentimental Over You." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Benny Carter Quartet at Catalina Bar & Grill, 1640 N. Cahuenga Blvd., 
Hollywood. (213) 466-2210. Carter plays two sets each night, at 9 and 11, 
through Sunday. $17 cover for the early show, $15 for the late show, with 
two-drink minimum.

CRAVEN'S 'NIGHTMARE' FINALLY GETS RESPECT; MOVIES: HORROR FILM WAS A SURPRISE 
HIT OF THE TORONTO FEST LAST MONTH, SHOWING THERE IS QUALITY IN THE GENRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 All is not dark at the Wes Craven manse. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, there's the Poe-esque faux owl on the terrace peering icily over 
Craven's sweeping view of Nichols Canyon. And a very stuffed Rex greeting you 
at the door, in memory of his deadly canine performance in "The People Under 
the Stairs." Not to mention such rarefied coffee-table fare as "The History of 
Hell." 
</P>
<P>
 But at the fairly adult age of 55, Wes Craven is finding a certain sunniness 
to this horror movie business, which has consumed him since he stumbled onto it 
nearly 30 years ago. It has to do with the fact that after lo these many years, 
Craven has finally given up bloodying his toes, as he puts it, "kicking against 
the pricks, as Saint Paul said. I think it means, literally kicking against the 
thorns. It's hard to kick against something that's obviously not meant to be 
kicked against. You should accept it.  
</P>
<P>
 "And the fact that I make horror films, there's always been a part of me that 
has always agreed with the worst of my critics, that this is a terrible thing 
to be doing. At a certain point, it's like, why? You speak to an audience. You 
express a legitimate part of yourself and of humanity. Why look down on it 
yourself? Just love it." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, his latest film, "Wes Craven's New Nightmare," is something of a 
horror movie manifesto, declaring that yes, Virginia, there is quality in the 
genre, distinct from the masses of exploitation films and sequels that give 
scary movies a creepy name. Paradoxically, it's also a sequel of sorts itself, 
as the seventh vehicle for Craven's creation, Freddy Krueger, the monster 
behind the half-a-billion-dollar phenomenon known as "Nightmare on Elm Street." 
</P>
<P>
 But the latest $11-million movie doesn't just resurrect Freddy, who met his 
maker a sequel ago in "Freddy's Dead: The Last Nightmare" (1991). It redefines 
him -- he's bigger, darker and more ancient -- and it reinvents the Freddy 
genre, busting it out of its largely adolescent prison into sophisticated adult 
fare that toys with various levels of reality. The result was the surprise hit 
of the Toronto Film Festival last month and winner of a Golden Scroll of 
Outstanding Achievement from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror 
Films. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so glad people are loving this movie," says actor Robert Englund, the man 
behind Freddy's claw. "I don't feel I have to defend the genre anymore. He's 
taken it to this whole other place. It's almost like 'Nightmare on Elm Street' 
has been crossed with Robert Altman's 'The Player.' It's a movie within a movie 
within a dream." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The premise is that the ancient evil that Freddy represents has vaulted the 
fourth wall, crossing over from film into the reality of the filmmakers' lives. 
There and in the realms of nightmare and film -- society's collective dreams -- 
the uber Freddy wreaks havoc that jibes with Craven's own nightmares. 
</P>
<P>
 In a scene with Freddy's first nemesis, actress Heather Langenkamp of the 
first and third "Nightmare" movies, Craven, playing himself, explains that 
Freddy was able to invade their lives because the story has passed away in 
sequel-land, becoming too familiar and watered down: "When the story dies, the 
evil is set free." 
</P>
<P>
 Death may be Craven's handmaiden, but not dead scripts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always annoyed me that many newspapers have called me the Guru of Gore, 
the Sultan of Slash and Slashmeister," he says in a soft voice, seated in the 
airy living room the twice-divorced filmmaker shares with two cats and a dog.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've always tried to put a great deal of thought into my films. . . . I think 
most genres have 90% crap and 10% where people put their hearts into it. But in 
genre films, it hits you over the head -- no pun intended -- if they're really 
bad. Also, different criteria come into play in horror films. There's an area 
they get into that's almost unrecognizable as art to most people, where they're 
dealing with things almost Dionysian. And sometimes it's not a rational 
statement at all that's being made . . . about energy and rage.  
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I think you have to bring a whole different set of criteria to 
genre films, and most people aren't willing to do that. They're different 
critters many times. It deals with the painful. It deals with the verboten, the 
unspeakable. The insides of our bodies are released in ways that we're not 
prepared to contemplate. Our own mortality is depicted mostly simply by blood 
and guts. It's offensive to be reminded of the fragility of the human shell." 
</P>
<P>
 Born into a fundamentalist family in Cleveland, Craven stumbled onto the genre 
after being miscast as a humanities professor at Clarkson College in Potsdam, 
N.Y. Craven's first film, "Last House on the Left" (1972), which he made with 
Sean Cunningham ("Friday the 13th"), was so vilified for its gore and violence 
that audiences stormed projection booths and projectionists cut the movie 
themselves after the filmmakers released it with a phony R rating. The film was 
a brutal and realistic depiction of kidnaping, rape and murder, and the 
experience pushed Craven into the realm of metaphor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The first film was so painful, the emotions and situations were so real . . . 
I started to have a real feeling like if I don't get more abstract about this, 
I'm prostituting myself or exploiting real feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 Craven's most successful metaphor was Freddy, who wrested the filmmaker from 
cult obscurity when "Nightmare on Elm Street" debuted 10 years ago (also 
introducing then-unknown Johnny Depp). He withdrew from the first "Nightmare" 
sequel because he didn't like the script, returning only for "Nightmare on Elm 
Street 3: Dream Warriors" (1987), as a writer. 
</P>
<P>
 But even though Craven was Freddy's creator, he enjoyed little of the enormous 
profits stemming from films by other directors. He'd signed away his rights to 
sequels, and after nearly eight years of wrangling, Craven reportedly recovered 
$400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that when it went public, things started to improve somewhat," he 
says. "I started to get accountings and then when (New Line Cinema founder and 
chairman) Bob (Shaye) called me and he mentioned that he'd heard over the years 
that I had various complaints . . . indeed, most of it was rectified in 
relatively short order." 
</P>
<P>
 Craven says the days when his presence thinned out dinner parties are long 
behind him, and his growing acceptance helped net him his next project, 
"Vampire in Brooklyn," which will begin shooting next month with Eddie Murphy 
in the eponymous role. 
</P>
<P>
 But horror films have also posed a thorny problem for Craven -- he can't break 
out of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It so far has proved impossible to get those projects (outside the genre)," 
he says. "You say the name Wes Craven, what does that bring into your mind? 
It's a town of hiring specialists. There are some directors that do different 
kinds of films, but it's more the exception than the rule . . . which is 
unfortunate. It stifles the possible development of larger-scale artists in our 
culture because they don't get a chance to grow in other areas." 
</P>
<P>
 'It's always annoyed me that many newspapers have called me the Guru of Gore, 
the Sultan of Slash and Slashmeister.'

'SATURDAY NIGHT' NOT SO LIVE AND WELL, CRITICS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 While Conan O'Brien has been picking up some support from TV critics this 
season, another NBC late-night series has been drawing Bronx cheers in its 20th 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Over a critical review of the show, Newsweek put this headline: "Dear 
'Saturday Night Live': It's Over.Please Die." And this week's Entertainment 
Weekly says, "Sitting at home and crying might not be your idea of a fun 
Saturday night, but it can't get any sadder than the new season of 'SNL.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The barbs notwithstanding, no changes are planned, according to NBC late-night 
chief Rick Ludwin and Lorne Michaels, executive producer of both "Saturday 
Night Live" and O'Brien's "Late Night."  
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, it hurts to read reviews like that," Michaels said. "But as in 
some seasons in the past, I think this is a transition year for us. I believe 
the new performers and writers we've added will work out well over the season. 
Last week's show -- with John Travolta as host -- was a good one." 
</P>
<P>
 Some sources said NBC executives had been feeling earlier this year that 
Michaels, who also produces theatrical films, was not paying enough attention 
to "SNL," and they met with him last spring to voice their concerns. But, said 
Michaels, "there is no one more interested in the future of this show than I 
am." JANE HALL

O'BRIEN GROWING INTO 'LATE NIGHT'; TELEVISION: THE SHOW HAS BEEN RENEWED 'WELL 
INTO 1995,' BOASTS IMPROVED RATINGS AND THE HOST WHO TOOK OVER LETTERMAN'S SPOT 
A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO IS SETTLING IN.

<P>
 Stretching out his long legs in his office after a taping of "Late Night," 
Conan O'Brien doesn't look insecure about the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still in my childhood phase," he says jokingly. "You know how a child 
measures his life, saying proudly, 'I'm 5 1/2 years old!'? Well, I'm 1 year and 
3 months old with this show. I doubt if Johnny Carson measured his tenure that 
way. But when you consider the number of shows that have come and gone in the 
past year, I think it's an achievement to be here, with a show that's improving 
in its comedy and doing better in the ratings." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost from the time that O'Brien, 31, a former comedy writer who was unknown 
as a performer, was chosen to succeed David Letterman as NBC's 12:35 a.m. host, 
someone somewhere has been predicting that the show would soon be canceled. 
Most recently there have been rumors that the network was considering dropping 
"Late Night" and expanding Greg Kinnear's "Later," which now follows it at 1:35 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 But this week NBC, which has been renewing O'Brien's show in 13-week cycles, 
again extended the run. Although the network declined to be more specific than 
"well into 1995," sources said that "Late Night" will be around at least until 
February. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see improvement in both the quality and the ratings for Conan's show," 
said Rick Ludwin, NBC's late-night programming chief. "That's why we've renewed 
the show." 
</P>
<P>
 With a 1.9 average rating for the third quarter of this year (representing 
about 1.8 million households), "Late Night's" ratings have improved 15% in the 
last year. It is also averaging a 1.9 rating so far this fall, compared to a 
1.2 for its newest competition, the syndicated "Jon Stewart Show." David 
Letterman's ratings for the last year he was on "Late Night" averaged a 2.6, 
according to NBC.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the improvement, some of NBC's affiliated stations remain unhappy with 
O'Brien's ratings, believing they could reap larger profits by offering 
syndicated programming in that time period. Several threatened to drop the 
network show earlier this year, but NBC has held the line, and only Houston has 
done so, replacing "Late Night" with the show business newsmagazine "Extra." 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole late-night landscape has changed, putting new pressure on shows," 
Ludwin acknowledged. "There are a number of affiliates -- some of them the same 
affiliates who felt this way about David Letterman several years ago -- who 
feel that Conan's show is not performing to the ratings level they want. 
There's no make-or-break number, but we need to see ratings improvement in a 
timely manner, and we'll be taking a good look at the November sweeps to see 
how the show is doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed -- because more competition is around the corner. In December or 
January, CBS will launch a talk show with Tom Snyder to follow Letterman at 
12:35 a.m. -- although "we think he will attract an older audience," Ludwin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the important thing is that the show is going to be on the air at 
least for several more months," said "Late Show" executive producer Lorne 
Michaels. "I think we'll be around a year from now." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, O'Brien said that he is aware of the ratings. "But I believe the 
best thing I can do is to focus on the show itself," he added. "We seem to be 
connecting with an audience who like what we're doing and, hopefully, more 
people will hear about us and watch us as the show grows. If I went out there 
and tried to do a show that I thought would get a rating and didn't try ideas 
-- like having an ostrich deliver the lineup of our next night's show -- I'd 
think later, 'If only we'd tried that ostrich bit -- I would've been 
successful.' " 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien, a former writer on "The Simpsons" and "Saturday Night Live," Michaels 
and producer Jeff Ross have assembled a young writing staff, led by former 
"SNL" writer Robert Smigel, that has been winning praise recently from TV 
critics and others. O'Brien and Letterman have traded appearances on each 
other's shows, and Letterman remarked on the air at one point, "The more I 
watch the show, I realize you guys do an incredible amount of comedy, and the 
stuff that is produced is very high level." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few weeks, the comedy segments have ranged from a Ken Burns-style 
historical documentary on O'Brien's early years to "auditions" by computerized 
celebrities, from Michael Jackson to Jimmy Carter, to be jurors in the O.J. 
Simpson murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien, who was nervous when he began interviewing guests a year ago, now 
comfortably trades jokes with a range of guests, from rock singer Cheryl Crowe 
to Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.). And sidekick Andy Richter, whose deadpan style was 
criticized when the show began, now has a cult following of fan-club members 
who come to the taping every Friday night. Many college students (whose TV 
viewing in dorms is not measured in the Nielsen ratings) write in that they are 
fans of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a Plan B," O'Brien said. "I've always wanted to be a talk-show 
host and, remarkably, I've been given that opportunity. At some point you have 
to just figure it's 'Field of Dreams': If you build good comedy, they will 
come."

IN THE LOOP; IN THE '50S, JEAN MACLYMAN LATCHED ONTO MAKING HOOKED RUGS FROM 
RECYCLED RAGS. ALTHOUGH INTENDED TO BE STRICTLY PRACTICAL, THEIR BEAUTY HAS 
SURVIVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARESSA ARCHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Walking into the Maclyman house in Seal Beach is to step back to a time when 
everything in a home was used until it was completely worn out. To a time when 
recycling old things was seen as a financial necessity, not as a way to save 
the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 But, without Jean Maclyman there to explain, a visitor would never know that 
the picture hanging over the fireplace and the artwork dominating the living 
room wall were made from old clothing. Or that the antiques throughout the 
house were thrift store finds purchased when her family was young and new 
furniture was costly. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture, the wall hanging and many of the rugs throughout the house were 
hand-hooked by Maclyman, 77, when her children were young. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband was a Long Beach policeman and worked nights when he first started 
out. I started (hooking rugs) at night, after I put the children to bed, to 
keep from worrying about him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 That was during the early '50s, when Maclyman could buy wool coats at thrift 
stores for less than 50 cents and tear them into strips that would eventually 
become hooked rugs, pillows, pictures and chair seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The 8-by-10-foot rug that now hangs on the living room wall took Maclyman two 
years to complete. When her children were growing up, it was the rug under the 
dining room table.  
</P>
<P>
 "When Mom moved in here with me, I just couldn't see that rug being walked on 
anymore. It's too precious a work of art," said Maclyman's 47-year-old 
daughter, Jean. 
</P>
<P>
 The two women share their house with Jean's 7-year-old son, Patrick, who 
understands that his grandmother handmade many of the treasures that fill the 
home. When he told his neighborhood friends that a newspaper was running a 
story about his grandmother's hooked rugs, they wanted to come in and see them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I showed them around and told them about how I made the rugs," said Maclyman, 
soft-spoken and modest about her work. "I don't know if they were impressed, 
but they seemed interested." 
</P>
<P>
 It is hard not to be impressed by the more than a dozen rugs and other hooked 
items in the house. Even after decades of use, their colors are still vibrant, 
and they seem as unworn as if they were recently made. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The process of hooking a rug is not very complicated. Only a few materials are 
required: burlap or canvas for the backing, yarn or any kind of fabric, old or 
new, and a hook. 
</P>
<P>
 Rugs are made by pulling cloth through interstices in a backing. Many 
rug-makers prefer using a wooden frame to hold a piece in place as they work, 
though some simply rest their work in their laps. Maclyman said she used both 
practices but preferred a frame for large rugs. A quilting frame is what she 
used for the floral rug hanging in the living room. 
</P>
<P>
 Hooked rugs have been made in this country since its earliest days, although 
few of those pieces have survived. They were made with coarse yarn that could 
not be tightly woven; consequently, those rugs were not durable and didn't 
last. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1850s, hooked rugs were a common element in every home, probably due to 
cheap jute burlap imported from the Indies. Burlap is the most common backing 
used to hook rugs. Rugs made prior to the Civil War were either colored with 
dyes derived from natural sources or simply held the color of the rags from 
which they were made. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1860, burlap with printed patterns was available, making it possible for 
people who weren't good at drawing to hook rugs with intricate designs. 
</P>
<P>
 Most hooked rugs being sold today as floor coverings are made by machine and 
imported. The cost for a large, room-size rug made from wool can be $1,000 or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a growing market for antique hooked rugs, but many of the pieces 
on the market are machine-made rugs created in the 1930s, according to William 
C. Ketchum, who has written several books on hooked rugs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Maclyman's foray into pre-patterned rugs came after reading an article in The 
Times in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The article was by Dorothy Lawless, so I wrote to her, and she sent me burlap 
with a stamped pattern. We were still writing each other as late as the early 
'70s," Maclyman said. "I'd write to ask about getting the sky right in a hooked 
picture and such." 
</P>
<P>
 Maclyman said for her first rugs -- small area rugs she calls her "primitives" 
-- she drew the patterns freehand and used bold colors with no shading. She 
learned shading by taking a community class at a local high school.  
</P>
<P>
 "The art is really in the dyeing process. It would take hours. You dyed the 
material when it was still in big pieces, such as the sleeves or backs of 
coats," she said. "If you'd dye after cutting them into strips, you'd loose too 
much material from fraying." 
</P>
<P>
 To get the colors right, Maclyman would increase or decrease the amount of 
dye. "Also, the longer you left the fabric in, the darker it would be," she 
added. The fabric was then rinsed in salt water or vinegar to set the color. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember as a child coming into the kitchen, and my mom would have huge 
pots boiling on the stove to dye the cloth," says Maclyman's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Shading becomes important when hooking pictures or large rugs with intricate 
designs. 
</P>
<P>
 Maclyman points to the rug hanging on the living room wall to illustrate the 
importance of shading in creating large yet detailed designs. "There are 10 to 
15 shades of green and 10 shades of rose color from light pink to garnet. It 
took me one year to make the flowers and one year to make the background." 
</P>
<P>
 Cutting the fabric into strips to be used as yarn is also a time-consuming 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Maclyman used a rug cutter to make the strips for hooking. The cutter she used 
could be set at different widths. "If I was hooking a picture, though, I made 
the strips by hand to get them very fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Hooking rugs is still practiced but is now seen more as an art and less as a 
means to cover a bare floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's because back when my mom was doing this, women didn't usually 
have their own cars and stayed in the house a lot. They were very thrifty then; 
nothing ever was wasted," says Maclyman's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her skill in hooking rugs, Maclyman knitted most of her 
children's sweaters and made curtains and bedspreads. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she doesn't do as much craft work these days -- her other interests 
include ballroom dancing and swimming -- she says her rugs and the experience 
of making them will always be special. 
</P>
<P>
 She plans to help her daughter hook a rug for the hallway of their house. And, 
despite the fact that her rugs could command a hefty price from collectors, 
Maclyman says they're not for sale.

GARDENING; SEEING BULBS IN A NEW LIGHT; NO COLD NEEDED. PLANTS FROM 
MEDITERRANEAN OR SOUTH AFRICA WARM TO THE LOCAL CLIMATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN DARDICK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Poets haven't waxed lyrical about anemones and ixia the way they have some 
other bulb flowers, but for this climate, they're a better addition to the 
garden. 
</P>
<P>
 A visit to a local nursery now can tempt you with bushel baskets filled with 
plump bulbs and colorful photos of bright tulips and golden daffodils. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a tendency to pass by the odd-shaped "bulbs" with unfamiliar names 
such as anemone, ixia, sparaxis, tritonia and watsonia. Yet these plants can 
thrive year after year and produce an abundance of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tulips, daffodils, crocuses and hyacinths prefer cold climates. They need 
artificial chilling to force them into dormancy so they can bloom here. They 
can be grown only as annuals. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bulbs and bulb-like plants that hail from Mediterranean or South 
African climates thrive in the similar climate of Orange County. With the 
exception of narcissi and a very few strains of daffodils developed for warm 
climates, most bulbs last only one season here, because it just isn't cold 
enough here to give them the dormant period they need. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so with the bulbs, corms and rhizomes plants that hail from climates 
similar to ours. 
</P>
<P>
 Take watsonia. Originally native to South Africa, there are now more than 70 
species and hybrids. Grown from corms, they thrive in our region and produce 
tall flower spikes in fall or winter, when color is often sparse in the garden. 
It's excellent for naturalizing. 
</P>
<P>
 Watsonia is best planted in the middle or rear of a garden bed, because it 
reaches a height of four or five feet, with an equal spread. Several dwarf 
varieties were introduced recently, and they grow to a more demure height of 
two feet. Watsonia is available in white, orange, pink, rubra (reddish-pink), 
deep red and lavender. 
</P>
<P>
 Anemones stay in bloom in the garden for up to two months and hold up well as 
cut flowers for bouquets. However, many people tend to pass on planting 
anemones because the bulbs look like strange little rocks. It's almost 
impossible to detect stem from root section, so, when planting, place them 
sideways. Anemones prefer full sun but will also bloom when planted with 
afternoon sun or filtered light. Removing spent flowers (dead heading) will 
encourage the plants to produce more blooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Another good choice for this area is ranunculus. These tubers can repeat in 
future years if the soil has excellent drainage so the tubers don't rot away. 
Large tubers of these showy plants will produce abundant blooms throughout 
spring. Color selection ranges from white to orange, yellow, red, pink and 
picotee blends.  
</P>
<P>
 Select the largest tubers available and plant two inches deep, with the 
clawlike part of the tuber pointing down into the soil. Be sure soil is well 
worked and quick-draining. Water when first planting, then wait until green 
growth appears above the soil before watering again, about two weeks. If the 
Santa Anas begin to blow and the soil becomes very dry, water sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Davids, president of Davids and Royston Bulb Co., the West's largest 
wholesale supplier of bulbs, recommends freesias for fragrance, watsonia for 
height and tritonia for strong color in the garden and for cut flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We introduced tritonia to the market just four years ago, and they're really 
catching on," he said. "The strong solid colors and rigid stems make tritonia 
an excellent choice for bouquets and gardens." 
</P>
<P>
 Davids also recommends amaryllis, scilla and sparaxis as excellent choices for 
our warm climate. 
</P>
<P>
 In his opinion, if the right bulbs are chosen and a few basic preparations 
made, they're easy to grow in the garden or in containers. 
</P>
<P>
 With the right selection, you can expect to see your bulbs multiply in the 
garden for years to come, although Davids cautions that the term "naturalizing" 
in our climate really means a period of four or five years, because the soils 
in this region are contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have dirty soils that contain disease and viruses carried by aphids," 
Davids explained. "The problem is we over-water and over-fertilize, and this 
promotes disease." Bulb Planting Tips 
</P>
<P>
 Containers 
</P>
<P>
 Many bulbs can be grown successfully in pots. Select a good quality planting 
mix and place a handful of bulb fertilizer near the bottom. Add enough bulbs to 
create an attractive mass effect, and cover with planting mix. Water thoroughly 
and place in a sunny location. Water as planting mix dries out. 
</P>
<P>
 Once bulbs have finished blooming, withhold water and let the stems and leaves 
yellow and die. You may want to put the pots in a garage or basement while the 
plants are going through their natural decline and dormancy cycle. It's 
important to let the leaves yellow because this is how the plants store 
nutrients in the bulbs, corms or rhizomes for next year's bloom cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 Some bulbs can be forced into early bloom indoors where the temperatures are 
warm. Amaryllis and hyacinth will bloom in December or January indoors, months 
earlier than in the garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardens 
</P>
<P>
 Select sunny locations, work the soil and mix in sand or organic amendment to 
promote good drainage if the soil is heavy clay. Mix bulb fertilizer in the 
soil if you're planting large quantities, insert bulbs to the depth recommended 
for the particular variety, and cover. Water only as needed. If only a few 
bulbs are planted, place a handful of bulb fertilizer at the bottom of each 
planting hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Allow foliage to yellow and die back naturally. To camouflage the dying 
foliage, some gardeners braid the stems, roll them up and plant other plants 
nearby. Recommended Plants 
</P>
<P>
 Anemone. These poppy-shaped flowers come in many colors. Excellent for garden 
or bouquets. 
</P>
<P>
 Freesia. Highly fragrant. Hybrids vary in height from one to two feet; tubular 
flowers in colors including lavender, purple or blue. 
</P>
<P>
 Ixia. Easy to grow from corms; 18-inch flower spikes produced in May and June 
in colors ranging from white to yellow, orange, red, rose pink. 
</P>
<P>
 Scilla peruviana. Bulbs native to the Mediterranean region, they grow well in 
full sun or bright filtered light. Clusters of bluish-purple flowers emerge on 
one-foot stalks in May or June. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparaxis. Called the Harlequin Flower because the vividly colored blossoms are 
often blotched with contrasting colors. Plant corms in full sun, near the front 
of the border or bed. Plants reach a height of about one foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Tritonia. Closely related to freesia and ixia. Plant corms in full sun. 
Flowers are orange, red, salmon, yellow or apricot and are produced in 
spike-like clusters on rigid stems. Excellent cut flower. 
</P>
<P>
 Watsonia. Plant corms in full sun. Flowers produced on spikes like gladiolus, 
but smaller. Over several years, they form large clumps that die down in 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Zantedeschia (calla). Rhizomatous plants native to South Africa. The most 
common form is white. Newer hybrids are spotted, pastel, green or golden. Most 
thrive in spots that receive heavy water.

 Q. We bought some old oak captain's chairs at a garage sale last year. They 
look great but sound awful. Any time someone sits in them, they creak and 
groan. Is there a way to fix this without having them re-glued and finished? 
</P>
<P>
 S.A.,Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 A. There is a trick that might work for you, says Chris Macias of The Old Way 
Furniture Restoration in La Habra. When the chair gets old, the glue wears down 
and leaves gaps where the wood has become compressed. If the squeaking is 
coming from the legs, first hang the chair upside down. With an eye dropper or 
a syringe, squeeze some water into the joint while you wiggle the leg as much 
as you can, then set the chair in a warm, dry area. The wood in the joint 
should then re-expand into the gaps. If the squeaking is coming from the arms, 
do the same to that area. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't a long-term solution. Eventually you will have to have the chairs 
properly fixed. But it will probably soothe your nerves for now. 
</P>

 Q. I have a fiberglass shower that has become faded and scaly. Can I just 
paint this to improve the look? What kind of paint should be used? 
</P>
<P>
 T.T., Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 A. It's generally not a good idea to paint fiberglass, says Dan KramD Kitchen 
& Bath Design in Brea. Fiberglass needs to be redone with a gel-coat surface. 
The old surface has to be removed and the new one applied. Unless you're used 
to working with the materials, you're probably better off having a professional 
do the job. There are several companies that specialize in fiberglass 
refinishing. Just painting over the surface won't look very good.

 Q. We recently moved into a house that has a fairly new single-handled 
Price-Pfister faucet in the kitchen. It looks great, but when you turn the 
water on and take your hand off the handle, the handle drops down and turns the 
water off automatically, like it's too heavy for the faucet. Is this common in 
this brand of faucets? Is it a water-saving feature? How can I make the handle 
stay up? 
</P>
<P>
 C.F., Laguna Hills 
</P>
<P>
 A. Something is wrong with the faucet, says Ted Blanke of Central Plumbing & 
Heating in La Habra. If it's fairly new, it's probably an adjustment problem. 
Either the top bonnet isn't properly in place or the cartridge may be worn. 
Although in commercial applications you may see water-saving faucets that must 
be held to operate, those are not used for residences. 
</P>

<P>
 Q. About five years ago we put a wood floor in our kitchen and carefully moved 
our refrigerator out to lay the floor behind it. Now that we need a new 
refrigerator, we flinch when we think about having to pull this heavy old 
appliance across our pretty floor. How do the pros do it? 
</P>
<P>
 D.C., Buena Park 
</P>
<P>
 A. Usually, this is done with a heavy appliance dolly, says Tom Houlihan of 
Orange County Appliance Parts in Garden Grove. The refrigerator is pulled out 
of its space, the dolly fits in the side, and the unit is tilted and lifted up. 
You may want to lay some cardboard in front of the refrigerator and push it up 
on that. This will protect the floor from the unit's rollers, which may be 
sticky if you haven't moved it in five years. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q. I'd like to wallpaper the ceiling in my dining room, but it's an acoustic 
ceiling. Is there some kind of blank stock paper that can be used to hide the 
texture before I paper? 
</P>
<P>
 C.K., Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 A. Although blank stock can hide a great deal of wall texture, it's not likely 
to be effective on an acoustic ceiling, says Jim Grant of Dutch Boy Home 
Decorating Center in Santa Ana. The problem with papering over that kind of 
surface is that it's simply been sprayed onto the ceiling, so it's probably not 
going to hold the weight of your paper. The best answer is to have it removed. 
Take care to have your ceiling tested for asbestos before it's disturbed, 
though, so that it can be properly scraped.

 Bold strokes of gold adorn the glass platters of Projects, a New York-based 
collection by painter Franny O'Gorman. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking a rich, dramatic look, O'Gorman, a former photo stylist, achieves this 
effect with reverse gold-leaf, meaning applying it to the underside, which 
keeps her pieces functional. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not microwavable because of the gold, but you can serve food on them 
and wash them in the sink without worrying about losing its brilliance," said 
Serine Hastings, owner of the Loom Company, which represents O'Gorman and 14 
other artists. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Gorman, who attended the Kansas City Institute of Arts, hand-paints all of 
her pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her forest green and gold platter (about $120), O'Gorman has 
introduced "Falling Leaves" and a series of four "Seasons" pieces for fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Projects collection is available at a number of stores in Orange County. 
For the location nearest you, call The Loom Company at (212) 366-7214. STRIPE

 Even the bathroom deserves to have a distinctive look, say the designers of 
"Zebras" bath and shower accessories. Using original artwork created by a 
design studio in Lyon, France, Oxford Bath Products of Franklin, Ind., adapted 
the colors and patterns for use in bath furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
 The pattern brings a strong image from nature into a room that typically lacks 
lively contrasts.  
</P>
<P>
 Ceramic accessories such as a soap dish, toothbrush holder and water cup are 
available from $10 and up. There is also a wastebasket and tissue cover. The 
shower curtain (about $35) has a high-contrast border, and the main sheet 
features zebras on a taupe background. It is 70% polyester and 30% cotton. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Zebras" collection is carried at Three D Bed & Bath stores and other bath 
and specialty shops throughout Orange County. TABLE TIES 
</P>
<P>
 Strap-a-Tray connects to chairs and chaises to create a quick and portable 
table. 
</P>
<P>
 The lightweight tray, which has two straps, is secured via a hook and loop 
fastener similar to Velcro. The tray, which has cup and can depressions, fits 
on patio and deck furniture, across wheelchairs or between two chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The tray (about $11 plus shipping and handling) is the brainchild of Karsten 
Anderson of San Diego, who started his company, KPC, about 2 1/2 years ago. "I 
was tired of big business and wanted to start my own company, control my own 
destiny," said Anderson, 36, a former employee of General Dynamics.  
</P>
<P>
 "I needed an idea that was unique, plus it had to be self-funded. After much 
research, I came up with the tray," Anderson said. The vacuum-formed plastic 
tray is produced in San Diego.

ELECTRONICS; (GENTLY!) CARE AND FEEDING OF TEMPERAMENTAL VCR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are simple things you can do to extend the healthy life of your 
videocassette recorder. 
</P>
<P>
 First and foremost, take care to feed it properly. Before putting a tape in, 
use your fingers or a coin to turn the hub until the tape is pulled taut. Then 
load it into the machine gently to avoid breaking the gear teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 In some VCRs, gears cannot be replaced individually, so taking these 
precautions can prevent you from having to buy a whole new machine. 
</P>
<P>
 A VCR can also suffer damage if a tape breaks inside. Using the same section 
of tape over and over may weaken it and eventually cause it to snap. If you are 
in the habit of taping a show every day on the same tape, be sure to set the 
speed at SP, or standard play, which will cause the tape to wear more evenly. 
</P>
<P>
 Overusing reverse scan can also cause a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 One video repairman compares that feature to driving a car forward at 10 
m.p.h. and backward at 50 m.p.h. at the same time. The tension causes extreme 
wear and tear on the VCR and the tapes, which can be avoided if you rewind the 
tape, then forward scan to find what you are searching for. 
</P>
<P>
 When you are finished viewing a tape, remove it immediately. Leaving it in the 
VCR may cause it to stick inside, especially if there is a change in the heat 
or humidity. If that occurs, the recording elements may need to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 If you notice a haze visible over the programs you have taped, the recording 
elements probably are due for a cleaning. Wet and dry cleaners, equally 
effective, are available wherever you buy blank tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 However, be sure to follow instructions exactly. Using a dry cleaner for 
longer than recommended will have a sandpaper effect. If you choose a wet 
cleaner, let the VCR dry for at least 10 minutes before putting in a tape so it 
doesn't stick inside the machine. 
</P>
<P>
 If you use a cleaner twice and still notice the haze or other problems, take 
the machine in for a professional cleaning.

SAFETY; VALVE KEEPS WATER HEATER FROM BLOWING UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An improperly protected water heater is a problem found in a number of homes. 
</P>
<P>
 It needs to be addressed because live steam from the explosion of a tank-type 
water heater could cause severe damage or, if someone happened to be nearby at 
the time, serious injury or death. 
</P>
<P>
 All tank-type water heaters, whether they are electrically heated, gas fired 
or oil fired, must have a relief valve that is both temperature and pressure 
sensitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, many relief valves are pressure sensitive only, and this will 
not provide you with the needed protection against an explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the water heater's thermostat malfunction, the water in the tank could 
become superheated, meaning it's heated beyond the boiling point (212 degrees). 
</P>
<P>
 As the boiling point of water increases, its pressure increases, and both 
combined can weaken a tank and cause it to rupture, or simply exceed its yield 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Superheated water will instantly flash into steam, increase its volume and 
liberate an amount of energy that can be greater than a pound of nitroglycerin. 
</P>
<P>
 If the water had not been heated above 212 degrees, it would not flash into 
steam, and an explosion would be impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, pressure- and temperature-sensitive relief valves are designed 
to prevent the water temperature from exceeding 210 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 It does this by discharging the overheated water and allowing cooler water to 
enter the tank, safely lowering the temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also important that the BTU capacity of the relief valve exceed the BTU 
input of the water heater. If the capacity is less, the relief valve will not 
be able to discharge the overheated water at the same rate it's produced, 
resulting in an unsafe condition or possible explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Check the capacity of the relief valve on the nameplate mounted on the valve. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, look for the AGA (American Gas Assn.) rating given in BTU hours. 
This rating must exceed the BTU input to the water heater listed on the plate 
on the tank casing. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, when the relief valve is installed, its temperature-sensing element 
should be immersed in the top six inches of the water in the tank. 
</P>
<P>
 This is important because there is a temperature difference between the tank 
and the hot water outlet pipe. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, when the relief valve is installed in the hot water outlet pipe 
five inches away from the tank, the water in the tank could be raised to 250 
before the temperature at the relief valve reaches 210. 
</P>
<P>
 Installing a correct relief valve is important and is usually not too 
difficult or expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Once this is done, you don't have to worry about a water heater tank 
explosion.

WOODWORKING; THERE IS NO NEED TO GET FANCY TO MAKE JOINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Have you noticed that once a woodworker learns how to make tight-fitting 
dovetail joints, they begin to appear on everything? And mortise-and-tenon 
joints, once mastered, multiply like rabbits -- usually pinned and in full 
view. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodworkers aren't immune to the if-you've-got-it, flaunt-it syndrome. 
However, the real pro will tell you to choose your joint to suit the job. And 
in many cases, the direct approach is not only faster and easier, but just as 
strong as the fancier solution. 
</P>
<P>
 The simplest way to join two pieces of wood is to cut them to size, apply glue 
to the mating surfaces and put the assembly in clamps until the glue sets. 
Unfortunately, this method doesn't work well if there's any end grain involved. 
End-grain joints require reinforcing, usually with dowels or splines, so the 
glue joins the pieces through adequate long-grain contact. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, dowels and splines are also handy for aligning and 
reinforcing ordinary edge-to-edge joints. When combined with milled joints such 
as tongue-and-groove joints and glue joints, you'll be prepared to solve a wide 
range of joinery problems. Best of all, you can make most of these joints 
quickly and accurately, using ordinary hand and power tools. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, we'll look at techniques for basic butt joints and doweled joints: Basic 
Butt Joints 
</P>
<P>
 When used correctly, today's glues are stronger than the wood itself. 
Therefore, when laminating stock to produce wide panels, there's a good 
argument for leaving out any type of reinforcing. 
</P>
<P>
 The secret to a successful edge-to-edge glue joint is perfect contact along 
the entire mating surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Begin by laying out the boards and marking them as they are to be assembled. 
If you have a jointer, joint each edge. Check for fit by placing the mating 
surfaces together and looking for any light that passes through the seam. 
</P>
<P>
 To fine-tune a joint, or do the job entirely by hand, fold two adjacent boards 
together and hold them in your vise so both mating surfaces can be planed at 
once. Then, true the edges with the longest plane you have. Because both edges 
are planed together, slightly out of square planing is negated when the boards 
are unfolded and joined. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep the boards aligned when gluing them together, sandwich straight boards 
on both ends of the assembly and clamp. Then, apply clamps across the assembly. 
Alternate these clamps above and below the panel to equalize the pressure and 
reduce any tendency the assembly has to cup. Doweled Joints 
</P>
<P>
 Using dowels in a butt joint increases the mechanical resistance to lateral 
stresses and maintains alignment when gluing the boards together. 
</P>
<P>
 While it's a popular alternative to simple butt joints, keep in mind that it 
often creates a cross-grain assembly. In edge joints, avoid using dowels longer 
than about 1 1/2 inches. Otherwise, the dowels may actually force the joint 
open if the wood dries and shrinks. Always make the dowel holes slightly deeper 
than necessary and either buy or make grooved dowel pins so excess glue can 
escape. 
</P>
<P>
 To add dowels to an edge-to-edge joint, first place adjacent boards together 
and use a square to mark center lines on both edges. Use a doweling jig to 
ensure that the holes will be square to the edges and at a uniform distance 
from the work faces. 
</P>
<P>
 Some doweling jigs are self-centering. If using the non-centering type, be 
sure to reference one side of the jig with a designated work face on the stock 
to ensure that adjacent faces will be aligned. 
</P>
<P>
 Use a depth stop or piece of tape wrapped around the drill bit to gauge hole 
depth.

DECORATING; ENJOY LIVING OUT OF A SUITCASE -- AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MAYER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Different times, different needs. Old suitcases and steamer trunks are 
enjoying new life as home accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 These vintage pieces "evoke the romance of the old-fashioned travel 
experience. They also serve a useful purpose as extra storage and tabletops," 
Carol Schalla says. "What's even more fun about old suitcases is that you can 
usually find a style that works with your specific decor." 
</P>
<P>
 Schalla, editor of Victorian Sampler in St. Charles, Ill., recently began 
featuring suitcases, steamer trunks and hatboxes in the magazine to illustrate 
their appeal as unconventional storage units and tables. 
</P>
<P>
 In one photo, eight vintage cases are stacked in graduated sizes and used for 
long-term storage. Another layout pairs leather and wicker as a coffee table 
for a wicker sofa. Then there's the open steamer trunk standing in the guest 
room. With hangers on one side and drawers on the other, these trunks make 
handy armoires. 
</P>
<P>
 There's an art to choosing the right luggage for a particular decor. For a 
masculine room or one with a Victorian theme, Schalla might use leather or 
fiberboard cases in a herringbone pattern and metal corner caps. For country 
styles, plaid and wicker cases set the tone. 
</P>
<P>
 Beat-up is not all bad with old suitcases. Scrapes and scratches and travel 
stickers often add character. Because suitcases come in many sizes, there's one 
to fit almost any storage need. A small, shallow case works as a lap desk. The 
top is used as a writing surface, the inside as storage for papers and writing 
instruments. One of those squarish train cases with a mirror inside the lid can 
turn any table into a dressing table. 
</P>
<P>
 Drum-size hatboxes, once for stylish chapeaus and later used as overnight 
bags, can be stacked as a table. Less sturdy, but quite useful as pretty 
storage containers are cardboard hatboxes covered with flowered or striped 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardboard hatboxes are available in closet shops and department and gift 
stores. Sometimes they're free with the purchase of a hat. Antique hatboxes are 
few because they were so fragile. 
</P>
<P>
 It's best to look for old luggage in attics -- yours or those of friends and 
relatives -- because the pickings are slim at public places. 
</P>
<P>
 "You used to find suitcases for $5 at every church rummage sale," says 
antiques commentator Terry Kovel of Shaker Heights, Ohio. "I am sure you 
couldn't find one for $50 today." 
</P>
<P>
 Top brands in suitcases and trunks have always been pricey, says the author of 
"Kovel Antiques and Collectibles Price List" (Crown, $14). In the 1995 edition 
due out this winter, prices for old trunks range from $100 for an Oshkosh 
wardrobe trunk from the 1930s to $2,500 for a Louis Vuitton fitted steamer 
trunk from 1910. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeal of old travel cases is hardly new. The craze for 19th-Century, 
dome-topped trunks started decades ago, Kovel says. When they became scarce, 
people switched to flat-topped trunks. Now, suitcases and steamers from the 
early and middle decades of the 20th Century are popular. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're not up to pawing through flea markets and attics, not to worry. 
Manufacturers of new furniture are onto the look. 
</P>
<P>
 Elden Collections, an Orange County furniture design and manufacturing firm, 
sells a set of five drawers that look like old-fashioned luggage. Each chest 
has luggage-like details, such as metal corner caps and strap pulls. Stacked in 
graduated sizes, in red, brown, green, tan or blue, they look like a stack of 
suitcases. The tower of drawers retails for about $2,395. 
</P>
<P>
 Elden, which distributes its furniture lines throughout the country, has its 
sales and manufacturing facility in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 "This group started as 'let's do trunks' a little over a year and a half ago," 
says Alan Needle, owner of Elden Collections. "People are using trunks as 
coffee tables and lamp tables, and that is why we paid particular attention to 
the corner details." 
</P>

TOOLS; EXERCISE CAUTION WHEN HANDLING CHAIN SAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A chain saw can make short work of cutting heavy brush, tree limbs and trees. 
But it's potentially dangerous and should be handled with extreme care. Here 
are some safety tips: 
</P>
<P>
 * Plan your work well. Don't use your saw in semi-darkness or when fatigue, 
intoxication or illness may impair your coordination. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wear heavy gloves, steel-toed work shoes, safety goggles and a hard hat. 
Don't wear clothing that is too light or too loose. Use ear plugs if you plan 
to work with a saw for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 * While cutting, hold the saw firmly with both hands and stand with your feet 
solidly placed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep others away from your cutting area. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure the saw is free of obstructions. Kickbacks from hitting 
surrounding tree limbs, earth, rocks and other obstacles cause many injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 * Turn off the ignition switch (or unplug an electric model) before refueling, 
touching the chain, or performing any other maintenance or repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 * After refueling, move at least 10 feet from the spot before starting the 
saw; spilled gasoline can easily ignite. Keep a fire extinguisher handy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Start your saw on the ground. Then start the chain before making contact 
with the wood to prevent saw kickback. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stand to the side of the saw when cutting, never directly behind it. Oil-Gas 
Mix 
</P>
<P>
 Most chain saws are powered by a two-cycle engine that uses a gasoline-oil mix 
to provide lubrication. It's entirely different than the oil used in 
automobiles or to lubricate the saw's chain, and it's sold prepackaged to mix 
with one or two gallons of gasoline. Always mix the oil and gasoline in a 
separate, clean container. Pour the oil in first, then add some gasoline and 
slosh it around until thoroughly mixed. Add the rest of the gas and pour the 
mixture into the saw's fuel tank. 
</P>
<P>
 All saws have either automatic or manual oilers that lubricate the chain. Both 
types must be refilled frequently with the grade of oil specified by the 
manufacturer. With the manual oiler, push the oiling button about once every 
minute while cutting. Check the oil level during use to avoid overheating and 
damaging the chain. Refueling 
</P>
<P>
 Brush away any sawdust around the gas cap. Keep the fuel clean by also 
brushing dirt from the container. Always wipe spilled fuel from the engine 
housing to avoid a fire hazard and possible fouling of the starter, the engine 
or the carburetor. Cleaning 
</P>
<P>
 Keep your chain saw free of accumulated sawdust. Use a wire or small 
screwdriver to clean the oil holes in the guide bar and the guide-bar slot. 
Brush all vents around the engine housing and the muffler to permit efficient 
cooling. 
</P>
<P>
 Check the spark plug before heavy use. If it is heavily coated with oil 
deposits, replace it. 
</P>
<P>
 After every five to 10 hours of cutting, clean the cylinder fins with a stiff 
brush and a vacuum extension tool. Remove the sheet metal covers and the 
muffler to reach the fins. Remove the air filter, wash it in detergent and 
water, rinse, and dry thoroughly before reinstalling it. Chain Tension 
</P>
<P>
 Proper chain tension is the key to safe and efficient cutting. Read your 
owner's manual for chain-tension adjustment guidelines. The tension changes due 
to heating during operation, stretching and wear. Check the chain tension 
frequently during cutting, especially the first half-hour. Let the saw cool 
before changing the tension. 
</P>
<P>
 If your gas-powered saw stalls often or if the chain moves rapidly along the 
bar as the engine idles, adjust the idle speed, following your owner's manual 
instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharpen the chain after every four hours of use. Get a set of special files 
and gauges and follow the directions in your owner's manual.

ACCENTS; PRISMS OF CHANDELIER ADD SPARKLE TO WOOD, STEEL TRIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MAYER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the strongest decorating trends these days is to create an eclectic 
setting, a mix of two or more styles such as traditional and modern. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the idea behind new lighting and accessories that mix the chandelier's 
glass prism with steel and wood. They represent a blending of another sort, as 
well: designer Andree Putman, a doyenne of modernism, and Baccarat, maker of 
"crystal for kings." 
</P>
<P>
 Putman, the French force behind the interiors of the Air France Concorde and 
two trendy New York hotels, the Morgan and Paramount, would seem an odd choice 
for Baccarat, which started as a window and mirror company in 1764 with the 
blessing of Louis XV. It began working exclusively in crystal in 1817 for 
commoners and royalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company's association with Andree Putman is part of an initiative to 
reinvigorate the brand and its image," said Baccarat's chairman, Anne-Claire 
Taittinger-Bonnemaison. 
</P>
<P>
 The element common to all the pieces is the use of crystal prisms that catch 
the light as they sway in any chance breeze. The French word for a dangling 
decoration is "pampille," and the designs are known as the Pampilles 
Collection. Prices range from $250 to $5,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Gail Green, a New York interior designer, put a candelabrum, mirror and 
picture frame in a library at the Southampton Showcase House on Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea of prisms is fabulous because they cast rainbows all around the room 
. . . depending on when and where the light comes through the windows," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Known today for its crystal stemware, tumblers and decanters, Baccarat was 
once equally famous for chandeliers, which the company began making in 1840. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Putman created the Pampilles Collection, she prowled Baccarat's Paris 
warehouse and its manufacturing plant in the Lorraine region of France. She 
decided that each item should include one or more prisms, used like tassels. 
The designer enjoys the contrast of opulent crystal accents with unornamented 
shapes in steel and wood. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a lot of arrogance in design lately," Putman said. "These 
designs are the opposite of spectacular."

MUSEUMS; LARGE ESTATES ARE LITTLE GEMS AS WINDOWS ON A LOST WAY OF LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MAYER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a brief period early in the century, country estates for wealthy Americans 
multiplied quickly. But by the 1950s, they were white elephants. 
</P>
<P>
 Servants were scarce and upkeep was costly, so much of the land was broken 
into smaller parcels for development, and the houses were torn down or greatly 
altered. 
</P>
<P>
 More from luck than planning, some survived as museums, offering examples of 
craftsmanship and decoration and a window on a way of life reserved for the 
wealthy. One such is Reynolda House, built with tobacco money in Winston-Salem, 
N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 The 64-room white stucco mansion, outbuildings and gardens on 1,067 acres were 
built between 1912 and 1917 for R.J. and Katharine S. Reynolds. The house, on 
about 30 acres, has been a museum since 1965. About 10 years before, Wake 
Forest University was deeded 350 acres of the estate and moved its campus from 
the hamlet of Wake Forest not far from Durham. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was new, Reynolda was literally a world of its own. There were a model 
farm and dairy, extensive ornamental gardens, polo grounds, a man-made lake and 
a church, school and post office in a village where employes lived. Reynolda 
House was remodeled in the 1930s and remained a family home through the early 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "What saved Reynolda is that the family that owned it had the money to keep it 
and then turned it into an art museum," says Nicholas Bragg, museum director. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection at the Reynolda House Museum of American Art was donated by 
various Reynolds foundations as well as outsiders. It includes 135 pieces from 
1755 to the present and is displayed in rooms that retain their original 
character and, in some cases, furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors -- there are about 75,000 annually -- can tour at their own pace, 
concentrating on art or furnishings as they prefer. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolda House, less ostentatious on the outside than many country houses of 
the era, was designed by Philadelphia architect Charles Barton Keen. 
</P>
<P>
 He was well-known as a designer of grand yet comfortable structures 
incorporating elements of traditional American farm buildings. The house seems 
to nestle in the setting as it is glimpsed from a long driveway that winds 
through acres of manicured lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 The interior is grand. In the reception hall, living room and dining room, 
there are fluted pilasters with Corinthian, Ionic or Doric capitals, as well as 
paneling, carved moldings, rosettes and plaques in plaster or wood. Most major 
rooms have marble fireplaces, and the walls of the two-story reception hall are 
faced with limestone. 
</P>
<P>
 The house is outfitted with three kitchens, two dumbwaiters, 14 bathrooms and 
a pipe organ. An indoor recreation area includes a swimming pool, bowling 
alley, Art Deco-style bar, squash court, shooting gallery and table tennis and 
billiards rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The architect ordered the costliest method of painting for the main rooms: 
so-called French polishing in which at least seven coats of paint were put 
down, each sanded before the next, and the final coat rubbed by hand to an 
eggshell gloss. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the best-known carriage trade companies supplied furnishings: lighting 
fixtures and fireplace accessories from E.F. Caldwell & Co. of New York, cast 
iron balcony railing from Samuel Yellin of Philadelphia, cabinetry and probably 
woodwork from Irving & Casson-A.H. Davenport of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Millhouse, the museum's president, is a granddaughter of the original 
owners and spent time in the mansion as a child. She and Bragg, the director, 
are working to refurbish one bedroom to its original decor. 
</P>
<P>
 In the absence of written plans or photographs, they look for clues in 
unlikely places. One was hidden in the canopy bed. Beneath an outer covering of 
muslin was a fragment of embroidered silk. Millhouse wants to have the fabric 
copied. The delicate question is whether to match the canopy and window 
curtains. 
</P>
<P>
 "One expert told us these always matched," she says, "and another said that 
they never did in this period." 
</P>
<P>
 The Reynolda House museum is open Tuesday through Sunday year-round, offering 
seminars on historic houses and American art, literature and music. Each summer 
it is host to American Foundations, a six-week, college-level program in which 
students examine a work of art in depth and, to a lesser extent, the music and 
literature of the period. For further information: Reynolda House Museum of 
American Art, P.O. Box 11765, Winston-Salem, NC 27116. (910) 725-5325.

O.C. LAB'S DRUG STINGS YIELDED FEW JAIL TERMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON and LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most of the drug users arrested by Santa Ana police officers dealing 
county-made crack cocaine are not sent to jail even though the controversial 
stings are intended to make small-time buyers eligible for harsher punishments, 
authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Carl Armbrust acknowledged that a majority of the 350 
people arrested during the past 18 months were first-time buyers and were 
assigned to drug diversion programs instead of receiving jail or prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor also said that authorities involved in the so-called reverse 
sting operations are actually trying to build felony rap sheets against users 
who will eventually be eligible for prison sentences if they are arrested a 
second time. 
</P>
<P>
 "My personal feeling is that these drug treatment programs don't do a lot of 
good," said Armbrust, the prosecutor in charge of the Narcotics Enforcement 
Team. "If they don't get cured, chances are we are going to get them again and 
then they go to jail." 
</P>
<P>
 But Orange County Public Defender Ronald Y. Butler questioned whether the 
police actions amount to entrapment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since most of these people are first-time offenders, you have to wonder if 
they would be purchasing drugs at all if the police weren't out there enticing 
them," Butler said. "I would seriously question the efficacy of their efforts. 
I think the motives are pure, but the means to the end seem to be really 
stretching it."  
</P>
<P>
 Butler confirmed that many defendants are being referred to drug diversion 
programs instead of prison or jail -- an apparent shortcoming of the police 
tactics. Diversion allows people to avoid jail time if they successfully 
complete drug treatment programs that last six to eight weeks. Police counter 
that about one-third of those arrested were on parole or probation for another 
offense when they bought drugs from undercover officers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Armbrust and Santa Ana police officials defend the operations in which the 
Orange County Crime Laboratory has been manufacturing $10 and $20 pieces of 
rock cocaine for undercover officers to sell on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't measure the success of this program just by how many people end up 
in jail," said Santa Ana Police Lt. Robert Helton. "We also rely on people in 
the neighborhoods to tell us whether things are getting better. I think we are 
seeing a significant degree of success here." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler said his staff will file a legal brief as early as Monday, contending 
that the manufacture of the highly addictive rock or crack cocaine amounts to 
"outrageous government conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 The public defender's brief is being patterned after a similar legal objection 
filed in Broward County, Fla., where a state appeals court ruled that the 
county sheriff acted illegally in manufacturing rock cocaine for undercover 
drug investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Florida ruling resulted in the reversal of hundreds of convictions 
obtained from reverse sting investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 Reverse sting operations using real rock cocaine have been deemed legal by 
California courts. Deputy Public Defender Kevin Phillips contends that the 
county lab's role in cooking the rock makes it offensive enough to classify it 
as "outrageous conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't found any authority in statutes and case law that permits them to 
do it," Phillips said. "As a matter of fact, the only thing I found was 
something that says it's illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini issued a statement for the first time 
Friday about the county crime lab's role in the Santa Ana investigations and 
said the lab's staff converted about "one cup" of powder cocaine to rocks for 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 Martini said Santa Ana police provided the drugs from the department's store 
of drug seizures involving cases that had already ended. Release of the drugs 
was approved by court order signed by Orange County Superior Court Judge 
Michael Brenner. 
</P>
<P>
 Armbrust said the unconventional tactics are well worth the effort. Arresting 
addicts or users in possession of real drugs makes them eligible for felony 
rather than misdemeanor prosecutions. Instead of adding to a string of 
non-prison misdemeanors, the prosecutor said, they are able to wield "the 
hammer" of likely prison time on the second offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy with what we are doing," Armbrust said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's guidelines for the reverse stings state that officers 
are not supposed to solicit business and should sell only to people who ask for 
drugs, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
 The police stings generally have drawn approval this week from city and county 
officials who have described the Santa Ana operation as an example of 
aggressive police work. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Councilman Miguel A. Pulido Jr. said Friday that he has heard only 
words of support from residents since details of the operation were disclosed. 
Police arrested most of the 350 defendants in the "Weed and Seed" area, a 
high-crime neighborhood where federal dollars have been spent to "weed" out 
crime. Other sales were made in the neighborhood near Willard Intermediate 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, Pulido said some of the federal money helped to pay for the 
controversial reverse sting operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing concerns for the potential liabilities involved in manufacturing and 
dealing rock cocaine, many police agencies say they are hesitant to employ such 
methods. But others, now aware of the Santa Ana experience, are supportive of 
the technique. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Capt. Bob Hansohn, who oversees street-level narcotics 
investigations, said the department never seriously considered small-time 
reverse sting operations. But he said Friday he is preparing a proposal for 
consideration by Chief Willie L. Williams that could put some of his officers 
on the street dealing much like the Santa Ana police.  
</P>
<P>
 If needed, Hansohn said, Los Angeles police officers could be supplied with 
rock cocaine manufactured by the Los Angeles County crime lab. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the conventional methods aren't working, I believe we have the obligation 
to look at knocking out the problem in other ways," Hansohn said. "This 
proposal is just in the preliminary stages. (Chief Williams) may or may not 
agree." 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena police have been selling street drugs, rather than those cooked by 
police, during reverse stings for about eight years, Lt. Jerry Schultze said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the court order approving Santa Ana's program, the Orange County district 
attorney's office cited two Pasadena cases in which state courts ruled that 
reverse stings were legal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Inglewood Police Department also has been selling rock cocaine undercover 
since 1988, when it combined its program with a billboard campaign that warned: 
"Behind that Rock Could be a Cop," Capt. Jim Seymour said. 
</P>
<P>
 The police operations and billboard campaign helped earn the city All American 
City distinction in 1989. And two years later, Gov. Pete Wilson appointed 
then-Police Chief Ray Johnson as director of the California Office of Criminal 
Justice Planning, lauding him for the reverse sting program. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Santa Ana program, Johnson said, the city has not lost any of the 
rock nuggets by having suspects swallow them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some pop it in their mouths, but . . . we just gently massage the neck until 
they gag," Seymour said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the Orange County Crime Lab is cooking the rock cocaine should 
not make a difference, Seymour said. His department has always used rock 
cocaine confiscated in busts of sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose is not for cops to emulate bad guys," he said. "I think Santa Ana 
is on the right track. If rocking it up is causing the problem for Santa Ana, 
they can come up and we'll give them whatever they need."

COLUMN ONE; 'SMILE, YOU'RE IN AMERICA'; KOREAN AMERICANS, DEVASTATED BY THE 
RIOTS, TAKE LESSONS ON SENSITIVITY AND ACCULTURATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With the zeal of an evangelist and humor of a comic, Byung Sik Hong travels 
around Los Angeles and Orange counties urging Korean immigrants to put on a 
happy face and smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "Practice smiling every chance you get," advises Hong, a Korean American 
management expert and volunteer cultural sensitivity trainer. "Even if you 
speak broken English, you can still convey friendliness with a smile, a firm 
handshake or a pat on the back." 
</P>
<P>
 He tells immigrants who come from a culture where bowing, not handshaking is 
the rule, to shake hands often, and to "squeeze" the hand while looking people 
directly in the eye. Koreans have a tendency to drop their hand like a "dead 
fish," he says. "Who wants to touch a dead fish?" 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1992 riots -- the most traumatic event in the collective experience 
of 1 million Koreans in the United States -- a lot of effort has gone into 
helping immigrants avoid the behavior that is often misinterpreted by those 
unfamiliar with their culture. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, many factors contributed to the targeting of Korean American-owned 
businesses during the riots. Korean community leaders readily acknowledge that 
unpleasant encounters had occurred between Korean shopkeepers and their 
customers. But, they believe, the negative media portrayal of Korean 
shopkeepers as rude and uncaring people -- without adequate response from 
Korean proprietors -- was the main reason why Koreans were singled out in the 
looting and firebombing during the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Though they feel strongly that this media-reinforced stereotype was unfair, 
their frustration has propelled thoughtful Korean Americans to come together to 
try to climb over the cultural wall that has made Koreans perhaps the most 
misunderstood of Asian immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get to know Koreans, you'll find them compassionate, kind and 
loyal," said Hong. But Koreans neither toot their horn nor go out of their way 
to make it easy for outsiders to get to know them, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 In churches, social and professional gatherings and in the Korean-language 
news media, there has been considerable talk about the nexus between 
acculturation and the future of Koreans in Los Angeles, the city with the 
biggest Korean population outside Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Two and a half years after the riots, "Smile, you're in America" has become a 
new mantra for Koreans, having replaced the one of "Work, work, work." 
</P>
<P>
 "The riots taught us it is not enough to work hard," said economist Ky Chuoen 
Kim, president of the nonprofit Korean American Management Assn., which offers 
classes to help immigrant entrepreneurs acculturate and acquire business savvy. 
"You need to work hard but you also have to be culturally sensitive and know 
American business practices." 
</P>
<P>
 From the Koreatown studios of Radio Korea and FM-Seoul, Kim and Hong offer 
daily lessons on how to succeed in America by changing. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent broadcast, Hong counseled Korean American shopkeepers to greet 
their customers as they would visiting relatives from South Korea. If they wait 
for customers to pay for their purchases, and plunk down the change on the 
counter without being attentive, they are sure to engender bad feelings, Hong 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They feel insulted when someone just puts the change on the counter," said 
Hong, 61, who has worked 30 years for major U.S. companies, including Hughes 
Aircraft. A devout Mormon who lives in Mission Viejo, Hong sees his present 
work as God's calling. 
</P>
<P>
 Public service announcements on local Korean television and radio stations 
also remind immigrants that they live in multicultural America, not 
monocultural Korea, and that they should learn English. 
</P>
<P>
 "In multiethnic L.A., we need to adjust our thinking and behavior," said one 
radio spot, imploring Korean Americans to try to be friendly when interacting 
with people of other races. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows just how effective the campaign has been. But indications that 
the drive is having results are visible even in such unlikely places as MTA 
buses. 
</P>
<P>
 On a midsummer afternoon, three elderly Korean women stepped on the No. 28 bus 
headed Downtown from Koreatown. As they showed their monthly senior passes, the 
women smiled and thanked the driver. Their thank yous came out "tank q" and 
their smiles appeared a bit awkward, but the goodwill apparent in the gestures 
registered with the black driver, who reciprocated with a smile of his own, and 
"You're welcome." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Smiling, saying "hello" and shaking hands may be natural to most Americans, 
but they are not for Korean immigrants in whose culture a smile and small talk 
are usually reserved for friends and families -- and from their point of view, 
not to be squandered on strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first generation, especially those arriving here after age 30, it is 
tough to change their ways, said the Rev. Hee-Min Park, senior pastor of 
Youngnak Presbyterian Church of Los Angeles, who often injects the value of 
acculturation in his sermons to 5,000 worshipers each Sunday. "Koreans -- 
especially the men -- were brought up not to be expressive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though displaying emotions may not be a virtue in his culture, businessman 
Jimmy Park has taken to heart the old adage about doing what Romans do when 
you're in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 Park, proprietor of a South-Central liquor store, has long tried to blend in 
-- at times even talking like some of his customers, four-letter words and all. 
He smiles and talks to anybody who walks into his shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi, buddy, what's you doin'?" he greets regulars with a big smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Park says Koreans definitely should smile more and lower their voices. 
"Koreans have loud voices," he said. That, combined with dour faces and limited 
English, can lead to miscommunication. 
</P>
<P>
 His customers like Park's business style, but he is glad his wife does not 
work at the store and see him smile so much. 
</P>
<P>
 "An (inappropriate) smile, in the parlance of Korean culture, equals 
shallowness and thoughtlessness," said Korean American commentator K.W. Lee, 
who has lived in the United States for nearly half a century. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why, Lee noted, it is so rare to see photos of smiling cabinet 
members, church ministers or community leaders in Korean language newspapers or 
on TV because people in those positions are expected to project a serious and 
dignified image. 
</P>
<P>
 The impassive traits of Korean American shopkeepers doing business here can 
send a wrong message -- and even be misconstrued as racism. 
</P>
<P>
 Behavioral scientist Thomas J. Knutson depicted a typical scenario to 
illustrate how that can happen in transactions with black customers: 
</P>
<P>
 "When an African American enters a store, that person is expecting some sort 
of eye contact and pleasantry. When a Korean American shopkeeper, reluctant to 
develop friendship with a stranger, doesn't provide that, an African American 
may think the store owner is being disrespectful or rude." 
</P>
<P>
 By the same token, he said, a Korean American might see the more outgoing 
style of the African American as inappropriate and, sometimes, threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 To Korean immigrants, indoctrinated in a highly structured Confucian culture 
in which formality is stressed, some of the informal behavior of American 
youths offends their sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Koreans very much mind manners," said Korean American philosopher Chin-Tae 
Kim, of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. "They regard other groups 
as totally lacking in manners." 
</P>
<P>
 But sensibilities, like aesthetics, are in the eye of the beholder. 
</P>
<P>
 All too often African American criticisms of Korean merchants are identical to 
those Koreans have about black customers, said Larry Aubry, a human relations 
specialist who has spent years trying to bring together black and Korean 
American communities in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost as if you take the same thing (that they are arrogant, rude, 
aggressive and disrespectful) and ask Koreans and they say the same thing about 
African Americans -- except they would add that young ones tend to steal," 
Aubry said. 
</P>
<P>
 He does not want to minimize the value of Koreans striving to become more 
culturally sensitive, he says, but adds that they are naive if they think that 
will solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a basis for all of the hostility . . . that just pours out of the 
African American community," he said, referring to the racism blacks 
historically have faced in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing short of a national "political will" to eliminate institutionalized 
racism against blacks can solve that, Aubry said, and Korean immigrants should 
know that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A motorist driving through Koreatown may not notice it, but walk inside the 
area's many mini-malls and shopping centers and one can see how much has 
changed since the riots. Koreatown entrepreneurs have been putting up scores of 
English store signs where previously only Korean signs were displayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Entrepreneurs are also flocking to English and Spanish language classes to 
better relate to their non-Korean customers. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, more than 500 business people have taken sensitivity training to 
learn U.S.-style communication skills being offered by the Korean American 
Management Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Every Thursday evening about 120 people show up for a three-hour seminar 
designed to help them not only understand American ways but to develop their 
mom-and-pop operations into mainstream businesses. The 18-week session, at the 
Radisson Wilshire Plaza Hotel in Koreatown, provides courses in U.S. law, 
government, histories of blacks and Latinos, and business practices. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is in such demand it keeps Ky Chuoen Kim hopping to bring in 
lecturers -- almost all of them U.S.-educated Korean American professors, 
lawyers and business experts. Some come from as far away as Texas and New York, 
donating their time and expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 Ho K. Gum, who completed the program in August, says it has helped him better 
manage his Mission Hills store. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the training, I'm mindful not only about my relationship with customers 
but my employees' relationship and the customers too," Gum said. "I'm always 
reminding my employees to smile and to go out of their way to be cordial." 
</P>
<P>
 And because of the class, he now has a filing system at his business. "When a 
bill collector bills me twice, I can pull out the evidence right out of my 
files," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Maintaining a filing system may be a normal business practice for some, but it 
never occurred to him, said Gum, who was a civil engineer in Seoul. "I was 
running my business like a small corner shop in Korea." 
</P>
<P>
 During one recent class, lecturer Yong Hwan Ryu, a specialist on international 
business, drew a picture of a potted pine tree to illustrate a lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Korean American community is just like this tree," he said. "Unless we 
get out of the pot and grow our roots deep into the soil, we will never become 
part of America." 
</P>
<P>
 Lessons in acculturation include basic constitutional concepts, such as the 
presumption of innocence until proven guilty, and that all people are created 
equal -- which Americans usually take for granted but are foreign to Korean 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 To the first generation steeped in Confucianism, all people definitely are not 
equal: Men are superior to women. The young must respect the old. Education, 
pedigree, age, social and professional positions and titles all count. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of the accused being presumed innocent until proven guilty is hard 
for Korean immigrants to accept, especially when one has witnessed a crime. In 
Korea, a person caught shoplifting can be roughed up by anyone. But here, that 
could result in charges of battery and assault. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of extending respect to children, especially those who misbehave, is 
almost impossible for traditional Koreans. Koreans pamper their children but 
youngsters are expected to obey their elders. 
</P>
<P>
 Tae-Suk Kim, who operates a market in a racially mixed San Fernando Valley 
neighborhood, says he has had to train himself to conform to the American way. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how young they are, in America, you have to treat them civilly," 
Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have kids who buy batteries from my store, use them all day in their 
boomboxes and come back on the following day, complaining that the batteries 
were defective," Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
 If that happened in South Korea, a store owner could give the youngsters a 
good scolding and send them away. But Kim has learned to hold his tongue and 
write it off as another cost of doing business in a society where, he said, it 
seems that only wrongdoers have any rights. 
</P>
<P>
 America is not the place most Koreans had thought it would be. 
</P>
<P>
 "Korean immigrants come here knowing very little about the country," said 
Edward Chang, a UC Riverside ethnic studies professor who teaches black and 
Latino histories in the sensitivity seminar. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang agrees with Aubry that poverty and alienation will require a national 
political will to resolve, but in the meantime, he says, Koreans need to 
continue their learning process and get out of their insulated world. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Korean community is very internal," said Ramona Cortes Garza, director of 
community relations at UCLA, who has worked with Korean American groups. 
</P>
<P>
 She noted that many Latinos perceive Koreans as "aggressive," and "very 
driven" -- something Koreans find puzzling because they consider hard work to 
be one of their cherished traits. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a cultural thing," said political scientist Fernando Guerra, 
chairman of Chicano studies at Loyola Marymount University. "Mexicans and 
(other) Latin Americans have prided themselves in not only working hard but 
also knowing when to relax. We're saying (to Koreans), 'Hey, relax.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Accusations that Korean shopkeepers charge too much are unfair, Guerra says, 
because it is the nature of small businesses, not the ethnicity of owners, to 
charge more. But it is easy to attribute that to ethnic differences instead of 
economic reality, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't realize how difficult it is to work in South-Central," said Gum, 
whose first store was located there. "My life was on the line every day." 
</P>
<P>
 For ethnic Koreans in the United States -- 85% of whom are immigrants -- the 
trans-cultural journey has been an unending travail because of the cultural 
baggage they carry. 
</P>
<P>
 In that context, as devastating as the riots were, they did help push the 
Korean American community further toward Americanization. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took the riots to free Koreans from their cultural Teflon," said 
commentator Lee. Until the riots' assault on their lifestyle, he said, American 
ways simply did not "stick." 
</P>
<P>
 With their world shattered, Korean immigrants have embarked on a new journey 
to cross over some of the old cultural barriers that have eluded so many of 
them in the past.

NEWS ANALYSIS; WILSON, BROWN STYLES BELIE WHO'S LEADING IN THE POLLS; POLITICS: 
IN LAST STAGES OF THE CAMPAIGN, HE SEEMS A CONCERNED CHALLENGER, SHE A 
FREEWHEELING FRONT-RUNNER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kathleen Brown had just finished the latest broadside against her opponent for 
governor when the voice of a television reporter came wafting toward her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Governor Brown," the reporter said, mistakenly substituting her name for Pete 
Wilson's. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gov. Brown! Yes! Yes! Yes!" exulted the Democratic candidate, thrusting her 
arm dramatically skyward with each exclamation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been called a lot of things in this campaign," Brown said, then indulged 
in a comedian's pause. "And I like that one." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last and longest stage of the campaign, where nerves are frayed to 
shreds, sleep usually comes only fleetingly and the pressure of always being on 
can seem unbearable, Kathleen Brown is loose. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere along the path to Election Day, she cast off the shroud of public 
caution that she has draped around herself most of her life. With less than 
three weeks to go before judgment, she is belting out her message with a verve 
unseen even a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 If polls are to be believed -- and the consultants and managers on both sides 
do believe them -- Republican Wilson is substantially ahead in his race for a 
second term. And the Democratic state treasurer, as the numbers have it, has 
watched a double-digit lead hurtle earthward, leaving her struggling for money 
and attention. 
</P>
<P>
 But never, if you saw Wilson and Brown out in public as their hard-fought 
campaign wrenches toward conclusion, would their actions betray the political 
realities. Wilson comes across not so much a confident front-runner as a 
concerned challenger. Brown comes across not so much a desperate challenger as 
a freewheeling front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign style frequently, of course, bears little similarity to the outcome. 
This year, in this race, it may be less a reflection of their comparative 
standing than a window on their public personas. If Wilson is behaving as 
though he is taking nothing for granted, Brown is acting like she has nothing 
to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Out on the stump, the tradition of public handshaking and speechmaking seems 
almost quaint now, like fist-to-fist combat conducted under a sky filled with 
media smart bombs. It might look impressive but have little impact, so it is 
easy to dismiss. 
</P>
<P>
 But campaigning is an art form, and on this day Brown is an artist. In the 
computer-filled graphic design classrooms at Pasadena High School, she is 
gliding through with her entourage of four, all scattered by teen-agers who are 
looking at her curiously. What she seems to be, to them, is a hip mom, quietly 
supportive of a student whose computer literacy abandons him under pressure, 
able to converse brightly about the advantages of a software program whose 
headquarters she has previously toured. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary, it's so good," says Brown, whose own computer guru comes in the 
form of her son Zeb, who is not much older than these students. She turns to 
one with a grin that seems suddenly wicked. "You can really do some things that 
could be dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Hers is not a campaign that has seemed dangerous; for most of its tenure the 
Brown effort has labored under the perhaps unfair expectation that she was a 
gold-plated candidate capable of beating the stuffing out of a man who is 
perennially California's most underrated pol. As the gap widened between that 
potential and reality, both the effort and Brown have seemed occasionally 
erratic. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, as with all campaigns behind in the final weeks, the rumors circle 
like buzzards. She's broke. (Campaign aides say there is enough money to be 
competitive, if not enough to match Wilson.) The campaign is in disarray. 
(Campaign aides say events are being changed hurriedly sometimes, but only to 
take advantage of political developments). 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has been considered down for the count long enough that it comes as 
something of a surprise when she walks into a Pasadena classroom and delivers a 
punchy, crisp speech that matches assaults on Wilson with glimpses of her own 
vision of California. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing, though, that could prepare the gathered students for Brown's 
sudden left turn from the subject of welfare reform to the topic of teen-age 
pregnancy. Specifically, Brown's own. She asks how many of the 50 or so 
students have a friend who is a teen-age parent. Every one of them raises a 
hand, and Brown looks stricken. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me tell you, I was almost a teen-age parent," she says quietly. "I got 
married when I was 19 years old. I had my first child four days after my 20th 
birthday. I had every advantage to have in life. I had a great family, I was 
married, I had finished high school. I had a year and a half, two years of 
college under my belt. 
</P>
<P>
 "And my life changed. My life changed. And I think about teen-agers who don't 
have those advantages. We have to help our kids understand that they have the 
power and the skills to change their lives. To take control of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time she finishes, with a plea to the students for help, not a sound 
can be heard. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If Brown is buoyant and verges on the effervescent in her public dealings, 
Wilson carries with him the almost visible weight of office. Wrinkles of worry 
crease his forehead. The relative conviviality that marked his 1990 campaign, 
when he was running as the "compassionate conservative," has faded, replaced 
with a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is not too far out of the old focus, and that stability is the secret 
of Wilson's success. His self-deprecating, wry humor is still present. He never 
gets too excited when things are going well, never too aggravated when they are 
going poorly. Always, he is the personification of the even keel. 
</P>
<P>
 This day, Wilson blends in perfectly with the blue-clad sea of business owners 
gathered in the warehouse of a Hollywood plant. He is distinguishable from 
those who have gathered in his support only by the gentlemen around him with 
conspicuous earpieces and wrist walkie-talkies. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first of three back-to-back, business-oriented events, and Wilson is 
demonstrating why, even if the conversation seems acutely arcane to outsiders, 
he is the business owners' candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Stilted economic argot drips off his tongue. He boasts of reinstituting the 
"small business net operating loss carry-forward," which is accounting talk for 
writing off losses in future years when a business is profitable. Better that, 
he says, than Brown's tax moratorium plan that would take effect in early years 
when many businesses earn little taxable income. 
</P>
<P>
 He chides Brown for opposing the North American Free Trade Agreement and for 
endorsing health care plans that require employers to finance their workers' 
insurance. And he saves most of his firepower not for the big issues of the 
campaign, like crime or immigration, but for precisely what many of the people 
here want to discuss: workers' compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had first to set right what was wrong," he said. ". . . . It was a 
national disgrace. We were able to bring about reform." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is little of the personal Wilson on display; indeed, apart from 
mentioning a grandfather who was a police officer shot dead before Wilson was 
born, or introducing his wife, Gayle, the governor rarely treads into personal 
territory. Where Brown innately prefers the emotional connection, Wilson 
treasures toughness. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, he tailored his campaign spiel ever so slightly in recent days, 
since their recent debate clash on crime. The treasurer essentially accused 
Wilson of having no clue as to what it was like to be a woman or a mother 
concerned about societal violence. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Wilson's campaign speeches have been laced with a lament about fear 
faced by women who have to walk across a darkened parking lot or wait alone at 
a bus bench. The new version appeared to be insurance that he could connect 
himself -- as had Brown -- to the electorate's fear of crime. And it was 
telling, since for much of the campaign Brown has been the one tailoring her 
remarks to her opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is wrong," he said, "when a husband has to worry about his wife walking to 
her car at a day's end or walking to a bus stop. . . . I see a California where 
we change that."

CLINTON REJECTS RACIALLY BASED THEORY ON IQS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Injecting himself into a bitter and extremely sensitive national debate, 
President Clinton on Friday decisively rejected a new theory that black 
Americans are doomed to economic and social underachievement because they are 
intellectually inferior to whites and Asians. 
</P>
<P>
 At a White House press conference that touched on a broad range of domestic 
and foreign policy questions, Clinton was asked his opinion of an explosive new 
book which claims that African Americans as a group have lower IQ scores than 
whites and thus are fated to lag behind the majority of American society 
because intelligence is the chief determinant of success in modern America. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said that he had not read the book, "The Bell Curve," by conservative 
scholar Charles Murray and the late Harvard psychologist Richard Herrnstein. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Clinton said: "As I understand the argument of it, I have to say I 
disagree with the proposition that there are inherent racially based 
differences in the capacity of the American people to reach their full 
potential. I just don't agree with that. It goes against our entire history and 
our whole tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversial book does not say whether the measured difference in black 
and white IQ scores results from genetic differences or from the more difficult 
environment in which many blacks grow up. But the authors argue that the gap in 
part accounts for the pervasive poverty in black America. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton acknowledged that the question of race and poverty is "a very serious 
and complicated issue." He said that the answer should not be in finding 
scapegoats or creating pseudo-scientific categories but in trying to structure 
society and government to permit "every kid in this country to live up to the 
fullest of their potential." 
</P>
<P>
 On another racially charged question, Clinton defended his Justice 
Department's recent decision to support the firing of a white teacher in 
Piscataway, N.J., as part of the local school district's effort to promote 
racial diversity on its faculty. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the district had to choose between two identically qualified 
teachers, one black and one white, and that on "very narrow grounds" he 
supported the Justice Department's position supporting the district's decision 
to retain the black teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said that in a different circumstance -- a white teacher on a largely 
black faculty, for example -- he would support retaining the white teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning to the fall political campaign, Clinton said that -- despite the bleak 
outlook for Democrats nationwide -- prospects for his party had improved 
slightly in the last few days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want to peak too soon," the President joked. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton appeared resigned to large Democratic losses in both the House and the 
Senate, noting that the incumbent party almost always loses seats in midterm 
elections. Trying to put a positive spin on what is certain to be bad news on 
Nov. 8, Clinton said that the losses would be the result of "a lag between when 
you do something and when people feel it. And, of course, this is an extremely 
contentious time." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that he would abide by the voters' judgment, however harsh. And he 
vowed to press the new Congress to work with him as he tries to reform the 
nation's medical and welfare systems and bring greater accountability to 
Congress itself. 
</P>
<P>
 In an otherwise statesmanlike performance, Clinton could not resist a couple 
of hard partisan shots at Republicans Newt Gingrich and Oliver L. North. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that Gingrich had called him the "enemy of normal Americans," Clinton 
said that the Georgia representative, who aspires to be Speaker of the House, 
sometimes says and does "weird things." But he acknowledged that the atmosphere 
in Washington is "abnormal." 
</P>
<P>
 On North, Clinton strongly denied the Virginia Senate candidate's charge that 
he (Clinton) had promised former Virginia governor L. Douglas Wilder an 
ambassadorship in return for Wilder's endorsement of North's opponent, 
Democratic Sen. Charles S. Robb. 
</P>
<P>
 "That just did not happen. I would not do that," Clinton said. "I would never 
be part of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton added: "Now, you know, Oliver North says a lot of things and, you 
know, if you've got $17.5 million to buy your own version of the truth, then 
you don't have to be held apparently to the same standards that other people 
do. I noticed . . . he said that I wasn't his commander in chief. Someone asked 
me if it bothered me. I said it didn't bother me nearly as much as the fact he 
didn't act as if Ronald Reagan was his commander in chief either, when he had a 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton used his opening statement to remind voters of the Administration's 
changes in the student loan program, which he called "a very good deal" to help 
working families pay for college education. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the program would save taxpayers $4.3 billion and student 
borrowers $2 billion in lower fees. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to a question, Clinton said that First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton 
continues to have an active role in setting Administration policy on health 
care and other matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, you bet she does," Clinton said. He added that she is maintaining a 
full schedule of political appearances this fall and would be a central player 
as the Administration regroups and tries to put together a health care reform 
plan that it can sell to Congress and the public.

MAJOR ACCEPTS IRA CEASE-FIRE, OPENS BORDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In another long step toward peace in Northern Ireland, British Prime Minister 
John Major announced here Friday that he accepts the current cease-fire in the 
troubled province, and he ordered all border crossings opened. 
</P>
<P>
 The cease-fire now being observed by both sides in the long-running conflict 
is "intended to be permanent," Major said, and Britain will enter into talks 
with Sinn Fein, the political arm of the outlawed Irish Republican Army, 
"before this year is out." 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement indicated that, after 25 years of violence in Northern 
Ireland, leaders of all factions would be invited to sit at the same table to 
seek a solution that would satisfy both the majority Protestants, who want to 
retain British rule in the province, and minority Catholics, who want the 
British out. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to a luncheon of Belfast business people, Major said he is also 
lifting a British ban against Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams and Vice 
President Martin McGuinness, allowing them now to travel freely in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the prime minister said he will review the need for British army 
soldiers to patrol the streets of Northern Ireland and may begin turning 
policing over to the civilian Royal Ulster Constabulary. 
</P>
<P>
 During the cease-fire, the soldiers have kept a low profile, and army sources 
say that some units may now be returned to Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Major said the coming talks will address the sensitive matter of paramilitary 
groups turning in their weapons and explosives, but he did not make it a 
condition of any party joining the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime minister's announcement was hailed by most moderate leaders in 
Northern Ireland, particularly Protestant and Catholic clergymen. 
</P>
<P>
 The exception was the militant Protestant Rev. Ian Paisley, head of the 
Democratic Unionist Party, who charged that Major had "gone back on promises to 
the people of Northern Ireland over talks. He said the cease-fire had to be 
permanent." 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, the British government had insisted that the IRA and Sinn Fein must 
declare any cease-fire permanent -- as called for in last December's Downing 
Street Declaration signed by Major and Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds, 
which spelled out terms for peace talks. On Friday, Major said the IRA's 
adherence to the cease-fire was "more compelling than their words." 
</P>
<P>
 Paisley also declared that a surrendering of weapons by paramilitary forces 
should be made a condition of any peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Protestant Member of Parliament Ken Maginnis, a moderate, said of the Friday 
announcement: "It is risky but courageous. John Major is throwing down the 
gauntlet to the paramilitaries to keep the cease-fire." 
</P>
<P>
 The IRA announced a unilateral cease-fire on Aug. 31, which the group has 
observed. They were joined last week by the main Protestant Unionist 
paramilitary groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds and American leaders had pressured Major to accept that the 
cease-fire was working and join in talks with all parties north and south of 
the Irish border. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, President Clinton congratulated Northern Ireland's warring 
parties on their progress, calling the developments "very hopeful" and adding: 
"I am very glad that the United States has been able to be involved in this 
peace process in Northern Ireland." 
</P>
<P>
 Major, supported by British loyalist leaders in Northern Ireland, urged 
caution Friday, but he apparently is now convinced that the cease-fire will 
hold long enough for talks to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am now prepared to make a working assumption that the cease-fire is 
intended to be permanent," he said. "If we can continue reasonably to assume 
that Sinn Fein is establishing a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods, if 
the IRA continues to show that it has ended terrorism, then we shall be ready 
to convene exploratory talks before this year is out." 
</P>
<P>
 "If the cease-fire breaks down," one commentator here said, "the prime 
minister can't be blamed for trying." 
</P>
<P>
 And Major himself, under drizzly skies, visited border areas Friday. In 
Dungannon, he told well-wishers: "I hope the violence is over. If not, it was 
not for want of trying." 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 88 border crossings will be opened, thus easing the burden of rural 
farmers who have relatives and business interests on both sides of the border 
with the Republic of Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 Major said in his speech that his strategy "is to make sure that the violence 
is over for good. We must aim to make a return to violence unthinkable." 
</P>
<P>
 Sinn Fein's McGuinness said of Major's announcement: "I think we have seen the 
British government at last moving in the right direction. We are heading for a 
melting pot of talks, where eventually the British government ends its 
jurisdiction over Northern Ireland." 
</P>
<P>
 But striking an ominous note, a former Sinn Fein and IRA chief accused Adams 
of betrayal and warned that a new terrorist group will emerge to fight British 
control of the province. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruairi O'Bradaigh, said to have been an IRA chief during the 1960s, told the 
Belfast Telegraph that the IRA cease-fire is permanent, because the leadership 
has been "constitutionalized." But in the nature of the long struggle, he said, 
another group would rise up to take its place. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Major will meet Reynolds in England to discuss the next steps in 
arranging all-party peace talks.

CLINTON, FEINSTEIN DECLARE OPPOSITION TO PROP. 187; IMMIGRATION: PRESIDENT 
CALLS MEASURE UNCONSTITUTIONAL. SENATOR ADMITS HER STANCE COULD COST HER THE 
ELECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In the latest escalation of the debate surrounding Proposition 187, President 
Clinton and Democrat Sen. Dianne Feinstein on Friday publicly assailed the 
hotly contested California ballot initiative that would bar illegal immigrants 
from receiving many public services. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, responding at length to a question at a nationally televised White 
House news conference, said the ballot measure is an unconstitutional proposal 
that if implemented could cause increased crime and the spread of disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you turn the teacher and other educators into instruments of a sort of 
state police force, it's like bringing a Big Brother into the schools," Clinton 
said, alluding to the proposition mandate that schools verify the immigration 
status of students and their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein, in a close race with Republican challenger Rep. Mike Huffington, 
also declared her opposition to the popular measure -- a step that she 
acknowledged may well lead to her defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that this could cost me votes, quite possibly even the election," 
Feinstein said during a luncheon speech to the Commonwealth Club in San 
Francisco. "But I simply do not believe it will work." 
</P>
<P>
 The comments by Clinton and Feinstein dramatically illustrated how the 
once-obscure proposal -- largely the brainchild of a group of Orange 
County-based activists and former Immigration and Naturalization Service 
officials -- has leaped to the forefront of the national agenda, with less than 
three weeks before the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 The senator's announcement came one day after Huffington (R-Santa Barbara) 
endorsed the measure and Feinstein accused Huffington of backing Proposition 
187 because of its strong support among likely voters -- especially 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 "His endorsement is the politically expedient thing to do," Feinstein said. "I 
read the polls and know that a majority of Californians support it. No way do I 
question the sincerity of working Californians, for I'm as fed up with the 
situation as they (are). But I believe Proposition 187 won't solve the problem, 
it'll only make it worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said he joined the pro-187 camp out of conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what the people of California want," Huffington said when contacted 
Friday after his opponent's statement. "I think Mrs. Feinstein is out of touch 
with what the people want. But it's not just this issue, it's her entire record 
in Washington that will cost her the election." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Proposition 187's promi nent injection into the Senate race, some 
analysts said its significance on Nov. 8 is anything but certain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now my guess is that other issues and personalities will decide that 
race," said Arnold Steinberg, a political strategist whose clients are 
primarily Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 A Democratic consultant said the immigration debate -- and voters' apparent 
support for Proposition 187 -- would help Huffington and hurt Feinstein, though 
he added: "Maybe not enough to make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of Proposition 187 lauded the anti-initiative statements from 
Clinton and Feinstein, the latest in a steady drumbeat of opposition to the 
measure from prominent Democrats as well as several Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Californians are reading their voters' pamphlets right now, and their 
decisions are being aided, we hope, by an incredible diversity of people in 
opposition to Proposition 187," said Joel Maliniak, spokesman for Taxpayers 
Against 187, leading the anti-initiative campaign. "Support for Proposition 187 
is eroding and collapsing," Maliniak said.  
</P>
<P>
 But Harold W. Ezell, a Proposition 187 co-author, said the comments by Clinton 
and Feinstein would only boost voter support for the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our ratings are higher than theirs," said Ezell, a former regional 
commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, who contended 
that the campaign against the measure had now peaked. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's their final salvo," Ezell said of Clinton's statement. "That's their 
Scud missile." 
</P>
<P>
 In explaining their opposition to the proposition, Clinton and Feinstein 
emphasized two oft-cited potential impacts: an increase in crime by those 
youngsters denied schooling and left on their own on the streets, and a spread 
of disease by immigrants who would be unable to obtain immunizations and other 
health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein also cited high implementation costs -- more than $100 million, 
according to state estimates -- and the prospective loss of about $15 billion 
in U.S. aid to California because of conflict with federal laws and 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the President and the senator also said it was unwise to pursue a measure 
that was clearly unconstitutional, a reference to a 1982 Supreme Court decision 
barring states from denying public education to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think as a matter of practice it's a good thing to condition an 
election referendum, much less other elections in California, on a measure that 
even the supporters say is unconstitutional," said Clinton, who was clearly 
well-versed in the debate surrounding the measure and was prepared to respond 
to the question. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 supporters, including Gov. Pete Wilson, argue that it is time 
for the Supreme Court to revisit the issue of providing public education to 
illegal immigrants. Initiative proponents predict that its passage will prompt 
many illegal immigrants to go home and dissuade others from coming, while 
forcing Washington to act to reduce the flow. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a message initiative and we're sending a message to Washington, to 
Sacramento: Enough's enough," said Robert R. Kiley, a Yorba Linda-based 
political consultant who is among Proposition 187's founders. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's rejection of Proposition 187 culminates a series of remarks by 
Administration officials outlining their objections to the controversial ballot 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also took a thinly veiled swipe at Wilson by contending that previous 
"leadership decisions" in California had encouraged illicit immigration to spur 
economic growth during the state's "good times." 
</P>
<P>
 The President was apparently alluding to then-Sen. Wilson's support of the 
Special Agricultural Worker provision of the 1986 Immigration Reform and 
Control Act, which led to the legalization of more than 1 million formerly 
undocumented farm workers. Wilson has contended that although he voted for the 
final measure, he had sought much narrower provisions than the 
Democrat-controlled Congress approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who has made immigration a centerpiece of his reelection campaign, 
blasted Clinton's statements and accused the White House of acting belatedly 
and inadequately to bolster enforcement along the California-Mexico border in a 
pre-election bid to influence California voters. "The federal government has 
ignored the border," Wilson said. "People are fed up. They know how unfair it 
is to get stuck with the costs of illegal immigration."

GAMING TRADE BETS ON HOGE IN ASSEMBLY HORSE RACE; POLITICS: REPUBLICAN WHO 
REPRESENTS SUNLAND-TUJUNGA RECEIVED $140,000 FROM THE INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 He's not an entrenched member of the power elite, not a chairman of an 
influential legislative committee, and not a veteran politician with years 
enough behind him to buy a lot of clout in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 He's a freshman lawmaker, in fact, a newcomer who first set foot inside the 
Assembly chambers barely two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But some powerful special interests -- most notably the gaming and 
horse-racing industries -- have showered Assemblyman Bill Hoge (R-Pasadena) 
with campaign funds as if he were more than just another first-termer seeking 
reelection on Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 In a race that not only is a prime partisan showdown but has grabbed attention 
with allegations that Hoge is a special friend of the gambling industry, the 
dollar signs are quickly stacking up. Far fewer of them are ending up with 
former Pasadena Police Chief Bruce Philpott, Hoge's Democratic opponent in the 
44th Assembly District that stretches from Sunland-Tujunga to the San Gabriel 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Records at the secretary of state's office show that, since Jan. 1, 1992, Hoge 
has received $140,000 in contributions from horse owners, racing associations, 
card clubs and a major Nevada casino. That's more than any of the other 26 
freshmen lawmakers who, in 1992, flooded the Capitol with new faces and new 
resolve to dodge special-interest politics amid the reality of term limits. 
</P>
<P>
 What exactly made Hoge a darling of the racing industry is not clear, and Hoge 
himself isn't saying. One racing executive, Cliff Goodrich of the Los Angeles 
Turf Club, said he is aware that Hoge has been "practically a lifelong fan" of 
horse racing. There are no tracks or card clubs in Hoge's district. 
</P>
<P>
 The contribution tallies, combined with Hoge's record of authoring and voting 
for gambling-industry bills, has turned heads in some Sacramento circles. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling him "one of the worst offenders" among perpetual fund-raisers, Ruth 
Holton, head of the watchdog group Common Cause, said: "Whenever an elected 
official takes a lot of money from any one interest or industry and then votes 
for the industry or authors its bills, voters have a right to be concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), who seeks tighter regulation of 
California's rapidly expanding gambling industry, said Hoge broke with protocol 
by moving so quickly to align himself with horse-racing interests. "This is a 
case of the speed-up of the special-interest process," Hayden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoge ranked No. 1 in Common Cause's study of freshman "off-year" fund-raising, 
garnering $262,128 in 1993, a year with no election to pay for. So far this 
year, Hoge reports collecting donations totaling $374,872, with a little more 
than $180,645 on hand as of Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Philpott, by comparison, has raised about $100,000 in total contributions, and 
as of Sept. 30. was $6,000 in the red. His big expenditures are cable-TV ads 
that highlight the large sums his opponent has accepted from gaming backers. 
Without a big war chest to spread his message, Philpott was hoping to focus 
public attention on Hoge's gambling contributions and the fact that they pour 
in from outside the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoge, 48, an insurance executive who bills himself as tough on crime and a 
conservative tax fighter, did not respond to requests for an interview. Brent 
ten Pas, his campaign spokesman, would say only that the assemblyman was too 
busy meeting with constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 To counter Philpott's charges, Ten Pas said: "Philpott is taking money from 
(Assembly Speaker) Willie Brown and the state party, who also take gambling 
contributions. Mr. Hoge has over 1,000 people in his district who have 
contributed to his campaign. He has received five times the amount of 
in-district contributions as his opponent." 
</P>
<P>
 Philpott concedes he is getting Democratic Party help in paying campaign 
bills. He said he does not knowingly accept any contributions from the gambling 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Pledging to seek campaign-finance reform if elected, Philpott charged that 
Hoge has been corrupted by special-interest contributions. "He has learned a 
system that is very corrosive. He's learned the value of it, the culture of 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Philpott, 50, retired from the Pasadena Police Department in 1991, after 28 
years of service. He and Hoge both have collected fistfuls of law-enforcement 
endorsements, but Philpott is dogged by an episode that Hoge's campaign brings 
up repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Philpott had a run-in with Glendale police during which officers 
pulled him over for speeding and playing loud music. Because Philpott's date 
was an African American woman, he suggested the stop was racially motivated. 
But Hoge's people say Philpott concocted the racial implications. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoge was first recruited as a candidate by like-minded conservative Republican 
Pat Nolan, the former Glendale assemblyman who now is among a handful of former 
lawmakers serving federal prison time for crossing the barrier that is supposed 
to separate campaign contributions from legislative action. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan gave tens of thousands to Hoge's first campaign and urged other 
lawmakers to do so as well. And this year, Assembly Republican leader Jim 
Brulte (R-Rancho Cucamonga) has pumped $70,000 into Hoge's race, identifying it 
as a key contest for the Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoge also gets help from the Allied Business PAC, the powerhouse Christian 
Right political action committee led by Republican state Sen. Rob Hurtt of 
Orange County. Hurtt has directed at least $54,000 to Hoge's camp since 1992, 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Legislature, Hoge sits on the Assembly Governmental Organization 
Committee, which considers all gambling bills in the Assembly. He has authored 
six bills to benefit horse racing or card clubs and has cast a number of votes 
in favor of those interests. For example, Hoge cast the deciding vote in 
committee in favor of a bill allowing slot machines at racetracks. That 
legislation, however, was stopped in the next committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Friendly, a former Los Angeles television producer who now breeds and 
raises a stable of 50 racehorses, sees Hoge's support as vital to a 
multibillion-dollar California industry whose trickle-down impact produces 
billions more for other businesses in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "What attracted me to Bill is that there are very, very few people in the 
Legislature who understand our business," Friendly said in an interview. "Not 
only is he protective of horse racing, but of the whole back-up agricultural 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Friendly, who sought and received Hoge's vote on a bill benefiting a 
thoroughbred-owners group that he heads, had given $7,000 to the assemblyman's 
campaign as of Sept. 30. Three other officers of the group sent Hoge's campaign 
committee another $5,000. The bill was signed into law and it goes into effect 
Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest racing contribution given to Hoge over the past three years is 
$31,500 from the Los Angeles Turf Club Inc., operator of races at Santa Anita, 
located just outside Hoge's district. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoge authored a bill for the Turf Club to open up new avenues for betting at 
tracks. Critics sounded an alarm that it would have allowed betting on 
simulated, "virtual-reality" racing, an accusation the Turf Club denied. The 
bill died in committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it would help us to have somebody up there in Sacramento who knew 
horse racing," said Goodrich, the Turf Club's president and chief operating 
officer. "Bill is also pro-business, not only pro-racetrack business. He knows 
the importance of jobs. Obviously, he has a feel for our industry. He has 
helped us, and that's why we are supporting him." 
</P>
<P>
 Sue Ross, the legislative coordinator for the California Horse Racing Board, a 
state regulatory agency, said Hoge pays attention to horse racing like no other 
freshman legislator has. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has spent a lot of time trying to learn the ins and outs of horse-racing 
law," Ross said. "A couple of times I've gone over to his office and we've 
spent a couple of hours each time going over the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Track wagers add up to $3 billion a year in California, and state officials 
figure that horse racing indirectly pumps another $3 billion into the economy. 
The state's cut of every betting dollar -- 4 or 5 cents -- amounts to more than 
$100 million a year for the General Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most controversial Hoge bill was the one that would have expanded 
opportunities for card rooms under certain circumstances without voter 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 It was vetoed by Gov. Pete Wilson, who reiterated the importance of giving 
voters say-so over the location of card rooms.  
</P>
<P>
 The bill was sponsored by the California Commerce Club card room, which 
contributed $2,500 to Hoge in 1993 and 1994. Hoge also received $2,000 from the 
Bell Gardens Bicycle Club, another card room, in 1993 and 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same period, Hoge also received $12,000 from Caesar's World, whose top 
executive, Terrence J. Lanni, a racehorse owner, contributed another $3,500. 
Contributions and Legislation 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Bill Hoge (R-Pasadena) has turned heads in the Legislature because 
of gambling industry contributions his campaign committee has accepted. Since 
Jan. 1, 1992, he has received from horse racing, card-room or casino interests 
$140,000 of his nearly $1 million in total contributions. The following is a 
partial list of big contributions and the gambling legislation he has authored. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Other directors: $5,000 Legislation 
</P>
<P>
 AB 274 (Hoge): Parimutuel wagering. Sponsored by the Los Angeles Turf Club. 
This bill would have expanded the number of bets that could be placed on a 
race. For example, bettors could wager on one horse beating another in the 
field, regardless of whether the horse places or wins. The bill was defeated 
after critics warned that one of the outcomes of the bill would be to allow for 
betting on simulated "virtual reality"-style races. The bill also dealt with 
satellite wagering. 
</P>
<P>
 AB 2137 (Hoge): Gaming clubs. Sponsored by the California Commerce Club. 
Hoge's early version of this bill would have allowed card rooms, racing groups 
and satellite wagering facilities to enforce collection of gambling debts 
incurred on credit. In the face of opposition by Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, that 
portion of the bill was eliminated. Gov. Pete Wilson later vetoed the bill, 
warning that it would have allowed card rooms to locate in some communities 
without voter approval under certain circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 AB 2935 (Hoge): Unclaimed tickets. Sponsored by the California Horse Racing 
Board. This bill, which was signed into law, designated May 15 as the annual 
deadline by which unclaimed ticket holders could cash in their tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 AB 2936 (Hoge): Equine medication. Sponsored by the California Horse Racing 
Board. This bill, signed into law, defined prohibited drug substances for 
racehorses. 
</P>
<P>
 AB 2514 (Hoge): Gaming. Sponsor unclear. This bill required voter approval for 
existing card rooms and had similarities to AB 2137. It died in committee. 
</P>
<P>
 AB 2577 (Hoge): Parimutuel Wagering. This bill contained provisions similar to 
AB 274 in that it would have expanded opportunities for wagering. It died in 
committee.

 FALLOUT: Thousands of teachers will be put out of work, and some campuses may 
even have to shut down if Prop. 187 passes and is enforced, Los Angeles Unified 
School District officials say (B1). . . . Board of Education President Mark 
Slavkin said Friday that the district stands to lose up to $628 million in 
federal funds. "This is very real for all students," Slavkin said."There is no 
surplus, no savings, no extra money generated for schools to use."

 POPE'S PROSE: Pope John Paul II's new book, "Crossing the Threshold of Hope," 
which arrived at bookstores Thursday, should help "humanize him as a figure," 
says Gabriel Meyer, associate editor of the National Catholic Register, an 
Encino-based weekly. . . . The Pope shares very personal stories about his 
youth, Meyer said, showing "he is not just a law and order man."

 NEW WEAPON: Often left in the dark in their war against gangs, police in Van 
Nuys Friday took possession of a new, high-tech weapon widely employed in the 
Persian Gulf War -- night vision scopes that will give them sharper, lighter 
images (B1). . . . "One of the problems has been that they have seen us before 
we see them," says Van Nuys Captain James McMurray. "I think we just changed 
the balance." Michael Arkush

OSCAR WINNER BURT LANCASTER DIES AT 80 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Burt Lancaster, the performer, producer, gymnast and iconoclast -- who from 
his earliest beginnings was always a star -- has died, his wife announced 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 80-year-old Academy Award winner and onetime top athlete had been in 
failing health since suffering a stroke nearly four years ago. He died 
overnight Thursday of a heart attack in their Century City condominium, Susan 
Lancaster said, adding that there will be no funeral and that burial will be 
private. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster had been in relative seclusion since he was hospitalized in Los 
Alamitos in November, 1990. He suffered the stroke while visiting a friend in 
Orange County and lately had refused visitors, even such old friends as Kirk 
Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
 The stroke proved the last in a series of physical maladies that had befallen 
the virile and versatile star of more than 70 films. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983 he underwent multiple coronary artery bypass surgery, and he continued 
to suffer from a heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he filmed "Little Treasure" six months after the surgery and 
continued working steadily in film and television, Lancaster was denied the 
title role in "Old Gringo" in 1988 because of his health. Columbia Pictures 
decided that insurance on him would be too expensive, and cast Gregory Peck 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lancaster bounced back from that setback to give a heralded performance in 
"Field of Dreams" in 1989, portraying Moonlight Graham, a onetime ballplayer 
who had a brief brush with athletic glory before becoming a physician. 
</P>
<P>
 With that role, as with dozens of others throughout his lengthy acting career, 
it was as though Lancaster had been born for his chosen work. 
</P>
<P>
 Some actors struggle upward through minor roles to second leads to star 
status; others cite an academic preparation, beginning with collegiate drama 
courses and progressing through Actors Studio and summer stock to professional 
acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster took no courses and played no second leads, but was a bona fide star 
from his first screen appearance in 1946 until a few years before his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes his career accomplishments seemed almost too numerous to be real, 
much less recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 The Academy Award he won for "Elmer Gantry" in 1960 and the Venice Film 
Festival award he received two years later for "The Birdman of Alcatraz" were 
remembered. But many forgot the earlier Oscar he had shared with Harold Hecht 
as co-producer of "Marty," which was voted best picture of 1955. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster's work in such major dramatic productions as "Come Back Little 
Sheba," "From Here to Eternity," "Judgment at Nuremberg," "The Rainmaker," 
"Seven Days in May" and "Atlantic City" tended to overshadow his work in such 
films as "Trapeze," "The Flame and the Arrow" and "The Crimson Pirate," which 
displayed the lighter side of his nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Notified of Lancaster's death, Kirk Douglas said their 50-year relationship 
had been precious. Douglas said that after he survived a helicopter crash a few 
years ago, he came to realize "just how important life and friends really 
were." 
</P>
<P>
 "Burt was not just an actor," Douglas added. "He was a curious intellectual 
with an abiding love of opera who was constantly in search of unique characters 
to portray. . . . Elmer Gantry . . . the Birdman of Alcatraz." 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling the films he and Lancaster had made together and the dozens of other 
pictures that featured the outspoken onetime floorwalker and salesman, Douglas 
said: 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, Burt isn't really dead. . . . People years from now will still be 
seeing us shooting at each other . . . still watching him in his many other 
great films. At least he's at peace now." 
</P>
<P>
 Burton Stephen Lancaster was born Nov. 2, 1913, in the East Harlem section of 
New York City, attended Public School 83 and DeWitt Clinton High School, and 
often said he might have "grown up to be either a cop or a criminal (his 
brother became a policeman; several of his childhood playmates would end up in 
Sing Sing) if it had not been for athletics and the public library." 
</P>
<P>
 He was 6 feet, 2 inches tall by the time he was 14, with a husky physique and 
quick reflexes that won him an athletic scholarship to New York University. An 
alert and retentive mind gave him a lifelong fondness for books. But formal 
education began to bore him by the middle of his sophomore year and he quit 
college to join the circus. 
</P>
<P>
 He teamed up with boyhood friend and gymnastic partner Nick Cravat -- who 
later joined him for on-camera stunts in "The Crimson Pirate" and "The Flame 
and the Arrow" -- and formed the acrobatic team of Lang and Cravat, getting a 
job with the Kay Bros. show at a salary of $3 per week and three meals a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew," he said in later years, "that I'd found the kind of thing I wanted 
to do for the rest of my life -- the only question was what part of the 
business would be best." 
</P>
<P>
 From 1932 to 1937, the team of Lang and Cravat worked steadily: the Kay Bros. 
engagement gave way to a similar (but better-paid) one with Gorman Bros. 
Circus. This was followed by a switch to the Barnett Bros. traveling show, and 
finally to a tour with Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey -- then, as now, the 
very top of the circus world in North America. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it didn't feel quite right," he said. "I felt something was lacking. 
Hell, I wanted to talk. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 So he quit the act for a while to appear with the Depression-era Works 
Progress Administration Theater Project. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it didn't really work out for me," he told interviewers over the years. 
"I had formed the habit of eating three meals a day, and that was hard to do on 
what the Theater Project could afford. So back I went to Lang and Cravat." 
</P>
<P>
 But not for long. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks after his return to the circus, one of his fingers became infected 
and a doctor gave him a choice: give up professional acrobatics, or face 
amputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided to keep my finger," he said, "and went looking for a different kind 
of job -- outside the circus, even outside the field of entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next three years he was, by turns, a floorwalker in the lingerie 
department of the Marshall Field store in Chicago, a salesman in the same 
store's haberdashery department, a firefighter, a truck driver and an engineer 
for a meatpacking plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to New York, he found a job with the Columbia Concerts Bureau (a CBS 
network subsidiary supplying music to small towns across the nation). But 
before he was able to assume his new duties as a booking agent, he received his 
draft notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a wonderful time," he said, "touring North Africa, Italy and Austria as 
page-turner for a soldier pianist!" 
</P>
<P>
 The World War II years did lead to one important contact, however. 
</P>
<P>
 That was with a USO entertainer named Norma Anderson. They kept in touch 
throughout the rest of the war, and as soon as it was over, he used his 45-day 
discharge furlough and travel voucher to look her up in New York, where she was 
working for a radio producer. 
</P>
<P>
 He was in the elevator, on the way to her office, when he became aware of a 
fellow passenger staring at him. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got off at Norma's floor," he said, "the guy followed, and I have to 
admit he was really beginning to worry me when he pulled out a business card." 
</P>
<P>
 The man identified himself as an associate of stage producer Irving Jacobs and 
he invited Lancaster to read for the part of a tough sergeant in a new play 
called "A Sound of Hunting." 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster got the part and although the play only survived for five weeks, 
reviewers were unanimous in their praise. They brought film scouts to the play 
and seven screen contract offers resulted. 
</P>
<P>
 But he accepted none of them. Instead, he signed with Hecht, who came 
backstage to make an offer no one else had, telling Lancaster, "In five years 
we'll be making our own pictures." 
</P>
<P>
 They shook hands on that, and began a business association that yielded an 
almost unbroken supply of movies, millions and Oscars for the next 
quarter-century. 
</P>
<P>
 Hecht's first move was to sign Lancaster to a contract with Hal Wallis calling 
for two pictures a year; the fledgling actor boarded a train for Hollywood, 
ready to begin work at once on a film titled "Desert Fury." But on arrival he 
discovered that the script was not ready. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Mark Hellinger, however, had seen a Lancaster screen test, and wanted 
him for the doomed hero role of Swede in "The Killers," based on Ernest 
Hemingway's short story. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture was released in 1946, and Lancaster became an instant star. 
</P>
<P>
 He followed with the "Desert Fury" role, and then returned to the Hellinger 
fold for "Brute Force," a prison epic that firmly established his stellar 
qualities and gave him, in the words of Daily Variety, "added marquee stature." 
</P>
<P>
 His next role, a true departure from the hard-guy characters he had played in 
the past, was as the upright son of a war profiteer in "All My Sons," adapted 
from the Arthur Miller play. 
</P>
<P>
 The year 1948 was a watershed; in its final months, future Variety editor 
Thomas Pryor observed that Lancaster was "at the top of the Hollywood heap. His 
name on a theater marquee is said to be worth at least $1 million." 
</P>
<P>
 Hecht had promised that they would make their own films, and both men still 
wanted to do so, but their path seemed to be blocked by the studio system that 
still ruled the film world. 
</P>
<P>
 So they decided to buck the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Norma Productions (named for the former Norma Anderson, who became Lancaster's 
wife in 1946) began production with a moody melodrama, "Kiss the Blood Off My 
Hands." That was followed by a return to studio work with "Sorry, Wrong 
Number," a screen version of the classic radio monologue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rope of Sand" and "Criss Cross" followed, and the next year the production 
company made a deal with Warner Bros. that allowed it to make three independent 
films for Warner release, while Lancaster made three others for the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 That same year, Lancaster returned briefly to his original profession, joining 
Cole Bros. Circus for four weeks as an acrobat (with what one magazine called a 
"careful salary adjustment" from the $3 plus meals he had been paid for his 
first big-top job.) 
</P>
<P>
 The acrobatics set the tone for Lancaster's first independent production at 
Warner: "The Flame and the Arrow" paired him once again with his old partner 
Cravat for slightly tongue-in-cheek medieval derring-do. The critics were 
ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not since Douglas Fairbanks (Sr.) was leaping from castle walls and vaulting 
over rooftops of ancient storybook towns," wrote New York Times critic Bosley 
Crowther, "has the screen had such a reckless and acrobatic young man to 
display these same inclinations." 
</P>
<P>
 Exploitation of his athletic prowess opened a whole new facet of Lancaster's 
career; he pursued it through "Jim Thorpe -- All American," "Ten Tall Men" and 
"The Crimson Pirate." 
</P>
<P>
 Then it was back to the studio and to deep drama with a strong portrayal of 
the alcoholic Doc opposite Shirley Booth in "Come Back Little Sheba," followed 
by "His Majesty O'Keefe" for his own company. 
</P>
<P>
 Outdoor epics such as "Apache," "Vera Cruz" and "The Kentuckian" (Lancaster's 
first directing effort) were balanced by dramatic performances in "The Rose 
Tattoo" and "Separate Tables" and the co-production role in "Marty." 
</P>
<P>
 "Trapeze," a foreign circus romp with Tony Curtis and Gina Lollobrigida, was 
followed by "The Sweet Smell of Success," again opposite Curtis, in which 
Lancaster played an evil, power-mad, syndicated columnist -- thereby gaining 
the enduring enmity of Walter Winchell, who complained that it was a biting 
satire of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster and his partners (Norma Productions had been renamed 
Hecht-Hill-Lancaster when James Hill joined the company) found themselves at 
the center of a storm of abuse from members of the news media responding to 
Winchell's invocation of the mid-1950s mood of anti-liberalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster's reaction was a sharp increase in the amount of free time he 
devoted to liberal causes of all kinds. Gradually the attacks ended. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1969 breakup of his marriage (after 23 years and five children) left him 
depressed for a time, but work was an anodyne, as always. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Midnight Man" (which he co-wrote, co-produced and co-directed) gave him a 
chance to stretch his professional muscles. "The Cassandra Crossing," 
"Twilight's Last Gleaming" and "The Island of Dr. Moreau" were more standard 
offerings. But "Go Tell the Spartans," with its anti-Vietnam War message, was 
Lancaster at his full-throttle best. 
</P>
<P>
 He also made two excursions back to the stage. One (the 1972 role as 
one-legged Peter Stuyvesant in the musical "Knickerbocker Holiday") was a 
success; the other (as an aging Huck Finn opposite Kirk Douglas' Tom Sawyer for 
"The Boys in Autumn" in 1981) was less so. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1983 film "Local Hero" saw him reinterpreting the role of unprincipled 
tycoon that he had played in various forms before -- and playing it well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to play character roles now," he said in a 1977 interview. "In fact, I 
mustn't play romantic ones unless it logically suits my real age." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it was a romantic role -- as the elderly chronic loser dreaming of a happy 
life with Susan Sarandon in "Atlantic City" -- that won him the Los Angeles and 
New York film critics' awards in 1981 and nearly brought his second performance 
Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Lancaster was lauded for work on behalf of social causes. In 
1984, he received the Mental Health Award from the UC Irvine Department of 
Psychiatry for his work on a series of videotapes about the problems of the 
long-term mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, he was honored as Man of the Year by Aid for AIDS after he posed for 
a poster captioned "Think before you act . . . don't get AIDS." The poster was 
used as an educational tool in Los Angeles Unified School District classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 And he continued to work as often as possible. In 1988 he had lent his own 
life experience to "Rocket Gibraltar" as a grandfather who insists that his 
grandchildren give him a Viking funeral on a burning boat drifting to sea. The 
same year he traveled to Italy and Yugoslavia to portray a cardinal in an 
Italian miniseries based on Alessandro Manzoni's novel "I Promessi Sposi" ("The 
Promised Bride.") 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1990, he married television production coordinator Susan 
Scherer, who was 48. 
</P>
<P>
 But the good roles by then were fewer and further between. 
</P>
<P>
 "Meanwhile, you're marking time," he told The Times' Charles Champlin. "You're 
like a fighter. No fights but you keep in great shape. It was three years 
before 'Atlantic City' came along, and 'Rocket Gibraltar' was the best part 
since. Just so they keep coming along."

CLINTON WILL VISIT SYRIA TO PUSH PEACE; MIDEAST: THE PRESIDENT WILL STOP IN 
DAMASCUS DURING A THREE-DAY TRIP IN WHICH HE WILL WITNESS THE SIGNING OF AN 
ISRAEL-JORDAN TREATY. HE SAYS TERRORISM WILL NOT DETER HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton said Friday that he will visit Damascus next week to prod 
President Hafez Assad to move faster in peace negotiations with Israel, despite 
Syria's generation-long links to international terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
 The President plans to stop in the Syrian capital as part of a hectic 
three-day tour of the Middle East to celebrate the signing of the Israel-Jordan 
peace treaty ending almost half a century of animosity. He also plans to 
address both the Israeli and Jordanian parliaments, visit U.S. forces in 
Kuwait, confer with the monarchs of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia and meet in Cairo 
with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said at a news conference Friday that a bloody terrorist bombing in 
the heart of Tel Aviv this week made him even more determined to go ahead with 
the trip, which he said will dramatize U.S. support for the Middle East peace 
process. He said that the radical Islamic organization Hamas perpetrated the 
bombing to sabotage Israel's negotiations with the Palestine Liberation 
Organization and Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is terribly important, especially since there have been violent 
reactions from the enemies of peace, that the United States stand with the 
friends of peace and the champions of peace at this time," Clinton said. "It is 
even more important than it would have been a few days ago that I go there and 
that our country stick up for this." 
</P>
<P>
 He brushed aside questions about his own safety, saying that he has confidence 
in the U.S. Secret Service and the security forces of the countries he will 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said Syria played no role in the Tel Aviv bombing or in other 
recent acts of terrorism in Israel. However, the State Department has long 
included Syria on its list of countries that support international terrorism. 
In the latest report, the department said the Damascus regime "continues to 
provide support and safe haven" for terrorist groups that target Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said he will urge Assad to curb Damascus-based terrorist 
organizations, but the main purpose of the meeting is to attempt to accelerate 
the ponderous pace of the Israel-Syria talks.  
</P>
<P>
 "I do not believe that we can permit (Syrian support of terrorism) to keep us 
from pursuing a comprehensive peace as long as nothing in our peace agreements 
undermines our commitment to end terrorism," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Clinton and Assad will not have 
enough time together to engage in detailed negotiations. But he said the 
meeting "can inspire Assad to move the process forward." 
</P>
<P>
 The Syrian president covets the international recognition that accompanies a 
visit by a U.S. President to Damascus, and U.S. officials hope that the meeting 
will result in some sort of gesture toward the Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior State Department official said later that the visit "gives us a 
chance to concentrate their minds." 
</P>
<P>
 Syrian and Israeli officials have not met face-to-face for months, so the 
negotiations are being conducted through American go-betweens, primarily 
Christopher. The secretary of state said he will resume Jerusalem-Damascus 
shuttle diplomacy "when the parties are ready for me to come back," probably 
within a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent terrorist incidents have produced a backlash in Israel against the 
peace process, which could make it more difficult for Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin to strike a compromise with Assad. But U.S. officials said Rabin probably 
can continue the negotiations unless there is a terrorist attack linked 
directly to Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior State Department official said Assad will probably rein in 
Damascus-based terrorist groups, at least as long as the negotiations seem to 
be productive, because the Syrian president knows that "if Rabin's political 
space disappears, it will not be possible to reach an agreement with Syria." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's trip is the most extensive one to the Middle East by a U.S. 
President since Richard Nixon toured the region in 1974, less than a year after 
Israel's war with Egypt and Syria. Clinton is the first President to visit 
Damascus since Nixon, although former Presidents Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan 
and George Bush all met Assad in Europe. Clinton and Assad met in Geneva last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton used the news conference to claim credit for a recent string of 
foreign policy successes, including the signing Friday in Geneva of an 
agreement intended to curtail North Korea's nuclear weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good deal for the United States," he said. "North Korea will freeze 
and then dismantle its nuclear program. South Korea and our other allies will 
be better protected. The entire world will be safer as we slow the spread of 
nuclear weapons." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the agreement was signed, South Korea announced the cancellation 
of a joint U.S.-South Korea military exercise scheduled for later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also hailed the return of elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to 
Haiti and Iraq's retreat from the Kuwaiti border in the face of a U.S. military 
buildup in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these things are the accumulation of two years of hard work, trying 
to fashion the national security of the United States and advance the economic 
interest of the United States and advance democracy in the post-Cold War 
world," he said. "A lot of these things have come together in a short time." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Defense Secretary John M. Deutch later wrapped the last two weeks in a 
mantle of hyperbole. "This has been the best week or two weeks we've seen in 
national security in about 200 years," he said.

NEWS ANALYSIS; CLINTON BELATEDLY BECOMING A FOREIGN POLICY PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At a White House meeting during the crisis over Iraq's troop movements near 
Kuwait, a high-ranking official suddenly noticed something new: President 
Clinton had taken charge of the details of his own foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was ticking off a list of things he wanted done, messages to foreign 
governments, one, two, three," the official said. "It was a much more 
operational kind of involvement than we saw earlier." 
</P>
<P>
 After 21 months of focusing largely on domestic affairs -- "like a laser 
beam," he once promised -- Clinton is belatedly turning into a foreign policy 
President. 
</P>
<P>
 Like all his predecessors since World War II, the President is finding that, 
when things break right, international issues can be exhilarating -- and can 
help project an image of strong leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, things have been breaking right. 
</P>
<P>
 From Iraq and Israel to Haiti and North Korea, Clinton has run up a string of 
foreign policy successes, a new experience for a President whose first year was 
marked by international setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Republican blockade of Clinton's domestic proposals in 
Congress has made international tangles such as the Arab-Israeli conflict look 
tractable. 
</P>
<P>
 With his public approval rating bumping along at just above 40%, Clinton may 
well find a warmer welcome in the Mideast than the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Political aides said they are not sure his visits to Jerusalem and Kuwait City 
next week will help Democrats in Jacksonville and Kansas City, but they can 
hardly hurt. (A Times Poll released this week showed a marked upturn in 
approval of the President's foreign policy, from 36% a month ago to 48% now, 
but little change in his overall popularity.) 
</P>
<P>
 At his news conference Friday, Clinton acknowledged that until recently, "I 
never would have anticipated going to the Middle East" in the middle of a 
congressional election campaign. But he argued that any foreign policy success 
he is enjoying now is "just a simple coincidence" after "two years of work." 
</P>
<P>
 More important -- and more than coincidentally -- Clinton's new enthusiasm for 
foreign affairs has changed the way his Administration does business and should 
improve his chances for further success, aides say. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's increased participation in foreign policy-making "may be the 
most important thing that has changed in the past few months," one senior 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 During his first year in office, Clinton resisted spending time on foreign 
policy and even turned down a plea from Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
to devote one hour a week to an unhurried, non-crisis discussion of 
international affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 But this autumn, the President finally gave in and added a weekly foreign 
policy lunch to his schedule, usually on Thursday or Friday, a senior official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The session normally includes Christopher, Vice President Al Gore, White House 
National Security Adviser Anthony Lake and Defense Secretary William J. Perry, 
with lesser aides occasionally invited. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, officials said, is a policy-making process that is more systematic 
than in the Administration's often-chaotic early days, when Clinton sometimes 
dropped in on discussions late in the day and reopened issues that aides 
believed they had resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, foreign concerns are even following Clinton on the campaign trail. Last 
weekend, when he went to Connecticut and Florida to stump for Democrats running 
for Congress in next month's elections, Lake went along to keep tabs on 
deliberations on Iraq at the United Nations for the President. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lake was in constant touch with his negotiators . . . (and) would brief the 
President between speeches," White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta said. 
</P>
<P>
 And this week, Clinton announced that he will take four days out of his 
campaign schedule to fly to the Middle East for the signing of a peace treaty 
between Israel and Jordan on Wednesday -- an international diversion that this 
President would have found almost unthinkable a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Where Clinton once seemed uncertain of his command of diplomatic and military 
issues, he has visibly gained confidence, and he now hurls himself into the 
details of foreign conflicts with all the zest he once reserved for welfare 
reform and budget projections. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had not spent a lot of time on foreign policy previously as a governor," a 
senior aide noted. "The accumulation of 18 months (of experience) now means 
that he remembers the history of an issue all the more and is getting more and 
more into the details of things." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's new activism has had one more positive effect: It has stopped -- or 
at least slowed -- a growing rift between Christopher's State Department and 
Lake's National Security Council staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher and Lake themselves appear to work well together, but some of 
their aides have indulged in bitter whispering campaigns over which of the two 
is doing the better job on Clinton's behalf -- and which is likely to lose his 
job first. 
</P>
<P>
 So bitter had the backbiting become that Clinton had to issue a blunt order: 
"Cut it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher and Lake warned their aides that further sniping would be 
punished, and they publicly declared their high regard for each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have never been on better terms," Lake said. "Better than . . . any time 
that I can remember," Christopher echoed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tension between the two offices is real, and officials said it 
reflects more than just traditional friction between the State Department and 
the National Security Council staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Underpinning the jockeying is a basic difference in approach toward the rest 
of the world. Lake is an idealistic, liberal internationalist who wants the 
United States to use its power to promote democracy in countries such as Haiti 
and Rwanda. Christopher is a pragmatic, liberal internationalist who worries 
about the risks of overextending U.S. commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't a fundamental conflict," a State Department official said. "But 
there is a difference over how readily you use U.S. military power in areas 
that are not of vital interest." 
</P>
<P>
 In practice, that has meant that Christopher was more reluctant than Lake to 
use military power in Haiti, at least initially, and more insistent in warning 
against using U.S. ground troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 Another, equally important factor is the widespread perception -- fed by leaks 
from the White House -- that Clinton may soon replace Christopher or Lake, or 
both. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a feeling among some staff people that this is a zero-sum game -- 
that if State gets credit for doing something right, it's to the disadvantage 
of NSC, and vice versa," an National Security Council aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff members see their own careers on the line in the contest, the aide 
added: "If your boss goes down, you go down." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior officials said they do not know what Clinton plans beyond a high-level 
review of his appointments after the congressional elections. But the President 
told both Christopher and Lake last month that their jobs are safe for the 
immediate future -- and the recent run of good news on foreign policy seems to 
have reduced pressure for change. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the Administration's improving fortunes overseas did not stop the 
sniping between State and NSC. Instead, the two bureaucracies have been 
competing to see who gets credit for the upturn. 
</P>
<P>
 But that may be a backhanded good sign. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the early months, people were trying to absolve themselves from blame," a 
senior State Department official noted. "Now they're trying to grab credit. At 
least that suggests that things have improved in general." American Forces

NORTH AMERICA; CANADA'S LEADER TAKES AIM AT NATIONAL DEBT; PRIME MINISTER JEAN 
CHRETIEN VOWS TO CUT THE DEFICIT AND TELLS CITIZENS THEY MUST ADJUST TO 
'REALITIES.' THE WELFARE STATE MAY BE TRIMMED, AND TAX HIKES HAVE NOT BEEN 
RULED OUT. 
</P>

<P>
 Nearly a year after taking office and with his popularity at an all-time high, 
Prime Minister Jean Chretien is making his first moves toward attacking 
Canada's mountainous public debt, among the largest in the industrialized 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 In two days of hearings before a parliamentary committee this week, Finance 
Minister Paul Martin set deficit-cutting as the government's top fiscal 
priority. While declining to provide many specifics, Martin called for 
sacrifice across the spectrum of Canadian society, which has developed an 
extensive welfare state over the last 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin said he is determined to reduce the federal budget deficit to 3% of 
gross domestic product within two years "come hell or high water" and set an 
ultimate goal of zero deficit. He refused to rule out tax increases but noted 
that "Canadians believe that they already are taxed to the hilt." 
</P>
<P>
 Chretien followed up with an appearance on "Canada A.M.," a morning television 
news show. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to adjust the system to the realities of today," he told anchorman 
Keith Morrison. "Too many people have become too dependent on government." 
</P>
<P>
 These comments came less than two weeks after Human Resources Minister Lloyd 
Axworthy released a "discussion paper" of proposed reforms for Canada's social 
services, including reduced federal support for welfare, unemployment insurance 
and university education. 
</P>
<P>
 The question now is how -- or whether -- Chretien will follow the rhetoric 
with action. The anti-deficit hard line is a sharp turnaround for his Liberal 
Party. In last year's election 
</P>
<P>
 campaign, which swept them to power and ended the nine-year reign of the 
Progressive Conservatives, the Liberals emphasized job creation, suggesting 
that the economy could grow out of the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 But once in office, Chretien, like President Clinton, found hoped-for programs 
to reshape the national economy and diminish child poverty held hostage by the 
increasing share of federal revenue used to pay interest on the debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada's public debt is about $700 billion, nearly equal to its gross domestic 
product. By contrast, the U.S. debt is about 70% of GDP. 
</P>
<P>
 The most persistent criticism of Chretien in his first year was that he did 
little to tackle the deficit or Canada's other significant problems. 
Nonetheless, the economy has improved, and Chretien's approval ratings in the 
polls are above 60% and rising. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Simpson, a columnist for the Globe & Mail national newspaper and one 
of the country's leading political analysts, believes that Chretien's 
unquestioned integrity and low-key style account for much of his popularity. 
But, Simpson said, the prime minister's unambitious agenda also helped; 
Canadians may have been looking for an interregnum after more than a decade of 
aggressive, often controversial leadership by former prime ministers Brian 
Mulroney and Pierre Elliott Trudeau. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a year now, they're consulting, they're reviewing, they're preparing, 
they're quarter-mastering themselves for the battles to come," Simpson said of 
Chretien's team. "We'll see how many battles they'll actually fight." 
</P>
<P>
 And there figures to be a battle if the government goes ahead with cuts. 
Business leaders, economists and anti-poverty advocates are already raising the 
decibel level over whether the deficit should be closed by tightening programs 
or increasing taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 As the debate plays out, Chretien will have to balance it with his campaign to 
keep Quebec's separatist government from winning a referendum on independence 
in the province some time next year. Serious cutbacks in popular programs will 
be used by the separatists to try to persuade Quebeckers they have little to 
lose by leaving Canada. Climbing Government Debt 
</P>
<P>
 Interest on Canada's federal debt is accumulating at $85,000 per minute, 24 
hours a day. Spending cuts and/or tax increases are the nation's main 
alternatives to promote growth and decrease debt.

DOLE EAGER TO DOWNPLAY GOP'S PERFORMANCE IN CONGRESS; POLITICS: ON THE CAMPAIGN 
TRAIL, MINORITY LEADER AVOIDS REMINDING VOTERS OF THE REPUBLICANS' ANTI-CLINTON 
STRATEGY THAT HELPED PERPETUATE GRIDLOCK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Autumn has been grand for the Grand Old Party. Congressional Republicans have 
largely derailed President Clinton's legislative program and set the stage for 
sweeping election victories that could give the GOP more power than it has had 
in years. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the man who can most claim credit for the Republicans' successful 
stop-Clinton strategy strides to the campaign dais these days, his topic is 
likely to be crime-fighting, tax-cutting, foreign affairs -- usually anything 
but gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking forward," Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) recently 
told a rain-spattered crowd here in the home district of House Minority Whip 
Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.). The next congressional session "is going to move America 
in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 It is no accident that Dole has chosen to downplay the Republicans' 
performance during the last congressional term. The masterful strategy that 
yielded such rich dividends in Congress -- derailing bills ranging from health 
care to campaign finance -- carries formidable risks for the GOP as the party 
heads toward 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the strategy seems to promise a bonanza for Republicans at the ballot 
box on Nov. 8, some analysts say they believe that it could complicate the 
party's broader ambition to retake the White House. In the face of tricky 
challenges from independents as well as Democrats, the Republicans may have a 
hard time distancing themselves from the Washington Establishment they have 
worked so hard to discredit. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the Republicans win the seven seats they need to regain control of the 
Senate, the job of separating themselves from an unpopular Congress -- while 
trying to advance some kind of positive program -- is likely to be even 
tougher. 
</P>
<P>
 And for Dole, the approach that proved so lethal in August and September could 
reinforce his image as a strident naysayer -- and a consummate Washington 
insider -- just as the jostling field of Republican presidential candidates 
begins to position itself for the job he has so long coveted. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the rewards and risks of his strategy were evident as Dole crisscrossed 
the autumn-tinted Eastern Seaboard last week as part of a campaign swing that 
has taken him to more than 30 states since Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican faithful cheered heartily in Georgia, New York, Connecticut and 
Pennsylvania as Dole forecast the party's success in the midterm elections and 
joked about his special status with the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've blamed me for everything but that airplane that crashed into the 
White House," Dole joked in his familiar growl at stop after stop. He got in 
gentle jabs at the competition, wryly observing that former independent 
presidential candidate Ross Perot "thinks a lot," pointedly remarking that 
potential GOP presidential rival Dick Cheney's proposal for preemptive attacks 
on Iraq makes no sense -- "unless you're running for something." 
</P>
<P>
 But lurking ever near were questions about why Congress, Dole's platform and 
preserve for 34 years, seemed to be in such a pathetic state. The question even 
came from the gray-suited participant at an American Bankers Assn. convention 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters want congressional term limits, a drawling Southern banker told Dole, 
because "we want some leaders who will take a chance" and won't take positions 
on issues "just so the other party loses." 
</P>
<P>
 Later the same day when Dole appeared on CNN's "Larry King Live" to talk about 
Clinton's recent moves in the Persian Gulf, a caller from Buffalo, N.Y., 
complained: "It seems you're not willing to agree or work with the President at 
all."  
</P>
<P>
 Said another, from Tulsa, Okla.: "Why can't you phrase your dialogue more 
constructively?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people have short memories," Dole countered, insisting that "we've been 
a big help to President Clinton." 
</P>
<P>
 And that has been Dole's approach. The man who last year said that "a little 
gridlock may be good from time to time" now parries any suggestion that he 
deserves blame -- or credit -- for its fruits. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there is no question that Republican strategy has been more of a winner in 
the short term than many political professionals had expected -- and also more 
of a high point in the soar-and-plummet career of this highly durable 
71-year-old politician. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican and a close Dole ally: "He's 
probably in a stronger position within the party than he's ever been." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole came to prominence as Republican National Committee chairman in 1971, but 
was ousted two years later. He was honored with a vice presidential nomination 
in 1976, only to be blamed when the Gerald R. Ford ticket went down to defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 He survived failed presidential bids in 1980 and 1988, won the Senate majority 
leader's position in 1981 and lost it when Republicans lost the Senate in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 With George Bush's defeat in 1992, Dole became the GOP's titular head, even 
though much of the party's surging right wing considered him too centrist, too 
pragmatic and simply too respected by the Washington Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton years have followed the same trajectory as the rest of his career, 
beginning in deep gloom that gave way to promise. "Two years ago, the Democrats 
had control of the agenda, were eating at the (Ronald) Reagan political base 
and were about to make hay on health care and welfare reform," said Stuart 
Rothenberg, publisher of the Rothenberg Political Report. With Clinton's help, 
"the Republicans turned it all around." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole is personally credited with stopping the Administration's $16-billion 
economic stimulus package in April, 1993, and guiding the overall Republican 
strategy in the health care debate. 
</P>
<P>
 In one example of his skill, he held his fire on the Clinton health care 
proposals for three months -- until January, 1994 -- so the Republican 
leadership would not be accused of premature judgment. When public opinion -- 
prodded along by other critics -- had begun to turn against the Clinton plan, 
Dole was ready to speak out. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnessing Dole's lawmaking skill was "like watching the best pitcher in the 
National League," said Lawrence O'Donnell, chief of staff for the Senate 
Finance Committee, chaired by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.). "It was 
Dole in control." 
</P>
<P>
 The control came in large measure because Republicans used the filibuster 78 
times, in more and different ways than ever. And that fact led to Congress' 
acrimonious meltdown last month, as the session's close smothered legislation 
on the environment, campaign finance, lobbying and telecommunications and 
nearly extinguished a high-priced education bill that had been expected to pass 
easily. 
</P>
<P>
 At the session's end, Clinton urged voters to punish the Republicans for 
holding up solutions to the nation's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But the common political judgment was that, in the short term, there would be 
little penalty for gridlock. That became especially clear when one Democrat, 
Sen. Kent Conrad of North Dakota, began boasting in a campaign ad on television 
last month that "a majority of the time, I voted with the Republican leader, 
Bob Dole." 
</P>
<P>
 In the course of the past congressional session, Dole has gained powerful 
advantages in his quest for the presidency. Although his age is a liability, 
his senior rank has given him huge fund-raising and organizational advantages 
and a leading claim on a party "that is highly hierarchical and tends to give 
the nomination to the next in line," one GOP strategist said. 
</P>
<P>
 But his prominence also has caused him problems with the broader electorate. A 
CBS-New York Times poll, taken last month after the failure of the health care 
bill, showed that Dole's negative rating had bounced to 27%, from 20% a month 
earlier, while his approval rating was barely changed at 24%.

 The unfortunate fact for Dole is that his role in saying no to some of 
Clinton's legislation tends to confirm a general impression that he is a 
negative personality, said Ross K. Baker, a congressional scholar at Rutgers 
University. "It just dovetails all too neatly with this impression of Dole as 
this dark, sardonic presence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And while Dole's opposition role has turned off some parts of the broader 
electorate, it has not convinced all conservatives that he is their man. Many 
remember Dole's earlier declarations that he wanted to find common ground with 
Clinton; they suspect Dole was forced to take a harder line by the right wing 
of the party, including another potential presidential rival, Sen. Phil Gramm 
(R-Tex.). 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't the Bob Dole critique of Bill Clinton, but the Phil Gramm critique, 
that prevailed" in the party, said James Pinkerton, a White House aide in the 
Reagan and Bush administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 These countervailing pressures from the right and center grow inevitably from 
Dole's role as minority leader: The job compels him to take strong positions 
for the growing conservative wing of GOP Senate ranks while not alienating the 
dwindling number of moderates. 
</P>
<P>
 Many observers say they believe that those pressures will be even sharper if 
the Republicans gain control of the Senate. The job would not only impose huge 
demands on his time, but also oblige him to try to pass some kind of 
affirmative program. It also would increase Republican vulnerability to the 
anti-incumbent vote in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Some political professionals say they think that the Republican Party will be 
in much the same touchy spot as Dole in 1996. The unappealing spectacle of this 
year's gridlock might not be long remembered -- until voters start asking why 
there has been little or no progress on the problems they care about. 
</P>
<P>
 The independents -- who according to polls pose a particular risk of draining 
off Republican votes -- are likely to aim their fire at Republicans, according 
to conservative analyst Kevin Phillips. Perot, who ran as a independent 
presidential candidate in 1992, has been calling for voters to throw the 
Democrats out in 1994 -- and dump the Republicans in 1996 if they have not 
performed. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Republicans win the Senate, or even the House, "they'll be on the spot, 
big time" to act, Phillips said. "It could be that people are so unhappy with 
both of them that by early 1996 they are lighting prayer candles for (former 
Joint Chiefs Chairman) Colin Powell and Ross Perot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dole, who has said he will decide whether to run for President between the 
midterm election and January, sounded nonplussed by the prospect that he will 
inherit his second favorite job: majority leader of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll take that chance," he said.

PLOT ALLEGED IN RUSSIAN CORRUPTION SCANDAL; LAWSUIT: DEFENSE MINISTER SUES 
NEWSPAPER AFTER ARTICLES CALL HIM A THIEF. CONTROVERSY ALSO INVOLVES REPORTER'S 
MURDER. 
</P>

<P>
 With his officer's honor besmirched in a ferocious scandal involving murder 
and Mercedes sedans, Russia's defense minister warned Friday of a "monstrous 
political provocation" meant to force him to resign and sow confusion in the 
Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
 "The backstage conductors of this persecution are trying to cause a crisis of 
power," Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev declared in an official statement. 
"Playing the 'army card' time after time, they are pushing society to the 
dangerous edge of complete chaos and disorder." 
</P>
<P>
 Grachev, a normally mild-mannered former paratroop leader who has kept the 
Russian army relatively calm as it suffered through massive post-Cold War cuts, 
was trying to fend off a rash of accusations that he and some of his top brass 
are corrupt. 
</P>
<P>
 He brought suit Friday against the Moskovsky Komsomolets daily, which had 
published a full-page story the day before using Grachev's nickname, "Pasha 
Mercedes," a reference to the Mercedes-Benz sedans that he allegedly obtained 
through the retreating Russian forces in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "A thief should be in prison and not be defense minister," the headline read. 
</P>
<P>
 Moskovsky Komsomolets, always sensational, abandoned all caution in the wake 
of the murder Wednesday of its investigative reporter, Dmitri Kholodov. 
Kholodov, who specialized in uncovering corruption in the military, was killed 
in his office when a briefcase that was supposed to have contained 
incriminating documents on the Russian contingent in Germany blew up as he 
opened it. 
</P>
<P>
 The daily newspaper published documents on two $100,000 Mercedes-Benz 
automobiles that it alleged had been bought for Grachev's personal use out of 
funds meant for the resettlement of Russian officers returning from Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 It also referred to the plentiful supplies of Russian guns, uniforms and 
ammunition available in Germany that could only have become available for sale 
through corrupt officers. Kholodov had been working on proving that Russian 
weaponry had been sold under the table. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Moskovsky Komsomolets went even further, accusing the head of 
the Western Group of Forces, Gen. Matvei Burlakov, of "knowing arithmetic -- 
how to extract money from the budget, fold it in his pocket, share it with his 
bosses and multiply stars" on his uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 Grachev said he had asked Russia's chief prosecutor to bring criminal charges 
against "the slanderers" and accused the newspaper of waging an anti-military 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have said it before and repeat it again: We, the military, want only one 
thing -- stability and civic consensus in society," his statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 Libel and slander suits have become ever more popular weapons in Russia's 
political battles. Last month, ultranationalist lawmaker Vladimir V. 
Zhirinovsky won a libel suit against Yegor T. Gaidar, the architect of 
Yeltsin's free-market economic reforms. And a leader of the Old Guard 
Parliament won a libel case against President Boris N. Yeltsin, who described 
him as a fascist in a recent book. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mercedes-Benz scandal dealt a heavy blow to the prestige of the army, 
which remains one of the most trusted institutions in Russian society, despite 
its decline since its Soviet heyday. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to concern about the scandal's repercussions was a poll in Friday's 
Izvestia newspaper depicting a longstanding volatile mood among Russian 
officers. The joint Russian-German survey of 615 of the army's elite officers 
found that 50% of generals believed a shift to "some kind of dictatorship" was 
inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Sporadic scares about an impending military coup have largely ceased here, but 
the level of military discontent remains high. More than 50% of the officers 
interviewed said they had no confidence in Grachev, Izvestia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Calls for Grachev's resignation also came from Russian liberals. One of 
Yeltsin's main backers, the party known as Russia's Democratic Choice, issued a 
statement saying the military leadership had compromised itself and proven 
incapable of reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Grachev left Moscow on Thursday on a trip to the Russian Far East, but he is 
expected to face the political firing line next week: He has been summoned to 
the Duma, the lower house of Parliament, to discuss the state of the army. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Russian political news Friday, Yeltsin announced that a summit of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States had failed to bring agreement on creating a 
body that would bind the former Soviet republics more closely together. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev had proposed the creation of a 
Eurasian Union -- along the lines of the European Union -- but seven decades of 
forced Soviet togetherness apparently left the former republics too skittish to 
accept such a grouping.

MRES FALLING HARDEST IN NEW HAITI; CARIBBEAN: MORALLY REPUGNANT ELITE ARE 
PAYING FOR THEIR LOYALTY TO DEPOSED REGIME WITH MONEY, HOMES AND FREEDOM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 It's been quite a fall for Romeo Halloun. Gone are the Uzi submachine guns, 
the baskets of no-questions-asked money, the $60,000 cars and the swagger that 
comes with being the biggest thug on the block. 
</P>
<P>
 Halloun, a 30ish son of a wealthy trader in smuggled goods, sits in a U.S. 
Army detention cell here, representative of a short-lived class of Haitians 
notable for their audacity and, in the minds of many people, their stupidity. 
</P>
<P>
 They were a group of mostly young Haitians who, not content to merely enjoy 
the money their families had made over the years in their largely illicit 
businesses, had attached themselves to the Haitian military after the 
September, 1991, coup that overthrew populist President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 They had money, sometimes millions of dollars. They had guns and drugs, they 
had fancy cars and big homes, and the power that came with being the favorites 
of the most brutal and corrupt military in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 They were members of what American diplomats and journalists called the 
Morally Repugnant Elite, or MREs -- a group previously reserved for Haiti's old 
and rich business sector. 
</P>
<P>
 What they did not seem to have was the common sense to realize that they had 
hitched themselves to a star that would flame out in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 Their time was up on Sept. 19, when the first of nearly 20,000 U.S. troops 
landed here and put an end to the reign of the killers and looters who passed 
themselves off as Haiti's army. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the first to fall was Halloun, who was arrested when he and a cousin, 
Patrick Mourra, tried to pass through an American Army roadblock. The U.S. 
troops arrested Halloun and Mourra after realizing that they were listed as 
possible criminal suspects both in Haiti and the United States and after 
finding several automatic weapons in their car. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of dozen other MREs today share the detention facilities with Halloun 
and Mourra, waiting to see if they will be sent to the United States for 
prosecution or held until the Haitian judicial system is rebuilt and they can 
be tried here. 
</P>
<P>
 Others have followed the lead of their masters -- former army commander in 
chief Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, chief of staff Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby and 
Port-au-Prince Police Chief Michel-Joseph Francois -- and fled the country. 
</P>
<P>
 But most have stayed, some even hoping that last week's restoration of 
Aristide is a passing inconvenience. Others protest their innocence or have 
turned informer, while still others have fallen into despair and bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 One close associate of Francois who had abandoned his respected profession as 
an engineer to advise the police chief on his business dealings has seen his 
life collapse. Work on a multimillion-dollar home has been abandoned, and his 
daughter had to give up hope of attending a university in Paris and settle for 
a much more modest school in Martinique. 
</P>
<P>
 This man, who customarily wore a different silk shirt every day and seemed to 
have gold watches and bracelets to match every shirt, has been reduced to 
soliciting journalists to rent one of his three luxury cars to provide some 
ready cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Another young man, also in his early 30s and a graduate of Columbia University 
in New York, saw Biamby as his hope for wealth and power. Using his 
connections, he made a fast fortune in smuggled cars, French perfume and other 
embargo-breaking goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days after the U.S. troops landed, his business was bare, the three 
automatic rifles in his closet were confiscated, and his cocaine dealer was 
looking for him. 
</P>
<P>
 This man and most of the others seemed to believe that their distorted 
existence would go on and on. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just spent and spent," said an American businessman who had to do 
business with some of the new MREs to export his products. "What they got, they 
spent. If it was a hundred-dollar bribe, that bought them a dinner at Cafe des 
Arts (a favorite of the MREs and Cedras). If it was a million dollars on a 
cement deal, that bought a new house." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the money, the young Haitian man has lost the right to swagger. 
He has had to bury the automatic assault rifle given to him by Francois. 
</P>
<P>
 He and many of his fellow MREs live in constant terror of retribution from the 
ordinary Haitians who suffered under the military regime. He watches fearfully 
whenever a car approaches his home. His apprehension grows if he sees a group 
of ordinary Haitians walking on his road. 
</P>
<P>
 "He sees dechoukaj all around," said a friend, using the Creole word for 
uprooting that connotes utter devastation. "He is afraid he'll lose 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dunes Casino, a tacky gambling house that tolerated open cocaine use and 
no-limit blackjack games, now refuses to give him and his fellow MREs credit 
and has posted a sign saying no one carrying a gun will be admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurant owners who once catered to their tastes in food and wine now ignore 
them or turn them away for not having reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 How could these people have misjudged so badly? 
</P>
<P>
 "They were blinded by the money, the power," an associate of one said. "And 
their hatred of Aristide was so strong they couldn't believe anyone would help 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "But in the long run, whatever intelligence they had was overrun by greed, 
it's that simple."

3RD TIME NO CHARM AS 'CHUNNEL' TRAIN BREAKS DOWN AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A high-speed train carrying railroad executives through the Channel Tunnel 
broke down Friday, the third such embarrassment in just over a week as 
officials prepare to begin regular passenger service. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eurostar train, heading from London to Paris, had just made it through the 
"Chunnel" when it broke down, said Eurotunnel spokeswoman Allyson Andrews. 
</P>
<P>
 The passengers -- among them Eurotunnel's British co-chairman, Alastair 
Morton, and Bob Reid, chairman of British Rail -- were stranded for about 2 1/2 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a breakdown due to a mechanical teething problem, and they were 
astonishingly efficient in bringing up a reserve train to Calais," Morton said. 
"We had no other problems for the rest of the journey." 
</P>
<P>
 The breakdown came a day after Eurostar had to call in a replacement train to 
take a group of journalists from London to Paris. On Oct. 14, a train from 
Paris to London died on the tracks in southeast England, snarling traffic on 
parts of the British Rail system for up to two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The trains operated by the national railroads of Britain, France and Belgium 
are scheduled to open to the public on Nov. 14.

BRAZIL ACTS TO SLOW ECONOMIC EXPANSION; LATIN AMERICA: TIGHTER CREDIT, TAXES ON 
FOREIGN INVESTMENT AIM TO FIGHT INFLATION. LESS-AFFLUENT CONSUMERS ARE AFFECTED 
.  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scrambling to keep its anti-inflation program on track, the Brazilian 
government Friday tightened credit to industry and consumers to rein in a 
rapidly expanding economy and imposed new taxes on foreign investment to keep 
increases in the monetary supply at bay. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a disheartening blow to the nation's lower- and lower-middle-income 
consumers, who under extended payment plans enacted in the last three months 
had suddenly been able to afford products that were beyond their grasp during 
more than a decade of high inflation, when long-term credit was nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was planning to buy a new refrigerator today," said Gilberto Moraes, 31, a 
sanitation worker. "Until yesterday, I could pay for it over 12 months, but now 
that I have to pay in three months, I can't afford it." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the country's economic plan went into effect in July, inflation dropped 
from 50% a month to less than 1% in September, its lowest level in 20 years. 
The newfound stability released a torrent of spending. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what the government is trying to stop," said Wayne Perkins, a vice 
president at Banco NorChem, which is managed by Chemical Banking Corp. of New 
York. "It could drive inflation right back up." 
</P>
<P>
 Auto sales have jumped as much as 15% since July, and production of major 
appliances, such as washers, dryers, refrigerators and some electronic 
equipment is sold out through January, analysts report. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been crazy," said Ike Rahmani, managing director of Banco Tendencia in 
Sao Paulo. "I think the government may have gone a little far, but they had to 
act now because we are approaching the end of the year. That's when consumption 
could really take off." 
</P>
<P>
 In November or December, nearly all Brazilian workers receive a bonus 
equivalent to one month's salary. 
</P>
<P>
 To limit consumer spending, the government imposed credit restrictions that 
cut terms for auto loans from 36 months to 12 months and loans for many other 
products from 12 months to three. It eliminated credit altogether for certain 
items. And credit cards must now be paid in full each month. 
</P>
<P>
 The government also implemented a 1% tax on foreign investment in the stock 
market and increased the tax from 5% to 9% on foreign investment in bond funds 
in order to slow growth in its money supply, a key factor in the success of its 
economic plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's year-end target for currency in circulation of 10.2 billion 
reals ($12 billion) has already been surpassed by 2.8 billion reals. Record 
imports and a recent surge in foreign investment contributed to the increase in 
circulating currency, because the government is forced to print reals to redeem 
the foreign currency. 
</P>
<P>
 Also contributing to the currency increase was the purchase this month by the 
nation's Central Bank of an estimated $1 billion to prop up the dollar, which 
has been falling steadily since July against Brazil's real. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the increase in taxes on foreign bond investment was largely 
symbolic, because the amount of money in that market is relatively small. The 
new tax on stock transactions, however, could send a negative signal to foreign 
investors, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult to say what the effect will be," Perkins said. "One percent is 
actually small, but it could make some people nervous, because this is a 
precedent in that the Brazilian government has never taxed foreign investment 
in equities." 
</P>
<P>
 The market will slow some, Rahmani said, "but my personal view is that the 
worst has already happened. . . . I think as (President-elect) Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso starts naming his Cabinet, things will begin to pick up." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts largely praised the government for taking quick steps to keep the 
nation's economy on stable footing. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the most important thing," Perkins said, "that they keep the economy 
stable over a long term. They have done a very creditable job so far in 
managing the (economic) plan."

CHRISTOPHER'S TRAVEL PLANS FOUND STREWN ON N.Y. RUNWAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A computer bag containing documents related to Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher's travel plans fell off a transfer vehicle at New York's John F. 
Kennedy Airport, and the papers were found blowing across the runway, the State 
Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy spokeswoman Christine Shelly insisted the bag "contained no classified 
material," although she acknowledged that the department generally does not 
publicize Christopher's travel arrangements for security reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher is due to visit the Middle East next week, making some stops with 
President Clinton and some on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 The bag belonged to an aide in his office who was leaving to do advance work 
in the region in preparation for the trip. The department's diplomatic security 
field office in New York was notified Thursday that the bag, which had been 
checked as baggage for the aide's flight, had been discovered at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Newspapers in New York reported that the bag was discovered Wednesday evening 
after a pilot reported debris blocking the airport runway. The newspapers said 
documents blowing across the tarmac included notes on Christopher's travel 
schedule in the Middle East and what he likes to eat for breakfast.

UNMET EXPECTATIONS TROUBLE GAZA; MIDEAST: FIVE MONTHS AFTER TAKING OVER, 
PALESTINIAN LEADERS WORRY THAT DISCONTENT COULD TURN INTO ANGRY UNREST. 
</P>

 As cars and trucks honked their way past his curbside grill, Ahmed abu Fajr 
quickly fashioned ground lamb and traditional Arab spices into kebabs, but he 
minced no words as he assessed the new Palestinian Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have begun -- and nothing more," said Abu Fajr, 41. "We have this 
autonomy, this self-government, but we do not know what we can do with it. So 
far, there's nothing to be satisfied with, nothing to be proud of." 
</P>
<P>
 Customers perched on stools around low wooden tables in the sidewalk cafe 
agreed, and Abu Fajr's mild criticism of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's 
administration here soon grew into a veritable roar of condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jobs -- where are the jobs he promised?" demanded Ahmed Mutawi, 48, a small, 
wiry electrician who has not worked regularly in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Housing is the key," Ibrahim Hijawi, 33, a German-trained mechanical 
engineer, replied, "but what is being done about housing? Very, very little." 
</P>
<P>
 "Have the Israelis gone? Not really," added Moustafa Hindi, 37, owner of a 
neighboring fabric shop. "The settlers are still here, the army is still here 
to guard them, and so there are still clashes and still casualties. And 
whenever Israel wants, it locks us all up in Gaza -- like a big prison." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, tensions ran high as Israel this week sealed off the Gaza Strip, along 
with the West Bank, after a bomb -- for which the militant Palestinian group 
Hamas claimed responsibility -- ripped apart a bus in Tel Aviv and killed 22 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 And after just five months of Palestinian administration, discontent is 
welling throughout the Gaza Strip. Palestinian leaders from Arafat down 
acknowledge their fears that it could turn into angry unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an unemployment rate of 58% that we can count and probably more," 
Arafat told visitors to his seaside office recently. "More than 80% of our 
people live below the poverty line by any measure. That means in the morning 
they probably don't know how they are going to eat that evening. And they 
expect so much from us -- they expect everything -- and there is so little we 
can give them so far." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfulfilled expectations after a period of great euphoria seriously worry 
Arafat's ministers. 
</P>
<P>
 "When empty stomachs rumble, they really growl," said Freih abu Medeen, the 
Palestinian Authority's justice minister. "Street talk is cheap, but hungry and 
unemployed people are a grave concern for us." 
</P>
<P>
 For Arafat, the key is Western assistance to get the Palestinian Authority up 
and running and foreign investment to build an economy for Gaza's 850,000 
people. That aid -- more than $2.5 billion was promised -- has been slow in 
coming as Palestinians have sought to meet donors' requirements for project 
planning and financial accountability. 
</P>
<P>
 One job creation scheme has put 350 unemployed Gazans to work cleaning up Gaza 
City, and the authority is hoping for international assistance to increase the 
number of people employed to at least 10,000 and expand it throughout the Gaza 
Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 But such make-work projects do not seem to encourage many. "Cleaning up Gaza 
is good -- the place is like a huge refuse dump," Abu Fajr said, fanning his 
kebabs, "but this is not developing a real economy. And, even if they do take 
on 10,000 people, what of the rest of the 120,000 who used to work in Israel? 
And how long will this work last -- six months?" 
</P>
<P>
 While Palestinians are known for their political pessimism, the groundswell of 
criticism is turning into anger in Gaza's ramshackle and crumbling towns, in 
its squalid refugee camps and even in the offices of Fatah, the principal group 
within the Palestine Liberation Organization and Arafat's power base. 
</P>
<P>
 "Abu Ammar (Arafat) is not doing anything to persuade the people that he 
understands their problems and is working on them," complained Tawfik abu 
Khousa, a leader of the Fatah Hawks during the intifada , the rebellion against 
the Israeli occupation. "The Palestinian Authority has little contact with the 
people. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "There was a general consensus, which included even the PLO's opponents, to 
give the authority a chance," Khousa said. "Well, that time is running out. The 
Palestinian Authority needs to demonstrate that it is a government of, by and 
for the people by taking up their concerns. Otherwise, not only will it lose 
the elections when they are held, but lose control of the whole situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of the grumbling, although now the most notable feature of politics 
in the Gaza Strip, is hard to assess because the PLO's rivals among Islamic 
militants do not yet pose a credible challenge, and Fatah remains confident 
that it will be able to form a "national unity" coalition that will win the 
elections expected by spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our fear, if we fail to relieve the poverty and realize people's hopes, is 
that extremists will appear, that they will become leaders of the street and 
that they plunge us into internal conflict and even greater despair than we 
have known," Medeen said. "Although the majority of the people support the 
Palestinian Authority, we are young, and we are weak, and we are vulnerable, 
very vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
 Most Palestinians do acknowledge the vastness of Gaza's problems after 27 
years of Israeli occupation, but many also criticize the PLO and the officials 
Arafat has appointed for failing to work harder and more imaginatively in 
solving those problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have failed so far to operate effectively any of the government 
departments," declared Mansour Shawa, a leading Palestinian businessman, "and 
that lack of proper performance has discouraged the donor countries without 
whose aid we cannot begin to solve Gaza's problems. . . . We are squandering 
the opportunity for which our people have struggled and fought for so long. 
Unless Mr. Arafat appoints new and competent people, we are heading for a 
national calamity." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics indeed view the Palestinian Authority under Arafat as an unfolding 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Palestinians have become the administrators of their own occupation," said 
Dr. Mahmoud Zahhar, a leader of the Muslim fundamentalist movement Hamas, which 
opposed the peace agreement between the PLO and Israel. "The Israelis lay down 
the rules, and Arafat enforces them. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you think that Israel will ever accept a strong and independent 
Palestinian state growing next to it? Clearly not. So autonomy is a charade, a 
self-deception, and in that people will be crushed when they try to use these 
powers we are supposed to have been given." 
</P>
<P>
 But criticism also comes from strong backers of the peace agreement and 
supporters of Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Power should not be an end in itself," said bookshop owner Yusri Fares, 33, a 
Fatah organizer, "but that is what seems to be happening with these people who 
came back from exile with Arafat. They fought for power for so long they failed 
to understand that it is to be used to achieve things. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fatah people come to me and ask when things are going to change," Fares said. 
"They complain they see little improvement in their families' lives. That may 
be unfair, but people measure politics in terms of jobs, of housing, of 
services, of business." 
</P>
<P>
 But with the departure of Israeli troops from all but the settlement areas, 
and the absence of the street patrols, the removal of the checkpoints and 
watchtowers and the ending of the nightly curfew, Gaza is undeniably more 
peaceful and relaxed, if not yet more prosperous. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you consider that our children are not being shot in the streets, when 
you consider that the years of occupation are over, then you appreciate the 
gains we have made," argued Gaza City Mayor Aown Shawa, a cousin of Mansour 
Shawa. "People now have a peace of mind that they have not had for 27 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Riyad Zaanoun, the Palestinian health minister, said Gazans appreciate that 
the most dire predictions -- a civil war between the PLO and its opponents and 
the collapse of the region's health services -- were not realized, and, as a 
result, they give the new government more credit than it seems from current 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "We established security in the first month despite Israeli speculation we 
would be fighting in the streets," Zaanoun said. "Secondly, we maintained and 
have now expanded the health services. Israelis said it would collapse. The 
same is true with education. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Establishing an effective Palestinian government is not going to be done in 
two or three months -- it will take years. Nor are we going to move from 
poverty to prosperity overnight. I think our people are showing a lot of 
tolerance and understanding." 
</P>
<P>
 Recent opinion surveys of Gaza residents show 54% to 60% of those polled 
support the peace agreement and the limited self-government it gave the 
Palestinians; opposition is less than half that, with the balance undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 But impatience is increasing, according to the surveys, with more than half 
criticizing the Palestinian Authority, largely for slowness in economic 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are donors, there are investors, there are businessmen ready to move 
into Gaza," Mansour Shawa said. "They want to see plans, and there are none -- 
at least not with the Palestinian Authority and the people Mr. Arafat has 
appointed, most of whom are unqualified for their posts. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Arafat instead is alienating people, good people. He still operates as if 
he is commanding an army and leading a revolution when he should be founding a 
state and heading a government. . . . This is what brings about the loss of 
hope and the fear for our future." 
</P>
<P>
 Aown Shawa, Mansour's cousin, counseled patience. Permits for about 30 
buildings have been issued in Gaza City, he said, and construction will begin 
within two months. Palestinian investors from abroad are beginning to bring 
projects to him for approval. And foreign assistance is beginning to flow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Capital attracts capital," Aown Shawa said. "It's not fair to expect paradise 
in two or three months -- we need at least a year. Seriously, the PLO is 
learning that it was easier to run a revolution than a state, and our people 
have to understand that throwing stones in the intifada was easier than laying 
bricks for a new economy will be."

MEDICINES MAILED IN SESAME STREET-DECORATED ENVELOPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is investigating the mailing of 
over-the-counter drug samples in envelopes designed with Sesame Street 
characters, following complaints from parents.  
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely plan on looking into this," Michael Bogumill, a compliance 
officer with the commission, said Friday. "Even if it's not illegal, it's 
stupid for people to send adult medicine in a package that's designed for 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 5 million envelopes, of which 2 million contained a sample of Tavist 
D cold medication, were mailed in September and October in 13 states throughout 
the Midwest and California by Madison Direct Marketing, a Connecticut-based 
marketing firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the Children's Television Workshop, which produces Sesame 
Street, said they have been getting complaints from the Boston, Cincinnati and 
Los Angeles areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did approve the Sesame Street materials, but at no time were we aware 
product samples would be included," said Ellen Morgenstern, a spokeswoman for 
the Children's Television Workshop. "We strongly encourage any parents who 
receive a mailing featuring Sesame Street characters on the envelope to keep 
these materials away from young children." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp., the New Jersey-based producers of 
Tavist D, said they also had no idea their product would be put in an envelope 
featuring Sesame Street characters. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoz officials said they followed non-prescription drug industry standards 
for encasing the samples in child-proof containers and have not received any 
reports of children opening the packets, said spokesman Bill O'Donnell. 
</P>
<P>
 "The medication is encased in a blister pack which is then sealed in a foil 
packet that is specifically designed to make it more difficult for children to 
open," O'Donnell said. But, he said, "We are taking our own responsibility for 
ensuring this response never arises again. If we ever do this again, Sandoz 
will make sure that the outside packaging is appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Kimber Fovell of Corona, who received the mailing Thursday, said she will 
always remember seeing her 3-year-old son trying to open the drug sample. 
</P>
<P>
 "The packaging looked like it was for children," Fovell said. "He's always 
been allowed to open mail with characters on it, so I told him to open it in 
his room. A few minutes later, he comes out and says, 'Mommy, can you help me 
open this?' It was a package of Tavist D. He had full access to his blunt 
scissors and he could have opened it up himself. I was terrified. If he hadn't 
brought it to me, he could have easily opened it up and ingested it." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Madison Direct Marketing said this is the first time in their 
11-year history that something like this has happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just trying to deliver the market," said Bruce Gold, executive vice 
president of the firm. "With the benefit of hindsight, there is a concern 
whether we present it in this way again."

 Three members of the Abu Nidal organization, described by the State Department 
as the world's most dangerous terrorist group, were sentenced in St. Louis to 
21 months in prison for plotting terrorist acts.The case was the first 
indication that a cell was operating in the country. Tawfiq Musa, 45, of 
Milwaukee, and brothers Saif Nijmeh, 35, of the St. Louis suburb of Bridgeton, 
and Luie Nijmeh, 30, of Dayton, Ohio, pleaded guilty in July to racketeering 
charges. The defendants and a fourth man were indicted on charges they plotted 
to kill Jews and blow up the Israeli Embassy in Washington.

 A man who warned a group of friends that he would shoot the next person who 
talked shot a 14-year-old girl to death when she spoke, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nina Scott was shot in the forehead as she and her friends sat on her 
grandmother's porch.Kevin Barnes, 18, of Lonoke was charged with first-degree 
murder Wednesday and is being held on $100,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was totally senseless. It was horseplay," said Police Chief Floyd Van 
Horne. "There was no physical altercation, no verbal argument. You had six 
young people sitting on a porch talking." 
</P>
<P>
 Tina Coleman, Nina's aunt, said the other friends told her that Barnes pulled 
the gun on two of them and then issued his warning. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said: 'I'm going to shoot whoever says the next word.' That was Nina," 
Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim's grandmother, Lillie Belle Dodson, said she was inside the house 
when the shooting occurred Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I jumped up and went to see what had happened. Nina had been shot. She was 
lying over there and the porch was full of blood." Dodson said.

Burns campaigned for a second term in the Senate. Burns has come under fire

DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMEN OUTSPEND FOES; POLITICS: MARGIN IS LESS THAN IN PREVIOUS 
YEARS. AND MANY INCUMBENTS DO NOT HAVE AN OVERWHELMING CASH EDGE AS FINAL WEEKS 
OF THE CAMPAIGN BEGIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Vulnerable Democratic incumbents have outspent their challengers in 
congressional races across the country, but by less than in previous years, and 
many do not enjoy an overwhelming cash advantage as they enter the final weeks 
of the campaign, a Times analysis indicates. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic strategists have been hoping -- and Republicans have been fearing 
-- that incumbents could mount a heavy, last-minute spending blitz to knock 
down potential Republican challengers, despite polls showing the election 
tilting strongly toward the GOP. But campaign finance reports filed with the 
Federal Election Commission this week and analyzed by The Times cast doubt on 
that strategy in many competitive districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Through Sept. 30, Democratic incumbents had outspent their Republican 
challengers but in most races the advantage is not huge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times analyzed FEC reports from 74 candidates in highly competitive races 
-- involving 25 seats held by Democrats and 12 held by Republicans. The 
analysis indicates that, while some Democratic incumbents have an apparently 
insurmountable money advantage, others are in far more vulnerable positions. 
The races were among those considered most competitive by strategists from both 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
 To take control of the House, the Republicans must win 40 seats more than they 
have now. They would need to win almost all of the seats they now hold, take 
the vast majority of the 31 seats in which Democratic members of Congress have 
decided not to run and knock off a number of Democratic incumbents as well. 
Republicans have targeted several dozen Democratic incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
 In the races analyzed, Democratic incumbents had spent an average of $492,519 
from January, 1993, through the end of September, while their GOP challengers 
had spent $348,173. In eight races, the Republican challenger had outspent the 
incumbent -- the most striking example being that of Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson 
(D-Woodland Hills), who has been outspent by more than a 3-1 margin by GOP 
opponent Rich Sybert. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, the Democrats entered the stretch run with a substantial 
advantage in cash on hand -- an average of $211,032 remaining versus $122,883 
for challengers. But in only a handful of these competitive races are the 
incumbents clearly in a position to outgun their challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 The analysis looked only at spending by the candidates and could not evaluate 
another potential factor -- independent expenditures by groups seeking to 
influence the races. In some races, that spending can be considerable. Most 
large outside spending campaigns this year are being conducted by conservative 
groups, such as the National Rifle Assn. or backers of term limits and are 
aimed at defeating Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans have considerably fewer vulnerable seats to defend and their 
incumbents have a noticeably larger financial edge over their challengers than 
do Democratic incumbents. On average, Republican incumbents have spent nearly 
60% more than their challengers, although even that sum is less than the 
roughly 2-1 advantage that incumbents have enjoyed in past elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Money, of course, does not mean everything in politics. But it is a powerfully 
important factor, particularly for challengers who usually must build name 
recognition and persuade voters that they are credible alternatives to 
incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
 The most ready sources of funds are interest groups that contribute to 
congressional campaigns in hopes of improving their access to the policy 
debate. Those groups prefer to give their money to incumbents rather than 
taking chances on unknown challengers. For instance, although many business 
groups tend to ally with Republicans ideologically, they often give money to 
the Democrats who control Congress and who therefore control the committees and 
subcommittees in which crucial legislative decisions are made. 
</P>
<P>
 For those reasons, incumbents generally have been able to vastly outspend 
their opponents -- a chief reason why -- despite several years of 
anti-incumbent sentiment -- most incumbents are likely to win reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich 
(R-Ga.) have met several times with representatives of leading political action 
committees to press them to contribute more to GOP candidates this year, 
leading to complaints of heavy-handedness -- against Gingrich, in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 At least through the end of September, the period covered by the FEC reports, 
however, that effort did not appear to have paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 The 25 Democratic incumbents whose reports were analyzed collected an average 
of $325,060 from PACs. Their Republican opponents had collected an average of 
$55,806. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican incumbents did not fare as well with PACs. The 12 Republican 
lawmakers collected an average of $134,551 from PACs. Democratic chalengers had 
collected an average of $86,021. 
</P>
<P>
 The analysis also found that most Democratic incumbents who have been outspent 
are in much better shape for the final stretch because they have stockpiled 
considerably more money than their opponents. But Beilenson, whose district 
covers the northwestern part of the San Fernando Valley and part of Ventura 
County, is a notable exception. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson had spent only $184,680 through Sept. 30. His opponent Sybert had 
spent $601,141. Considered the most vulnerable Democratic incumbent in 
California this year, Beilenson is also one of the few incumbents who refuses 
to take money from PACs, a move that severely limits his fund raising. Going 
into the final weeks, he and Sybert had roughly equal amounts of cash on hand 
-- just over $200,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Democratic incumbents who have been outspent so far include Reps. George 
(Buddy) Darden and Don Johnson in Georgia, Neal Smith in Iowa, Ted Strickland 
in Ohio, Karen Shepherd in Utah, Leslie L. Byrne in Virginia and Jay Inslee in 
Washington. All are considered highly vulnerable, although Darden has a war 
chest for the final weeks that is $250,250 more than his opponent's. Smith and 
Shepherd also have money advantages of more than $100,000 over their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other extreme is the case of Connecticut Rep. Sam Gejdenson, another of 
the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents. Gejdenson led his party's efforts on 
campaign finance reform this year but that does not appear to have slowed his 
fund-raising efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Through September, he had raised more than $1 million, including $363,313 from 
PACs, and had outspent his opponent, Edward W. Munster, by a margin of more 
than 4 to 1. Munster had raised only $265,601 and has hoarded much of that for 
the final few weeks of the campaign, hoping to match Gejdenson's spending for 
the last weeks of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming in right behind Gejdenson in terms of outspending opponents is another 
vulnerable California Democrat, Rep. Richard H. Lehman (D-North Fork). Lehman 
had spent $720,581, compared to only $154,348 by his Republican opponent, 
George P. Radanovich, in the district that covers much of the Central Valley.

CLINTON TO SIGN SCHOOL GUN CURB IN CALIF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton will visit a troubled Bay Area high school today to 
dramatize his tough stance on school violence by signing an order that requires 
a cut-off of federal school aid to districts that do not expel gun-carrying 
pupils. 
</P>
<P>
 A $12.7-billion federal education aid bill signed Thursday by Clinton orders 
states to require expulsions of gun-carrying students. But the law specifies no 
penalty for districts that fail to carry out those policies and Clinton 
Administration officials fear that, without specific sanctions, some school 
districts may drag their feet in complying. 
</P>
<P>
 The signing will come in a one-day swing that is Clinton's first visit to 
California in five months and that will bring him together with his party's 
most visible -- and embattled -- California candidates, Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
and gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown. Clinton will appear with Feinstein 
at Carlmont High School in Belmont and later is to attend an evening 
fund-raiser for Brown in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The school-violence directive continues a recent series of campaign-season 
events in which Clinton has tried to emphasize his concern about education and 
crime -- two issues that the polls show are now foremost on voters' minds. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton talked Monday to a police chiefs convention on youth crime and three 
days later signed the schools bill in a ceremony in Framingham, Mass., with 
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.). 
</P>
<P>
 Carlmont High was chosen for today's event because it plays to what is 
considered to be one of Feinstein's stronger issues. She was co-sponsor of the 
law requiring expulsion of pupils who bring firearms to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein sought to add language to the bill that explicitly would have cut 
off federal aid to districts that failed to comply. The clause was cut out as 
House-Senate conferees reconciled differing versions of the legislation, but 
its removal did not mean that the government was barred from imposing the 
sanctions administratively through the Department of Education, as Clinton's 
order will do. 
</P>
<P>
 Many districts are moving toward stiffer penalties for students who bring guns 
to classes. But only California and Michigan so far have the blanket expulsion 
rules, called "zero tolerance" policies, according to the Children's Defense 
Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 About one in 20 high school students carries a gun to school, according to a 
1990 survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And Clinton is 
expected to point out in his remarks today that two children are killed with 
guns in California every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The single most important thing we can do to improve education for everyone 
in this country is to make schools safe," according to a draft of Clinton's 
prepared remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's appearance will put him in the midst of a cross-fire, which began 
before he had even left Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Mike Huffington (R-Santa Barbara), who as Feinstein's opponent has played 
up her ties to Clinton, sought to turn the tables on the visit. "I sent him a 
free ticket to come out to California," Huffington said in an interview. "He 
wants to keep Feinstein in office so that, when he wants to raise taxes again 
or have a government controlled health care plan, he has somebody to support 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Feinstein insisted that she does not believe Clinton's 
popularity has declined in California. "And I'm really very proud he is going 
to sign this executive order tomorrow and I'm proud to be with him when he does 
it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent Los Angeles Times Poll showed that Clinton's approval rating had 
risen to 49% in California, making the electorally crucial state one in which 
his support is strongest.

WILDER ENDORSES ROBB AGAINST NORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Gov. L. Douglas Wilder endorsed longtime political rival Sen. Charles 
S. Robb on Friday in a show of Democratic unity aimed at helping Robb in his 
tight reelection battle against Republican Oliver L. North. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that we should all be involved in a monumental effort -- one that 
will not rest until the last vote is counted -- to elect Chuck Robb to the 
Senate," Wilder said at a fund-raiser that included an appearance by President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Robb and Clinton denied a report in Thursday's editions of the Washington 
Times that Wilder and Clinton discussed an ambassadorial appointment at the 
meeting if Wilder aided Robb's reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 "That just did not happen," Clinton said during a news conference earlier in 
the day.

WIFE OF CIA DOUBLE AGENT SENTENCED TO 5 YEARS IN PRISON; ESPIONAGE: ROSARIO 
AMES ASKS FOR LENIENCY, PORTRAYING HERSELF AS A VICTIM. BUT PROSECUTORS CALL 
HER A 'GREEDY SPOUSE' WHO AIDED HER HUSBAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rejecting her plea for leniency, a federal judge Friday sentenced a tearful 
Rosario Ames to five years, three months in prison for conspiring to commit 
espionage and evading taxes on $2.5 million in spy payments earned by her 
husband, former CIA agent Aldrich H. Ames. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to a packed courtroom in a halting voice choked with emotion, Mrs. 
Ames told U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton: "I offer you no excuses for my 
conduct -- only explanations." 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in green fatigues with "Alexandria Jail" stenciled in white, she 
insisted that she had been manipulated by her husband and kept in the dark 
about details of his spying for the Soviet Union and later Russia over eight 
years. She said she only learned of his activities by accident in 1992, 
although she acknowledged providing some "advice and support." 
</P>
<P>
 "I never knew exactly what my husband was doing or how he was doing it," she 
said. "I never knew or met his Russian handlers." 
</P>
<P>
 Calling her husband of nine years "a master liar and manipulator," she 
declared that "exactly those qualities that made him a good intelligence 
officer for our country made him a deadly tool in the hands of the Russians." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have termed the Ames spy case one of the most damaging in U.S. 
history but have declined to specify what U.S. secrets and overseas operations 
Ames, 52, has acknowledged compromising between 1985 and 1994. They have 
disclosed, however, that he caused the deaths of as many as a dozen Soviet and 
Eastern Bloc officials who were cooperating with the CIA by revealing their 
identities to his Soviet counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 In his court-approved plea agreement last May, Ames accepted a term of life in 
prison without parole on condition that his wife receive about five years in 
prison for her role, subject to his cooperation with authorities in outlining 
his activities. He is now serving his sentence in Allenwood federal 
penitentiary in Pennsylvania. In the same agreement, Mrs. Ames said she would 
not challenge a government recommendation that she serve a sentence of 63 to 72 
months. But in recent weeks she had hired a new attorney and began efforts to 
persuade the judge to be more lenient. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilton's sentence amounted to the low end of that spread -- 63 months. John P. 
Hume, Mrs. Ames' attorney, told reporters that she would be credited with eight 
months already served since the couple's arrest last February and that she also 
could get 45 days a year off her sentence for good behavior. Thus, she could be 
released in less than four years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides picturing herself as a victim, Mrs. Ames pleaded for leniency so that 
she could resume raising the couple's 5-year-old son, Paul, who moved to 
Bogota, Colombia, to live with Mrs. Ames' mother after his parents' arrest. "I 
beg you, your honor, Paul needs me. Paul is innocent," she told Hilton. "He did 
nothing wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Hume said he would ask the U.S. Bureau of Prisons to incarcerate Mrs. Ames at 
the federal institution at Danbury, Conn., an easy drive from New York City. 
This would make it easier for the child and her mother to visit her in prison, 
since flights from Bogota to New York are quite frequent, Hume told reporters.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're not surprised by the sentence," Hume said outside the courthouse. "We 
hoped the judge would consider mitigating circumstances but he chose not to do 
so." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Plato Cacheris, who attended the sentencing as Aldrich Ames' 
lawyer, said afterward that his client had no objection to Mrs. Ames' harsh 
characterization of him. "It's understandable under the circumstances. He would 
not disagree with it," Cacheris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Hilton imposed sentence, Mark J. Hulkower, the assistant U.S. attorney 
who prosecuted the Ameses and signed their plea agreement, challenged Mrs. 
Ames' portrayal of herself as a victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling her "a greedy spouse," Hulkower said that her statements "are at odds 
with the facts of the conspiracy." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. Ames was concerned about one thing and one thing only, that Rick Ames 
get their money from the KGB. Is this how she expressed her opposition to the 
conspiracy? She lived a life of luxury with money from the KGB." 
</P>
<P>
 Hulkower noted that he and FBI agents had listened to thousands of hours of 
secretly recorded phone conversations between the Ameses for the nine months 
they were under surveillance before their arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "She says now she was blackmailed and pressured, but not once does she tell 
her husband to get out of this dirty business," the prosecutor said. "She does 
tell him to be more imaginative in carrying the documents and the money." 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development, the CIA on Friday released a 23-page unclassified 
abstract of its inspector general's report on the Ames case, an inquiry 
requested by the chairman and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence 
Committee shortly after the Ameses' arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 While the report by Frederick P. Hitz did not significantly add to what had 
already been disclosed about his investigation, it was blunt in its 
condemnation of agency failures to detect its most damaging mole at least two 
years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "His professional weaknesses were observed by Ames' colleagues and supervisors 
and were tolerated by many who did not consider them highly unusual for 
Directorate of Operations officers on the 'not going anywhere' promotion 
track," Hitz wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "That an officer with these observed vulnerabilities should have been given 
counterintelligence responsibilities in Soviet operations where he was in a 
prime position to learn of the intimate details of the agency's most sensitive 
operations, contact Soviet officials openly and then massively betray his trust 
is difficult to justify," Hitz wrote.

WHEN EAST MEETS WEST WITHIN THE SAME PERSON; LIFESTYLE: AFTER REALIZING THAT 
ONE CAN SAY 'THANK YOU' TOO OFTEN, IT'S NOW SECOND NATURE FOR A JOURNALIST OF 
EAST ASIAN ANCESTRY TO TURN THE CULTURAL SWITCHES ON AND OFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By K. CONNIE KANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like millions of Americans of East Asian ancestry, I feel blessed to have both 
Confucian and Judeo-Christian heritages to call my own. 
</P>
<P>
 The two coexist within me because of my dual identity as an Asian American. 
The teachings of the Chinese philosopher are part of my cultural DNA; they 
affect the way I think, work and conduct my private and public lives. But so do 
Judeo-Christian principles, because they provide the foundation of the American 
ethos which, too, has become part of me. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than four decades of living in both worlds, it's second nature to 
turn my cultural switches on and off. I bow when I meet visitors or immigrants 
from Korea, my birthplace, or Japan, where I spent my formative years. And I 
use an honorific if they happen to be my age or older. But if they're younger, 
I'll make sure to pick the appropriate level of speech, befitting their age and 
social position. 
</P>
<P>
 With my ever-present cultural antennae, I note how Confucianism, which so 
profoundly influenced East Asian approaches to love, family, education, 
humility, civility, and honesty, often conflicts with American ways. 
</P>
<P>
 The most glaring example is the American emphasis on verbalizing everything. 
In this culture, an ability to articulate is admired. In Confucian-influenced 
cultures, however, silence is a virtue. Talking is not. 
</P>
<P>
 Belatedly, after varied mishaps, I've also learned that in American culture, 
"yes" means "yes" and "no" means "no," but in East Asian cultures, a "yes" can 
be "yes," "maybe," "I'm listening," or even "no." 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to avoid having to say 'no' -- preferring indirect communication -- 
because it creates ill feelings," Nobuaki Hanaoka, a Japan-born theologian in 
Berkeley, told me. "We prize harmony in our culture above everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Going to school in the Midwest in the '60s, soon after my arrival in America, 
I remember classmates making fun of Confucius by pulling up their eyes and 
quoting something silly from a Chinese fortune cookie with: "Confucius says. . 
. . " 
</P>
<P>
 That they were making fun of the great teacher, venerated by Asians for 2,500 
years, didn't offend me. But their actions showed me that the cultural gap may 
be unconquerable. 
</P>
<P>
 Kung Fu-tzu, who was born 551 years before Christ, became Confucius in the 
West because Jesuit missionaries maimed his name. 
</P>
<P>
 The sage's system of ethics and rules for proper behavior is played out in 
America every day in countless interactions between people of Asian heritage 
and the rest of the population. The Asian tendency to be reserved, sometimes 
mistaken for aloofness here, is a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
 Confucianism thrived in Korea even more so than in the country of its birth. 
Koreans embraced Confucianism with such fervor that it became a state religion 
for six centuries, until 1910. Even today, Koreans remain die-hard Confucians, 
manifesting extremes of Confucianism with their preoccupation with hierarchy, 
age and ancestor worship. 
</P>
<P>
 For Asian American immigrants straddling different worlds, acculturation is a 
two-way street. 
</P>
<P>
 This I learned in the autumn of 1967, when I went to my ancestral land as a 
young newspaperwoman in search of my roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Having lived most of my life in the United States and Japan, where "thank you" 
is said often, it was my habit to use those words in response to a kind deed. 
</P>
<P>
 I was happily working on a Korean newspaper in Seoul on one November day when 
I got the cultural shock of my life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Miss Kang, you say 'thank you' too much," said Myong-sik Kim, a reporter who 
sat across from me, disapproval stamped on his face. 
</P>
<P>
 "What did you say?" I asked, to make sure I had heard him right. 
</P>
<P>
 "You say 'thank you' too often." 
</P>
<P>
 He explained that with a perfunctory "thank you" I was dismissing an act of 
kindness much too lightly. It would be better to say thank you less often, and 
instead think of a way to reciprocate at a later time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Confucius didn't tell Koreans not to thank people, but they seem to have 
carried his emphasis on maintaining decorum to the point where even salutations 
have to be properly restrained. 
</P>
<P>
 Koreans also have an aversion to using names. Instead, they call each other by 
titles. There are so many "presidents" among Korean immigrants in Los Angeles 
that one wonders if there are any employees left. Every Korean with a business 
is referred to as "president" -- even if it's a hole-in-the-wall bakery in 
Koreatown. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the Korean etiquette is to say: Teacher Yi, Lawyer Min and so on. 
Even a convicted felon gets a title: Convict Chun. 
</P>
<P>
 I get around this by addressing most Koreans I see as sunsaeng-nim , a polite 
catch-all word meaning teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Other differences separating East Asians from the Eurocentric American culture 
include the attitude toward humanity's place in the universe. 
</P>
<P>
 East Asians view society as a collection of families, whereas people of 
European roots operate from the 18th-Century idea of society as an assortment 
of individuals -- all pursuing their own interests. 
</P>
<P>
 The disparity manifests itself even in such routine things as names. East 
Asians use the family name first, followed by personal names -- a recognition 
of the superiority of the family over the individual. 
</P>
<P>
 King-Kok Cheung, an English professor at UCLA who is Chinese American, says 
she would like to see aspects of Asian culture, such as an appreciation for 
nonverbal communication, go mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of stressing that Asians become more "vocal," and spell out what they 
mean, Cheung suggests that non-Asians could benefit by cherishing nuances of 
silence and avoiding confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that will happen in the 21st century, being billed as the "Pacific 
Century." For now, I try to remember what Confucius said: "By nature, all men 
are so alike. It's by their habits they become so different."

MAN GETS 146 YEARS IN GANG RAPES OF 2 GIRLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 20-year-old Anaheim man was sentenced Friday to 146 years in prison for his 
part in gang rapes of two teen-age girls at a community center. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert De La Cruz, one of four suspected Anaheim gang members charged in the 
rapes, sat without visible emotion as Superior Court Judge Richard L. 
Weatherspoon announced the sentence. De La Cruz will be eligible for parole at 
the age of 92. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of his family sobbed in the courtroom. The victims were not present. 
</P>
<P>
 The two rapes occurred last year at the Anaheim Independencia Community 
Center, where the victims had become separated from their friends, according to 
a court sentencing report. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 12, a 15-year-old girl was held down by several people, and a knife 
was held to her neck while up to 12 youths raped her, the report said.  
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 7, a 14-year-old girl was raped by several people after being left 
behind by her girlfriends about 2:30 a.m., according to the sentencing report. 
After a struggle, the girl was thrown to the ground and knocked unconscious, 
remaining there about three hours.  
</P>
<P>
 In statements to authorities, De La Cruz admitted that he participated in the 
first rape after smoking methamphetamine. He told a probation officer it was 
"the worst thing I ever did by far." 
</P>
<P>
 He denied involvement in the second rape, saying he was at his girlfriend's 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Cruz, whom the judge called a "serious danger to society," has a long 
Juvenile Court record and was on probation at the time of the rapes for assault 
with a deadly weapon, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 He faced a maximum of 285 years in prison for his conviction on 22 counts of 
rape, using a weapon and aiding others in a crime, prosecutor Camille Hill 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Only four people in either rape have been identified by the victims or through 
DNA testing, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two juveniles have been sentenced to the California Youth Authority, where 
they can be held until they turn 25, while a third adult is awaiting trial, 
Hill said.

FIRE GUTS OXNARD HANGAR, MELTS 12 PLANES; BLAZE: EXPLOSIONS ROCK NEIGHBORHOOD, 
ROUSTING RESIDENTS FROM NEARBY APARTMENTS. OIL-SOAKED RAGS ARE SUSPECTED AS 
CAUSE. 
</P>

<P>
 Fire swept through a hangar at the Oxnard Airport early Friday, melting a 
dozen planes and setting off a succession of fireballs that rocked the 
neighborhood and turned the pre-dawn sky bright red. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4:24 a.m. blaze, which gutted the 32,000-square-foot hangar, caused an 
estimated $3.5 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's flat, completely gone," Oxnard Fire Department spokesman Bill Scobey 
said of the metal hangar that lay crumpled and smoldering hours after the fire 
was extinguished. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the cause of the fire was not immediately known, inspectors said 
Friday afternoon that they suspect a pile of oil-soaked rags may have 
spontaneously caught fire and ignited the blaze. But inspectors said the rags 
are only one of many possible sources and that it could take days or even weeks 
to determine the cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Planes, including two early morning commercial flights, took off and landed at 
the airport Friday without interruption. 
</P>
<P>
 The hangar is owned by Ventura County and leased to Venco Pacific Aviation, 
which rented space to private plane owners and ran a maintenance and aviation 
operation. A computer consultant and an accountant also had offices in the 
hangar. Venco owner Jim Schoenneman of Agoura Hills could not be reached for 
comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 As firefighters battled the blaze, soot and charred metal rained on an 
apartment complex across the street from the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Apartment residents, crowded in a nearby parking lot and cloaked in blankets 
to fend off the morning cold, said they feared that the wood-shingle roofs on 
their units would catch fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen anything like it before," said Connie Williams, who said she 
and her children were awakened by a series of explosions. "All this stuff was 
flying through the air. The whole sky was filled with sparks." 
</P>
<P>
 As explosions ripped through the hangar, panicked residents went door to door 
waking their neighbors. Some fled their homes in nightgowns and pajamas. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' 18-year-old son, Joe, said there were about a dozen explosions -- 
caused by gas tanks and other fuel sources -- over half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw big fireballs in the sky," he said. "The sky was totally red." 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was so intense that it melted everything in the hangar, including the 
12 planes, into an unrecognizable mass of metal. One plane, a turboprop 
Mitsubishi, was valued at $700,000, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scobey said 61 firefighters from the Oxnard and Ventura County fire 
departments took about 1 1/2 hours to put out the blaze.

ALLSTATE ADMITS POLITICAL CALLS WERE MISLEADING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Allstate Insurance Co. conceded Friday that some of its employees 
misrepresented themselves as speaking for a police group while soliciting votes 
by telephone for Republican candidate Charles Quackenbush in the insurance 
commissioner's race. 
</P>
<P>
 Delia Chilgren, head of Allstate's California political action group, said 
that fewer than one-third of the company volunteers were given scripts 
instructing them to say they spoke on behalf of the Peace Officers Research 
Assn. of California.She added that many "were uncomfortable" with the 
subterfuge and said instead that they were representing Quackenbush. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Assemblyman Quackenbush's Democratic opponent, state Sen. Art 
Torres, said the Torres campaign had sent a spy to one of the phone banks, at 
an Allstate office in Monrovia, and had listened as Allstate agents made their 
pitches for Quackenbush by saying they were representatives of the police 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Chilgren confirmed that one of the phone banks was at the Allstate Monrovia 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres' campaign manager, Dario Frommer, sent a letter to Allstate charging 
the company -- which has a 100% rate increase request for earthquake insurance 
premiums pending in the commissioner's office -- with "perpetrating fraud on 
California voters." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a crime in California to represent oneself as a peace officer," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the script, which was obtained by The Times, the Allstate agents 
were instructed to say they were "calling on behalf of" the police group, not 
to say they were police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The police group has endorsed Quackenbush, but its political director, Kelly 
Moran, said Friday that he has asked Allstate to stop its agents and other 
employees from using the group's name in their calls. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Quackenbush, Lynne Andersen, said the Republican's campaign 
apologizes if any misrepresentations were made and is sending a letter to 
Allstate asking that such misstatements be avoided.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 188; TOBACCO INDUSTRY USES NEW TACTIC IN ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Portraying their initiative as an anti-smoking measure, the tobacco industry 
is airing radio spots in which a woman identifying herself as a school vice 
principal claims that Proposition 188 will keep children away from cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 But California's top health official, and other critics of the measure on the 
Nov. 8 ballot, call the ad one more ruse to sell the initiative to California 
voters. They say Proposition 188 will repeal far stronger laws already on the 
books that limit minors' access to cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hard-pressed to see how 188 is a stronger approach to this very difficult 
problem," said California Health Director S. Kimberly Belshe. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Proposition 188 radio spot features a woman's voice claiming to be a 
vice principal. The voice describes Proposition 188 as the "best way to keep 
cigarettes away from kids." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been working with kids for 24 years," the voice says. "I know what 
motivates them, and I understand the way they think. I want to stop kids from 
smoking. Proposition 188 will help do that." 
</P>
<P>
 The commercial is the first to be broadcast in the campaign over the tobacco 
industry initiative, and represents a key component of cigarette makers' 
campaign to persuade voters that Proposition 188 is not merely an underhanded 
attempt to make it easier for smokers of their products to light up. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tobacco industry's claim of cracking down on kids' access to cigarettes 
is misleading at best and fraudulent at worst," said Assemblyman Terry B. 
Friedman (D-Brentwood), one of the harshest critics of Proposition 188.  
</P>
<P>
 Several other provisions of the measure also purport to restrict smoking. But 
for each one of the proposal's components, there are local ordinances or state 
anti-smoking laws that are tougher on smoking in public places. 
</P>
<P>
 If passed, Proposition 188 would repeal all local smoking ordinances and knock 
other state smoking laws off the books. Proponents say 188 contains all the 
restrictions necessary, and present the new ad to pitch that message. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad describes the initiative as a "common sense approach to help keep 
tobacco away from minors," and concludes by saying that the spot was sponsored 
by Californians for Statewide Smoking Restrictions -- which is funded by 
tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an important piece of the initiative, and an important part of the 
campaign," Lee Stitzenberger, strategist and spokesman for the pro-tobacco 
initiative, said of minors' access to cigarettes. He said the speaker in the 
radio ad is a public school vice principal, but would not name her or say where 
she works. She was not paid, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Stitzenberger previously said he had no plans to air radio or television ads. 
But with Proposition 188 leading among likely voters in a recent Times poll, 
that strategy has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Stitzenberger has reserved commercial time on television and radio stations 
statewide. A second radio spot features restaurant owners saying they support 
188 because they want the right to decide whether to permit smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 These campaign spots and others in the works are going unanswered by the 
initiative's foes, a struggling coalition of health groups and anti-smoking 
activists. Jack Nicholl, consultant to the No on 188 effort, said he hopes to 
air radio ads late in the campaign. Nicholl called the vice principal ad, which 
plays on people's desire to stop children from smoking, "the ultimate in 
cynicism." 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative would increase penalties for selling tobacco to minors, 
allowing for fines of up to $2,000. However, the initiative also is worded so 
that business owners can avoid fines by posting signs saying cigarette sales to 
minors are illegal, and having their employees sign statements saying they know 
it is against the law to sell cigarettes to children. 
</P>
<P>
 Belshe said she believes the initiative may repeal a tough new law aimed at 
stopping cigarettes to minors. The law, set to go into effect Jan. 1, would 
increase penalties to $6,000, authorize civil lawsuits against businesses that 
sell cigarettes to minors, and permit the Department of Health Services to join 
the enforcement effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Carried by Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), the bill was signed into law by 
Belshe's boss, Gov. Pete Wilson. Wilson and his Democratic challenger, 
Treasurer Kathleen Brown, oppose Proposition 188. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden said he wrote the bill to ensure that the initiative would not overturn 
it. But if Proposition 188 passes, there is likely to be a court fight to 
determine whether Hayden's law will stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the impact on Hayden's bill is unclear, the initiative repeals 150 
local ordinances that ban or significantly restrict cigarette vending machines, 
a major source of cigarettes for minors. The initiative would prevent local 
governments from passing new vending machines restrictions.

 * What's Ahead: President Clinton is scheduled to address a fund-raising 
dinner in San Francisco for Brown tonight. Wilson plans to discuss public 
safety during appearances in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SENATE RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Friday: Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, addressing the 
Commonwealth Club in San Francisco, announced her opposition to Proposition 
187, the ballot initiative that seeks to cut off public services to illegal 
immigrants. Republican Rep. Mike Huffington, continuing his bus tour to Hemet 
and Orange County, spoke out in support of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: Feinstein planned to join President Clinton in Belmont, where 
the President will sign legislation sponsored by Feinstein for zero tolerance 
of guns in schools. Feinstein planned to visit the Mexico-U.S. border near San 
Diego this evening. Huffington continues his bus tour to GOP offices throughout 
Orange County on Volunteer Mobilization Day. 
</P>
<P>
 NOTABLE QUOTES 
</P>
<P>
 "Iwill not support Proposition 187. I know that this could cost me votes, 
possibly even the election. . . . But I believe Proposition 187 won't solve the 
problem. It'll only make it worse." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sen. Dianne Feinstein, in a speech to the Commonwealth Club of San

 THE POLL 
</P>
<P>
 A poll sponsored by the San Francisco Examiner and television stations KNBC in 
Los Angeles and KCRA in Sacramento had Republican Gov. Wilson leading 
Democratic state Treasurer Brown by 48% to 43% among registered voters. Two 
weeks ago, a poll done by the same firm -- Political/Media Research Inc. of 
Washington -- had Wilson leading 47% to 42%. A KCBS-TV poll had Wilson leading 
Brown 50% to 37% among 1,000 likely voters.

NEWS ANALYSIS; STRIKING CANDOR EMERGES IN CLOSED-DOOR SESSION; COURTS: A 
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF POSTURING ALSO IS EVIDENT AS LAWYERS DISCUSS JURY SELECTION 
AND BAIL. AT ONE POINT, SHAPIRO REBUKES SIMPSON AND THREATENS TO QUIT. 
</P>

<P>
 O.J. Simpson is going broke. 
</P>
<P>
 Would-be jurors are "lying" to earn a seat on "The Case of the Century." 
</P>
<P>
 Police Department "scuttlebutt" has it that the judge held a secret meeting 
with prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers speak differently when the microphones are turned off, as those 
comments -- contained in newly released transcripts of a closed-door session in 
the Simpson murder case -- clearly show. 
</P>
<P>
 From cynical remarks by both sides about the potential jurors to a sharp 
rebuke from a lawyer to his client, the transcripts of the hearing in Superior 
Court Judge Lance A. Ito's courtroom show lawyers in the murder case speaking 
with what appears to be unusual candor. 
</P>
<P>
 A certain amount of posturing also was evident, however, and one legal expert 
suggested that some fancy choreography may have been at work -- despite the 
appearance of spontaneity. 
</P>
<P>
 During the closed-door session Wednesday, things got off to a hush-hush start 
when defense attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. made sure the in-courtroom 
microphones were turned off before he began to tell Ito about rumors of the 
alleged secret meeting between the judge and prosecutors. After Cochran 
described what he heard from an old Los Angeles Police Department friend, 
prosecutors denied that the meeting had taken place and Ito called the 
speculation "preposterous." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Steve Brill, editor of American Lawyer and founder of Court TV, said 
that a closed-door meeting was the right place to float such a report. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you hear about a rumor, that's the place to do it -- in chambers," Brill 
said. "You would have to have your head examined to say it in open court. 
</P>
<P>
 "There always a mix of communications, public and private, in any trial," 
Brill said. "But in this case the difference is much sharper because there is 
such an intense light shined on everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most unguarded portion of the meeting came when attorneys on both 
sides voiced strong doubts about the honesty of the jury pool being considered 
for the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyer Robert L. Shapiro started it, saying: "We have 300 people 
begging to be on the case of the century and will give you (Ito) any answer 
they want, unfortunately." 
</P>
<P>
 Then prosecutor Marcia Clark upped the ante: "Many if not most are lying to 
the detriment of the People because they're sitting there as the fans of this 
defendant, saying, 'We want to get on this jury because we want to turn a blind 
eye to your evidence and a deaf ear to the testimony so we can acquit this man 
no matter what.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, Clark told Ito she would like to subject the potential jurors 
to polygraph examinations. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal analysts said such comments were highly unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyer Barry Levin said the remarks about prospective jurors were the 
sort of comments attorneys might might make in private while having a drink, 
but certainly not in public. "All lawyers know prospective jurors lie," Levin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will lie to get off a jury and in this instance they'll lie to get on a 
jury. It's a reality that no one will admit in public," Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the closed hearing Wednesday was a preview of a later public hearing 
on the defense's unsuccessful move to persuade Ito to release Simpson on bail 
and to grant a one-year continuance in the case. This effort led to perhaps the 
most dramatic moment of the closed session as Simpson pleaded with Ito to let 
him out on bail to be with his two motherless children. 
</P>
<P>
 However, as Simpson started to discuss his state of mind during the now 
infamous low-speed chase before he surrendered, Shapiro suddenly broke in. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer -- who normally is seen whispering with his client, his arm around 
Simpson's shoulder -- declared sharply: "Mr. Simpson, I am telling you that I 
will not allow you to speak and I will resign as your lawyer if you continue to 
do so." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson immediately replied "thank you" and said nothing more, according to 
the transcripts, which were unsealed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 While arguing that Simpson should be released on bail, Shapiro claimed that 
his wealthy client's resources are dwindling rapidly. "I don't believe he's 
going to walk out, get on an airplane and go somewhere. His funds are virtually 
depleted, as everyone knows, because of two things that have been done. Trusts 
have been set up for his children and expenses for experts and lawyers and 
investigators to clear his good name." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyer Leslie Abramson said she was "astonished" at how sharply 
Shapiro talked to his client. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense lawyer Gerald L. Chaleff said: "I see why Bob stopped him. He 
started to talk about the evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Even for a case that has been high-pitched from the beginning, the tone of the 
hearing was particularly hyperbolic. Both sides reviled the media in terms even 
stronger than usual. At one point, Clark quoted a celebrity's comment that he 
"wouldn't allow his dog to urinate" on tabloid scandal sheets. 
</P>
<P>
 At another point, Cochran told the judge that this was the first time in his 
31 years as a lawyer that he felt his client could not get a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles defense lawyer Harland W. Braun said the tone of some of the 
remarks indicated that "they were lulled into a sense of comfort and privacy, 
forgetting that legally there is no such thing as a private session." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the defense originally asked for the session to held in private. At 
the end of the proceeding, prosecutor William Hodgman asked for the record to 
be sealed, but Shapiro said he strenuously opposed the request. 
</P>
<P>
 Braun said that clash indicated that defense lawyers felt that it was to their 
advantage to get the record before the public. In fact, he suggested that the 
defense team may have choreographed part of the session. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defense really won by getting this thing out," Braun said. "You get O.J. 
declaring his innocence and the prosecutor saying the jurors are liars."

COLD WAR SECRECY TIED TO RADIATION PERIL; ETHICS: CLOSED DEBATE ON GOVERNMENT'S 
ATOMIC TESTING DECADES AGO MEANT CONTRACTORS, RESEARCHERS WERE UNAWARE OF HUMAN 
DANGERS, REPORT SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Investigators reviewing the history of government-sponsored atomic experiments 
concluded Friday that Cold War secrecy and bureaucratic sprawl created a 
patchwork of policies that unwittingly exposed many humans to potentially 
dangerous radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 In a preliminary report, the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments 
found that senior government officials extensively debated the need for human 
experimentation and the policies that should govern it. But because that debate 
was often secret, many contractors and university researchers apparently were 
unaware of legal and ethical concerns surrounding the experiments they were 
paid to conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1954, for example, Secretary of Defense Charles E. Wilson directed that 
human radiation experiments conducted by the Defense Department should follow 
the strict code of medical ethics that emerged from the post-war Nuremberg 
trials. But he classified his directive "top secret," which meant that it could 
not be shared with many involved in the programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one of the most intriguing and perplexing problems we came up with," 
said Ruth Faden, a medical ethicist from Johns Hopkins University named to lead 
the 14-member panel. "We are still trying to figure out why anybody in his 
right mind would adopt an ethical policy and then classify it secret." 
</P>
<P>
 Faden said that her panel, established by Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary last 
April, has largely documented the existence of some 400 government-sponsored 
radiation experiments that exposed humans to radiation between 1947 and 1977. 
But Faden added that, by the time the huge data-gathering effort is completed, 
the number of experiments "will probably be in the thousands." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those are hundreds of experiments in which Energy Department contractors 
intentionally released radiation into the general population to study its 
effects. That is many times more than the 13 intentional releases the committee 
had known about earlier, including one in which radiation released from a 
planned rocket malfunction drifted over Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of appearances, however, committee members said it was clear that the 
experiments were not conducted in an ethical vacuum. Faden said there were 
active debates, some involving senior officials, university leaders and leading 
scientists, about what ethical guidelines should govern the experiments. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when guidelines were drafted in the open and made available widely, they 
apparently were not always carried out in the field. In many cases, scientists 
seemed unsure which government agency's policy governed their research. 
</P>
<P>
 In other cases, there was confusion over such questions as whether guidelines 
governing experimentation on normal, healthy adults extended to those who were 
in institutions or gravely ill. 
</P>
<P>
 While the committee found evidence of ethical debates, Faden said, "it would 
be a mistake to leave the impression . . . that this discussion was a result of 
ethical soul-searching about whether this was something we ought to be 
undertaking as a nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the debate that took place in late 1940s and early 1950s "may well 
have been animated by straightforward legal concerns about liability -- we're 
not sure about that -- but also perhaps about insurance and public relations 
issues," Faden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Secrecy also has hampered efforts to construct a full picture of the 
government's vast apparatus of experimentation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Significant collections of relevant material are still classified," the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Energy Department, which is being pressed by O'Leary to be more 
forthcoming on nuclear matters, has said that it must protect much of the 
documentation on 250 tests in which radioactive lanthanum was intentionally 
released into the atmosphere by Los Alamos Laboratories in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The Defense Department has similarly refused to declassify information related 
to a 1949 experiment in which it released radioisotopes into the atmosphere 
from the Hanford Nuclear Plant in Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee members said that the Central Intelligence Agency also has been 
reluctant to locate and declassify documents about its participation in the 
planning of government-sponsored human experiments involving radioactivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Faden and six of the committee's staff members have been granted security 
clearances allowing them to comb through millions of pages of secret documents.

LASER TO CORRECT MYOPIA GETS QUALIFIED OK FROM SCIENTISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scientific advisers to the government are recommending approval of the 
nation's first laser device to correct nearsightedness but only if it meets 
strict safety guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a technology that has enormous potential," said Dr. Olivia 
Serdarevic, one of the experts who recommended Food and Drug Administration 
approval of the laser Thursday night. "Our dilemma tonight . . . is that the 
data presented is not sufficient to say it's totally safe." 
</P>
<P>
 By a 13-1 vote, the panel told the FDA that the laser, sold under the brand 
name OmniMed, should be approved as soon as its maker, Summit Technology Inc., 
proves that: 
</P>
<P>
 * Seventy-five percent of its patients have their vision improve to 20/25 or 
better without glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fewer than 5% of patients have their vision worsen as result of the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Summit says 78% of its patients abandon their glasses -- but many of those do 
so with vision worse than 20/25. And estimates of vision problems from the 
laser range from 3% to 7%, a number the panel insisted be pinned down. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel said doctors must be properly trained to use the lasers. Also 
patient brochures must warn that it only helps mild-to-moderate nearsightedness 
and that it poses some risk of vision loss and glare problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA is not obliged to accept the recommendations of its outside advisers, 
but it usually does. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is a surgical technique called photo-refractive keratectomy, or PRK, 
which some doctors say is safer and more precise than the current eye surgery 
that 250,000 Americans undergo each year. That surgery is radial keratotomy, or 
RK. 
</P>
<P>
 In RK, a surgeon uses a knife to make tiny cuts on the cornea, the clear 
tissue covering the iris and pupil. The cuts flatten misshapen corneas to bring 
vision closer to normal. PRK also flattens the cornea, using a cold beam of 
ultraviolet light to vaporize corneal cells. But it has some risks similar to 
RK, including a tendency for some patients to over-correct and thus require 
reading glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers for Summit Technology of Waltham, Mass., presented data on 700 
patients treated with the laser over the past two years. About 78% of the 
patients no longer needed corrective lenses.

BRIGHT NEW LAMP SHARPLY CUTS LIGHTING COSTS; TECHNOLOGY: GOLF-BALL SIZE 
PROTOTYPE EQUALS ILLUMINATION OF HUNDREDS OF MERCURY-VAPOR BULBS. FIRST USES 
LIKELY TO BE IN SHOPPING CENTERS, FACTORIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CURT SUPLEE, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Energy Department has unveiled what it called "a revolutionary 
21st-Century" lighting system that uses a bulb of sulfur bombarded by 
microwaves to produce bright illumination resembling sunlight -- and does so at 
a fraction of the cost of many conventional systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The prototype lamp, invented by a Rockville, Md., start-up company called 
Fusion Lighting Inc. and developed under contract to the Energy Department, 
consists of a closed quartz sphere filled with an inert gas and a tiny amount 
of sulfur. One golf-ball-sized sulfur bulb, when irradiated by the kind of 
compact microwave generator found in ordinary kitchen ovens, puts out as much 
light as hundreds of high-intensity mercury vapor lamps. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is "a major technological breakthrough in lighting," said Christine 
Ervin, assistant secretary for energy efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial products are not expected until some time in 1995, and the first 
applications are likely to be in lighting extensive outdoor and indoor spaces 
such as shopping centers, aircraft hangars and factories. Illuminating such 
areas now costs the United States about $8 billion per year, Ervin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first large-scale use of the lamp is being tested at the department's 
Washington headquarters. Two of the bulbs -- shining into each end of a 
240-foot, 10-inch-diameter reflective plastic pipe -- have been installed in 
the building's entry area, which was previously lit by 240 175-watt mercury 
lamps. The new system, which uses less than 12,000 watts, produces four times 
as much light at about one-third the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar test is being conducted at the National Air and Space Museum, where 
three 90-foot light pipes powered by sulfur bulbs have replaced 94 separate 
conventional fixtures in one display area. The test units put out three times 
more light at a 25% saving in cost, Ervin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also important, said Frank A. Florentine, the museum's lighting director, is 
that the sulfur bulb emits much less ultraviolet light than traditional 
devices. UV radiation "is damaging to nearly everything" in the exhibits, he 
said -- notably uniforms and space suits, some of which have already had to be 
replaced or renovated because they bleached or dried out under the existing 
lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most other high-intensity lighting sources, the sulfur lamp has no 
electrodes, which are "the principal limitation to achieving long life in 
conventional bulbs," Ervin said. And because there is no evidence that the 
sulfur reacts chemically to degrade the quartz, the lamp may not wear out for 
years. "We just don't know how long they'll last," said Fusion Lighting Vice 
President Kent Kipling. 
</P>
<P>
 The DOE expects initial lifetimes of 10,000 to 20,000 hours. The developers 
expect the sulfur bulb to sustain nearly peak output throughout its life. 
</P>
<P>
 The sulfur bulb emits a white light that is optically similar to sunlight. In 
initial agricultural tests, Kipling said, "plants behave as if they're seeing 
sunlight." NASA has a two-year contract with the company to develop lights for 
growing plants in space. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Anderson, DOE's project manager for lighting research, said that the 
quality of light will be especially important to the increasingly detailed work 
done in U.S. high-tech factories.

CITYSCAPES / NORA ZAMICHOW: 'MANY THINGS IN L.A. DON'T FEEL SAFE ANYMORE. HERE,

SIMPLER PLEASURES

 Every week, 6-year-old Melody Alarcon and her sister Laura, 9, start bugging 
their mom in the morning. "Can we go? Can we go tonight?" they cajole. 
</P>
<P>
 Yep, mom says. And so with surprisingly large numbers of folks from South 
Pasadena to Visalia, they converge at the Friday night Monrovia family festival 
and farmer's market, one of the few places left in Southern California where 
6,000 strangers can share neighborly intimacy. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just the low prices. (Lettuce, for instance, sells for 50 cents a 
head.) Nor is it the freshness and the flavor. (If you think an apple is a 
wax-covered, grainy fruit, you have not bitten into the crisp, juice-dripping 
apples at Nick Pritchett's produce stand.) 
</P>
<P>
 No, passersby sigh, what makes this little San Gabriel Valley community 
special on a Friday night is the fragile feeling of small-town America, the way 
it once was, the way they remember it, when you could walk at night without 
double-checking that your purse is zippered shut. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when some cities have been forced to invoke evening curfews to avoid 
violence, Monrovia closes a main thoroughfare to traffic to host the farmers 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 From 5 to 9 p.m., Myrtle Avenue in the Old Town section is transformed into a 
suburban street festival replete with kiddie rides and crafts vendors, whose 
wares include hand-knit baby sweaters, carved mobiles, jewelry and assorted 
kitsch. 
</P>
<P>
 The regulars come week after week, meeting friends, browsing the booths, 
inhaling the wafting smells of sizzling Cajun sausages and hot funnel cakes. 
It's the kind of place where vendors offer free strawberries and wedges of 
watermelon. If you ask about a weird-looking exotic fruit, its seller will 
probably press it in your hand saying, "Here, try one." 
</P>
<P>
 And in a world that sometimes seems so filled with potential dangers, this is 
an oasis for children, who roam the closed-off street playing hopscotch over 
the double-yellow lines dividing the lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Melody is the Mario Andretti wanna-be of Krazy Kars. With $2 from her mom, 
Melody has her pick of the miniature battery-powered cars corralled behind a 
metal fence. Melody gravely selects a red convertible, and pulls sister Laura 
along. When the older girl protests that she can scarcely fit into the vehicle, 
Melody pleads: "You know I can't really drive."' 
</P>
<P>
 So with Laura sitting more out than in the toy car, the two girls putter off 
in an enclosed area the size of a tiny yard. On the other side of the fence, 
their mother, Holly Alarcon, a Monrovia artist, sighs. "Melody can't steer," 
she says. "She'll probably be like this when she's 16." 
</P>
<P>
 As though on cue, her daughters crash head-on into a barricade, making a loud 
grating noise as the tiny vehicle pushes the fence along the pavement. The 
girls dissolve into giggles, switch seats, and crash again. 
</P>
<P>
 Holly Alarcon covers her eyes. "I can't watch."  
</P>
<P>
 Just a few feet away, 5-year-old McKenna Miliei is contemplating her own 
dilemma: Pony rides? Or the giant air pillow being jumped on by about half a 
dozen kids? 
</P>
<P>
 Breaking into a trot, McKenna yells: "The bouncies!" 
</P>
<P>
 Like many who are here tonight, McKenna's parents, Kelly and Don Miliei of 
South Pasadena, have incorporated the street festival into their weekly 
routine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came once and that was it," said Kelly Miliei. "Many things in L.A. don't 
feel safe anymore. Here, I don't have to be looking around. I don't have to 
worry about police protection." 
</P>
<P>
 McKenna and her 4-year-old sister, Rhya, abandon the air cushion in search of 
better game. Ahh, Pluck-a-Duck. After plunking down 50 cents, McKenna picks a 
plastic duck floating in a big tub and smiles while she gets her prize, a tiny 
dinosaur. Rhya is luckier. Her duck yields a pair of hot pink sunglasses. It 
has a blue paper invitation to a church service attached by a rubber band, 
which the little girl rips off in her eagerness to try on the glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Their father, a free-lance photographer, tries to explain the powerful draw 
that the farmer's market wields over his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pedestrian gets to have their way," he said. "Nobody looks over their 
shoulder crossing the street. It's an American version of European strolling." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Hoeks and his wife, Jeneva, hit several farmer's markets a week, selling 
produce for their daughter and her husband, who farm 31 acres in Visalia. The 
elder couple winters in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're people people," said Jeneva Hoeks. "When we're tired of being retired, 
we do this." 
</P>
<P>
 For them, it's a labor of love, not money. But for Nick Pritchett, a college 
senior, and Amy Vega, a graduate student, it's both. 
</P>
<P>
 Pritchett and Vega are working their way through school by selling the fruits 
and vegetables from his father's 270-acre farm. They go to several daytime 
markets each week. It's fast money at the Hermosa Beach farmers market, lots of 
complaining customers at Torrance, huge crowds at Santa Monica. And the most 
fun at Monrovia, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the people," Pritchett says. "It's low key." 
</P>
<P>
 Pritchett's tables are loaded with baby potatoes (red and white), onions (red 
and white) and crunchy apples. The neighboring tables, too, beckon with a 
cornucopia of Southern California fall harvest: seedless grapes, white corn, 
radishes, hot peppers and snap peas. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Marino's weekly ritual for attending the farmers market includes 
putting her six pet ducks to bed early while her daughter, Crystal, makes sure 
their rabbits, Lucky and Midnight, and hamster, Blondie, have snacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, in their quest for dinner, Marino and Crystal pass Pritchett's and 
other produce booths, gazing beyond the cinnamon pulls and sticky buns. 
Crystal, a fourth-grader, craves pizza. Sandra Marino considers a baked potato. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marinos, who live in Monrovia, greet their friends, regaling them with 
animal escapades. And, in matching pink outfits, they just stroll, wrapped arm 
in arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the atmosphere," Sandra Marino said. "It's the family outing."

PUBLIC HEALTH CARE IN JEOPARDY, REPORT SAYS; MEDICINE: UCLA STUDY'S BLEAK 
FINDINGS ABOUT L.A. COUNTY SYSTEM OVERSHADOW FIRST SUMMIT MEETING OF NORMALLY 
CONTENTIOUS FACTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS P. SHUIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sobered by a new UCLA study declaring that taxpayer-financed health programs 
in Los Angeles County are "in danger of collapse," an unusual collection of 
normally contentious factions in the health community held their first summit 
meeting Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, prepared by the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research and released 
at the start of the meeting, represents the most comprehensive profile yet of 
the county's massive health care delivery system. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA researchers examined data, some of which has been published before 
and some of which is new, from documents, public records and vital statistics 
for the county and previous studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Its bleak findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * Between 1988 and 1992, the county's non-elderly population increased by 7%, 
but the number of uninsured people increased by 32%; those on Medi-Cal, a 
subsidized health program for the poor, grew by 46%. These disparities 
reflected high unemployment and bad economic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Only about 60% of the county's 2-year-olds are adequately immunized, well 
below the 90% goal set by county health officials. The numbers are even worse 
for African American children, 25% of whom were fully immunized, and Latino 
children, 45% of whom received the full slate of recommended vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
 * More than one-quarter, or 28%, of the non-elderly population in Los Angeles 
County reported having no regular doctor, a key indicator of poor access to 
health care services. 
</P>
<P>
 * About 15% of the 22,000 inmates in county-operated jails at any given time 
are considered to be mentally ill, with 8% considered severely mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
 * The health system is about $425 million short of meeting its public health 
care needs, a shortfall that could lead to the closing of hospitals or health 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
 * The county's diversity offers numerous health challenges. The study said 
breast cancer was the leading cause of death among women in the county; 
complications from AIDS is the leading cause of death among men between 25 and 
44; African Americans suffered higher than average rates of infant mortality 
and deaths from heart disease, cancer, stroke and homicides. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost as eye-catching as the report's findings was the makeup of the 
coalition of health care policy-makers who gathered in a conference hall at 
USC: county, state and federal elected officials, hospital administrators, 
county health providers, Skid Row health workers and academic researchers. 
</P>
<P>
 The gathering was described by most of those present as "a first step" that 
could ultimately lead to a statewide ballot proposition or at least a more 
formal response to some of the changes being proposed by others in the health 
care system. 
</P>
<P>
 The more than two dozen members of the coalition represent, for the most part, 
a solid wall of opposition to two propositions on the Nov. 8 ballot. One, 
Proposition 186, would radically reform the health care system by implementing 
a single-payer health care arrangement that calls for the state to replace 
private health insurance companies. The other, Proposition 187, the 
anti-illegal immigrant measure, would cut off all non-emergency health care to 
undocumented residents. 
</P>
<P>
 On another front, most of the coalition members said they are feeling pinched 
by the state's efforts to move welfare recipients into managed care programs, 
which threatens to turn county health programs topsy-turvy by changing 
traditional methods of health care financing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Two years ago this meeting wouldn't have been possible," said David Langness, 
a spokesman for the Hospital Council of Southern California, which sponsored 
the event. "What this summit does is start the process toward a plan that 
everybody in the health care field can agree upon. We have had so much 
infighting in the past that we could never have been able to agree on which 
direction we should go." 
</P>
<P>
 Sparks flew at times during the daylong meeting, but the somewhat shaky 
coalition seemed to hold. Money, usually the source of most problems in health 
care turf wars, once again was at the root of friction at the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Complaining that California is being shortchanged in federal Medicaid 
payments, Robert Gates, director of the county Department of Health Services, 
distributed charts showing that New Hampshire is receiving $7,767 per Medicaid 
recipient, New York $3,699, while California is dead last at $1,301 per 
recipient. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates blamed the state for not being aggressive enough in pursuing federal 
Medicaid dollars. Other local health officials criticized California members of 
Congress for not keeping up with other states. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles), in turn, said he would like to see some 
creative local proposals that would raise funds to correct some of the 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't just go to Congress and the Legislature and say, 'These are the 
facts. Give us the money,' " Becerra said. "We want to know how are we going to 
come up with the money? How are we going to cut down on the bureaucracy?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Becerra said he thought the meeting was worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always productive when you get the different players in the same room," 
he said. "We all agree on one thing: We must come up with a way to solve the 
looming crisis for health care in Los Angeles County."

PROP. 187 SPARKS MORE HIGH SCHOOL WALKOUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 The wave of high school walkouts in protest of Proposition 187 continued 
throughout Southern California on Friday and in one case the demonstrations 
turned turbulent, as sheriff's deputies fired two non-lethal rubber grenades to 
disperse a crowd of protesters in Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second consecutive Friday marked by anti-Proposition 187 
demonstrations by students. A week before, about 1,500 students from junior and 
senior high schools in Los Angeles and several of its southeastern suburbs left 
their classrooms to demonstrate against the controversial proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 In Costa Mesa, about 100 students walked out of Estancia High School about 1 
p.m. Friday and marched down the street shouting, "Viva la raza!" and "Mexico, 
Mexico, Mexico!" 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 Oxnard students walked out of Rio Mesa High School on Friday morning 
and marched several miles toward Oxnard High School in protest of the 
proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure's best-known provisions would bar illegal immigrants from public 
schooling, non-emergency health care and social services. Proponents say the 
measure would help curb continuing, large-scale illegal immigration. Opponents 
consider the measure to be poorly drafted and a xenophobic invitation to harass 
the foreign-born. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies fired "stingball" grenades shortly before 4 p.m. to disperse a crowd 
of 450 to 500 people who gathered at Hunsaker Avenue and Alondra Boulevard in 
Paramount, said Sheriff's Sgt. Ron Spear. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured by the stingballs -- explosive devices that emit rubber 
pellets, Spear said -- and there were no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Students from Paramount walked out of classes shortly after 9 a.m., deputies 
said, and went to Dominguez High School, about two miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez Principal Fred Easter said that the march was peaceful and that 
deputies had the protesters under surveillance. The marchers then walked from 
the Dominguez campus to Jordan High School in Long Beach, and returned to 
Dominguez at lunchtime, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities blocked the intersection of Hunsaker and Alondra near the 
Dominguez campus, but the students were not cooperative when police attempted 
to disperse them, Easter said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that most of the demonstrators were from Paramount High but that some 
Dominguez students were involved. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstration began with about 50 students, Spear said, but by 3:45 p.m. 
the march had picked up another 400 students and adults. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, school district officials reported anti-Proposition 187 
walkouts at four high schools Friday. During peaceful demonstrations, students 
briefly left their classes in the morning at El Camino Real in Woodland Hills 
and Jordan in Watts. Noontime walkouts occurred at Palisades in Pacific 
Palisades and at Lincoln in Lincoln Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 In Costa Mesa, Estancia High junior Carlos Hernandez said, "I think 
(Proposition 187) is just an excuse to get us (Latinos) out of here." 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Alvarado, a drug counselor at the school who tried unsuccessfully to 
persuade students not to leave, said he nevertheless supported their protest. 
If Proposition 187 passes, he said, "It's just going to explode. . . . You're 
targeting the kids as a vehicle to get to a bigger problem, and that's not 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 Students in Oxnard marched a block from Oxnard High before they were stopped 
by police. They then retreated to Plaza Park, where police put them on school 
buses that took them home. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Union High School District officials, worried that students at Oxnard 
High would join the march, asked police to detain the protesters before they 
reached school grounds.  
</P>
<P>
 The march was generally peaceful, police said, although a few students threw 
rocks at passing cars. Community correspondent Alan Erely in Costa Mesa 
contributed to this story.

TWO LAPD OFFICERS ARE WOUNDED IN SHOOTOUT; CRIME: ONE VICTIM IS IN CRITICAL 
CONDITION AFTER GUNFIRE ERUPTS IN HOLLYWOOD LATE FRIDAY. POLICE ARE SEEKING 
SUSPECTED GANG MEMBER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two Los Angeles police officers were wounded -- one seriously -- by gunfire 
Friday night in Hollywood, and a SWAT team and dozens of other officers 
barricaded Sunset Boulevard searching for a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 One wounded officer, identified only as 34 years old, was in "very critical 
condition" at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, said a hospital spokeswoman. The 
officer was reportedly shot in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 The other officer suffered superficial injuries and was taken to Queen of 
Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in "non-critical" condition, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunfire erupted about 9 p.m. in the 5600 block of Sunset Boulevard at the 
Dunes Motel. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Capt. Bruce Hagerty said that the Hollywood Division officers made a 
traffic stop and that a follow-up investigation took them to a room at the 
motel.  
</P>
<P>
 "When the officers approached the suspect, the door opened and there was an 
exchange of gunfire between the officers and suspect," Officer Sandra Costello 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Suddenly, gunshots rang out," said a hotel worker, who declined to give his 
name. "And then all hell broke out. Everybody started running." 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can see is a lot of police," said the worker. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police asked us to turn all the lights out. Sunset is blocked off. Nobody 
can get in or out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 LAPD patrol cars were fanned out in front of the motel as officers 
scurried in and out. 
</P>
<P>
 A police SWAT team entered the room shortly after 11 p.m., but found that it 
was empty. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect was described as a very thin, 6-foot-2 light-skinned Latino who is 
believed to be a local gang member. Police officials said the suspect is at 
large and is considered armed and dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Bystanders who gathered near the police barricade said they could smell tear 
gas wafting through the air shortly after SWAT officers were seen entering the 
motel from the rear and roof areas. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles City Fire Department spokesman said both wounded officers were 
in uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Troi Martin, a passerby, said he saw two police officers, with guns drawn, 
approaching a car in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I got closer, the gunshots started going off. I just heard a bunch of 
gunshots and I stopped and ducked," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he saw other police officers arrive, run up the stairs and grab 
someone. 
</P>
<P>
 "About a half a dozen cops brought this person down and tossed him in the back 
of a police car. He obviously had been wounded," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the constant threat of violence in their jobs, shootings of police 
officers have been relatively rare in recent years in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, rookie LAPD Officer Christy Lynn Hamilton was shot and 
killed while responding to a domestic dispute in Northridge. And last year, 
Officer Ray Mendoza was wounded by a suspected gang member.

SUBWAY TO BE AUDITED BY U.S. INSPECTOR; TRANSIT: DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION 
OFFICIALS WILL MEET WITH MTA REPRESENTATIVES MONDAY TO BEGIN INQUIRY INTO 
CONSTRUCTION AND MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Transportation's inspector general will audit the costs 
and management of ongoing construction of the Los Angeles subway, according to 
officials familiar with the review. 
</P>
<P>
 As they start the review, representatives of the inspector general are 
scheduled to meet Monday with auditing staff and executives of the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal audit -- which will include construction of tunnels and stations 
along Wilshire Boulevard, Vermont Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard -- has been 
prompted in part by the inspector general's review of deficiencies in tunnels 
Downtown that are open to train service. 
</P>
<P>
 After an August, 1993, Times report, specialists retained by MTA Chief 
Executive Officer Franklin E. White found that tunnel walls between Union 
Station and Pershing Square were built with concrete thinner than specified. 
Results of a parallel outside review released last February found that the 
MTA's inspection management firm, Parsons-Dillingham, fell short of "acceptable 
industry practice" in its supervision of the first 4.4 miles of subway 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Repairs to the Downtown tunnels began seven months ago and are nearing 
completion. White informed MTA board members Friday that the repairs have 
included pumping more than 1,000 cubic yards of concrete-based grout -- the 
equivalent of about 100 full-size cement truck loads -- into the tunnel areas 
to fill voids. 
</P>
<P>
 The repairs, performed at spots along 1.9 miles of the twin tunnels, have been 
made at the expense of the original construction contractor, Tutor-Saliba 
Corp., and overseen by the construction management firm Parsons-Dillingham, 
also at no expense to taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are coming to the end of a painful chapter in the building of the Metro 
Red Line tunnels," White said, adding that the repair work "demonstrates our 
insistence that contractors make good on their contracts." 
</P>
<P>
 The new audit, meanwhile, follows the Clinton Administration's decision Oct. 5 
to cut off $1.6 billion of future funding for subway expansion until federal 
officials are satisfied that the MTA can competently manage the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest contract on the project -- 12 miles of twin tunnels connecting 
Wilshire and Hollywood boulevards -- is mired in disputes that threaten to add 
tens of millions of dollars of cost and postpone the system's scheduled opening 
in 1998. Tunneling in Hollywood has been shut down since Aug. 18, when surface 
sinkage of up to nine inches were confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Transit Administrator Gordon J. Linton has ordered that tunneling not 
resume until federal officials approve the MTA's plans and are satisfied that 
the work can be done safely. The federal government has provided about half -- 
the largest share -- of the funding for the Los Angeles subway. Linton is to 
meet privately with White and other officials Monday in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 White could not be reached late Friday regarding the inspector general's 
audit. In a memo to MTA board members earlier in the day, he defended his 
decision to not seek terminations of either Parsons-Dillingham or the tunneling 
contractor in Hollywood, Shea-Kiewit-Kenny. 
</P>
<P>
 An engineering firm retained by White to assess the construction along 
Hollywood Boulevard concluded this week that the substitution of wood wedges 
for steel bracing in the tunnels was "inappropriate." The wedges failed beneath 
the worst areas of the surface sinkage. The engineering firm found that the 
wood wedges were installed improperly and that concrete material was not placed 
around them, as required. 
</P>
<P>
 The substitution of the wood for the steel was approved by Parsons-Dillingham 
and the MTA's lead tunnel design engineer, employed by the firm of Parsons 
Brinckerhoff. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development on Friday, a state legislator who represents much of 
Hollywood urged U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena not to permit a 
resumption of the tunneling until the MTA has completely addressed the 
deficient installation of the wood bracing. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) said that White's recently 
surfaced proposal to resume excavation "is premature and wholly inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
 "The tunnel liner is improperly installed," Polanco said. ". . . . This 
project should not move forward until all substandard work is completely 
repaired and constructed as required by the original contract document. 
Anything less would be sweeping these very serious violations under the rug." 
</P>
<P>
 Polanco also told Pena that a tour of the Hollywood tunnels by his state 
legislative staff found construction shortcomings that "would be clearly 
visible to any person in the tunnel, especially any inspectors." 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons-Dillingham executives have accused Shea-Kiewit-Kenny of deliberately 
concealing deficient work from inspectors. Representatives of Shea-Kiewit-Kenny 
have declined to comment publicly. In a letter this week to MTA board members, 
the contractor's top excuetive, John F. Shea, faulted Metro Rail officials for 
not requiring the use of soil-stabilizing grout products that typically are 
used to minimize surface sinkage.

CIVIC ARTS PLAZA OPENS WITH A FLOURISH; THOUSAND OAKS: PATRONS DRESSED TO THE 
NINES GREET RIBBON-CUTTING MAYOR WITH A STANDING OVATION AS DREAM AT LAST 
BECOMES REALITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Buoyed by a standing ovation, an elated Mayor Alex Fiore on Friday slashed a 
red ribbon to open Thousand Oaks' new auditorium, presenting residents, at long 
last, with their coveted cultural center. 
</P>
<P>
 The gala aimed to launch Thousand Oaks into an elite stratum. With a flounce 
and a flourish, the one-time ranching town proudly displayed its new mandate: 
to showcase the best in professional theater, music and dance while nurturing 
local talent as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are witness to a history-making event," Fiore told the crowd. "Tonight's 
event has been nearly 25 years in the making." 
</P>
<P>
 Touting their performance center as world class, Thousand Oaks leaders hope to 
draw audiences from the San Fernando Valley to Santa Barbara. They reached out 
to that broad sweep of Southern California on Friday evening, hosting a 
sparkling party to tell the region Thousand Oaks had arrived. An even more 
glitzy bash will take place tonight -- a black-tie celebration expected to last 
until 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 But patrons attending the Friday night gala found the atmosphere thrilling 
enough, even without the free champagne, pressed tuxedos and glittery evening 
gowns that will crowd the 1,800-seat auditorium this evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care what they say about (tonight's) gala, this is the real grand 
opening," John Otte said. "This is fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing from a second story balcony, volunteer Cathy Shutz noted with 
satisfaction: "Everyone's all decked out. Look at all those jewels and 
spangles." 
</P>
<P>
 As they filed into the Probst Auditorium, guided by beaming ushers in black 
and purple uniforms, spectators twisted and craned to look at the theater's 
intricate details. They gazed at the multifaceted walls, designed to bounce 
sound evenly throughout the hall; the deep purple seats, covered with 
flame-retardant fabric; and the gently curving aisles, patterned after European 
concert halls. 
</P>
<P>
 First-time visitors often shared the amazement of Lynn Youngren, a choir 
member who had stood stock-still on stage for a solid five minutes before her 
first rehearsal in the Civic Arts Plaza earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm soaking it up," Youngren had said, eyes wide. "I'm just in awe. It's 
gorgeous." 
</P>
<P>
 For all its elegance, however, the theater still bore a slightly unfinished 
look. Yellow 'caution' tapes still cordoned off the park outside the 
illuminated Civic Arts Plaza. And the bougainvillea vines designed to curl 
around outdoor pillars stretched only a few feet out of the pots. 
</P>
<P>
 "The volume of work, and the volume of dirt produced by that work, is such 
that it could take weeks or months to completely clean up," technical 
production manager Gary Mintz said before the grand opening. "New theaters 
always have a sheen of plaster dust over them for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But on Friday, nobody cared. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore and council members Judy Lazar and Frank Schillo strode triumphantly on 
stage at 8 p.m. to a standing ovation. Councilwomen Elois Zeanah and Jaime 
Zukowski, two outspoken critics of the plaza's costs, did not attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after Fiore snipped the ribbon stretched across the broad stage, the 
Conejo Symphony Orchestra launched into a thunderous performance, greeted by 
equally thunderous applause. On the program: the national anthem and the aptly 
named "Festival Overture" and "Ode to Joy." 
</P>
<P>
 Demonstrating the theater's versatility in attracting international superstars 
and local artists alike, the opening-night program featured a 200-member 
community choir in the first act, followed by Broadway veteran Bernadette 
Peters after intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've talked to many people who probably never would have come to a concert 
like this, but they were thrilled to pieces to have it right here in town," 
said Alyce Schuldt, whose husband sang in the chorus. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the spirited three-hour show, Thousand Oaks leaders tried to move beyond 
the lingering controversy about the size and cost of the Civic Arts Plaza. They 
shifted their focus instead to the thrilling -- and sometimes risky -- business 
of running a first-class theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in this maiden season, members of the performance center's Board of 
Governors believe they will record a small profit. If the Alliance for the Arts 
meets its commitment to contribute $250,000 from the endowment fund, the 
theater department could end up about $25,000 in the black. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a hard, cold budget," said Julian Macdonald, chair of the Board of 
Governor's operations and finance committee. "We really sat down and locked 
everything in. We're moving forward on this thing, and it's going to be good." 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure booming business at the box office, Theater Director Tom Mitze has 
booked a season crammed with guaranteed hits. 
</P>
<P>
 The inaugural season includes such perennial favorites as the "The Nutcracker" 
ballet and "The Music Man." The professional Theater League troupe will bring 
in tried-and-true Broadway musicals such as "A Chorus Line" and "42nd Street." 
And a dozen superstars will hold solo performances: Ray Charles, Willie Nelson, 
Bill Cosby, Liza Minelli, and more. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to attract whole families, Mitze has also arranged for a strong lineup 
of children's shows, from "The Velveteen Rabbit" to "The Secret Garden," from 
juggling acts to storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the fare lands squarely in the mainstream of American culture -- what 
Mitze called "middle-of-the-road programming." The biggest reach may be the 
American Indian Dance Theatre, which will present a single show in February. Or 
perhaps, the local rock group "majority DOG". 
</P>
<P>
 But as soon as the theaters start earning solid profits, and the endowment 
fund begins churning out regular payments, Mitze hopes to book more eclectic 
entertainment -- opera, modern dance, a festival of 20th Century music. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have the money to sponsor shows that are more artistic or cultural, 
and less box-office oriented," he said. "But we'll walk before we run." 
</P>
<P>
 Proudly describing the spectacular ticket sales and speedy sell-outs, Mitze 
added: "We're not being experimental now, because we want to get all our groups 
going here, and start building an audience for the future. We need to put this 
place on the cultural map first. Then there will be time to start taking 
artistic risks." 
</P>

STUDENTS STAGE WALKOUT IN PROTEST OF PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO and MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoisting a Mexican flag and chanting "No on 187!" about 220 students staged a 
walkout from Rio Mesa High School on Friday morning and marched several miles 
toward Oxnard High, intent on persuading more students to leave school and join 
their protest. 
</P>
<P>
 But the marchers, opposing a ballot measure that would bar illegal immigrants 
from the classroom, were stopped a block from their destination by police, 
school officials, and a barricade of empty yellows buses. 
</P>
<P>
 The students then retreated to Plaza Park in downtown Oxnard, where they were 
ushered by police onto the school buses and taken back to the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The march against Proposition 187 was generally peaceful, police said, though 
a few students threw rocks at passing cars, and many ripped election signs from 
the streets as they walked by, converting them into protest posters. 
</P>
<P>
 Too young to vote, the students said they were expressing their opinion on the 
controversial ballot measure the only way they could. "Most of our friends and 
family are undocumented people," said 15-year-old Rosie Collazo as she marched 
down Central Avenue. "Maybe we're a bunch of high school students, but we know 
what we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 About 62% of Rio Mesa's 2,200 students are Latino, many of them from Oxnard 
neighborhoods heavily populated by immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Word of a walkout had been spreading around the high school for several days 
when at 9 a.m. Friday, students began milling around the school courtyard 
instead of going to their second class. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bell rung," 15-year-old Thelma Valenzuela said. "Nobody went to class. 
Everybody started saying 'Mexico! Mexico!"'  
</P>
<P>
 School officials, who had received reports late Thursday that students were 
plotting to march off campus, planned to herd students into the school 
cafeteria, where microphones and loudspeakers were set up to hold an 
anti-Proposition 187 rally. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to ensure that it was a peaceful demonstration," Oxnard Union High 
School District Supt. Bill Studt said. "But some students were not satisfied 
with just venting their frustrations on school grounds." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Students said that when school officials refused to open the gates, they 
started scaling the tall chain-link fences surrounding the school. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 students hopped over the fences and marched away, Studt said. 
Fearing that other students would injure themselves jumping the fence, school 
officials opened a gate, and another 200 joined the march, Studt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies arrived shortly afterward, but instead of ordering the 
students back to school, they told them they could hold a march as long as it 
was orderly. 
</P>
<P>
 About 75 students returned to school anyway, Studt said. Most of the students 
at the high school never left school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters marched down Central Avenue while deputies drove alongside, 
keeping the youths on the road's shoulder. Several cars honked in agreement and 
waved, drawing cheers from the jubilant students. 
</P>
<P>
 When the marchers drew near Oxnard High, they were met by Oxnard Police, a 
barricade of buses, and a group of school officials with bullhorns who asked 
them to board the buses back to Rio Mesa High because they had accomplished 
their goal. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials, worried that students at Oxnard High would join the march, 
asked police to detain the protesters before they reached school grounds. Both 
schools are within the district. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "You guys are destroying the educational environment," said Mike Hernandez, 
principal of the nearby Oxnard Adult School. 
</P>
<P>
 Student leaders marching with the crowd pleaded with their peers to return to 
school, but were not persuasive. The protesters answered with a chant of "Hell 
no, we won't go," and quickly bolted to nearby Plaza Park, where they were 
surrounded by police and empty school buses. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials decided at the park that they could not take the students 
back to Rio Mesa High, because another, larger protest was possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided at that point to take them to their bus stops," Studt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most protesters walked onto the buses without struggle, but a handful of 
students had to be pushed and dragged inside. 
</P>
<P>
 All the students who jumped the fence will probably be suspended from school 
or punished with detention, Studt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've (videotaped) those kids jumping over the fence," Studt said, "and once 
we ID those kids, we're going to take appropriate action." 
</P>
<P>
 Christina Guerrera, one of the student leaders who pleaded with protesters to 
board the buses, was not concerned about getting in trouble for the march. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could put me in Juvenile Hall for all I care," said Guerrera, 14, 
walking barefoot because her shoes were torn during the march. "I made my 
point."

FIRE DESTROYS OXNARD HANGAR, 12 AIRCRAFT; EMERGENCY: PRE-DAWN BLAZE AT 
32,000-SQUARE-FOOT STRUCTURE MELTS THE BUILDING'S CONTENTS INTO AN 
UNRECOGNIZABLE MASS OF METAL. 
</P>

<P>
 Fire swept through a hangar at the Oxnard Airport early Friday, melting a 
dozen planes and setting off a succession of fireballs that rocked the 
neighborhood and turned the pre-dawn sky bright red. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4:24 a.m. blaze, which gutted the 32,000-square-foot hangar at 1601 W. 5th 
St. in Oxnard, caused an estimated $3.5 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's flat, completely gone," Oxnard fire spokesman Bill Scobey said of the 
metal hangar, which was crumpled and still smoldering hours after the fire was 
extinguished.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the cause of the fire was not immediately known, inspectors said 
Friday afternoon they suspect that a pile of oil-soaked rags may have 
spontaneously combusted. 
</P>
<P>
 But inspectors said that is only one of many possibilities and that it could 
take days or even weeks to determine the cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Planes, including two early-morning commercial flights, took off and landed 
Friday without interruption. But police closed 5th Street between Victoria 
Avenue and Ventura Road to traffic until shortly after 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The hangar is owned by Ventura County and leased to Venco Pacific Aviation, 
which rented space to private plane owners and ran a maintenance and aviation 
operation. A computer consultant and an accountant also had offices in the 
hangar. 
</P>
<P>
 Venco is owned by Jim Schoenneman of Agoura Hills, who could not be reached 
for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A security officer was the first to see the blaze, which began in the 
northeast corner of the old hangar, built in the early 1940s out of wood beams 
and sheet metal. The guard tried to put the flames out but decided to call 
firefighters when he heard explosions, said Michael Musca, the administrative 
officer for the county Department of Airports. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time firefighters arrived, Scobey said, the blaze was racing across the 
200-foot-long building. 
</P>
<P>
 As firefighters battled the blaze, soot and charred metal rained on an 
apartment complex across the street from the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Apartment residents, crowded in a nearby parking lot and cloaked in blankets 
to fend off the morning cold, said they feared that the wood-shingle roofs on 
their units would catch fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen anything like it before," said Connie Williams, who said she 
and her children were awakened by a series of explosions. "All this stuff was 
flying through the air. The whole sky was filled with sparks." 
</P>
<P>
 As explosions ripped through the hangar, panicked residents went door-to-door 
waking their neighbors. Some fled their homes in nightgowns and pajamas. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' 18-year-old son, Joe, said there were about a dozen explosions -- 
caused by gas tanks and other fuel sources -- in about a half-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw big fireballs in the sky," he said. "The sky was totally red." 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was so intense that it melted everything inside the hangar, including 
the 12 planes, into an unrecognizable mass of metal. One of the planes, a 
Mitsubishi turboprop, was valued at $700,000, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep the fire from spreading, firefighters stationed themselves between the 
hangar and an office building to the east. In addition, firefighters guarded a 
smaller hangar to the west. 
</P>
<P>
 Flames came within a few feet of the smaller hangar, owned by Aero-Flite Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did a great job of saving this one," said Dan Phillips, owner of the 
55-year-old family aviation operation. "If this had gone, the whole row of 
hangars would have gone." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Scobey said 61 firefighters from the Oxnard and Ventura County fire 
departments took about 1 1/2 hours to put out the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 West of the blackened hangar, the heat from the fire blistered the paint of 
two small airplanes parked nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after the flames were extinguished, hot spots continued to rekindle.  
</P>
<P>
 About 10 a.m., the rubble cooled enough so inspectors could make their first 
walk through what was left of the building. But they warned that determining a 
cause will be difficult because of the intensity of the blaze and the 
destruction it left in its wake. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County's arson task force was called to help out in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've eliminated nothing, and we suspect everything," Oxnard fire inspector 
Richard Rodriguez said. "But it's going to be a monumental task. There's so 
much damage and it was such a big fire, there are just a lot of things to look 
at." 
</P>
<P>
 Airport Administrator Rod Murphy said Friday's blaze was the first major fire 
at Oxnard Airport. He noted that the county is just starting to put together a 
master plan to guide future uses for the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the county is insured for the $1.5-million loss of the hangar. 
</P>
<P>
 "The business operators and those who stored their planes in the hangar are 
the ones who really suffer most," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura resident Don McGunigale is among them. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past three years, he has run his computer consultant business out of 
the hangar. He lost computers and other items with an estimated value of about 
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like a bomb went off in there," McGunigale said. "You can't even 
tell there used to be airplanes in there. The totality of it being gone is just 
overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
 As firefighters began picking through the rubble late Friday morning, Ojai 
resident Ray Mason looked on in disbelief. Inside, somewhere in the charred 
beams and twisted sheet metal, was his 1959 Beechcraft Bonanza. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's totally gone, it's melted," he said, surveying the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Mason has been renting space in the hangar for four years. He said he had 
upgraded his plane over the years, pouring more than $75,000 into the flying 
machine. He even kept a scrapbook tracking its progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people have had losses, and I'm sure they all feel like I do," said 
Mason, a pilot of 42 years. "I don't know if I even want to start over."

CAMARILLO RESIDENTS TO CELEBRATE 30TH YEAR OF CITYHOOD WITH BARBECUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of Camarillo residents are expected to celebrate the city's 30th 
birthday today at a bash at Los Primeros School. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is being held to commemorate the city's incorporation Oct. 22, 1964, 
but there will be no formal speeches or displays of memorabilia. Instead, a 
quieter, more low-key event is planned, said city spokeswoman Chris Sanborn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted this to be just a nice, fun family kind of event," Sanborn said. 
"We have intentionally tried to emphasize the fun and de-emphasize the history 
and politics." 
</P>
<P>
 On tap for the afternoon event will be a tri-tip barbecue with all of the 
trimmings. Hot dogs and soft drinks also will be available, Sanborn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo City Councilwoman Charlotte Craven will co-host the party with 
Councilman Stan Daily at the elementary school at 2222 E. Ventura Blvd. The 
celebration is scheduled to begin at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The $4.50 advance admission price includes a complete tri-tip dinner. A 
limited number of $6 tickets will be available at the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Craven said the city decided to commemorate the anniversary with a 
family-oriented event. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a milestone," Craven said. "We have come a long way as a city, and we 
all should be proud of our accomplishments. But, because it's not a big 
anniversary like a 25th or a 50th, we wanted to keep it low-key." 
</P>
<P>
 The only official event will be a cake-cutting, led by Mayor Ken Gose and the 
rest of the City Council, at 6 p.m. in the school's auditorium. The three-tier 
confection was donated for the event by a local bakery. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Bill Little said the event is designed to be easy on the 
pocketbook, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aside from the admission price, everything else will be free to the public -- 
birthday cake, music and city shuttle buses," Little said. "We want this to be 
an occasion where everyone in the community can participate." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanborn said the Camarillo Community Band will offer musical selections 
throughout the afternoon until 6:30 p.m., when a disc jockey will play recorded 
'60s dance music. A local dance group, "Fresh Chances for America," also will 
perform throughout the day. The party is scheduled to conclude at 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Party-goers also will be able to view a display of vintage cars -- all 
manufactured in 1964 and owned by Camarillo residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of limited parking at the Ventura Boulevard school, the city will 
shuttle party-goers to and from the event from three parking areas around the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 The free buses will run every 15 minutes from the Camarillo Metrolink Station 
on Lewis Road at Ventura Boulevard, the Ponderosa Shopping Center and the 
Carmen Plaza shopping center. The bus service is scheduled to start at 3 p.m. 
and end at 10 p.m., Sanborn said. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo's 30th birthday celebration will be held today starting at 4 p.m. on 
the grounds of Los Primeros School, 2222 Ventura Blvd. Tickets are $4.50 in 
advance and $6 at the door.

JAPAN RULES OUT COUNTYWIDE CROP EMBARGO; MEDFLY: THE QUARANTINE ZONE IS SEEN AS 
A SUFFICIENT SAFEGUARD. EVEN WITHOUT A BLANKET BAN ON LOCAL FRUIT, OFFICIALS 
SAY THE INFESTATION WILL BE COSTLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To the immense relief of Ventura County's agricultural community, officials 
announced Friday that Japan has decided not to impose a countywide embargo on 
locally grown citrus, avocados and other crops because of the Medfly 
infestation in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese government has decided that the 86-square-mile quarantine area 
imposed by state, federal and county officials after the infestation was 
discovered is a sufficient safeguard for keeping the pest out of Japan, 
Agricultural Commissioner Earl McPhail announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Friday's announcement, growers had feared that Japan might decide to 
impose a countywide, or even statewide, embargo instead of accepting the 
current quarantine area. Japan annually imports about $200 million worth of 
Ventura County's produce. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very, very pleased that the Japanese have thought enough of our 
quarantine and methods of eradication to take our fruit," said Randy Axell, a 
Santa Paula farmer with 100 acres of oranges, lemons and avocados. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they hadn't purchased fruit from our county, it would have devastated the 
lemon economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Even without a blanket ban by the Japanese, agricultural officials said the 
the 3-week-old Mediterranean fruit fly infestation will still prove costly for 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers inside the 86-square-mile quarantine zone -- which includes some of 
the region's most fertile cropland -- could lose up to $50 million if forced to 
sell their produce domestically, McPhail said. Produce typically commands much 
higher prices in the Asian markets than at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, agricultural officials warned that the specter of a countywide Japanese 
ban still looms if the crop-eating flies are trapped outside the quarantine's 
center. So far, 63 Medflies have been trapped, all but one within a 
one-square-mile area of the original site east of Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been in a sprint the last 2 1/2 weeks, but the eradication effort is 
really a marathon and we've got a long way to go," said Rex Laird, executive 
director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau. "Any indication to Japan we've lost 
control of it and this whole thing could be set aside." 
</P>
<P>
 A visit to Ventura County by members of Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, 
Forestry and Fisheries proved to be a critical factor in the decision not to 
ban all of the county's produce, McPhail said. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the fact-finding mission last week, the three-member delegation 
toured the infestation area and flew in a helicopter as a trio of other 
choppers sprayed malathion and corn syrup over Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 McPhail said the Japanese were impressed with the quickness of the state's 
decision to move forward with aerial spraying and were reassured by the 
isolation of the infestation area.  
</P>
<P>
 During daytime flyovers of western Ventura County, the Japanese delegation was 
able to see that South Mountain provides a natural barrier between the 
quarantine zone and the rich farmland in the Santa Clara River valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all showed them we care very deeply about this situation and we all want 
to get it eradicated as soon as we can," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure that the infestation does not spread, county officials plan to hang 
additional traps this week in a one-mile belt outside the core area at St. 
John's Seminary. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, about 1,200 traps are scattered throughout the quarantine area. But 
no Medflies have been found since Oct. 6, said Doug Hendrix, spokesman for the 
state and federal Cooperative Medfly Project. 
</P>
<P>
 If Japan had banned all host products grown in Ventura County, the 
agricultural industry would have lost more than the $200 million in Japanese 
exports, McPhail said. Boycotts by other foreign nations could have cost the 
county another $100 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laird added that the county's major crops would have flooded the domestic 
market, causing prices to plunge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd have lost our shirt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 William Quarles, vice president of the citrus cooperative Sunkist Growers, 
said a total ban on Ventura County would have resulted in a 30% oversupply to 
the domestic citrus market. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is just enough to submerge the market," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As it stands now, growers and shippers say they will try to minimize the 
impact by sending pesticide-treated fruit in the quarantine zone to domestic 
markets and filling Japanese orders with crops grown elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry officials also hope other countries will follow Japan's lead in 
accepting produce from the rest of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan, Australia and New Zealand -- Ventura County's biggest foreign markets 
after Japan -- currently have restrictions banning the import of fruit grown 
within 30- to 50-miles of a quarantine perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would expect the other markets in the Pacific Rim to follow Japan's lead," 
Quarles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Growers in the Camarillo area said they hope the quarantine will be lifted 
before the last spring and summer months, when the bulk of the citrus is 
shipped overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 "With any luck and a little good weather . . . we could have an average year," 
said Don Reeder, operations supervisor of Pro-Ag Inc., which manages 2,000 
acres of farmland, half of which is inside the restricted area. Medlfy 
Quarantine nd Eradication Areas 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County's agricultural officials announced Friday that Japan will not 
place a countywide embargo on citrus, avocados and other produce considered a 
host to the Medfly. The Japanese government will ban only crops grown with the 
86-square-mile quarantine zone. Source: State Department of Food and

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUTH-CENTRAL; U.S. 
GIVES CITY $7 MILLION TO TRAIN UNSKILLED WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) said the city has secured a five-year, 
$7-million federal grant to help train unskilled workers between the ages of 17 
and 30 in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department funding, which will include a first-year allocation of $3 
million, will be channeled through Community Build, a coalition that Waters 
founded in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "This program will create opportunities for young people to enroll in school, 
get jobs and have a chance for a decent quality of life," Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Program participants will receive a monthly stipend of up to $100 to help with 
transportation, food and incidental costs. A case manager also will be assigned 
to each participant to monitor his or her progress.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; BATTLE OVER STREET REACHES CITY CLERK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The battle between Ventura residents fighting to reopen Poli Street at Ventura 
High School and those who want to keep it closed spilled over into the city 
clerk's office this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The group working to defeat Measure E, which would reopen the street, noticed 
that opponents had given neither their organization's name nor its address in 
campaign literature, which is a violation of the state elections code. 
</P>
<P>
 In a mailing to 1,000 absentee voters, Concerned Citizens of Ventura put only 
the initials "CCV" above the return addresses on its envelopes. 
</P>
<P>
 And the enclosed pamphlets fail to list even the initials of the group's name 
or its address. The mailing also included a cover letter that fully identified 
the group. 
</P>
<P>
 After anti-Measure E forces gave copies of the literature to City Clerk 
Barbara Kam, she informed Concerned Citizens of Ventura President David 
Gladstone that all campaign literature should identify the sender's name on the 
outside envelopes. Groups must also give their names and addresses on any 
pamphlets they distribute by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Gladstone said the omissions were a mistake. "It was an oversight," he said, 
adding that the organization is reprinting flyers to include the missing 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura High parent Valerie Chrisman, who heads the anti-Measure E group 
known as Poli: Safety Over Convenience, said Concerned Citizens' failure to 
identify itself was deliberate. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure E opponents are upset, Chrisman said, because Gladstone's group is 
using the Ventura High School colors gold and black in its literature, which 
she said wrongly implies school support for the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Gladstone, however, said his organization picked the high school's colors 
because the issue is about Ventura High. MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; PROTESTS OVER SALES AT LIQUOR STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Chanting "Stop breaking the law!" about 30 students, community activists and 
Ventura County officials protested an Oxnard liquor store that has been cited 
repeatedly for selling alcohol to minors for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alcohol is destroying our youth," said Felipe Santana, director of community 
services for the county Alcohol and Drug Programs."We cannot tolerate that in 
Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control is trying to revoke the 
license of the Stop N' Save Market, 1037 S. Ventura Road, after an 
investigation uncovered numerous violations, said Ed Macias, supervisor of the 
local departmental office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a hearing Monday to revoke the license," Macias said outside the 
store. "Apparently they didn't think they needed to make an appearance." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynrose Dimalanta, the store's owner, has been cited a dozen or more times 
since February for selling liquor to minors, authorities said. Before that, her 
father, T. Roman Paras, was cited nine times for the same offense, Macias said. 
</P>
<P>
 Store workers shut the door and would not comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC officials were trying to revoke Paras' license when he canceled it. His 
daughter then obtained a permit to sell alcohol at the same store. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogelio Boteoo, a 17-year old student at Ventura College, said the store was 
well-known to teen-agers as a place where they could buy booze. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knows about it, that they can walk in and buy it here," he said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; CABLE FIRM SAYS TAPE OF CANDIDATES STOLEN 
</P>

<P>
 Oxnard City Council candidates, each believing they had outshined the others 
in a recent candidates' forum, were upset when they heard the news: Someone 
stole the videotape of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones Intercable, Oxnard's cable provider, taped last month's forum and 
planned to televise it eight times before the Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 But when workers looked for the tape shortly after the event, it was gone. The 
company is treating it as a theft. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tapes don't disappear around here," said Jeff Jones, the cable company's 
general manager. "We turned the place upside down. It's not here." 
</P>
<P>
 After questioning employees and frantically searching their studios, 
management at Jones Intercable notified police of the caper earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm awfully disappointed that something like this could happen right here in 
Oxnard over a City Council race," Jones said. "I guess I'm a bit naive." 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Tom Holden, who said he performed well in the forum, called for a 
full investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should get to the bottom of this," Holden said, "because this is 
ridiculous. . . . We were frustrated that something of this nature could 
happen, that the voters weren't going to see it." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Oxnard Police Chief Tom Cady said he had not heard any report of a 
stolen tape, but was curious to learn more about the disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate Dean Maulhardt said he could not understand why anyone would steal 
the tape, since the forum had been a rather stale affair. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't got it," Maulhardt said jokingly. "We have been looking for it on 
television." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones Intercable sent letters Friday to all the candidates who participated in 
the forum, apologizing and asking them if they would attend another forum Oct. 
29 so the cable company could tape it. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

 Visitors appreciate "the educational side" of the exhibit, marketing director 
Mark Edwards told the Reuters news agency. "Most people had only seen O.J. on

'Oh, is that what he looks like? Is that how tall he is?' "

 He added: "We thought about having models of O.J.'s attorneys and the

 A round-trip bare: The New York Transit Authority recently ruled that women,

</P>
<P>
 Here, in more sophisticated L.A., no one has been ticketed for riding topless.

is "nothing about shirts, shoes, shorts or culottes."

 However, the MTA does say no to "smoking, littering, eating, drinking, or

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY 
COUNCIL OKS 2% RAISE FOR DEPARTMENT MANAGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council approved a 2% salary increase for department 
general managers, matching the raises most other city workers got earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 But agency chiefs will not automatically receive the 2% raise that other 
workers get next year. Mayor Richard Riordan and the council are considering 
modifications in the merit pay plan for general managers. The council also 
approved a 9% raise over three years for some managers and non-union employees 
of the Department of Water and Power. Union workers won a 9% raise after 
striking last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The salary package approved today covers 1,100 full-time and 7,100 part- time 
employees but excludes DWP managers who earn more than $70,000 a year.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; SUSPECTS' FATE RESTS ON CAUSE OF DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fate of two murder suspects hinges on the determination of cause of death 
for a Ventura man who died one day after being beaten and robbed of $15. 
</P>
<P>
 As trial began Thursday, Deputy Dist. Atty.Terence M. Kilbride said Thomas 
Shoop suffered a ruptured spleen because he was kicked repeatedly by Everado 
Mondragon and Jose Sanchez when they robbed him Feb. 20 in the Ventura Avenue 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Mondragon, 35, and Sanchez, 24, say Shoop suffered the injury 
several hours later, when he fell in his bathroom while drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 The question will be decided by Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr., 
who is hearing the trial without a jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondragon and Sanchez, who have pleaded not guilty, are charged with 
first-degree murder and robbery. Kilbride said Shoop called police after he was 
robbed and later identified the defendants as the ones who stole his $15. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoop declined medical treatment at that time and again in the early morning 
hours of Feb. 21, when he complained of pain. 
</P>
<P>
 His roommate, Richard Graham, told police he heard a loud noise in the 
bathroom that night but did not investigate. He later found a broken toilet 
seat in the bathroom and fecal matter smeared on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham said he left Shoop in his apartment about 6 a.m. on Feb. 21. A 
door-to-door solicitor found Shoop dead in the residence about 12 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Charles Cassy, who represents Sanchez, said he will contest 
the cause of the injury that killed Shoop. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really can't say for a medical certainty" what caused the injury, Cassy 
said. "The victim got very, very drunk, fell down in the bathroom and broke the 
toilet seat." BARBARA MURPHY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; FUND RAISING SLATED FOR LIBRARIES TODAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Supporters of the Ventura libraries will conduct a survey and a fund-raising 
campaign to "make a difference" for the city's troubled libraries today, 
national Make a Difference Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Girl Scouts and library volunteers hope to distribute about 10,000 of the 
single-page questionnaires at seven stores and shopping centers, said Trish 
Cavanaugh, community relations manager for the County Library Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Cavanaugh said donations received at the canvassing sites will go directly 
toward expanding library hours at one of the city's four branches. She said 
answers to the surveys will be compiled and used to influence decisions about 
library hours and locations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will make a difference in terms of the library services they 
eventually receive," Cavanaugh said. 
</P>
<P>
 The system has lost 45% of its funding in the past two years, and hours in 
Ventura have dropped from 158 per week in 1992 to 67 in 1994, spread among the 
four sites, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey asks residents if they support: consolidating the Foster and Wright 
libraries; seeking additional city, county, or state funding, and building a 
replacement for the Foster library, which the survey describes as "outdated, 
small and crowded." 
</P>
<P>
 Make a Difference Day, chaired by actor Paul Newman, is a national community 
service effort. IRA E. STOLL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; EX-COLLEGE EMPLOYEE FIGHTING HER FIRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The former manager of the Oxnard College bookstore is challenging the 
trustees' decision to fire her last summer, claiming she was never given a 
chance to improve her record-keeping after a damaging audit. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Davies took her grievance to the Ventura County Community College 
District, which held an administrative hearing before the personnel commission 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Such administrative hearings must be held at the district level before a 
wrongful termination lawsuit can be filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Davies' attorney, David Bernstein of Beverly Hills, told commissioners that 
district officials made a scapegoat of his client for bookstore losses, which 
amounted to at least $40,000 over a six-month period. 
</P>
<P>
 "The punishment does not fit the crime," Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart W. Rudnick, who represents the college district in the proceeding, said 
Davies was fired simply because she was not doing the job she was hired to 
perform. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ms. Davies was operating a million-dollar-a-year business out of a shoe box 
and not doing it very well," Rudnick said. "There was no way of knowing if all 
the money that was supposed to be in the register was there." 
</P>
<P>
 An independent audit of the Oxnard College bookstore conducted earlier this 
year turned up numerous record-keeping discrepancies and losses of more than 
$40,000 for the last six months of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees decided to fire Davies on the recommendation of college President 
Elise D. Schneider following a closed-door meeting in June. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; DROWNING VICTIM WAS BURGLARY SUSPECT

<P>
 A pre-dawn prowler who drowned off the Ventura Pier after fleeing from police 
was identified Friday as a transient being sought in connection with up to 15 
nighttime burglaries while residents were home, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 36-year-old man, whose identity was withheld until relatives could be 
reached, ran into the sea after a foot pursuit by officers that began at 3:12 
a.m. Thursday in the parking structure at the Country Inn on South Chestnut 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Divers found his body about 4 p.m. Thursday, his bulky clothing snagged on the 
barnacles along the pier pilings about 10 feet down, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been looking for this guy for some time (for questioning)," Ventura 
Police Sgt. Gary McCaskill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Sean Conroy, who has tallied up to 15 similar burglaries in the 
mid-Ventura area around Main Street and East Thompson Boulevard, said a prowler 
has been slipping into residents' homes while they were home. The prowler has 
then snatched up available items such as purses and jewelry before fleeing, 
Conroy said. GREG RIPPEE

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: TORRANCE; 2 ARRESTED IN 
7 HOLDUPS AFTER 2-DAY SURVEILLANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After following the suspects for two days, Torrance detectives arrested two 
men believed to be responsible for seven street robberies and automated teller 
machine holdups in Torrance during the last week. The arrests Thursday came 
moments after the suspects allegedly robbed a 22-year-old Whittier man at an 
ATM in the 2900 block of West Street in Pico Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrested on suspicion of robbery were Orlando Marcus Haygood, 20, and a 
15-year-old male juvenile, both of Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 According to Torrance police, the suspected robbers approached their victims 
at ATMs, gas stations and restaurant parking lots, drawing handguns and 
demanding cash, jewelry and telephone pagers. Based on a description of a 
getaway car, detectives identified the suspects and kept them under 
surveillance until they allegedly robbed the Whittier man.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; LEAD 
WARNING ISSUED FOR MEXICAN LOLLIPOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State and county health officials are working to keep a brand of Mexican 
lollipops that may contain toxic lead levels off store shelves, according to 
state Health Director Kim Belshey. 
</P>
<P>
 Vero Rebanaditos, Vero Mango and Vero Elotes are all dark brown, walnut-size 
"suckers" and are wrapped in clear, red and yellow cellophane.They are found 
primarily in stores that serve Latino communities, Belshey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials believe one child already has been poisoned by the lead in some of 
the lollipops, Belshey said, adding that the candy's wrappers could be just as 
toxic. 
</P>
<P>
 Lead is poisonous to people, especially infants and small children, and can 
permanently damage the central nervous system, resulting in learning 
deficiencies and other long-term health problems, Belshey said.  
</P>
<P>
 Pregnant women who consume lead may harm their unborn children, Belshey said.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; OFFICE FOR MOBILE CRISIS TEAM 
APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks officials have approved plans to establish an east Ventura 
County headquarters for a mobile mental health crisis team. 
</P>
<P>
 The new office, approved by the City Council on Tuesday night, will allow 
mental health experts to respond more quickly to emergencies in Thousand Oaks, 
Moorpark and Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The team, which is called in to defuse potentially violent situations, such as 
suicide attempts and spousal disputes, will be based at the East Valley 
Sheriff's Station on Olsen Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobile crisis team supervisor Mary Randall said the new location would allow 
the team to respond to incidents in progress in all three cities in the east 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, coming from Ventura, it can take us 45 minutes to an hour to 
respond to an emergency," Randall said. "That obviously is not very good for 
anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Randall said there has been a need for mobile crisis services in Thousand 
Oaks, Moorpark and Simi Valley since the east county unit was cut eight years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The team will operate rent free from the city-owned Olsen Road station, which 
is in Thousand Oaks. In exchange for the space, the Ventura County mental 
health department agreed to pay about $10,000 for necessary renovations to the 
sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks officials praised the agreement and said the crisis services 
will be an important addition to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very creative approach to filling a need for the people of Thousand 
Oaks," Councilwoman Elois Zeanah said. Randall said she expected the mobile 
unit to be up and running early next year. MATTHEW MOSK

COMMUTER CHILD-CARE CENTER TO BE UNVEILED; TRANSIT: METROLINK WILL OPEN 
FACILITY AT SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY STATION MONDAY. ANOTHER WILL BE BUILT AS PART 
OF A COURT ORDER TO SERVE CENTURY FREEWAY USERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK B. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Working parents frustrated by the twin rituals of child care and commuting 
will soon find relief -- next to a freeway and at a train station. 
</P>
<P>
 What is billed as the first child-care center ever built at a train station 
will open Monday at the Metrolink station in the San Bernardino County 
community of Montclair, to be followed by two more in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 And residents who live along the Century Freeway will have a place to drop off 
their children next summer when a child-care center is built near the freeway 
in Willowbrook as an offshoot of the freeway construction program. It will open 
about the same time that the Green Line light-rail system begins running down 
the middle of the freeway from Norwalk to El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 The child-care center at the Montclair station -- named Kids' Station -- is 
one of three that Metrolink plans to open in the next two years. The others 
will be at the Chatsworth and Sylmar/San Fernando stations. Both are being 
built by Metrolink, a five-county agency that operates commuter trains, with 
funding from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to encourage people to car-pool," Metrolink spokesman Peter Hidalgo 
said. "This new center eliminates the trips back and forth from day care to 
stations. Convenience is what commuters want." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the Century Freeway Housing Program, which oversees the 
building of housing for residents displaced by freeway construction, say they 
are close to finalizing plans to build a child-care center. 
</P>
<P>
 The program -- established by a court order -- has set aside $2.5 million in 
state and federal transit funds for the center, which will serve 70 to 100 
children. Priority will be given to residents of 2,700 low-income housing units 
built to replace units lost because of the freeway construction and passengers 
riding the Green Line light-rail system, located down the middle of the 
freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Century Freeway child-care center is the latest addition in a special 
package of amenities, including housing and job opportunities, aimed at 
residents in the path of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1981 federal court consent decree, state highway officials pledged to 
deal with the needs of displaced residents. They also agreed that 35% of the 
contractors hired would be female and minority contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 The $2.5-billion Century Freeway, the most expensive freeway in the nation's 
history, has been the subject of much scrutiny and controversy. Its vast budget 
and contracting problems caused Caltrans officials and housing administrators 
to reassess the handling of finances and freeway construction. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last three years, federal appeals court Judge Harry Pregerson, who 
monitors the consent decree, has been working with Caltrans, the Century 
Freeway Housing Program and the MTA to develop the child-care center. They say 
the center will be important to residents of Lynwood and Compton, as well as 
residents of low-income housing built to replace units destroyed during freeway 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The child-care center will offer not only child care, but workshops on 
parenting skills and job training. 
</P>
<P>
 Pregerson, who has overseen the Century Freeway case since residents first 
filed suit to protest the impact of the project in 1972, said he has been 
working for years to make child-care centers a part of city transit planning.

A LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS; LAW ENFORCEMENT: FIRST OF FIVE HIGH-TECH NIGHT VISION 
ENHANCERS IS DONATED TO LAPD. DEVICES ARE EXPECTED TO AID SURVEILLANCE, RESCUE 
OPERATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For decades, darkness has been a faithful accomplice to the gang members on 
Blythe Street in Panorama City, cloaking their drug deals and drive-by 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Friday, Los Angeles police acquired the ability to pierce the veil with 
a new, high-tech weapon developed for a battlefield of a different sort. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of five "Night Enforcer 250" night vision scopes -- utilizing the 
same technology widely employed by the military in Operation Desert Storm and 
elsewhere in recent years -- was donated to the LAPD by ITT Gilfillan of Van 
Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the problems has been that (gang members) have seen us before we see 
them," said police Capt. James McMurray, of the LAPD's Van Nuys Division, who 
received the first scope. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we just changed the balance." 
</P>
<P>
 Allowing for observation in near-total darkness, the scopes have been used for 
police work throughout the country. Last summer a pair was used by the 
Devonshire Division to track and capture a pair of suspected rapists in 
Chatsworth Park. 
</P>
<P>
 But the donation to the Van Nuys Division marks a new effort to phase these 
devices into the everyday arsenal of local law enforcement.  
</P>
<P>
 Over the next month, four more units will be donated to Los Angeles area law 
enforcement agencies, including at least two more to the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the devices give an obvious surveillance advantage to undercover vice 
officers, beat officers also hope they will help protect the lives of those 
chasing suspects at night or performing search-and-rescue operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The 26-ounce scope converts available dim light -- such as starlight -- into 
electrical energy, boosts it electronically and then converts the energy into 
ghostly greenish-white images. Using the scope, a 6-foot-tall man could be 
spotted on a moonless night at a distance of 125 yards, the manufacturer says. 
</P>
<P>
 At a cost of $2,400 apiece, the night vision scopes have been widely used by 
the military -- including operations in Kuwait, Iraq, Grenada and Panama -- and 
only recently have been redesigned to meet the needs of local law enforcement.

PROP. 187 WOULD CUT 10,000 TEACHING JOBS, OFFICIALS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified School District officials predicted Friday that 10,000 
teachers would lose their jobs and some campuses would be closed if Proposition 
187 passes and is enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Education President Mark Slavkin warned that all schools and students 
would be affected by the initiative and that the system stands to lose up to 
$628 million in federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very real for all students," Slavkin said. "Citizen children . . . 
will be hurt by a loss of funds. There is no surplus, no savings, no extra 
money generated for schools to use." 
</P>
<P>
 Although officials said they are unsure how many of the district's 636,400 
students are undocumented, Slavkin said the number could be as high as 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavkin said campuses on the Westside and in the San Fernando Valley would be 
likely targets for closure. Many of those schools receive Latino students bused 
from overcrowded campuses in heavily immigrant neighborhoods throughout the 
district. Officials did not know which campuses would be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Education has threatened to withhold federal funds from 
school districts if Proposition 187 is approved by voters Nov. 8 because the 
measure would require officials to violate federal privacy laws.  
</P>
<P>
 But an education department spokeswoman said Friday she does not know when the 
money would be withheld and that questions remain about how students' 
immigration status would be determined.

AL MARTINEZ: PRIDE AND PREJUDICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I returned from vacation last Sunday just in time to see 70,000 human beings 
march through the streets of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 What these human beings were marching for was to rally opposition to a ballot 
measure that is detrimental to other human beings. 
</P>
<P>
 The marchers hit the streets with pride and determination, an angry species on 
a small, blue planet 93 million miles from the sun, trying to make a point on a 
ball in space whose inhabitants are always in a stew about something. 
</P>
<P>
 The human beings were marching against a Proposition called 187 that's coming 
to a vote in a couple of weeks in a state called California that's part of the 
ball bouncing through the void. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposition is aimed at people who somehow cross an arbitrary line, a 
border, in order to, of course, get to the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 This angers some other human beings who don't want those from the other side 
of the line on their side of the line without getting approval. It's kind of 
like asking "Mother, may I?" before you cross. 
</P>
<P>
 I realize that seems kind of silly in a cosmic sense, since they're all part 
of the same species on the same planet and have a lot bigger things to worry 
about than lines on the ground, but that's the way it is. They're a primitive 
species. 
</P>
<P>
 To punish these human beings who cross the line without a mother-may-I, others 
have proposed the measure called 187, which, by the way, is the state's 
numerical designation for murder. It doesn't propose killing the Other-Siders, 
but it sure would make life unpleasant for them if it passes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Humans are good at making things miserable for one another. A quick trip 
through Earth's history shows they've been hanging, burning, shooting, 
crucifying, stabbing, bombing and generally mutilating each other since they 
crawled out of the swamps. 
</P>
<P>
 They've gone to war over race, religion, culture, language, food, oil, gold, 
water, pieces of paper and all those arbitrary lines they draw on the ground, 
and sometimes even on the water and in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 There's been enough hatred on that planet to fill hell, and every identifiable 
group in the race of human beings has felt its sting. 
</P>
<P>
 They killed 6 million of their own kind not too long ago, even children, for 
no reason; decent, loving, good people. And I can't escape the feeling they'd 
kill 6 million more of any kind at all if they had half the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 They're still not very far from the edge of the swamp, I guess; small 
creatures crawling angrily toward sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting back to the Proposition called 187, I'm not saying everyone who's for 
it is a hater or a killer. They're human beings who are worried and afraid 
about what's happening to their world. 
</P>
<P>
 It used to be humans had moments of tranquillity between wars when they could 
walk the streets and do their shopping and sit on a park bench without being 
shot down for the pennies in their pockets. It used to be they could get jobs 
easily and rest assured they'd keep them. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not true anymore and, just as they've always done, the humans are 
looking around for people to blame who, though members of the same species, 
aren't quite like them. So they look to the other side of the line. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I was impressed by the march last Sunday, but I'm an emotional kind of guy, 
easily moved when I see members of the same species celebrating their small 
differences by banding together for a common good. 
</P>
<P>
 So I took the time to talk to a lot of human beings who say they're going to 
vote for 187, even though it will keep kids from going to school and sick 
people from going to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 I was right about them. Some are haters, sure, and will tell you there are 
just too damned many Mexicans in L.A., but most are humans worried about what's 
happening to their little worlds. 
</P>
<P>
 They want to send a message to those on the other side of the line to stay 
there, to master their own destinies, so that both sides can prosper and 
everyone'll be happy. Separate but equal, kind of. 
</P>
<P>
 I worry too. I worry for all of us humans and what's going to happen not only 
to us, but to those around us we love so much. 
</P>
<P>
 But I'm going to tell you, one human being to another, that 187 isn't an 
answer to anything. The message is all wrong. It's mean and small-minded and 
punishes those most easily hurt, children and sick people. 
</P>
<P>
 I've tried to point this out in a cosmic sense, because maybe it's about time 
we stopped blaming people who cross lines and start looking around for 
solutions that will benefit every member of the human race. 
</P>
<P>
 When you stop to think about it, we may not be much, but we're all we've got. 
And we're all on one planet together.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: NEWBURY PARK; WIFE FACES TRIAL IN CAR-RAMMING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MURPHY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Newbury Park woman was ordered Friday to stand trial on an attempted murder 
charge even though her husband testified that she could not have seen him 
underneath a jacked-up car when she rammed it with her vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Court Judge Vincent J. O'Neill Jr. said much of the evidence 
presented at Marcia Burns' preliminary hearing was subject to two 
interpretations.But he was unable to "come up with a view of the incident that 
does not give me a reasonable suspicion that we have an attempted murder." 
</P>
<P>
 A trial date for Burns, 44, will be set Nov. 4. She remains in jail with bail 
set at $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Lee Burns, 41, testified that he does not want his wife prosecuted for 
the Sept. 23 incident, which occurred while he was repairing a car at his auto 
shop in Newbury Park. He suffered minor injuries to his shoulder and chest when 
the car fell on him. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives testified that witnesses heard Marcia Burns yell, "I hope you die," 
before and after the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Burns admitted he and the defendant had decided to separate, and had 
fought for months over which one would move out of their apartment. But in 
recounting the events before the car incident, he claimed not to remember much 
of the information he earlier had given to police. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill said Burns' lack of recall was unconvincing. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Public Defender Jean L. Farley said there is no evidence Marcia 
Burns intended to hurt her husband. But Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom Connors said no 
evidence was presented to show she had not rammed the car on purpose. BARBARA

 The global information revolution's effect on the future of business, 
government and everyday life will be the focus of a conference in Thousand Oaks 
on Thursday, featuring former Vice President Dan Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
 Quayle is slated to speak about freedom in the 21st Century. Rep. Robert T. 
Matsui (D-Sacramento) is scheduled to deliver a keynote address about trade in 
the 21st Century during the daylong conference at the new Civic Arts Plaza.

<P>
 An executive at the World Affairs Council of Ventura County said she hopes the 
"Passport to Tomorrow" conference will attract an international audience and 
bring economic benefits to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to expose people who are responsible for foreign trade all over 
the world to businesses that are located in Ventura County," said Cynthia 
Cooke, executive director of the council, which is sponsoring the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday morning sessions will focus on "doing business in the global 
information age." Afternoon panel discussions will explore electronic privacy 
and "making government work in the global information age." 
</P>
<P>
 The World Affairs Council is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization founded in 
1990 to promote awareness and discussion of national and international policy 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for the conference, which is open to the public, range from $95 to 
$175, with an extra charge for the Quayle and Matsui speeches. 
</P>

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; WAYS SOUGHT TO CUT CITY'S STREET TRAFFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Watching a steady stream of trucks along California 118 in Moorpark, 
Assemblyman Nao Takasugi got a firsthand look at the city's traffic woes. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the California Department of Transportation completed the Simi 
Valley-Moorpark Freeway connector last year, traffic on Moorpark's streets has 
increased by more than 30%, according to Sheriff's Department reports.Surveys 
show that traffic is up more than 10,000 truck and car trips a day on stretches 
of the road as it cuts through the city. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1992 survey by Larry Hail, a civil engineer working for a developer, counted 
a daily average of 27,000 vehicles along the highway between Moorpark Avenue 
and Spring Road. Another survey by Hail in January showed an average of 37,000 
vehicles a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the increased traffic is attributed to truckers avoiding the 
California Highway Patrol truck scales on the Conejo Grade, the Sheriff's 
Department said. Another reason given for the increase is that improvements on 
the 118 make it a faster route to Oxnard and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Takasugi came to Moorpark this week after hearing complaints about truck 
traffic. He met with city officials, a representative from the CHP and the head 
of the sheriff's traffic division to discuss solutions. The group then headed 
out to watch the traffic on the highway. 
</P>
<P>
 They discussed a range of ideas to cut traffic, including banning commercial 
trucks from the highway, Mayor Paul Lawrason said.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's not very possible," he said. "But we wanted to go through every 
possible solution." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrason said placement of a permanent truck inspection station at the edge of 
the city was also discussed.  
</P>
<P>
 Takasugi will tour the Conejo scales next week and discuss ways to prevent 
commercial trucks from avoiding the scales. SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; NEW SHOOTING RANGE OKD BY COMMISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After years of searching for a safe, remote spot for police and gun 
enthusiasts to practice shooting, the Simi Valley Planning Commission said 
Shooter's Paradise has hit the mark. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission approved on Wednesday night the Oxnard-based company's plan to 
open a 10,000-square-foot indoor firing range in an industrial section of west 
Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really been a long time coming," said Commissioner Michael Piper, who 
had been part of an earlier effort to find an outdoor site for target practice. 
"I'm looking forward to seeing this get off the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed shooting gallery received the unanimous support of the 
commissioners, after they settled minor concerns about where the business would 
store trash and how it would light its parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "These issues are really peanuts," Piper said. "The lighting has to do with 
safety, but I think the last place I'd want to cause trouble is a place where 
people have just come off a firing range, half of whom are police." 
</P>
<P>
 The most serious concern for neighbors -- the potential for noise -- was 
quickly handled by representatives from Shooter's Paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 The gun range would be encased in steel and would be virtually soundproof, 
said Steven Perlman, a company consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 Perlman said the range and retail store at 440 Easy St. would be clean and 
state-of-the-art. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials said they hoped to open the center in December for use seven 
days a week, after the industrial building undergoes about $400,000 in 
renovations. 
</P>
<P>
 When it opens, city officials said they expected to save an estimated $25,000 
a year in overtime and travel costs that it pays out to the Simi Valley Police 
Department. The department's 110 officers currently practice in ranges in 
Ventura and Camarillo. MATTHEW MOSK

LEADER OF MORMONS REAFFIRMS PRIMACY OF CHURCH TEACHINGS; INTERVIEW: AFTER BEING 
CHOSEN PRESIDENT AND PROPHET IN JUNE, HOWARD W. HUNTER REACHED OUT TO 
DISAFFECTED MEMBERS. BUT HE STILL UPHOLDS AUTHORITY OF THE HIERARCHY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If one thing has characterized the tenure of Howard W. Hunter as the new 
president and prophet of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, it 
has been his call to disaffected Mormons to return to the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "To those who have transgressed or offended, we say come back! To those who 
are hurt and struggling and afraid, we say let us stand with you and dry your 
tears," Hunter said in June after he was elected to the top post of the 
8.8-million-member church. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter, 86, is believed by Mormons to be God's living prophet on Earth, just 
as Moses was during biblical times. 
</P>
<P>
 For this reason, those who seek reforms within the church -- including the 
admission of women to the Mormon priesthood and greater freedom to question the 
doctrines of the church -- were cautiously optimistic when Hunter struck a 
chord of reconciliation. In the last several years leading up to Hunter's 
election, at least seven Mormons were excommunicated for publicly challenging 
church teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 in his first major interview since his election, Hunter, mild-mannered and 
gentle, was nonetheless unbending in reaffirming the primacy of the church's 
teachings over individual conscience, the authority of the hierarchy and the 
appropriateness of ecclesiastical sanctions against those who cross the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter spoke to Times Religion Writer Larry B. Stammer this week during a trip 
to Pasadena to meet with area Mormons. Following are excerpts from that 
interview: 
</P>
<P>
 Question: You beckoned those who have set themselves apart from the church to 
return home. How do you think this theme of reconciliation is being received by 
your flock? 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter: My observation is it's been received wholeheartedly. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you concerned, as some other church people are, about an erosion of 
moral purpose and of hierarchical authority? A lot of Catholics, for example, 
say they do not agree with this or that policy that comes from the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter: We have concern, yes. We have concern . . . that morals are being 
eroded among young people, particularly. We teach the principle that these 
things are wrong. Now when it comes to the matter of taking them up in the 
church, we do not have a split of opinion among the membership. We're united. 
The membership of the church . . . sustains and follows the teachings of those 
in authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there any concern that you need to very clearly draw a line now to avoid 
the controversy and disagreement that you might see in the Roman Catholic 
Church? Is it important to nip it in the bud? 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter: Yes. We follow it (dissent) carefully in the church. We attempt to set 
aside (differences) and be united entirely on matters which have been 
considered by the authorities of the church. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: As you know, some Catholic theologians have been barred from teaching in 
Catholic universities by the Pope because they departed from Catholic 
orthodoxy. (Mormons have imposed similar restrictions on Mormon theologians.) 
Where does academic freedom and freedom of inquiry cross the line into apostasy 
and how difficult is it to draw that line? 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter: That's a concern that's talked about within the leadership of the 
church. Now there are many who think they don't have academic freedom. In some 
sense that requires a definition of academic freedom. But where there is an 
outspoken opposition to that which has been announced by the church's policy, 
we take action on it. We think that is a matter which should be handled by a 
council . . . that handles judicial matters, that they (theologians or others) 
be in conformity with the teachings of the church. If they're not they'll be 
subject to disciplinary action -- and usually are. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: There have been occasions in the past when some churches have recanted 
certain teachings. Galileo comes to mind -- when the Roman Catholic Church 
hundreds of years later said it was wrong in punishing Galileo for saying the 
earth revolved around the sun. Is it possible in light of continuing revelation 
that the Mormon Church may change its opposition to women in the priesthood? 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter: At the present time there isn't an avenue of ever changing. It's too 
well defined by revelation, by Scripture. And we follow strictly the scriptural 
passageway in matters of that kind. I see nothing that will lead to a change of 
direction at the present time -- or in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: As prophet and seer of the church, do you see yourself as speaking 
infallibly? And how would you define infallible? 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter: That's an interesting question. I'll answer the first part. I would 
not presume to hold myself (personally) as infallible, except on matters that 
are clearly defined by Scripture and by revelations. When (infallible) things 
are defined, we feel that the answer is scriptural and scripturally placed. 
Then, we take a strong stand. As far as infallibility is concerned, the 
officers of the church and the Council of the Twelve will support the First 
Presidency (Hunter and two of his counselors) without question or difference of 
opinion. There would be one opinion. . . . There's a powerful unity in the 
leadership of the church that is followed without deviation by the membership. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you approach your tenure as president and prophet in view of your 
age and the condition of your health. Are you concerned? 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter: Yes, I'm concerned. Yet there is the longstanding chain of events that 
lead up to calling the person who is selected. They take the apostle who is the 
oldest in terms of tenure or seniority. And it's been that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: To what do you attribute the growth of your church? 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter: I think it's the interest that is generated by the membership of the 
church, largely. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, we have an aggressive missionary program. Missionaries, largely 
young people between the ages of 19 and 21 . . . go on missions for the church 
and give their time for a two-year period. That's a great factor (in church 
growth). Our young people consider (missions) an obligation that they have in 
their education. Some can hardly wait for the day and time to come around so 
they can go. Other churches have a system whereby they pay expenses and some 
pay the salaries of missionaries. We don't do either. . . . (Mormon 
missionaries) go because they want to go and consider it a privilege. And so we 
interview very carefully with respect to morals, in particular. . . . We have 
these clean, young people who respond morally. They have to live a good life to 
be called to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I understand that a young Mormon may be barred from missionary work if he 
or she has had even one sexual indiscretion. Previously, one indiscretion would 
result in a one-year delay. Why the tightened standard?  
</P>
<P>
 Hunter: I don't know if I can give you a reason for that. . . . But we find 
that in order to combat the violation of moral codes, we have to take a strong 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The Mormon Church has long been known and respected for its emphasis on the 
family as the basic building block of society. Now you seem to be placing even 
more emphasis on it.  
</P>
<P>
 Hunter: We've placed great emphasis on that in recent years because we believe 
it's basic. Society's been changed and for those who give a listening ear in 
trying to hold the line on morals etc., it's caused them to (take a) deeper 
stand and a more urgent stand concerning this. . . . Basically, there is the 
matter of righteousness and unrighteous conduct. The two can't be reconciled 
unless heed is given to that which is right. . . . That's why we have given 
attention as we do to the family.

<P>
 The just-launched Los Angeles Mammography Promotion in Churches Program is the 
first large-scale trial of an innovative approach to boosting breast cancer 
screening. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Fox of the RAND Corp., a veteran cancer control specialist who is 
directing the five-year, $4.6-million research project funded by the National 
Cancer Institute, said the program is unique in two respects. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, it is focused exclusively on low-income women whose use of mammograms 
remains 36% below the rest of the population," she said. "And it is a 
collaborative partnership that gives churches an opportunity to make an 
important contribution to improving the health of older women, especially 
minority women." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox's team is about to mail questionnaires to the pastors of 1,400 
congregations in 30 communities in Southwest Los Angeles. Ultimately, more than 
3,000 women from churches representing several denominations will be chosen to 
participate. Equal numbers of predominantly African American, Latino and white 
congregations will be represented in the final mix.  
</P>
<P>
 Women who are members of the churches will be trained and paid by the project 
to serve as part-time peer counselors. Using a variety of approaches aimed at 
increasing regular use of mammography, the counselors will focus on barriers to 
the procedure. (Fox said that previous studies have pinpointed cost, 
transportation, anxiety and fear of cancer as some of the reasons women give 
for not receiving mammograms. Physicians who fail to recommend mammograms are 
another major barrier.) 
</P>
<P>
 "We will also train people to follow up and keep these traditionally 
under-screened women on a mammography program," Fox said, "because having one 
mammogram is like having your teeth cleaned just once -- it's essentially 
worthless." 
</P>
<P>
 The project will help churches create health committees, which will continue 
to function after the study has ended. Participating churches will also receive 
computer training, hardware and software, which they may keep for the screening 
program as well as for other church activities. "We want to leave something 
with these congregations," Fox said. "So often poor communities feel ripped off 
by the research community." 
</P>
<P>
 If the program is successful in boosting early detection -- the only proven 
method of controlling breast cancer -- she said, "there's no reason why it 
shouldn't work in other American cities." 
</P>

THEORIES VARY ON RECENT WAVE OF MARY SIGHTINGS; CATHOLICISM: BELIEVERS ARE 
DRAWN TO SITES OF APPARITIONS. SKEPTICS CHALLENGE MIRACULOUS CLAIMS.

<P>
 For the chance of beholding an apparition of the Mother of God, Monica 
Banuelos made the long trek with eight members of her family in one of 10 buses 
from Juarez, Mexico, to a farm in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why?" she said of her pilgrimage. "Because we love the Virgin." 
</P>
<P>
 Banuelos and tens of thousands of true believers from all 50 states as well as 
other nations have been drawn to the home of Nancy Fowler, a homemaker from 
Conyers, Ga., who claims the Virgin Mary appeared to her on Oct. 13, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The vision has returned on the 13th day of most months, and Mrs. Fowler said 
she saw the vision Oct. 13 on the ceiling of an "apparition room." 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of other sightings of Mary have been reported in the United States in 
the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 At a modest tract house in Hollywood, Fla., Rosa Lopez says Mary appears to 
her on the 13th of each month. She had received well water thought to have 
curative powers from Conyers and visited Mrs. Fowler's property before the 
visions started. 
</P>
<P>
 Other sightings have been reported in Marlboro, N.J.; Denver; Cold Spring, 
Ky.; Scottsdale, Ariz., and Emmitsburg, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen a spate of these," said Charles Nuckolls, an Emory University 
anthropologist who studied the Hindu religion in India and has visited Conyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Nuckolls, like the Roman Catholic Church, is unconvinced that 
something miraculous is going on, he described the pilgrimages as a "serious 
cultural phenomenon." Theories about the proliferation of sightings range from 
the end of the millennium to personal isolation in a cold, technological world. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want immediate contact with something greater, bigger and more 
powerful than themselves. Religion can do that," Nuckolls said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have trekked to the sites claim to have seen the sun spinning on its 
axis, to have had chains on their rosaries transformed from silver to gold, or 
to have felt a heartbeat in statues of Mary -- proof to them that the 
apparitions are real. 
</P>
<P>
 Although skeptics don't doubt anyone's religious beliefs, they do challenge 
some of the miraculous claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people feel the Virgin Mary in their heart, that's a matter of personal 
religious choice, and people are entitled to their beliefs," said Joe Nickell, 
who has investigated such sightings for the Committee for the Scientific 
Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just see no evidence there is anything of a supernatural or miraculous 
nature at these places, other than a kind of emotional contagion, ranging from 
spiritual revival all the way to mass hysteria," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nickell offered some explanations for what people perceive: stare at an object 
long enough and it appears to move because of an optical illusion; the silver 
coat on a rosary chain can erode to reveal its golden brass base; and those who 
hold their thumb to a statue may feel their own pulse. 
</P>
<P>
 He found no heartbeat when he placed a stethoscope to the Conyers statue. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. sightings proliferated after a 1981 vision of Mary by six youths in the 
mountain village of Medjugorje, Bosnia. Nickell said it led to an outbreak of 
"Medjugorje virus" in America. 
</P>
<P>
 The Catholic Church, which takes an ultra-cautious view of such matters, is 
still investigating the Bosnia sighting. Church policy dictates that the local 
bishop conduct the first inquiry if he feels it's warranted, then a team of 
investigators from the Vatican authenticates any findings. The process can take 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the U.S. sightings, such as the one in Conyers, are linked to Oct. 
13. That's the date in 1917 when the Virgin Mary made the final in a series of 
appearances to three children in Fatima, Portugal, which ranks with Lourdes, 
France, as one of the world's most famous shrines to Mary. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Fowler has said Mary appears on the 13th because the apparitions are 
"linked directly to Fatima." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she was told this month that Mary would no longer appear monthly, but 
only on the yearly anniversary date. That came as good news locally to some 
weary nonbelievers who have sported bumper stickers reading: "Eat, Drink and 
See Mary." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fatima and Lourdes appearances have been authenticated by the church, but 
no inquiry has begun yet in Conyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fully acknowledge that people are seeking something they don't seem to be 
finding elsewhere," said the Rev. Peter Dora, spokesman for the Atlanta 
Archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the same breath, we are concerned about the damage this could do to these 
believers if it turns out to be false," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But those who have faith are resolute that what they are seeing is real, no 
matter where the Virgin Mary appears. 
</P>
<P>
 "What one person sees, another may not," said a sobbing Susan Butler, 26, 
outside Lopez's house in Florida. "If you believe, you'll see it."

MAN SENTENCED UNDER '3 STRIKES LAW' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MURPHY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Simi Valley man who has been arrested at least 22 times since 1971 on Friday 
became the first Ventura County defendant to be sentenced under the state's new 
"three strikes law." 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Diaz, 41, was sentenced to prison for 31 years to life for his latest 
crime, having a sexual affair with a 13-year-old girl. He will be eligible for 
parole when he is 64, attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say Diaz -- who has been in prison three times for armed robbery 
and who killed a fellow inmate while incarcerated -- is a perfect candidate for 
the law, which mandates that a person with two serious felony convictions 
receive the same sentence for any third felony that a first-degree murderer 
gets. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz is one of seven defendants in the county charged under the "three strikes 
law," a district attorney's spokeswoman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Neil B. Quinn said he thinks it is unfair when a third 
felony, which may not be that serious, can send a defendant to prison for life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a suspicion that if they actually looked at Mr. Diaz, that the people 
who wrote 'three strikes' would want him in prison whether he committed any new 
crimes or not," Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz pleaded guilty in August to four counts of felony child molestation. One 
of the offenses occurred after March 8, when the "three strikes law" took 
effect, so conviction on that charge carried a mandatory sentence of 25 years 
to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Superior Court Judge Bruce A. Clark imposed an additional six years for 
the other three child molestation charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz's case was in trial when he decided to plead guilty. He tried 
unsuccessfully on Friday to withdraw the guilty plea, saying he was confused 
about what he was doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn urged Clark to impose the minimum sentence of three years for the three 
molestation counts that fell outside the "three strikes law." That sentence, 
when paired with the term of 25 years to life, "is way more than is 
appropriate," the defense attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hope that Mr. Diaz has that he may be able to die as an old man outside 
prison walls was certainly a factor in his changing his plea," Quinn said. "But 
there is no guarantee he will do that. The mere eligibility for parole is a far 
cry from being paroled." 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn stressed the consensual nature of Diaz's affair with the teen-ager in 
urging as lenient a sentence as possible. He also noted that the girl "doesn't 
want Henry Diaz to do a day in jail." 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Dist. Atty. Patrice D. Koenig, who urged a 12-year sentence in 
addition to the 25 years to life, said it was the totality of Diaz's criminal 
record, not just his most recent crimes, that justified a tough sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "His history depicts a man unconcerned with the consequences of his actions," 
Koenig said. "He knew what he was doing and he failed to stop."

OBITUARIES; LYNN FROBISHER; SIMI VALLEY POLICE DISPATCHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lynn Frobisher, the terminally ill Simi Valley police dispatcher who received 
a $25,000 donation from city employees last month, has died. She was 47. 
</P>
<P>
 With her teen-age children nearby, the woman who inspired even strangers to 
donate vacation time for her welfare died at 9:30 a.m. Thursday in her Simi 
Valley home. She had been told in February, 1993, that she had cancer, and her 
doctor informed her on Sept. 13 that she had one to three months to live. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Police Department has suffered the loss of one its major morale 
boosters," Lt. Rex Jones said. "She was quick-witted, humorous and real fun. . 
. .. She'll be missed a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Frobisher, a Los Angeles policewoman from 1969 to 1975, had spent about 13 
years as a dispatcher with the Simi Valley Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 To shore up her dwindling savings and defray her family's living expenses, 180 
city employees pooled $31,719.52 in just a few days by giving up some of their 
vacation time. One person sacrificed a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what to say, other than, 'Thank you,' " Frobisher said on Sept. 
23, before being presented with a check. Some of the donation went to taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Frobisher is survived by her 19-year-old daughter, Jennifer Walker, and her 
17-year-old son, Richard Walker. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service will be held Monday at 7 p.m. at United Methodist Church at 
2394 Erringer Road in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In lieu of flowers, the family requested that donations be made to the Simi 
Valley Police Department's canine program.

11 MEN AND 4 BOYS ARE ARRESTED AT HOMES IN CONEJO VALLEY GANG SWEEP; LAW 
ENFORCEMENT: THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT-LED OPERATION IS SPURRED BY A DRIVE-BY 
SHOOTING THAT WOUNDED A PREGNANT NEWBURY PARK WOMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Still without a suspect in a drive-by shooting that wounded a pregnant Newbury 
Park woman, the Sheriff's Department led a 115-officer sweep through the Conejo 
Valley early Friday, rounding up suspected gang members on probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers from eight law enforcement agencies arrested 11 men and four boys on 
parole violations after searching 18 residences in Newbury Park, Thousand Oaks 
and Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 All whose homes were raided had terms in their probation agreements that allow 
random searches without warrants, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided to make the sweep when we still didn't have someone in custody 
after the first day" of investigating shots fired into a Newbury Park house 
late Tuesday, Sheriff Larry Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
 During Friday's raids, authorities recovered one .22-caliber semiautomatic 
handgun, a fully loaded shotgun and some marijuana, Carpenter said. Some 
suspects also violated probation by possessing drug paraphernalia and gang 
writings and photographs, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the weapons were not related to the drive-by shooting, and none of those 
arrested are thought to have been involved, the sheriff said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of these individuals will serve additional time in jail for the 
violations of their probation," Carpenter said. "But obviously they are not the 
main targets of the investigation. These sweeps do several things: We can 
obtain information about the shooting, as well as send a strong message to gang 
members that we have zero tolerance for this kind of activity in Ventura 
County." 
</P>
<P>
 Local police agencies began their raids of gang members' homes in 1992 as a 
way of quashing youth violence that has become much more common this decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the raids have occurred in the west county because the 
violence was focused there, an increase in east county gang crime has led to 
several sweeps, including one in April. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said all the targets of this raid were members or associates of 
Conejo Valley gangs, but there is still no clear evidence that Tuesday's 
drive-by shooting was gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what gangs do though," said Sheriff's Cmdr. Kathryn Kemp, who 
oversees police activity in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The last east county drive-by occurred in Newbury Park and involved two rival 
Westlake High School gangs, Kemp said. While this incident matches the pattern 
of other gang-related violence, she said investigators have not ruled out other 
motives. 
</P>
<P>
 After interviews with more than 60 neighbors of the wounded woman, detectives 
believe that youths mistakenly fired into her home, intending to hurt a gang 
rival, Detective Joe Braga said. The 34-year-old woman was wounded in the 
thigh, but not seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond a description of the assailant's car, detectives have released no 
information on the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are following up tips that a dark-colored subcompact car sped 
away immediately after the shooting. Braga said detectives believe they know 
who was the intended victim, but would not identify the person. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they hope Friday's sweep will bring more leads. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to get a lot of real good information about who is doing what in the 
area," Carpenter said.  
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter said he also hoped that local gang members are put off guard by the 
raid. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the gangsters that should be the ones peeking out of their doors and 
ducking and dodging while they go down the street, not everybody else," he 
said.

UFW-GROWER PACT PREVENTS STRIKE; LABOR: TENTATIVE AGREEMENT BETWEEN UNION AND 
MURANAKA FARMS WOULD LEAD TO THE FIRST PAY HIKE IN FOUR YEARS FOR WORKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A promise of pay raises for workers at Muranaka Farms has averted a 
potentially ruinous strike and given a much needed boost to the beleaguered 
farm workers union. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While the tentative agreement reached this week covers only a fraction of the 
workers' demands, union representatives said Friday that a strike seems 
unlikely if progress continues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could still go on strike if everything falls apart," said Mario Brito, the 
regional manager for the United Farm Workers, which represents the workers. 
"This is just a tentative agreement, but it looks like a strike won't be 
necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 If the two sides sign a contract, it will be one of only three existing farm 
labor contracts in the county. And it could mean the first pay hike in four 
years for workers at the farm near Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Muranaka officials characterized the latest development not so much as a 
tentative agreement but as the union's acceptance of a company offer for pay 
hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've made offers at every single meeting," said company President Harry 
Muranaka. "I think this just amounts to an acceptance of some of the terms we 
offered. But I would agree that we are more optimistic now that something can 
be worked out than after any other meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 The company offered to raise the salaries of its 150 field hands and 
packinghouse workers from 5% to 9% for the first year of a three-year contract, 
Brito said. Workers make from $12,000 to $14,000 harvesting and packing such 
crops as parsley, cilantro, and leeks on about 450 acres the company owns. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated by two months of what they say had been fruitless negotiations, 
workers said they would go on strike this week unless the company made a 
satisfactory offer. A meeting Tuesday with company officials and members of a 
workers' negotiating team went smoothly, Brito said, and the two sides were 
able to outline the tentative agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fairly decent amount, but it's just for the first year," Brito said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Workers have been without a contract since 1992, and have not had a raise 
since 1990. Now they want their pay increase to match the changes in the cost 
of living since that time, and they want their salaries to continue to keep 
pace with inflation, Brito said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want some guarantees about the remaining two years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The union's vehemence in the Muranaka negotiations is part of a nationwide 
strategy by the United Farm Workers to reinvigorate its ranks, Brito said. Once 
a stronghold of support, union membership in Ventura County dropped from 4,000 
in the early 1980s to 500 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The union is pushing for health benefits for workers and attempting to 
persuade the company to give workers more of a voice in management decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want the company to give over control of the day-to-day operations," 
he said. "We just want to be involved on some level that really just guarantees 
the life of the company. Just look at Ford (Motor Co.). Ever since they 
involved workers in the management of their factories they have been 
profitable." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Muranaka Farms has struggled through some difficult financial times over the 
last 10 years. The company has had to scale back its Moorpark operation, 
reducing the number of acres planted from a peak of 800 acres in the late 1980s 
to about 450 acres this year. During the same period the company has used an 
increasing number of acres in Mexico, going from 200 in the early 1980s to 
about 2,500 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the cheaper costs, the company can do more labor-intensive work in 
Mexico, Muranaka said. For instance, workers in Mexico trim and peel onions 
that are sold for a premium price to markets in England, Muranaka said. On its 
Moorpark farm labor costs are too high to do similar work. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent demands made by the union had the company pondering whether it 
would keep the local operation afloat, but Muranaka said moving to Mexico would 
be a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 He, like union representative Brito, was optimistic that the two sides would 
reach an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we both are thinking in terms of how we can work together to make the 
company prosper," Muranaka said.

CALABASAS CITY COUNCIL JOINS SUPPORT FOR MTA LOBBYIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Calabasas City Council has voted to join a program in which a group of 
cities hope to band together to pay the salary of a lobbyist to represent their 
interests at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas, which has committed to paying $1,566 toward the salary of the 
lobbyist, acted on the urging of Larry Zarian, vice chairman of MTA's board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The volume and variety of technical issues facing the MTA board requires an 
extensive amount of research, analysis, investigation and preparation prior to 
meetings," Zarian, who is also on the Glendale City Council, wrote in a letter 
to 11 cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that hiring a full-time staff person for our corridor is essential 
to adequately represent our interests to the MTA." 
</P>
<P>
 The staff person would be paid about $50,000 annually plus benefits, Zarian 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping this person would be an ombudsman and get us the transportation we 
need," said Calabasas Mayor Karyn Foley. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas officials, Foley said, want the city's bus line extended past the 
Valley Circle interchange. Extended service is also needed in Calabasas Park, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Calabasas, Foley said, might also be able to provide a high school 
student to work as an intern to help the lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
 The formula for how much each city would pay is based on its population, said 
Zarian. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cities that have been invited to join are Agoura Hills, Burbank, 
Glendale, La Canada Flintridge, Hidden Hills, Lancaster, Malibu, Palmdale, San 
Fernando, Santa Clarita and Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our initial discussions indicate that some of the cities are very 
supportive," Zarian wrote. He asked the cities to sign non-binding letters of 
intent saying they want to join.

CRESPI EDGES ST. PAUL IN FINAL SECONDS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dave Lins' nine-yard touchdown pass to Marcos Solorzano with 12 seconds 
remaining Friday night lifted Crespi High to a dramatic 14-13 upset over 
previously undefeated St. Paul in a Del Rey League game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd run that play three or four times earlier in the game, but always to the 
flop side," Crespi Coach Tim Lins said of the decisive play."This time Dave 
went to the other side where there was man-to-man coverage."

 The key play of the 14-play, 49-yard drive came on fourth and one at the St. 
Paul 22-yard line when Lins caught his batted pass and ran around right end for 
a first down. "It was supposed to be a hitch and go," said Lins, who completed 
21 of 24 attempts for 164 yards. "We got lucky. The ball came right back to me 
and I just ran." 
</P>
<P>
 Crespi (4-3 overall, 2-0 in league play) capped an eight-play, 55-yard drive 
with a 17-yard option pass from wide receiver Wayne Emerson to Jeff DeFinney 
with just under 8 1/2 minutes remaining in the second quarter, cutting St. 
Paul's lead to 10-7.

SYLMAR MAKES EASY WORK OF OF VAN NUYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When Van Nuys reviews film of Friday night's Valley Pac-8 Conference game 
against Sylmar for highlight material, it can turn off the VCR early. The 
Wolves can cut the power before the end of the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Three minutes 13 seconds into what turned into a 48-12 blowout by the 
Spartans, Federico Arroyo kicked a 22-yard field goal to narrow Sylmar's lead 
to 14-9 and give the home fans some hope. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when Van Nuys film editors can press the "off" button and dump the 
video in the trash -- or mail it to Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior running back Durell Price, who rushed for a career-high four 
touchdowns, ran 16 yards up the middle for a touchdown on the first play of the 
second quarter: 21-9, Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
 Davon Young returned an Arroyo punt 62 yards for a touchdown. Two Van Nuys 
plays later, Tyrone Morgan went airborne with tailback John McPherson for a 
pass, snatched it out of McPherson's hands and raced 40 yards for a touchdown 
with the interception: 34-9, Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
 Still in the second quarter -- and following a diving interception by Young -- 
Price ran 49 yards up the middle. He slipped three tackles and scored: 48-9, 
Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 This was supposed to be a showdown but the Van Nuys defense failed to show up, 
despite the high stakes involved. Both teams were 3-0 in conference play. 
Sylmar, ranked second in The Times' Valley poll, improved to 7-0, 4-0. Van Nuys 
is 5-2, 3-1. The only damage inflicted by Van Nuys, which missed running back 
Larry Reed (13 touchdowns, knee injury), was that it ended Sylmar's four-game 
string of shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
 That didn't faze Price, who had 143 yards in 13 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight was the start of us peaking," Price said. "We had a couple letdowns 
that we can't afford in the playoffs. Other than that, I'm pretty satisfied 
with the score." 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd Chalk of Sylmar gained 99 yards in eight carries, 80 on his first three 
runs.

WESTERN STATE CONFERENCE CROSS-COUNTRY MEET; WILSON HAS UPS AND DOWNS, WINS 
AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Talk about contrasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the second Western State Conference cross-country meet of the 
season at College of the Canyons on Friday, Jeff Wilson of Moorpark College 
appeared to be out for a nice easy training run. 
</P>
<P>
 But 10 minutes after winning the race, Wilson was gingerly walking around with 
a painful grimace on his face. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts so bad," Wilson said to one of the meet managers. "(This course) is 
worse than Mt. (San Antonio College). It's constantly going up and down. At 
least Mt. SAC has some flat spots." 
</P>
<P>
 Flat terrain or not, Wilson was never seriously challenged as he ran 21 
minutes 35 seconds over the four-mile course to post his fifth victory of the 
season without a loss. 
</P>
<P>
 With Glendale's Jacques Sallberg out with the flu, Wilson was not expected to 
be pushed and he wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 He shared the early lead with Ramon Serratos of Canyons before opening up a 
four-second advantage after a mile (5:06) and a nine-second gap at two miles 
(10:34). 
</P>
<P>
 "The race started out too fast," Wilson said. "The first mile was too fast, 
but when the guy from Canyons took the lead, I figured it was his course and he 
ought to know how to run it. So I went with him." 
</P>
<P>
 When Serratos -- who finished ninth in 23:08 -- began to fade after the first 
mile, Wilson found himself in front by himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "That scared me at first," he said. "Other than that, I didn't give it much 
thought. I just concentrated on maintaining my pace and getting up and down 
these hills." 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale freshman Jose Padilla was Wilson's closest pursuer at two miles, but 
when Vaquero Coach Eddie Lopez encouraged him to set his sights on Wilson's 
fleeing back, Padilla appeared more concerned with trying to hold onto second. 
</P>
<P>
 He was unable to do so, but it didn't hurt Glendale as Nacho Delgado (21:47), 
Padilla (21:56), Eduardo Macias (22:39) and Adrian Baca (22:42) finished second 
through fifth for the Vaqueros, the top-ranked team in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by those four, Glendale totaled 22 points, followed by Bakersfield (71), 
Moorpark (79), Santa Barbara City (103) and Canyons (128). 
</P>
<P>
 Like Wilson, Josephina Sanchez of Ventura won her second WSC meet of the 
season and like Glendale, the Pirate women repeated their first-place team 
showing. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez, a 1992 graduate of Hueneme High, was a runaway winner in the first 
WSC meet in San Luis Obispo, but she was pushed to the limit by Canyons' Heidi 
Tisovic on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez and Glendale's Tanya Janet led the field through the first mile in 
6:10 with Tisovic third at 6:15. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez broke away from Janet shortly thereafter, however, and she had a 
80-yard lead over Tisovic at two miles. 
</P>
<P>
 But the heat and the hilly course began to take their toll on Sanchez as 
Tisovic caught her going up the final hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was aware she was catching me, but there wasn't much I could do about it," 
Sanchez said. "I was really tired and I was dehydrating bad out there. But I 
was confident that I could stay with her once she caught me and outkick her at 
the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez did exactly that, surging past Tisovic on the final downhill portion 
of the course to time 20:01 over the three-mile distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Tisovic was second in 20:05, followed by Janet (20:31) and Moorpark's 
Christine Weigert (20:47). 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura's Barbara Moreno (21:26) and Christy Ruffin (21:31) finished seventh 
and eighth to help the Pirates turn back Canyons, 49-58. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale finished third with 96 points, followed by Bakersfield (97) and 
Cuesta (108). 
</P>
<P>
 The first two WSC meets of the season each count 25% toward the conference 
title, with the WSC finals on Nov. 8 worth 50%.

NOTRE DAME'S DEFENSE CONTINUES TO STAND UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three times running back Dion Battee challenged the Notre Dame High defensive 
line. Three times Battee was stacked up for no gain inches short of the end 
zone, the final attempt on fourth down. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, Notre Dame's second-quarter goal-line stand proved pivotal in the 
Knights' 21-0 Mission League victory Friday night over St. Bernard at Notre 
Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Notre Dame (6-1, 2-0) was clinging to a 7-0 lead, while St. 
Bernard (3-4, 0-2) -- beginning the quarter with a 10-play, 79-yard drive -- 
appeared to be gaining momentum like rolling stones. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the first of four futile line plunges from inside the two-yard line, 
the first by tailback Jerome Heavens. After a Viking timeout, Battee's final 
attempt came up short by what appeared to be only an inch. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about getting no satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was one real nice job by the defense," Notre Dame Coach Kevin Rooney 
said. "It was great that we were able to suck it up and stop them. Defensively, 
we've been playing quite well." 
</P>
<P>
 The shutout was the second for Notre Dame, which has yielded only 56 points. 
The Knights held St. Bernard to 127 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame totaled 277 yards, including 108 rushing in 11 carries by senior 
John Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame did not allow St. Bernard to penetrate past the Knight 34 for the 
remainder of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior quarterback Ryan Bowne capped a 77-yard drive to begin the second half 
with an eight-yard bootleg for a touchdown. Late in the third quarter, Notre 
Dame recovered a bad snap on a St. Bernard punt and had a first down at the 
Viking four. Two plays later, Garcia ran one yard for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights moved the ball effectively in the first half but scored only on 
fullback Don Ebenhoch's six-yard run, which capped a seven-play, 58-yard drive 
sustained by a 15-yard face-mask penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Ebonhoch added 48 yards in seven carries, and Alvan Arzu rushed for 24 yards 
in six carries.

BUENA HAMMERS OUT 10-10 TIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRIS WYKES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pardon the Buena Bulldogs, if after a second consecutive tie, they don't feel 
like kissing their kicker. 
</P>
<P>
 James Hammer's extra point with 1:25 to play gave Buena (4-1-2, 2-0-2) a 10-10 
deadlock with Santa Barbara Friday night, but judging by the long faces on the 
Bulldog sidelines, it wasn't the desired result.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a loss," said Buena quarterback Glenn Dudley, who engineered an 
89-yard, 10-play scoring drive in the final 3 1/2 minutes to bring the Bulldogs 
back. "You just can't feel good about things." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard took a one-game lead over Buena in the Channel League standings with a 
victory Friday night over Dos Pueblos, which held Buena to a 27-27 tie last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena was on the defensive early, when Santa Barbara tailback Khalid Hurst 
raced 88 yards for a touchdown on the Dons' first play from scrimmage.  
</P>
<P>
 Hurst piled up 182 yards in the first half and finished with 244 in 36 
carries, but couldn't crack the goal line a second time as the Buena defense 
began to zero in on him in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs drove to Santa Barbara's nine-yard line early in the second half 
but could only come away with Hammer's 32-yard field goal.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dons' Cesar Abrego answered with a 39-yard field goal on Santa Barbara's 
next drive. 
</P>
<P>
 After four consecutive completions to move into Santa Barbara territory, the 
Bulldogs ran on four of the next five plays, bringing them to the Dons' 21-yard 
line on first down. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-3 Dudley spied tailback Josh Cross running a post pattern from the right 
side and drilled him with a scoring pass to bring Buena within one point. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to throw it as hard as possible," said Dudley, who finished 22 of 31 
with an interception and a touchdown.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our receivers were wide open most of the night and Josh sure was on that 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara (4-2-1, 2-1-1) nearly pulled off a comeback of its own, when 
Michael Garrett intercepted Dudley's pass at the Bulldogs' 31 with only seconds 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
 An initial 52-yard field goal attempt by Jorge Flores was short, and after 
Buena was penalized for roughing the kicker, a 37-yard try by Abrego fluttered 
wide to the left with no time remaining.

MACLEAN HESITATES, GRANADA HILLS IS LOST, 17-14 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dazed and confused, Granada Hills High's Brian MacLean looked toward the 
sideline. He had driven his team deep into Taft territory in the closing 
seconds of the Northwest Valley Conference showdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three seconds remained after MacLean's completion to Eric Carpenter put 
the ball at the Toreadors' eight-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 The visiting Highlanders trailed, 17-14. They had no timeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials were spotting the ball and about to signal for the clock to 
continue. Coach Tom Harp thought about a tying field goal, but there was not 
enough time to get the kicking unit in position. 
</P>
<P>
 The offense stayed on the field. MacLean stepped toward the line, unsure what 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what the hell was going on," he said. "I heard Coach Harp yell, 
'Field goal -- get ready' a couple of plays earlier, so I didn't know what we 
were doing. All of a sudden the clock ran out." 
</P>
<P>
 The horn sounded before the Highlanders could run a play, and Taft, which 
built a 17-0 lead early in the third quarter, had withstood Granada Hills' 
spirited comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were eight yards away from winning," Harp said. "But everything was 
confused. We wanted to go for the end zone on the previous play. I wasn't 
trying to leave us eight yards short, that's for sure." Taft (6-1, 4-0) is 
alone atop the conference standings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toreadors built their lead on a first-quarter touchdown pass from Dayon 
Shaw to DaShon Polk and Jerry Brown's 11-yard touchdown run in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills (4-3, 3-1), frustrated by twice having first-and-goal 
opportunities in the first half but not scoring, finally broke through. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first play of the fourth quarter, Jason Ascencio faked a punt and 
instead threw a 31-yard pass to Carpenter for a first down. Eric Richardson 
scored on a 19-yard run on the next play. 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills recovered a fumble at the Taft 30-yard line on the ensuing 
kickoff and Richardson scored three plays later. 
</P>
<P>
 MacLean finished with 16 completions in 32 attempts for 202 yards. Carpenter 
had eight catches for 106 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft's Brown rushed for 139 yards.

 A foursome of senior administrators at Cal State Northridge met informally 
Friday and agreed to immediately begin assembling a series of athletic funding 
scenarios to present to President Blenda J. Wilson sometime over the next few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Kopita, Northridge dean of students, said athletic department officials 
will spend the next few days poring over possible revenue sources after a key 
athletics fee referendum was narrowly defeated by student vote this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of projected shortfalls in the athletic budget for next year and 
beyond, a handful of sports programs face possible elimination, which could 
jeopardize the school's Division I status. 
</P>
<P>
 Kopita met Friday with Athletic Director Bob Hiegert and associate athletic 
directors Judy Brame and Debby DeAngelis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to begin coming up with ideas about all the 'what ifs' involved," 
Kopita said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson will be out of town next week, but Kopita hopes to schedule a meeting 
the following week. 
</P>
<P>
 The referendum, which would have generated approximately $2.25 million 
annually for athletics, was defeated in the largest election turnout in school 
history. It marked the second referendum defeat for athletics in 1994.

HART TRIES NOT TO TRIP ON VEER; FOOTBALL: INDIANS PUT 6-0 RECORD ON THE LINE IN 
NONLEAGUE GAME AGAINST PALM SPRINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 So this is what it is like to play for the No. 1 team in the Valley. On Friday 
night you beat rival Canyon, 42-19, and on Monday you spend three hours staring 
at the game film and get your ears bent by dissatisfied coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellas, this is not good enough.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's the longest film session we've had since I've been here," said Rick 
Herrington, Hart's defensive coordinator the past eight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably played our worst defensive game of the year. We had guys out of 
position, guys back on their heels waiting, instead of going after people." 
</P>
<P>
 The Herringtons -- Rick and brothers Mike (head coach) and Dean (offensive 
coordinator) -- felt the Indians needed a wake-up call before tonight's 
nonleague game at Palm Springs (3-3). 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys are sometimes too businesslike," Rick Herrington said. "I wish 
they'd get a little more excited for a game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians (6-0), ranked No. 1 in The Times' Valley poll, have the area's 
second-best offense in yardage per game (411.3) and a defense that alarmingly 
ranks seventh worst, yielding 319.7 yards per outing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must have re-run every play 10 or 15 times," Rick Herrington said. "But I 
think we got it in their brains that they can win by a big margin and still not 
play well." 
</P>
<P>
 Palm Springs Coach Chris Calderwood, however, is counting on his veer-option 
attack to make Hart play poorly and lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Palm Springs, also nicknamed the Indians, scored as many points as Hart last 
week in a 42-21 victory over Central Union of El Centro. 
</P>
<P>
 Calderwood said Palm Springs has some advantages. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might surprise these guys," he said. "They've got to drive 3 1/2 hours. I 
think we're faster than they are. Our strength is that our skill guys are real 
good. We have a chance to make a name for ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Calderwood's only concern is that Hart's big offensive line might dominate, 
allowing quarterback Steve McKeon (67 of 107 for 1,196 yards and 11 touchdowns) 
and running back Ted Iacenda (629 yards rushing, 355 receiving, 18 touchdowns) 
to dictate the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm confident in the fact we'll move the ball on them," he said. "The concern 
is if we can stop them." 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Herrington could be more concerned about stopping Palm Springs, where 
quarterback Bishop Miller has passed for nearly 300 yards and rushed for 250 in 
two games since switching from running back. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, filling in for injured quarterback John Dreisbach, rushed for four 
touchdowns last week. Titus Holland, Miller's replacement at tailback, rushed 
for 100 yards and fullback Rommel Lopez had 46. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Miller is) a real good athlete," Herrington said. "But it looks like a lot 
of what they run is predetermined. In the past, we've been pretty good against 
the option. The kids usually do a pretty good job on reads. They don't leave 
guys open." 
</P>
<P>
 Palm Springs hopes to catch Hart flat-footed on play-action passes. That 
doesn't concern Herrington, who said his team only has trouble with 
quarterbacks like Canyon's Ahjeron Palmer (who rushed for 134 yards in nine 
carries last week) who run bootleg plays out of pro sets. 
</P>
<P>
 Palm Springs won't disguise the option, but watch out anyway, Calderwood 
warned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've just started to get into our rhythm," he said. "If we didn't turn the 
ball over three times inside the 20 and give Indio 20 points two weeks ago, 
we'd be 4-2." 
</P>

 Harvard-Westlake High will defend its share of first place in the Camino Real 
League today when the Wolverines play host to Verbum Dei at 1:30. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard (4-1-1), which moved from the Mission League last season, defeated 
Cantwell Sacred Heart, 31-6, in last week's league opener. Verbum Dei (5-1), 
which defeated Burbank, 15-14, last week in a nonleague game, is playing its 
league opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior tailback Abed Abusaleh has carried the load in Harvard's run-oriented 
attack. Abusaleh has rushed for 385 yards and five touchdowns in 75 carries but 
has been nursing a bruised right shoulder since the first week of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Abusaleh rushed for two touchdowns against Cantwell but spent the fourth 
quarter on the bench with his shoulder wrapped in ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Abusaleh is expected to play. Derek Lemkin has passed for 884 yards and 11 
touchdowns.

...IN THEIR WILDEST DREAMS; THE ACTOR: FREDDY'S BACK, ONLY THIS TIME HE'S AFTER 
ROBERT ENGLUND, WHO PLAYS HIMSELF IN THE LATEST SEQUEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Freddy's back. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time it's not the good folks on Elm Street that Freddy Krueger, the 
fiendish dream stalker, is targeting. This time he's after Robert Englund, the 
actor behind the gruesome mass of burned scar tissue. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Wes Craven's New Nightmare," Englund plays himself. He also reprises his 
recurring role as Freddy, the demonic terror with the razor-sharp finger blades 
who turns up this time in Hollywood to haunt the actors and filmmakers behind 
the popular "Nightmare on Elm Street" movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Englund hadn't expected to do another Freddy Krueger movie. After the sixth 
one -- "Freddy's Dead: The Last Nightmare" (1991) -- he swore it would be the 
last. In fact, he said, that's what the studio, New Line Cinema, told everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 But then director Craven wrote a new script so good, he said, "that no one 
could resist. It was too rich."  
</P>
<P>
 Back home in Laguna Beach after two weeks of promoting the film on the talk 
show circuit, Englund said he got a kick out of playing himself on screen for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Art, however, did not imitate life. 
</P>
<P>
 In the film, he's shown living in a stereotypical movie-star manor that, he 
said, "is actually one of those great old dowager Spanish mansions out by the 
Rose Bowl. It's so funny. I walked in that place and said, 'God, Wes! You half 
expect Gloria Swanson to walk down the stairs.' It looked like Norma Desmond's 
digs."  
</P>
<P>
 Englund conceded that playing himself in a movie "was a little strange, but it 
was fun sending ourselves up. I mean, I don't live in a big mansion in 
Pasadena. I live in a little two-bedroom cottage in Laguna Beach. And I don't 
walk around in Armani suits all the time."  
</P>
<P>
 An on-screen difference that fans of the series probably will notice is that 
Freddy's face has evolved, having become more elongated in the new movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "The brow is different, the chin is longer and fuller, the skull a little more 
peaked," explained Englund, who also had to wear opaque contact lenses "from 
hell" that covered his entire eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked in tunnel vision the whole time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not giving too much away to say that Englund didn't have to fight himself 
(as in Freddy Krueger versus Robert Englund) in the movie. But there's no 
denying that Englund is being haunted by Freddy. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the big question is whether "Wes Craven's New Nightmare" finally spells 
finis for Freddy. Englund said he's the wrong person to answer that one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the poor guy that got put on the sacrificial altar last time. My 
credibility is shot," Englund said, laughing. "I never say never after this 
one."

REVOLUTION OF INDEPENDENTS; POP MUSIC: TWO PROMOTERS WILL TRY TO BUILD A 
REPUTATION WITH ONE DAYLONG CONCERT FEATURING 75 UP-AND-COMING BANDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Not even the legendary 76 trombones are a match for 75 rock bands. 
</P>
<P>
 In a concert that shapes up as possibly the biggest parade of grass-roots 
talent the Orange County music scene has ever witnessed, 75 bands, most of them 
new or emerging local acts, are scheduled to blare today from six stages on the 
grounds of Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. The 12-hour marathon, which gets 
underway at 12:30 p.m., is dubbed Independent's Day '94.  
</P>
<P>
 At least two bands, and sometimes three, will be playing simultaneously 
throughout the festival. The lineup includes no major headliners, but it offers 
ample opportunity to sample a broad assortment of local punk, ska and 
alternative-rock bands that are unsigned or that record for small, independent 
labels. Each band will play about 25 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The sprawling show will be staged not inside the 15,000-capacity amphitheater, 
but mainly on its grassy outer concourse, which has room for about 5,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 The marathon concert represents a big financial risk and an even bigger 
logistic challenge for its organizers, two 25-year-old concert promoters who 
hope a successful Independent's Day will give them instant cachet in the 
booming modern/alternative rock market. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Cardullo and Jaime Munoz, who call their Fountain Valley-based company 
Taurus Enterprises, see the show as a chance to establish lasting relationships 
with bands. They also hope to notch an impressive credential for themselves as 
grass-roots promoters who can pull off an event on a scale that no promoter on 
the local-band scene has attempted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a big audition for us," Cardullo said Wednesday. "It's a make-or-break 
situation. We'd be happy to break even. Even if we lose a little money, but 
pull off a flawless show, we would all be happy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Taurus partners, who run a Monday night concert series at Music City in 
Fountain Valley, say that their overhead costs will run $45,000 to $50,000, 
most of it to rent the venue and pay for security and stage crews.  
</P>
<P>
 All the bands have agreed to play for free. Munoz said that only one band the 
promoters approached refused to perform without pay. The rest, who normally ply 
the local circuit's round of small clubs, leaped at a chance to play for a 
crowd that promoters hope will exceed 3,500 -- the number they say they need to 
draw to break even. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the exposure," Cardullo said. "(For the bands) it's all about getting 
seen by people, winning over new fans. I'd say (the chance to play at) Irvine 
Meadows has something to do with it. It's going to be a big party, getting to 
play with all their friends. Most of these bands don't get paid more than $100 
or $200 a show, so they're more than willing to play for the exposure." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Cardullo said, he had to turn away about 50 bands that couldn't be 
fit on the bill. "I told them I'd consider them for next year's show," said the 
promoter, who aims to stage a second Independent's Day in May. 
</P>
<P>
 The Taurus partners had planned to stage Independent's Day on July 3 at a site 
in Silverado Canyon but were balked by an unforeseen permitting problem. The 
Irvine Meadows lineup is more than twice as large as that original festival. 
Contrary to what has been implied in some of the advertising for Independent's 
Day, the show is a for-profit venture. The promoters have promised to donate 
15% of any profits to a youth-oriented local charity. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the action will take place on four stages set up at the center of the 
concession concourse, each one facing in a different compass direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other stages will be set up along the walkway leading from the 
amphitheater's parking lot to the concourse. One will feature ska music; the 
other will be devoted to bands made up of high-school students. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardullo said he added the extra stage for very young bands after one 
teen-ager complained that it wasn't fair that high schoolers weren't being 
considered. Cardullo said he was impressed when the young rocker vowed that his 
band would play anywhere the promoters could find room for them. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid set-change delays, each stage will have a communal drum kit and 
amplifier setup. Having consulted with his own hired sound company, and with 
the Irvine Meadows technical crew, Cardullo said he is confident that two bands 
can play simultaneously on the concourse, as long as they are facing in 
opposite directions. Fans in front of each stage should be able to hear without 
interference, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His worry is that musicians may be distracted by sound coming from another 
band playing directly behind them. The problem will be addressed by limiting 
the output of stage monitors the bands use to hear themselves play, and by 
putting up barriers to muffle the sound. 
</P>
<P>
 The only comparable recent event featuring local bands was last spring's Beach 
Fest in Long Beach, a two-day affair that offered about 40 bands playing on 
five stages. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't remember any monster concert of this proportion," said Jim Kaa, who 
has been plying the Orange County rock circuit since 1978 as guitarist for the 
Crowd, one of the county's first punk bands. "I've never heard of one where 
they're trying to do (so many) bands" on multiple stages. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pure logistics -- that to me is more frightening than anything. I am not 
personally sure how it is all going to work out," Kaa said. "But we're always 
up for playing, and we look at this as an opportunity to play for a lot of 
people who are not familiar with us from the old days." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the bands appearing at Independent's Day: One Hit Wonder, one of the 
area's best punk-pop bands; the Crowd, China White, Shattered Faith and the 
Adz, which all hark back to the early days of the Orange County punk scene that 
has gained national notice with this year's hit breakthrough by the Offspring; 
the Skeletones, a popular ska-rock band from Riverside; roots-rock contenders 
Mystery Train, blues-rockers Cisco Poison, led by former T.S.O.L. front man Joe 
Wood, and Fuel, featuring Social Distortion members Dennis Danell and John 
Maurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the bands are from Orange County and Long Beach; also represented are 
Riverside, San Diego, Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. The long-running Nevada 
punk band 7 Seconds is the only act on the bill not based in Southern 
California. 
</P>

Meadows Amphitheatre, 8800 Irvine Center Drive, Irvine. $20 at the door, $15 in

GETTING WITH HIS PROGRAM; DANCER JULIO BOCCA WANTS BALLET ARGENTINO TO COVER 
NEW GROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ballet firebrand Julio Bocca bursts onstage like a lightning bolt. He enters a 
room, however, like it's a library. 
</P>
<P>
 An international dance celebrity known for virtuosic bravura, the soft-spoken 
Argentine is self-effacing, almost shy in person. And the reason he formed his 
own troupe, which will dance seven shows at the Cerritos Center for the 
Performing Arts beginning Monday, seems to reflect the same lack of egotism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to give the young people of Argentina the chance to dance," says 
Bocca, who will star with his 14-member ensemble, Ballet Argentino, in short 
classical and modern works. The Buenos Aires-based troupe, most of its 
rank-and-file under 20, was scheduled to make its U.S. debut Friday in 
LasVegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Bocca was 18 when he won the gold medal at the prestigious Fifth International 
Ballet Competition in Moscow. A year later, he became the youngest principal 
dancer ever hired by American Ballet Theatre and made his North American debut 
with ABT at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in December,1986. 
</P>
<P>
 About four years ago, while making guest appearances around the world and 
performing in ABT's New York season (as he still does today), he formed Ballet 
Argentino with compatriot Eleonora Cassano, his partner in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair, last seen in Southern California in a 1992 guest performance at the 
Hollywood Bowl, were former principals with the Teatro Colon Opera Ballet of 
Buenos Aires. Here they will dance lead roles in the program, including "Don 
Quixote" and "Raymonda" pas de deux. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking all-American in a baseball cap, T-shirt, baggy sweats and clunky 
Adidas running shoes, the boyish 27-year-old said in a recent interview at the 
Cerritos center that their friendship strengthened their stage rapport. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes we look at each other on stage," he said, "and we know what the 
other one will do next. That's one of the most important things to dancing 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Bocca drafted his troupe's artistic director, Lidia Segnis -- the former 
dancer runs things so that Bocca can keep other commitments -- and many of his 
dancers from the Colon Opera Ballet, which he said does not give members many 
touring opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big company and it's not too easy to take around the world," he said. 
Conversely, Ballet Argentino has toured Europe, Russia, South and Central 
America and Mexico. "It's nice to travel with people who speak my language and 
to see the young dancers' faces when they go to other places for the first 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some works Bocca has chosen for the troupe are pyrotechnic showstoppers, such 
as the "Don Quixote" pas de deux, that he often performs on guest stints. 
However Ballet Argentino's versions are more involved than most, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 'Don Quixote,' for instance, we do some of the first act, (Cassano's) 
entrance and my little entrance with a guitar and a little mime, and we have 
two girlfriends doing little solos. It is not just the grand pas de deux. 
Sometimes, with these pas de deux, you are so concentrated, you want to do so 
many pirouettes, the huge jumps, that you forget the role." 
</P>
<P>
 He also chooses works that, as company press materials put it, "correspond to 
the temperament of the Argentine people." They include a 35-minute "Carmen" 
choreographed by Albert Alonso, brother of Cuba's ballet doyenne Alicia Alonso, 
and "Tangos," based on the suavely sensual couple's dance born in Buenos Aires' 
brothels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tangos" includes choreography by Juan Carlos Copes, a dancer and 
choreographer with "Tango Argentino," a touring revue seen in Southern 
California in 1986 and '87. 
</P>
<P>
 "Copes once said if you put the tango jacket, hat and pants on any (Argentine) 
boy you find on the street, he can dance the tango," Bocca said. "It's 
something we have inside. You know, like Americans have an American style; 
Argentines have their own kind of spirit and movement." 
</P>
<P>
 The late Argentine composer Astor Piazzolla, widely known as the master of 
"nuevo tango," wrote half the music for "Dos Mundos" ("Two Worlds"). Vivaldi's 
"Four Seasons" makes up the other half of the score to this ballet, which 
unites contemporary Latin culture and "old European culture," Bocca said. 
</P>
<P>
 Julio Lopez, another Colon Opera Ballet alum, choreographed the piece, which 
is one of the troupe's most modern works. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, I said: 'I do only classical ballet, I don't do modern; modern is not 
ballet.' Many classical dancers think that way," Bocca explained. "But people 
mature, and now I understand that ballet is only one way." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bocca compares his fame in Argentina to that of soccer superstar Diego 
Maradona (whom many Americans know mainly as the player expelled from this 
summer's World Cup for drug use). At home, he's regularly mobbed by autograph 
hounds, most of them young women who go gaga over him. But while he has earned 
a reputation abroad, he still doesn't have the name recognition of Baryshnikov, 
for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why this tour is only a month," Bocca said. "Maybe it won't be a 
success, but you know, we wanted to test the water." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Bocca has no doubts about a long and fruitful life for Ballet 
Argentino. 
</P>
<P>
 "My idea is to stop performing when I'm 40," he said, "and maybe then I will 
direct the company and spend a little more time with the dancers, coaching and 
all that." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been working very hard for 12 years to get a name, to get a position 
around the world, so now, for the rest of my career, I just want to enjoy it. 
Now I do the things I really like to do. If there's something I don't like, I 
just don't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 * Julio Bocca and Ballet Argentino perform Monday through Saturday at 8 p.m. 
and Sunday, Oct. 30, at 7 p.m. at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts, 
12700 Center Court Drive, Cerritos. $20-$35. (310) 916-8500.

THEATER REVIEW; 'LYSISTRATA': BAWDY BATTLE OF THE SEXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lysistrata was sort of the Germaine Greer of ancient Greece. 
</P>
<P>
 If you think that stretch is too great, you can have your eyes opened by 
Douglass Parker's very modern 1960s adaptation of Aristophanes' classic Greek 
comedy, brought even more up-to-date by director Thomas F. Bradac in his 
high-camp production at Chapman University's Waltmar Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the brief plot even briefer for newcomers, Lysistrata decides that she 
and her Athenian sisters, along with the women of enemy Sparta, could solve all 
their problems by ending the Second Peloponnesian War simply by refusing to 
have sex with their husbands and lovers until a treaty is signed. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Aristophanes brings contemporary political satire into his raucous 
comedy, but the ladies' refusal of the increasingly randy advances of the men 
is the whole point of the piece. The play, and this production, makes the most 
of all the various and deviant possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradac has staged a show that some might consider rather indifferent 
Aristophanes, but it certainly is top-notch Grecian farce. Bradac's 
free-for-all not only speaks its anti-war subtext, but it shouts feminism in 
today's argot. 
</P>
<P>
 The male chorus counts off its poetry in military cadence; the women render 
theirs as team cheers. The Spartans are "Hee-Haw" country types, and the 
Athenians, under their togas, wear high heels and combat boots. Phallic symbols 
(and some not so symbolic) are the secret weapons of the warriors who can't go 
on fighting without some loving, and the secret weapons the women use to calm 
their ardor are body-size condoms, from which the men shrink in terror. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's never been a play, and is less so here, that requires deep 
characterization. The comic ability is tested, and even actors without much 
flair are so caught up in the fun their gaiety becomes infectious. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Maher is a strong Lysistrata, attractive but able to let herself 
forget the fact to get a laugh. The snooty facade of Anne Marie Nest is just 
right for Lysistrata's friend Kleonike. Deborah Wissink's slinky and bimbo-like 
Myrrhine is delicious, never more so than in the scene where Myrrhine's 
husband, Kinesias (Randy Anderson), thinks he going to be in luck but finds out 
too late that he's not. Wissink and Anderson give authentic burlesque tone and 
energy to a difficult scene. 
</P>
<P>
 April Davis scores as the leader of the female chorus, with a deadpan cool 
that works well, and Christian Denton is very good as the frazzled Commissioner 
who tries to outdo the women and fails. 
</P>
<P>
 The richest comedy is in the hands of Scott Bramble as the leader of the men's 
chorus. Bramble's intuitive timing and sense of reality in the face of 
absurdity is refreshing and always hilarious. 
</P>

NKUMANDA'S SMALL SLICE OF AFRICA; ART: BECAUSE OF THE CLOUD OF APARTHEID, SHE 
NEVER THOUGHT HER WORK WOULD GAIN EXPOSURE SO FAR AWAY, BUT NOW IT IS BEING 
SHOWN IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCILLE RENWICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Monani Jackson Nkumanda's miniature setting rises from the rough canvas with 
all the grit, vibrancy and reality of the lives and landscape he is trying to 
re-create. 
</P>
<P>
 On a 2-by-3-foot masonite board, a dozen wooden and corrugated metal shacks, 
each about 6 inches high, lean at 45-degree angles in the ocher soil. 
</P>
<P>
 In the foreground, a 4-inch hand-carved wooden figurine of a boy juggles a 
soccer ball, while a goat meanders along a road, and a man kneels on the top of 
a shanty frame in mid-swing of driving a nail into a wooden beam. 
</P>
<P>
 It is life in a South African township -- art that until recently has been 
largely cut off from the rest of the world. Even within South Africa, 
Nkumanda's work and those of many other black artists ware known mainly only to 
other black people. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the birth of democracy propelling broad interest in South Africa, 
the work of both blacks and whites there is finding new audiences in the United 
States. At Leslie Sacks Fine Arts Gallery in Brentwood, works by Nkumanda and 
11 other South African artists are being presented in what is being touted as 
the first major exhibit of South African art in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Leslie Sacks, a South African, collected most of the work in "In Full 
Color -- Facets of Contemporary South African Art," over the past decade. A 
portion of the proceeds from works sold from this show -- which range in price 
from $1,200 to $17,000 -- will go to Amnesty International-USA. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing to think of my work being seen overseas," Nkumanda, 46, said in 
a telephone interview from the Cape Town office of a friend. "This is something 
that I never thought would happen, for people so far away, in the United 
States, to see my work." 
</P>
<P>
 Nkumanda, a black South African, came to public attention as apartheid was 
being dismantled and as the white South African art world began to take a 
closer look at work they once regarded as primitive and unsophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were no black formal artists, nothing for us to look to," said Willie 
Bester, one of South Africa's premier black artists who is also included here. 
"If you like these kinds of things you were looked at as abnormal. Art was not 
supposed to be serious for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Nkumanda considered himself a carpenter, but never an artist. The 1979 death 
of a cousin who had encouraged Nkumanda prompted the now 46-year-old to devote 
himself to his art. At that time, he concentrated on working with leather and 
tin. In 1991, after moving near the Guguletu township outside Cape Town, 
Nkumanda focused on capturing his surroundings.

 "I wanted to make the real thing so people could see what really exists here," 
he said. "I'm not a man who can talk and explain, but I can explain with my 
fingertips." 
</P>
<P>
 Built from scraps, his three-dimensional renderings of black South African 
life show the people, shacks, animals, cars and tractors of the townships and 
rural areas.

<P>
 Bester, 38, also uses found objects, which he combines with newspaper 
clippings, photographs and painted images in powerful collage/assemblage pieces 
that carry strong political messages on apartheid and its effects in the 
townships. 
</P>
<P>
 In a piece, titled "Forced Removal" (1991), Bester included newspaper 
headlines about imprisonment, hostels and erupting violence as the backdrop 
behind a haze of blue paint. A bright-yellow bulldozer and a police Jeep sit 
square in the middle of the scene as life continues around them. 
</P>
<P>
 As the bulldozer scoops up a mound of trash on one side, a black police 
officer sitting on the Jeep surveys a woman washing clothes off to the other 
side. Just below the Jeep is a picture of a police officer raising his billy 
club at a black man who is stumbling backward to escape the oncoming blow. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene harkens back to a 1989 removal of people in George, an area in the 
western Cape, when the former Botha regime often bulldozed townships and 
squatter camps without notice or concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was angry looking at these kinds of things and I saw pictures. So I used my 
work as a tool against apartheid. I didn't care if it matched your curtains or 
not," said Bester, who was the first black to win in South Africa's Cape Town 
Triennale in 1991. His work also won an award at the 1993 Venice Biennale. 
</P>

 "My art was a chance to be heard."

MUSIC REVIEW; VIOLINIST RACHLIN RETURNS TO PAVILION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Breaking violin strings is not always a critical matter -- except during a 
public performance. Young Julian Rachlin broke a string Thursday night in the 
middle of a performance -- to be precise, in the finale of Prokofiev's First 
Violin Concerto, with the Los Angeles Philharmonic behind him and a Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion audience in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Did he tear his abundant 20-year-old hair? Did he suffer a breakdown? Not at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 As smoothly as if he had rehearsed his actions, the Lithuanian-born, 
Vienna-trained Rachlin waited for the next tutti passage, then took two steps 
to his right, exchanged instruments with guest concertmaster Martin Chalifour 
and continued to play, with the elegance of a winning racehorse coming into the 
final stretch. No sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 Admirably, Rachlin's surrounding performance of Prokofiev's cherishable, 
sometimes neglected work went along as effortlessly as his violin exchange. The 
prodigious soloist delivered all the myriad moods, lyrical heights and 
mechanical complexities of the piece in an impassioned flow. Forget that he was 
born in 1974; whatever his age, Rachlin is the real thing: a virtuoso with 
heart and a champion's bearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Music Director Esa-Pekka Salonen, the Philharmonic produced for him a 
collaboration of affection and stylishness. 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra concluded the evening with a solid and serious reading of 
Sibelius' never-fail Fifth Symphony, one characterized more often by a heavy 
directness and massive orchestral choralism than by cool transparency and 
lightened textures. Nevertheless, the large climaxes had to impress. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning, Salonen & Co. repeated (from 11 months ago) Schoenberg's 
Five Pieces, Opus 16, re-achieving the spidery delicacy, handsome detailing and 
emotional pungency one now expects from these exposed challenges, but which are 
not necessarily built into them. 
</P>
<P>
 (Note: The 33-year-old Montreal-born violinist Martin Chalifour, at present 
acting concertmaster of the Cleveland Orchestra, is serving as Philharmonic 
concertmaster this week and next.)

STARRY BRITISH CAST BRINGS SHAKESPEARE TO THE AIRWAVES; RADIO REVIEW: AS PART 
OF THE UK/LA FESTIVAL, KCRW-FM BROADCASTS KENNETH BRANAGH'S PRODUCTIONS OF 
"HAMLET" AND "KING LEAR" TODAY AND SUNDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Most of us have never heard a Shakespeare play broadcast over the radio, let 
alone performed by a celestial gathering of British actors, including Kenneth 
Branagh, Emma Thompson and Sir John Gielgud. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as part of the UK/LA Festival, "Hamlet" and "King Lear," accompanied by 
fuller texts than usually employed in stage and screen adaptations, illuminate 
KCRW-FM (89.9) today and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Both classics, which Branagh produced for the BBC and co-directed with Glyn 
Dearman, achieve what no live or filmed Shakespeare can match: The experience 
not only compels you to imagine your own images but also drowns you, happily, 
in the Bard's rich tide of language. 
</P>
<P>
 The aural sensation, enlivened by such actors as Derek Jacobi, Dame Judi Dench 
and Bob Hoskins, is quite different from merely seeing the plays.  
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing stuffy or waxen about these radio recordings. Branagh and 
Dearman have filled the air with moody music and haunting sound effects -- 
searing rain, moaning winds and clashing sabers. They are creased with screams 
and madness -- as in Branagh's "transformations" and unsettling jibberish as 
the anguished Hamlet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On one level, "Hamlet" and "Lear" make good radio bookends, full as they are 
of "bloody, carnal and unnatural acts." 
</P>
<P>
 But as radio plays, particularly for listeners roughly familiar with the texts 
(the "Hamlet" production is based on the first Folio), the travail in Denmark's 
Elsinore castle is much easier to follow as you settle down and pour yourself a 
cup of tea. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because "Hamlet's" classic dramatic unities of time, place and action 
play much better over the air than the meandering "Lear's" extreme polarities 
and double plot. 
</P>
<P>
 As for real-life drama, Gielgud's King Lear was recorded to mark the actor's 
90th birthday and may well be his final statement on the old king who touches 
greatness after a humiliating banishment. His raspy rages catch the vanity, 
folly and reconciliation of the woeful Lear.  
</P>
<P>
 * "King Lear" airs 1-5 p.m. today on KCRW-FM (89.9); "Hamlet" airs 1-5 p.m. 
Sunday.

TV REVIEW; 'AUTRY OF THE WEST': A PLEASANT NOSTALGIC TRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SCHEIDERER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As part of its weekend Film Preservation Festival, American Movie Classics is 
tipping its 10-gallon hat to cowboy star Gene Autry in the hourlong videography 
"Gene Autry: Melody of the West." 
</P>
<P>
 And a nice piece of nostalgia it is, too. Narrated by singer Johnny Cash, the 
program takes a fond look back at Autry's remarkable life and career, and the 
audiences who took the singing cowboy to their hearts. It's almost a saga. 
</P>
<P>
 Autry was born in 1907 in Tioga, Tex., and was reared in Oklahoma. He 
witnessed firsthand the closing of the Western frontier and even saw some 
outlaws firsthand -- he was robbed at gunpoint while working as a railway 
station clerk. It was on that same job that he was discovered -- by Will 
Rogers, no less. 
</P>
<P>
 Autry began singing cowboy songs on the radio in 1928 and by 1934 had worked 
his way to Hollywood, where he appeared in a Ken Maynard Western. He next 
starred in a Mascot serial, "Phantom Empire," which featured Autry's singing, 
and the rest is movie history.  
</P>
<P>
 He went on to make 58 Westerns at Republic and another 34 at Columbia, starred 
on radio for 16 years and on television for five, and sold more than 50 million 
records, including the second biggest-selling single of all time, "Rudolph the 
Red-Nosed Reindeer." 
</P>
<P>
 "Gene Autry: Melody of the West" does an especially nice job of taking notice 
of some of the people who contributed to his career, including Gail Davis, his 
most frequent leading lady; Smiley Burnette and Pat Buttram, his longtime 
sidekicks; and Yakima Canutt, who performed many of Autry's stunts in the early 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously, there is only one mention of Roy Rogers, the singer who got his 
start in an Autry movie and went on to become the biggest singing cowboy star 
of them all. Nor is there any mention of Autry's business acumen, of the 
broadcasting empire he built, or of his frustrated ownership of the California 
Angels.  
</P>
<P>
 But maybe his younger fans would regard that as soft stuff, like kissin' the 
pretty girl. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Gene Autry: Melody of the West" airs at 10:30 a.m. and 7:30 p.m. Sunday on 
cable's AMC channel. The morning showing will be preceded by screenings of 
Autry's only two color Westerns: "The Big Sombrero" at 7:30 a.m. and 
"Strawberry Roan" at 9 a.m.

10,000 TEACHERS WOULD LOSE JOBS UNDER PROP. 187, DISTRICT SAYS; EDUCATION: 
ENFORCEMENT OF INITIATIVE MIGHT RESULT IN CLOSURE OF BIRMINGHAM HIGH, SLAVKIN 
SAYS. LAUSD'S PROJECTED LOSSES ARE RAISED TO $628 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Los Angeles Unified School District officials predicted Friday that 10,000 
teachers would lose their jobs and some campuses would be closed if Proposition 
187 passes and is enforced.  
</P>
<P>
 Board of Education President Mark Slavkin warned that schools and students 
throughout the sprawling district would be affected by the passage of 
Proposition 187 and that the system stands to lose up to $628 million in 
federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very real for all students," Slavkin said. "Citizen children . . . 
will be hurt by a loss of funds. There is no surplus, no savings, no extra 
money generated for schools to use." 
</P>
<P>
 The ballot measure would deny many public services, including education and 
non-emergency medical care, to illegal immigrants. While school officials said 
they are unsure how many of the district's 636,400 students are undocumented, 
Slavkin said the number could be as high as 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The U. S. Department of Education has threatened to withhold funds from state 
school districts if the measure is approved because it would require officials 
to violate federal privacy laws. 
</P>
<P>
 An Education Department spokeswoman said Friday that she does not know when 
the money would be withheld and that questions remain about how students' 
immigration status would be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the measure, schools would be required to verify students' legal status 
and ultimately to report illegal students and their parents to authorities. The 
Board of Education has voted to oppose the measure and expects to join in legal 
challenges if it is approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of Proposition 187 said they believe the measure would save the 
school system money because there would be fewer students to educate. They 
dispute the district's figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "More political rhetoric," said Ron Prince, the Orange County-based campaign 
chairman. "The state of California is not going to lose any federal funds. . . 
. Any conflict will be resolved by the courts." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Slavkin estimated district losses at $450 million in federal 
funding. But at the Friday news conference at Hazeltine Avenue Elementary 
School in Van Nuys, he said a closer analysis has raised the projection to $628 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavkin predicted that campuses on the Westside and in the San Fernando Valley 
would be likely targets for closure. Many of these schools receive students 
from overcrowded campuses in heavily immigrant neighborhoods and are more 
likely to be undocumented, officials explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham High School in Van Nuys, for instance, has just 954 students living 
in the area, while another 1,510 are bused, Slavkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be very difficult to keep Birmingham open if the out-of-area 
students are lost to the school," Slavkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not known which campuses would face potential closure, district 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $628 million in estimated federal funds is spread over a variety of 
accounts, including $166 million for cafeteria services and $132 million in 
so-called compensatory education money used to aid mostly poor, minority 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds are distributed to about 400 of the district's 650 campuses, and 
schools are able to spend the money on programs to help disadvantaged students. 
At Hazeltine, for example, the money has been used for a computer lab, among 
other things. 
</P>
<P>
 The money also pays the salaries of the 10,000 teachers who could lose their 
jobs under the measure, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials added that the federal funds do not cover the costs of all their 
programs for needy students. The district spends nearly $200 million of its 
general fund money to help pay for programs such as special education and 
bilingual classes. 
</P>
<P>
 They argue that even if there are no undocumented students in the district, 
there will still be poor and disadvantaged students to educate. But with 
federal funds cut off, they will have to rely even more heavily on their 
general fund for special programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not fully compensated, but $628 million helps," Slavkin said. "Without 
federal funds, I think we'd be worse off." Federal Fund Cutoff Threatened 
</P>
<P>
 The following San Fernando Valley public schools stand to lose hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in compensatory education funds if Proposition 187 is 
approved and implemented, according to the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
The U. S. Department of Education has said it would withhold funding from 
school districts in the state because it believes that the measure is 
unconstitutional. The compensatory funds are used on a discretionary basis by 
schools to pay for programs and salaries to support mostly poor and 
disadvantaged students.

CANOGA PARK MAN ARRESTED IN DEATH OF INFANT DAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of investigation, Los Angeles police on Friday arrested a Canoga 
Park man with a history of domestic violence on suspicion of murdering his 
infant daughter last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4-month-old girl, Kryistal Marie Don, was pronounced dead on St. Patrick's 
Day after her 11-year-old baby-sitter found her unresponsive and called 
paramedics, according to the baby's mother. 
</P>
<P>
 A coroner's report concluded that the death, initially believed by hospital 
workers to be a case of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, was actually caused by 
cerebral trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, two detectives from a Los Angeles Police Department child-abuse 
unit went to the family's Sherman Way apartment and arrested 25-year-old John 
Don on suspicion of murder. Don, a security guard, was taken to Van Nuys Jail, 
where he was being held in lieu of $1-million bail. He is scheduled for 
arraignment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrest culminated months of lengthy and repeated interviews with Don, his 
24-year-old wife, Jackie Ramsey, and the unidentified baby-sitter, all of whom 
had access to Kryistal before her death, according to Ramsey and a minister for 
the family, Tony Jackson of the Woodland Hills Neighborhood Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Both parents and the sitter submitted teeth imprints to be compared with an 
alleged bite mark on the baby's buttocks, and the parents also took lie 
detector tests, Ramsey and Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, an assistant pastor at the evangelical Neighborhood Church, said the 
impoverished couple -- who have two other children, ages 3 and nearly 5 -- were 
targeted for intense scrutiny by detectives because of Don's two misdemeanor 
convictions for spousal abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said he believes that if the couple could have afforded an attorney, 
police would have left them to their grief long ago. The minister added he also 
believed that Don, whom he described as a born-again Christian and a recovering 
alcoholic, had abandoned his violent behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe he's reformed in a sense that he is no longer acting out the kinds 
of behavior that he exhibited before he committed his life to Christ," Jackson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson also said he believed that police had arrested Don not because they 
had hard evidence he killed his daughter, but in the hopes of extracting a 
confession. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're strong-arming him," said Jackson, who has helped Don hire 
defense lawyer Dean Masserman of Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives on the case could not be reached Friday to comment on Jackson's 
charges. But another knowledgeable source who asked not to be identified said 
it had been an especially tough case to crack. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only was the baby with its parents and the sitter the day she died, but 
there were also signs of prior abuse, including the alleged bite mark on her 
buttocks and bruises on her scalp, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating the investigation was that Ramsey failed a lie detector test 
while Don, the prime suspect, passed, the source said. The mark on the child's 
buttocks also did not match the father's teeth but seemed closer in size to the 
mother's or baby-sitter's, the source said, adding that the father was 
nonetheless the key suspect because of his history of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a poor little kid who didn't have a good life, and I think the LAPD 
feels very badly about it. . . . It's been very frustrating to them," the 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
 It has also been frustrating for the parents, according to Jackson, who 
described repeated interrogations, threats of arrest and attempts to bully the 
husband and wife into turning each other in. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramsey blamed the "crescent-shaped bruise" on her daughter's buttocks on a 
paramedic's efforts to revive her. She said police harassed her in recent 
months by phoning and saying her husband had been arrested when he had not. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramsey also said that even though her husband has been jailed twice for 
beating her -- the most recent incident when she was pregnant with Kryistal -- 
she believes he is innocent of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't do it. . . . I know he didn't," Ramsey said. "He wouldn't let 
anybody near his daughter with a 10-foot pole. He loved her too much."

POLICE IN VAN NUYS GET HIGH-TECH ASSISTANCE; LAW ENFORCEMENT: LAPD DIVISION 
GETS FIRST OF FIVE NIGHT-VISION SCOPES, THE SAME TYPE USED BY MILITARY IN 
PERSIAN GULF WAR. 
</P>

<P>
 For decades, darkness has been a faithful accomplice to the gang members on 
Blythe Street in Panorama City, cloaking their drug deals and drive-by 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Friday, Los Angeles police acquired the ability to pierce the veil with 
a new, high-tech weapon developed for a battlefield of a different sort. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of five Night Enforcer 250 night-vision scopes -- utilizing the same 
technology widely employed by the military in the Persian Gulf War and 
elsewhere in recent years -- were donated to the Los Angeles Police Department 
by ITT Gilfillan of Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the problems has been that (gang members) have seen us before we see 
them," said police Capt. James McMurray of the department's Van Nuys Division, 
which received the first scope. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we just changed the balance." 
</P>
<P>
 Allowing for observation in near-total darkness, the scopes have been used in 
police work throughout the country -- this summer a pair was used by the Police 
Department's Devonshire Division to track and eventually capture a pair of 
suspected rapists in Chatsworth Park. 
</P>
<P>
 But the donation to the Van Nuys Division marks a new effort to phase these 
devices into the everyday arsenal of local law enforcement. The company asked 
Rep. Howard Berman (D-Panorama City) to choose the law enforcement agency to 
receive the first donated scope, and he picked the department's Van Nuys 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next month, four more units will be donated to Los Angeles-area law 
enforcement agencies, including at least two more to the Los Angeles Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the devices give an obvious surveillance advantage to undercover vice 
officers, beat officers also hope they will help protect the lives of those 
chasing suspects at night or performing search-and-rescue operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can remember being on building searches and the room is dark as can be and 
you don't want to turn on a light so the suspect can see you," Officer Ron 
Carpenter of the Van Nuys Division said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Carpenter and McMurray spent Friday at a press conference at the ITT 
facility, where lights were clicked off in a room to demonstrate the device -- 
handicapping the television camera operators who bumped about seeking footage 
in the near-total darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 The 26-ounce scope converts available dim light -- such as starlight -- into 
electrical energy, boosts it electronically and then converts the energy into 
ghostly greenish-white images. Using the scope, a six-foot-tall man could be 
spotted on a moonless night at a distance of 125 yards, the manufacturer says. 
</P>
<P>
 At a cost of $2,400 apiece, the night-vision scopes have been widely used by 
the military -- including operations in Kuwait, Iraq, Grenada and Panama -- and 
only recently have been redesigned to meet the needs of local law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Devonshire Division Detective Debra Kirk is one of those who has already 
reaped the benefits of the scope. In July, she and a fellow detective used a 
device purchased for police by a local support group -- previously, the only 
such scope in the Police Department -- to stake out Chatsworth Park North, 
where two rapes were reported within a week of each other. 
</P>
<P>
 After a volunteer surveillance team spotted two suspects moving into the park 
at night, the two detectives watched the men engage in suspicious activity that 
would have been impossible to spot without the scopes, Kirk said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The park is completely dark where the rapes were occurring," Kirk said. "The 
use of the night vision goggles was invaluable in the apprehension of the 
suspects." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, police arrested Francisco Javier Ochoa and Jose Abran Umanzor, 
both 21, of Canoga Park. Both are awaiting trial, Kirk said. 
</P>
<P>
 ITT has also donated the scopes to the New York Police Department and other 
law enforcement agencies with the hope that they will buy more once they see 
the benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Robert Welsh of the Ohio Highway Patrol said in an interview that his 
agency used the scopes to help suppress the 1993 uprising at the Southern Ohio 
Correctional Facility, where officers used the scopes to find convicts hiding 
in darkened tunnels dug underneath the prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could use the scopes to figure out where they were without having to go in 
and get hit on the head by them," Welsh said. "It helps to do things covertly." 
</P>
<P>
 With all the uses for the night scopes, McMurray says demand to use them is 
high at the Van Nuys Division. Although his anti-gang unit is already eager to 
be the first, he said he will allow other police units to conduct test runs 
with the device during the next month. 
</P>
<P>
 But he does expect to see one thing with the night-vision scope right away, no 
matter who is using it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you're probably going to see some arrests very soon," he said.

EXPANDING THEIR UNIVERSE; GRIFFITH OBSERVATORY PLANS $25-MILLION UNDERGROUND 
EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After 60 years of looking to the skies, operators of Los Angeles' landmark 
Griffith Observatory have decided that their future is beneath the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 That is where they want to build a huge exhibition hall and education center 
that will more than double the size of the ridge-top observatory -- and is 
expected to force the closure of the facility to the public for up to a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The subterranean construction -- 12 feet beneath the observatory's front lawn 
-- is part of a proposed $25-million expansion that includes redesign of the 
facility's famed planetarium and installation of new, computerized star 
projectors. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials will meet Monday to pick an architectural firm to design the 
35,000-square-foot addition and manage its construction, which is expected to 
start in about 2 1/2 years, said Ed Krupp, observatory director. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials predict that it will take until then to draw plans for the 
subterranean hall, select a contractor and have a handmade, $3-million 
planetarium projector built. 
</P>
<P>
 The huge construction project will force observatory operators to shutter 
telescopes and fence off observatory grounds that draw nearly 2 million 
visitors a year. Thousands more come to look at the stunning view of Los 
Angeles below. About 40% of those visiting the planetarium pay to see 
"Laserium," a privately run rock music laser show that will also close when 
construction starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say they hope to operate temporary stargazing exhibits or send 
smaller mobile telescopes to schools during construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion is the first for the observatory since it was built in 1934 with 
a $750,000 trust willed to the city by Col. Griffith J. Griffith. He was a 
mining and real estate speculator who donated Griffith Park to the city in 
1896. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say they have decided to go underground to avoid tampering with the 
observatory's Art Deco look or ruining its eye-catching, three-dome profile on 
the hillside beneath the Hollywood sign. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more expensive, but it seems to be the best way not to affect the 
character or appearance of this building," said Krupp, an Eagle Rock resident 
who is the observatory's fifth director. 
</P>
<P>
 "The architecture of the observatory is too precious to compromise. This place 
looks like an observatory. You have domes, a hillside location, grand 
architecture. It says you're in a different environment up here." 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion will be financed primarily by an $18-million share of a ballot 
measure approved in 1992 by county voters for parks projects. Another $1 
million will come from observatory funds saved in recent years. Observatory 
supporters hope to raise the remaining $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say the observatory has changed little since it opened May 14, 1935, 
overlooking a city that then had a population of about 1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the seventh most popular tourist attraction in the Los Angeles area, 
yet we're the size of a postage stamp," Krupp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial plans call for the underground hall to have space for new astronomical 
exhibits, a restaurant that will replace the concrete-block snack bar 
aboveground, a bookstore and gift shop, classrooms and a small auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 The subterranean expansion will feature a curving "entry plaza" that opens to 
the ground next to the observatory parking lot. Stairs and elevators will link 
the entry level with a new front lawn planted above the underground hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The 37-foot Astronomers Monument featuring Galileo and five other early 
stargazers will be removed during construction and reinstalled later. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for some repairs to its rooftop visitors deck, the observatory's 
original poured-concrete exterior will remain untouched. Three copper-topped 
domes over the observatory's 12-inch refractor telescope, the planetarium and 
the solar telescope were refurbished 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The observatory's interior will be extensively renovated, however. Restrooms 
will be added, wheelchair facilities will be installed, worn marble flooring 
will be replaced in the foyer, and frescoes and murals by artist Hugo Ballin 
will be cleaned and repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 The 648-seat planetarium will be redesigned. The proposal calls for seating to 
be reduced to about 350 so a stage can be built on the circular theater's south 
side. 
</P>
<P>
 A new 75-foot-wide curved ceiling made from perforated aluminum will replace 
the existing plaster dome. A hydraulic lift system that can lower the star 
projector out of sight when it's not being used will be installed in the center 
of the seating area. 
</P>
<P>
 The current projector, a 30-year-old Zeiss model that can project 6,500 stars 
and nine planets on the ceiling, will be replaced with a computerized version. 
Officials say the old projector -- which they admit resembles "a giant ant with 
a thyroid condition" -- will be put on display in the new underground exhibit 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are also considering buying a second projector, a 
television-scanning device that can digitally depict the edge of the galaxy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The changes are long overdue, according to those involved in the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the observatory is to continue Col. Griffith's mission in teaching science 
and astronomy, it's going to have to keep pace," said Winston Bowen, a retired 
Silver Lake marketing manager who heads the 950-member Friends of Griffith 
Observatory group. His organization will try to raise the $6 million needed for 
the expansion project. 
</P>
<P>
 The six design finalists scheduled to be interviewed Monday by a screening 
committee were chosen from a field of 16 firms. City parks commissioners are 
expected to vote Thursday on hiring one. Bowen said all six have a keen 
interest in preserving the look of the observatory. He said that means "there 
is very little possibility anyone will be disappointed with the outcome." 
</P>
<P>
 Others are skeptical, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Kishbaugh, president of a coalition of 55 Los Angeles-area homeowners 
groups called the Federation of Hillside and Canyon Assns., complained that 
city officials are "trying to compete with Universal Studios" by creating a new 
tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people don't know how to leave well enough alone," said Kishbaugh, a 
writer who lives in Laurel Canyon. "I believe they'll make hash out of the site 
up there. They're the kind of people who add four more ingredients to the 
bouillabaisse and ruin it." 
</P>
<P>
 Parks officials say additional work may be needed at the observatory in the 
future. Parking problems might require eventual development of a 600-space 
underground parking structure or a 650-space parking structure at the nearby 
Greek Theatre that would be linked to the observatory by a hill-climbing 
funicular. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimated cost of those proposals ranges from an additional $10 million to 
$24 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Those facilities are not included in the upcoming project, according to Frank 
Catania, director of planning and development for the city parks department.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; THE GALLERIA'S PARKING LOT REOPENS SOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ten months after the Northridge earthquake virtually destroyed it, a 
1,500-space parking structure has been rebuilt to reopen Nov. 15, in time for 
the holiday shopping crush. 
</P>
<P>
 Three sections of the garage on the Galleria's west side, between the Broadway 
department store and the mall's food court, were razed in August. Mall 
officials said it has taken 33,000 tons of concrete, 260 miles of steel beams, 
135 workers on a fast-track construction schedule and $12 million -- partly 
funded by the city -- to rebuild them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking forward to reopening the structure and getting back to normal," 
said Melissa Beissner, a mall spokeswoman. "We've been fortunate to have the 
cooperation of the city since the earthquake. In spite of the parking situation 
this has been a good year." 
</P>
<P>
 When the garage was first closed in January, area streets were jammed on 
weekends as customers searched for parking. Shortly thereafter, several 
city-owned vacant lots across the street from the mall on Central Avenue were 
paved for temporary parking lots.  
</P>
<P>
 In the meanwhile, the Glendale Associates Limited Partnership, which owns that 
part of the mall, searched for an economical way to rebuild the structure, 
officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 The partnership, headed by developer Donahue Schriber, also includes the 
Broadway, J. C. Penney and Robinsons-May department stores and city's 
redevelopment agency. They eventually asked the city for help getting a 
low-interest federal loan to pay a $4.5-million insurance deductible on the 
garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Derrill Quaschnick, the city's assistant redevelopment director, said the 
redevelopment agency agreed to pay back about one-fifth of the loan, or about 
$1 million, because it is one of the five partners. The city will also use 
reserve funds to guarantee repayment of the loan, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally under this federal program the city's (community development) block 
grant monies act as a guarantee for the loan, but we did not want the city's 
block grant programs to be perceived in any way to be in jeopardy," Quaschnick 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 City finance records show that the Galleria did about $37 million in business 
during the first three months of the year, roughly the same as it did during 
the same period of 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 Mall officials say that's no mean feat, since parking was at a premium. They 
also said business increased during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales were probably helped by the fact that several malls in the San Fernando 
Valley were severely damaged by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Areas like Glendale benefited from the quake because people realized how 
addicted they'd become to shopping and they were willing to travel," said Bob 
Scott, past president of the United Chambers of Commerce of the San Fernando 
Valley. But the boom is probably over, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that the Valley malls are reopening, people are coming back to them with 
a vengeance," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 City and mall officials are optimistic about the holiday season at the 
Galleria, but they said the mall's parking problems are not entirely over. 
</P>
<P>
 Quaschnick said the city and mall will decide next year whether it is more 
economical to upgrade that section of the garage to current quake standards, or 
to raze and rebuild it. STEVE RYFLE

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; LATINO STUDENTS GET A JOLT OUT OF SCIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It took a few hits of helium, some magnets and a minor earthquake to get their 
attention, but in the end, the thrill of science triumphed over the 
distractions assaulting the minds of sixth-graders visiting Cal State 
Northridge on Friday for Science Day '94. 
</P>
<P>
 The visit, sponsored by the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, gave 
many of the 400 Latino students their first look at a state university.  
</P>
<P>
 The students seemed awed by the computer rooms, the lecture halls, the 
dormitories, the library and the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "This place is a lot bigger than I thought it would be," said Mirna Bermudez, 
a sixth-grader from Pacoima. "I also thought it would be a lot more boring," 
she said, taking a break from a bubble-blowing experiment that had been set up 
by Rocketdyne scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Ornelas, a classmate of Mirna's, plans to become a doctor. He said he 
knew long before Science Day that he'd have to study biology and chemistry. But 
he admitted he had never known what a university looked like. "I came in and I 
saw all the cars and all the tables (in the cafeteria) and doors to the 
classes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I want to come here. Or UCLA." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerardo Garcia first proposed the event to school officials in 1986 when he 
was an engineering student at the university. "After I got here to school, I 
realized a lot of my friends never got the encouragement they needed," said 
Garcia, who grew up in Pacoima and now works at the Naval Air Warfare Center at 
Point Mugu Naval Base. "We never even knew what a university looked like. We 
only knew about the walls of the barrio." 
</P>
<P>
 Funding for the event comes from the Department of Water and Power, The Gas 
Co., and Rockwell International.  
</P>
<P>
 "We look predominantly for classes from Hispanic areas, but we also want 
teachers to bring other kids they know aren't doing well, or maybe they're in 
danger of dropping out," Garcia said. "We want them to know we were just like 
them, but they can change everything if they can just get into school." 
</P>
<P>
 In a steeply sloped lecture hall, CSUN geology Prof. Gerry Simila told the 
students how geologists help explain earthquakes and work with engineers to 
build stronger structures. 
</P>
<P>
 The students looked a little sleepy and fidgety during his slide-show 
presentation, but when Simila asked the audience to jump up and down so he 
could measure the rumbling on his seismograph, the place erupted with joyous 
stomping.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is just what the doctor ordered," said Arnold Rosenthal, a teacher at 
Telfair Avenue Elementary School in Pacoima. "The kids were kind of ambivalent 
about coming here, but look how engrossed they are." TIM MAY

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: BIKERS COMING WITH SIDECARS AS SIDEKICKS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of motorcycle enthusiasts are expected at Travel Town this weekend, 
with half coming along just for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the park's 23rd annual Sidecar Rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Event organizer Doug Bingham expects at least 300 motorcycle sidecars of 
various vintages from as far away as England and Japan. It is the oldest 
sidecar rally in the country and one of the biggest, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In past years, the vehicles on display have run the gamut from specialized 
racing machines to World War II German sidecars -- complete with camouflage 
paint -- as well as examples of the enclosed sidecars that were popular in 
Britain during the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 Plenty of modern sidecars are expected, all attached to motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
 Bingham is bringing one of the custom rigs he built for television crews to 
cover the Olympic marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a Harley-riders-meet-BMW riders-meet-British-riders kind of thing," said 
Bingham, who won a national championship racing sidecars in 1968. "It has 
always been a family-type activity, with the parents riding on the bike and the 
kids riding in the sidecar." 
</P>
<P>
 The main rally and picnic will take place between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. Sunday. 
The Mineral Wells picnic grounds can be reached from the Forest Lawn Drive exit 
from the eastbound Ventura Freeway. DARIN ESPER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; COLLEGE TO OVERHAUL HEATING, LIGHTING 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A total revamping of the heating and lighting systems at Pierce College in 
Woodland Hills was approved by the Los Angeles Community College District board 
this week. The project is expected to start in the spring and take 18 months to 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe it's one of the ways our college will be able to make our 
classrooms a better learning environment," Pierce President Mary Lee said of 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding for the project will come from a long-term loan of nearly $3 million 
in bonds from the state Public Works Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the new systems will be less costly for Pierce to run, the school 
plans to pay back the loan with the money it saves. 
</P>
<P>
 The new heating units to be installed are able to have air conditioning added 
to them easily and inexpensively, officials said. MAKI BECKER

<P>
 More than 100 stolen TVs, VCRs, car stereos and other valuables recovered by 
the Glendale Police Department will be put on display next week for their 
owners to claim. 
</P>
<P>
 From 4 to 6 p.m. Thursday, victims of residential burglaries will have an 
opportunity to look at the items, and if they recognize anything that belongs 
to them, claim their property, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have power tools, cellular phones, all kinds of things. The only thing we 
don't have is jewelry," said Officer Rod Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything listed in the nine-page inventory of items is believed to have been 
stolen between April and August, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Robbery victims must call ahead and register for an appointment, police said, 
and must provide a police report listing the stolen property and a valid ID. 
Because not all the seized property is known to have been stolen in Glendale, 
police will admit burglary victims from other communities as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Appointments will be scheduled in alphabetical order by name to avoid a large 
crowd at the police station, Brooks said. For more information, call (818) 
548-2097. STEVE RYFLE

<TEXT>
<P>
 The American Red Cross is hoping to use a ghoulish holiday to its advantage by 
holding a blood drive and Halloween celebration at the Glendale Adventist 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Donating blood is serious business," said Beth Powis, a spokeswoman for the 
hospital.But the Red Cross is hoping to use the holiday inspire more donations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the Red Cross' idea to hold a drive on Halloween this year," Powis 
said. "They wanted to make it more fun." 
</P>
<P>
 During the blood drive, to be held from 9:45 a.m. to 3 p.m. in the main 
auditorium of the hospital, Red Cross volunteers will be dressed in costume and 
Halloween treats will be given out in place of the traditional cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Red Cross, more than 1,000 people use donated blood every day 
in Los Angeles and Orange counties, but it cannot be stockpiled. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who want to donate must first call HealthMatch at (818) 409-8100 to make 
an appointment, Powis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital is at 1509 Wilson Terrace. ED BOND

 After 12 weeks of workshops in building self-confidence, improving 
communication and learning how to make schools and neighborhoods safer, 13 
participants of the parenting empowerment class offered by Hope in Youth -- a 
countywide gang-prevention and parent involvement program -- will graduate next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope in Youth developed the class, which is offered at more than 40 locations 
in Los Angeles, to form a support network for parents, especially those who are 
recent immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Several teen-agers, also in Hope in Youth, will be recognized for their help

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; SALVATION ARMY TO HONOR QUAKE HEROES

<P>
 The Salvation Army will honor heroes of the Northridge earthquake and update 
Valley residents on services the organization provides during an upcoming open 
house at the San Fernando Valley Corps in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really want everybody to come and see what we've been up to since the 
earthquake," said Mildred Traeger, a spokeswoman for the Salvation Army's Adult 
Rehabilitation Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Billed as a family event, the open house will be held from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
Oct. 29 and will feature food, music, games, door prizes and a photography 
exhibit of earthquake rescue efforts as well as a pictorial history of the 
Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
 A program honoring those who labored above the call of duty to help others 
during the earthquake will be held at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those the Salvation Army will recognize include: The Los Angeles 
Police Department and the California National Guard for providing security and 
distribution services; the Department of Water and Power and The Gas Co. for 
providing emergency repairs; McDonald's, Lucky Food Centers and Ralphs Grocery 
stores for providing food and supplies to rescue workers; the American Red 
Cross for providing first aid, and Eddie Chu of Devonshire Mobile Car Care 
Center, who also provided food for those in need. 
</P>
<P>
 Traeger said she hopes the open house will spotlight services the Salvation 
Army provides to the public, including programs like the Adult Rehabilitation 
Center. The center is a comprehensive residential drug and alcohol abuse 
treatment center that can accommodate up to 86 adults free of charge. It serves 
the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an incredible facility where people go who really want to help 
themselves get better," Traeger said. TIM MAY

GUNMAN WHO KILLED GIRL, 16, IN CROSS-FIRE IS SENTENCED; COURTS: HE AND AN 
ACCOMPLICE, CALLED GANG 'WANNA-BES,' RECEIVE UP TO LIFE IN PRISON AFTER PLEA 
FROM VICTIM'S MOTHER. THEIR FATHERS APOLOGIZE IN COURT.

<P>
 Following pleas from the mother, sister and brother of a 16-year-old girl who 
was killed in the cross-fire of a shooting near Cleveland High School, the man 
who fired the fatal shot was sentenced Friday to 29 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar Alberto Prado, 20, of Northridge was sentenced for second-degree murder 
in the death of Rocio Delgado, who had been walking home from the Reseda 
school. Authorities called the shooting a gang-related incident. 
</P>
<P>
 His accomplice, Aureliano Vasquez, 19, of Reseda was sentenced to 16 years to 
life in prison. Both Prado and Vasquez were also convicted of attempted murder 
and two counts of assault with a deadly weapon for the gunshot wounding of a 
17-year-old girl who was near Delgado and the wounding of a 16-year-old boy, 
whom the two men were chasing. The two men also beat up a 15-year-old boy with 
a pipe. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando Superior Court Judge Shari Kreissler Silver ruled the two men 
could serve the first few years of their sentence in a California Youth 
Authority facility to take advantage of the educational programs offered there. 
</P>
<P>
 "This crime is outrageous and caused unbelievable suffering, but I do believe 
that educational programs for a limited time will be beneficial," she said. 
"They are both still going to be spending a long time in custody." 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez's attorney, Ira Saltzman, had argued for a lesser sentence because his 
client did not fire any shots. Prado's attorneys, Jonathan G. Ash and Norman L. 
Goodfriend, also argued for leniency, arguing that their client was a 
"follower, not a leader," and that he fired the gun only because he thought he 
was about to be attacked with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. John F. Nantroup Jr. had sought a maximum sentence of 35 
years to life for Prado and 27 years to life for Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
 The fathers of both men apologized to the Delgado family, and said their sons 
were not bad but deserved punishment for their actions. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim's mother, Inocencia Diaz, told the judge her daughter had been 
hospitalized from the ages of 2 to 6.  
</P>
<P>
 "I thanked God when he didn't take her away from me," Diaz said through a 
Spanish interpreter. "These murderers don't know what they have taken away from 
me. They have taken her life and my life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their families are asking you to return them to them, but who will return my 
daughter to me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Although the boys the two men attacked were gang members, during the trial it 
was determined that Vasquez and Prado were not in a gang, but rather "wanna-be" 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 The Feb. 22 incident began shortly after 3 p.m. when Vasquez, Prado and two 
brothers -- Edward and George Torres -- were driving near Cleveland High School 
allegedly looking for a fight with members of the Blythe Street gang. 
</P>
<P>
 They spotted a 15-year-old boy and asked him where he was from. When he 
responded Blythe Street, three of the four got out of the car and began beating 
him. When a friend of the 15-year-old ran to help, George Torres allegedly 
pulled a gun from the car. 
</P>
<P>
 When George Torres could not release the safety on the gun, Prado asked for 
the weapon, released the safety and then began shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Torres brothers, who were 16 and 17 at the time of the shooting, are being 
tried as adults on similar charges. Their trial is pending.

NO JOKE; TELEVISION: CADRE OF MINORITY COMEDIANS GATHER OUTSIDE NBC STUDIOS TO 
DECRY LACK OF EXPOSURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Knock, knock. Who's there? 
</P>
<P>
 Two-dozen black and Latino comics. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-dozen black and Latino comics who? 
</P>
<P>
 Precisely. 
</P>
<P>
 Chanting "No justice, no jokes!" a cadre of minority comedians gathered 
outside NBC Studios Friday night, decrying what they called their lack of 
exposure on "The Tonight Show" -- and on television in general. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more dinosaurs and extraterrestrials on television than Latinos," 
said writer and stand-up comic Rick Najera. 
</P>
<P>
 Clad in black Halloween masks and schnoz-and-mustache glasses -- and firing 
off one-liners that were part social commentary and part 
a-duck-walks-into-a-bar humor -- the protesters surprised "Tonight Show" 
audience members leaving a just-completed taping of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 They were quick to point out in interviews that they weren't necessarily 
blaming "Tonight Show" host Jay Leno personally. 
</P>
<P>
 But, they said, ever since Johnny Carson left the show, the number of new 
minority comics appearing on it has dropped considerably. 
</P>
<P>
 According to protest organizer Gene Pompa, of the 70 comics who made their 
"Tonight Show" debuts after Leno took over, none were Latino and only three 
were black. 
</P>
<P>
 Pompa, who said he had spoken to a receptive Leno earlier in the day about 
their concerns, said the problem appeared to arise from new methods of choosing 
talent for the show as opposed to a deliberate effort to reduce the number of 
minority guests. The show no longer holds showcases for undiscovered comedians, 
which under Carson was the primary way for ethnic performers to audition, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC officials declined to comment on the protest. One company spokeswoman, 
however, said disabled, openly gay, minority and female comics had all appeared 
on Leno's show. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Tonight Show" was the immediate target of the protest but, comics said, 
the problem is pervasive in television. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're a little scared to put us on because they think we'll only 
address one segment of the community," Rene Sandoval said. He said his 
experience before audiences nationwide convinces him he has a broad appeal. 
"I've been in 44 states," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Humor is humor, funny is funny, they said, and if color doesn't matter to 
audiences, why should it to television producers? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been told they wouldn't get it in Reno," Wiley Roberts said. "They got 
it in Reno. I've been told they wouldn't get it in Minnesota. They got it in 
Minnesota."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the message was serious, the messengers were, well, not. At least not 
completely. 
</P>
<P>
 While one placard read "Tonight Show -- no beige comics," another declared 
"Artichokes 3 for $1." And yet another, held aloft by a portly jokester, 
announced, "Lose weight now, ask me how." 
</P>
<P>
 "TV is the last American wasteland!" shouted one man. "We want in on it!" 
</P>
<P>
 Pompa chuckled and shrugged and tried to explain: "We're comics."

BERMAN SEEKS TO SPEED UP REPAIRS IN 'GHOST TOWN'; NORTH HILLS:HE ASKS RIORDAN 
TO CALL A MEETING OF DISASTER OFFICIALS AND PROPERTY OWNERS IN QUAKE-HIT AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Saying that repairs are moving too slowly at a quake-damaged "ghost town" in 
North Hills, Rep. Howard Berman called on Mayor Richard Riordan on Friday to 
convene a meeting of property owners and disaster officials to hasten repairs 
at the vacant buildings, which have become crime magnets. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the mayor, Berman (D-Panorama City) said he is concerned that 
few repairs have begun in the heavily damaged neighborhood while repairs are 
further along in another ghost town in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why are things taking so long in North Hills?" he asked in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 A Riordan spokeswoman said the mayor takes the ghost-town problem seriously 
and believes city agencies are doing their best to hasten repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just can't get results overnight," said Noelia Rodriguez, Riordan's press 
aide. 
</P>
<P>
 The cluster of vacant, crumbling apartment buildings along Orion Avenue and 
Parthenia Street in North Hills have been identified by city housing officials 
as one of 15 "ghost town" clusters created by the Jan. 17 earthquake in the San 
Fernando, Hollywood and Mid-City areas. 
</P>
<P>
 To speed repairs and reduce crime in the areas, city officials have used 
federal emergency dollars to seal off the buildings and hire private, 24-hour 
security patrols for the neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to heavy gang and drug sales problems in the vacant North Hills 
buildings, the city dispatched mounted police patrols in early September. The 
officers continue to be deployed there when available. 
</P>
<P>
 From a bankroll of more than $300 million in federal and local funds, housing 
officials also have offered zero- and low-interest loans to owners of 
quake-damaged apartments, condominiums and single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to Berman's letter, Gary Squier, general manager of the city's 
Housing Department, said his agency already meets regularly with property 
owners and federal disaster officials to try to quickly funnel zero- or 
low-interest loans to landlords in North Hills and other ghost towns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not as if we are just sitting back until someone calls us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Squier added that more North Hills buildings are ending up in foreclosure 
than in any other ghost town in the city. This means repairs are delayed for 
months until new owners take over the properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Other property owners in the North Hills ghost town may be reluctant to accept 
the city's low-interest repair loans because the neighborhood has long been 
plagued by crime and gangs, making it difficult to attract tenants even before 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has just been a very adverse social and economic climate," Squier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Richard Alarcon, who represents the North Hills area, said he and 
Berman "share a lot of the same concerns" about the slow pace of repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 But he put the blame on some landlords who have not taken advantage of the 
city's attractive loan offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite frankly, some of the owners have no intention of making repairs," he 
said.

RELIGION / JOHN DART; CATHOLIC COMMUNICATION GROUP GATHERS TO REWARD MEDIA 
ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A national group of Catholic broadcasters and church communicators will come 
to Universal City next month -- not to bury Hollywood in righteous criticism 
but to praise things of value. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite some dissenters on the Catholic right, that positive-thinking approach 
has characterized most efforts by the local Roman Catholic leadership in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 150 Catholic communications professionals are expected to attend the 
annual meeting at the Sheraton Universal Hotel of Unda-USA Nov. 8 through 11. ( 
Unda is Latin for "wave," as in airwaves). Actress Angela Lansbury, star of the 
long-running television series "Murder, She Wrote," will receive a personal 
achievement award, and three dozen "Gabriel" angel statuettes will be handed 
out to NBC's "Today" show, ABC News and assorted secular and church-related 
productions on radio and television. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to encourage the secular media," said Sister Nancy Kinross of Dayton, 
Ohio, national office coordinator for Unda. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing is perfect. To praise that which is good is important." 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Edward James Olmos will speak and other "value-oriented" industry 
insiders will take part in workshops on the creative process, programming and 
marketing, said Dan Pitre, public relations director for Family Theater 
Productions in Hollywood, which makes Catholic-oriented films. 
</P>
<P>
 Vatican-based Archbishop John Foley, who heads the Pontifical Council for 
Social Communications, will be the luncheon speaker Nov. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cardinal Roger M. Mahony will be in Rome during the conference, the 
Los Angeles prelate helped set the tone of constructive relations with the 
entertainment business with a pastoral letter in 1992, urging creative people 
in films, broadcasting and music to "not pander to baser instincts." 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged that "to combine entertainment and enrichment is a creative 
challenge" but defended the principle of artistic freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because I reject censorship, I do not propose a (production) code to govern 
what film makers may create, nor do I wish to dictate what intelligent viewers 
may see," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier that year, a mistaken impression had emerged that the cardinal favored 
reviving a Hollywood film code, as proposed at a Hollywood seminar by Ted Baehr 
of Atlanta, who edits the religiously conservative Movieguide magazine. The 
previous production code, which died in 1966, was bolstered by the Catholic 
Legion of Decency, Hwhich issued film ratings that exercised a powerful 
influence on Catholic moviegoers from the 1930s to the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahony did not actually favor such an action, however, and later used many 
occasions to reverse that impression. 
</P>
<P>
 His rejection was disappointing to Baehr and Dennis Jarrard of Santa Barbara, 
who then chaired the Los Angeles Archdiocesan Commission on Obscenity and 
Pornography. Their philosophical disagreement with the cardinal showed up last 
month in a full-page ad in the Washington Times, in which Baehr and Jarrard 
criticized Mahony for not doing enough to "help shut off the pollution at its 
source" by pushing for a code to regulate depictions of sex and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Gregory Coiro, a spokesman for Mahony, told the Religious News Service 
then, "It's a fantasy to believe that one man or woman, religious leader or 
not, can influence the film and TV industries to the extent being asked for in 
the ad." 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers at the upcoming Unda conference are not necessarily going to ignore 
Hollywood's alleged moral shortcomings. Sister Elizabeth Thoman, director of 
the Los Angeles-based Center for Media and Values, will lead a workshop on 
violence in the media. Paulist Father Gregory Apparcel of Paulist Pictures in 
Pacific Palisades will talk about "Images of Catholicism in TV and Film." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, said Pitre, Unda does not take a combative stance. 
</P>
<P>
 Thoman's center and its magazine focuses on educating people in using the 
entertainment media intelligently. She does not lead boycotts or petition 
campaigns against offending programs, Pitre said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I think we'll find from Father Apparcel that a lot more programs deal 
with Catholicism and other faiths and morals than people realize," Pitre said. 
</P>
<P>
 A different picture was reported this year by the Media Research Center in 
Alexandria, Va., whose chairman, L. Brent Bozell III, is a conservative 
Catholic critic of the secular media. In 1,000 hours of prime-time television 
programs last year, the issue of religion came up 116 times, according to the 
center's study released in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "When prime-time shows mention or cover religion, they regularly do so 
negatively, portraying religious leaders and religious viewpoints as cold, 
intolerant and oppressive," said Bozell in a news conference in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Bozell will not be part of the Unda meeting. Neither is the independent and 
sometimes controversial Eternal Word Television Network (EWTN), a 
Catholic-oriented cable network based in Birmingham, Ala., that claims an 
audience of 27 million. It is run by an outspoken conservative, Mother 
Angelica. 
</P>
<P>
 "EWTN hasn't shown much interest in our meetings in the last couple of years," 
said Sister Kinross of Unda. 
</P>
<P>
 More representative of Unda's approach is the Nov. 10 luncheon speaker, Ed 
Murray of St. Louis, president of the Catholic Telecasters Group, which 
supplies programs to the interdenominational Faith & Values cable network, 
formerly known as VISN. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nov. 8 conference opening includes a 5:30 p.m. Mass at St. Charles 
Borromeo Church in North Hollywood with Archbishop Foley presiding and 
Auxiliary Bishop Armando X. Ochoa of the San Fernando Pastoral Region giving 
the homily.

PROP. 187 SPARKS MORE STUDENT WALKOUTS IN SOUTHLAND; DEMONSTRATIONS: SEVERAL 
HUNDRED PROTEST AT EL CAMINO HIGH AGAINST IMMIGRATION INITIATIVE. 
</P>

 The wave of high school walkouts in protest of Proposition 187 continued 
throughout Southern California on Friday, and in one case the demonstrations 
turned turbulent, as sheriff's deputies used two non-lethal rubber grenades to 
disperse a crowd of protesters in Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second consecutive Friday marked by student anti-187 
demonstrations. A week before, about 1,500 students from junior and senior high 
schools in Los Angeles and several of its southeastern suburbs left their 
classrooms to demonstrate against the controversial proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 At El Camino Real High School in Woodland Hills, several hundred students 
voiced their opposition to the measure in a morning demonstration. At Jordan 
High in Watts, about 200 students demonstrated in a morning walkout. And about 
300 students walked out of classes at Pacific Palisades and Lincoln high 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure's best-known provisions would bar illegal immigrants from public 
schooling, non-emergency health care and social services. Proponents say the 
measure would help curb continuing, large-scale illegal immigration. Opponents 
consider the measure to be poorly drafted and a xenophobic invitation to harass 
the foreign-born. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified School District officials, who have hired outside counsel 
to advise them on how to deal with the measure if it is approved Nov. 8, said 
they support the students' First Amendment rights to free speech. But they said 
teachers and administrators should encourage students to return to classes to 
avoid being marked truant. 
</P>
<P>
 In Costa Mesa, about 100 students walked out of Estancia High School at about 
1 p.m. Friday and marched peacefully down the street shouting, "Viva la raza!" 
and "Mexico, Mexico, Mexico!" 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 Oxnard students walked out of Rio Mesa High School Friday morning 
and marched several miles toward Oxnard High School, protesting against the 
proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies used "stingball" grenades shortly before 4 p.m. to disperse a crowd 
of 450 to 500 people who gathered at Hunsaker Avenue and Alondra Boulevard in 
Paramount, said Sheriff's Sgt. Ron Spear. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured by the stingballs -- explosive devices that hurl rubber 
pellets meant to inflict pain without injury as a crowd control tactic -- and 
there were no arrests, Spear said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students from Paramount walked out of classes shortly after 9 a.m., deputies 
said, and went to Dominguez High School, about two miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez Principal Fred Easter said the march was peaceful, and deputies had 
the protesters under surveillance. The marchers walked from the Dominguez 
campus to Jordan High School in Long Beach, and returned to Dominguez at lunch 
time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities blocked the intersection of Hunsaker and Alondra near the 
Dominguez campus, but the students were not cooperative when police attempted 
to disperse them, Easter said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said most of the demonstrators were from Paramount High School, but that 
some Dominguez students were involved. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstrators began with about 50 students, Spear said, but by 3:45 p.m. 
their march had picked up another 400 students and adults. 
</P>
<P>
 In Costa Mesa, Estancia High School junior Carlos Hernandez said, "I think 
(Proposition 187) is just an excuse to get us (Latinos) out of here." 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Alvarado, a drug counselor at the school who tried unsuccessfully to 
persuade students not to leave, said he nevertheless supported their protest. 
If Proposition 187 passes, he said, "It's just going to explode. . . . You're 
targeting the kids as a vehicle to get to a bigger problem, and that's not 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 Demonstrating students in Oxnard hoisted a Mexican flag and chanted "No on 
187!" 
</P>
<P>
 The students marched a block from Oxnard High before they were stopped by 
police. They then retreated to Plaza Park in downtown Oxnard, where police put 
them on school buses that took them home. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Union High School District officials, worried that students at Oxnard 
High would join the march, asked police to detain the protesters before they 
reached school grounds.  
</P>
<P>
 The march was generally peaceful, police said, although a few students threw 
rocks at passing cars, and many ripped election signs from the streets as they 
walked by, converting them into anti-Proposition 187 posters.  
</P>
<P>
 Too young to vote, the students said they were expressing their opinion on the 
controversial ballot measure the only way they could. Most of the protesters 
were Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our friends and family are undocumented people," said 15-year-old 
Rosie Collazo, as she marched down Central Avenue. "Maybe we're a bunch of high 
school students, but we know what we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Both high schools are part of the Oxnard Union High School District, which is 
55% Latino.

PASADENA TURNS TO SELF-EXAMINATION; POLITICS: FEUDS, STAFF RESIGNATIONS AND 
MANAGEMENT ERRORS CONCERN OFFICIALS AND HAVE PUT CITY MANAGER ON THE DEFENSIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HOLGUIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pasadena has often worn its political controversies on its sleeve. But the 
most recent accusations and sometimes painful admissions of mismanagement are 
forcing the city's leadership into a new era of self-examination. 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney recently resigned under fire for allegedly discriminating 
against female staffers. And officials are now investigating whether black 
employees were denied promotions and subjected to racial slurs. 
</P>
<P>
 A string of respected department heads have left the city to take jobs 
elsewhere, and the city manager is under attack. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, the city still feels the sting of the dismal failure of 
its summer soccer festival, as well as the embarrassment of being cited by the 
state for not properly equipping firefighters to battle last year's Altadena 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Two council members recently suggested that the city look at a new form of 
government, perhaps going to a full-time mayor and changed roles for the 
council and city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some leadership problems that we're having to deal with," said 
Councilman Chris Holden, who, along with Councilman Rick Cole, would like to 
reshape Pasadena government. 
</P>
<P>
 Complaints range from financial failures to allegations of institutional 
racism. For instance: 
</P>
<P>
 * Small business owners were incensed last summer when the city's poorly 
planned soccer festival, Soccer Carnaval, flopped and vendors lost thousands of 
dollars. One reason for the failure was that World Cup officials exercised 
their contractual right to keep the festival from opening on game days. The 
city, which had assured the business owners that they would be able to open and 
sell to throngs of game-day fans, has paid settlements totaling $58,000 to 10 
merchants to defray their losses. Eleven claims are pending. 
</P>
<P>
 * In response to complaints from Pasadena firefighters, the state Division of 
Occupational Safety and Health cited the Fire Department in July for using torn 
protective clothing and for failing to supply protective shields during last 
year's firestorm in Altadena. The Fire Department is taking corrective action 
to satisfy Cal/OSHA. 
</P>
<P>
 * City Atty. Victor Kaleta resigned in August under fire from the National 
Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People and women's groups. A consultant 
hired by the city to probe complaints against him found that Kaleta 
discriminated against female lawyers, including one African American, by 
failing to include them in a round of promotions in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The resignation prompted its own storm of criticism, largely against Mayor 
Kathryn Nack for changing her mind and providing the fourth vote needed to 
force Kaleta out. 
</P>
<P>
 * City Manager Philip Hawkey admitted that the city should have been doing 
more to promote African American employees after the Pasadena Black Municipal 
Employees Assn. appeared before the council twice in the past two months 
complaining that too few blacks hold administrative positions. The group also 
said black employees have been subjected to racial slurs and more stringent 
discipline than have other employees. Hawkey is investigating the complaints; 
his report is to be completed by Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 * A number of department heads have left the city recently, including Library 
Director Edward M. Szynaka, who oversaw last year's campaign for a library tax, 
which voters approved. Ramon Curiel resigned as the city's affirmative action 
director last month, and Health Officer Dr. Jacqueline Stiff has resigned.  
</P>
<P>
 * The City Council's infighting and critical nature have chipped away at 
employee morale, contributing to the departure of Szynaka and others. 
Councilman Isaac Richard often sparks council infighting by railing against 
what he sees as injustices against blacks at City Hall and in Pasadena. Cole is 
Richard's favorite target, but the councilman at times has taken on Nack and 
others. Richard also has gone into tirades against city employees, including 
City Clerk Maria Stewart, an incident that drew a censure from the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's factions agree that these developments are troubling, but there is 
little agreement on what should be done to prevent such problems in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard is the only prominent city leader to publicly call for Hawkey's 
ouster. But council members and community leaders have made it clear that they 
fret about Hawkey's ability to run the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all started on April 24, 1990, the day that 800 to 1,000 black people 
showed up in City Hall and protested the hiring of one Philip Hawkey," said 
Richard, an African American, referring to the day that Hawkey beat out two 
black candidates for the post. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Holden and Bill Crowfoot said they have questions about whether 
Hawkey is the right man for the job, although they say they wouldn't vote to 
fire him on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Their primary complaint is that Hawkey and his staff don't always keep them 
well-informed about key city issues and projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowfoot said he was caught unprepared when Soccer Carnaval vendors appeared 
before the council demanding reparations. The councilman said he voted to 
approve the festival with the understanding that a private firm hired to stage 
the event would be liable for any losses. City lawyers belatedly pointed out a 
contractual clause that made it clear that the city was obliged to offer cash 
settlements, the councilman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council "is sitting completely unprepared to deal with the issues coming 
before us," Crowfoot said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holden said he didn't know about the promotion problems in the city attorney's 
office until they hit the public arena with full fury. 
</P>
<P>
 "If these type of things don't come to the surface, and come to the surface in 
a dramatic way, we don't know about them," Holden said. "We're on a dinghy 
without a compass in the fog." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkey met with the council members in a closed session Monday to talk about 
their concerns. The council, which can fire Hawkey at any time, reassured him 
that his position is safe for a year. The council also voted 6-0, with Richard 
abstaining, to extend Hawkey's potential severance pay from two months to the 
industry standard of about six months to a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nack read the following statement after the session: "The council repudiates 
the confrontational attacks upon the character of the city manager and pledges 
to maintain an environment of fairness and respect within which the city 
manager's performance can be measured." 
</P>
<P>
 The city manager acknowledges that there have been some blunders, including 
Soccer Carnaval and the Cal/OSHA violations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hawkey said he has presided over successes as well, including the rebirth 
of Old Pasadena as the area's hot nightspot and the overall staging of the 
World Cup, which produced $2 million in revenue for the city and millions more 
for the local economy. (Richard has disputed the figures, which are scheduled 
for review by a council committee.) 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkey acknowledged that he doesn't pass every detail of city business along 
to the council. In some cases, the bickering of council members would put an 
unnecessary damper on staff initiative, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time we bring (an item) to the City Council, it's the target of 
criticism," Hawkey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Black community leaders also are critical of Hawkey -- primarily because they 
believe that he has not moved quickly enough to promote African Americans into 
management positions. They are waiting to see how he resolves the complaints of 
inequities from black employees. 
</P>
<P>
 A primary complaint is that too few African Americans have moved into top 
spots in city government. Blacks account for 16% of Pasadena's officials and 
administrators, while filling 52% of the city's lower-paid service and 
maintenance positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a large number of people who don't believe that a large number of 
changes have occurred since he's been here," said Joe Hopkins, an activist 
lawyer who represents the Black Municipal Employees Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkey agrees that there should be more minorities in influential positions at 
City Hall, but he also said he already had made some improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Minorities now account for 56% of the municipal work force, compared with 50% 
in 1989, before Hawkey was hired. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the issue was highlighted by the black employees group, the city manager 
moved quickly to address its concerns. Hawkey formed a committee, which 
includes black and other minority employees, to investigate the allegations for 
the report due Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, one white supervisor who allegedly made racist remarks has been 
reassigned so he won't be in contact with rank-and-file employees, Hawkey said. 
A review indicated that the supervisor did not make racial slurs, but he is 
gruff and pushed his employees to perform, Hawkey said. Although the 
allegations were untrue, Hawkey said, he decided it was better for the 
department to transfer the supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Hawkey recently appointed African Americans to the positions of 
planning director, acting director of affirmative action and special assistant 
to the city manager, a rotating position that is seen as a steppingstone to top 
administrative assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't call Hawkey a racist, but I will say he's the top manager of an 
institution that really subordinates people of color," said Prentice Deadrick, 
Hawkey's new special assistant, a member and former president of the Black 
Municipal Employees Assn. "That's a classic definition of institutional 
racism." 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, Hawkey seemed destined for the proverbial frying pan, and race 
has always been an issue providing much of the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 The council hired him on a 4-3 vote after thinking long and hard about 
allegations that he was unfair in dealing with black employees in Toledo, Ohio, 
where he was previously city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkey, like Richard, also has the date that he was hired etched in his mind. 
It was the day that Richard, a community activist who would soon win a council 
seat, vowed to make the new city manager's life miserable. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard has done just that. At times, the councilman walks over to Hawkey 
during a meeting to pledge he will "get" the city manager. Richard has attacked 
Hawkey and other city employees as incompetent or racist. 
</P>
<P>
 The attacks on Hawkey have prompted a multiracial group of prominent residents 
to come forward in his defense. They said they fear that the allegations of 
discrimination will lead to the ouster of the city manager -- a replay of 
Kaleta's forced resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 With all its quarreling and contentiousness, the City Council has deprived 
Hawkey of the support he needs to do the job, said the group's spokesman, Bob 
Monk, a longtime community leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Monk blames Richard, saying he poisons the atmosphere at City Hall by sparking 
council infighting and overly criticizing some city employees. But he also 
blames the rest of the council, including Cole, for trading barbs with Richard 
and adding to the acrimony. Nack draws fire from Monk for failing to throw 
Richard out of the council chambers when he begins a tirade. 
</P>
<P>
 "No city manager is going to be able to function in that atmosphere of chaos 
down there," Monk said. "How do you expect to have a tranquil city government 
when the elected leaders of this town are in chaos?" 
</P>
<P>
 The conflicts have contributed to the departure of some key city 
administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Szynaka, the library director who resigned last summer, said he grew weary of 
a meddling council that wanted to micro-manage and was prone to flip-flop on 
issues, frustrating city administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 But Szynaka, now director of the Indianapolis/Marion County Library system, 
also faulted Hawkey for failing to stand up to the council for the good of the 
city.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PALMDALE MAN WILL FACE TRIAL IN HIS WIFE'S 
SLAYING; COURTS: JEFFREY PEITZ HAD BLAMED THE KILLING ON AN INTRUDER, A MAN 
WHOM AUTHORITIES HAVE RULED OUT AS A SUSPECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Palmdale man who told sheriff's deputies a home intruder killed his wife 
because of her crime-fighting Neighborhood Watch work was ordered Friday to 
stand trial himself for the woman's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 After an unusually long, four-day preliminary hearing that focused on Jeffrey 
Dale Peitz's affection for firearms and an affair he allegedly had with a 
co-worker, Antelope Municipal Court Judge Ian R. Grant ruled there was 
sufficient cause to bind him over for trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant ordered Peitz to appear at a Lancaster Superior Court arraignment on 
Nov. 3, which would have been the 38th birthday of his wife, Teri. The judge 
also ordered that Peitz, 39, remain in jail without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Teri Peitz, who ran a child-care business and organized one of the largest 
Neighborhood Watch groups in Palmdale, died Aug. 12 after being shot twice in 
the head while watching her favorite television show, "Cops," authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Peitz, a postal worker, told sheriff's investigators that he was 
upstairs folding laundry when he heard popping sounds. He said that when he 
went downstairs, he saw a gunman walking out the front door. 
</P>
<P>
 Peitz told police the intruder appeared to be a man with whom the Peitzes had 
quarreled in their Neighborhood Watch work. 
</P>
<P>
 But investigators determined that the suspect named by Peitz had been in 
Michigan at the time of the shooting. Eight days after the slaying, they 
arrested Peitz. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of this week's court hearing, defense attorney Richard S. Plotin 
urged the judge to dismiss the charges, saying they were based on speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that none of Peitz's numerous handguns was proven to be the murder 
weapon and that the shell casings found beside his wife did not match the brand 
of ammunition Peitz stocked at the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Although deputies seized a homemade silencer -- a slit tennis ball that fits 
over a rifle barrel -- from Peitz's garage, they could not prove it was used at 
the time Teri Peitz was killed, Plotin said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, gunshot residue test on Peitz's hands after the slaying produced 
a negative result. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have absolutely no physical evidence in this case to connect my client to 
the crime," Plotin argued. "It just doesn't cut it, your honor." 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Dist. Atty. John A. Portillo said the case against Peitz was solid. 
"We have ample evidence of opportunity, motive and means," the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Peitz told deputies the shooting occurred no later than 9:15 p.m., but 
Peitz did not call 911 until 9:34 p.m. Portillo said this "19-minute gap" gave 
Peitz plenty of time to dispose of the murder weapon and a pair of gloves, or 
merely wash his hands to remove the gunshot residue. 
</P>
<P>
 Portillo also pointed to a letter in which the defendant's 17-year-old 
daughter complained about her parents' constant arguing. The daughter testified 
that her parents attended marriage counseling two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 And a co-worker testified that she and Peitz had been involved in an 
extramarital affair that ended in July after they were interrupted at a 
Victorville hotel by a call from Teri Peitz. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said another motive may have been Teri Peitz's life insurance 
policies, valued at more than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Although investigators did not find the murder weapon, a neighbor testified 
that Peitz once demonstrated a .22-caliber rifle -- now missing -- that could 
have been used in the shooting, Portillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor also referred to numerous "oddities" that contributed to 
investigators' suspicions about Peitz. 
</P>
<P>
 His daughter and his neighbors testified that Peitz, who has a keen interest 
in law enforcement, usually wore a handgun around the house and had 
motion-sensor security lights outside the house. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the night his wife was killed, the security light was unplugged and 
Peitz was not carrying a handgun. He told deputies he had turned off the light 
because of a neighbor's complaint and did not wear a gun that night because he 
had taken medicine for a back ailment. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators testified they became suspicious when Peitz found part of a 
bullet they had missed on the floor, along with a tiny cut in the screen door. 
Peitz suggested that the intruder made the cut to reach the locking mechanism.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; STADIUM TO REOPEN BY MONTH'S END; EARTHQUAKE: 
CRACKED STAIRWELL IS THE ONLY DAMAGE LEFT TO BE REPAIRED AT THE COLLEGE OF THE 
CANYONS FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 College of the Canyons authorities are hoping their earthquake-damaged stadium 
will be repaired by the end of the month, just days before a tri-state high 
school band competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Cougar Stadium sustained more than $600,000 damage, said college President 
Dianne Van Hook. Repairs have taken longer than expected, she said, because of 
soil settling under the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The stadium is normally used by local high school football teams and for 
special events such as the band competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The delays have frayed tempers among high school officials, whom Van Hook 
tried to calm at a meeting Thursday morning. She said the college has 
experienced the same problems getting emergency funding and approval for other 
projects throughout the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know many of you, especially the football coaches, are disappointed the 
stadium was not fixed sooner," she said. "But we have done everything possible 
to get the repairs done." 
</P>
<P>
 College officials previously predicted that the 7,500-seat stadium would be 
open by mid-October, in time for football games that usually draw high 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 The band competition, called Rampage, is set for Nov. 5 and will involve 
schools from California, Nevada and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Endress, representing the William S. Hart High School band for the event, 
said the 2,500 participants and any spectators would have to squeeze into the 
3,320-seat stadium at Canyon High School in Canyon Country if the college 
stadium is unavailable. But the biggest problem with the high school stadium, 
he said, is that the parking lot at Canyon High is not big enough for all the 
student buses. 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing the students in by shuttle buses would be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "They use the buses as dressing rooms, so it has to be right there," Endress 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything has been repaired except a cracked stairwell leading to the home 
side of the bleachers, and that should be done by the end of the month unless 
aftershocks or bad weather interfere, Van Hook said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some alternative plans, such as using a temporary entrance or using only the 
visitor's bleachers, were proposed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking to do anything to get the facility ready," said Andy Iacenda, 
whose son plays tailback for Hart High School. 
</P>
<P>
 But a temporary entrance would not meet Fire Department regulations requiring 
the crowd to be able to exit quickly during an emergency, said Jorge Perez, 
director of facilities, planning and services for the college. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Hook said the college may consider allowing the 1,482 seats on the 
visitor's side of the stadium to be used. Endress said the bands in his event 
rotate through the stadium during the day, so seating would not be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 But college officials noted that the press box, where the judges normally sit, 
and the restrooms are on the home side of the bleachers.

FARR IS OUT TO PROVE SCOUTS WERE WRONG; PRO FOOTBALL: RAM ROOKIE DEFENSIVE 
TACKLE, WHO WAS OVERLOOKED ON DRAFT DAY, IS SHOWING PEOPLE HE CAN DO THE JOB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Deacon Jones watched D'Marco Farr's debut as a Ram defensive tackle last 
August and wondered how so many NFL teams could have screwed up and overlooked 
him on draft day. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, it had happened before . . . to Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones fooled a lot of scouts after he was taken in the 14th round of the 1961 
draft by the Rams. A member of the Fearsome Foursome, he went on to play in 
seven Pro Bowls and earned induction into the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a commentator on Ram radio broadcasts, Jones watched Farr play in an 
exhibition game at Green Bay, turned to colleague Jack Snow and said: "I really 
like this kid. Why wasn't he drafted?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It reminded me a lot of when I came into the league," Jones said. "I might 
have gone in a lower round if the Rams hadn't heard some rumblings that 
somebody else might take me." 
</P>
<P>
 While sculptors won't be carving a D'Marco Farr bust for the Hall of Fame, 
Farr has helped the Rams out of a serious jam this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The only rookie free agent to make the team's active roster, Farr will start 
for the second consecutive week in place of injured Pro Bowl tackle Sean 
Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still have to look in my locker every day to make sure my stuff is still 
there," said Farr, the Pac-10 defensive lineman of the year as a senior at 
Washington. "I'm still a rookie, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 In the new age of the NFL, Farr didn't even have a 14th round to slip to last 
spring, as Jones did more than three decades ago. The draft ended after seven, 
and the scouts' message was perfectly clear: 
</P>
<P>
 You're too small. 
</P>
<P>
 Big mistake, Farr told them. 
</P>
<P>
 There just isn't supposed to be a a market for 6-foot-1, 270-pound defensive 
tackles at this level, which is why Farr is one of the biggest surprises at 
Rams Park this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, in this day, a lot of guys are playing only for the money," Jones 
said. "But with D'Marco it's different, it's personal. He took it personally 
when he wasn't drafted, and he's showing the whole league they made a mistake 
on draft day." 
</P>
<P>
 Farr's size was an issue all the way back to his childhood, when his older 
brothers, Andre, who played football at UCLA, and Mario, picked on him. 
</P>
<P>
 Hooked on pro wrestling shows as a kid, Farr and his brothers often imitated 
what they watched on Saturday mornings. Andre "The Hulk" and Mario "The Basher" 
would gang up on D'Marco "The Dummy" and the brawl was on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Andre wouldn't get into it until we provoked him," Farr said. "Then he turned 
into the Hulk. Mario and I were always throwing each other around, and once in 
a while we would do the old sneak attack on Andre." 
</P>
<P>
 Those maneuvers usually backfired on D'Marco. Nothing worse than a double-team 
from your older brothers, right? 
</P>
<P>
 "I was running for my life," Farr said. 
</P>
<P>
 And when they caught him, he received the torture those poor slobs on the WWF 
get. 
</P>
<P>
 The most devastating hold Farr has survived? Perhaps the DDT made famous by 
Jake (The Snake) Roberts? How about Fritz Von Erich's "Claw hold" or Hulk 
Hogan's leg drop? 
</P>
<P>
 Nope, it was the dreaded figure-four leg lock. 
</P>
<P>
 "One night we were watching a movie and my brother had me in the figure-four," 
Farr said. "He had me locked in for the whole two hours, the whole show. Every 
time I said a word, he put more pressure on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Farr also made a fine pint-sized tackling dummy when Andre and Mario prepared 
for Pop Warner games on Sunday mornings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would go in the garage, suit up and start smacking each other around in 
the garage while Mom was still asleep," Farr said. "We'd break up all kinds of 
stuff. You had to learn to really be tough down there." 
</P>
<P>
 Painful lessons too. Andre and Mario lined up D'Marco at one end of the garage 
and challenged him to make it to the other end. It was two-on-one, and it could 
get pretty ugly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got to play the lonely running back and they got to play the big 
linebackers who come up to smack the little guy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 10 years later, Farr is still lining up against bigger guys. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, he went against New York Giants' guard William Roberts (6-5, 292 
pounds) and finished with three tackles and a deflected pass. On Sunday, Farr 
goes against Saints' guard Jim Dombrowski (6-5, 300). 
</P>
<P>
 "The size of these guys is unbelievable," Farr said. "I don't know where they 
get them. They're monsters." 
</P>
<P>
 Farr thinks his size and quickness help him against bigger, slower linemen. 
Because he's so low to the ground, guards who try to cut-block him often hit 
him in the waist instead of the knee, and he's able to keep his balance and 
finish a play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even with his height," Jones said, "I think the kid could play linebacker 
with his quickness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at the Falcons, they have a couple small tackles, guys around 260. Guys 
like that are usually very, very tough and they pursue like hell. That's one of 
D'Marco's strongest assets." 
</P>
<P>
 Near the end of training camp, Farr changed his jersey number from 94 to 75, 
his college number and the one worn by Jones in his Ram days. 
</P>
<P>
 The match was purely coincidental, but fitting nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was watching one of those ESPN highlight films and there's one segment with 
Deacon in it," Farr said. "They show him making some plays, and he says, 'If 
you don't serve justice, you're going to get kicked around the league.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It just always stuck out the way he said that, because if you don't defend 
yourself, guys are going to push you around and keep running right at you." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones laughed when told of Farr's film studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of these days," he said. "I'll show D'Marco some real pass-rushing film."

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; LOS AMIGOS WILL SETTLE FOR VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nobody on the Los Amigos team or coaching staff seemed to be rejoicing after 
Friday's 28-7 victory over Garden Grove, but the 10th-ranked Lobos were feeling 
a lot better than they were last Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to go through a lot of emotions after that game last week," Los Amigos 
quarterback Ape Tuato said, referring to last week's 28-9 loss to Rancho 
Alamitos. "We played good (Friday night), but not as good as the coaching staff 
would have wanted. But we got a win, and we feel good about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Amigos' victory was more of a workmanlike effort than anything. No big 
plays, no thrills, not a lot of emotion. But the Lobos (6-1, 3-1) executed well 
enough on offense and eventually wore down a smaller Garden Grove team. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was tied, 7-7, after one quarter, and the first half ended at 14-7, 
after Los Amigos kicker Warren Roberge had a 27-yard field goal blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were breaking down a lot offensively," Los Amigos Coach Roger Takahashi 
said. "We weren't fluid at all." 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Amigos controlled the ball most of the second half behind Greg 
Fausto's running and Tuato's passing. Fausto finished with a hard-earned 106 
yards in 25 carries and scored three touchdowns on runs of one, five and three 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuato completed 12 of 20 passes for 185 yards, including seven of nine in the 
second half for 112 yards. He also ran for the Lobos' first touchdown on a 
nine-yard quarterback draw. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove (4-3, 3-1) can still win the league title, but it must upset 
Rancho Alamitos next week to have a chance at that. 
</P>
<P>
 The Argonauts scored on their second possession as they drove 51 yards in five 
plays, but they only reached Los Amigos territory once more the entire game. 
They finished with only 98 total yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Troy Haller was five of 12 for 62 yards and was sacked four times. 
Tailback Ruben Reyna managed only 14 yards in 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were prepared for this game," Stevens said. "But they were a lot bigger 
than us up front and our defense was on the field almost the whole second half. 
They eventually just wore us down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping for them to beat Rancho Alamitos last week, but I think that 
loss woke them up. That's the worst thing that could have happened to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Takahashi was simply happy his team survived the week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Monday was a tough day for us, but time helps to heal things," Takahashi 
said.

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; FOOTHILL'S KEEP-AWAY GAME HUMBLES CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's tough to win when you don't have the ball, Canyon found out Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon couldn't pry the ball away from Foothill in the second half and lost, 
28-10, in a Century League game at Tustin High. Foothill had two monster 
scoring drives in the second half, turning a close game into an easy victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill won its second consecutive game, improved to 3-4, 2-0 in league play, 
and perhaps found a way to subdue future opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights went into the game determined to run a lot of counter plays and 
mix in a few well-timed passes from sophomore quarterback Tyler Lang. 
</P>
<P>
 That didn't work so hot, so Coach Tom Meiss chucked that game plan at halftime 
and went to a power running game. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon (5-2, 1-1) couldn't handle the Knights' offensive line or running backs 
Tramel Robinson, Jason DeAngelo and Nick Sveslosky. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahead, 14-10, to start the third quarter, Foothill held the ball 7 minutes 41 
seconds with Robinson capping the 12-play drive with a 10-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
 After a Canyon drive stalled at the Foothill 45-yard line, the Knights held 
the ball for the next 8:12. Lang completed the 14-play drive with a 19-yard 
touchdown pass to DeAngelo. 
</P>
<P>
 Ball game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hadn't planned a power offense," Meiss said. "We never thought we'd be 
able to do it at the beginning of the year. But it's been there when we needed 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "A one-touchdown or three-point lead is insignificant. One big play and you 
can get your butt kicked." 
</P>
<P>
 Better to keep running, shredding the opposition's defense and keeping its 
high-powered offense off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon had the ball for only 16 plays, punts included, in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Adam Hoover misfired on his only three passes of the second half 
and couldn't improve on the 63 yards he had at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Jacobs, his top receiver, finished with two receptions for 36 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so proud of our defense," Meiss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Tuioti and Rubin Vaughn were particularly troublesome for Hoover, who 
constantly tried to avoid heavy pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Foothill coaching staff might also want to consider honorary defensive 
status to the Knight backfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Lang ran the offense with polish, completing 7 of 10 passes for 139 yards. 
Robinson gained 57 yards in 12 carries, DeAngelo had 11 yards in 52 carries and 
Sveslosky added 46 yards in 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson also caught six passes for 120 yards, including a 67-yard catch and 
run for touchdown late in the first quarter. Lang looked and looked but 
couldn't find an open receiver. Suddenly, Robinson popped free. The ball was on 
target and Robinson weaved his way through Canyon defenders to score.

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; IRVINE TAKES ADVANTAGE OF WOODBRIDGE 
MISTAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A thorough inspection of the culprit revealed no discernible differences in 
color, size, shape or texture. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the football used in the game between Irvine and Woodbridge on Friday 
night appeared to resemble the official product. Yet the ball might as well 
have been from outer space, because Woodbridge played as if it was some 
unidentifiable object in Irvine's 26-0 Sea View League victory in front of 
approximately 3,700 at Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge (5-2, 0-2 in league play) fumbled five times and Irvine recovered 
four of them. The Warriors fumbled in their first four possessions, leading to 
13 points for the Vaqueros (3-4, 1-1). 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't happen very often," Irvine Coach Terry Henigan said, "but we'll 
sure take it." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior kicker Jamie Bertolli was the Vaqueros' top weapon, converting four of 
four field-goal attempts and two points-after. His second field goal, which 
covered 26 yards, came three plays after the Warriors' third fumble and gave 
Irvine a 13-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping we would score touchdowns (after the turnovers)," Bertolli said. 
"But I was ready to kick if it came down to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bertolli also kicked two second-half field goals to put the game out of reach. 
His 32-yard kick with 9 minutes 39 seconds remaining in the game gave Irvine a 
19-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good junior kicker," Henigan said. "He really came through for us 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, solid performances abounded for the Vaqueros. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior quarterback Scott Larsen completed nine of 16 passes for 244 yards and 
one touchdown. He combined with receiver Danny Noisy in the first quarter for a 
53-yard touchdown. Bertolli's kick gave Irvine a 10-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 And Noisy wasn't even the Vaqueros' receiving star of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 That distinction went to senior running back Sean Clark, who caught five 
passes for 117 yards. Three of his receptions covered at least 30 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior linebacker Brian Flynn capped Irvine's rout, intercepting a pass thrown 
by Warrior senior quarterback Casey Harris in the fourth quarter and returning 
it 38 yards for a touchdown. Bertolli's final kick closed the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris' performance typified the Warriors' rough evening. He completed only 
five of 14 passes for 21 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it's not as though he got a lot of support from the running game. In 
addition to the fumbles, Woodbridge struggled when it did hang on to the ball. 
Senior running back Theo Wakefield led Woodbridge in rushing with 54 yards in 
14 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge failed to convert three fourth-down attempts, and the secondary 
blew assignments throughout the game.

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; PERRY PACES MATER DEI'S ROUT OF SAN 
CLEMENTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN ARRITT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was Rod Perry's speed that gave Mater Dei the early boost it needed in the 
Monarchs' 38-7 South Coast League victory over San Clemente Friday night at 
Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry, a sophomore split end, ran down Triton free safety Sean Kolmer after 
Kolmer intercepted a pass from John Flynn at the goal line on the opening drive 
and headed for open territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry finally caught Kolmer at the Monarch 34 and the defense then forced a 
long field-goal attempt that was wide. 
</P>
<P>
 On the ensuing drive, Perry gave second-ranked Mater Dei a 7-0 lead when he 
caught a short pass in the flat, broke two tackles on the sideline and raced 61 
yards for the score. 
</P>
<P>
 From then on, Mater Dei dominated the game on both sides of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Steve Bodnar scored on runs of seven and 15 yards and Pat Shinnefield 
booted a 36-yard field goal giving Mater Dei (7-0, 2-0) a 24-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn, who has thrown only two interceptions this season, recovered from his 
opening miscue and passed for 185 first-half yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensively, the Monarchs held San Clemente to minus-one yard rushing by 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei added to its lead in the second half on Bodnar's third and fourth 
touchdowns of the game. The first was a four-yard burst with 51 seconds left in 
the third quarter and the other covered 37 yards early in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tritons (3-4, 0-2) got their onlyscore on a 18-yard touchdown pass from 
Jeff Carlin to Trevor Insley with 5:57 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Bodnar ran for 73 yards, giving him 143 yards in 17 carries and Flynn 
completed 17 of 28 passes for 249 yards.

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; SCORECARD / COUNTY HIGHLIGHTS FROM WEEK 
7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 HOW LONG IS LONG? 
</P>
<P>
 How long is Ocean View's 36-game losing streak? Long enough that there is no 
heir apparent. Los Angeles Jordan had the second-longest streak in the state 
until last week, dropping 31 in a row before its 9-8 victory over Huntington 
Park last Friday. Who is next on the list? Maricopa? Biggs? California School 
for the Deaf/Riverside? Nobody is quite sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson Tennis of Cal-Hi Sports has traditionally kept a list of the six or 
eight longest winning and losing streaks, which he updates at the end of each 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 However, two factors have kept that list from being useful: Every school 
except Ocean View on the top-six list, the aforementioned teams included, has 
snapped its streak by winning this year. Also, the state library in Sacramento, 
the source of much of Tennis' comprehensive research, has been closed for 
remodeling. CLASH OF THE TITANS 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's game between Mater Dei and San Clemente featured two of the county's 
top linemen in Matt Motherway and Brett Samperi; however, the much-anticipated 
clash between Motherway, who goes both ways for the Monarchs, and Samperi, who 
plays only on offense, never really materialized. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went against each other just one time," Samperi said, "but we ran a 
draw-trap and I didn't get to hit him." ON THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't let Gatorade on the field because of this; it gets your underwear 
sticky." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bill Denny, after getting his first Gatorade-type shower as a head coach -- 
with water -- after Mission Viejo upset Capistrano Valley, 14-13. LOOKING AHEAD 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of long streaks will be on the line next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos, which has not lost in its past 42 games -- although Edison led 
the Griffins, 12-7, with only 38 seconds left to play Thursday night -- puts 
its No. 1 ranking on the line Thursday at Long Beach Veterans Stadium, where it 
plays host to No. 3 Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs, who have two losses this season (to powerhouses Mater Dei and Long 
Beach Poly), are a well-rounded team that should pose a formidable foe. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other end of the spectrum, Ocean View, which has the state's longest 
losing streak (36 games), plays host Friday to Santa Ana at Huntington Beach 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints are winless but have a chance to be a winner when they play host to 
Tustin (0-6) at Santa Ana Stadium at 7 tonight. FLAGS WILL FLY 
</P>
<P>
 It pays to keep your hands to yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 After Mission Viejo's Michael Smith returned a kickoff 34 yards, he was run 
out of bounds on his own sideline, then was hit late by a Capistrano Valley 
tackler. Two of Smith's teammates came to his defense and pushed the offender.

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; MCCLEARY'S SCORES LEAD WHITTIER 
CHRISTIAN, 34-7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Jason McCleary celebrated his first game at running back by scoring three 
touchdowns Friday night in Whittier Christian's 34-7 Olympic League rout of 
Brethren Christian at Artesia High. 
</P>
<P>
 McCleary subbed for starter Steve Machuca, who strained a thigh muscle in the 
first series, and made several big plays for the Heralds (5-2, 1-1).He scored 
twice on the ground and once in the air to finish with 117 yards in 13 carries 
and two catches. 
</P>
<P>
 His biggest play came in the final minute of the first half, with the score 
tied, 7-7. Sophomore quarterback Garrett Estabrook, in his first start, hit 
McCleary with a 46-yard play-action pass down the right sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittier Christian Coach Tom Caffrey got McCleary loose continually with fakes 
to running back Nick Valdez, who rushed for 99 yards in 18 carries. Putting the 
former wide receiver in the backfield caught the Warriors (1-6, 0-2) off guard, 
Caffrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's new to the position, so they had no way of knowing his ability there," 
Caffrey said. "But when Machuca went down, McCleary just took over." 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Ryan Babcock led the Brethren Christian offense, going nine of 21 
for 95 yards. He led the Warriors to their lone score by hitting three straight 
passes in a 70-yard, second-quarter drive. 
</P>
<P>
 His 23-yard pass to John Dingman put Brethren Christian on the one-yard line. 
Running back Dan Muilenburg punched it across from there on the next play.

 Running back Leonard Ibarra scored on a five-yard run with 1 minute 56 seconds 
left to give Westminster a 27-20 victory over Saddleback in a Golden West 
League game Friday at Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning drive was highlighted by a 45-yard completion from Jerry Allison 
to Ibarra that moved the ball to the Saddleback 17-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback (2-5, 1-1 in league) had tied the score two minutes earlier on 
Danny Verino's two-yard touchdown run and two-point conversion run. Westminster 
was offside on Saddleback's first conversion try putting the ball on the 
two-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 The drive began when Hector Hernandez returned a kickoff 66 yards to the 
Westminster 12. The drive took three plays and was aided by a facemask penalty 
that gave Saddleback first and goal at the four. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback had made it 17-12 by driving 55 yards to open the fourth quarter. 
Brian Killingbeck scored on a 15-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster (5-2, 2-0) scored 17 points in the second quarter and led 17-0 at 
the half. Ibarra caught a 36-yard touchdown pass from Allison early in the 
second quarter. Five plays earlier, Ibarra had an apparent 69-yard touchdown 
run called back because of a holding penalty. Allison also connected with Jimmy 
Adkisson on a 28-yarder in the drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Allison ran 56 yards for a touchdown on the first play of the Lions' next 
possession and Westminster led 13-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Allison completed 11 of 20 passes for 209 yards. CATHY LALKO

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; SOUTH COAST LEAGUE; TRABUCO HILLS' 
DEFENSE SHUTS DOWN DANA HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After a tough loss to unbeaten and second-ranked Mater Dei last week, Trabuco 
Hills Coach Jim Barnett was looking for a letdown. 
</P>
<P>
 If this was the Mustangs' down week, Dana Hills should be pretty happy they 
didn't catch Trabuco Hills on a good week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustang defense dominated the game and the rest of the team played well 
enough to spoil Dana Hills' homecoming with a 35-7 victory in a South Coast 
League game at Dana Hills on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "After playing a game against an unbeaten team and then coming in and playing 
against a team that hasn't won a game, you just know there's going to be some 
letdown," Barnett said. "There has to be just a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's about all there was -- a little bit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustang defense limited Dana Hills to 59 yards total offense. Trabuco 
Hills marched 71 yards in eight plays on its first drive and scored on Bobby 
Johnson's one-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs increased their lead when Collins threw 11 yards to Pintsak with 
1:23 left in the first quarter to make it 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
 On the following kickoff, Dana Hills' Brain Harrison let the ball bounce 
before picking it up on the goal line. Bad move. 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills defenders swarmed quickly to produce a safety and a 16-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 After Larry Harper ran four yards to give the Mustangs a 22-0 halftime lead, 
Collins threw eight yards to Jake Anderson to make the score 29-0. Trabuco 
Hills' final points came when Junge ran six yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Hills scored its only touchdown when B.J. Buck caught a six-yard pass 
from Scott Maynard with 2 minutes 15 seconds left in the game. JOE

 Orange Lutheran forced Ontario Christian to fumble at the Lancers' one-yard 
line as time expired, enabling Orange Lutheran to escape with a 21-17 Olympic 
League victory Friday at Brea-Olinda. 
</P>
<P>
 Ontario Christian (6-1, 1-1) took over at their 38 after a Lancer fumble with 
3 minutes 20 seconds remaining in the game.Harlan Miersma, who completed 12 of 
25 passes for 192 yards, then directed the Knights to the Lancers' three-yard 
line with 21 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Vanden Berge, who had runs of 16 and 11 yards on Ontario's final drive, 
appeared to be heading for the game-winning score on third and goal, but was 
hit and fumbled at the one when time expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Lutheran, surviving four turnovers, converted a Knight fumble early in 
the third quarter for a touchdown, giving them a 21-10 lead that proved to be 
just enough when fullback Matt Stratton rumbled in from 25 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights responded shortly thereafter, when Miersma found his favorite 
target, Jared Haringsma, on a 33-yard strike with 2:37 left in the third 
quarter. COREY LYONS

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; SEA VIEW LEAGUE; EL TORO TURNS TURNOVER 
TABLES IN 33-9 ROMP

<P>
 El Toro has been plagued by turnovers for much of the season, but one quarter 
against Santa Margarita Friday night almost evened the breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles turned over the ball three times in their first nine plays of the 
third quarter and El Toro scored 17 points en route to a 33-9 Sea View League 
victory in front of a homecoming crowd of about 1,200 at Trabuco Hills High. 
</P>
<P>
 Tied, 9-9, at halftime, Charger running backs Jamie Hanaway, Murle Sango and 
Joe Ader scored on second-half runs of 54, 65 and 47, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first football game between El Toro (4-3, 1-1) and Santa Margarita 
(3-4, 1-1). 
</P>
<P>
 "Those big plays helped us, but I was really proud of our defense," El Toro 
Coach Mike Milner said. "It's not easy playing against an option offense. I 
thought we did a good job tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro scored on its first two possessions of the opening half, first on a 
25-yard run by Hanaway, then on a 27-yard field goal by Chad Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 But Santa Margarita's defense held the Chargers to two yards in their last two 
possessions of the half. Eagle quarterback Chad Collins connected with Matt 
Nickels for a 25-yard touchdown with 1:01 left. On El Toro's next play, Brian 
Wilson was intercepted by Matt Ahmer at the Charger 49 and Ryan Korinke kicked 
a school-record 47-yard field goal as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
 The second half belonged to El Toro, however. The Eagles never ventured into 
Charger territory. Hanaway scored on the first play and Johnson kicked a 
career-best 45-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanaway finished with 104 yards in 14 carries. Sango had 88 in nine. MICHAEL

<TEXT>
<P>
 Newport Harbor Coach Jeff Brinkley admitted he could live with it, but the 
Sailors' 7-6 victory over Corona del Mar was anything but pretty. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor (7-0, 2-0) lost five fumbles, all in Sea King territory, but 
held on to remain undefeated in front of 5,000 at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very ugly . . . but we'll take it any way we can get it," said Brinkley, 
whose Sailors entered the game as the top-ranked Division V team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't had a turnover in the last three games, then we came out tonight 
and just couldn't hold on to the football." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a fumble that sealed Corona del Mar's fate. A botched snap at the 
Sailor seven-yard line with 20 seconds remaining ended the Corona del Mar drive 
and its hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided that we were going to run a (quarterback) keeper, because it's a 
safe play to set up the field goal," Sea King Coach Mark Schuster said. "I 
guess it's a learning experience." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea Kings (3-4, 1-1) began their final drive on their 25-yard line, but a 
38-yard gain by quarterback Josh Walz, the game's longest offensive play, took 
the Sea Kings to the Sailor 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Four running plays brought the Sea Kings to the seven-yard line, before Jack 
Hogan's fumble recovery sealed the victory for Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar opened the scoring after a three-play, 10-yard drive was capped 
by J.J. DiCesare's four-yard run. The extra point was blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 An interception by Scott Sandstrom gave the Sailors the ball at the Sea King 
eight-yard line. John Giordani found the end zone three plays later on an 
eight-yard quarterback keeper. MATT FARMER

 Esperanza senior tailback Dahrin Footman carried the Aztecs to a 21-7 Sunset 
League victory over Huntington Beach Friday night at Valencia High. 
</P>
<P>
 Footman carried 29 times for 277 yards, scoring all three Aztec touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza remained unbeaten in league play heading into next Thursday's 
showdown with undefeated league-rival Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 Footman scored his first touchdown on a two-yard run 51 seconds into the 
second quarter. On the next series, he leaped over the Oiler defense for a 
one-yard score with 3 minutes 37 seconds remaining in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach senior quarterback Jason Bartusick cut the Aztec lead with 22 
seconds left in the half, as he scrambled through the Esperanza defense for a 
nine-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
 Footman gave the Aztecs insurance midway through the third quarter, when he 
rushed for 52 yards and his third touchdown.  
</P>
<P>
 The Esperanza defense held Huntington Beach to 133 yards total offense, only 
nine yards on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Bartusick was sacked six times, the last a combined effort by Jeremy Viscusi 
and Sean Garney with 2:41 remaining in the game. The Aztecs took over and 
didn't relinquish the ball again. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza totaled 418 yards in offense. Quarterback Chris Stretch completed 
nine of 14 passes for 155 yards. Junior tight end Brian Forth had six catches 
for 141 yards.

42-8 victory over El Modena in a Century League game Friday night. 
</P>
<P>

with 1 minute 5 seconds left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park recovered an El Modena fumble on the ensuing kickoff at the 
Vanguard 18-yard line. After a 17-yard pass from McMahon to Kris Fisher, 
McMahon scored from one yard out for a 14-0 lead.

 Western High's David Bell scored 20 points to pace Western to a 38-20 victory 
over Magnolia in Orange League play Friday night at Glover Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 With Western trailing, 7-0, in the first quarter, Bell returned a kickoff 86 
yards to tie the score.Later in the quarter, he broke through and blocked Tony 
Iliescu's punt and returned it 23 yards for a score to give Western (6-0-1, 
1-0-1) a 21-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell kicked a 32-yard field goal with 10:35 left in the second quarter to give 
Western a 24-7 lead. He added five conversion kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Justin Starkey gave Western its first lead when he caught a 23-yard touchdown 
pass from Dean Chambers with 3:03 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia's Ryan Heiman recovered a fumble by Chambers fumble and seven plays 
later, Robert Nicols passed 11 yards to Carlos Martin for the game's first 
score. 
</P>

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; CHATMAN'S 415 YARDS THREE SHY OF RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Costa Mesa's Charles Chatman rushed for 415 yards Friday night, three shy of 
the Orange County record set by Dana Hills' Jim Gleed in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatman not only was the offensive workhorse -- he carried the ball 43 times 
-- but he also added a defensive spark during Costa Mesa's 28-7 Pacific Coast 
League victory over Aliso Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coach wanted to find out if I was man enough to carry the ball 30 to 40 
times and if I was in shape to play both ways," Chatman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatman responded on both counts, intercepting a pass in the fourth quarter to 
slow an Aliso Niguel drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa's scheme, give the ball to Chatman, was evident from the outset. 
Six consecutive runs by the senior set up the first score, a 19-yard run by 
Joey Archuletta. 
</P>
<P>
 After three plays and a punt, Aliso Niguel was again facing the running 
prowess of Chatman. On second and one on his own 21, Chatman cut outside and 
ran untouched 79 yards for a touchdown and a 13-0 Costa Mesa lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys up front gave me great blocking all night," said Chatman. "I just 
took the holes and ran." 
</P>
<P>
 Aliso Niguel closed to within six (13-7) early in the third quarter when 
defensive back Johnny Nguyen picked up a Chatman fumble and ran 55 yards for 
the score. It was Chatman's third fumble of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unlike Chatman to fumble that much, " said Coach Myron Miller. "A 
slippery ball and a little fatigue may have been the factor." 
</P>
<P>
 Chatman added two more scores in the fourth on runs of 31 and 59 yards before 
time ran out on his run for the record. RICK CHRISTOPHER

 University's offensive line pushed around Laguna Beach's defense Friday night, 
opening holes for the Trojans' squad of running backs and spoiling the Artists' 
homecoming with a 21-14 victory Friday night in Pacific Coast League play. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior running back Tucker Highfield led the ground game for University (4-3, 
2-0), which piled up 340 yards rushing.At 5 feet 10 and 180 pounds, Highfield 
left Artist defenders flat-footed as he carried the ball 16 times for 132 yards 
and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans made it look easy in the first half, scoring on the first 
possession of the game. On a drive that took 52 seconds and two plays, senior 
running back Stuart Meurer ran 19 yards on first down and was followed by Alan 
Price, who ran the option into the end zone from 24-yards and a 7-0 lead with 9 
minutes 49 seconds remaining in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach (1-6, 0-2) came back on its next possession, moving the ball 80 
yards on six plays, capped by a 23-yard touchdown pass from Nate Pivaroff to 
junior Aaron Chesley, tying the game at 7-7 with 7:50 to go in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The remainder of the half was all University, which controlled the ball for 
over 15 of the remaining 20 minutes. The Trojans used a combination of seven 
runners to gain 230 yards in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 On their second possession of the game, the Trojans covered 55 yards on seven 
plays, scoring on Highfield's two-yard run with 3:47 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 On their next possession, the Trojans scored on their final drive of the half, 
taking the ball 78 yards and taking a 21-7 lead on Highfield's one-yard 
touchdown run with 28 seconds left. MELANIE NEFF

 Jose Palacios rushed for 121 yards and scored two touchdowns as Santiago 
spoiled La Quinta's homecoming by winning Friday night's Garden Grove League 
game, 26-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Palacios ran the final 20 yards of the opening drive for the Cavaliers (3-4, 
2-1), and added a one-yard plunge midway through the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cavaliers added two quick touchdowns midway through the third quarter to 
put the game away. Following an Octavio Villa interception, Anthony Callari 
capped a three-play, 32-yard drive with an 18-yard scoring run with 5 minutes 
52 seconds left in the period. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Eckert then recovered a fumble on the Aztec five on the next play from 
scrimmage, and Tom Sokanthong carried it in from there on the following play 
with 4:59 remaining in the period. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs (1-6, 0-4) avoided the shutout on the first play of the fourth 
quarter when Sokanthong dropped back to punt, and chased a wild snap out of the 
end zone for a safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Cavaliers quarterback Christian Cortez completed two of 10 passes for 38 
yards, but rushed for 36 yards had a key interception early in the game. 
Callari finished with 50 yards in six carries. ANDY EISER

 Greg Garand hit Jeff Renaud with a 12-yard touchdown pass with 43 seconds left 
to give Sunny Hills a 13-12 Freeway League victory over Fullerton Friday night 
at Buena Park High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers had driven from their 15-yard line to the Indian five in the final 
two minutes, but Garand was sacked twice for a loss of seven yards.On 
fourth-and-goal from the 12, Garand then found Renaud open in the right side of 
the end zone for the go-ahead score. A two-point conversion attempt failed. 
</P>
<P>
 The game-winner was the second touchdown pass to Renaud from Garand, who 
completed 17 of 34 passes for 219 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton had scored first after a short punt from the end zone by Sunny Hills 
(2-5, 1-1) gave the Indians the ball on the Lancer 27-yard line. Running back 
John Wilkie's one-yard touchdown run gave Fullerton a 6-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers took a 7-6 lead when Renaud caught a 30-yard pass from Garand on 
fourth down with 6 minutes 32 seconds left the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (4-3, 1-1) had three scoring chances in the third quarter. After a 
fumble by Chris Velotta, the Indians' Ryan Gregory missed a 37-yard field-goal 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-yard punt by the Lancers gave Fullerton similar field position, but 
again Gregory missed a field-goal attempt, this time from 35 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton took a 12-7 lead after another Velotta fumble set up a short drive 
that was capped by a one-yard touchdown run by Christopher Young with 3:28 left 
in the third quarter. JASON HILL

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; KENNEDY DEFENSE SHUTS DOWN CYPRESS, 21-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE TERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Normally you don't expect a coach to find fault when his team holds the 
opposition to no touchdowns and 129 yards of offense as Kennedy did in its 21-3 
victory over Cypress Friday at Western High. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the final gun sounded, Kennedy Coach Mitch Olson sounded very 
relieved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were lucky tonight," Olson said, remembering the Irish could only take a 
four-point lead into halftime before putting the game away with two second-half 
touchdowns. "Their defense took away a lot of things we like to do. I was 
feeling scared. When you're only ahead, 7-3, something flukish can happen." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Centurions (2-5, 0-2) could not neutralize Kennedy running back 
Charlie Marino, who rushed 18 times for 101 yards and scored two touchdowns, 
including a 44-yard burst on the Irish's first possession of the fourth 
quarter. Also bedeviling the Centurions was Irish quarterback Jason Myles, who 
had touchdown passes of 22 and 57 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome confirmed John Selbe's way of thinking: There's Kennedy (5-2, 2-0) 
and then there's everybody else in the Empire League. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are a notch above," the Cypress coach said. "They have the best defense 
I've seen in our league. As to whether the Centurions could bring a 
playoff-like intensity to the contest, Selbe sounded if that wasn't the main 
goal. "First we have to be able to compete so we can feel good about the rest 
of the season." 
</P>
<P>
 Expected to improve the Cypress demeanor was the use of Greg Brito at 
quarterback, if his tender ankle would hold up. "He means everything to us," 
Selbe said, although David Wheeler started at quarterback, and Brito at running 
back and receiver. Brito occasionally played quarterback in the second quarter. 
But he completed only two passes for 20 yards, and was held to six yards in 14 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress' best drive in the game was its first. Starting from their 28, the 
Centurions held the ball more than seven minutes and ran off 14 plays before 
bogging down at the Irish 17. Bryan Huskey kicked a 36-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 But the game belonged to Kennedy, especially Marino. In the second quarter, he 
rushed for 40 of his 52 first-half yards, consistently breaking through the 
middle of the Cypress defensive line, and he scored in the half's lone 
touchdown on a 22-yard pass from Myles, who threw the ball while being tackled. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish had one more drive in the half, driving from their 33 to the Cypress 
19 with 14 seconds remaining. But a 35-yard field goal attempt was blocked.

<P>
 Troy took another step toward the defense of its Freeway League title with a 
38-21 victory over La Habra Friday night at Fullerton High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors (6-1, 2-0) followed a strong running game by Larry Montgomery, 
who had 197 yards and three touchdowns, to put away the Highlanders (2-4, 
0-2).Frank Pacheco gained 75 yards and and Ryl Relatores 77. 
</P>
<P>
 Highlanders' quarterback Sonje Berg passed for 248 yards and three touchdowns, 
but also had four interceptions that snuffed potential scoring drives. Twelve 
Highlanders were sidelined because of injuries, but La Habra looked good early. 
</P>
<P>
 It took the opening kickoff and went on an 84-yard drive that included four 
receptions by Will McIntosh for 57 yards, the last being a 10-yard touchdown 
for a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were pretty confused with our coverage in the beginning, but once we got 
that straightened out, I thought our defense played well," Troy Head Coach John 
Turek said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors struck back with 76-yard drive that ended with a five-yard 
touchdown run by Montgomery. The extra point was blocked and La Habra led, 7-6, 
at the end of the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second quarter, the Highlanders got the ball at the 49-yard line after 
a Warrior punt. After an offsides penalty, Berg completed three consecutive 
passes for 54 yards and a touchdown to McIntosh and a 14-6 Highlander lead. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, the Warriors took over. On their next possession, Montgomery went 
right and broke to the sideline for a 45-yard run to the Highlander 34-yard 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 Four plays later, Kevin Gray hit Jim Wise for a 13-yard touchdown and a 
two-point conversion tied the score, 14-14, at the half. TONY APODACA

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; RODRIGUEZ, GONZALEZ TEAM UP TO LEAD 
SONORA PAST BUENA PARK

<P>
 Sonora's passing combination of Kevin Rodriguez to Mark Gonzalez was too much 
for Buena Park's defense Friday night. The duo teamed on three second-quarter 
touchdowns, as Sonora defeated Buena Park, 28-14, at La Habra High. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez connected with Gonzalez for touchdowns of 30, 13 and 55 yards before 
halftime as the Raiders (4-3, 2-0) held on to a share of first place in the 
Freeway League. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6-foot-4, Gonzalez took advantage of a six-inch height advantage over Buena 
Park's defensive back Corey Lyday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gonzalez, who caught five passes for 153 yards, said exploiting that edge 
was never discussed prior to the game. Instead, he credited Rodriguez's 
passing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin (Rodriguez) put the ball in good spots and I just reached up and 
grabbed it," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez completed seven passes in nine attempts for 176 yards and one 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park (1-6, 0-2) got a gutsy performance from quarterback David Barrios, 
who threw two touchdown passes and led the team in rushing with 80 yards in 16 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyday, Buena Park's cornerback, got some revenge at the start of the second 
half. His 50-yard kickoff return set up the Coyotes' first touchdown, a 50-yard 
pass from Barrios to Brett Strike that cut the deficit to 21-7. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sam Escobar's one-yard touchdown run at the end of the third quarter put 
the game out of reach. GEOFF BILAU

GOLDEN WEST TOPS SOUTHWESTERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Golden West discovered a new tailback tandem Friday night as the Rustlers 
hammered Southwestern, 49-10, at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshmen John Sims and Damien Cook combined for 160 rushing yards and five 
touchdowns and the Rustlers improved to 2-1 in the Central Division of the 
Mission Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rustlers started the season with a host of strong tailbacks, but the 
numbers have dwindled. Thomas Green left the team, two others decided to be 
redshirted, and Mark Crowley suffered a season-ending broken leg last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Sims, who had rushed for just 60 yards this season, ran for a career-high 96 
yards in 10 carries and scored on runs of two and six yards to help the 
Rustlers build a 35-3 lead by halftime. Cook contributed 64 yards in 12 carries 
and caught four passes for 114 yards, scoring on receptions of 62 and 31 yards 
and adding an 18-yard scoring run. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing a fumble on its first possession, Golden West scored on its next 
four possessions to lead, 28-0. Freshman quarterback Brian Schneider threw for 
219 yards in the opening half and a career-best 266 yards in the game, 
completing 10 of 13 passes. He connected for three scores, two to Cook in 
addition to a 71-yard touchdown pass to Don Ruberio that opened the scoring 
seven minutes into the game.

HOT RANCHO SANTIAGO TO FACE OCC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week Rancho Santiago Coach Dave Ogas gathered his team together after a 
35-14 victory over Golden West and told the players they were on a roll and 
they deserved it because of their hard work. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, over at Orange Coast, Bill Workman's Pirates are probably working just 
as hard, but the Pirates are moving in the wrong direction. 
</P>
<P>
 While Rancho Santiago has won four in a row and is ranked second in Southern 
California, Orange Coast has lost five in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams meet at 7 tonight in a Mission Conference Central Division game at 
OCC. The Dons (4-1, 2-0 in the division) have outscored opponents, 191-134. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast has been outscored, 143-107, but lost to Pasadena, 27-25, on a 
last-second field goal in the season-opener. The Pirates also lost to Cerritos, 
35-31, to Golden West, 7-6, and to San Diego Mesa, 28-21. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just can't seem to put things together," Workman said.  
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago, the second-ranked team in Southern California, opened with a 
55-28 loss to El Camino but then defeated Palomar, Long Beach, Riverside and 
Golden West. Rancho Santiago has moved from 25th to 18th to 13th in the last 
three J.C. Grid-Wire rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Simon Fuentes, perhaps the biggest surprise of the season, is 
leading the Dons' offense. After graduating from Garden Grove High, he sat out 
a year before being a reserve last season. He is 58 of 86 for 960 yards and 12 
touchdowns with one interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago also has a strong running game (221 yards per game) led by 
Ernie Wilson. Wilson, who missed a game because of a knee injury, has 374 yards 
and four touchdowns. The Dons are averaging 426 yards in total offense per 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast's offense is last in the conference (280 yards per game) but 
running back Jeff Clayton is one of the best in Southern California. He has 
rushed for 541 yards and six touchdowns and is OCC's all-time rushing leader. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Mission Conference 7 p.m. games: 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (2-2-1, 1-0) at Riverside (2-3, 1-1) -- Riverside's running game is 
averaging a conference best 270 yards per game. But the Tigers are last in 
passing at 91 yards per game. Jason Nevadomsky, a sophomore linebacker, leads 
Fullerton with 27 unassisted tackles, six for losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc O'Brien has had a strong season passing but showed he can run as well 
Saturday in Fullerton's 35-19 victory over Saddleback. O'Brien had a 41-yard 
quarterback draw for a touchdown and also scored on a one-yard run around end. 
He caught a pass for six yards as well. O'Brien is 82 of 127 for 1,052 yards 
and five touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback (0-4-1) at El Camino (5-0) -- El Camino is the top team in Southern 
California and third in the J.C. Grid-Wire national rankings. The Warriors are 
averaging 43 points and Saddleback 18. The Gauchos' defense has been solid most 
of the season, giving up a conference-low 15 touchdowns. Pat Wood made his 
first start at quarterback last week for the Gauchos and will start tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback is facing Steve Sarkisian, the conference's top quarterback. 
Sarkisian has thrown for 1,700 yards and 17 touchdowns. But the Gauchos can't 
place too much emphasis on the pass, because El Camino's Robert Jenkins is 
second in the conference in rushing with 608 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Ken Swearingen, in his 19th season at Saddleback, started his career at 
El Camino.

THIRD-STRING QUARTERBACK GALASSO TO START TONIGHT; CHAPMAN: FRESHMAN FROM 
TRABUCO HILLS PLAYED RUNNING BACK EARLY IN THE SEASON AND HAS COMPLETED ONLY 
TWO OF EIGHT PASSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Because his top two quarterbacks are injured, Chapman Coach Ken Visser has 
been forced to call on freshman Jacob Galasso to start tonight's game in Orange 
against Menlo College. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jake wanted to play quarterback when he came here," Visser said. "I don't 
think he anticipated it would happen this fast." 
</P>
<P>
 But Galasso is growing accustomed to quick switches. He began last season as 
one of three quarterbacks at Trabuco Hills High, moved to running back late in 
the season, and helped the Mustangs to the Southern Section Division VIII 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 At Chapman, after finding himself behind Curtis Robinson and Todd Gragnano, 
two talented and experienced quarterbacks, Galasso again moved to running back. 
</P>
<P>
 He got limited playing time in the first two games, but started at tailback in 
the third game against Redlands because Darnell Morgan was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Galasso also got his first taste of playing quarterback in college during that 
game after Robinson and Gragnano were knocked out by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was one of the few games I didn't warm up as a quarterback," Galasso 
said. "Halfway through they said, 'Go warm up your arm,' and I threw about 
three balls and wound up in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't a spectacular debut, but it wasn't a disaster either. Galasso didn't 
complete a pass in three attempts and gained 18 yards in six carries. In three 
series under Galasso, the Panthers only got one first down -- on a Redlands' 
offside penalty -- but the Panthers didn't turn the ball over and that helped 
set the stage for Gragnano's return. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final two minutes, Gragnano led a 62-yard touchdown drive, completed by 
a seven-yard touchdown pass to Dave Poltl, and the Panthers trailed, 14-12. 
</P>
<P>
 On the two-point conversion, Gragnano pitched to Galasso, who passed to Oscar 
Ford to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
 The next week, Galasso completed two of four passes for 49 yards and rushed 
for a touchdown, in mop-up work during a 59-18 victory over Azusa Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Galasso, who has completed only two of eight passes this season, will 
be calling the signals when it counts for the 3-1-1 Panthers. Robinson, resting 
his separated shoulder, didn't practice this week and Gragnano, still bothered 
by an injured finger, practiced sparingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Visser, frustrated with the quarterback situation, decided he needed to settle 
on a healthy one. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a different game plan, not every week, but everyday," Visser 
said. "We're just going to have to let Jacob step in there and build a game 
plan around him." 
</P>
<P>
 Visser said he is confident Galasso can do the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can run the option well and he's got a strong, inexperienced arm," Visser 
said. "He hasn't done a lot of throwing, but the arm strength is there." 
</P>
<P>
 Galasso probably won't be asked to do much passing, but says he will be ready 
if necessary. "I'm twice as good a passer as I was last year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson and Gragnano have accounted for 965 yards, nearly half of Chapman's 
1,942 yards of total offense this season. But Galasso doubts there will be much 
drop-off against Menlo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to be a lot of the same thing," Galasso said. "I think 
we're just going to basically go out and play Chapman ball, make no 
adjustments, just take it to them in every way." Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The 7 p.m. game, Chapman's second home game of the season, is a sellout. . . . 
Quarterback Jacob Galasso says one of the reasons he decided to come to Chapman 
is that it was one of the few schools recruiting him and his older brother, 
reserve defensive lineman Joe Galasso, who played at Orange Coast. "They're 
telling him he will play a lot more this week," Jacob Galasso said. "This will 
be a good game for our family to go to." . . . Menlo (1-5) ended an 18-game 
winless streak by beating Redlands, 22-21, two weeks ago. The Oaks will be 
shorthanded because of disciplinary action after a brawl in their 34-21 loss to 
Claremont-Mudd last week. With 19 seconds left, linebacker Kekoa Mau jumped 
offside, knocking down a Claremont player and triggering the fight. Two 
starters, safety Tim Tulloch and defensive lineman Dave Asiasi, were kicked off 
the team because of the incident and previous offenses. Another starter, 
linebacker Landon Kalua, and two reserves, wide receiver Ramon Fulcher and 
quarterback Pat Canonigo, were suspended for this game and Mau must sit out the 
first half because he was ejected from the Claremont game. . . . Menlo Coach 
Ray Solari, in his 23rd and final year with the Oaks, coached Chapman Athletic 
Director Dave Currey in high school. With Currey at halfback, South Pasadena 
won the 1959 Southern Section Division 2-A title, beating Mater Dei, featuring 
future Heisman Trophy winner John Huarte.

HE HELPED BLAZE FREE AGENTS' TRAIL; BASEBALL: GARDELLA CHALLENGED THE MAJOR 
LEAGUES' ANTITRUST EXEMPTION IN 1947 -- AND STILL HAS SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT THE 
RESULT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't any inflated sense of his worth as a ballplayer that made Danny 
Gardella want to sue the national pastime. 
</P>
<P>
 As an erratic, 5-foot-7 outfielder who batted .272 for the New York Giants in 
1945 against war-thinned competition, he knew his limitations. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor was the Bronx-born Gardella a closet Stalinist bent on torpedoing American 
institutions, although no less a baseball god than Branch Rickey would publicly 
accuse him of "leaning to Communism." 
</P>
<P>
 No, what really drove Gardella into court was the infuriating idea that the 
"big-headed guys" who ran baseball would think nothing of drumming him out of 
their game and then humiliating him in front of a hometown crowd in a 
meaningless exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardella's 1947 lawsuit was the first significant challenge to baseball's 
exemption from federal antitrust law, a challenge that badly rattled the club 
owners and foreshadowed the historic but unsuccessful suit by Cardinal 
outfielder Curt Flood that reached the Supreme Court 25 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I let the whole world know that the reserve clause was unfair," 
Gardella, now 74, said in a recent interview. The reserve clause, then a part 
of the standard major league contract, bound a player to his club for his 
career -- or until his owner decided to trade or fire him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had the odor of peonage, even slavery," Gardella said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardella's lawsuit helped pave the way for free agency, which has sparked 
bidding wars for stars and journeymen alike, driving big league salaries to 
today's stratospheric levels. It also created some of the conditions that led 
to the current, season-killing strike. 
</P>
<P>
 When Gardella reported for spring training with the Giants in 1946, he hoped 
to leverage his power-hitting credentials -- 18 home runs and 71 runs batted 
during the 1945 season -- into a tryout at first base, where his fear of fly 
balls would be a lesser liability. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Gardella, the front-runner was slugger Johnny (the Big Cat) 
Mize, back from the war and ready to reclaim his old position. 
</P>
<P>
 Mize was headed for Cooperstown, Gardella for Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican League baseball was a sizable cut below the U.S. big leagues in terms 
of crowd size, talent and playing conditions. But for at least a few seasons 
after World War II, the pay looked terrific. 
</P>
<P>
 League President Jorge Pasquel, a businessman who owned the Vera Cruz team, 
had opened his wallet to lure major leaguers across the border. Offering double 
and triple the salaries paid by tight-fisted U.S. owners, Pasquel landed such 
stars as Giant pitcher Sal (the Barber) Maglie, Dodger catcher Mickey Owen and 
Cardinal pitcher Max Lanier. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardella got twice his $5,000 salary with the Giants to jump to the Mexican 
League. He recalls sharing a cigar in the outfield one day with Babe Ruth, who, 
though 10 years retired and sick with the throat cancer that would soon kill 
him, had made a lucrative detour from a Mexican fishing trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got $10,000 just to hit a few balls," Gardella said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Gardella figures it, the cash Pasquel was throwing around was not 
investment capital aimed at fattening gate receipts and owner profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasquel was an ally of Interior Minister Miguel Aleman Valdes, who in January 
of 1946 was designated as the presidential candidate of the ruling 
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which -- then as now -- was as good as 
being elected. Aleman went on to become one of Mexico's most influential 
presidents, sometimes called the architect of modern Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardella, who knew enough Italian to quickly pick up Spanish, thinks the 
imported baseball stars were simply meant to boost Aleman's popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, the tactic didn't go over well with Pasquel's fellow owners or 
with the poorly paid Mexican ballplayers, who resented the sums being lavished 
on interlopers from El Norte . 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of how serious a threat Mexican ball might have posed to the big 
leagues, the owners' concern level rose quickly. True competition from Mexico 
might force player salaries higher and cut into profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball Commissioner Albert B. (Happy) Chandler acted in June of 1946, 
announcing that U.S. players who had jumped to Mexico would be banned from the 
big leagues for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Stevens, a former St. Louis Brown who now runs a benefit group for 
retired ballplayers, remembers sitting at a railroad siding in San Antonio in 
1946 and watching teammate Vern Stephens sprint to catch the train after a club 
official -- alerted to the impending ban -- had rushed to ransom the 
power-hitting shortstop back from Mexico. Stephens had bolted so abruptly that 
he left all his clothes in Mexico, Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Gardella, at least at first, the blacklist was a non-event. Mexico meant 
money, baseball and exotic trips, all of which beat riding a bench behind 
Johnny Mize. After a season in Mexico, Gardella became the home run king of the 
Cuban League. When he was back in the States, he could always find a game on 
the semipro circuit. Life was a Havana cigar. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweetness faded one day in 1947 during an exhibition on Staten Island 
between Gardella's semipro Gulf Oilers and the Cleveland Buckeyes, a 
barnstorming squad of Negro National League stars that included future Hall of 
Famer Satchel Paige. 
</P>
<P>
 During the game, a telegram arrived at the park from the baseball 
commissioner's office and was read over the loudspeaker: Anybody caught on the 
same diamond with Gardella or any other Mexican League outcasts could forget 
about ever playing in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 For the black players, it was a horrifying threat. Things had only just 
started thawing for them that season, when Jackie Robinson joined the Dodgers. 
Equal opportunity was a distant star. Tom Yawkey's Boston Red Sox would dither 
for another 12 years before finally putting their first black player, the 
modestly talented Pumpsie Green, on the field at Fenway Park. Now here was the 
chance of a lifetime jeopardized by a penny-ante ballgame on Staten Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardella saw the fix he had put the other players in, so he withdrew from the 
game. But he was still fuming a few days later when his dentist referred him to 
one of his other clients, a lawyer named Frederic A. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson turned out to be a bulldog. He and Gardella filed a $300,000 federal 
lawsuit charging Chandler, the Giants and the American and National leagues 
with engaging in a conspiracy in restraint of trade that deprived Gardella of 
the right to make a living. 
</P>
<P>
 A district court rejected the suit, citing Chief Justice Oliver Wendell 
Holmes' 1922 Supreme Court ruling that baseball was a purely regional 
enterprise and thus not subject to federal antitrust laws governing interstate 
commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardella and Johnson pushed ahead, however, and won a huge victory in federal 
appeals court in February of 1949, when renowned Judge Learned Hand ruled that 
baseball had changed since Holmes' day and that the introduction of national 
radio and TV broadcasts might indeed involve the game in interstate commerce. 
He ordered a jury trial. 
</P>
<P>
 That was enough for the owners. They stepped up the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, Dodger boss Branch Rickey told a congressional committee that 
Gardella and other opponents of a bill to grant baseball an outright antitrust 
exemption "lean to Communism." 
</P>
<P>
 Gardella, for his part, remembers Rickey not as the pioneer who helped Jackie 
Robinson break the color barrier but as "a Bible-quoting cheapskate." 
</P>
<P>
 That same spring, the major league clubs announced a poll showing that most 
players supported the reserve clause. Owen was sent to Gardella's house to talk 
him into dropping his lawsuit, Gardella said. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, baseball granted a general amnesty to the Mexican League defectors. 
Owen, Maglie, Lanier and others quickly returned, but Gardella held out. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in October of 1949, as the Yankees -- as usual -- were crushing the 
Dodgers in the World Series, Gardella caved in. 
</P>
<P>
 He dropped his suit in return for the owners' promise that he could play for 
the Cardinals the next spring, plus a cash settlement of $60,000, half of which 
he gave his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardella joined the Cardinals that spring and came to bat exactly one more 
time in a major league uniform. He flied out. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardella, the father of nine and grandfather of 16, is living with his wife in 
the New York suburb of Yonkers, retired from a long career as a construction 
laborer. He says he is at peace with his life, but something rankles him. He 
still wonders whether he should have settled that case. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardella knows he had good reasons: Johnson told him the owners could have 
delayed the trial for years; the settlement offer was a dozen times what he had 
ever made on a ballfield; he was sick of baseball anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Johnson was wise enough to realize that if we didn't settle, baseball 
would have been considered such a darling that we never could have won," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Rickey's condemnation, Gardella said: "I was no Communist for exercising my 
American rights."

BATTLE OF BACKUPS AS USC PLAYS CAL; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: TROJAN RESERVE OTTON, 
BEAR SUB MCGONIGAL WILL LEAD THEIR OFFENSES IN THE COLISEUM TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Starting the second half of its season with a two-game winning streak, USC's 
confident football team looks for a victory over California today in the 
Coliseum, then a Pacific 10 Conference season-closing sweep of Washington 
State, Arizona and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the goal, a Rose Bowl finish, after consecutive road victories over 
Oregon State and Stanford.  
</P>
<P>
 USC, 3-1 in the Pac-10 and 4-2 overall, will be without injured starting 
quarterback Rob Johnson, but the offense has responded efficiently to sophomore 
backup Brad Otton.  
</P>
<P>
 Cal (2-1, 3-3) seeks revenge for a humiliating loss to USC at Berkeley a year 
ago. The Golden Bears caught Johnson on perhaps his greatest day, when he 
completed 32 of 39 passes for 369 yards and two touchdowns, resulting in a 
42-14 USC blowout. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, throwing to 11 receivers that day, converted 16 of 20 third downs. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal was 2-0 in the Pac-10 until it lost to Oregon last Saturday at Eugene, 
23-7. Coach Keith Gilbertson's team had previously beaten UCLA and Arizona 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cal, too, is down to its backup quarterback.  
</P>
<P>
 Junior Kerry McGonigal has taken over for Dave Barr, sidelined because of a 
broken collarbone. McGonigal didn't respond well last week, completing only 11 
of 32 passes and throwing two interceptions against Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 "He threw the ball well early, but the longer it went, the farther off target 
he got," Gilbertson said. "The pressure was picked up and they took our offense 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbertson said the wave of injuries to front-line players in the Pac-10 this 
season might foreshadow an unhappy future.  
</P>
<P>
 "If we continue to recruit quicker, bigger and stronger players, then we're 
going to have five guys out all the time," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're starting to see in Division I what we see in the NFL -- the big hits on 
the quarterbacks. It's gotten to where if you don't have at least two capable 
quarterbacks, you've got a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilberston was asked about USC tailback Shawn Walters, who had a 234-yard day 
at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oregon ran on us whenever they wanted," he said. "If we aren't improved by 
Saturday, Shawn Walters will need oxygen by the end of the first half." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbertson was unhappy with his offense even before Barr was injured. Cal 
averaged more than 30 points and more than 400 yards in offense in the early 
1990s, but the 1994 numbers are 23.3 points and 355 yards, including a 
55-point, 523-yard game against San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
 USC Coach John Robinson, meanwhile, seems happy with his team, which hasn't 
committed a turnover in its last 11 quarters and is beginning to make big 
defensive plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Employing a bend-but-don't-break deep pass defense against Stanford's Steve 
Stenstrom last week, USC got exceptional games from outside linebacker Erroll 
Small and sophomore safety Sammy Knight.  
</P>
<P>
 "That was the best game Sammy's played since he's been here," said Keith 
Burns, who coaches the Trojan safeties, adding that Knight had his speed and 
aggressiveness under control for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson and defensive coordinator Don Lindsey are also happy with the play of 
their linebackers, the heart of USC's defense.  
</P>
<P>
 Seniors Jeff Kopp and Brian Williams are having their best years, with a 
combined 102 tackles. And junior Errick Herrin has come on with a rush in the 
last three games.  
</P>
<P>
 Kopp is the leading tackler with 60 and has two interceptions. Small is the 
sack leader with three. USC Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Erroll Small, a linebacker who had an interception, two deflections and two 
sacks among his four tackles last week, says the Trojans are "playing with new 
life, with a sense of urgency. Losing to Oregon meant we can't lose any more 
games if we want to go to the Rose Bowl. I'm a senior and I've never tasted the 
Rose Bowl experience." . . . USC cornerback Quincy Harrison will sit out 
today's game because of a hamstring pull. USC TROJANS

STOKES EXPECTED TO PLAY TODAY; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: BRUINS' DONAHUE SAYS WIDE 
RECEIVER PROBABLY WILL GET LIMITED ACTION AGAINST ARIZONA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A year ago, Arizona said, it "held" J.J. Stokes to six catches for 91 yards 
and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the kind of holding UCLA can use today. 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes, whose season has been a nonseason because of a bruise on his left 
thigh suffered in the Bruins' opener against Tennessee, is being called 
probable for today's game against the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
 The final determination will be made during pregame warm-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 His participation will be limited, probably to 20-25 plays, but UCLA will take 
whatever it can get. A victory, for instance. The Bruins (2-5, 0-4 in the 
Pacific 10) haven't had one since Sept. 10, five games ago. 
</P>
<P>
 This week has been one long Stokes watch. UCLA Coach Terry Donahue has been 
doing much of the watching, maintaining daily that he did not expect Stokes to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to try was made Friday after a walk-through on campus and before 
the plane trip to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "He worked on Tuesday, then worked harder on Wednesday," Donahue said. "He 
didn't have any bad effects from it. There has been no swelling." 
</P>
<P>
 There also is little stamina. Hence, the 20-25 play limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Wildcat Coach Dick Tomey hasn't worried about it. He has said all week that he 
expected Stokes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes tried to play four weeks ago, against Washington State, but was able to 
line up for only 23 plays. One of those was a 13-yard pass reception. He 
stiffened at halftime and has been sidelined since. 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue and Stokes had said he would not play again until he is 100% 
recovered, fearing reinjury, as happened in the Washington State game. 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes' return is one more piece back in the puzzle that is UCLA's season. The 
Bruins also will have right guard Matt Soenksen, their strongest lineman, who 
has been sidelined three weeks because of an arch injury. 
</P>
<P>
 That brings the team back to four-fifths strength in the offensive line -- 
only right tackle Paul Kennedy is missing from the unit that started the first 
two games of the season -- with all of the receivers and all of the backs, 
except for reserve fullback Greg Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a cast that might make it easier for quarterback Wayne Cook to deal with 
his own problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes' presence could help most of all. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a team that threw 21 touchdown passes last year, and the guy who 
caught 17 of them has been missing," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook threw 18 of the touchdowns, 15 of them to Stokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook will start today, for the eighth week in a row, but he will be on a short 
leash and Donahue said he will not hesitate to pull it. Cook passed for 270 
yards and a touchdown last week and ranks second in the Pac-10 in passing 
yardage with 1,362. But the offense has become mistake-prone and has shown a 
tendency to break down near the opponent's goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 If the breakdowns recur, or if Cook is struggling, Ryan Fien will get the 
call. He has passed for 176 yards but has a tendency to throw interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook is playing largely because he engineered a 37-17 victory last season, 
throwing two touchdown passes -- the other was to Kevin Jordan, who has caught 
four of Cook's five touchdown throws this season -- and because Arizona's 
defense is considered too tough to give Fien his first start in two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The offensive breakdowns have revealed another problem, field-goal kicking, 
and Bjorn Merten, an All-American last season as a freshman, is facing the 
possible loss of his job, perhaps as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
 He has made only four of his last 11 attempts and missed from 32 yards last 
week. Whether he or walk-on kicker Greg Andrasick, who has never played in a 
college game, will play today will be determined in warm-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 It's that kind of season for UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue gets empathy from Tomey, one of his best friends and the defensive 
coordinator of Donahue's first team as head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been through that here, and I think we all have empathy for each other 
when we go through those kinds of times because they happen to everybody," said 
Tomey, who had a 4-7 record in 1991. "Terry will have his team back playing 
well again soon, and I wouldn't be surprised if it was this week." 
</P>
<P>
 Tomey's best defensive player, end Tedy Bruschi, is not as sympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember last year," he said. "I remember being 7-0 and then losing to UCLA 
and then everything fell apart. I will not forget that this Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a different UCLA team, but Arizona (5-1, 3-0) is about the same one that 
went 10-2, including a Fiesta Bowl shutout of Miami. The 14th-ranked Wildcats 
are in control of the Rose Bowl race and are facing a team that would appear to 
be a bump in the road to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 You could cast the Bruins in the role of spoilers, but it's difficult to cast 
them in any role except that of a team trying to avoid its first six-game 
losing streak since 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our problem right now is that we need to worry about ourselves," Donahue 
said. "We need to worry about how we're functioning, how we're executing, what 
we're doing, as much as what the other team is doing. . . . What we're doing as 
coaches is analyzing how to keep our players from making so many mistakes. Are 
things too complicated? Are the kids not concentrating? Are there too many 
young guys? Why can't we execute? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's more of a concern than, say, Arizona or anybody else we're playing 
right now." UCLA BRUINS

FEATURE ATTRACTION; HOLLYWOOD PRODUCER JEFFREY LURIE IS CENTER OF ATTENTION IN 
PHILADELPHIA AS OWNER OF EAGLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Who is that man in the luxury box next door? And why is he screaming, leaping 
and high-fiving? 
</P>
<P>
 Irritated Candlestick Park patrons wondered. Then they acted, setting down 
their finger sandwiches and papering the side window of their box with giveaway 
posters so they wouldn't have to see him. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Lurie, Hollywood producer and new owner of the Philadelphia Eagles, 
just smiled. And pulled his baseball cap lower over his forehead. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who is that man on the field? Doesn't he know that nobody wearing a suit walks 
around the edges of the stands at Veterans Stadium before a football game? 
</P>
<P>
 What part of the term beer shower doesn't he understand? 
</P>
<P>
 Curious Philadelphia Eagle fans wondered. Then they acted, crowding the 
railings to get a glimpse of . . . well, what do you know? 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Lurie spent the next 30 minutes on the toes of his wingtips, 
stretching halfway into the seats while calloused hands stretched halfway back. 
He basked in the fans' warmth, listened to their dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know," whispered close friend Jack Rapke of Creative Artists Agency, 
"this has to be better than 1,000 movie premieres." 
</P>
<P>
 Lurie just smiled. All his life, he had known. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's too late. Officials can complain that his behavior is in violation of the 
same NFL rules that prohibit touchdown celebrations or droopy socks, but it 
doesn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
 It's too late. Jeffrey Lurie is in. 
</P>
<P>
 He holds the deed to a real, live professional football team. Those guys with 
their big cigars stinking up the league's back rooms are reeling from the fresh 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know something?" Lurie recently told friend Jim Jacobs. "I look at the 
team on the field, and I still can't believe I own it." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither can those who thought the invasion of lawyers and corporations upon 
the professional sports world was complete. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bottom-line guys missed a neighborhood. Lurie, 43, frustrated with 
making sweet movies nobody watched, moved in. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles cost him $185 million last May in a surprise deal for a team that 
few knew was for sale. The price was the most ever paid for a professional 
sports franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he has behaved less like a businessman than an NFL junkie who, after 
watching games every Sunday for years, was magically given the power to step 
inside his TV screen and join the fun. 
</P>
<P>
 This was a guy who has had season tickets somewhere since birth. A guy who 
annually locked himself above his Beverly Hills garage to watch ESPN for the 
entire NFL draft. A guy unashamed to play video football, or admit it. 
</P>
<P>
 This was a guy who once drove to Santa Barbara nearly every Sunday to a cheap 
roadside hotel. He would check into a room and spend the next three hours 
sitting on the edge of a bed watching his hometown New England Patriots, whose 
games were rarely shown in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel manager felt so sorry for Lurie, he charged him only $20 for the 
room as long as he didn't mess it up. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the days Lurie wore a huge button with the Patriots' team picture 
on it. A button with blinking lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, he oversees a team that has won four of its first six games and is 
considered a legitimate NFC contender. 
</P>
<P>
 In doing so, he has also served what many feel is a more important role. 
</P>
<P>
 He has assured everyone that a pro franchise can still be owned by Joe Fan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day has been an adventure," Lurie said. THE FIRST DAYS 
</P>
<P>
 At an outdoor reception in his honor in downtown Philadelphia, he impulsively 
pulls out six new NFL footballs and throws them into the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphians, accustomed to the absentee and sometimes-arrogant reign of 
former Eagle owner Norman Braman, cheer wildly. 
</P>
<P>
 They wait for him to ask for the balls back. He does not. THE NEXT DAYS 
</P>
<P>
 At his first appearance at Veterans Stadium, he is cheered louder than any of 
the Phillies. Then he wins a home-run hitting contest without ever hitting a 
home run. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I hit ropes," Lurie said. "And you can win those things with ropes." 
</P>
<P>
 At his first mini-camp, he notices disappointing second-round draft pick Bruce 
Walker wearing Reggie White's No. 92 jersey. He nearly becomes sick, and 
immediately orders that the jersey not be worn until somebody has proved 
himself worthy. 
</P>
<P>
 White is so touched, he phones Lurie the next day to thank him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just saw this guy wearing Reggie's jersey and I said, 'Whoaaaa,' " Lurie 
says, shrugging. 
</P>
<P>
 Took the words right out of about 60,000 fans' mouths. THE MIDSUMMER DAYS 
</P>
<P>
 Lurie finds the money to sign every veteran and rookie before the end of July. 
It is the first time in recent memory that every player shows up for training 
camp on time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you how good that made the team feel, to have no distractions 
from unsigned rookies or holdouts," says center David Alexander. "The advantage 
that gave us was huge." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most owners, Lurie doesn't even have trouble signing his No. 1 draft 
pick, tackle Bernard Williams from Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it is because during negotiations, Lurie sends his lawyers to Memphis, 
Tenn., after Williams has been roughed up by police in a case of mistaken 
identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams signs shortly thereafter, and is now the league's top rookie tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is my philosophy that once you are involved with a player, you do 
everything possible to create the atmosphere that we are all in this together," 
Lurie says. THE LATE SUMMER DAYS 
</P>
<P>
 Lurie shows up at the team's West Chester University training camp with a 
suitcase. He collects the key to one of the dorm rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Much to the amazement of the team, he announces that he is moving in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe he would actually stay in one of those tiny rooms," 
Alexander says. "But it was neat to have him there. In the past during training 
camp, our owner has been in the south of France." 
</P>
<P>
 Lurie never actually sleeps in the dorm, but rests there while working 15-hour 
days. THE EARLY FALL DAYS 
</P>
<P>
 He makes his first mistake. It is the sort of mistake that would be made only 
by a fan. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of cutting good players to have an injury cushion under the 
$34.6-million salary cap, he orders his coaches to decide upon the 53 best 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 Then just days before the start of the season, he asks six of those players to 
take 30% salary cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 He figures as long as the best players are in the locker room, that locker 
room can survive any discontent. He figures wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The six players file a grievance through their union. The only starter of the 
six, tackle Broderick Thompson, says that the cuts were on the team's mind when 
they opened the season against the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you get across the line and you get on the field, you think you're going 
to forget about it," Thompson says. "But it's still in the back of your mind. 
It's still a distraction. Even when I woke up that (Sunday) morning, I was 
thinking about it." 
</P>
<P>
 They fell behind in the first quarter of that game, 14-0, before losing, 
28-23. Since that fateful first period, they have outscored opponents, 140-92. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll admit, I made a mistake in the timing, but I just wanted to make sure we 
started the season with our best players," Lurie says. 'I'm going to make 
mistakes, but I think the people will respect a well-intentioned owner." 
</P>
<P>
 The grievance was recently settled when the players had much of their pay 
reinstated. Judging from the most popular signs at Veterans Stadium these days, 
all has been forgiven: 
</P>
<P>
 Lurie, Lurie Hallelujah!'  
</P>
<P>
 Lurie Be. The Norm Storm Is Over  
</P>
<P>
 "I bought this team only as a guy obsessed with building a Super Bowl 
champion," Lurie says. "I had no idea all these other things came with it. I 
had no idea the impact of a team on a community's spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 He received his first clue during one scary moment last summer while walking a 
downtown Philadelphia street in search of a map. 
</P>
<P>
 A large, smoking bus screeched to a halt in the middle of the street, directly 
in front of Lurie. Out jumped a red-faced driver with an attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is that really Jeffrey Lurie?"' the driver yelled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Uh, yes sir," Lurie replied, startled. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver didn't want to curse him. He wanted to embrace him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to stop the bus when I saw you," the driver told Lurie. "I wanted to 
thank you on behalf of everybody in Philadelphia. You've uplifted our city. You 
seem to know how important the Eagles are to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Lurie eventually purchased the map, but it has not helped. It's difficult to 
follow road signs when you're walking on air. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, Jeffrey Lurie is football's first owner who got so excited 
after a regular-season victory, somebody actually mentioned the numbers 911. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened after the Eagles' stunning 40-8 victory over the San Francisco 
49ers. Lurie was so full of congratulatory words for defensive coordinator Bud 
Carson, he lost his breath during their postgame meeting. Bystanders nervously 
waited for him to hyperventilate. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is off the meter," said Joe Banner, team vice president and longtime 
friend. "As kids, we would stand around acting like general managers, making 
trades, talking about games. All those years, we dreamed about something like 
this. 
</P>
<P>
 "And now, Jeff is living it." 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in suburban Boston as an heir to the General Cinema Corp. fortune 
-- one of the largest movie theater chains in the country at the time -- Lurie 
had season tickets with his family for the Boston Patriots' first season in the 
new American Football League. 
</P>
<P>
 Lurie has since seen the Patriots at the Boston University Field, at Fenway 
Park, at Foxboro . . . and in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 That is where he flew once while making a movie in a rural coastal area of 
Mexico. The Patriots were in a playoff game and, as best he could figure, only 
one hotel in the country was showing it on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 He checked into that hotel, watched the Patriots lose, repeatedly slammed his 
fist on the bed, fell into a depressed sleep, then awoke the next day and 
returned to location. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was crushed," he said. "I practically broke my wrist that day." 
</P>
<P>
 Lurie was born into privilege but grew up not feeling very privileged. When he 
was 9, his father died of a brain hemorrhage. His brother Peter was autistic. 
</P>
<P>
 He later responded by becoming a community activist and watchdog for those 
without influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Before moving west, he founded and taught at an alternative high school for 
needy students in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always been attracted toward those without power," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After moving to Hollywood eight years ago, as the owner of Chestnut Hills 
Productions, he says he tried to make movies that made social and political 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from ticket sales, though, the only statement his three feature films 
made was, "Don't watch me." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sweet Hearts Dance" and "I Love You to Death" were critical successes, but 
nobody was watching. Then he made, "V.I. Warshawski," an ill-conceived female 
detective film that was considered among the worst in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned that in movies, it's more about the deal," Lurie said. "It is so 
difficult to be able to keep the vision intact about what you want the movie to 
be."  
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen months ago, when he saw that the New England Patriots were on the 
market, he knew exactly where to redirect his vision. 
</P>
<P>
 With money from not just General Cinemas, Inc., but the company with which it 
had merged, publishing giant Harcourt General, Inc., Lurie had the cash. And he 
certainly had the interest. 
</P>
<P>
 While bidding for the Patriots, he examined every strip of college tape of top 
prospects Rick Mirer and Drew Bledsoe. 
</P>
<P>
 He was so close to buying the team on draft day of 1993 that the Patriots 
actually phoned him in a room above his Beverly Hills garage where he was 
watching the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Team officials wanted to make certain he could handle a lucrative contract for 
Bledsoe. By then he had already decided he liked Bledsoe over Mirer. He told 
them yes. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Bledsoe was becoming a rookie success with the Patriots, Lurie never 
left the clubhouse. He was ultimately outbid for the team by Robert Kraft, the 
Foxboro Stadium lease holder. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter John Shaw. Yes, the same John Shaw who has been shopping the Rams around 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Lurie was directed to Shaw, the Rams' vice president, by officials in 
Baltimore who were hoping Lurie would buy the Rams and move them east. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said Georgia Frontiere had no interest in selling the entire operation. 
However, Shaw told Lurie, there is this owner named Norman Braman. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the story can be found on the Veterans Stadium field, where the 
Eagles say they have never been more relaxed or confident of their direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good situation now," said cornerback Eric Allen. "We needed somebody 
to come in here and voice their concern about winning, somebody who will work 
right there with you. This guy is like that." 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the story can also be found on Philadelphia's streets, where 
often-ignored segments of fans are receiving Lurie's attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a perspective you wouldn't expect," Banner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lurie has already walked out of an important free-agent news conference to 
quietly attend the playground dedication at a nearby children's welfare home. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the first pro sports person in this town to actually invite me to his 
office," said Donald Smallze, a disabled Vietnam veteran and local charity fund 
raiser who recently posed for pictures with Lurie. "He is the kindest man in 
this business I have ever come across." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for some Eagle employees, though, the rest of the story can also 
be found in the team's front office. 
</P>
<P>
 Expect Lurie to clean house this season if the Eagles don't win a couple of 
playoff games. Coach Rich Kotite will be fired and replaced by somebody with 
more charisma, somebody who can double as a general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Lurie would love to hire Jimmy Johnson, but Johnson has said that Lurie sounds 
an awful lot like a potential Jerry Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 As the honeymoon ends, that will be Lurie's biggest battle, avoiding the 
perception that he is a meddler, a fan who has fooled himself into thinking 
he's a football expert. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will ask questions, I will sit in on meetings, sure," Lurie said. "But I 
will leave the decision-making to the people who know this business best. I 
will let them do their jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Lurie's job, as his discerning public sees it, is to keep on being himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Quite often that is enough, as he learned while signing autographs during 
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman approached and said, "Jeffrey, you have no idea what you've done for 
my family. You saved my marriage." 
</P>
<P>
 Lurie said, "What?" 
</P>
<P>
 The woman said, "After last year, my husband insisted on giving up our season 
tickets. I said no way. This was a nightly battle that was heading us for 
divorce. But as soon as you took over the team and my husband watched your 
initial press conference, he agreed. We kept the tickets. We've been happy ever 
since." 
</P>
<P>
 Lurie tells that story and smiles, implying that this has been the most 
rewarding part of his short tenure as an NFL owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting die-hard, irrational, wonderful football nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 People just like him.

NICHOLS LEADING JACKLIN; SENIOR GOLF: HE SHOOTS A 64 FOR A ONE-STROKE EDGE OVER 
THE FORMER U.S. AND BRITISH OPEN CHAMPION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tony Jacklin, who won the U.S. Open and the British Open while playing golf's 
regular tour, prepared himself for the Senior PGA Tour in a most irregular 
fashion, even by golf standards. 
</P>
<P>
 He took 10 years off, but he didn't play like it Friday in shooting a 
six-under 65 to trail Bobby Nichols by one shot after the first round of the 
Ralphs Senior Classic at Rancho Park. 
</P>
<P>
 It might not be the right approach for everyone. Then again, there are a lot 
of things a golfer can do in an entire decade of not playing in tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Like these: Whittle a golf cart out of a tree trunk; embark on a lecture tour 
('Why Graphite?'); fashion golf balls out of Milk Duds painted white and baked 
in a kiln. 
</P>
<P>
 All Jacklin did was go from 40 to 50. Once he became eligible for the seniors, 
Jacklin grabbed his clubs and started swinging. His fourth time out, he won. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacklin's victory in the First of America Classic at Grand Rapids, which he 
entered with a sponsor's exemption, was his first in a PGA Tour event of any 
kind since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols, who had six birdies in a row from No. 6 to No. 11 on Friday, could go 
no lower than a 64, which he was pretty proud of anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't been a very good year for me, but this sure beats the heck out of 
working," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols said Rancho Park is one of the tour's hardest in pitching the ball on 
the green, but he birdied No. 8 and No. 9, back-to-back par fives, with 
pitching wedges that got the ball to within eight feet and three feet of the 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
 He also pitched to three feet and made par after missing the fairway and the 
green on No. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 If Nichols thought the greenside rough was tough, he wasn't really 
complaining, though, mainly because he has seen it all before. He played the 
1961 L.A. Open at Rancho Park. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of five was at 67, three shots behind Nichols, including 1993 Senior 
PGA champion Tom Wargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen more shot 68, including leading money winner Dave Stockton and last 
week's champion, Bob Murphy. Raymond Floyd shot 69 and is five shots back in a 
group that includes Jim Albus, Miller Barber, Lee Elder and Bob Charles. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacklin proudly pointed to his 65. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my lowest round round of golf in 12 years, in or out of competition," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, he has been out. Jacklin gave up his PGA Tour privileges in 1973 to 
return to England and concentrate on the European Tour. He captained the Ryder 
Cup team in 1983, 1985, 1987 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 In almost no time, he was 50, he felt like playing golf again and was ready 
for the senior tour, moving to a new home in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacklin's rookie senior season has spanned 12 events, three top-10 finishes 
and $187,172 in prize money. After being away for so long, Jacklin knew it 
would be difficult, and it has been. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest is the mental part of it," Jacklin said. "The mental discipline 
of tournament golf. That's what it's all about, really. When you don't play 10 
years or 50, you get out of the habit of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacklin is trying hard to readjust. It promises to be an ongoing effort, but 
that's how golf works, said Jacklin, who finds its quirky nature both appealing 
and frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never really win," he said. "It's a challenge between you and the 
elements to make the best of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the fun of it. That might sound a bit masochistic, but that's what we 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 So that's why. No wonder Jacklin is back at it, playing golf again. He 
couldn't stand thinking of all the pain he was missing.

THE NFL / BILL PLASCHKE; SWITZER KEEPS THE COWBOYS ON WINNING TRACK -- HONEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barry Switzer shuffles toward his desk at the Dallas Cowboys' training 
complex. He grimaces and lowers himself gingerly into his chair. 
</P>
<P>
 The room is filled with a deep sigh, the kind that accompanies the end of a 
tortuous journey. Some days for Switzer, crossing his office is that journey. 
</P>
<P>
 It's his lower back. There is a pain there as big as Texas. A nerve thing. 
Doctors have already cut him once. Standing on artificial turf for four hours 
on a Sunday can be agony. 
</P>
<P>
 How does he handle the pain? 
</P>
<P>
 "Whiskey," Switzer says. "I drink plenty of whiskey." 
</P>
<P>
 In his six months as coach of the Cowboys, Switzer has done this sort of thing 
time and again. 
</P>
<P>
 The leader of the two-time defending NFL champions is approached in search of 
wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
 His inquisitors are knocked backward with honesty. 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer is watching film of last week's 24-13 victory over the Philadelphia 
Eagles. When he gets excited, he stamps his feet and says, "Whoo-eeeh," then 
pushes the rewind button over and over. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he never played or coached in the NFL before, he is asked whether he 
knows what he is watching. 
</P>
<P>
 He answers, as usual, by explaining what he doesn't know. 
</P>
<P>
 "See all those linemen there?" he says, pointing to the green-shirted Eagles. 
"Don't know any of those guys. Hell, no. I know quarterbacks, running backs, 
guys like that. But those linemen. Hell, no." 
</P>
<P>
 He laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I can't even tell you which teams are in what divisions in the 
other conference, that AFC," he says. "Now, I know the names of all the teams 
over there. I think. I just can't tell you where they go." 
</P>
<P>
 Why does he say such things? Why acknowledge ignorance of everything from the 
playing rules to opponents' names? 
</P>
<P>
 Why on earth did he leave the field for several minutes late in a recent game 
against the Washington Redskins, missing several key plays, and then later 
admit he was using the bathroom ? 
</P>
<P>
 No coach in the history of the game has ever acknowledged leaving the field to 
use the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "What did you want me to do, make a mess?" Switzer asks. 
</P>
<P>
 The answers to several such questions finally became clear last weekend, when, 
after one quarter, his team had gained six yards, had no first downs and no 
pass completions, and trailed the Eagles, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys didn't quit. They only played harder until they had shed their 
funk, then manhandled perhaps the second-best team in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys didn't quit because their coach has them believing, as Jimmy 
Johnson once did, that they are incapable of quitting. 
</P>
<P>
 They believe this, because they believe everything else Switzer says. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, what kind of person would lie about not knowing the length of the 
halftime intermission? 
</P>
<P>
 It is this honesty that has convinced most of his players that he is doing a 
good job. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest risk of the 1994 NFL season is working. 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer is doing a good job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barry has done exceptional," said Troy Aikman, another Cowboy who shoots 
straight. "He has been very honest, very up front. The players have responded 
to that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right or wrong, there is nothing artificial about him. And we appreciate 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Told of those comments, Switzer reacted in his typical smooth fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Troy said that? Really?" Switzer said. "What else did he say?" 
</P>
<P>
 He was told that Aikman endorsed Switzer's habit of talking to individual 
players, catching guys in hallways and in front of soda machines and in 
deserted end zones. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas Jimmy Johnson delivered a weekly theme to the entire team every 
Wednesday, Switzer passes it along bit by bit, player by player, one on one. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has struck us as a guy who really wants to get to know his players, what 
makes them tick," Aikman said. "Jimmy sort of kept his distance." 
</P>
<P>
 As coaches go, however, there is no comparison between Switzer and Johnson, 
nor will there ever be. For players of the modern era, Johnson is still the 
best NFL coach breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 And Switzer is still, well, not responsible for the Cowboys' league-leading 
defense. Or their powerful offense. 
</P>
<P>
 He only calls the short-yardage and kicking plays. 
</P>
<P>
 His halftime speech last week consisted of, "OK, boys, let's go out in the 
second half and pour it on." 
</P>
<P>
 And yes, he has left his team four times on Saturday nights to watch his son 
play college football. No coach in recent memory has acknowledged doing that 
once.  
</P>
<P>
 "Barry has no real point of reference right now, and so the things he does 
leave him open for criticism," Aikman said. "But it's refreshing." 
</P>
<P>
 And it's working. His light but apparently sincere touch is keeping the 
Cowboys, with a 5-1 record, on a course for history. 
</P>
<P>
 For Switzer is fulfilling his sole requirement as curator of what is currently 
the NFL's most important treasure. 
</P>
<P>
 He is not messing things up. 
</P>
<P>
 COACH'S CORNER 
</P>
<P>
 It's not quite midseason, but rating the league's coaches is the sort of fun 
that lasts all year. 
</P>
<P>
 The five best: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Bobby Ross, San Diego Chargers -- No team plays harder or makes fewer 
mistakes. He might be the best active coach, period. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Bill Belichick, Cleveland Browns -- There finally seems to be a method to 
his madness. He has built a great defense and is adapting with an injury-ridden 
offense. And enough about Bernie Kosar, OK? Quarterbacks don't win games in 
Belichick's scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Dennis Green, Minnesota Vikings -- Major points for an unchanging style 
while working with an ever-changing roster. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Dave Wannstedt, Chicago Bears -- Nobody gets more out of less. Those who 
say he blew it by signing Erik Kramer have never seen Kramer in January. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Rich Kotite, Philadelphia Eagles -- He is not the total coach-general 
manager-salesman package that owner Jeffrey Lurie wants. All he does is turn 
shredded teams into winners. 
</P>
<P>
 The busts: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Wade Phillips, Denver Broncos -- You know what they say about nice guys. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Dave Shula, Cincinnati Bengals -- Really now. A Bengal general manager who 
is the son of the late Paul Brown should have known better. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Wayne Fontes, Detroit Lions -- Looks great smoking a cigar. Looks bad 
running a team. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Art Shell, Raiders -- We loved it when he shouted down quarterback Jeff 
Hostetler on the sideline. But we hated it that Hostetler refused to apologize. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this a coach who has lost his players? 
</P>
<P>
 5. Sam Wyche, Tampa Bay Buccaneers -- Enough, already. 
</P>
<P>
 THE HIDDEN 
</P>
<P>
 SOUTH-CENTRAL 
</P>
<P>
 A reporter from a Los Angeles newspaper approaches cornerback Mark McMillian 
in a quiet corner of the Philadelphia Eagles' locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles have been playing well, McMillian is a hometown kid, a second- year 
starter in one of the league's best secondaries. He has played well, shut down 
Sterling Sharpe and John Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 A nice note, maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 Then McMillian stares at the reporter in wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know," he says, "you are the first Los Angeles newspaper guy to ever talk 
to me." 
</P>
<P>
 You mean this year, right? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I mean ever," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely he is mistaken. Nobody can play at Kennedy High in Granada Hills, then 
at Glendale College, then at the mighty University of Alabama, then be a 
10th-round draft pick of the Eagles in 1992 and never be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you live in South-Central L.A. where I lived, it can happen," McMillian 
says. "The media there still acts like we don't exist. All kinds of athletes 
come out of there, but people are afraid to go down there and interview them, I 
guess." 
</P>
<P>
 But there are hundreds of Los Angeles athletes in the sports world. Why should 
we make an exception for South-Central kids? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just trying to tell you how important it is that those of us from the 
neighborhood who make something of ourselves are recognized," McMillian says. 
"I really want to be a role model, I really want to go back there in the 
off-season and help others who were in my shoes. But how can I do that if 
nobody knows what I do?" 
</P>
<P>
 McMillian, who has succeeded even though he didn't play until his senior year 
in high school, talks of returning home in the summer and playing basketball 
with old acquaintances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys will say, 'I remember you from somewhere. What do you do?' " McMillian 
relates. "I will say, 'I play ball. For the Philadelphia Eagles.' And they say, 
'No, really? You're kidding me?' " 
</P>
<P>
 McMillian shakes his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Little kids needs to know that there are people like me out here," he says. 
"But it's hard to get across that message." 
</P>
<P>
 He smiles. "OK, so what did you want to know about this team?" 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, that does not seem so important. QUICK HITS 
</P>
<P>
 * NEON PROBLEMS: Although the rest of the league figures Deion Sanders will 
give the staid San Francisco 49ers a much-needed jolt toward the playoffs, 
those inside the locker room aren't on that page. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say that several veteran 49ers, always the classiest team in the 
league, are furious that Sanders injured himself during last week's celebrated 
sideline dance after his 93-yard interception return for a touchdown against 
the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
 They are also furious that he began his postgame news conference in the 
Georgia Dome with the words, "This is my house." 
</P>
<P>
 Couldn't Jerry Rice say the same thing everywhere the 49ers play? 
</P>
<P>
 Couldn't players in the high-powered 49er offense have perfected sideline and 
end zone dances by now? 
</P>
<P>
 Except Rice rarely brags. And his teammates never dance. 
</P>
<P>
 They just win, something that won't be so easy late in the season if Sanders 
continues to stir up the locker room with his shtick. 
</P>
<P>
 * NEON POSTSCRIPT: The probable reason that Sanders and Andre Rison were not 
ejected after their fight Sunday can be found in the identity of the 
officiating crew. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by referee Gordon McCarter, it was the same crew that was heavily 
criticized for calling a taunting penalty on Chris Calloway of the New York 
Giants during their recent failed comeback attempt against the New Orleans 
Saints. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL has shown it is not reluctant to publicly embarrass officials with 
apologetic phone calls to teams. McCarter and his crew probably didn't want the 
hassle. 
</P>
<P>
 * YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T KNOW THAT BEETHOVEN WAS ALSO A PRETTY MEAN PAINTER: 
After the Pittsburgh Steelers' 14-10 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals last 
week, Coach Bill Cowher said, "It wasn't a Mozart." 
</P>
<P>
 * HEAVE SHULER: His five interceptions against the Arizona Cardinals last week 
are not the real reason rookie Heath Shuler of the Washington Redskins has been 
benched. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say Redskin coaches are frustrated by Shuler's inability to figure out 
the new offense and his lack of work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has no idea even what the game plan is," one Redskin said. 
</P>
<P>
 * WE COULD BE WRONG, BUT WE DON'T THINK FUZZY THURSTON AND RAY NITSCHKE EVER 
HAD THIS ARGUMENT: Although it obviously had no impact on their 13-10 overtime 
victory over the Green Bay Packers on Thursday, the Minnesota Vikings were 
divided earlier this week by a typical modern-day fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Adrian Cooper and Henry Thomas brawled over the use of a trainer's table. 
</P>
<P>
 * THEY WERE TURNED TO ORANGE PARMALEE: How well did Bernie Parmalee play in 
the Miami Dolphins' 20-17 victory over the Raiders last Sunday? 
</P>
<P>
 Several times during the team meeting Monday, when Parmalee appeared on the 
game film, Coach Don Shula asked for applause. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the first time that ever happened," Shula said.

 Starting wide receiver Jessie Hester was unable to practice Friday because of 
back spasms, but Coach Chuck Knox said he hopes treatment will allow Hester to 
play Sunday against the Saints. 
</P>
<P>
 If he is unable to play, rookie Isaac Bruce will start, Knox said.

 Knox designated running back David Lang, tackle Jackie Slater, defensive

 The offensive line has taken a physical beating this season, but starting 
guard Leo Goeas has endured to remain in the lineup despite a badly injured 
ankle.

 Goeas was injured against Kansas City and believed he had a broken ankle. He 
was sent for X-rays twice, and after being assured it wasn't broken, he agreed 
to play on.

 The last few weeks he has received pain-killing injections before playing, but 
the medication wears off by the fourth quarter.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; SECONDARY GETS READY FOR AIR ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Defensive backs James Trapp, Dan Land and Donald Frank normally play in only a 
few select passing situations, but that will not be the case Sunday against 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing against the Falcons' run-and-shoot attack, which features four wide 
receivers for nearly every down, the Raiders' secondary will be severely 
tested. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody in the secondary has to be prepared and ready to play," Coach Art 
Shell said. "They have a pretty good group of receivers, but it all comes down 
to the quarterback and (the Falcons' Jeff George) is a good one." 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta has two players on pace to catch 100 passes this season in Terance 
Mathis (51 catches) and Andre Rison (49). With George passing for 1,773 yards 
and 11 touchdowns, the Falcons have the league's fourth-best passing attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Raider linebackers Greg Biekert, Winston Moss, Rob Fredrickson and Mike Jones 
might not play much against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's true, they sure won't get that much work at all," Shell said. "They 
run four (wide receivers) for nearly every down, even goal-line and 
short-yardage situations." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A victory over Atlanta would give Shell 50 victories in his coaching career. 
His record is 49-38. . . . In his 11-year career, Jeff Hostetler has never 
played against Atlanta. . . . Backup quarterback Vince Evans, 39, and Atlanta 
linebacker Clay Matthews, 38, were teammates at USC and are two of the oldest 
active players in the league. LONNIE WHITE

GRGURICH PASSES TEST OF TIME; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: FORMER UNLV ASSISTANT HIRED 
AS COACH DESPITE PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a longtime assistant to Nevada Las Vegas' Jerry Tarkanian, Tim Grgurich was 
no stranger to NCAA investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite being named in a number of alleged infractions, Grgurich knew last 
year he could return to college basketball without facing sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Grgurich, who agreed Friday to a three-year contract worth about $300,000 a 
year to replace Rollie Massimino as UNLV coach, received a letter from the NCAA 
dated March 12, 1993, saying, in essence, he had served his penance. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter, from David Berst, NCAA assistant executive director for 
enforcement, said, in part: " . . . you are not facing any NCAA penalty or 
disciplinary action that would follow you." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the resolution, Grgurich agreed to be cited for two minor 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
 He admitted to once allowing the high school coach of former Rebel Travis Bice 
to buy two first-round NCAA tournament tickets from UNLV's allotment, and to 
helping Rebel players cash their paychecks, then driving them around Las Vegas 
to pay their rent and utility bills from that money. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, Grgurich was named in seven areas of an infractions case in which 
the NCAA charged Las Vegas' basketball program with rules violation in nearly 
40 areas, many stemming from the 1986 recruitment of former New York high 
school star Lloyd Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations linked to Grgurich included holding cash in envelopes for 
players, providing tickets for recruits' high school coaches, making illegal 
visits to recruits' homes and providing living arrangements for a player. 
</P>
<P>
 He has denied any wrongdoing. His attorney, Roy E. Smith of Las Vegas, said 
last year NCAA officials dismissed the serious allegations because of a lack of 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 But the allegations were not processed because Smith and other attorneys 
evoked the Nevada due process statute to stall the NCAA's official inquiry 
against the individuals. After that, the NCAA processed its case only against 
the university while the constitutionality of the due process statute was 
debated in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Berst said this week there was no reason to continue the process on Grgurich 
and some of the others named in the inquiry because so much time has elapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The case has expired now and they haven't been involved in the athletics 
program since then," Berst said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grgurich, who was a Seattle SuperSonic assistant, has been out of college 
basketball for two years, which probably would have been the extent of any 
penalty imposed. 
</P>
<P>
 UNLV interim President Kenny Guinn confirmed late Friday afternoon that an 
"agreement in principle" had been reached and that Grgurich was expected to 
sign the contract by this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "To bring back someone from the past took a lot of courage on his (Guinn's) 
part," Grgurich told the Associated Press. "I'm willing to back him up as much 
as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate matter, Grgurich also was sanctioned for a controversial 
preseason practice in October 1991 that was secretly videotaped by a UNLV 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged practice was held two weeks before the season officially began 
during a conditioning class taught by Grgurich. Thirteen of the 28 students 
were basketball players. 
</P>
<P>
 University officials reported the incident to the NCAA. Grgurich was required 
to attend a training session covering NCAA rules and was banned from teaching 
future conditioning classes, a source familiar with the case said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grgurich sued UNLV over the videotaping incident, and reached a $100,000 
settlement. He left the school in July 1992, when Tarkanian resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Grgurich's hiring came a week after Rollie Massimino agreed to an almost 
$1.9-million buyout, and over the protest of the school's athletic director, 
who said the move to hire Grgurich would give the perception that the Tarkanian 
era was back. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic Director Jim Weaver resigned during the negotiations with Grgurich, 
but will stay on until the end of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaver said he was perceived as a link to past turmoil at UNLV and would step 
aside for the good of the university.

MUIR OVERCOMES EARLY DEFICIT TO DEFEAT ARCADIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MARK STRODER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pasadena Muir High football team always seems to take the road less 
traveled. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs, notorious for doing things in a non-conventional fashion, 
trailed Arcadia, 14-0, less than four into their Pacific League showdown at 
Arcadia on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of throwing in the towel, Muir got motivated, scoring 27 
unanswered points to win, 27-14. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs, ranked 15th by The Times, are 5-2 overall and 2-0 in league 
play. Arcadia, ranked 14th, is 6-1 and 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't get down on ourselves when we trailed early," said Muir Coach Mike 
Harrison, whose team is undefeated in three games since he took over for Jack 
Allen. "We knew we could play with these guys. I told my players not to quit -- 
and they didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 A blocked punt for a touchdown and a 29-yard touchdown pass from quarterback 
Jason Wagner to Nick Rossomanno after a Muir fumble gave Arcadia the early 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Muir answered with a 39-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Jeremy Bonwell to 
Danett Johnson and a one-yard touchdown run by Bonwell to tie the score, 14-14, 
before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs took the lead for good at 21-14 when Bonwell, who completed seven 
of 15 passes for 138 yards and two touchdowns, hooked up with Jonathon Johnson 
on an 18-yard pass play with 11:12 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kept our composure and played as a team," said Bonwell, who scored a 
second touchdown on a one-yard run with 6:45 to play.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The State high school cross-country championships are five weeks away, but the 
top two races of the season -- in terms of quality teams -- are expected to 
take place at today's Mt. San Antonio College Invitational in Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight of the top-10 ranked Division I teams in the state and four of the top 
six Division II squads will compete in the boys' team sweepstakes race. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls' team sweepstakes event will include seven of the top-10 Division I 
teams and seven of the top nine Division II schools.  
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks is favored in both races. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers are the defending State Division I boys' champions and the No. 
5-ranked team in the Harrier magazine's national poll; the girls are ranked 
15th nationally and first in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmichael Jesuit -- the No. 1-ranked Division II team in the state -- Newhall 
Hart, Rolling Hills Estates Peninsula and Camarillo are expected to give 
Thousand Oaks its stiffest competition in the boys' race. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Strahan of Hart, Mike Stember of Jesuit and Antonio Arce of Palmdale 
have established themselves as the three top runners in the state during the 
first half of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls' team sweepstakes will mark the first clash of the season between 
Thousand Oaks and Irvine, the defending State Division I champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks' top six runners finished within 62 seconds of each other in a 
dual meet Tuesday and junior Kim Mortensen should be among the race leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's meet, which will include more than 40 races, starts at 7:30 a.m. JOHN

 Hoch, who held a two-shot lead after 36 holes of the tournament played on 
three courses, could do no better than a third-round 70 at the TPC at Summerlin 
and fell into a three-way tie for the lead at 199, 16 under.

 Reich, who attempted to play a similar role in the baseball strike, said his 
involvement "is to try to contribute ideas and dialogue to encourage the 
process. . . . The only ones who can resolve it are Bob (Goodenow, head of the 
NHLPA), and Gary." He added, "I view this differently from baseball. In 
baseball, they set out to level a successful union. In hockey, there's no 
question (owners) want some things, but I get the feeling hockey owners want to 
play hockey. I hold out much more hope for a negotiated settlement in hockey. 
I'm not optimistic about a negotiated settlement in baseball." Tennis

 The Chicago Cubs and San Diego Padres hired new managers on Friday, and the 
Cincinnati Reds retained Davey Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Riggleman, manager of the Padres the last two-plus seasons, joined the 
Cubs, teaming with old friend Ed Lynch in a new management team aimed at 
reinvigorating the struggling club. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past six weeks, the Cubs have hired a president, general manager and 
field manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Bochy, third base coach of the Padres the last two seasons, was elevated 
to manager to replace Riggleman. 
</P>
<P>
 Bochy, 39, takes over a club that was 47-70 during the strike-shortened 1994 
season, the worst record in major league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who had the Reds in first place when the players' strike stopped the 
season in August, will return as manager in 1995 and then move into the front 
office for 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson signed a two-year contract extension. In 1996, he will be a special 
assistant to General Manager Jim Bowden.

 But lawyer Chuck O'Connor of the owners' Player Relations Committee said the 
players forfeited the right because of lost service time during the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 The players' union insists that the 11 players are being improperly denied 
their 52 days of service time. Even though the players were on strike, union 
officials said, they still were on active major league rosters.

 Frank Nakamura's Ah Sigh returned from a two-month layoff to win the first of 
six trials to the $180,000 Ed Burke Memorial Futurity by two lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 Under John Creager, Ah Sigh paid $3.00 to win. Runninbac returned $4.00 and 
$3.60 and Alibis Assets paid $3.40. 
</P>
<P>
 The extremely fast winning time of 17.57 seconds for the 350 yards guarantees 
the Charlie Bloomquist-trainee a spot in the Nov. 4 final. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, Chenilles Dasher won her trial in 17.73 in the next race on the

OAK TREE AT SANTA ANITA; TURF QUEEN FLAWLESSLY RETIRED

 Flawlessly, the two-time Eclipse Award winner as the nation's top female grass 
performer, has been retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Whittingham, who trained the 6-year-old mare for most of her 28-race 
career, said she will probably leave next week for Ballindaggin Farm in 
Lexington, Ky., where she will serve as a broodmare. 
</P>
<P>
 "There comes a time when it had to happen and we just felt it wasn't worth 
taking a chance of getting her hurt by racing her again," Whittingham said. 
"She's a mare who has never been easy on herself. She tries so hard all the 
time, so she's got some wear and tear. You'd hate to take her out there one day 
and have something happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Second to Hatoof in the Beverly D. at Arlington Park in her last start on Aug. 
27, Flawlessly was being pointed toward a possible fourth consecutive victory 
in the Matriarch on Nov. 27 at Hollywood Park before the decision was made to 
retire her. 
</P>
<P>
 With 18 victories, four seconds and three thirds, Flawlessly ranks eighth on 
the all-time earnings list for female runners. She finished with $2,572,538, 
putting her behind Trinycarol, Triptych, Bayakoa, Paseana, All Along, Lady's 
Secret and Dance Smartly. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Louis and Patrice Wolfson's Harbor View Farm, Flawlessly's only 
victory this year came in the Ramona Handicap at Del Mar, a race she won three 
consecutive years. Besides the Beverly D., she was third in both the Beverly 
Hills and Gamely Handicaps at Hollywood Park. 
</P>

 When it comes to the Breeders' Cup Distaff, Lakeway is the forgotten filly. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the attention recently has focused on Sky Beauty, the Shug 
McGaughey-trained duo of Heavenly Prize and Dispute and defending champion 
Hollywood Wildcat. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months ago, Lakeway was all the rage, and deservedly so. The 3-year-old 
daughter of Seattle Slew won Grade I stakes at Santa Anita, Hollywood Park and 
Belmont Park and would have won another at Churchill Downs (the Kentucky Oaks) 
had not Kent Desormeaux been outridden by Eddie Delahoussaye. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the stumble at Saratoga. Heavily favored against six others in the 
Alabama, Lakeway offered no resistance when challenged by Heavenly Prize and 
finished second, beaten by seven lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 "We shipped in there just before the race and she looked great and acted great 
and everything," trainer Gary Jones said. "But then she ran terrible. We scoped 
her and we found all kinds of pus and mucous in her throat. She's had trouble 
with allergies and they all kicked up on her. Going from Hollywood Park to 
Saratoga, it's a totally different environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hurried to get her back home and she was very sick when she got back. 
Basically, it developed into pneumonia." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jones said Lakeway rebounded from the illness quickly, and Friday morning 
at Hollywood Park she worked seven furlongs in 1:24 2/5 under Desormeaux. Jones 
said she galloped out a mile in 1:37 3/5. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Jones will saddle Inner City, the 2-1 favorite, in today's feature, the 
$75,000 Henry P. Russell Handicap at 1 1/4 miles on the turf. Impressive in his 
American debut when he rallied from last to win by a length on June 29 at 
Hollywood Park, the 5-year-old Bob Back horse was on target for the Eddie Read 
Handicap at Del Mar, then, if all went well, he was going to be supplemented to 
the Arlington Million. A nervous horse, Inner City became very rattled by a 
severe lightning and thunder storm the night before the Eddie Read and had to 
be scratched. Brought back in an allowance race 10 days later, the Irish-bred 
wanted no part of the starting gate. "He went nuts," Jones said. "You could 
hear him screaming in the grandstand. He was fighting and everything. He was 
just nuts." Schooled extensively in the gate, Inner City showed marked 
improvement in his next start, finishing third in the How Now Handicap on Sept. 
2. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading rider Corey Nakatani was sidelined Friday because of what was called a 
mild concussion. Nakatani, who turned 24 Friday, was injured when thrown from 
Nonprodutiveasset after the 4-year-old had worked seven furlongs Friday 
morning. Kent Desormeaux was sidelined for the second consecutive afternoon 
because of illness.

CLIPPERS SIGN NO. 1 PICK MURRAY TO FIVE-YEAR DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 California forward Lamond Murray will replace the player he grew up idolizing, 
All-Star forward Dominique Wilkins, who left the Clippers to sign an 
$11-million, three-year contract with the Boston Celtics last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, the Clippers' top draft pick, signed a $13.5-million, five-year deal 
with the club Thursday. Murray, who won't play in tonight's exhibition game 
against the Sacramento Kings at UC Davis, will join the team for practice 
Sunday night at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Wilkins) was only here a half-season, so I don't think that I would be 
replacing him because he only stayed for a brief period of time," Murray said 
at a news conference Friday at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The seventh player selected in the draft, Murray missed the first two weeks of 
training camp because of contract negotiations. But he doesn't think he'll have 
trouble preparing for the Clippers' season-opener against the Portland Trail 
Blazers in Yokohama, Japan, on Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very stressful not being in camp and not being there the beginning day 
with all your teammates," Murray said. "I have a lot of catching up to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper General Manager Elgin Baylor said Murray has a bright future. "He has 
the ability to be an All-Star," Baylor said. "The guy's a very talented player. 
No one is saying he's going to come in and turn everything around. He's not 
Shaquille O'Neal or Michael Jordan, we all understand that. Players like that 
are capable of making an immediate impact and turning a franchise around. But 
he's going to be a very important part of the success of this franchise." 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, 6 feet 7 and 236 pounds, averaged 24.3 points to lead the Pacific 10 
in scoring last season. He needed only three seasons to surpass Kevin Johnson 
as Cal's leading scorer with 1,688 points.

THE END OF INNOCENCE; WHEN THE FAIRY TALE IS OVER, IT LOOKS LIKE A GRIM FUTURE 
FOR THE NATIONAL PASTIME

 "Grandpa, how come there's pro football and pro basketball but there's no pro 
baseball?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, Petey, fact is, there used to be pro baseball. Major league baseball, 
they called it. And it was big. There were teams in all the major cities -- 
some cities even had two -- and baseball was known as the national pastime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heck, there were pro baseball teams long before there were any pro football 
teams and long before the game of basketball had even been invented. And right 
around this time of year was the best time of all for 
</P>
<P>
 baseball. October was always World Series time." 
</P>
<P>
 "World Series?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Right. There were two leagues, the National and American. The teams in those 
leagues would start their seasons in April and play almost every day or night 
right through the summer until the end of September. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know how in the NFL and the NBA, every team plays every other team? Well, 
it didn't work that way in baseball. Teams stayed in their leagues until the 
very end. That's one of the things that made the World Series so special -- the 
American League champion played the National League champion in a seven-game 
series." 
</P>
<P>
 "Gosh, that sounds exciting, Grandpa. Did people get excited?" 
</P>
<P>
 "They sure did. Do you remember last July, when I took you to the circus? 
Well, the place where they had the circus used to be a baseball stadium. It was 
called Dodger Stadium then because the Los Angeles Dodgers played there. When 
the Dodgers played in the World Series, it was full of people. And millions 
more watched on television or listened on the radio. It was sort of like having 
a week's worth of Super Bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
 "And some of the most exciting baseball seemed to come out of the World 
Series. Babe Ruth pointed to where he was going to hit a home run, then hit one 
there. Don Larsen pitched a perfect game. Willie Mays made an over-the-shoulder 
catch that robbed Vic Wertz of a home run. Reggie Jackson hit three home runs 
in one game. Kirk Gibson was hurt one year and could hardly walk but he made it 
to the plate and hit a home run that just wiped out the Oakland A's and won the 
Series for the Dodgers." 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, there were some awful bonehead plays, too, but that all added to 
the fun." 
</P>
<P>
 "Gee, Grandpa, that sounds so neat. I'd like to see a World Series some time. 
What happened to baseball? How come we only have kids' baseball now?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, that's a long, sad story, Petey. Let's see, you're 8 now? Well, big 
league baseball started to disappear about 10 years before you were born, back 
in 1994, I think it was. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem was, baseball had grown so big but the players and the guys who 
owned the teams couldn't agree how to split up the money. You would have 
thought that grown men and women could have worked out some kind of compromise 
that would have made everybody happy, and rich, but it just didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The owners said they couldn't make any money if they had to pay it all to the 
players, and the players said that without them there couldn't be any baseball 
so they had it coming." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was just being selfish, right, Grandpa?" 
</P>
<P>
 "That's about it, Petey. If I remember this right, the owners wanted to start 
limiting how much the players could make. They called it a salary cap and said 
if the players were going to share in the profits, they could share in the 
business risks, too. Well, the players said they lived in a free-market society 
and could make as much money as the owners would pay them. And always before, 
the owners had paid them whatever they asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "This time, though, the owners wouldn't give in. They said if the players 
wouldn't accept the salary cap, they'd make them accept it and that they had 
the legal right to do it. The players said if that was the case, they just 
wouldn't play anymore, and went on strike." 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened then, Grandpa?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, everybody figured that the owners and players would find a way to 
compromise but they all got stubborn, instead. Even the federal government 
couldn't make them see that they were really hurting themselves, and all the 
people who made a living in baseball, and all the people who liked baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty soon, they were going back and forth in court. The players were suing 
the owners one day, then the next day the owners were suing the players. There 
were lawsuits all over the place. And I remember the first spring training 
after the strike, the owners called up a lot of minor league players and said 
these would be their players that season. But the people had seen that trick 
before, during a football strike, and they knew these weren't major league 
players. So a lot of them quit going to ballgames. 
</P>
<P>
 "What really hurt, though, was that TV pulled its money out and the owners had 
to rely on the live gate. And the players' union kept pressuring the new 'major 
leaguers' to join the old players on strike so the caliber of baseball kept 
getting worse and worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a few years of that kind of stuff, everybody kind of lost interest in 
baseball. The lawsuits ran the owners out of money to operate the clubs and the 
ballplayers had to find other work. 
</P>
<P>
 "And there were other sports for the people to watch, of course. Pro 
basketball added six more weeks to its season and the NFL decided to start six 
weeks earlier, so even if baseball ever does come back, it's going to have a 
hard time finding a niche in the sports market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hockey could have made a great leap forward, too, but the hockey guys were 
having the same argument as the baseball guys and that's why the NHL sort of 
stayed the poor relation in pro sports. Soccer might have become a major game 
here, too, because it got a great reception when the World Cup was played in 
the United States in '94, but the soccer guys couldn't get it together fast 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that's all ancient history, Petey. It's been 18 years since we've had a 
World Series and I don't think we'll ever have another one. Sure would like to 
see one more, though, before I die. Oh, well. What are you up to now, kiddo?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Me and my friends are going out to play baseball, Grandpa. Maybe someday 
we'll have pro baseball again. Maybe we'll even have the World Series again. If 
that happens, I want to be good enough to play in it."

LOS ANGELES TIMES SPECIAL REPORT / BASEBALL; A SERIES GAME USED TO MEAN 
SOMETHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES, Bob Oates is a Times staff writer. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For millions of us, this is a special time. This is World Series time. Show 
time. If the players and owners hadn't killed it with their dispute, another 
show would have opened today, unless it rained, or the earth moved. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been like that for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost every October, from one decade to the next, the World Series has been a 
hit attraction even in America's small towns -- where in the 1920s, far from 
any ballpark, the defining symbol was often a giant World Series scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 The inning scores were about a foot high. 
</P>
<P>
 If you were watching, you saw it in Ken Burns' baseball documentary. As an 
awestruck schoolboy, I saw it in Aberdeen, S.D. 
</P>
<P>
 Our scoreboard stood in front of the granite-faced building at Lincoln and 
Fourth that was home to the Aberdeen Morning American, my future employer. 
</P>
<P>
 That was before television. It was before radio. So, in South Dakota, we kept 
score. 
</P>
<P>
 The sports editor of the American, monitoring the telegraphed play-by-play 
report, worked smoothly with the scoreboard operator. And every half inning, 
there it was -- another zero or maybe a one, a two or a three. 
</P>
<P>
 A man with a megaphone told us about the home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Invariably, the intersection in front of the newspaper office was alive with 
baseball fans -- many of them in from the farm, or off the train from Ipswich 
-- and the roar of the little crowd as the numbers went up was a distant echo 
of the thunder in Yankee Stadium or Sportsman's Park. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1950s, the downtown scoreboards were gone, radio was going, and live 
pictures of the action in Brooklyn or the Bronx were actually coming into my 
new house in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the era of daytime, weekday World Series television. Every day was 
like an NFL Sunday now. And for students, preachers, writers and others with 
their own working hours, it was the best era yet. 
</P>
<P>
 On my street in the Baldwin Hills, after my friends left for work, I 
entertained their wives. And one day in the third inning, Jane Gaynor, a Yankee 
fan from across the street, predicted that her pitcher was on his way to a 
no-hitter. My wife, a Dodger fan, said you can't no-hit a World Series team -- 
especially the Dodgers. But that day, as Gaynor ran screaming out the door, Don 
Larsen did. 
</P>
<P>
 It was three years later that the show came to California for the first time. 
The memory that lingers of that bright, sunny day in 1959 is simply being in a 
World Series dugout in Los Angeles before the game. Later that afternoon I 
talked with a dozen or more of the 93,000 spectators in a dozen sections of the 
Coliseum, which, we all concluded, was the best baseball park ever built. And 
because of its unique features -- among them the fascinating left-field screen 
and so many thousands of unobstructed-view seats -- I still think it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger owner Walter O'Malley, the brightest man I've known in sports, once 
told me that he felt compelled to build a perfect Dodger Stadium to avoid 
comparisons with the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 The light-hitting Dodgers survived an 11-0 blowout by the Chicago White Sox in 
the first game and won the 1959 Series in six games, but O'Malley didn't seem 
to enjoy it much. He didn't respect the opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 He knew the Dodgers had lucked into the championship in a rare down year for 
the New York Yankees, who in that era won 10 pennants in 12 seasons for Manager 
Casey Stengel. 
</P>
<P>
 From the '20s to the '90s, during the World Series of my time: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stengel was the most effective manager. An advocate of platoon baseball, he 
once used a record seven pitchers in one game -- and won that Series, too. 
Turning 70 the year he won his last pennant, Stengel said most people his age 
were dead. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The century's two most overpowering players were Willie Mays and Kirk 
Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
 Mays' over-the-shoulder catch in deep center -- reminding Ram fans of Elroy 
(Crazy Legs) Hirsch's over-the-shoulder Coliseum catches -- won the 1954 World 
Series for the New York Giants in the first game, demoralizing the Cleveland 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson's pinch home run -- in the only at-bat he could make in the 1988 Series 
-- won the championship for the Dodgers in the first game, demoralizing the 
Oakland A's. 
</P>
<P>
 -- My all-time achievement award winner is Reggie Jackson of the Yankees, who 
in 1977 hit four World Series homers on four consecutive swings. After a home 
run in his last at-bat one day, Jackson, in the next game, walked on four 
pitches, then hit three more home runs with his next three swings against three 
Dodger pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 No other hitter, not even Ruth, ever got in a comparable groove. Jackson's 
streak might have been the hottest in sports history. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It was about that time that I first heard the best of the baseball stories, 
the one about the two old pitchers who gravely discussed the future one 
afternoon while seated side by side in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you think they play baseball in heaven?" Lefty asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope so," said Rip, who tragically died later in an automobile accident, 
but got in touch with Lefty again as soon as he could. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, do they play baseball up there?" Lefty demanded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll give you the good news first," Rip said. "Yes, they do play baseball in 
heaven. The bad news is, you're pitching Sunday."

THE END OF INNOCENCE; DESPITE THE STRIKE, A YOUNG FAN REMAINS HUNGRY FOR THE 
GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DAVID SHAW, David Shaw writes about the media for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lucy and I took our son Lucas to his first major league baseball game when he 
was 8 months old. A month later, we took him to his first fancy French 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhat surprisingly, he attacked the smoked salmon, seafood sausage, potato 
risotto and creme brulee at Citrus with the unbridled glee of a Michelin 
inspector gone berserk. Not at all surprisingly, he slept through most of the 
game at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas was 5 last month, and over the past four years, he has had many more 
opportunities to sample my two favorite pastimes. He still loves to eat in nice 
restaurants -- and to do most of the more traditional things that little boys 
like to do -- but until The Strike, baseball (and the Dodgers in particular) 
had become his one true passion. 
</P>
<P>
 He could tell you the name and uniform number of almost every player on the 
Dodger roster, and even though he can't read, he could also recognize their 
names in the sports pages. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final two or three months before the strike, Lucas' first words to his 
mother on waking up every morning were, "Read me the standings." 
</P>
<P>
 He was soon able to recognize the names of most of the teams in both leagues, 
and over breakfast every day, he would "read" aloud, telling us each team's 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Expos are the best team," he said the day before the strike. "I think 
they'll play the Yankees in the World Series." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Lucas told me he missed baseball "really, really badly." Then he 
said, "The strike's probably not going to be over until I'm dead." 
</P>
<P>
 When I assured him that not even the major league club owners could possibly 
be stupid enough to let the strike go on that long, he brightened slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it'll be over when I'm 7," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope so. Given the mercurial nature of most kids' enthusiasm these days, I 
worry that by the time the greedy morons who run baseball finally agree to 
settle, Lucas will have moved on to something else, and the unique joy of 
baseball will forever be lost to him. This is, after all, the era of computers, 
video games, MTV and VCRs. Everything is speeded up, nothing lasts very long, 
and there's no shortage of competition for a young boy's attention -- even if 
his parents are baseball fans. 
</P>
<P>
 I've rooted for the Dodgers since their Brooklyn days, and I've been a 
season-ticket holder for more than a decade -- although I only go to 15 or 20 
games a year. Lucy, a native New Yorker, has been a Met fan since she began 
taking her younger brother to Shea Stadium in the mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 We didn't force baseball on Lucas any more than we forced restaurants or 
anything else on him; we simply made it available. If he wasn't interested, 
well, there are plenty of happy, healthy kids out there who don't know a 
baseball from a nectarine. But I think baseball offers a child enormous 
opportunities for learning about the concept of the team and individual 
sacrifice, about the dividends of practice and hard work, about how to win -- 
and how to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas didn't learn anything at the first games we took him to, of course, but 
he did stay for the whole game each time, almost as quiet throughout as the 
Dodger bats. By 1991, when he was approaching his second birthday, Lucas was 
old enough to sit in his own seat. Since I have only two season tickets, that 
meant I took him alone, without Lucy. 
</P>
<P>
 We went to four or five games in each of the next three seasons, and he fell 
in love with the hot dogs and ice cream at Dodger Stadium, their resolute 
mediocrity notwithstanding. To my amazement, he never wanted to leave before 
the final out -- not even when the Dodgers trailed, 12-2, in the sixth inning 
once and I wanted to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't sung the ballgame song yet, dad," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He wouldn't leave after the seventh inning stretch and two renditions of "Take 
Me Out to the Ballgame" either, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas liked the singing and the spectacle and the food, but he didn't show any 
real interest in what was happening on the field until we saw catcher Mike 
Piazza hit two home runs in one late-season game last year. 
</P>
<P>
 That instantly turned him into a Dodger fan and a Piazza fan. He mentioned 
Piazza often during the off-season and he frequently asked me when it would be 
April. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when baseball starts, right, Dad?" he said repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
 We went to six or eight games in the truncated 1994 season -- he also went to 
a Dodger-Met game with Lucy -- and Piazza played well every time. After he hit 
a grand slam in one game, Lucas became even more devoted to the Dodgers -- and 
to Piazza. 
</P>
<P>
 When I bought an old set of baseball cards that included Mike Scioscia as the 
Dodger catcher, Lucas said, "Hey, what's he doing? Mike Piazza is the Dodgers' 
catcher." When I asked him in a pizza parlor if he wanted to order a "pepperoni 
Piazza," he got angry with me for daring to take his favorite player's name in 
vain. 
</P>
<P>
 Often Lucas would go into the living room and tilt our throw rug so that it 
represented a baseball diamond. Then he would act out several innings of a 
game. He would announce each player as he came to bat, pretend to pitch and hit 
the ball and then run the bases. He went through the entire lineup, in order, 
then started over. 
</P>
<P>
 Every few seconds, he would come running in to give us a virtual play-by-play 
report -- "Dad, dad, Brett Butler just hit an inside-the-park home run." Since 
his games tended to be high-scoring affairs -- "Mom, mom, the Mets are in 
trouble -- the Dodgers are ahead 18-3 in the second inning" -- the reports were 
often so frequent that Lucy and I had trouble eating, sustaining a conversation 
or reading. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucy and I bought baseball cards for Lucas, and he entertained himself 
endlessly with them. Almost every day, he asked Lucy or me to pitch to him in 
our tiny front yard. As with his game on the living room rug, he would pretend 
to be a different Dodger with each at-bat, proceeding sequentially through the 
entire batting order. If he forgot for a moment that, say, Eric Karros followed 
Tim Wallach, he would make us stop until he pulled the right name out of his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 Like his father, Lucas is not a natural athlete. He swings and misses at most 
of my very soft, very slow, very straight pitches -- even though the last time 
we played, he kept urging me to "throw me a fork ball, daddy," "throw me a 
curve." But -- also like his father -- he plays hard, including headfirst 
slides, with his hand stretched out to touch imaginary bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice -- once as pitcher Tom Candiotti, once as Piazza -- Lucas whacked the 
ball over the short "right field" fence, into the yard of our new neighbors. 
Proud of his "grand slam home runs," he insisted on going with me to retrieve 
the ball. When the neighbors turned out to be pleasant, friendly and interested 
in baseball themselves -- one is a Dodger fan -- Lucas asked if we could invite 
them for Sunday dinner . . . and he then invited them both to his fifth 
birthday party. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lucas isn't blindly loyal to the Dodgers. He has heard me grumbling 
periodically about Manager Tom Lasorda, so he immediately blamed him for the 
strike. I tried to explain that, no, this was one screw-up you couldn't pin on 
Lasorda. 
</P>
<P>
 I am didactic by nature, and I have tried to rein in those impulses when Lucas 
and I are at the ball game or simply talking about baseball. I tell him only 
what he clearly wants to know about the rules and procedures of the game. I 
don't want to confuse him or overwhelm him. I don't want to do anything that 
could diminish his enthusiasm for what is, after all, a simple game of hit and 
run and throw. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas quickly grasped the basic rudiments of the game -- visiting team bats 
first, three strikes and you're out, three outs to an inning, nine innings to a 
game, the manager can bring in pinch-hitters and relief pitchers. When I asked 
him what the Dodgers had to do to get to the World Series next year, he said, 
"Win more games." When I asked what they had to do win more games, he said, 
"Get better players." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lucas isn't ready to take Lasorda's job -- or Fred Claire's -- yet. He 
doesn't really understand the double play, the hit and run, tagging up or the 
infield fly rule. (Come to think of it, maybe he is ready to take Lasorda's 
job.) 
</P>
<P>
 At each game Lucas went to this season, he asked more questions than the last, 
and he quickly developed strong opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 He thought Roger McDowell, not Todd Worrell, should have been the closer, for 
example, and he wanted Henry Rodriguez, not Cory Snyder, to play left field. 
McDowell and Snyder have since been dumped by the Dodgers, but Lucas learned 
early on about the precarious life of a marginal major leaguer. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, he and Lucy and I were having dinner at Primi, a West Side Italian 
restaurant. He left the table at one point and went to sit at the bar between 
two men, both watching the Dodgers on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 When Lucy went to check on him, she found him lecturing the two men: "That's 
Jose Offerman at bat. No. 30. He's a bum." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers shipped Offerman to the minors the next week. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lucas' baseball education has now been interrupted. The baseball owners 
might now be doing what I tried so hard not to do: Turn him off baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a crucial time for Lucas as a potential, long-term baseball fan. He is 
at a point in his young life when baseball could capture him forever. Instead, 
the owners risk alienating him, turning his adoration and devotion into 
feelings of abandonment, betrayal and resentment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, he still is young. I didn't become a baseball fan until I was 9. But 
Lucas is more precocious -- and more mercurial -- than I was as a boy, and he 
has far more alternative forms of entertainment. I'm afraid that the premature 
end to this season, the loss of the playoff and World Series excitement that 
could have cemented his enthusiasm -- and the possible loss of spring training 
and part (or all) of the 1995 season -- could permanently disrupt his interest 
in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 He hasn't expressed any such feelings overtly yet, and Lucy and I tried to 
keep his interest in baseball engaged by letting him watch parts of the 
wonderful Ken Burns series on PBS. (Every time that I or narrator John 
Chancellor described some storied player -- Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, Joe DiMaggio -- 
as one of the greatest ever, Lucas would shake his head vigorously and say, 
"No, Mike Piazza's better, right, dad?") 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, this devotion did not seem to extend much beyond television, 
and for the moment, he seems more eager to play soccer than baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the strike, I had been thinking that when his birthday came, I might 
take Lucas and several friends to Dodger Stadium. Instead, we had 16 of his 
friends to the house for a party and magic show. In addition to the predictable 
assortment of "Lion King" and "Power Ranger" toys and games, gifts from his 
friends included -- among other things -- a Dodger T-shirt, a Dodger warm-up 
jacket, an abridged, "25 Great Moments" book version of the Ken Burns 
"Baseball" series and a book called "If I were a Los Angeles Dodger." 
</P>
<P>
 In the latter, a photo of Lucas appears, in a Dodger uniform, at various 
moments during a critical Dodger-Giant game. The series of photos climaxes with 
"Lucas" hitting a home run to win the Western Division championship. 
</P>
<P>
 On his actual birthday, I told Lucas that in keeping with a family tradition, 
he could choose any restaurant in town for dinner. He chose Primi. The owner 
and his wife and their two young sons are friends, and they all showed up to 
wish Lucas a happy birthday. Lucas had a great time playing with the two boys 
between bites of his Caesar salad, veal T-bone steak and more desserts than you 
could wave a fungo bat at. But when I asked him if he would rather be at Primi 
or Dodger Stadium, he answered, unhesitatingly, "Dodger Stadium." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe all is not lost. Yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Early the next morning, I signed him up for T-ball one afternoon a week at his 
new school.

LOS ANGELES TIMES SPECIAL REPORT / BASEBALL; BITTERSWEET BLUES; CANCELLATION OF 
'94 WORLD SERIES STIRS MEMORIES OF LINK BETWEEN DODGER SUCCESS AND A FAMILY'S 
TRAGEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In my family there is a peculiar and intractable connection between death and 
the World Series. The sad demise of the 1994 fall classic has brought back to 
me the painful events that played out in my life. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1958, the year the Dodgers moved from Brooklyn, my family also moved to 
California. I was 5. Southern California was different then, like a beautiful 
uncongested kingdom with an ocean view and a forgiving climate. The game of 
baseball fit effortlessly into that territory with no seasons, a place where 
the game could go on and on. When baseball moved west it forged a perfect 
union: Los Angeles and the Dodgers. We felt a part of that union and easily, 
unashamedly fell for, maybe even worshiped, the graceful and perfect presence 
of Sandy Koufax. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1963 the Dodgers won the pennant and play the hated Yankees in the World 
series. My father had tickets and was going to his first World Series game. 
Being born and raised in Chicago had severely limited his World Series 
opportunities. On an unforgettable Saturday before the Series began, his father 
died, suddenly. I had just turned 11 and was the only one home that afternoon 
when the phone call came. I had no experience with death, until Western Union 
called. They asked for my father. I told them he was not home and I offered to 
take a message. The operator matter-of-factly read me the telegram from my aunt 
in Chicago saying that my grandfather had died of a heart attack. That was it. 
</P>
<P>
 I walked into the bathroom and when I looked at myself in the mirror, sobs 
came from everywhere in my body. I tried and couldn't wipe away the tears that 
would not stop. Knowing I had to give this horrible news to my father was 
unthinkable. I felt paralyzed. It wold be hours before anyone returned home. 
Helpless and frightened I wandered around that house for what seemed like days, 
crying and agonizing over how to deliver the message. 
</P>
<P>
 I wrote the message down and left it on the dining room table. I backed away 
and stared at the note. A small, white piece of paper lying on a flower-print 
table cloth. It stuck out like obscene graffiti or fetid garbage fouling the 
entire room. I went to hide in the back of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 When I heard our car in the driveway and the ordinary sound of the garage door 
being raised, a sound I'd heard a thousand times, I began shaking. I stood 
trembling in the hall until I knew they'd reached the table where I'd left my 
ugly missive. I moved slowly toward the dining room, anxiety crawling all over 
me. I saw my father reading the message and watched him slowly raise his head, 
a pale, questioning look on his face. I stood immobilized with my cheek 
flattened against the wall, my hands clutching onto the door frame, wishing I 
could think of something to say. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time I saw my father cry and it pained me more than anything 
I can remember from my childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 My father gave away his World Series tickets and he and my mother went to 
Chicago for the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1965, the Dodgers played the Minnesota Twins in the Wrold Series and again 
my dad had tickets. Exactly two years to the day of her husband's death, my 
grandmother died. My father this time received the news personally from his 
sister. Again he had to give away the World Series tickets and again he flew 
with my mom to Chicago for the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 For years my father joked with some sadness that he wouldn't accept World 
Series tickets because he was afraid somebody would die. 
</P>
<P>
 My family's interest in baseball waned over the years, but the Dodger World 
Series victory a remarkable year, staying in first place nearly the whole 
season. With some close friends I in 1981 and a relationship with a 
baseball-addict, rekindled my fever. In 1988 the Dodgers had sat through more 
than 50 games that summer, many of them come-from-behind victories. It was a 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 For a short while, everybody, even his surgeon, was fooled into thinking he 
would be OK. season of baseball triumph and exhilaration. In the middle of it, 
my father was diagnosed with But when he relapsed, they could not help him. My 
watching got a achingly difficult and ultimately we were resigned to the 
inevitable. We knew what was left for him and we couldn't stop it, couldn't 
change it. 
</P>
<P>
 The day my father died, the Dodgers clinched the division. Through the final 
games of the season, I had an eerie, unexplainable feeling that they'd win it 
all. Driving home on the night of my father's funeral I was listening to Game 4 
of the Dodger-New York Met National League championship series and heard 
catcher Mike Scioscia hit a rare two-run homer against Dwight Gooden. It was 
the ninth inning at Shea Stadium and the game was tied, 4-4. When I got home, I 
threw myself on the floor directly in front of the TV, my hands touching the 
screen, using the television as a conduit, feeling the electricity of the game 
course through me. Kirk Gibson hit an extra-inning home run, and the 
unmistakable feeling came over me again: They would win it. Even though he had 
started the day before, Orel Hershiser came in to pitch with two out in the 
12th. Like a piece of video on fast-forward, he threw quickfire fastballs and 
sharp-breaking curves, down and away, retiring Kevin McReynolds on a fly ball 
to center field, saving the game in freezing New York. The series was coming 
back to L.A. I felt an uncomfortable guilt seeping through me as that game 
ended, thinking about my dad. 
</P>
<P>
 In Game 7 the Dodger humiliated the Mets early and won despite my guilt. Being 
there to see the Dodgers win the pennant was the antithesis of being there to 
see my father lose his battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Piled on top of all that elation and sorrow was the most remarkable baseball 
experience of my life. I imagine anyone who was there that night feels the 
same. The Dodgers were down to their last strike in Game One of the World 
Series when a mangled Kirk Gibson made his only appearance of the entire series 
and hit the home run that will be chronicled alongside Carlton Fisk's, Bobby 
Thomson's and Bill Mazeroski's. When the ball sailed high over the stunned Jose 
Canseco, standing far out in right field looking straight up, me and everybody 
in the ball park that night seemed to be anointed with fortune. Gibson rounded 
the bases and surrendered to us a rare and brilliant baseball treasure. A 
friend and I went to my house and opened a $100 bottle of champagne that wasn't 
even chilled. We didn't care. 
</P>
<P>
 Living with that potent, exhilarating sports emotion and balancing it against 
the painful, draining summer of my father's illness was almost perverse for me. 
But it seems now like a blessing, to have been given such an uplifting event to 
help salve the ache of the bitter months. Having been able to share that 
victory however with my father, would have made it much sweeter. But even 
though I would have given anything, most easily the World Series victory, to 
have my father full and healthy, I think he could not have gone in a more 
fitting, symmetrical season. That year the Dodgers surrounded us with 
unspoiled, classic, brilliant baseball. It also reminded me of the unkind and 
bizarre connection between my family and the Dodgers in the World Series. 
Before the 1994 season was ceremoniously bickered to death, the Dodgers were in 
the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if they'd made it to the World Series, that sad old joke is now mine 
and I'd have to wonder about accepting tickets. Somebody might die.

MAN SENTENCED TO 146 YEARS FOR 2 GANG RAPES; COURTS: GILBERT DE LA CRUZ, 20, 
WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE AT AGE 92. HE WAS ONE OF FOUR CHARGED IN THE 
ATTACKS AT COMMUNITY CENTER.

<P>
 A 20-year-old Anaheim man was sentenced to 146 years in prison Friday for his 
part in two separate gang rapes of teen-age girls at a community center, one of 
the longest sentences ever in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert De La Cruz, one of four suspected Anaheim gang members charged in the 
rapes, sat without visible emotion as Superior Court Judge Richard L. 
Weatherspoon announced the sentence. De La Cruz will be eligible for parole at 
age 92. 
</P>
<P>
 His family members sobbed in the courtroom. The victims were not present. 
</P>
<P>
 The two rapes occurred last year at the Anaheim Independencia Community 
Center, where the victims had become separated from their friends, according to 
a court sentencing report. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 12 a 15-year-old girl was held down by several people, and a knife 
was held to her neck while as many as 12 males raped her, the report said.  
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 7, a 14-year-old girl was raped by several people after being left 
behind by her friends about 2:30 a.m., according to the sentencing report. 
After a continued struggle, she was thrown to the ground and knocked 
unconscious, where she remained about three hours. About 10 people watched but 
did nothing when she screamed for help, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 In statements to authorities, De La Cruz admitted that he participated in the 
first rape after smoking methamphetamine, according to the report. He told a 
probation officer it was "the worst thing I ever did by far." 
</P>
<P>
 He denied involvement in the second rape, saying he was at his girlfriend's 
house, according to the sentencing report. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Cruz, whom the judged described as a "serious danger to society," has a 
long juvenile court record and was on probation at the time of the rapes for 
assault with a deadly weapon, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 He faced a maximum 285 years in prison for his conviction of 22 counts of 
rape, using a weapon, and aiding others in a crime, prosecutor Camille Hill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could have stopped at any point in time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only four people in either rape have been identified by the victims or through 
DNA testing, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two juveniles have been sentenced to the California Youth Authority, where 
they cannot be held past age 25, while a third adult is awaiting trial, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In letters to the court, De La Cruz's family said he was remorseful and 
pleaded that he be given a shorter sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 One victim urged the harshest sentence possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is so unfair to me because I can't live a happy normal life like other 
teen-agers," she wrote to the court. "I keep thinking to myself each time I see 
the news or paper that there has been a rape, and I'm one of those statistics."

SHOWING FAITH IN A PRIEST; EDUCATION: MORE THAN 350 PARENTS AND STUDENTS RALLY 
BEHIND FORMER PRINCIPAL MICHAEL HARRIS, ACCUSED OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 At an emotion-filled rally Friday afternoon, more than 350 parents, students 
and alumni of Santa Margarita High School gathered in support of Msgr. Michael 
Harris, the school's former principal, who has been accused by two former 
students of sexual misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point during the 45-minute gathering, an airplane towing a banner in 
support of Harris flew over Santa Margarita Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Harris' absence from the rally, the crowd sang "For He's a Jolly Good 
Fellow," held up signs urging passing cars to honk in support of Harris and 
lined up to speak in defense of the school's founding principal, who they 
contend has been unjustly accused. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills resident Barbara Ortiz's voice quavered as she spoke of Harris, 
whom she called "the backbone of my son's high school career." 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to see anyone accused of something and assumed guilty before any proof 
has been given," Ortiz said. "It's slanderous, a defamation of character and 
it's cruel. It's cruelty." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, 47, had been principal of the school since it opened in 1987. In 
January, he was asked to step down by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange, 
pending the outcome of an investigation into allegations of sexual 
improprieties. When he refused the bishop's order to get counseling, his right 
to "function as a priest" was revoked. 
</P>
<P>
 Those at Friday's rally said they wanted Harris to know that they stand firmly 
behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was there for us when we were hurt or happy," parent Art Birtcher said to 
the crowd. "Now, it's time for us to be with him when he needs us the most." 
</P>
<P>
 Parent Mike Carney said, "This is obviously a lose-lose situation. You have 
someone whose allegations can't be proven, and a man whose denial can't be 
proven. He's denied it and we believe him." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris' departure from the school nine months ago stunned students, parents 
and faculty. In March, officials at the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange 
publicly disclosed that Harris had been accused of "sexual improprieties." 
</P>
<P>
 The first allegations of abuse were made last December by the mother of a 
former student at Santa Ana's Mater Dei High School, where Harris was principal 
from 1978 to 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 More allegations are contained in a lawsuit filed last month in Orange County 
Superior Court by a former Mater Dei student who said Harris abused him during 
school hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris "flatly denies" the allegations, his attorney has said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the rally, students and former students talked of going to Harris' house 
for pizza and dropping by his office after school without ever a hint of 
misbehavior on his part. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it all really hard to believe," said 30-year-old Jeff Kirkpatrick, who 
attended Mater Dei while Harris was principal there. "I knew him very well, 
went on trips, went to his house, and never saw anything remotely close (to the 
allegations). This is all so sad because he's a great man." 
</P>
<P>
 Students said there had been rumors circulating since Harris left but that 
they did not learn the circumstances behind his departure until last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a shock when he left," said 17-year-old Dave Reskey, a senior. "It's 
almost like he ran away from home, leaving his children. I'd just like to tell 
him that he is well-loved by all." 
</P>
<P>
 Said 16-year-old John Nehas, "We lost something when Msgr. Harris left. We're 
not as close together. It's definitely different." 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo City Councilwoman Sharon Cody, whose son, Scott, attends the 
school, was also at the rally." 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a victim," Cody said. "I believe in the end we will find he has done 
nothing wrong. But in the meantime, the real sadness is that his life will 
forever be changed because of this. This is not deserved."

DMV CHIEF HALTS STUDY THAT SHIELDS BAD DRIVERS; SAFETY: ALL REPEAT OFFENDERS 
WILL FACE THE AGENCY'S MOST AGGRESSIVE PROSECUTION, HE PLEDGES IN WAKE OF 
CHRONIC SPEEDER'S FATAL SILVERADO CANYON CRASH. 
</P>

<P>
 Under fire from legislators and members of the public outraged over this 
week's fatal Silverado Canyon car crash, the Department of Motor Vehicles 
announced Friday it will cancel a 20-year-old research project that examines 
whether warning letters keep habitually negligent drivers from causing 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Shane Young, 25, who authorities say was driving in a drag race that turned 
deadly Monday, was unknowingly part of a control group in the study and 
therefore did not have his license suspended earlier this year despite 
receiving five traffic tickets in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Young was released from jail Friday but may still face charges of vehicular 
manslaughter and drunk driving. He also had his license suspended in 1987 and 
was caught twice driving without a valid license before his license was 
reinstated in 1992, DMV records show. 
</P>
<P>
 DMV Director Frank Zolin said Friday that the controversy surrounding the 
Silverado accident prompted him to disband the Negligent Operator Treatment 
Evaluation System, effective Dec. 31, so all repeat offenders will be subject 
to the DMV's most aggressive prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really just seemed unnecessary to continue this ongoing study," Zolin 
said, adding that the DMV will do short-term research projects like NOTES as 
needed. "We do believe the warning letters help, and that's why we don't need 
to do the study anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the chairmen of the state Legislature's transportation committees 
welcomed the move, the DMV's own research director, Raymond Peck, cautioned 
that without the control group it will be tougher to analyze the impact of the 
continuing Negligent Operators Treatment System. 
</P>
<P>
 Peck, who has worked on both of those research programs since their inception 
in 1974, pointed out that in the early 1980s DMV revamped the system for 
warning and suspending bad drivers based on data gathered from the control 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not be able to tell in future years whether these programs are 
effective and whether any future changes in the programs are effective," Peck 
said. "It's easy to say, 'Well, gee, if you had these (control group) people in 
the (prevention) program, there would have been more accidents prevented.' But 
we wouldn't have known" how to do it without the control group. 
</P>
<P>
 Peck and DMV spokesman Bill Madison pointed out that, even if Young had his 
license suspended as he otherwise would have last spring, it likely would have 
been reinstated before this week's accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm convinced that this fatal accident would have occurred no matter what we 
would have done, frankly, because of the nature of this person," Peck said. 
</P>
<P>
 The flap over the NOTES program is the latest in a string of woes for the DMV 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, a state audit said the agency wasted $50 million on a doomed 
computer project, and in January an Orange County jury ordered DMV to pay $4.1 
million to pedestrians who were hit in a crosswalk by a legally blind motorist 
whose driver's license had just been renewed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have no accountability at all," said Christopher Day, the Tustin 
attorney who sued the agency on behalf of the pedestrians. "This isn't the 
first time their computer has fouled up. There is no computer control 
whatsoever. There's no checks and balances in the department." 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) called the 
NOTES program "an abomination" and raised larger concerns about the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the items most people come into contact with DMV on, DMV is doing a better 
job," Katz said. "But there are significant internal problems, such as computer 
problems, that they need to be held accountable for." 
</P>
<P>
 But Zolin, the agency director, pointed out that the jury award is being 
appealed and said that both the computer scandal and the NOTES debacle are 
problems he inherited when taking over as DMV director 3 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he admitted that the high-profile problems have hurt the agency's 
image, Zolin pointed out the department's recent accomplishments: designer 
license plates; magnetic stripes on driver's licenses that allow for easy 
identification; colored stripes identifying drivers under 21 and under 18; and 
a September, 1994, study that showed 65% of the members of the public were 
happier with their most recent DMV contact than the previous one. 
</P>
<P>
 And Zolin stressed that it is impossible for the DMV to prevent accidents -- 
even those caused by people such as Young, who has a long record of speeding 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way we can say we guarantee people aren't going to speed. That's a 
matter of individual responsibility," he said. "We can't protect the public 
from the bad judgment of drivers." 
</P>
<P>
 Legislative leaders, however, said the Young case shows DMV's bad judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Silverado Canyon resident was randomly selected for participation in the 
NOTES program, in which 4% of drivers with two tickets within a year were 
placed into a control group. While the vast majority of these errant drivers 
received letters warning that they would be suspended if they got additional 
violations, those in the control group did not, allowing the DMV to study the 
effectiveness of the warning letters. 
</P>
<P>
 Young's case was even more complicated, because he received five tickets in 
1993 -- which should have prompted immediate suspension of his license -- but 
several of the tickets were processed after he was entered in the NOTES program 
and thus never counted against him. Plus, his earlier record of license 
suspension and tickets from 1987, 1988 and 1991 were not considered, Madison 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obvious DMV is operating on autopilot and not paying enough attention to 
public safety at least as far as their research programs are concerned," Katz 
said. "It makes no sense that anybody would be involved in (the NOTES program) 
with a record like this." 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco), who chairs the Senate 
Transportation Committee, on Friday called NOTES "a very foolish program" and 
praised Zolin for disbanding it. 
</P>
<P>
 "With any mammoth organism there are mistakes," Kopp said. "I think the 
department has improved measurably in terms of service to the customers. . . . 
I applaud the director."

CITY AND COUNTY NEGOTIATORS SEEK JAIL ACCORD; CORRECTIONS: OFFICIALS REPORT 
SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN TALKS THAT COULD CUT SCOPE OF THEO LACY BRANCH 
EXPANSION PROJECT TO AVERT SUIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Desperate to ease jail overcrowding, county officials are prepared to reduce 
the scope of the Theo Lacy Branch Jail expansion to avoid litigation with the 
City of Orange and move ahead with the project. 
</P>
<P>
 City and county negotiators have tentatively agreed on several points, which 
could result in the county not only cutting the number of proposed new jail 
beds but also reducing the number of maximum-security inmates to be housed at 
the facility in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 The county is also willing to offer Orange several economic incentives, 
including a stimulus package for the foundering The City shopping center, 
relocating the county animal shelter and giving the city a waiver of county 
jail booking fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner and Orange City Manager David F. Dixon are lead 
negotiators and have been working for months to resolve the dispute over the 
proposed Theo Lacy expansion. As originally planned, the project would increase 
the number of jail beds at Theo Lacy from 1,326 beds to 4,480, under a 
worst-case scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men said this week that significant progress in the negotiations has been 
made. They said the county and city are willing to compromise to reach an 
out-of-court resolution to the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner said the county is hoping to avoid costly and protracted litigation 
with Orange. He added that the county wants to move ahead on the expansion as 
quickly as possible because of the critical overcrowding problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is, if people are really concerned about their safety, we 
have to have these jail beds and not have people being just cited and 
released," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the county has shown a willingness to reduce the scope of the 
expansion project, Steiner and Dixon said they are still haggling over the 
exact numbers of new jail beds that will be installed at Theo Lacy and the 
precise number of maximum-security inmates who will use them. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the issue of jail beds could be a "deal breaker" if not resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still a ways apart," Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the number of jail beds is not the only issue being discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since the negotiations began last summer, Steiner disclosed 
that the county is also prepared to offer Orange a "multimillion-dollar" 
economic package. That package would include helping the city improve traffic 
circulation around The City mall, financing the $6-million relocation of the 
animal shelter, which the city would be responsible for if the project moves 
forward, and other undisclosed incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 Any settlement of the dispute will have to be legally binding, Steiner and 
Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Theo Lacy jail expansion has been a hotly debated issue throughout the 
county for years. Although county officials and Sheriff Brad Gates have been 
pushing for the expansion, they say they realize that, at best, it is only a 
short-term solution to the lack of jail space in the county. A long-term 
solution, however, seems nowhere in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 In an Aug. 26 letter to county officials, Gates said the overcrowding problem 
was so severe that in the past two years he has been forced to release nearly 
55,000 inmates from jail early. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates has said the state's new "three strikes and you're out" legislation has 
only worsened an unbearable situation in the county's jails. Sheriff's 
officials also have said recent disturbances at the Central Men's Jail in Santa 
Ana and at Theo Lacy are partly due to the packed conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates could not be reached for comment Friday. Steiner said he plans to meet 
with the sheriff next week and brief him on his negotiations with Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Concurrent with the negotiations, the county is proceeding with an 
environmental impact study on the Theo Lacy expansion. Orange officials have 
not sued the county over the expansion project, but say they are prepared to do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have, however, filed a lawsuit over the housing of 
maximum-security inmates at the facility. The city would drop the lawsuit and 
agree not to challenge the expansion project if a settlement is reached, Dixon 
and Steiner said.

STUDENTS STAGE MARCH AGAINST PROPOSITION 187; PROTEST: ESTANCIA HIGH YOUTHS, 
WAVING FLAGS AND SIGNS, LEAVE CAMPUS TO SHOW OPPOSITION TO GOVERNOR'S SUPPORT 
OF MEASURE TARGETING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS .

<P>
 Shouting "viva la raza!" and "Mexico, Mexico, Mexico," a group of about 200 
students from Estancia High School staged a boisterous but peaceful march 
Friday to protest Gov. Pete Wilson's support for Proposition 187, the statewide 
initiative that would deny health care and education to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think Pete Wilson is a racist," said Carlos Hernandez, a junior at 
Estancia who joined his classmates in walking off campus about 12:45 p.m. "I 
think (Proposition 187) is just an excuse to get us (Latinos) out of here." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's wrong," said junior Danny Barajas. "I think Pete Wilson is 
making a big mistake" by supporting Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not treating us like human beings," said Elva Perez, a junior who 
characterized the ballot initiative as discriminatory and racist. 
</P>
<P>
 Some motorists honked their horns in support of the students as they waved 
Mexican flags and protest signs during their nearly three-hour march from 
Estancia to Costa Mesa High School and back. A handful of students from Costa 
Mesa High joined in the protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the passing motorists were supportive of the march, however. "Some 
people were yelling, 'Go back to Mexico,' " said freshman Alma Perez. "They 
were racist." 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa patrol officers followed the marchers, who blocked traffic at times 
as they walked east on Wilson Street from their school on Placentia Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were rather difficult to control, as they were youthful and vigorous in 
their march toward Harbor Boulevard," said Police Lt. Alan Kent. "They ignored 
our commands to get out of the road." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, police corralled the students into a corner of the Harbor Plaza 
shopping center to await the arrival of two school buses from Estancia. But 
before the buses arrived, many of the students broke into a run and continued 
their march back to campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent said no arrests were made. "It was just a lot of annoying the local 
citizens," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Estancia High School Principal Marguerite J. Anatol said she learned about 
plans for the march on Thursday when students distributed a flyer that urged a 
march against Wilson and Proposition 187. Slightly more than half of the 
school's 1,158 students are Latino, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was peaceful, and I'm thankful for that," Anatol said of the march. She 
said those who participated are considered truant for missing afternoon 
classes, and that each student will have to serve two hours of detention. 
</P>
<P>
 "My responsibility is to help maintain a safe and orderly environment -- 
that's my No. 1 concern," said Anatol, who maintained that missing class was 
not the best way to demonstrate their concerns about Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Alvarado, a drug counselor at Estancia, agreed that the march was 
counterproductive. "I tried to tell them not to disrupt their classwork," 
Alvarado said. "Another time and place would have been great." 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarado added that the community's problems with gangs, drugs and graffiti 
would grow far worse if Proposition 187 passes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just going to explode, the deterioration of the neighborhoods," Alvarado 
said. "You're targeting the kids as a vehicle to get to a bigger problem, and 
that's not right. Kids have enough problems right now."PROPOSTITION 187

<P>
 Police arrested an 18-year-old man Friday in connection with the Jan. 20 
murder of a Turtle Rock woman in her home. 
</P>
<P>
 Earl Rhoney, a former Irvine resident, was arrested just before 2 p.m. on 
suspicion of homicide and burglary, according to Lt. Sam Allevato.He was booked 
into the Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of 45-year-old Patricia Lea Pratt was found in her bedroom at the end 
of a cul-de-sac on Windflower by her husband, Paul Pratt, when he returned just 
before midnight from a business meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the killing, police said Patricia Pratt, a service manager for 
PacTel Cellular, may have been bludgeoned to death when she interrupted a 
burglary. Several items of value had been taken from the house, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhoney was arrested after his release from Orange County Juvenile Hall, where 
he was being held on a burglary charge, Allevato said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police would not say what linked Rhoney to the crime that rocked the 
community.  
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said Pratt had been killed, probably with blows to the upper 
torso, sometime between 5:30 and 11:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers distributed more than 400 flyers in the neighborhood following 
the killing in hopes that witnesses would provide them with some leads.  
</P>
<P>
 Pratt's death was the fourth homicide in Irvine since 1990. MARK I. PINSKY

 Last fall, Casey Kennedy was struggling to find child care for his three 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 And the single father's financial situation was so grim that celebrating 
Christmas was impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 But a cooperative program between Orange County Social Services and Placentia 
schools led social worker Deborah Moodie to Kennedy, 42, with offers of 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within 48 hours of Deborah contacting me, I had my . . . children in day 
care," said Kennedy, a truck driver. "She even helped me get some clothes and 
gifts for my kids for Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 Under a grant program called Healthy Start, begun last year, Moodie and fellow 
social worker Rosalinda Sanchez are assigned to Kraemer Middle School and Ruby 
Drive Elementary School. They also work with families from several other 
schools in the south Placentia area. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrangement is designed to give school staff and social workers better 
access to each other, which should result in more preventive referrals and 
fewer cases of child abuse, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since January, 1993, the Placentia schools have referred 88 families to Moodie 
and Sanchez. The social workers also frequently give informal assistance to 
teachers and staff members concerned about students. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding for Healthy Start comes from a three-year state grant. The program, in 
its third year, will receive about $92,000 for the current school year. In 
addition, several county and state agencies provide personnel, such as the 
social workers, a nurse practitioner and counselors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have seen a decline in the number of cases of serious child abuse" in the 
area served by the program, said Ken Levine, head of the program. "We're 
getting to these families before the situation becomes the outrageous story in 
the newspaper." DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

<P>
 At least one school board member has not given up on building a $1.2 million 
stadium at the planned Northwood High School, even though Irvine Unified School 
District budget managers say the district can't afford it. 
</P>
<P>
 When the new $51-million high school opens in the fall of 1997, it will have 
athletic fields, a gymnasium, athletic courts and locker rooms.But plans to 
construct a 5,000-seat stadium, 50-meter pool, an additional gymnasium and 
three tennis courts are on hold because of their $3.9-million price tag. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Tom Burnham warned fellow school board members of a "taxpayer revolt" 
when homeowners discover they are paying higher taxes to fund a school with 
incomplete facilities. Burnham said architectural plans showing a stadium at 
the school are misleading. "We need to be real upfront and honest about what we 
can do at this site," Burnham said. 
</P>
<P>
 He has proposed shifting funds from a 600-seat theater planned for the school 
to construction of a stadium. Burnham said the district should also consider 
using funds earmarked for future construction projects to pay for the 
additional athletic facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 With expectations of continuing shortages in school construction money, school 
board member Margie Wakeham suggested sharing buildings and programs with the 
nearby Tustin Unified School District and other local organizations. High 
school juniors and seniors could travel to other locations for programs that 
are too expensive to be offered at all schools, according to Wakeham. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it would work, but I do know we don't have the money to do 
the things we need to do," Wakeham said. "It's misleading to tell the community 
we're going to build a high school that is comprehensive." RUSS LOAR

 Residents who put up signs in the public right of way will now be subject to a 
$5 fine by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 And if they are caught again, they will be fined $250. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved the fines this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-sign ordinance was passed in July, after city crews had to take down 
numerous signs that posed traffic hazards because they were posted on telephone 
and utility poles and other places in the public right of way. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Will B. King objected to the sign ordinance during a public hearing. 
He said he thought residents should be able to put up garage sale signs and 
similar signs because the advertising, while rudimentary, usually brings them 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people depend on these signs for money on the weekend," he said. 
"For them, it means a few extra bucks and dinner on the table. And what about 
the candidates who put up their signs? What are you going to do about the 
candidates who don't take down their signs? 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Thomas Kathe said nobody will be favored when it comes to enforcing 
the sign ordinance. He said residents are allowed to erect signs on private 
property. TOM RAGAN

<P>
 In a sparsely attended forum this week, eight candidates for two City Council 
seats agreed on one thing -- they'll do all they can to fight plans to locate a 
commercial or cargo airport at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 But during the hourlong forum at Shepherd of the Hills Church, the candidates 
also offered differing views on other issues from open space and crime to youth 
activities and local business patronage that the next City Council should 
consider. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Councilwoman Patricia C. Bates, 54, told the audience of about 30 
that she wants to continue the city's fiscal conservatism and build on her 
record of creating more parks and expanding recreation classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Miller, a 53-year-old mortgage loan consultant, also emphasized the need 
for maintaining city revenue, especially by encouraging residents to shop 
locally and by creating a healthy business climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Councilman Paul M. Christiansen, 43, said he hopes to ensure the city 
doesn't lose park and other funds to the county or state governments, which 
often use local money in balancing their own budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other candidates, Richard Taylor, 52, Mary Ann F. Malamut, 35, and 
Planning Commissioner Linda Lindholm, 42, used the forum to reiterate their 
focus on youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor wants to develop more local recreation activities for teen-agers and 
Malamut would like the city to work closely with schools and involve senior 
citizens in children's lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindholm said she would take a close look at proposals such as skateboard 
parks for teen-agers, and that her approval of two child day-care centers while 
on the commission shows her dedication to young people and their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate Greg Cox, 46, a small-business owner, said he wants to create an 
economic development commission to attract more businesses and a youth 
commission to find ways to entertain youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Rose, a 56-year-old engineer who twice has run unsuccessfully for the 
council, blasted the current council for what he termed "cronyism" and 
"corruption," saying he wants to return "integrity" to city government and 
protect the city's open spaces.LYNN FRANEY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ANAHEIM; THREE SUITS CHALLENGE REVITALIZATION PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two school districts and a local homeowners group filed lawsuits Friday 
seeking to derail Anaheim's highly touted $172.5-million revitalization plan 
for the Disneyland area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim City School District, the Anaheim Union High School District and a 
local community group called HOME all filed separate lawsuits in Orange County 
Superior Court charging that Anaheim's environmental impact report fails to 
comply with state environmental guidelines.On Thursday, the city of Garden 
Grove filed a similar suit.  
</P>
<P>
 The four suits claim the massive overhaul of the 550 acres around Disneyland 
-- which will allow up to 16,000 new hotel rooms -- will overburden schools and 
street capacity, diminish nearby property values and erode air quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim officials, who have been expecting the litigation, said the lawsuits 
were without merit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm confident we followed all the necessary legal procedures," said Anaheim 
City Atty. Jack White.  
</P>
<P>
 The project is expected to generate 18,000 new jobs and will likely attract 
thousands of new families to Anaheim and surrounding communities. The new 
project will create a flood of new students at the two school districts, 
leaving them unable to provide suitable classroom space or enough teachers, the 
districts claim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our beef is that they chose to really put a greater premium on high-rise 
hotels than schools," said John Brown, a Riverside attorney representing both 
school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim city officials have acknowledged most of the adverse impacts including 
those on local schools, but argued during the resort plan's approval process 
that the financial benefits outweighed environmental concerns. Upon completion, 
the area is expected to produce an extra $4 million to $6 million in annual 
city revenues. MARTIN MILLER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: BREA; SCHOOL DISTRICT OKS GRADE-CHANGE POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Brea Olinda Unified School District this week approved a policy 
prohibiting any district employee or trustee from changing a student's grade 
without a written or verbal explanation from the teacher who assigned the 
grade. 
</P>
<P>
 The new policy comes after months of investigation into a grade-changing 
scandal in which hundreds of Brea Olinda High School students' grades were 
altered without teacher approval -- an illegal practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the Orange County Department of Education, which was asked to 
investigate, released a report last week saying that widespread confusion about 
policies and job responsibilities plagued the high school during the time when 
student grades were changed. 
</P>
<P>
 They also suggested that the school board draft clear policies to prevent 
further confusion. MIMI KO

<P>
 Cypress looks like a typical suburb today. But 100 years ago, the city 
consisted mostly of flat grassland. 
</P>
<P>
 At the turn of the century, the area was known as Waterville because of the 
artesian wells used by sugar beet farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1895, officials named a school at Moody Avenue and Ball Road "Cypress 
School." It is unclear how the school got its name, because there were no trees 
on the campus at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 From the mid-1940s until 1965, Cypress was known for its dairy farms. The 
average ratio of cows to people was 10,000 to 1 during this period. 
</P>
<P>
 As dairy farming became less profitable in the 1960s, the cows were slowly 
moved out, and homes were built. Today 
</P>
<P>
 A series of business workshops will be held to commemorate Orange County Small 
Business Tax Day. 
</P>
<P>
 The free workshops will begin at 10 a.m. and continue throughout the day at 
the Robert B. Moore Theatre at Orange Coast College, 2701 Fairview Road in 
Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers from the State Board of Equalization, Franchise Tax Board and 
Internal Revenue Service will be on hand.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: BUENA PARK; THE LONG ARM OF PRINCIPAL HORTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Emery Elementary School Principal Jerry Horton does not want to run into his 
former students on his second job. He is more likely to have to slap handcuffs 
on them than ask them how their college search is going. 
</P>
<P>
 Horton patrols the city as a reserve police officer. The unpaid job is both a 
way to provide community service and to fulfill a yearning he has had since 
childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Academia was not his first-choice, he said. He was dazzled by the guns and 
sirens of his police officer uncle and he pursued the career until his 5-foot-6 
inch frame failed him on a height test. 
</P>
<P>
 So Horton, now 49, started up the education ladder. He taught sixth grade at 
Corey Elementary, then became a vice principal at Buena Park Junior High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he disliked the disciplinary duties of that job, it put him in 
contact with officers who told him about Buena Park's reserve officer force. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen years ago -- and after women had started joining police departments 
and height scales no longer applied -- Horton joined up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went there the first day in my principal clothes and they made us jump down 
and do push-ups," he recalled with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes followed for four months on criminal codes, domestic violence, 
driving, hand-to-hand combat and shooting. Training was a mini-version of the 
regular force. He went to work in La Palma for nine years before transferring 
to Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
 On the job, he has dealt with the sadness of trying to save a dying infant and 
the thrill of taking criminals off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Horton said he does not have to change his mood much when he goes directly 
from his principal's office to the patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're basically the same job," he said. "You do a lot of listening and you 
try to diffuse the situation. . . . My mode doesn't change until someone 
changes it."LESLEY WRIGHT

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; A WEEKEND SLATE OF FOUNDERS' FESTIVITIES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Founders' Day, celebrated on and off for decades, has become an annual event 
at last. This weekend will be the first time the city holiday has been observed 
two years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders hope today's carnival at McGaugh Elementary School will build 
enthusiasm for the Founder's Day Parade on Main Street on Oct. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the city's incorporation in 1915, Founders' Day celebrations have been 
sporadic at best. "We had a 75th anniversary celebration in 1990," said Mayor 
George Brown. "That was a real big whoop-de-do and kind of got the ball 
rolling." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Founders' Day events raised $4,500 for the refurbishment of city 
parks. This year's proceeds will also be donated to the city Parks and 
Recreation Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown credits Founders' Day chairwoman Dorothy Whyte for making the holiday an 
annual event. City leaders hope the celebration will bring residents together 
in what has become a diverse community that includes a beach city, Leisure 
World and the Naval Weapons Base. 
</P>
<P>
 The PTA carnival at McGaugh Elementary School runs from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
today. On Oct. 30, Founder's Day events begin at 11 a.m. on the greenbelt in 
downtown Seal Beach, with the Main Street parade beginning at noon.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: TUSTIN; NEW SPORTS PARK WILL ACCOMMODATE BASEBALL TOO 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move to increase recreational opportunities for local teen-agers, the 
City Council has directed that Tustin Sports Park be modified to accommodate 
both softball and hardball games. 
</P>
<P>
 The council action Monday drew applause from supporters of the Senior Little 
League baseball program for 13- to 17-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for the new park, where construction is about 70% complete, had called 
for three softball fields to be built along Jamboree Road and Robinson Drive. 
Now the middle and largest field will be converted into a dual-use facility for 
baseball and softball. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the only city I know of in Orange County that doesn't have a (hardball) 
facility," said Councilman Jim Potts, who was joined by the other council 
members in calling for the park modifications. 
</P>
<P>
 According to city estimates, it will cost up to $20,000 to enlarge the infield 
and alter the sprinkler system, and up to $60,000 to install an outfield screen 
to keep batted balls from flying into traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have money in our budget," said Councilwoman Tracy Worley, who called for 
even more support of the local baseball program. She asked city staff members 
to examine the feasibility of converting one or both of the remaining fields 
into dual-use facilities.ALAN EYERLY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; $1.3-MILLION GRANT WILL GO TO SHELTERS, FOOD 
CHARITIES 
</P>

<P>
 Orange County will receive a $1.3-million federal grant to help charity groups 
pay for food and housing for the poor, officials announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant, provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, is part of a 
12-year national program that distributes as much as $131 million annually to 
supplement shelter and food programs throughout the United States, said FEMA 
spokesman Mark Wolfson. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant, based on such factors as poverty rates and unemployment, is 
intended to help local social service agencies in dealing with the increasing 
number of people needing services. 
</P>
<P>
 Social workers say they are seeing more people who didn't need assistance 
several years ago -- families with two incomes, for instance.  
</P>
<P>
 "The rent alone will eat up their paychecks," said Capt. Lee Lescano, who 
oversees the food and housing programs for the Salvation Army in Orange County. 
"Where are they going to get money for food?" 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Mader, director of the outreach program at Catholic Charities, said she 
has put engineers, accountants and small-business owners in temporary shelters 
over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just need a breather to get back on their feet," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's grant is part of $21.8 million allocated to California, 
Wolfson said. Los Angeles County received $6.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.3 million will be disseminated in Orange County by a board made up of a 
coalition of charity groups. Information about the grants can be obtained 
through the American Red Cross-Orange County by calling (714) 835-5381, Ext. 
275. Applications from nonprofit groups will be accepted through Nov. 7. THAO

HUFFINGTON STRIKES A CHORD WITH SENIORS; POLITICS: THE U.S. SENATE CANDIDATE

 About 450 Leisure World residents cheered, some giving U.S. Senate candidate 
Mike Huffington a standing ovation, as he and more than a dozen other 
Republican candidates addressed the crowd Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, accompanied by his wife, Arianna, two daughters, mother and 
mother-in-law, stressed family values and a reduced role for government during 
a brief speech at the rally. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem we have in America today . . . cannot be solved by the federal 
government," he said. "It must be solved by families, the community. All of you 
remember your parents instilling in you certain virtues . . . responsibility 
for your actions, courage, compassion and faith. We must instill virtues in our 
kids . . . so they get a good education, they can get jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 His position struck a chord with Alice Chandler, 66. "He talks about the 
values that I was raised with," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington was warmly received by the audience, who had greeted previous 
candidates with polite applause, but cheered at his appearance in the 
clubhouse, which was lined with hand-lettered signs supporting the Republican 
slate. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing with Huffington were members of Orange County's Assembly and 
congressional delegations, as well as others running for statewide office. 
Among them were lieutenant governor candidate Cathie Wright, state treasurer 
candidate Matt Fong and secretary of state candidate Bill Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Some in the crowd hissed at the mention of Huffington's opponent, Democratic 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who Huffington criticized for what he called her role in 
increasing taxes. "She and I are like night and day. . . . I want to leave your 
money in your pockets, to pay off your mortgages, to send your grandchildren to 
school . . . to give to the local church." 
</P>
<P>
 He drew applause from the crowd when he alluded to his position against 
integrating seniors-only housing with residents of all ages. "I will make sure 
it can survive, if that's what you want," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue was close to many in the audience. "I feel he wants to think of the 
people first and not necessarily to get in office and get what he can for 
himself," said Ethel Counts, 77. "I support his stance on senior citizens-only 
housing. We have rights too. We have earned our time." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington made no mention of a topic that was on the minds of many of his 
listeners, Proposition 187, the statewide initiative that aims to cut off 
government services to illegal immigrants. Only the day before, Huffington 
announced that he endorsed the measure, saying illegal immigration is a strain 
on the state's infrastructure and services. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very important to me," Chandler and many others said as they left. 
"Illegal immigration is a big problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Cele Nachinson, 80, a Democrat, waited in the shade outside for her husband, a 
die-hard Republican. She reflected many voters when she said she was fed up 
with campaign tactics used in the closely fought Senate race, the costliest one 
in congressional history, with the candidates spending a total of $27 million 
so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "My heart is sick at the dirty barbs that each of them are giving," she said. 
"Can't they talk about what they are trying to accomplish instead of saying, 
'Huffington is a louse, Feinstein is a louse'? It's like we are voting for the 
lesser of two evils instead of looking at the person."

LOCAL ELECTIONS / LAGUNA HILLS CITY COUNCIL; 6 VIE FOR 3 SEATS AS YOUNG TOWN 
CHARTS SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Shaking up government may be the buzzword in politics this electoral season, 
but it is very rarely mentioned in connection with the City Council race here. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, no hot-button issues have emerged, with all but one of the candidates 
for the three open seats saying they want to maintain the city as it is -- 
generally devoid of crime, graffiti and budget problems since its 1991 
incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
 Six candidates, including Mayor R. Craig Scott and Councilman Randal J. 
Bressette, are vying for the seats. And a recent cable television debate, 
expected to be the sole candidates' forum of the race, only attracted four of 
the candidates: Scott, Bressette, Cindy Greengold and Saeid Hariri. Candidates 
Grant Marcus and Charmane Riggs did not attend. 
</P>
<P>
 The next council will have several important issues to consider. Residents 
have complained about poor library service, since Laguna Hills has neither a 
county branch library nor its own city library. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members will also determine how quickly the city administration should 
grow and the breadth of programs and services the young city will provide its 
citizens. So far, the council has taken a conservative approach to expanding 
government services, introducing programs only when there is a strong showing 
of support. The city's staff has been kept at only 14 employees. The city has 
an operating budget of $8.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills council members will be involved with plans for civilian reuse of 
the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station once the military leaves the base in 1999. 
In addition, the city is still negotiating with the county over whether it can 
annex north Laguna Hills. The county has opposed the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott and Bressette -- the incumbents who were elected simultaneous with 
incorporation -- are campaigning on their record of accomplishments, including 
new athletic fields and recreation programs, park improvements and a 
$4.2-million budget reserve. Both said they want to increase safety in the city 
and continue the privatization of services, which the two credit for the city's 
solid financial picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman L. Allan Songstad Jr., declined to run again, saying he is 
satisfied that he had helped the city of 22,000 establish itself through his 
one term on the council. He has endorsed Scott, Bressette and Greengold. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the non-incumbents, only Greengold has political experience in the city. 
The 41-year-old medical office administrator and registered nurse sits on the 
Parks and Recreation Commission and was heavily involved in the city's 
incorporation effort. 
</P>
<P>
 She also is co-chair of the Laguna Hills chapter of Taxpayers for Responsible 
Planning, an organization fighting Measure A, which would require conversion of 
El Toro into a commercial airport. She said she wants to expand recreation 
opportunities and keep the community safe. 
</P>
<P>
 The sole voice of dissatisfaction is Hariri, 39, a property manager. His 
campaign has focused on promises to gain library service for the city and to 
take steps to keep gangs and drugs out of Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate Marcus, 26, is a real estate broker who said in his ballot statement 
that he wants to meet residents' needs by protecting the beauty, safety and 
integrity of the "fine city" of Laguna Hills. He declined to return phone 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Riggs, who did not list her age on filing papers, describes herself as a 
homemaker with six children and 16 grandchildren who has lived in Laguna Hills 
for 22 years. Like Marcus, she praised the city in her ballot statement as a 
"wonderful community" that she wants to protect from the intrusion of drugs, 
gangs, homelessness and traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 Riggs' campaign has raised the most money so far, receiving $4,056 in loans 
from Riggs' husband, but no other monetary contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott has raised $3,469, including $1,650 in personal loans, while Bressette 
has raised $1,575, with $950 of that in personal loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Greengold's campaign chest so far has $2,350, with $1,700 of that money coming 
from personal loans from herself or her husband. Marcus reported garnering 
$1,000 contributions from two companies, the Robison Co. in Laguna Hills and 
Los Angeles-based Western States Technologies.

SUSPECT IN FATALITY RELEASED BUT INVESTIGATION CONTINUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 County authorities on Friday released a 25-year-old man whose car struck and 
killed a pedestrian Sunday in Silverado Canyon, saying they need more time to 
prepare charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to free Shane Young from Orange County Jail came after California 
Highway Patrol investigators presented their evidence Friday to a prosecutor, 
who decided the investigation was not thorough enough, said CHP spokeswoman 
Angel Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Dist. Atty. Steve Perk asked the CHP to re-interview witnesses and 
wait for the results of a toxicology report, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report is expected to show whether Young was under the influence of drugs 
or alcohol when his car struck Jasmin Cook, 20, and two other people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were surprised and very disappointed," Johnson said. "But we hope to ask 
for charges to be filed at a later date, possibly in a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities had expected to arraign Young Friday in Central Municipal Court in 
Santa Ana on charges of vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence and felony 
driving under the influence. The first charge carries a prison sentence of four 
to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires that a suspect be released if charges have not been filed 
within two working days. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson could not say what witnesses need to be re-interviewed, or what 
evidence is lacking. She said the decision by the prosecutor not to file 
charges was unusual in such a high-profile case. 
</P>
<P>
 Young was arrested last Sunday after he struck three people on narrow 
Silverado Canyon Road while racing another driver, police said. The second 
driver, Clint Wamsley, 19, also was arrested and has been released. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash killed Cook and injured her two companions, Shane Graham, 19, and 
Timothy Smart, 21. Most of those involved in the crash were friends and 
neighbors in the tight-knit community of Silverado Canyon. Young and Cook were 
particularly good friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook's sister and aunt said they support authorities' efforts to get to the 
truth of the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want them to investigate until they have a real answer, one that will 
stand up in court," said Cook's aunt, Georgia Spence of Lake Forest, as she 
placed flowers near the roadside spot where her niece was killed.  
</P>
<P>
 Spence said that she and other family members bear Young no grudge. "He's 
already received a lifelong sentence. I'm sure the first thing he thinks about 
when he wakes up is 'Jasmine' and when he goes to sleep at night and is tossing 
and turning, it's 'Jasmine, Jasmine, Jasmine.' "

PLAN WOULD PUT OUTLET MALL AT THE CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An East Coast developer believes that the aging and troubled The City mall 
should be replaced with a 1-million-square-foot mall filled with 12 anchor 
stores and 169 retail shops. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not yet certain that Mills Corp., a privately held company based in 
Washington, will ever build the project described early this year in documents 
filed with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mills is currently in negotiations with the site's owners and we still view 
it as a good, viable (project)," Kent Digby, Mills senior vice president, said 
Friday. "And, as far as we know, there are no other developers looking at this 
potential site." 
</P>
<P>
 According to county and city officials, negotiations over the expansion of 
nearby Theo Lacy Branch Jail include a possible economic stimulus package for 
Orange that would help the city improve traffic circulation around The City 
shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 How the stimulus package would fit in with plans for the mall are not clear, 
but documents filed with the SEC showed that Mills was considering a factory 
outlet center similar to four centers it already operates in Fort Lauderdale, 
Fla., Chicago, Philadelphia and suburban Washington, D.C. Mills also is 
considering a similar outlet mall in Ontario. Independently, a Century City 
developer has unveiled plans to build two competing outlet centers in Carson 
and Colton. 
</P>
<P>
 Some retail industry observers doubt that even the heavily populated Southern 
California region could support more than two of the large outlet centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills' SEC filing showed that the company faces several obstacles: It lost 
money in each of the past four years and, like many development companies, it 
has a heavy debt load. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, developers have been building factory outlet centers in 
out-of-the-way locations such as Barstow and Cabazon near Palm Springs, where 
manufacturers can sell their wares without alienating full-price retailers 
clustered in regional shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent years, some developers have begun considering urban locations 
for the outlet centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Value Retail News, a trade publication, suggests that U.S. consumers are 
hungry for bargains like those found at outlet centers, which feature the likes 
of Levi Strauss, Patagonia, Bugle Boy, Nike and Izod. While conventional 
retailing has grown slowly, sales at outlet stores grew to $8.3 billion in 
1992, according to the most recent figures available, up 12% from $7.4 billion 
the previous year.

SCHOOL DAMAGES RULED OUT IN IQ TEST DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge ruled Friday that a Laguna Hills girl who was denied an 
intelligence test because she is African American can't sue a local school 
district for damages, because school officials were following state mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ruling from U.S. District Judge Ronald S.W. Lew does allow Wendy 
Strong, and her 7-year-old daughter, Brianna Combash, to seek an order 
preventing the Saddleback Valley Unified School District from denying IQ tests 
to African American students, according to their lawyer, R. Brian Oxman. 
</P>
<P>
 While Oxman said the ruling brings some moral vindication to the family since 
it allows them to try to prevent what they believe is "invidious racial 
discrimination," they are disappointed that the school district can't be held 
accountable for damages. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials could not be reached for comment late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The action is the latest in the long-controversial debate over IQ tests and 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision clears the way for a 
federal judge to decide whether a 15-year-old ban giving IQ tests to African 
American students to determine if any should be placed in "mentally retarded" 
classes still applies, given the current array of special-education programs. 
</P>
<P>
 While that decision was seen as a victory for a small group of black parents 
who have challenged a statewide ban on using the tests to place blacks in 
special-education classes, it did not resolve claims of racial bias in the 
tests nor the question of whether they should be available to families who want 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 In Brianna's case, the family alleged that the Saddleback Valley Unified 
School District failed to provide adequate and fair testing because of her 
race. Strong is white, while Brianna's father is African American. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit arose last year when Brianna, who was struggling in school, sought an 
IQ test to identify possible learning problems.

 Good night, baseball. See you in another 50 years, Cleveland. The Gashouse 
Gang, the Boys of Summer, the Lumber Company, the Whiz Kids, the Bronx Bombers, 
the Big Red Machine....Home Run Baker, Bobby Thomson, Ty Cobb, Pie Traynor, 
Teddie Ballgame, Joltin Joe...a nation turns its lonely eyes to you. Thanks for 
the memories, Bambino Willie, Reggie and The Mick. Ain't gonna be no pennant 
race this year; sorry, Don Mattingly, no chants of Yes We Can" or "We Are 
Family" or "The Giants Win The Pennant!" 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks anyway, Billy Buck, Mickey Owen, Fred Merkle, Donnie Moore...you gave 
us your best and we forgive you. Ain't gonna be no Mark Lemkes this year, or 
any Bucky Dents or Pepper Martins or Bill Mazeroskis. No Fall Classic. No 
called shots. No pinch homes. No perfect games. Not even a bench-clearing brawl 
to look forward to. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners and players be damned, I don't care whose fault it is. This game is my 
heritage, and my love for it is a birthright; my dad told me so, and his dad 
told him. What are we to tell our kids? So much for mystique, folklore, 
tradition: the crack of the bat, the smell of leather and fresh-cut grass, 
shiny new baseballs and sharply lined basepaths, peanuts and Cracker Jack. 
Remember how it felt to put on eye black when you were 9? Remember your first 
pair of spikes? Digging in? Leading off? The national pastime has been trashed. 
My condolences, America. We will never be the same.

 I am only 16, but I have enjoyed baseball all my life. I went to the World 
Series when I was 3 and I played Little League. I tried out for my school's 
baseball team, and when I didn't make it, I tried out the next year. I do all 
this because I love the game. That's why it upsets me when players who average 
more than $1 million a year go on strike and ruin the entire season. Baseball 
survived wars, depressions and other catastrophes, but was stopped by something 
worse than them all...greed. I think when next season comes around, if there is 
one, all of us fans should go on strike. Our top demand should be for an 
"expense cap," limiting the amount a family can spend going to see game. But we 
won't do this. We'll still go to the ballparks and cheer through nine innings 
of excitement because we love the game. Unfortunately, the players don't.

 When I was 10, I used to lie awake at night spellbound by the voice of Vin 
Scully painting the heroics of Koufax vs. Gibson or Drysdale vs. Larry Jaster. 
As a transplant from St. Louis, I saw the Cardinals as my heroes. At 10, 
baseball was a simple game in a complex world that made no sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, at 40, I watch as they defile baseball in a complex war that makes no 
sense. I hate (yes, hate) Bud Seaslug, Donald Fear, every owner and every 
player for driving a knife into the heart of the baseball dreams of every 
10-year-old boy across America. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoard your millions, Mr. Player and Mr. Owner, while you can. Just remember 
who pays the bills around here. And bang the drum slowely...for the death of 
innocence.

LANCASTER: VITAL BLEND OF STAR PAST, PRESENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 To the end of his days, Burt Lancaster was tough, outspoken, liberal, private, 
a working actor and, not least, a man who knew he was a superstar and accepted 
it without needing to declare it. 
</P>
<P>
 He was, in fact, one of that fast-diminishing population of movie stars who 
are links to a sharply different Hollywood, when the studios were still major 
and television only a storm cloud on a very distant horizon, and the great 
stars had the status of lesser gods and the riches of royalty. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not only that, as Gloria Swanson says in "Sunset Boulevard," "We had 
faces then" -- although Lancaster's face and his flashing teeth were 
identifiable, uncaptioned, in the farthest corners of the world -- it was that 
the stars of an earlier era, or the stars who became superstars, like 
Lancaster, carried a special aura. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an aura they had earned by mastering the most difficult of all the 
Hollywood arts, survival. Lancaster and the relatively few others in the 
pantheon with him had acquired their status by long-term and frequent exposure 
in films that were good more often than bad, and by many personal appearances, 
many columns and fan magazine profiles and stacks of news items about their 
slightest doings. 
</P>
<P>
 In a much-used but relevant phrase, Lancaster paid his dues, commencing as a 
vaudeville acrobat. He once recalled that he had been the bottom man in the 
pyramid on a vaudeville bill in a Buffalo theater -- a bill headlined by Harry 
James' orchestra and his new singer, Frank Sinatra. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Jimmy Cagney, who once thanked "that touch of the gutter" without which 
his career would not have been possible, Lancaster grew up tough in the Bronx. 
He seemed always to carry himself with something of the cocky swagger of a kid 
who had held his own on mean streets and was not about to concede anything to 
anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the same kid acquired a love of opera because the neighborhood was full of 
Italians and there was always Caruso on the night air (competing with John 
McCormack, whose tenor soared from the Victrolas in the Irish apartments). One 
of Lancaster's last major appearances was as the Phantom's father, a role 
created for a television version of "Phantom of the Opera." It was filmed in 
Paris and gave Lancaster a chance to hear plenty of glorious singing, a 
principal love of his life. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 All of the places Lancaster had been, so to speak, came together in "Elmer 
Gantry," the film and the role for which he will likely be longest remembered. 
Gantry had Lancaster's charismatic showmanship, and the street smarts and the 
swagger, the Irish tongue of the Lancaster clan, and a sudden tenderness that 
could be read as part of the legacy of the kid who liked opera and saved money 
to attend the Met. 
</P>
<P>
 There was another side of the private Lancaster -- sensitive, intellectually 
curious, widely read, concerned about social issues. It was the Lancaster seen 
in "Judgment at Nuremberg," "Birdman of Alcatraz" and Luchino Visconti's "The 
Leopard" -- the film and performance of which he was always proudest. 
</P>
<P>
 He died Thursday night at the age of 80 in the Century City high-rise 
condominium that he'd had decorated in the Mexican style, with wonderful tile 
floors, fine pieces of furniture and art that reflected not a decorator's taste 
but the loving eye of a discerning collector. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most of the fine actors who, in a sense, live to act quite as much as 
they act to live well, Lancaster never really thought of retirement as a viable 
idea. He was bitterly disappointed to lose the title role in "The Old Gringo" 
for health reasons, not least because his involvement had gone so far as 
costume fittings. The film was a failure, which was scant consolation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster managed the star actor's most difficult trick -- being immediately 
identifiable as the star he was and yet cloak himself so thoroughly in a 
characterization that for the duration of a film he became that character: the 
cowboy, the lifer taming birds, the Army major in the earliest stages of the 
U.S. presence in Vietnam in the excellent but little-seen "Go Tell the 
Spartans." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no shortage of gifted actors in the industry. But the concatenation 
of circumstances that produced Burt Lancaster no longer really exist in the 
society or in Hollywood. Few actors have done so much good work over so wide a 
range for so long. Few actors, it seems quite possible to say, will ever have 
the chance to do as much again. 
</P>
<P>
 So the melancholy farewells are to the fine actor, to the exemplary private 
man and to the symbol of a nearly vanished time.
