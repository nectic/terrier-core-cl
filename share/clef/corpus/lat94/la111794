 Attention, Democrats: For those feeling a massive buildup of frustrations, 
Philip Proctor points out you can always try I Scream. Proctor noticed the 
Fairfax Avenue business in a mini-mall, which offers a room where you can cut 
loose vocally for a buck a minute. (We presume the same rate prevails for rock 
singers.) 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, proprietor Carline Silva operates I Scream by telephone 
appointment only, so don't get the idea you can just walk up to the front door 
and yell for her to let you in. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 One who screamed: Some skeptics might question the need for such a sanctuary 
as I Scream. What about the great outdoors?  
</P>
<P>
 Well, we're reminded of a friend who delved into something called primal 
scream therapy when it was fashionable in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Having rented a mountain cabin, he walked into the wilderness one evening and 
let loose with a truly great yell. To his surprise, it was answered by a truly 
primal cry -- resembling that of a mountain lion. Our friend fled to his cabin, 
terrified of whether he had uttered something in lion talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Had he insulted the cat? Or, worse yet, extended a romantic invitation? For 
the remainder of the evening, he was as quiet as a mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We hate to see him lose a chance for that $5-a-day stipend: One juror 
candidate for a murder trial in Downtown L.A. (no, not that murder trial) was 
asked about his occupation. He mentioned that he had helped write several 
pieces of criminal law legislation. And, so, the court thanked and excused 
state Sen. Art Torres. Ironically, Democrat Torres will have a lot of time on 
his hands soon, inasmuch as he was beaten in the insurance commissioner's race. 
</P>
<P>
 "First Tuesday and now this," Torres said. "I am going to have to go see a 
counselor to deal with the rejection." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe I Scream could help. 
</P>

 The mayor loses some badly needed support: Mayor Richard Riordan was bicycling 
on a dirt road in the Santa Monica Mountains over the weekend when a ledge gave 
way, sending him tumbling. The result: a broken collarbone and several broken 
ribs. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan was also sporting a swollen nose and bruised cheek when he spoke at 
the Pacific Design Center on Tuesday. "We're passing the hat around to buy me 
some training wheels for my bike," he quipped. 
</P>

 Some adults don't like homework, either: Jeremy P. Tarcher Inc., a book 
publisher, was one of several companies evicted from an Olympic Boulevard 
office building last week because it was found to be badly damaged by the Jan. 
17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's nine employees have been working at home -- and some of them 
don't like the change. "I like to separate my work from my personal life," 
explained receptionist Joyce Newill, taking company calls from her Koreatown 
apartment. "The thing I miss most is the social aspect of going to the office." 
</P>
<P>
 We have just the book for her: "Working From Home," published by Tarcher. 
miscelLAny Birds, a Hollywood restaurant, will be serving Hollywood's all-time 
cinebatic turkeys on its video monitor on Thanksgiving Day, including, of 
course, "Howard the Duck."

 "From the desert to the sea, to all of Southern California, a good evening. 
I'm Jerry Dunphy. Tonight, from Burbank, we introduce a special news magazine 
that will bring you up close and personal with today's newsmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps you remember my dialogue with former President Nixon a few years 
back. Decades before that, Edward R. Murrow went 'Person to Person' with 
Eleanor Roosevelt. In that same great tradition in recent times, Tritia Toyota 
has gone 'Face to Face' with Judge Lance Ito, Connie Chung went 'Eye to Eye' 
with Faye Resnick, and Kelly Lange went 'Cheek to Cheek' with Heidi Fleiss. 
</P>
<P>
 "So tonight we proudly introduce 'Hype to Hype!' because, to quote Judge Ito, 
'It's sweeps week.' Our first report comes from our ace investigative reporter. 
He's the award-winning journalist who broke the story about the time-logged 
KCBS videotape that inaccurately showed that prosecutor Marcia Clark had 
entered O.J. Simpson's estate before the judge approved the search warrant! 
Maybe Harvey Levin had it wrong, but he had it first! Harvey, I understand you 
have something in common with our first guest." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's right, Jerry. But first let me say it's an honor to work with you. 
America will never forget the Nixon-Dunphy summit. As you mentioned, Jerry, my 
first guest, like me, isn't just a TV personality. No, he's also an attorney at 
law. Just like me! Tonight, I'm going 'Hype to Hype!' with that brilliant 
barrister, Johnnie Cochran." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good to be here, Harvey." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Cochran. Don't think your smooth talk will work on me. Your partner on 
the Simpson defense team, Mr. Shapiro, said in open court that race would not 
be a factor in this trial. You, however, have complained that the prosecutors 
were trying to exclude black jurors. Today, the jury is predominantly African 
American. And now you are complaining that the D.A. wants to add a black deputy 
district attorney to the prosecution team." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's right." 
</P>
<P>
 "Correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Cochran, but is it not true that you yourself 
are African American?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't deny it." 
</P>
<P>
 "So my question, Mr. Cochran, isn't your criticism of the D.A. a little like 
the pot calling the kettle . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "African American? The answer is no. Absolutely not. Race has nothing to do 
with the defense of Mr. Simpson. It's the prosecution and the media who are 
trying to make race an issue. Not us. Goodness, we want to try this case on the 
evidence!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Cochran, just one more question. If you could be a tree . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "What kind of tree would I be? Hmmm . . . I think I'd be a rubber tree." 
</P>
<P>
 "Interesting. Why's that, Mr. Cochran?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, we have a saying in the courtroom: 'I'm rubber, and you're glue. 
Anything you say bounces off me, and sticks to you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Ah, yes. The words of Oliver Wendell Holmes. Thank you, Mr. Cochran . . . 
Jerry?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you , Harvey. A fascinating meeting of the minds. Our next report comes 
from sportscaster Jim Hill. Jim used to play pro football! He's the reporter 
the players trust!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you, Jerry. Keep the faith. And speaking of faith, I'm going 'Hype to 
Hype!' with a big man who has kept the faith of friendship. Yes, people who say 
that a dog is man's best friend have never met my old gridiron buddy, the one 
and only Al Cowlings!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Nice to see you, Jim." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good to see you, big guy! You know, you had us worried. The way you ran 
interference for the Juice, a lot of people thought the D.A. was going to throw 
the flag!" 
</P>
<P>
 "No comment." 
</P>
<P>
 "No problem! You don't want to say anything that could get you in trouble! But 
let's talk about your main man, the Juice! Tell us everything you know about 
that fateful night in Brentwood!" 
</P>
<P>
 "No comment." 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear ya, Al! What you're saying is that, sometimes, keeping the faith is 
about keeping silent. Hey, sometimes it's even about taking the Fifth! Am I 
right?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I have absolutely, 100% no comment." 
</P>
<P>
 "And you always gave 110% on the field! Thanks for joining us, my man!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Always glad to help a friend, Jim." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I'll keep that in mind! Keep the faith! Back to you, Jerry." 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you, Jim, for that heartwarming report. Unfortunately, we're running 
out of time, so tune in next week as John Tesh goes 'Hype to Hype' with Barney 
the Dinosaur, Mary Hart goes 'Hype to Hype' with Kimberly, the pink Power 
Ranger, and Rush Limbaugh goes 'Hype to Hype' with Rush Limbaugh. And now, 
we'll sign off with Todd Donaho's special 'Take-a-Hike.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Thanks, Jer. Tonight's Take-a-Hike goes to all those jealous cheap-shot 
artists out there who just love to rip people who make an honest living 
protecting the people's right to know. So Howard Rosenberg, this thumb's for 
you! Take-a-hike! "

UNIVERSITY WATCH; FREE-SPEECH BOUNDARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Should a white professor suffer a penalty -- dismissal from a department 
chairmanship, for example -- if he or she makes a politically incorrect comment 
about blacks? No, conservatives have tended to argue. Yes, liberals have often 
maintained, one person's mere political incorrectness being another's outright 
racism. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday the U.S. Supreme Court took, roughly, the liberal side, but it did 
so in a case in which the stereotypical roles were reversed. This time, it was 
a black, Leonard Jeffries, who had been stripped of his chairmanship because of 
politically incorrect (or racist) comments about whites, specifically about 
Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is not just Jeffries' right to express his views, which the court 
does not contest, but the right of the City College of New York to employ whom 
it chooses in pursuit of its legitimate ends. Both rights deserve defense. In 
returning the case to a lower court for retrial, the Supreme Court has not 
ruled on the merits of the university's claim against Jeffries but it has 
affirmed that this kind of claim does not in principle violate the First 
Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 The comments that cost Jeffries his black studies department chairmanship were 
truly racist and inimical to the purposes of a university. On the merits, 
Jeffries should lose. But the principle is larger than this application. 
</P>
<P>
 An employer may not simply fire an employee with whom it disagrees, but not 
all misbehavior can be protected as speech. There are crucial distinctions to 
be made; it remains to be seen whether in the resolution of this case they will 
be.

CALIFORNIA CASTLES UNDER SIEGE; HOMEOWNER INSURANCE IS HARDER TO GET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Any tax cut that California homeowners hope for from the reelected Gov. Pete 
Wilson must be balanced against the increase in home insurance premiums that 
many may face soon after Insurance Commissioner-elect Charles W. Quackenbush 
takes office. The insurance industry, the largest single contributor to the 
Wilson campaign, virtually financed the Quackenbush campaign, and big 
benefactors tend to receive kid-glove treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide public pressure on Wilson and Quackenbush could change that, but a 
looming insurance panic is creating pressure in the opposite direction. As 
Bradley Inman reported in The Times last Sunday, "All of the big companies have 
stopped writing homeowner policies and hordes of smaller ones are following 
their lead. Those remaining represent only 25% of the total need. . . . " In 
the week before the election and the week after it, the crisis has grown 
suddenly more acute. The unavailability of insurance is forcing many real 
estate sales to fall out of escrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners are a captive market: Their property cannot be moved. Home buyers 
and sellers are particularly vulnerable inasmuch as a sale typically involves a 
mortgage from a lender who demands an insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how much the Northridge earthquake has taught insurers that they did not 
already know about the risk of insuring California property is a complex 
question. Perhaps the risk is now considered so much greater that all the 
property insurers who say they are leaving California for good really mean it. 
It would be naive, however, not to ask whether the major insurers are not 
attempting, perhaps with the help of friends in state government, to stampede 
the nation's most lucrative insurance market into substantial rate increases 
that are unwarranted even in light of previously unrecognized risk. 
</P>
<P>
 More hangs on the resolution of the insurance crisis than whether family 
budgets are to be busted. Much, if not most, of California's wealth exists in 
the form of real estate, and if the value of the real estate takes a nose dive, 
so does the state's tax base and its revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the state need not negotiate with insurers from quite the same 
position of vulnerability that the individual homeowner suffers; also, insurers 
stoutly support some kinds of government involvement -- the federal Natural 
Disaster Protection Act, for example. Meanwhile, tough and honest regulation 
has to make the difference. That's what Californians have to hope for from 
Quackenbush and Wilson, despite the millions that the insurance industry spent 
getting the two elected. Let's give them a chance to show that they put the 
consumer first, while respecting the legitimate needs of insurance companies to 
run a profitable business.

QUIVERINGS IN A 'DEAD' SYSTEM; A PRIZE-WINNING SLOVAK NOVELIST WARNS OF 
RESURGENT COMMUNISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last Friday "The Year of the Frog," by a young Slovak novelist, Martin 
Simecka, was awarded The Times' Art Seidenbaum Award for first fiction. The 
work had been published serially and under- ground before the so-called Velvet 
Revolution toppled the communists from power in Czechoslovakia. After that 
revolution, it appeared in book form with a foreword by Vaclav Havel, free 
Czechoslovakia's first president and, since the breakup of the federation, 
president of the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Simecka told the Book Prize audience that the experience of being published in 
translation and winning an American literary award was "abnormal." Of course, 
many a modest winner has made an equivalent statement. Simecka went on, 
however: It was not just being published abroad that was an experience of the 
abnormal, it was being published at all for a real readership rather than just 
for "one's friends and the police." But there was no need to be alarmed, he 
said with the irony for which Czechs and Slovaks are famous: "Normality" would 
soon be restored. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly Simecka was alluding to Vladimir Meciar, the unrepentant Stalinist who 
since the alleged final defeat of communism has twice been elected prime 
minister of Slovakia. Just weeks ago, though he fell short of winning a third 
election, Meciar returned to effective power. Controlling a majority in the 
Slovak Parliament, he was able to undo, virtually overnight, crucial agreements 
that the outgoing government had made to foster the transition to a market 
economy. In a move surely of keen interest to any writer, Meciar put a 
hard-line crony in charge of internal security. Worst of all, perhaps, he has 
begun whipping up Slovak chauvinism against Hungary and ethnic Hungarians in 
Slovakia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cold War as a standoff of superpowers may be over, but communism is not 
dead. There are many who pine for its return, and soft- or hard-line communists 
now lead Poland and Lithuania as well as Slovakia. Simecka's mock resignation 
to the return of communist "normality" can and should be heard as a quiet 
warning.

THE DANGER OF A FUZZY CALCULUS; FED'S LATEST INTEREST RATE HIKE SEEMS TO BE 
BASED ON CRUDE BENCHMARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve Board's latest move -- a breathtaking increase of 
three-quarters of a percentage point in two key federal interest rate marks -- 
strikes us as a huge gamble. For this was the sixth and largest such increase 
of the year, and there still isn't any evidence of significant inflation in the 
recovering American economy. Does that mean the Fed's plan is working? Or that 
the Fed's plan is overwrought? 
</P>
<P>
 From the perspective of Southern California, a relapse into recession is 
feared far more than inflation amid a roaring recovery. The worry here is that, 
to quote Jerry Jasinowski of the National Assn. of Manufacturers, "The Fed is 
fundamentally misreading the economy. . . . While the economy grew faster than 
expected in the third quarter, there is not much evidence of inflation." 
</P>
<P>
 So why raise interest rates yet again, and by three-quarters of a point? For 
one thing, the Fed is looking at a national economic expansion and not just at 
California. Perhaps another important answer is that Fed officials actually may 
be less preoccupied with hedging the nation's bets against future inflation 
than shoring up the besieged U.S. dollar, which these days is getting precious 
little respect on world currency markets. Rising interest rates here tend to 
lure foreign money into American accounts. And that tends to improve the 
dollar's standing as a currency that is traded against other national 
currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the motive, the question remains: Is the Fed making the right move? 
Our sense is that the Fed's policy analyses are driven by tenuous calculations. 
They tend to be based on statistics about the economy that more resemble rough 
benchmarks than precise calibrations. They also depend on macroeconomic models 
that may or may not reflect the full reality of the complex American economy.  
</P>
<P>
 There are still a whole lot of people out of work, a whole lot of people 
trying to close escrow, a whole lot of companies trying to borrow money to get 
started or to expand.  
</P>
<P>
 The Fed may prove correct in concluding that higher interest rates are a good 
thing. But we are concerned about what they mean for California, and the 
decision overall is based on a lot of maybes.

HUFFINGTON CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Huffington and Others Say $30 Million Was Well Spent," Nov. 13: 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Bunting's analysis of the Mike Huffington campaign certainly points out 
the deterioration present in this most recent voting/campaigning process. When 
a politician, any politician -- Republican or Democrat -- can crassly expend 
his fortune to degrade the character of another in order to win, something is 
drastically wrong. And the speculation that $10 million more would have put 
Huffington on top definitely is a wake-up call for any voter who considers 
himself or herself an American. 
</P>
<P>
 This campaign was not about a Republican defeating a Democrat. Huffington 
didn't lose because Dianne Feinstein (supposedly) won. He lost because anyone 
defacing another to the tune of $30 million can't be allowed to win. As a 
Californian, Huffington left a shameful mark on our voting report card. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought there was something in this recent campaign that we should have 
learned in grammar school. Are we going to have to own up to the fact that we 
are teaching lies to our children? Or do we teach one set of values to them and 
live another set ourselves? What happened to good citizenship, decency and 
moral values?  
</P>
<P>
 Unsportsmanlike conduct in the face of defeat deserves 10 laps on any playing 
field. There is a lesson here for everyone to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 If Huffington needs an arena to dump his millions, I know of a lot of 
important projects that could use some help like: Bread and Roses Cafe, in 
Venice, that daily feeds the homeless; A Friendly Place, in Oakland, that 
assists women on the streets, and the Gathering Place, in Los Angeles, that 
supports those suffering from AIDS.

 * While watching the election returns I couldn't help but notice that 
Huffington's victory party was in Orange County. After reviewing the election 
return finals I figured out why -- Santa Barbara County was one of only two 
Southern California counties to go for Feinstein.

<P>
 * For those who hoped that the elections would have turned out differently, 
there is a bright ray of sunshine. The American people decided that it was time 
for a change of great magnitude. Yet, in their infinite wisdom the voters 
denied seats in the Senate to a convicted liar in Virginia and an "empty suit" 
in California who thought he was entitled to buy that seat. 
</P>
<P>
 The only shadow to those bright spots is that each received so many votes. I 
guess "you can fool some of the people some of the time."

<P>
 * I'm trying to figure out why Huffington picked California as the state whose 
House -- and then Senate -- seat he would buy. What was wrong with Texas? (If 
Santa Barbara Republicans are any measure of how people react after they've 
gotten to know him, it's no mystery.) 
</P>
<P>
 Still, why didn't Huffington pick a smaller state, such as Arizona or Hawaii, 
where he could have paid twice as much per voter and still saved millions of 
dollars -- is he that lousy a businessman? 
</P>
<P>
 After some reflection on this, I have come to the conclusion that people in 
smaller states would have seen through Huffington in a minute, no matter how 
much money he spent.

<P>
 * In the midst of a $$$ onslaught from a grizzillionaire opponent and a 
political tidal wave against her party, one candidate stood head and shoulders 
above all the others with class and dignity: Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 We will be served well with this real and remarkable Californian in the U.S. 
Senate.

overwhelming defeat of Prop. 186, the "single-payer" initiative, ought to send 
a message to the proponents of increased government in medicine. A whopping 73% 
of Californians rejected a government takeover of the health care industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Take note, Mrs. Clinton: Of all the major ballot measures in the nation this 
election, "No on single-payer" received a higher percentage of votes than any 
other legislation, including Prop. 187 and the assisted-suicide initiative in 
Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Single-payer is wrong on principle. The Declaration of Independence recognizes 
the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. This means your life, 
liberty and pursuit of happiness. You have no right to that of your neighbor. 
The Founding Fathers didn't recognize a "right" to health care. Your sickness 
is not a claim on the livelihood of a doctor. You have the right to work for 
your health care, earn it and pay for his services. 
</P>
<P>
 If the next health care task force is tempted to repackage single-payer, 
here's some truth in advertising: It means that hospitals will be operated, 
managed and financed by government. 
</P>
<P>
 Prop. 186's promise of a statist utopia rested on the notion that you're born 
with a right to someone else's actions. If you accept this idea, you accept 
socialized medicine. The solution lies in the way we purchase health care 
insurance. Currently, government encourages HMOs, resulting in a "choice" of 
only HMOs, which perpetuates a third-party payer system. Patients have grown 
accustomed to the idea that someone pays the bills.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead of being dependent on another generation or the state to give you or 
your company a health care handout, you should choose, manage and finance your 
own health care. We advocate phasing out Medicare in favor of tax-free medical 
savings accounts as a means of liberating patients from the bureaucracy of 
today's health care financing system. In other words, capitalism.

<P>
 I am writing in response to "Can We Stop Child Killing?" Voices, Nov. 7: 
</P>
<P>
 I agree that we need better prenatal care and better parenting preparation. I 
would like to see mandatory classes for all expectant parents.These classes 
should include prenatal, and parenting for mothers and fathers. Lamaze classes 
are offered to couples; why not offer parenting classes too? 
</P>
<P>
 We learn our basic parenting skills from our parents, family and experiences 
in our lives. Luckily, many of us have had good examples to follow but there 
are too many who have had bad experiences. By offering parenting classes, some 
young lives can be saved. BETTY WILLIAMS Los Angeles * 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, we can stop the child killing by giving custody to the father in a 
divorce. In L.A. County, 68% of children are killed by the mother or her 
boyfriend. It is in the best interest of the child to be placed with the father 
who wants custody. JOHN FLEISCHER Burbank

SOFTWARE PIRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Pirates of the Internet" (Nov. 3) contains the claim that software theft 
represents a $2.2 billion annual loss to the industry. This number is absurd, 
and represents a logical fallacy that has permeated the entertainment industry 
for years.Theater owners who catch people sneaking into a screening think 
they've lost the price of a ticket, record companies who catch someone making a 
cassette of a CD think they've lost the price of a prerecorded cassette, and 
now software publishers who catch people making unauthorized copies of software 
think they're losing the price of their software. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these merchants are laboring under the misconception that the 
perpetrators would have spent the full retail price of the goods if they hadn't 
gotten them for less. This is ridiculous. Kids who sneak into theaters do so 
because they can't afford a ticket, music lovers who make cheap copies of music 
do so because they can't afford CDs, and people who copy software do so because 
software is unaffordable. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no way on earth I would shell out $60 for LucasArts' "TIE Fighter" 
game, but if I could get it for free, sure I'd give it a try. Since I never 
would have bought it in the first place, my "pirated" copy of "TIE Fighter" 
would actually represent a net loss to LucasArts of $0.

IN DEFENSE OF A NOBLE CALLING; NOTARIES: NOT EVERYONE CAN MAKE THE GRADE. 
FIRST, YOU MUST MASTER YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GILBERT CRANBERG, Gilbert Cranberg, former editor of the Des Moines 
Register's editorial pages, is a notary public who teaches journalism at the 
University of Iowa. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pardon me if I boast a bit about being a newly anointed notary public. Yes, 
I've joined a select corps of about 40,000 Iowans whose notarial acts, in the 
words of an authority, "must be performed with integrity, diligence and skill." 
Or as Iowa Secretary of State Elaine Baxter wrote when she sent me my 
commission, ours is a public service "essential to the smooth operation of 
business, the judicial system and other important institutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, I wasn't thinking about any of that when Hugh Culverhouse set me on 
the path to notary publichood. Culverhouse, not a household name but not a 
nobody either, was a Florida philanthropist and owner of the spectacularly 
failed Tampa Bay Buccaneers professional football team when he died recently. 
In his obituary, the New York Times listed his claims to fame: 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Culverhouse was a tax lawyer, real-estate developer, business executive 
and notary public." 
</P>
<P>
 I figured that if an achiever like Culverhouse (his fortune was estimated at 
$360 million) could earn notoriety as a notary and still find time to be a 
tycoon, it was a craft to consider. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot easier said than done.  
</P>
<P>
 To become a notary in Iowa, you have to have been alive for at least 18 years 
and be able to fill in the blanks of an intricate six-question application. 
</P>
<P>
 The form tests the would-be notary's ability to print or type not only his or 
her full name but also the address, including ZIP code and county. 
</P>
<P>
 Next comes a multiple-choice question (check one): Are you a resident of Iowa? 
Or are you a resident of a state adjoining Iowa, and employed in Iowa? 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the applicant must sign his or her name and write a check for $30 
(good for three years of notarizing). 
</P>
<P>
 Successful applicants are sent impressive certificates sprinkled with 
"emoluments" and "legally appertainings" that authorize them to display their 
shingles. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, notaries have to be adept at the authentication arts. In an era of 
multiple-personality disorder, cross-dressing, sex-change surgery and bogus 
IDs, people aren't always who they appear to be. On the notary public rests the 
responsibility to verify a person's true identity and attest to it. So, if 
you're looking for unsung front-line fighters in the war against fraud and 
other crime in the suites, don't overlook your neighborhood notary. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, there would be a lot less misrepresentation and distrust in the 
world if notaries were utilized more often, not just when the law compels it. 
Take the manuscript for this article. Before I sent it to the editor, I had it 
notarized; this way, the editor could be confident that it was written by me 
and not by some impostor. 
</P>
<P>
 So here's to more employment and recognition for notaries public, surely among 
the least-appreciated professionals.  
</P>
<P>
 Allow me to illustrate, with a personal experience, the modest regard in which 
we're held. My wife is an accommodating sort, but when I instructed her 
recently to be sure to have included in my obituary the words, "He was a notary 
public," she glared, "I will not!" 
</P>
<P>
 It pains me to disclose marital discord, but I pray that editors will heed me 
and accord notaries the send-off we deserve.

COLUMN RIGHT/ JAMES P. PINKERTON: CLINTON AND THE TRUMAN STRATEGY; THIS IS A 
NON-STARTER; 1948'S COMEBACK KID HAD SOMETHING TO OFFER DEMOCRATIC DEFECTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES P. PINKERTON, James P. Pinkerton is a lecturer at the Graduate School 
of Political Management at George Washington University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The moth wings of the media are fluttering over the question of "whither 
Clinton?" Will he come back from Asia ready to compromise with the new 
Republican congressional leadership? Or will he give 'em hell? The new bible of 
the Clinton White House is David McCullough's "Truman," the 992-page biography 
that was a surprise best seller two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some Harry Truman/Bill Clinton similarities. Both are Baptists from 
the Southern middle of the country and both enjoyed comfortable congressional 
majorities in their first two years in office but lost them in the midterm 
elections. Chapter 14 of McCullough's book, detailing Truman's whistle-stop 
campaign of 1948, should provide any underdog Democrat with enough hope to get 
through the dark Gingrich night. Not only did Truman win his own bid for a 
second term, but he also carried with him Democratic majorities in both 
chambers of Congress. Some in the White House are telling Clinton that he can 
do it: Tee off against Bob Dole and prove himself to be the once and future 
Comeback Kid. But for all the high hopes, the Truman strategy will never fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not? Two reasons. First, unlike Truman half a century ago, this Democratic 
President is no longer riding the wave of the future. Second, well let's just 
put it this way -- Bill Clinton is no Harry Truman. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1940s, the New Deal was still new. More than a third of American 
workers were in labor unions. People saw the cradle-to-grave welfare state as 
Franklin D. Roosevelt's unfinished legacy. Was that Big Government? Sure it 
was. Most people wanted a government big enough to protect them from fascists 
and communists abroad and capitalists at home. In the 1946 midterms, the 
Republicans campaigned on a two-word slogan: "Had Enough?" They won a 
throw-the-bums-out reflex, not a policy mandate. (Thus their campaign was the 
opposite of the "1994 contract with America," with its hundreds of pages of 
specificity.)  
</P>
<P>
 The Republican plan worked well enough to elect everyone from Joe McCarthy to 
Richard Nixon, but once they got to Washington, the Republicans had no clue 
about what to do. As they foundered, Truman pounced, warning Americans that the 
Republicans wanted to take them back to the bad old days of Herbert Hoover. 
Truman engineered showdown after showdown with the opposition Republicans. Even 
if he lost on Capitol Hill, he knew that he was winning the war for public 
opinion. As Truman recalled: "I knew that the people of this country weren't 
ready to turn back the clock -- not if they were told the truth, they weren't." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton would also be better off, Truman-strategy-wise, if he had more 
personal credibility. Truman was 33 when the United States entered World War I 
-- well past draft age. He had bad eyes and was the sole support of his mother 
and sister -- two more excuses from military service. Yet he volunteered for 
the 2nd Missouri Field Artillery as an enlisted man. His first electoral 
victory came when his comrades-in-arms chose him as their lieutenant. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1947-48, when he was a punching bag for the congressional Republicans, 
Truman needed all his accumulated inner strength. He had seen combat against 
the Germans at Saint-Mihiel in 1918; what was the worst that Republican leader 
Sen. Robert Taft of Ohio could do? 
</P>
<P>
 Military experience is not a requirement for leadership, but it does instill 
perseverance. Lani Guinier, the Bosnians and middle-class taxpayers would all 
be better off today if Clinton had been more committed to his commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 So if not Truman II, what's ahead for Clinton? Clinton himself may have 
provided the answer: He'll be Eisenhower II. In his book "The Agenda: Inside 
the Clinton White House," Bob Woodward reports that Clinton was so fearful of 
another round of Carter-style inflation and high interest rates that he 
restrained his big-spending appetite. In 1993, he told his Cabinet: "We're all 
Eisenhower Republicans," adding acidly "We stand for lower deficits and free 
trade and the bond market. Isn't that great?" The big exceptions to Clinton's 
Ike-like restraint, the billion-dollar "stimulus" package and his 
trillion-dollar health plan, were both defeated when Congress was controlled by 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's left for Clinton? ABC's Sam Donaldson says he ought to "enjoy life" 
-- take more foreign trips. There's the beginning of a realistic Clinton 
strategy: See the world, fight the NRA when it seeks to legalize bazookas, 
defend abortion rights and hope like heck that Ross Perot will make it a 
three-way race again in '96.

COLUMN LEFT/ ALEXANDER COCKBURN: WHAT GOP 'MANDATE'? IT'S A MYTH; ONLY 20% OF 
THE ELECTORATE WENT REPUBLICAN; IT'S NONSENSE TO SAY OUTCOME IS NATIONAL WILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEXANDER COCKBURN, Alexander Cockburn writes for the Nation and other 
publications. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Somewhere between 6 o'clock on election night and the early hours of the 
following day, a myth got set in concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 I can be reasonably precise about the earlier time because I was driving south 
down Route 101 toward San Francisco, listening to the National Public Radio 
crew mull over election returns on "All Things Considered." They were pondering 
what one nervously described as a political paradox: In Virginia, Chuck Robb 
had beaten off a ferocious challenge by Ollie North by appealing to the 
traditional constituencies of the Democratic Party -- African Americans, 
blue-collar workers, women. 
</P>
<P>
 The NPR pundits raised the possibility that appeals to the old liberal 
constituencies might not have been so stupid. A few hours later, such talk had 
been banished from the airwaves and, not long thereafter, from the opinion 
columns as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The following propositions were taken to be self-evident: 
</P>
<P>
 * The nation had swung decisively to the right. As with the Reagan victory in 
1980, phrases like "seismic upheaval" and "generational shift" were much in 
vogue.  
</P>
<P>
 * President Clinton had sealed his party's fate by betraying the New Democrat 
pledges of 1992 and swerving to the left.  
</P>
<P>
 * The only recipe for Democratic salvation was for President and party to seek 
to recapture the "center," by being harder on crime, welfare recipients, poor 
people and other outcasts from the social contract.  
</P>
<P>
 All of this is the most outstanding nonsense. There was no more of a seismic 
shift than there was in 1980.  
</P>
<P>
 In terms of absolute numbers, the vote in House races split 50-50 between 
Democrats and Republicans.  
</P>
<P>
 With New Democrats trying to outflank their Republican opponents on crime, 
welfare bashing and ridiculing of "government," while ignoring the economic 
travails of traditionally liberal voters, many of those voters stayed home.  
</P>
<P>
 African Americans boycotted the polls at twice the average rate. Their 
turnout, at 38%, was down 12 points from 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 And the notion of Clinton running a leftist White House is ludicrous. The 
pundit elite may have brainwashed itself into believing that, but blue-collar 
workers saw a corpocrat who shoved NAFTA down their throats; African Americans 
heard two years' worth of calculated insults, stretching back to Clinton's 
premeditated affronts to Jesse Jackson and Sister Souljah, and 
environmentalists saw their causes suffer the worst two years of the past 
quarter-century. 
</P>
<P>
 With terms like centrist and moderate, political vocabulary has now been 
voided of all useful meaning, but the bottom line is that Clinton ran a White 
House servile to the priorities of Wall Street and big business.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the election was a stunning rebuff to the New Democrats. They lost 
their races at twice the rate of their more liberal Democratic colleagues. 
Their leaders -- Sen. Jim Sasser of Tennessee, Rep. Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma -- 
crashed to defeat.  
</P>
<P>
 But the clamor about the supposed conservative earthquake is serving exactly 
the same function as it did in 1980 and 1981: the creation of a collective mood 
among the elite opinion-formers that to oppose right-wing policies is to flout 
the clear mandate of the people.  
</P>
<P>
 Notwithstanding demagogues like Newt Gingrich, there was no such mandate. The 
Republicans won the support of about 20% of all Americans entitled to vote. 
More than 100 million citizens didn't vote at all.  
</P>
<P>
 As one might have predicted, the stampede strategy has already cowed a 
President whose political backbone, even at the best of times, has the 
consistency of marshmallow.  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has opened the door to school prayer. He has pledged ferocity on 
welfare. He'll probably support a balanced-budget amendment, a truly insane 
economic strategy that will ravage Medicaid, Medicare and ultimately Social 
Security, and stifle long-term economic recovery.  
</P>
<P>
 As a matter of desperate urgency, the left has to rally against the right and 
if necessary, against a sellout President loath to fight back with veto and 
filibuster.  
</P>
<P>
 As a first step, the left should proclaim that there is no right-wing mandate 
nationally, any more than there was a mandate for the immigrant-hating 
Proposition 187 in the Pajaro Valley farm town of Watsonville, near which I 
once lived. Watsonville voted yes on 187, but with the support of just 3,144 
out of an over-18 city population of 21,523. Is 14.6% of the potential vote a 
mandate for hate in one city, or 20% a true mandate in a nation?

PERSPECTIVE ON NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION; IRAN IS RIPE FOR A PEACEFUL OVERTURE; 
RATHER THAN WAIT FOR A CRISIS, AS WITH KOREA, THE U.S. SHOULD TRY NOW TO 
INFLUENCE TEHRAN'S SUSPICIOUS AMBITIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By GARY SICK, Gary Sick, a former National Security Council staff member for 
Iran, is executive director of the Gulf/2000 project at Columbia University.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The standoff and subsequent agreement between the United States and North 
Korea is a vivid reminder that procrastination is dangerous and expensive when 
dealing with would-be nuclear regimes. The world had suspected for a decade 
that the dictatorship of Kim IlSung was secretly developing the capacity to 
build a nuclear weapon. But only after the evidence became overwhelming, and 
the possession of such weapons a real threat, did the United States and others 
begin to develop a serious response. 
</P>
<P>
 The most prominent candidate for the next proliferation crisis is Iran. But, 
because Iran's nuclear program is still extremely small and U.S. leverage is at 
its peak, there is a good chance of averting a full-blown crisis -- if the U.S. 
government acts now, with the same determination that was shown in the talks 
with North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 When Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci sat down with the North 
Korean negotiator, he had only a few cards to play. North Korea probably 
already had the makings of one or more bombs, and its conventional military 
threat to South Korea made coercion an excessively risky and probably 
unworkable option. In the end, Gallucci got the best deal he could. Rather than 
quibble about the terms, we should profit from the experience so we have a 
better hand to play the next time. 
</P>
<P>
 Iran is actively seeking nuclear-related equipment from many sources. Iran has 
a small research reactor that it purchased from the United States more than 20 
years ago. Last year, Iran signed contracts with China and Russia for three 
nuclear power stations. Iran also attempted to acquire more dangerous research 
reactors from Argentina and China, but the United States intervened to squelch 
both deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Iran is a signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and a thorough 
inspection of its known nuclear facilities last April resulted in a clean bill 
of health by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Iran's government flatly 
denies the existence of any nuclear weapons program, claiming that its 
interests are purely peaceful and oriented toward nuclear power production. 
This does not ring true. Iran's reserves of natural gas are sufficient to meet 
its domestic power needs for centuries. President Hashemi Rafsanjani, in his 
periodic reviews of Iran's energy policies, has never referred to plans for 
domestic nuclear power generation. The world is right to treat Iran's behavior 
with suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
 But Iran is not North Korea. There is time to develop an effective strategy 
before Iran's nuclear program gets to the crisis stage. Exactly how much time 
is hard to say. Although the CIA estimates that Iran could have a nuclear 
weapon within eight to 10 years, the nuclear power reactors that Iran is 
purchasing from Russia and China will take at least eight years to build, and 
they will not produce any irradiated nuclear fuel until after about 10 years' 
operation, if ever. In fact, these light-water nuclear plants are roughly 
comparable to those being offered cost-free to North Korea in return for its 
agreement to give up its current graphite reactor technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, after the sobering experience with North Korea and Iraq, Iranian 
intentions are in themselves grounds for concern by regional and external 
powers alike. Even if Iran is ultimately unsuccessful in building a nuclear 
weapon, the mere act of trying could trigger fears and possible counteractions 
in the region. What can be done to deflect Iran from the nuclear path? 
</P>
<P>
 The real lesson of the North Korean case is that isolation of potential 
offenders, even when combined with a strict international ban on the sale of 
nuclear technology, is not sufficient to solve the ultimate problem. Real 
progress was achieved only after contact was established with the leadership in 
Pyongyang and Korean security concerns began to be addressed directly. 
</P>
<P>
 Contact with an estranged regime does not imply approval. It must be based on 
a cool assessment of U.S. interests and a calculation that those interests are 
better served by engagement than by a comfortable, but ostrich-like, 
detachment. 
</P>
<P>
 That judgment is particularly difficult in the case of Iran because of the 
bitter experience of the 1979-81 hostage crisis and the Iran-Contra affair, as 
well as Iran's hostility to the Arab-Israeli peace process and its suspected 
support of terrorist groups. However, the present U.S. policy of "containment" 
is not producing positive changes in Iran's behavior. Our policy is openly 
disregarded and privately mocked even by many of our friends in the region, as 
I learned in a meeting this summer with representatives of Persian Gulf states. 
Contrary to prevailing pop analysis and wishful thinking, our jawboning and 
obstruction of international development credits for Iran will neither 
transform nor bring down the Islamic revolutionary regime. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is the dominant power in the Gulf. It need not -- and should 
not -- make any unilateral concessions to Iran. Present efforts to ban sales of 
nuclear weapons technology to Iran should be stringently maintained. At the 
same time, the Clinton Administration should name a senior representative, such 
as Assistant Secretary of State Robert Pelletreau, to undertake discussions 
with Iran without preconditions. Pelletreau is a seasoned diplomat whose 
experience with the PLO while he was ambassador to Tunisia showed that he can 
be tough and discreet. 
</P>
<P>
 This approach would add a new seriousness of purpose to U.S. expressions of 
willingness to talk to Iran. Iran complains that its security concerns go 
unheeded by the West. The naming of a high-level interlocutor would challenge 
Iran to put those concerns on the table in an authoritative dialogue. The 
experience with North Korea demonstrates that direct engagement with a hostile 
and radical state can sometimes produce unexpected results.

TROJANS OPEN UNDER PARKER WITH A LOSS; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: USC CAN'T HOLD 
HALFTIME LEAD, LOSES, 97-84, IN PRESEASON NIT GAME AGAINST NEW MEXICO STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For nearly 12 minutes Wednesday night, the Charlie Parker-era for USC 
basketball was a prime-time act against New Mexico State, the two-time 
defending Big West champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last 28, however, the Trojans' inexperience and lack of transition 
defense proved to be the difference against the senior-led Aggies, who rallied 
for a 97-84 victory in the first round of the Preseason National Invitation 
Tournament before 2,128 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans played inspired basketball for Parker in his first game as interim 
coach since the retirement of George Raveling on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 USC was led by Lorenzo Orr with 23 points, including 17 in the second half. 
Brandon Martin had 17, and Cameron Murray and Burt Harris 12 each. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started out very well in pushing the ball and playing aggressive," Parker 
said. "Basketball is a game of spurts, and we didn't respond tonight. We came 
out laid back (in the second half) and let them do what they wanted to do. We 
just hit a wall and never really regained the level we started at. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the beginning of the game, our emotional level was a real positive. But 
that wears off and then you have to play basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, New Mexico State made 24 of 34 shots for 70.6%. The 
Trojans shot 38%. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney Walker led the Aggies with 25 points. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico State did not have a starter taller than 6 feet 7, and USC started 
basically a small lineup also with Harris (5-10) and Martin (6-4) at guards, 
Orr (6-7) and Jaha Wilson (6-5) at forwards. The difference for the Trojans was 
seven-foot center Kirk Hominick, who made his first start. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite four early turnovers, USC got off to a fast start thanks to an 
aggressive, gambling defense and cold shooting by the Aggies. The Trojans 
needed more than two minutes to score their first points under Parker before 
taking a 12-3 lead with 15:50 remaining in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans led, 19-9, at the 12:35 mark and USC's defense continued to give 
the Aggies problems as the Trojans opened up their biggest lead, 28-13, on a 
three-pointer by Murray. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico State responded to outscore USC, 25-11, over the next eight minutes 
behind the scoring of Walker, who finished with nine first-half points, to 
close within 39-38 with less than a minute remaining in the half. The Trojans 
then closed the half with two quick baskets off assists from Murray to take a 
43-38 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico State, which has won the Big West title the last two seasons and 
has made five consecutive trips to the NCAA tournament, came out fired up in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aggies jumped out early to take a 58-52 lead with 11:51 remaining as the 
Trojans' outside shooting went south. New Mexico State capitalized by getting 
its fast-break offense untracked behind Skip McCoy, who came off the bench to 
score five quick points. 
</P>
<P>
 USC was able to stay close on the dunking of Orr, who scored six of the 
Trojans' first nine points in the second half. New Mexico State's full-court 
trapping defense gave USC trouble getting its halfcourt offense set-up. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of some of USC's 26 turnovers, New Mexico State took a 69-62 
lead at the 8:52 mark mainly on layups and free throws. The Trojans' 
inexperience began to take a toll against the veteran Aggies, who started five 
seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 Trojan and NIT Notes 
</P>
<P>
 On the last day of the early signing period for high school seniors, USC 
received a commitment from Maurice Strong, a 6-foot-9 power forward from 
Tennessee. The Trojans already had a commitment from Damion Dawson, a 6-3 point 
guard from Long Beach Poly. . . . USC does not play again until Nov. 27 when it 
plays Temple in the first Martin Luther King Classic doubleheader in Memphis. 
Georgetown and Arkansas will meet in the other game. USC's next game at the 
Sports Arena will be Nov. 29 against Northern Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 In another Preseason NIT game, George Washington defeated Syracuse, 111-104, 
in overtime at Syracuse. The Colonials scored the first 12 points of the extra 
period after Syracuse had tied the score at the regulation buzzer on a banked 
three-pointer by Michael Lloyd. Kwame Evans had a career-high 29 points for 
George Washington, which led by nine with 2:01 left in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 In other first-round games, Canisius defeated Penn, 81-78, behind Michael 
Meeks' 36 points; Ohio topped Ohio State, 78-67; No. 14 Virginia edged Old 
Dominion, 83-80, and No. 18 Alabama rolled over Kansas State, 79-48. . . . For 
Virginia, Cory Alexander, sidelined last season after breaking an ankle in the 
opener, scored 29 points. For Alabama, Eric Washington had 23 points, with 15 
coming on three-pointers.

LAKERS CAN'T MEET KNICKS EVEN HALFWAY; PRO BASKETBALL: NEW YORK LEADS BY 17 AT 
THE HALF, HAS GAME WELL IN HAND BY THIRD QUARTER IN A 110-89 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The people started heading to the Forum exits Wednesday night with about seven 
minutes to go. That didn't make them an L.A. crowd, merely a smart one. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, they were only imitating the home team. The Lakers clocked out 
sometime in the third quarter, sticking around only in body to endure a 110-89 
thrashing by the New York Knicks before 13,630 in a game that included enough 
garbage time to keep three sanitation departments busy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our worst game of the year?" said Laker Cedric Ceballos, who had 19 points, 
12 rebounds and five steals. "I don't know. I guess it was shooting-wise. We 
worked hard, but nothing was falling. We couldn't put the ball in the hole." 
</P>
<P>
 Two games after making only 34.6% of their attempts from the field against 
Golden State, a season low, the Lakers shot 36.8% against the Knicks. They 
committed 18 turnovers, about four more than their NBA-low average coming in. 
They surrendered 22 points, eight rebounds and five blocks to Patrick Ewing and 
27 points to Hubert Davis, although 14 came in the fourth quarter when the game 
was all but over. And they went through another starting power forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played very poorly, obviously," Coach Del Harris said. "You have to give 
credit to the Knicks. They're a very good and very disciplined basketball team. 
They took us out of everything we wanted to do offensively. They're just as 
good if not better than last season." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers (3-5) look tattered. Their last three games have resulted in two 
blowout losses and a thank-God-it's-the-Clippers victory on Wednesday. They now 
have one day off to prepare for the Cleveland Cavaliers. Make that one day to 
recover. 
</P>
<P>
 Elden Campbell was the starting power forward de jour, not so much by default, 
although it might quickly come to that, but because Harris wanted to add some 
size against the powerful Knicks. Coming after George Lynch and Anthony Miller, 
he is the third different Laker in the opening lineup at that position in as 
many games. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell, who went from starting last season to averaging only 16.2 minutes 
his first five appearances, won the job, for the moment, with a strong fourth 
quarter against the Clippers. His reward in his first start of 1994-95 was to 
guard Ewing, after Harris switched the defensive assignments from the first 
meeting at Madison Square Garden and used the power forward on the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell had bigger problems than a superstar, though. He had trouble staying 
in the game, replaced after picking up his second foul only 5:39 in. Ewing 
proceeded to work the reinforcements for 17 points, five rebounds and four 
blocks in the first half as the Knicks, on the third stop of a four-game 
Western Conference swing, took a 53-36 lead at intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 Concluding the series against the defending Eastern Conference champions only 
eight games into the season, the Lakers fell apart late in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 They were down only 39-32 despite poor shooting, before the Knicks added to 
the cushion with a 14-4 run over the final 2:50 for the 17-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing had four of the points in the late rally, but John Starks did the most 
damage with seven points, including a three-point basket with 1.3 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 That turned out to be merely the beginning of the blowout. The Knicks went up 
by as many as 26 points in the third quarter, the first time at 73-47, and led 
heading into the fourth period, 82-59. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell, meanwhile, avoided additional foul problems and finished with 17 
points and seven rebounds in only 23 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 No Knick had more than eight rebounds, though New York still had a 51-44 
advantage in rebounding.

<P>
 Everything you always wanted to know about UCLA, USC, the series, and the game 
Saturday at the Rose Bowl: 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins can't go to a bowl this season, but can make it four in a row over 
the Trojans for the first time. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 USC leads the series, 34-22-7, and has outpointed UCLA, 1,236-983. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Tickets, priced at $30, are still available. In fact, an agency has placed 
newspaper advertisements this week not for Saturday's game, but the USC-Notre 
Dame game on Nov. 26 at the Coliseum. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 ABC will televise both USC-UCLA and Oregon- Oregon State at 12:30 p.m. on a 
regional basis. We'll get the Bruins and Trojans on Channel 7, but, presumably, 
also frequent updates from Corvallis. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 USC's turnover ratio of plus-1.4 per game is best in the Pacific 10 Conference 
and fifth in the nation. UCLA's ratio of minus-0.4 is ninth in the conference. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 After O.J. Simpson's 64-yard run during USC's 21-20 victory in 1967, Coach 
John McKay said, "A good back might have made the eight yards for a first down. 
O.J. made it to the Rose Bowl." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 To the winner goes the Victory Bell. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The bell, which used to hang from a Southern Pacific locomotive, was rung 
after every point scored by UCLA teams in 1939-40. Then it was stolen by USC 
students. It became a prize in 1942. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The kicking might be the finest at the Rose Bowl since the World Cup. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA punter Darren Schager is averaging 43.9 yards, which ranks eighth 
nationally and first in the conference. USC's John Stonehouse is second in the 
conference and 11th nationally with a 43.7 average. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Ellena and Bob Peterson, co-captains of the Bruins' unbeaten 1954 team 
that shared the mythical national championship with Ohio State, will be 
introduced to the crowd at the end of the first quarter. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Prothro and Ann Sanders, the widow of Red Sanders, will watch from the 
VIP area of the press box. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 UCLA long snapper Christian Andersen is the son of Foster Andersen, a former 
Bruin guard and assistant coach at UCLA and USC. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 USC has averaged 43 points during its last three games. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 After the Trojans' 52-0 win in 1931, the series was discontinued until 1936. 
In September that year, Times columnist Braven Dyer predicted the Bruins would 
tie the Trojans, 7-7, when the rivalry resumed. He was proven exactly right. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 UCLA is celebrating its 75th anniversary and Charles Young his 25th 
anniversary as chancellor. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Bruin alumni include Tom Bradley, the late Ralph Bunche, Francis Ford Coppola 
and John Williams. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 USC, which was founded in 1880, maintains one of the 27 comprehensive cancer 
centers in the nation. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Trojan alumni include Art Buchwald, Warren Christopher, George Lucas and the 
late John Wayne. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-nine Bruins made the Director's Honor Roll with grade point averages of 
3.0 or higher during the 1993-94 school year. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Twenty of USC's 26 seniors last season have graduated and five others are 
within a semester of earning their degrees. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Early arrivals will have a chance to attend the water polo game between the 
second-ranked Trojans and sixth-ranked Bruins at 10 a.m. at the Rose Bowl 
Aquatic Center. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Free shuttle bus service will begin at 8:30 a.m. from the parking lot at the 
Parsons Engineering Building at Fair Oaks and Walnut in Pasadena. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Terry Donahue is 2-0 against USC as a UCLA player, 1-3-1 as an assistant 
coach, and 8-9-1 as a head coach. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 John Robinson is 3-0 against UCLA as a USC assistant coach and 5-3 as a head 
coach. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA clinched its first Rose Bowl berth with a 14-7 victory in 1942. However, 
the great Bob Waterfield completed only two of six passes against the Trojans. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 USC wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson and UCLA tailback Sharmon Shah were 
roommates in 1992-93 when Johnson attended West L.A. Community College. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The highest-scoring game in the series was USC's 45-42 victory in 1990. The 
quarterback who threw the winning touchdown pass to Johnnie Morton with 16 
seconds left, Todd Marinovich, has resurfaced as a volunteer quarterback coach 
for Capistrano Valley High. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Prediction: USC 38, UCLA 28.

 Lindsay Davenport Wednesday ousted Anke Huber from the $3.5-million Virginia 
Slims Championships at Madison Square Garden in New York, 6-2, 6-2, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no disguising tactics: hit hard, harder and hardest. The only 
diversion was an occasional moon ball to allow the players to get back into 
position for another barrage of heavy ground strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 While seventh-seeded Davenport is the higher ranked of the two, and thus was 
seeded in this elite 16-player field, Huber has been one of the hottest players 
on the WTA Tour lately.

 NHL general managers, after meeting in Toronto, reaffirmed their intention of

</P>

 "He (union chief Bob Goodenow) hasn't given any of us any indication that he 
wants to say anything other than no," Edmonton GM Glen Sather said. "If you 
want to make compromise and get a deal, there are ways you can do it. I don't 
think he wants to do it. . . . I believe he's trying to push this thing right 
to the point where we can continue with the present deal. He thinks that we're 
all going to fall down. We can't. We're already down." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Gary Bettman will meet with Goodenow today in Boston to reject 
the limited entry-level salary concessions last offered by the union. Bettman 
said he has not set a deadline for canceling the season but said 50 games would 
be the minimum for a meaningful season. In that case, an agreement would have 
to exist by mid-December. Fourteen games have been erased from each club's 
schedule and more cancellations are imminent. A decision will be made early 
next month whether to cancel the All-Star Game, scheduled Jan. 21 at San Jose. 
If the game does take place, lineups might be chosen by players instead of by 
fan balloting. Miscellany

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: MIDGET CARS PROVE PERFECT FIT FOR COFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Cofer, the U.S. Auto Club's western regional midget driving champion, has 
no illusions of a career in Winston Cup, Indy cars or Formula One. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy where I am," he said when asked about his long-range ambitions. 
"Midgets go fast enough for me, and I enjoy the competition. Besides, I'm too 
busy to take a lot of time off to race somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 During the week, Cofer, 29, helps his father-in-law run a hay and cattle ranch 
near the Oregon border. He has to drive 285 miles from his home in Macdoel to 
Sacramento to catch a plane to compete. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 800 acres in alfalfa and about 5,000 acres of pasture land on both 
sides of the Oregon-California line," he said. "I grew up on a vineyard in 
Sonoma Valley -- a third generation rancher -- so I know about harvesting a 
crop, but learning to be a cowboy is new to me. I don't know which is harder, 
learning to ride a horse on the range or drive a race car." 
</P>
<P>
 With the championship already assured, Cofer has two more dates this season -- 
Saturday night at Ventura Raceway and Thanksgiving night in the 54th running of 
the 100-lap Turkey Night Midget Grand Prix at Bakersfield Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking forward to both of them because all the national drivers come out 
for the last couple of races, and I've had good success at both Ventura and 
Bakersfield," Cofer said. Of his five wins in 24 races, three were at Ventura 
and one at Bakersfield. The other was at Calistoga. He holds the track record 
at Ventura of 12.02 seconds for the one-fifth-mile dirt oval. 
</P>
<P>
 Cofer drives a 160 cubic-inch midget owned by Dwaine Esslinger of South El 
Monte. Jeff Wahl of Edmunds Autoresearch of Corona designed and maintains the 
chassis, and the Ford engine is prepared by Esslinger and his son Dan, a former 
off-road truck racer. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many drivers, Cofer was raised in a racing atmosphere. His uncle, John 
Batto, raced a double-A fuel dragster in the '60s, and his father, Glen, and 
grandfather, Herb Batto, were racing enthusiasts who took John to the races 
from an early age. 
</P>
<P>
 He made his midget debut in 1988 and won his first main event in 1990 at 
Granite City, Ill., when he and his grandfather, then 80, spent their summer 
driving from race to race in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Cofer's fortunes changed in the summer of 1993 when Wahl asked him to drive 
the Edmunds car for the Esslingers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew all about the car," Cofer said. "Hank Butcher had raced it and he had 
influenced me to drive midgets a few years earlier." 
</P>
<P>
 Cofer's first race with Esslinger was at Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "We drove all the way down, and it was rained out," he said. "It was a long 
way to go for a hamburger." 
</P>
<P>
 In last year's Turkey Night Grand Prix, Cofer finished third behind eight-time 
winner Ron Shuman and Robby Flock and ahead of such nationally known drivers as 
USAC champion Steve Reeves, Stan Fox, Sleepy Tripp, Jimmy Sills and Butcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite running little more than half a season in '93, Cofer finished fifth in 
USAC points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided we were going to run for the championship before the '94 season," 
Dwaine Esslinger said. "Johnny got off to a slow start when Tony Stewart won 
most of the early races, but once he got the lead in the eighth race, he never 
lost the lead." 
</P>

<P>
 Most athletes try to follow their coaches' directives. 
</P>
<P>
 The Master's College basketball player James Mosley was more focused on his 
father's advice when the Mustangs opened their season Wednesday night against 
Walla Walla. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad always told us to push ourselves," said the Mustang junior guard, 
whose father died last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's exactly what I'm going to do this year." 
</P>
<P>
 His father would have been proud. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosley scored 26 points as the host Mustangs walloped Walla Walla, 116-46, 
picking up where they left off last year in Bill Oates' first season as coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was over from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosley's three-pointer to open the scoring sent the Mustangs on their way to a 
12-0 lead. They increased the margin to 63-24 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Penberthy and Leo Gorauskas each added added 17 points for Master's.  
</P>
<P>
 Gorauskas, who scored all of his points in the first half, also had eight

Mustangs, who had a 28-5 record and reached the National Assn. of 
Intercollegiate Athletics national tournament for the first time in school 
history last season.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad I had the opportunity to play them."

OPERA REVIEW; MASSENET'S CHEAP PERFUME; S. F. EXHUMES 'HERODIADE' WITH 
SUPERSTAR DOMINGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Massenet's "Herodiade," which received its not-much-awaited San Francisco 
Opera premiere this season, was first performed in Brussels in 1881. Some 
romantic indulgences travel quicker than others. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone knows at least two of the hit tunes: the sweet, lovesick soprano's 
"Il est doux, il est bon" and the not-so-sweet lovesick baritone's "Vision 
fugitive." Few, however, know that the hum-along arias emanate from a prime 
example of that insufficiently neglected genre known as biblical bilge. 
</P>
<P>
 The soprano in question is Salome -- not the depraved sex kitten with iron 
lungs defined for eternity by Richard Strauss but a dedicated sacrificial 
saint. The baritone may sing his heart out to the sympathetic gallery, but he 
happens to be the ignoble Herode. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This, after all, is the sprawling opus in which the stentorian-pure hero is 
called Jean the Baptist. To justify all the silly business in San Francisco, he 
looks and sounds for all the world like Placido Domingo. 
</P>
<P>
 Did I say silly business? How kind. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be hard to take the mystical muddle of "Herodiade" seriously in the 
cool light of 1994 under any circumstance. But Lotfi Mansouri, general director 
of the San Francisco Opera, has compounded the problem by assigning himself to 
stage the proceedings and engaging the now all-too-omnipresent Gerard Howland 
as scenic designer. 
</P>
<P>
 Mansouri's production, a festival of hoary-cartoon cliches, leaves no tattered 
turn unstoned. The gestures are impure stock, and the configurations suggest an 
ancient concert in costumes. Howland's ugly designs, which must at least have 
economy in their favor, suggest a raid on the warehouse. Jerusalem, AD 30, 
evolves in a little literal glitz here, a little ersatz modernism there, and 
lots of stylistically contradictory projections in the blurry background. 
Gilding the phony lily, Mansouri added a riotous razzle-dazzle wardrobe created 
for the nice people of Nice (as in France) by Maria-Luise Walek. 
</P>
<P>
 The quaint result is part De Mille quasi-spectacular (Cecil B., not Agnes), 
part Folies-Bergere show, part Vegas biz, part Christmas-pageant ritual, part 
stellar improv and part grand-operatic museum. This is High Art -- note the 
capital letters, please -- replete with hootchy-kootch dancers in discreet 
spangles, a couple of bare-breasted extras providing contradictory color, 
communal eye-rolling in lieu of acting, clumsy spear-carriers strutting in 
excelsis, bargain-basement luxury, and, for bad measure, a decapitation episode 
that the tasteful composer had wisely consigned to the viewer's imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 All this and music too. 
</P>
<P>
 The music is redolent of cheap perfume. It is, of course, very good cheap 
perfume. 
</P>
<P>
 Massenet knew his public and his period. He knew how to mix religious and 
erotic ecstasies, how to fuse the formulas of bombast and the allures of mock 
exotica. He knew how to send the masses home humming. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a lot of padding here, to be sure. There is a lot of engaging, 
well-made pap too. For the susceptible, under the right conditions, "Herodiade" 
could be the stuff of guilty pleasure. But. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Valery Gergiev of the erstwhile Kirov Opera isn't exactly steeped in the 
gentle, sentimental Gallic tradition. The Muscovite maestro did little on 
Tuesday to reinforce the shimmering textures or to stress the subtle sensuality 
of the intimate passages. Nevertheless, he did manage to sustain an aura of 
dramatic urgency and expressive propulsion that often made sound more imposing 
than sight. One had to be grateful. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast was good, for the most part. Unfortunately, it wasn't good enough 
(and certainly not idiomatic enough) to validate the repertory exhumation. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean, the prophet with the heart of mush, isn't really the stellar challenge 
the Domingo fans had hoped for. The mellifluous Baptist does sing some very 
pretty love music near the beginning, however, and some very gutsy defiance 
music near the end. Our tireless and ever-authoritative hero rose to both 
challenges with a fine semblance of conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Renee Fleming, the great diva hope among young spinto sopranos, sounded a bit 
wan at the outset, and she had to do some dangerous pushing to make an impact 
in moments of climactic rapture. At her best, however, she sang with glowing 
tone and sensitive coloration that could easily justify her place in a lonely 
pantheon. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Pons looked burly and sounded woolly, also muffled, as he strolled 
through the crucial platitudes of Herode. Where, one had to wonder, are the 
splendorous baritones of yesteryear? Where are the successors to Maurel and 
Renaud, to Thomas and Tibbett, to Merrill and Warren, to Singher and Bacquier, 
to MacNeil and Milnes. . . ? 
</P>
<P>
 Although Herodiade is the titular protagonist, the semi-wicked queen hardly 
dominates the opera. That is a pity, because Dolora Zajick sang with bright, 
ringing, wide-ranging fervor that almost compensated for her helpless 
histrionics. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Cox intoned the clerical platitudes of Phanuel -- a generous challenge 
once championed by Edouard de Reszke! -- with monochromatic second-bass 
competence. Incidental intelligence: 
</P>
<P>
 * This production is being preserved on a composite recording, sort-of live, 
for a doubtlessly grateful posterity. A company spokesman came before the 
curtain to ask the audience to refrain from intrusive applause, and the 
audience complied -- sometimes above and beyond the call. 
</P>
<P>
 * Celebrating the 25th anniversary of his local debut, Domingo was awarded the 
San Francisco Opera Medal in an onstage ceremony after the final curtain. 
</P>

 * The management has finally admitted that not all its singers are created 
equal. When John Keyes takes over as Jean the Baptist at the last two 
performances, ticket prices in all categories will drop $10.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'STAR TREK': WE'VE GONE THIS WAY BEFORE; 'GENERATIONS' RELIES 
HEAVILY ON AUDIENCE APPRECIATION OF THE FIRST TWO TV SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC

<TEXT>
<P>
 Going boldly where no one has gone before is not what it used to be. 
Contentedly settled into a prosperous middle age, the "Star Trek" series now 
seems more comfortable retracing its own footsteps, carefully offering its 
horde of fans interludes that aspire to do no more than fit snugly into the 
patterns of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, seeing "Star Trek: Generations," the seventh and latest Trekker 
theatrical feature, feels more like engaging in some kind of recurring 
religious ritual than taking part in the conventional moviegoing experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again we are back on the deck of the Starship Enterprise, a notoriously 
unstable place where losing one's footing is an occupational hazard and life 
lessons are not hard to come by. "You better take a look at this," someone is 
likely to say, and within moments terms like "drive plasma," "temporal flux" 
and "low-level ionic pulse" are being tossed around as if they actually meant 
something. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not only are the actors soothingly familiar from their previous television 
appearances, but -- except for cinematographer John Alonzo -- all the key 
creative personnel (from director David Carson to writers Ronald D. Moore & 
Brannon Braga to the producer, production designer, editor, makeup artist, 
costume designer, hair stylist and composer) also cut their teeth on the small 
screen versions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generations" seems even more familiar than most because its plot involves two 
separate starship lineages. Together again for the first time are James T. Kirk 
(William Shatner), the original series' 23rd-Century captain, and, fresh from 
its successor, "Star Trek: The Next Generation," 24th-Century Capt. Jean-Luc 
Picard (Patrick Stewart). 
</P>
<P>
 Yet a third captain, a wimpy sort named Harriman (Alan Ruck), starts things 
off in a prologue where he welcomes now-retired old-timers Kirk, Scotty (James 
Doohan) and Chekov (Walter Koenig) back as celebrity guests on the first 
Starship Enterprise in 30 years not to have the Big K in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 This premiere voyage for the new ship is supposed to be a quiet one, but, 
wouldn't you know it, a distress call is picked up from a transport ship caught 
in a mysterious ribbon of energy. When the dithery Harriman starts to fret and 
whine, Kirk, noticeably paunchy but still patriarchal, hits him hard but fair 
with a vintage Trek homily: "Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in 
that chair." 
</P>
<P>
 That pesky ribbon of energy also comes to engage the "Next Generation" folks, 
whose antics occupy most of the movie. Aside from Picard, the big screen 
welcomes both Lt. Cmdr. Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton), he of the all-seeing 
visor, and the android Data (Brent Spiner), an artificial life form whose lack 
of joie de vivre makes him the New Age counterpart of Spock. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the main subplot of "Generations" concerns what transpires when Data, 
tired of never getting the joke, inserts an emotion chip into his cranium and 
discovers humor, sadness and all the other feelings that humans are prey to. 
</P>
<P>
 The main story, when it finally reveals itself after a considerable amount of 
dithering, concerns the machinations of the villainous Dr. Soran (Malcolm 
McDowell), a 300-year-old El Aurian who likes to say things such as: "Time is 
the fire in which we burn" -- and will do whatever it takes to get back to that 
ribbon of energy. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor turns out to be so devious that one Enterprise captain is not 
enough to deal with him. Both Kirk and Picard are mobilized for the task, and 
it won't surprise anyone familiar with his Royal Shakespeare Company background 
that the commanding Stewart makes Shatner look like a graduate of the Klingon 
Academy of Dramatic Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, fans of the series will no doubt be happy to see Kirk again under any 
circumstances, and if you hunger for the "Star Trek" experience, this will keep 
you nicely occupied. As for moviegoers not washed in the blood, either a video 
trip back in time or a look forward to the next installment will be necessary 
to figure out what the fuss is about. For when someone in "Generations" says, 
"Somehow I doubt that this will be the last ship to carry the name Enterprise," 
you can take it to the bank. Literally. 
</P>

THEATER REVIEWS; DESPITE FLAWS, 'BABES' IS BOOMING WITH CHARM; MIXING IN 
RODGERS AND HART SONGS FROM VARIOUS SHOWS IS HIT AND MISS; OTHERWISE, THE 
IRVINE VALLEY COLLEGE PRODUCTION WORKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Wisely, the program for Irvine Valley College's Forum Theatre production of 
the 1937 "Babes in Arms" carries the disclaimer "based on the original by 
Rodgers and Hart." 
</P>
<P>
 Director Ron Ellison has staged a sort of hybrid "Babes in Arms," primarily by 
interspersing Rodgers and Hart songs that came from other shows, which don't 
always match the slots they're shoe-horned into. 
</P>
<P>
 One obvious squeeze is "The Lady Is a Tramp," whose lyrics are way too 
sophisticated for the teen-age girl who sings them. Some fit, such as "Mountain 
Greenery," from the team's first show, 1925's "Garrick Gaieties." 
</P>
<P>
 It's nice to hear these old standards, though one wonders why Ellison chose 
the show if he didn't like the original as it was. He could have just done a 
revue of Rodgers and Hart standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Accepting this patch job, you wonder why Ellison, who has kept the show set in 
1937, has inserted anachronistic name-dropping in lyric and dialogue: Frank 
Sinatra didn't become a star until four years later, and Gregory Peck, among 
others mentioned, came to prominence in the late '40s. George Oppenheimer, who 
wrote the book for this show, must be spinning in his urn. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly, Ellison has left intact Hart's repeated mention of "the Roxy Music 
Hall." You might have expected him to change that one, were he aware that 
within a few years it was renamed Radio City Music Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Even accepting all of that , and notwithstanding a few really badly shaped 
performances, Ellison has staged a pretty charming valentine to two of the top 
tunesmiths of the first half of the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 The story, later Hollywoodized into 
Mickey-and-Judy-find-a-barn-and-put-on-a-show, is delightful, and the Surf and 
Sand Summer Playhouse apprentices and their aching wish to get their own revue 
onstage retain their freshness. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Helwig is excellent as Val, the apprentice songwriter, and Leesa Dilalio 
a charmer as his girlfriend, whose older brother Steve (Tom Hafner) is a 
boy-wonder Broadway producer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Helwig's light tenor voice is just right, and Dilalio has a marvelous flair 
for tunes of the time. Susan Crouse's brass-edged voice as Bunny, the veteran 
apprentice, also is especially suited to the material and re-creates the tone 
of the period exceptionally well. 
</P>
<P>
 Roxanne D'ascenzo as the teen-age Hollywood star engaged to Hafner's Broadway 
wonder is very good at maintaining just the right edge of professional hauteur, 
and she warbles with just the right effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Hafner, an Equity guest artist, does well with his brief specialty material, 
but his smooth, calculated performance seems out of place amid all the youthful 
abandon on stage. In the supporting cast, Bart McHenry stands out in providing 
comic relief as Gus, also on the nose for the period musical this is. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Several actors, however, go way beyond reasonable limits of normality, for 
even 1937 musicals attempted to keep their characters real: Terry Christopher, 
as the summer theater's scroungy boss; Jeanette Barnes, only a sight gag as his 
shrewish wife; Paul Burt, as the Southern playwright whose bad play is 
currently on the summer boards, and L. Gionna Gordon as the Hollywood tot's 
stage mother. These four haven't been watching the believable apprentices to 
see how their reality makes the material sparkle. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the musical numbers, choreographed in period fun by Tracy Halas, under 
Ellison's sprightly musical direction, are a delight, in particular the 
re-creation of the original stage setting of "Johnny One-Note."

 David Who?: Jimmy Smits' first outing as the new man on the force in "NYPD 
Blue" paid off for ABC. The gritty police drama was the highest-rated network 
show Tuesday, edging out the CBS miniseries "Scarlett" and NBC's "Dateline," 
according to national Nielsen ratings. "NYPD Blue," which aired at 10 p.m., 
wound up with a 28 share, meaning that an estimated 28% of the television sets 
in use were tuned in to see how Smits fared in replacing star David Caruso, who 
left the show. The two-hour second part of "Scarlett," which premiered Sunday, 
started with a 23 share but rose to a 27 share in the hour against "NYPD Blue." 
"Dateline" at 10 p.m. received a 20 share.

preparing to take on television. The Conservative Television Network, a cable 
station set to debut by March or April of 1996, will target conservative 
viewers who believe existing networks operate with a liberal bias, its creators 
announced this week. Billed as a "mini-pay" station for which subscribers will 
have to ante up about $4 a month, network plans call for an in-house news 
operation as well as entertainment programs. . . . Elsewhere in the cable 
universe, Discovery Network plans to launch four new channels next year. The

 Stepping Up: Figure this one. French director Jean-Jacques Annaud replacing 
blockbuster filmmaker Paul Verhoeven on the $65-million on-again, off-again 
"Mistress of the Seas" for Columbia Pictures? That's right. Annaud is the same 
French director who brought you those beautiful, but financially unsuccessful 
films, "The Lover," "The Bear" and "The Name of the Rose." Now, however, he 
will helm "Mistress," the Jon Peters production picked up from Carolco Pictures 
because of a soaring budget. Word at Columbia is that Annaud was tapped because 
Verhoeven, the creator of "Total Recall," was just too pricey. Annaud is the 
filmmaker behind the 3-D IMAX film "Wings of Courage" for Sony Classics.

CLUB REVIEW; PRINCE'S MIGHTY GLAM SLAM LOSING SOME OF THE GLAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEIDI SIEGMUND

<TEXT>
<P>
 Perhaps it's a sign 'o' the times, but the once radiant Glam Slam has lost its 
luster. The decadent downtown dance club opened by Prince at the beginning of 
1993 has quickly come to resemble Sodom -- after the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the million-dollar renovation the club underwent when it was transformed 
from Vertigo to Glam Slam, only a couple of notable features remain -- the 
powerful sound system and the opulent columns. The two pillars of groping nudes 
flanking the dance floor and the giant Egyptian goddesses on each side of the 
stage are all that's left of Prince's erotic-city vision. 
</P>
<P>
 The walls are in disrepair, the bathrooms are unkempt, and the club operates 
with a skeleton crew. If this were the funky Al's Bar or any number of seedy 
punk or rock clubs, none of this would be unusual. But because it's Glam Slam, 
the home of performances by Prince himself as well as nearly every popular R&B 
and hip-hop artist, the attitude permeating the club is more depressing than 
exhilarating. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, not even a rock star can get around the main issue: Clubgoers want 
their Hollywood-style nightclubs in Hollywood. 
</P>

 Saxophonist John Handy could have retired on the strength of his play for 
Charles Mingus' 1959 recording of "Better Git It in Your Soul" and still 
assured himself a place in jazz history. His rousing, joyful solo for Mingus' 
revival-hall-styled anthem was smooth and exciting, technically sophisticated 
yet without the stuffiness that sometimes cramps musicians of exceptional 
ability. 
</P>
<P>
 The same can be said of his delivery Tuesday at Catalina Bar & Grill some 35 
years later. Despite the fact that he was working with a hastily assembled trio 
of backup musicians, Handy showed that he has not only retained the chops that 
earned him a spot on Mingus' landmark session but has expanded his tonal 
vocabulary to include bright, singing high notes, gravelly trombone-like 
mid-range tones and a rich reverberating low end. 
</P>
<P>
 Handy was scheduled to open this six-day run fronting his octet that includes 
string-vocal trio Class. But, as he announced from the stage to a tiny 
audience, one of the key members of the string trio underwent emergency 
surgery, and Handy decided to go it alone. 
</P>
<P>
 All the better. The quartet setting highlighted his play and he responded 
impressively, albeit on an uninspired set of well-worn tunes. His alto 
improvisations on "What Is This Thing Called Love" pulled and twisted at the 
famous melody, while stretching its harmonic content with offbeat, dissonant 
phrases and sprint-quick circular figures. On tenor, he emphasized the blues in 
"Blue Monk," then got warm and cozy with "Body and Soul." 
</P>
<P>
 While the ensemble play was loose and filled with missteps, the group began to 
mesh as the set progressed. Pianist Larry Nash was especially soulful during 
"Blue Monk," backed by bassist James Leary's gut-bucket strums. Drummer Quentin 
Dennard's tough exchanges with Handy during "A Night in Tunisia" fired the 
saxophonist to progressively higher peaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Vocalist Diane Witherspoon came out of the audience to perform "I Thought 
About You" and "What a Difference a Day Makes" in tones that recalled Dinah 
Washington. Each day will make a difference to the Handy quartet as the four 
men become more familiar with each other. 
</P>

AGGRESSIVE INDUSTRIAL SHRIEK FROM REUNITED KILLING JOKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The reunited Killing Joke didn't come to reminisce at the Palace on Tuesday, 
even if Jaz Coleman did close the night with the lyrics: "I'm living in the 
'80s!" There's a bit more irony in those words now, in this unfortunate era of 
'80s nostalgia, too soon, too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 This tour and the new "Pandemonium" album reunite most of the Killing Joke's 
founding lineup for the first time since 1982 (though Coleman kept the name 
alive as a vehicle for himself up through 1990), and could easily have been 
just another irrelevant blast from the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet while resurrecting the art-thrash-disco roar of its past on Tuesday, the 
London-born band maintained its relevance through the intensity of its 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Guitarist Geordie and bassist Youth re-created Killing Joke's signature buzz 
and howl through churning psychedelic chords and sheer volume, joining the grim 
Coleman to make a whole that is more Angst -ridden than later pretenders like 
the Rollins Band. That relentless industrial shriek has acted as likely 
inspiration to such newer acts as Ministry and Nine Inch Nails. 
</P>
<P>
 Killing Joke offered a challenging dance floor soundtrack for the Palace 
crowd, without being a slave to the beat. There was sporadic moshing and crowd 
surfing near the foot of the stage, but the music was often simply too murky to 
inspire dancing, and too aggressive to ignore. STEVE APPLEFORD

THEATER REVIEW; 'RAOUL': CULT CLASSIC FILM BECOMES A MUSICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 1982 film "Eating Raoul" was a low-budget satire that grew into a cult 
hit. While the rest of America was swept up in the Reagan revolution, the 
disaffected took to the film's Swiftian vision of a society where one must eat 
others or be eaten. 
</P>
<P>
 Now "Eating Raoul" is back, this time as a musical at Odyssey Theatre Ensemble 
in West Los Angeles. Mere satire might not be enough for today's disaffected 
masses, as last week's stunning electoral upsets suggest. But that's OK, 
because the players in "Eating Raoul: The Musical" don't have much time for 
politics or cultural criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 They're too busy dancing -- most memorably in skintight leather garb and 
fishnet stockings. And singing -- mostly cabaret tunes that summon memories of 
"Little Shop of Horrors." 
</P>
<P>
 Filmmaker-turned-librettist Paul Bartel, along with composer Jed Feuer and 
lyricist Boyd Graham, have turned Bartel's movie into an over-the-top tuner 
that manages to make cannibalism look cute and cuddly. It's a lot of good clean 
dirty fun, even if the original point gets lost amid jokes about cross-dressing 
and other perversions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sweeney Todd" this ain't. 
</P>
<P>
 Bartel's featherweight book concerns Paul and Mary Bland (Tom McCleister and 
Hope Levy), an aptly named Los Angeles couple working hard to buy a small 
restaurant far from the city. "We'll carry a mortgage instead of Mace," they 
happily predict in one number. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the dream is in peril. Paul gets fired and has his car stolen. Mary fends 
off a lecherous bank officer who denies the restaurant loan. Desperate, the two 
turn to a life of crime, advertising kinky sex services and then killing and 
robbing the perverts who answer the ads. This soon leads them into partnership 
with Raoul (Rick Negron), a janitor far more practiced in crime and betrayal. 
</P>
<P>
 Both book and songs are little more than hat racks for choreographer Adam 
Shankman's flamboyant production numbers. Don't bother listening for trenchant 
rhymes or dialogue here. The only sizzle comes in routines like "Hot Monkey 
Love," an homage to Marlene Dietrich's famous "Hot Voodoo." 
</P>
<P>
 If "Eating Raoul" loses its bite before the final curtain, it's partly because 
some cast members -- notably McCleister -- seem a little distracted. Paul is 
supposed to be bland, yes, but not catatonic. Worse, director Scott Wittman has 
permitted far too many technical goofs, even for a small stage. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Eating Raoul: The Musical," Odyssey Theatre Ensemble, 2055 S. Sepulveda 
Blvd., West Los Angeles. Wednesdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends 
Dec. 18. $18.50-$22.50. (310) 477-2055. Running time: 2 hours, 15 minutes.

ART REVIEWS; IT'S HOT AND STEAMY IN PHYLLIS GREEN'S 'TURKISH BATH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KANDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The inspiration for "The Turkish Bath," Phyllis Green's show at Jan Baum 
Gallery, is J.A.D. Ingres' painting of the same name, one of art history's most 
notorious odes to Orientalism. The hot-house atmosphere Ingres incarnates -- 
all damp flesh, intertwined limbs and Near Eastern froufrou -- becomes, in 
Green's hands, both hyperbolic and irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
 Green distills things into sculptural essences. Exoticism -- a pendulous form 
covered in black mesh and leopard skin, with a hookah pipe for a tail -- 
reclines on a bed of brocade, like a world-weary odalisque. Post-coital bliss 
is a speckled ceramic vessel with pale green velvet cords dangling limply from 
its many protuberances. Animal magnetism is a fetching creature who resembles 
the Queen of Anteaters -- with a white leather horn, a gold cord wrapped around 
her neck S&M-style, and an obscenely pointed pink tail. Forbidden pleasure is a 
two-pronged object adorned with demure white leather buckles, like a pair of 
Siamese twin Lolitas. 
</P>
<P>
 To call these little sculptures eccentric is an understatement. Indeed, 
Green's objects are so odd they verge on self-parody. To this end, they are 
ostentatiously placed on overstuffed fur pillows, which are themselves placed 
on silk-swathed pedestals. This is, however, less a commentary on those 
accouterments that deem an object "art" than a sly demonstration of a trick of 
the trade: When it comes to seduction, presentation is everything. 
</P>
<P>
 The work superficially resembles Lauren Lesko's opulent fetish objects. Yet 
where Lesko stresses a feminist psychoanalytic reading, Green refuses to get 
stressed-out. It's hard to work up to a hard-sell when you are yourself lost to 
sensual abandon. Indeed, Green so revels in her baroque sight gags and lavish 
materials -- ostrich feathers, neo-Victorian fringe, Ultrasuede, velvet polka 
dots, gold netting -- that critique is quite beside the point. This is not to 
say that her sculpture is dilettantish. It is as perverse and as concentrated 
as good perfume.

 Rust Never Sleeps: California assemblage art can be thought of as a 
long-playing ode to rust. Rust is a romantic metaphor for the passing of time. 
It insinuates the poetry of use and the beauty of waste. It has lost a bit of 
its frisson due to overexposure over the years. But George Herms, whose 
"Project X" is now on view at Kohn Turner Gallery, demonstrates that certain 
materials, like certain aesthetics, never die; they merely await reincarnation. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a surfeit of rusty things -- gas cans, silverware, car parts, mattress 
springs, muffin tins, tools and so on -- as well as old pieces of newspaper and 
discarded pieces of clothing that, by proximity, look rusty, too. These 
post-industrial discards are amalgamated into sculptural assemblages, and 
arranged in, on and above grid-like shelves -- one of Herms' favorite modes of 
display, borrowed from surrealism. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the most interesting of these assemblages are those that owe the 
greatest debt to surrealism and its attraction to peculiar juxtapositions. 
Among them is a piece titled "Appolinaire," which enshrines a chipped coffee 
cup from a restaurant named after the famous poet and a huge tangle of wire 
suspended from the ceiling like a tumbleweed floating out of a dream, studded 
with a scythe and a piece of melting glass. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the deadbeat allure of individual pieces, the show works best as a 
whole -- as a kind of studio-cum-mindscape. What ties it all together is Herms' 
longtime signature -- the word "LOVE," stamped in capital letters with a 
backward E. "LOVE" shows up in corners, on the undersides of objects, on 
dangling pieces of yellowed paper. This word is a perfect talisman for a man 
who has never allowed his wit to compromise his generosity of spirit, and a 
perfect gift for those viewers willing to pick through the refuse to find it.

 Jokester: In Michael Coughlan's new work at TRI Gallery, profound truths 
masquerade as dumb jokes -- maybe so successfully that when they unveil 
themselves, these truths feel like an intrusion, or a party-pooper's pieties. 
</P>
<P>
 Dumb jokes are fun, and it is hard not to have fun in the presence of a large, 
papier-mache mountain with glistening soap bubbles spewing from the top and 
popping delicately on their way down to earth. Equally crowd-pleasing is a 
plywood shelf, empty except for three lonely rubber worms, and a few nylon rope 
cobwebs in the corners. 
</P>
<P>
 Coughlan, however, wants to offer more than a series of quirky visuals. He 
wants to paint a wry portrait of the artist as callow youth. "Self-Portrait as 
a Small Volcano" thus is about the problem of being full of ideas whose 
transparency is evident to everyone else except you. "Still Life for the Fecund 
Ascetic" is about being cursed with a head so empty that everybody and 
everything -- except the proverbial worms -- have taken a hike. 
</P>
<P>
 There is something winning about the capacity to operate on multiple levels. 
Like that of Dennis Oppenheim, Rebecca Horn and Jack Pierson (an idiosyncratic 
trio, yet all come to mind here), Coughlan's work is both playful and 
conceptually dense. Yet there is a flip side Coughlan must consider as he goes 
for it all. And that is the fact that it is more difficult than it looks to wed 
whimsical form to serious (if self-deprecating) content. This work is very 
promising (the titles alone are quite wonderful), but it still feels 
semi-detached, as if one or the other -- form or content -- would do just as 
nicely as both. 
</P>
<P>

 Land Ahoy: At Margo Leavin Gallery, "In the Field" is a museum-quality survey 
of landscape in recent photography. One of its most notable accomplishments is 
its avoidance of the usual opposition between nature and culture. Here, the 
notion of landscape includes not only the expected verdant glens, rolling hills 
and stormy clouds, but also those interventions and desecrations afforded by 
the human presence. 
</P>
<P>
 In this, the show pivots on Sharon Lockhart's two photographs of teen-agers 
positioned against ocean backdrops. Her merciless inspection of their blemished 
faces assigns topographical significance to expanses of skin; at the same 
moment, the quivering waves seem to minutely calibrate their volatile, inner 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockhart is interested in the passage from the ordinary to the extraordinary. 
Probably the most compelling images in the show track the passage from the 
"natural" to the "unnatural." Robert Yarber shoots trees that are all but 
masked by the nervously flickering light. Andrea Robbins and Max Becher 
document the windmills and farmhouses of Holland, Mich., the neon-orange 
reflections on the water undermining the absurdly homey architecture. Collier 
Schorr depicts a partially clad boy straddling a tree, the milky white of the 
image an index of the boy's tarnished innocence -- or perhaps his precocious 
will-to-vacuity. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the show sweeps across nations, decades and aesthetics, making all 
sorts of unexpected connections. Bas Jan Ader's High Romantic trumpery finds a 
strange bedfellow in Jack Pierson's romance with the down-and-out, and Stephen 
Prina's conceptualism suddenly looks as ornate as Maria Nordman's spiritual 
urbanism. All shows can't be everything to everyone. This one does its best -- 
and its triumph is that it manages not to look superficial in the process.

MUSIC REVIEWS; TETZLAFF, ANDSNES PLAY RECITAL AT PAVILION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what continues to signal a fascinating if disturbing trend, two more young 
musicians of impressive talent related to music of this century with an 
intuitive empathy that was lacking when they tackled earlier standard 
repertory. 
</P>
<P>
 Violinist Christian Tetzlaff and pianist Leif Ove Andsnes, appearing as part 
of the Philharmonic Celebrity Recital series on Tuesday in the Dorothy Chandler 
Pavilion, found Debussy and Nielsen especially congenial, even if both 
composers were represented by works that date from before 1920. 
</P>
<P>
 The recital duo even dazzled in the last two movements of Ravel's Sonata, 
completed about two years before the great stock market crash of 1929, as their 
encores. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mozart in their hands emerged as a superficial chase, and the light and 
dark romantic charms of Schubert transpired within a severely limited compass. 
</P>
<P>
 Nielsen's Sonata No. 2, the least familiar piece on the program, however, 
blossomed. In three movements, the work progresses from withdrawn pastoral 
reflections interrupted by agitated outbursts, through declamatory struggles 
finally tamed, to a re-entry into the social contract, via a waltz tune. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the piece ends in surprisingly nervous disquiet. 
</P>
<P>
 Both musicians made sense of all the ways and byways. 
</P>
<P>
 Tetzlaff combined lyricism with golden if lean tone, and ranged in dynamic 
from breathlessness to muscular exclamation. Andsnes played with a seamlessly 
even and deft touch at all dynamic levels and literally across the board.  
</P>
<P>
 Debussy's Sonata No. 3 also found them recreative and reactive to the music, 
finding opportunities to explore color and dynamics and provide structural 
cohesion. 
</P>
<P>
 In earlier music, however, Andsnes tended to spin out phrases with little 
internal inflection, change in color or shift in character. He was a reticent 
partner in Schubert's Rondo in B minor (Rondo Brillant), D. 895, where 
Tetzlaff, as usual, was the warmer if self-circumscribed player. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, Mozart's Sonata in E-flat, K. 380, which opened the recital, emerged as 
a porcelain exercise in velocity, alleviated by an andante that insufficiently 
breathed. CHRIS PASLES

MUSIC REVIEWS; MUSIC NOW PLAYS CONTEMPORARY PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Based in Sacramento and energized by a sense of purpose, the gifted ensemble 
known simply as Music Now has a challenging mandate built into its name. 
Whether or not the 5-year-old group truly lived up to that promise Monday at 
the L.A. County Museum of Art, its concert suffered no lack of intrigue, 
commitment or even a sense of history -- relatively speaking. 
</P>
<P>
 From the historical department came George Crumb's mystical "Vox Balaenae" 
(Voice of the Whale). Dating from 1971, Crumb's piece takes its inspiration 
from the then-popular sound of humpback whale song and the prospect of 
extra-human communication. Extended techniques and a mystical spectrum of 
sounds are key ingredients, here neatly realized between cellist Robin 
Bonnell's harmonics, pianist Brenda Tom's percussive, inside-the-instrument 
scrambling and flutist Mathew Krejci's vocalizing. 
</P>
<P>
 Proto-minimalist Terry Riley's 1981 piece "Sunrise of the Planetary Dream 
Collector" is no more sober or rational than the title, with its twisting, 
phasing parts for string quartet and echoes of jazz and Indian classical 
traditions.  
</P>
<P>
 Music Now's founder and music director Howard Hersh offered two Los Angeles 
premieres of his own compositions, disparate in scale and focus but connected 
by a tendency to merge diverse ideas. "A Crown of Feathers," written as a solo 
vehicle for the ensemble's violinist William Barbini, weaves together mournful 
meditations, agitated double-stopping and Yiddish tunes, in a not-entirely 
seamless way. 
</P>
<P>
 Hersh's "Shrapnel in the Heart," which took up this Monday Evening Concert's 
second half, is a wartime reflection that unevenly blends concert and 
documentary material. The limpid plaints of soprano Anna Carol Dudley and the 
atmospheric, Morton Feldmanesque instrumental passages prove more effective 
than the chaotic collage of letters to Vietnam soldiers that spilled out of 
speakers placed around the hall. JOSEF WOODARD

MECHANIC DISPUTES HIS FIRING BY CULVER CITY OVER HARASSMENT CLAIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY MOORE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The former chief mechanic of the Culver City Fire Department, who was fired 
from his job in July following allegations of sexual harassment and bigotry, 
has appealed to the city's Civil Service Commission to be reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Lewis, 51, contends that he was terminated unjustly, and his appeal is 
being considered in ongoing hearings -- made public at Lewis' request -- that 
began in October and are scheduled through the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis' attorney, Phil Tangalakis, has set out to prove that Lewis was fired 
because he revealed alleged improprieties in a city maintenance contract. Lewis 
has alleged that Culver City overpaid for the maintenance of city police 
vehicles by sending them to a repair shop owned by a friend of the city's chief 
administrative officer, Jody Hall-Esser, and her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall-Esser said she and her husband are good friends with Bob Fox, owner of 
Performance Unlimited, and that he was the best man at their wedding. But 
Hall-Esser, who is scheduled to testify before the commission later this month, 
said their relationship had nothing to do with the firing of Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never involved myself inappropriately in this process, but I have 
lived up to my responsibility to make sure that the process was being carried 
out," Hall-Esser said. "I believe that this is happening at least in part or 
totally because there is no other defense (for Lewis)." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis was fired after Eva Lopez, a cadet in the Culver City Fire Department, 
charged that Lewis made derogatory racial and sexual comments in her presence. 
She filed a complaint with the city in May and a lawsuit in Santa Monica 
Superior Court in August. 
</P>
<P>
 In her suit, Lopez alleges that in addition to making derogatory statements 
about Mexicans, Lewis repeatedly discussed his sexual encounters and sexual 
fantasies with her. The suit also charged that Lewis falsely told another Fire 
Department employee that he had had sex with Lopez.  
</P>
<P>
 But witnesses called before the Civil Service Commission on behalf of Lewis 
told a different story. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was never discriminatory," said Jerry Mosley, who worked in the Culver 
City Fire Department and now is with the Long Beach Fire Department. "He was 
very fair, very honest. He was a good role model." 
</P>
<P>
 The city and Michael Olson, who was Culver City fire chief at the time, are 
also named in the suit. Lopez is seeking compensation for emotional distress 
and an order from the court mandating that Culver City increase its employees' 
sensitivity training in issues of sex and national origin. 
</P>
<P>
 Tangalakis said he believes Hall-Esser had a vendetta against Lewis, who had 
revealed that the city was in some cases paying twice as much as it should for 
police car repairs and parts. Performance Unlimited eventually lost the 
maintenance account. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Leb, Lopez's attorney, called that case irrelevant and said the 
commission's decision should be based solely on the alleged incidents against 
Lopez.

 Ending a five-year stalemate, a church group has tentatively agreed to sell 
its historic Pacific Palisades conference grounds to the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy for use as parkland, a conservancy official said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph T. Edmiston, the conservancy's executive director, said the agency has 
agreed to pay $4 million to acquire the 140-acre Presbyterian Conference Center 
from the Presbyterian Synod of Southern California and Hawaii by the end of 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is extremely significant, and we're elated that it's finally happening," 
said Edmiston, adding that "minor details" were to be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the synod, which represents about 300 churches, had no 
comment on the sale agreement. She referred questions to Rafael Aragon, the 
synod's executive director, who was unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
 A source familiar with the negotiations, however, said that church officials 
decided to sell the property at Sunset Boulevard and Temescal Canyon Road 
rather than proceed with a costly lawsuit to try to force the state to build a 
roadway onto parkland next door to its property. 
</P>
<P>
 The church group has long contended that the state is obligated to build the 
road, considered vital to the synod's long-stated intention to develop its 
property. During the 1980s, the synod had expressed interest in building a new 
meeting and lodging facility to hold 1,000 people. Faced with community 
opposition, it had scaled back its plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists have long coveted the rugged property -- bordered by 
parkland on three sides -- as the last remaining link in the effort to connect 
Temescal Gateway Park with Topanga State Park and the extensive Santa Monica 
Mountains trail system beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference center began in the 1920s as a place where Methodists held 
summer religious gatherings. The Presbyterians, who bought the property in 
1943, have used it as a retreat center and church youth camp. 
</P>
<P>
 To buy the property, the conservancy will use Proposition A funds administered 
by Los Angeles County, including $3 million earmarked for an outdoor camp 
program for at-risk youths. County supervisors approved the use of the funds 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The church group filed its lawsuit against the state and the Los Angeles 
Unified School District in 1989. The district had acquired the property from 
the synod by condemnation in 1968 to build a school, but sold it to the 
conservancy in 1992 after plans for the school were scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
 The synod contends that it was assured by the school district that the road 
would be built on the property and that the synod could share it. The synod 
insisted that the conservancy inherited the obligation to build the road as a 
condition of its purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to sell the property comes as the synod faces a Nov. 30 deadline 
imposed by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge to either proceed with the 
lawsuit or have it dismissed.

MARINA SILT REMOVAL FAR SHORT OF GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An effort by the Army Corps of Engineers to remove 135,000 cubic yards of 
contaminated silt and sand from the entrance to Marina del Rey is seriously off 
schedule, and engineers now expect to fall far short of their goal, a county 
official said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, it's going very, very slowly," said James A. Fawcett, chief of 
planning for the county Department of Beaches and Harbors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Corps in October was given permission by the California Coastal Commission 
to dredge at the mouth of the marina, encase the spoil in special plastic tubes 
and dump it in Los Angeles Harbor as part of a port expansion project. 
</P>
<P>
 Round-the-clock dredging began on Nov. 9, but officials said that with less 
than two weeks before a Port Authority-imposed deadline to complete the work, 
only about 10% of the material has been removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the delay was the result of unfamiliarity in using the special 
plastic containers, each capable of holding up to 1,000 tons of material. Until 
now, the containers had never been approved for such a project in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The coastal panel approved the plan to dig up the sand and silt and transport 
it by barge to the Port of Los Angeles after county officials warned that 
unless something is done, silting at the mouth of the marina could choke off 
boating. 
</P>
<P>
 The county, which administers Marina del Rey, had sought approval to remove 
530,000 cubic yards of the material. 
</P>
<P>
 Fawcett said that, judging from the slow pace of the project, it now may be 
possible to remove only half of the 135,000 cubic yards of material that was 
authorized. 
</P>
<P>
 In places, sand, silt and dirt lie barely beneath the waves, making it tricky 
for pleasure boaters to negotiate the marina's two entrances. Since August, 40% 
of the marina's north and south entrances have been closed to boating. The 
Corps has confined its work to one entrance at a time so as not to interrupt 
boaters' access to the marina, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 If only 70,000 cubic yards of the material is removed immediately, officials 
said, it will still greatly improve navigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't be able to get to minus 20 feet this round, as we would have liked, 
but if we're able to get (the sediment level) down to minus 10 or 12 (feet), 
that will be a great improvement," Fawcett said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sediment is largely the result of runoff from nearby Ballona Creek, which 
drains a 126-square-mile area from Downtown Los Angeles to the Pacific Ocean, 
picking up contaminants along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 The silting problem is not new for the marina, where the Corps has had to 
dredge frequently to keep the entrances open since the giant pleasure boat 
harbor was built in the 1960s. But it has become more severe in recent years as 
federal regulations -- which once allowed lightly contaminated materials to be 
dumped on beaches for separation and removal -- have become more stringent. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials acknowledge that the dredging operation is only a stopgap 
measure and say it could prove to be nearly futile if winter rains swell 
Ballona Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists have opposed the project, expressing concern that dredging 
will cause damaging materials to spread at the mouth of the marina. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coastal Commission rejected the plan in September, but in October approved 
a scaled-down dredging plan after securing assurances that the Corps will 
develop long-term solutions to keep the channel clear.

TOPICS / THEATER; VAUDEVILLE VETERANS BACK IN THE FOOTLIGHTS

 Most of the performers in the Vintage Variety Theatre began collecting Social 
Security many, many years ago, but age has hardly slowed them down. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "In September, I celebrated my 89th year in show business," says Estelle 
Milmar, who was five weeks old when her acrobat parents dressed her as a clown 
for their act. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Milmar will sing "Won't You Come Home, Bill Bailey?" joining other 
company members for a onetime performance of the variety-musical "Minstrel 
Days" at the Hollywood Palms Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Vintage Variety was formed this year to offer a venue to former stage and 
movie actors -- and entertainment to audiences ranging from hospital patients 
to the general public. The group grew out of ongoing theater performances 
staged over the years by Vintage Variety's founder and producer, Vi Lawson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We play tambourines, hop around, sing and dance," says Lawson of Sunday's 
production. "I wrote a little dialogue. And the music is early Americana: 
Stephen Foster, (George) Gershwin." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson staged the group's maiden production, "Seaside Terrace Cafe," last 
month at the hotel. On Dec. 18, the Vintage Variety Theatre returns with a 
Christmas show. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson, a Colorado native, trained as a ballet dancer and later segued into 
musical comedy. In the 1960s, she began performing in Los Angeles-area 
hospitals with fellow entertainers. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, she has helped provide entertainment for groups including 
Grand People, a Downtown Los Angeles service program for seniors, and has 
produced shows at the now-defunct Variety Arts Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Vintage Variety Theatre's Sunday production includes two actors in their 20s, 
but the majority of the 14 performers are seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 Pianist Al DeCrescent doesn't like to give his age, but admits, "I go back a 
while." During World War II, DeCrescent spent three years touring with Rudy 
Vallee and the Coast Guard Band. After the war, he put in two years as Jimmy 
Durante's pianist, then another two with Pinky Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've played with every star you can imagine: Roy Rogers, Frank Sinatra, 
George Jessel, George Burns," he says proudly. "I don't have favorites. There 
were all good." As for himself, the pianist allows, "I play better than I did 
25 years ago -- because I'm experienced. And I practice every day." 
</P>
<P>
 At age 54, Ron Davis is the lone middle-aged company member. After studying 
theater at the University of Nevada at Reno, he arrived in Los Angeles and 
performed stand-up comedy at such venues as the Improv and the Comedy Store. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Milt Larsen started the Variety Arts Center, I worked for him, hosting 
(and) emceeing, and I'd scout clubs for people to put in our shows," says 
Davis, who also performs every week with friends at an AIDS hospice. "That's 
how I met Vi, and I had her come to work as my choreographer." 
</P>
<P>
 In this show, Davis will sing "Camptown Races." He is also scheduled to sing 
"Frankie and Johnny Were Lovers" with Milmar, one of many company members with 
long and colorful careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Milmar started out traveling the country with her acrobat parents, playing a 
new town almost every week. Settling in Los Angeles in 1930, she performed up 
and down the coast -- in nightclubs and on TV and radio -- and then got into 
producing and writing variety shows. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, she keeps limber by square-dancing several nights a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's Harriet Hassler, 86, who describes herself as "one of those tough 
old broads." She began dancing as a 12-year-old in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "My kid brother and I would go to a dance hall and dance till midnight," she 
recalls. "My mother was Cherokee and French, very liberal-minded." 
</P>
<P>
 After showman Bob Alton put her on stage as a chorus girl and renamed her 
Charleston Crowder, Hassler danced with Frolics, the Ziegfeld Follies and with 
such stars-to-be as Betty Grable, Ginger Rogers and Virginia Mayo. 
</P>
<P>
 In this show, Hassler says, "I dance, do different things. I'm a 
jack-of-all-trades. I'm very lucky -- God gave me a lot of talent. And my whole 
life has been show business." 
</P>
<P>
 "Minstrel Days" will be performed at 2:30 p.m. Sunday at Hollywood Palms 
Hotel, 2005 Highland Ave. in Hollywood. Tickets are $7.50. For reservations: 
(213) 466-9955.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; MENTAL HEALTH CENTER TO BE REBUILT, ENLARGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Monica West Mental Health Center, severely damaged in the Northridge 
earthquake, will be rebuilt to double its original size with $5.2 million in 
government funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 13,250-square-foot facility was uninhabitable after the temblor, 
forcing the bulk of mental health professionals to work in trailers in the 
center's parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency is providing 45% of the reconstruction 
funds and County Supervisor Ed Edelman secured $1 million in county 
discretionary funds for the project. The balance will be paid over 20 years 
through the county's capital funding program. 
</P>
<P>
 A symbolic groundbreaking ceremony for the project was held Monday at the 
center's 1525 Euclid St. location. Construction is expected to begin in July, 
1996, and be completed in 1997. The center will open at an interim location, at 
1752 Cloverfield Blvd. in Santa Monica, in July of next year.

COMMUNITY NEWS: BEVERLY HILLS; POLICE ROLL OUT NEW PEDAL PATROL IN TIME FOR 
HOLIDAYS

<P>
 Gearing up law enforcement for the holiday shopping season, the police 
department has rolled out a new bicycle patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Riding black mountain bikes adorned with police decals, three specially 
trained officers on Tuesday pedaled off for their first day of two-wheeled 
policing, patrolling the boutique-lined streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bikes give officers greater mobility to patrol crowded streets and alleys 
than . . . squad cars or motorcycles," said police spokesman Lt. Frank Salcido. 
"While the officers can't catch fleeing vehicles, they will be able to get 
through traffic more quickly than a car, and will be used as any other unit in 
dealing with serious crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides patrolling the downtown area, the five-member bicycle unit will also 
police parks and parking garages. According to police, the bikes are less 
conspicuous than a car and may help prevent car burglaries and thefts. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, launched on a part-time basis, is expected to continue after the 
holiday season. Police officials say they hope it proves as successful with 
tourists and merchants as the department's 6-year-old "foot-beat program," in 
which an officer walks the business and shopping district. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills is the latest Westside city to start a bicycle patrol. Santa 
Monica and West Hollywood use similar downtown patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 "Small-town law enforcement agencies are discovering the bike patrol programs 
are more valuable then anyone had anticipated," Salcido said. He added that the 
129-member department has long been interested in using bike patrols, but only 
recently could devote the five officers needed for the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say they have hit the ground pedaling. All five Beverly Hills officers, 
they boast, placed in the top six spots at the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department bicycle officer training course. 
</P>
<P>
 Said the program's supervisor, Capt. Robert Curtis: "The only one to beat them 
was an officer who had been a cyclist in the 1988 Olympic Games." SUSAN

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; 'RESIDENTS' OF EMPTY LOTS ALLOWED TO VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former tenants of an apartment building that crumpled during the earthquake 
and was later demolished were allowed to vote last week as residents of what is 
now a vacant lot. 
</P>
<P>
 So were former residents of the Sea Castle apartments, a quake-damaged and 
subsequently condemned beachfront building.  
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners whose abodes were either condemned or demolished had the same 
privilege -- no matter where they currently hang their hats. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the severity of the Northridge earthquake -- and the state of 
uncertainty in which many residents still find themselves -- the Los Angeles 
County Registrar-Recorder's Office decided that all voters could cast ballots 
where they lived at the time of the temblor -- even though the dwellings may 
not still be standing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just don't go around depriving people of their right to vote," said 
Wendell Patterson, division chief of voter records for the county 
registrar-recorder's office. "If a person is temporarily displaced and has the 
intention of returning to their domicile, we will never cancel their 
registration." 
</P>
<P>
 During the campaign, recently reelected City Councilman Robert T. Holbrook 
unsuccessfully challenged the policy, saying people should be required to vote 
at their new addresses. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a building is taken down or condemned and it is no longer habitable, 
residents no longer live there," Holbrook said. "Why not let Beverly Hills 
residents vote here, too?" 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson said an exception to the post-disaster policy would be made only if 
a city informed him that dwelling units were out of commission for good. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica officials declined to count any of the city's condemned buildings 
as permanently lost residential property, said City Clerk Clarice Dykhouse. The 
city policy applied to buildings that are slated to be restored. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica City Atty. Marsha Jones Moutrie said it cannot be assumed someone 
is no longer a resident of a city because he or she doesn't live there right 
now. "We have local laws preserving the right of tenants to return," Moutrie 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moutrie said she had not specifically considered the vacant lot off San 
Vicente Boulevard where, apparently, no efforts have been made to rebuild the 
apartment house that once stood there. One of the owners, Hella Fletcher, said 
the vacant lot is for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson said voting rolls are periodically checked to see if mailing 
addresses jibe with the address at which voters are registered. If the 
addresses don't match, voters are sent a letter asking them to re-register if 
they've moved. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is possible to determine how many people voted from a specific 
address, Patterson said the county registrar-recorder's office is too busy 
tallying uncounted absentee votes to research the question right now. 
</P>
<P>
 Giving one anecdotal example, however, precinct worker Frank Schengel said 10 
out of 60 registered voters who lived at the condemned Champagne Towers on 
Ocean Avenue cast ballots last Tuesday. The future use of that high-rise has 
yet to be determined. NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN

INDEPENDENCE VS. TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SHIBUYA BROWN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Independent or dependent? Typists or assistant attorneys? 
</P>
<P>
 While many independent paralegals have learned their trade from experience -- 
either by working for attorneys or as employees in "typing services" that 
prepare legal documents -- many dependent paralegals opt for educational 
training from schools and colleges that offer certificate programs in paralegal 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 And therein lies a tale of two apparent professions united under a single name 
and, say some, complicated by the problematic matter of hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of traditional paralegals have not liked us," said Lois Isenberg, 
president of the California Assn. of Independent Paralegals, who said 
independents are often looked down upon by their certified brethren. "A lot of 
them feel we're stepping out of our domain. (They) don't want us to be called 
paralegals." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, said Richard Shaffron, who directs the Assistant Attorney Training 
Program at UCLA Extension, which turns out 250 graduates a year and is one of 
the nation's largest paralegal certificate programs. While it's true that most 
of their paralegals graduate into jobs working for attorneys, some who receive 
their certificates prefer to work independently.

 "I don't see any schism between the two (fields)," said Shaffron, a former 
entertainment attorney. "There's a huge, huge range of skills." 
</P>
<P>
 At UCLA Extension, the five-month, $3,500 course is designed to acquaint 
students with a disciplines ranging from entertainment and environmental law to 
public advocacy and personal injury law. While Isenberg said most of what 
certified paralegals learn is more theory than form preparation, Shaffron said 
the 22-year-old program has tried to emphasize both. 
</P>
<P>
 "We give our students both theory and practice," said Shaffron. "Many 
independent paralegals have certificates." SCOTT SHIBUYA BROWN

OUT AND ABOUT / RENAISSANCE SUPPER CLUB: DINING AND DANCING MAKE FOR A BOOGIE 
NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Nightclubs don't usually have the best reputation for adventures in dining. 
But Philip Cummins, owner of the supper club Renaissance, has found a way to 
mix his passion for good food and dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrons can start out an evening of dining and dancing with a meal prepared 
under the direction of chef Jose Noel, formerly of Tatou, who has put together 
a menu combining the tastes of Provence and Asia. Appetizers range from $5 to 
$9. Entrees include a grilled vegetable plate for $10 and a terrific lamb shank 
for $15. The dessert tray is also not to be missed. 
</P>
<P>
 After a meal, diners can burn off the calories on the dance floor, which is 
the club's heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Every Tuesday night, the Boogie Knights hit the stage to perform a meltdown of 
disco tunes from the 1970s. On all other nights, deejays spin the tunes. The 
music ranges from the latest hits to hip-hop and retro. 
</P>
<P>
 The club "has good music and a good crowd," said Derek Malmsten, 27, of Los 
Angeles. "I come here usually with a group of people and dance." 
</P>
<P>
 Cummins, a graduate of Claremont-McKenna College, said he has always been a 
night owl. Although the former investment banker began his career doing mergers 
and acquisitions, he always felt that his best energy came after midnight. 
While juggling a banking career, he opened the Crane Club in New York City in 
1986 with his brother. They went on to open Spy Club in Washington, D.C., and 
the Merc in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Cummins gave up his banking career so he could manage the clubs full 
time. The Ohio native, who has lived in Los Angeles since 1982, decided to try 
his luck on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to compete with Hollywood," said the 30-year-old entrepreneur. 
"I thought there was the demand on the Westside because there were no upscale, 
attractive clubs." 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-year search, Renaissance opened in 1993. Located near Wilshire 
Boulevard on the Third Street Promenade, the 10,000-square-foot club has 
26-foot ceilings, large windows and a dramatic fountain in the middle of the 
dining area. There are two bars and a VIP room that has its own elevator and 
entrance. It also serves as something of an art gallery, displaying various 
pieces from the Robert Berman Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a great idea to have a restaurant and club together," said 
Marina del Rey resident Audra Chavira, who was at the club Saturday night to 
help celebrate a friend's birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Renaissance, 1313 Wilshire Blvd., Santa Monica. Open Tuesday through Sunday, 
6:30 p.m. to 2 a.m. Admission is $10. Reservations for dinner are suggested. 
Information: (310) 587-0766.

REGIONAL REPORT: SAN FERNANDO; BOXING PROGRAM ROLLS WITH THE PUNCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rudy Campa, 52, dances lightly side-to-side in the shadows, dressed in sweat 
shirt, dark pants and white sneakers. His partner is Ernie Rodriguez, 16, a 
former member of the Sanfers, a gang based in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 Campa, a reformed drug addict, convict and gang member himself, weaves and 
bobs, then comes at Rodriguez, his hands -- enveloped by worn leather mitts -- 
held before him. Rodriguez, wearing a pair of boxing gloves, does not back off. 
He connects with a combination of swift punches to Campa's mitts. 
</P>
<P>
 Their figures -- that of an older, wiry man and a younger, lithe pupil -- cast 
weird shadows beneath the light bulb on the wall behind the headquarters for 
the youth organization called Salud on Celis Street.  
</P>
<P>
 They are connecting. And that is the point of it all. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of San Fernando in September banned Campa's group of about 50 youth 
boxers -- both male and female -- from the corner of the tennis court in Las 
Palmas Park, where the group trained, saying the group stirred up trouble and 
caused fights there. It was after their exile, the youths say, that the police 
began harassing them. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the teens, who are mostly Latino, thought about quitting the program, 
which provided them access to a positive, active peer group, and considered 
going back to whatever it was they did before -- hang out at the mall, cruise, 
try to find beer, avoid homework. Avoid home. 
</P>
<P>
 But two months later, the group is still together, better organized, larger, 
and, its leaders say, wiser after its run-ins with the city and with the 
police. And the group has a new name: the Las Palmas Youth Group -- chosen to 
remind members of their struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxing continues on a reduced level, with teens training on their own and 
shadow-boxing with Campa in the back of the building on Celis Street. And, 
supervised by Augie Maldonado, an anti-alcohol activist who received a $72,000 
grant from the San Fernando Valley Partnership in January to run youth programs 
for high-risk teens, the group meets weekly. Their next activity is a yard work 
cleanup day for senior citizens in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the organization of the events -- and the struggle, the give-and-take 
with the city and the police force -- that provide the most valuable lessons 
for the teens, Maldonado says, and the teens agree.  
</P>
<P>
 "We had a good thing going in the park," said Laura Urib, 14, one of Campa's 
boxers. "But it's even better now. We thought we'd all separate. But this is 
something unique. With the problems we had with the police, it's different. We 
stayed together. We tried to do something about the problem, and we're more 
determined to prove we can make something good happen."  
</P>
<P>
 Their enthusiasm and drive to succeed have earned them a reputation that 
extends beyond the boundaries of San Fernando. Youth organizations like the 
Blythe Street Youth Leadership group from Panorama City and students from the 
Phoenix Academy, a residential drug treatment center and school in Lake View 
Terrace, have dropped in for lessons in boxing, leadership and civics. Campa, 
who said that starting the youth boxing program was a dream he held on to 
during his 32 years in a California state prison, agrees. "They thought they 
were closing the door on us, but we just opened up a whole new one."  
</P>
<P>
 The troubles in Las Palmas Park began on Aug. 13, when two teens began 
fighting during a banquet there. Campa intervened, telling the boys to put on 
boxing gloves if they wanted to pound out their differences. The boys obliged, 
boxed for about three minutes and then shook hands. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials objected to Campa's way of handling the problem, and 
protested the lack of headgear and mouthpieces.  
</P>
<P>
 After another fight in the park during a baseball game, the City Council on 
Sept. 12 decided to ban the group from the park. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when several alleged incidents of police harassment began, teens said. 
Police Chief Dominick Rivetti confirmed that the department is investigating 
the allegations, but declined to further comment.  
</P>
<P>
 After the Sept. 12 council meeting, a group of about 10 of Campa's youths who 
attended the meeting said they were roughed up by several members of the San 
Fernando Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were walking down San Fernando Road toward the mall," said Ronnie Campa, 
20, who was with the group that evening. "A police car pulled up behind us and 
a cop started yelling at us: 'What are you guys, stupid?' He was mad because we 
crossed when the light was red." Two more squad cars then arrived, Campa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Campa said one of the officers asked Robert Vasquez, 14, whether the light was 
green when the group walked through the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bobby told the cop: 'I think the light was yellow,' " Campa said. "Some of us 
laughed. The cop slapped Robert in the face a couple of times and tried to grab 
his ear, but missed. So he pushed him against the car and twisted his arm 
behind his back. He's just a little kid."  
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, also with the group that evening, said he told the officers: "What 
you're doing isn't right." 
</P>
<P>
 "There were issues raised during that meeting that are being checked out," 
Rivetti said. "I don't release the conclusions of department investigations. 
But I can tell you the allegations had nothing to do with racial 
discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
 The teens say that since their meeting with police, there have been fewer 
problems, and the group views that as a victory: "They expected us to say 
something back to them, to like do something bad because the way they treated 
us. But Rudy and Augie, they say, 'Just be polite and show them respect,' " 
Rodriguez said, "It's not easy, but that's what we did. Even though they don't 
show us any respect."

ALHAMBRA; PROPOSITION 187 'DISCUSSION' LEADS TO ARREST OF HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN UHRICH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a heated classroom debate on Proposition 187, the only thing everyone 
seems to agree on is that an Alhambra teacher with 28 untroubled years of 
experience at the same school put his foot on a student's shoulder and was 
arrested on suspicion of battery. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eyes of the accusing student and some of his friends, all of them of 
Mexican descent, the teacher was espousing racist remarks such as "Your people 
bring disease" and then kicked the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eyes of Mark Keppel High School teacher Donald Monson, 58, and at least 
one of the student's friends, the teacher was talking about other people's 
attitudes, not his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it was racist. I thought it was just part of the debate," the 
friend, who is also Latino, said of the classroom discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Monson said the student who later accused him was misbehaving in class, 
continually standing up to shout out his views despite repeated warnings. He 
said he never intended to harm the boy, but admitted making a mistake by using 
his foot to push the youngster back into his seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been teaching for 29 years and no one has ever called me a racist 
before," Monson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident at the school offers a glimpse of the high emotions surrounding 
Proposition 187 and how those emotions color perceptions of events. 
</P>
<P>
 The students said the discussion about Proposition 187, which voters 
overwhelmingly passed Nov. 8, started Oct. 11. Although the third period 
advisory, or homeroom class, is designed to allow students time to speak with 
one another and do homework, the discussion focused on Proposition 187 and 
captured the attention of nearly all of the students. 
</P>
<P>
 Monson said he initiated the class discussion about Proposition 187 and used a 
voter pamphlet to speak about the proposition, which calls for denying health 
and education benefits to illegal immigrants. Monson, who works with the 
school's student exchange program, said he used an example of a former 
student's entry into the United States to illustrate some of the racist 
attitudes that Mexican immigrants face. 
</P>
<P>
 The accusing student's friends, who asked that their names not be published, 
said Monson had made what they considered racist remarks during a discussion 
about the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the police report, Monson had told a group of students to be 
quiet and had told one student to move away. The student moved but continued 
talking. The police report said Monson then allegedly kicked the talking 
student in the shoulder, walked away, then came back and kicked him again and 
told him to leave the classroom, using profanity. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, the student left the classroom and went to the dean's 
office. Police were called and the student decided to make a citizen's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Monson was released later that day on his own recognizance. He returned to 
work later that week.  
</P>
<P>
 In his recollection of the incident, Monson said the one student had became 
"excited" during the Proposition 187 discussion, spoke loudly to the class and 
repeatedly stood up. Monson said he used his foot to force the student to 
remain in his seat. Monson maintains he raised his foot once.  
</P>
<P>
 "I made a mistake," the soft-spoken teacher said.  
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office is expected to decide next week whether to file 
charges of misdemeanor battery.

 STRIKE UP THE BAND 
</P>
<P>
 In its big game against Beverly Hills, Culver City tossed in a wrinkle by 
putting quarterback Damon Williams at receiver and running the option with 
Rashad Stroops at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 The Centaurs struggled with their new offense in the first half and trailed, 
7-6, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, Culver City moved Williams back to quarterback and the 
offense moved the ball at will, scoring four touchdowns en route to a 35-34 
victory and 7-0 record in Ocean League play. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills Coach Carter Paysinger acknowledged his team was caught by 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you commit as many players as we do on defense, it's tough to defend 
against the option," Paysinger said. "Our defense was designed to stop their 
passing game and one-back offense. It was too late to switch." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams rushed for 82 yards and a touchdown in seven carries. When the 
Normans tried to shut down Williams, he pitched to running back Aki Wilson, who 
had 124 yards in 16 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the second-half turnaround by Culver City, Beverly Hills nearly won 
the game on an 81-yard, 14-play drive. Quarterback Chris Wallace threw a 
six-yard pass to Jeff Greenberg to cut the Normans' deficit to one with three 
seconds left. The Normans, however, failed to convert the two-point conversion 
when Aaron Kogan was stopped on a run. Kogan rushed for 185 yards and two 
touchdowns in 33 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest play of the game was the two-point conversion," said Paysinger, 
whose team used their quota of timeouts. "After we scored our touchdown, our 
band began playing. We tried to call a different play from the sidelines, but 
Chris couldn't hear us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Normans (6-4) play a true option team in Covina (8-1-1) Friday at Covina 
District Field. The Centaurs (9-1), the top-seeded team in the Southern Section 
Division VII playoffs, play host to Santa Maria (1-9). HERE'S THE CATCH 
</P>
<P>
 Tight end Tony Griffin had three receptions -- all for touchdowns -- during a 
30-18 victory over Manual Arts in a Coastal Conference game Nov. 10 at Manual 
Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin's most impressive reception came in the third quarter when he reached 
around the waist of defensive back Bobby Jones to catch the ball before running 
34 yards for a touchdown. Griffin's spectacular play gave the Comets a 30-12 
lead. STAR STRUCK 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood High senior running back Jevonni Walton had never played a down of 
organized football. Neither have five other starting offensive players for the 
Sheiks. 
</P>
<P>
 But that didn't stop the team from making history Nov. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the running of Walton, Hollywood qualified for the City Section 3-A 
Division playoffs by defeating Verdugo Hills, 21-12. The Sheiks, who finished 
5-5, earned their first berth to postseason play since 1978. The last time 
Hollywood won the City title was 1927. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no speed, no size and no experience," Hollywood Coach Bob O'Connor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walton rushed for 136 yards and two touchdowns in 21 carries. He scored on 
runs of eight and two yards and intercepted a pass on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheiks won four of their last five games to earn a spot in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood, seeded 12th, plays fifth-seeded Washington at 7 p.m. Friday at 
Banning High. BIG CHILL 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, St. Monica drove 80 yards to score the winning touchdown in its 
21-14 victory against Cantwell Sacred-Heart. On Friday, the Mariners must 
travel to Yucca Valley, which is located in the San Bernardino Mountains, 10 
miles north of Palm Springs, to open the Division IX playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing at Yucca Valley has sent a chill up St. Monica Coach Norm Lacy's 
spine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was 35 degrees during their last game," Lacy said. "We're 
preparing for the worst: howling winds and chilly rains." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners, who finished second to Harvard-Westlake in the Camino Real 
League, beat Cantwell on Steve Pulley's 15-yard pass to Jason Jones with 40 
seconds left in the game. It was Pulley's 22nd touchdown pass of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our kids are already talking about the weather and embellishing their 
stories," Lacy said. "By Friday, we'll be ready to play." SIGNINGS 
</P>
<P>
 Yasmeen Yamini-Benjamin and Erin Irving of Crossroads High signed Division I 
basketball scholarships, marking the first time two Roadrunners have committed 
during the November signing period. 
</P>
<P>
 Yamini-Benjamin signed with UC Santa Barbara and Irving signed with San Jose 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're ecstatic to have two girls receive scholarships," Crossroads Coach 
Larry Wiener said. "This is a great group of kids, and I've been very blessed 
to have the opportunity to work with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Yamini-Benjamin, a 5-foot-10 forward, averaged 12 points and nine rebounds and 
was selected to The Times' 1993 Westside girls' basketball second team. 
Yamini-Benjamin may be moved to shooting guard this season. In addition to her 
basketball skills, Yamini-Benjamin is the No.1 singles player on the school's 
tennis team. 
</P>
<P>
 Irving, a 6-foot guard, averaged 10 points a game last season. Wiener plans to 
move her to forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Roadrunner, Sherrise Smith, was selected to Street & Smith magazine's 
preseason All-American team. The 5-5 guard, a Times' first-team selection in 
1993, is expected to announce her college choice in the spring. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Susie Erickson of Marina High signed a letter of intent with the UCLA women's 
gymnastics team. Erickson is the sixth member of the SCATS gymnastics team to 
sign with the Bruins. MEN'S SOCCER 
</P>
<P>
 Seventh-ranked UCLA will play host to unranked Alabama-Birmingham in the first 
round of the NCAA tournament Sunday at UCLA North Field. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins (15-4-0) were given an at-large bid in the South Region. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA is led by forward Ante Razov, who leads the team with 12 goals and 29 
points; defender Frankie Hejduk (five goals, three assists); midfielder Eddie 
Lewis (six goals, four assists) and forward Robbie LaBelle (five goals, six 
assists). Goalkeeper Chris Snitko has a 0.58 goals against average. USC-UCLA 
RIVALRY 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA-USC football game is only one of three meetings between the 
cross-town rivals this week. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the third-ranked UCLA women's volleyball team concluded their 
regular season with a game against USC. The Bruins entered the match with 13 
consecutive victories. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, 2 1/2 hours before the football game, UCLA will play host to USC 
in men's water polo at the Rose Bowl Aquatics Center. The second-ranked Trojans 
won the two previous meetings this season. SEAN WATERS

MUSIC / DANCE; HOME TURF ; COAST BALLET STRIVES TO DEVELOP LOCAL TALENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Chris Pasles covers classical music and dance for The Times 
Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sarma and Larry Rosenberg moved from Los Angeles to Orange County in 1981 to 
start a ballet school. But they soon began setting their sights higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we trained the dancers, we saw a school wouldn't be enough," Sarma 
Rosenberg said. "We wanted to send the talented ones off some place. We started 
to look around the area. But we couldn't in good faith send them anywhere. So 
we created a company." 
</P>
<P>
 The result, Coast Ballet Theatre, which will dance Friday at Saddleback 
College in Mission Viejo, emerged in 1987 from a merger of Ballet Repertory 
(which the Rosenbergs had formed their first year here), South Coast Ballet and 
Emerson Dance Theatre. The three companies decided to pool their resources to 
build a stronger troupe, develop audiences and improve bookings. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get so many people coming to us and saying, 'How'd you get all the good 
dancers?' " Rosenberg said. "The thing is, if you train dancers, they're going 
to be everywhere. Yes, they're in New York. But how do they get to New York? 
They end up there because that's where the employment is. But they come from 
all over the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 "You give them the right training, they're going to grow and accomplish. We've 
had so many who have gone off with scholarships. There's no reason not to grow 
them here." 
</P>
<P>
 The core of the Coast Ballet consists of 12 paid dancers, augmented with 
apprentices and workshop dancers. For productions such as the "Nutcracker," "we 
pull in the whole community, about 55 to 60 people." 
</P>
<P>
 The San Clemente-based company usually dances at Saddleback or Orange Coast 
College in Costa Mesa, although it also offers educational outreach programs at 
the Orange County Performing Arts Center or Newport Harbor Art Museum, under 
the sponsorship of the center or the Philharmonic Society. Since 1990, the 
troupe has also traveled to Laughlin, Nevada, to present its "Nutcracker.' 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, we actually started a spring season there, too," Rosenberg said. 
"We take all those people to Nevada with us." (Coast Ballet will dance its 
"Nutcracker" Dec. 15 through 18 at Saddleback.) 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these bookings, Coast Ballet still doesn't reach the numbers it wants. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel the unfortunate thing is that we don't get to show the company often 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem is money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're scrambling, like any company," she said, declining to give the yearly 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 But it isn't for want of trying.

 "We called the (Saddleback) program, 'Fall in Love With Ballet,' " she said. 
"Ballet is in trouble. We want to attract audiences to come see the ballet and 
find out that it is entertaining." 
</P>
<P>
 So Rosenberg has planned a range of works, from the classical -- excerpts from 
Petipa's "Paquita" -- to several of her own works, which also span the serious 
to the appealing. These include "Bellum, Pax et Spes," a 1988 piece that has 
been taken into the repertory of the Riga Ballet Company in Latvia; the new "Le 
Baiser de la Muse," and "Beach Blanket Ballet." 
</P>
<P>
 She called "Bellum" an "allegorical pas de trois." 
</P>
<P>
 "As in many works you want the audience to have their own spin on it," she 
said. "They can see it as a love triangle or more allegorical struggle between 
war and peace for hope." 
</P>
<P>
 "Le Baiser de la Muse" is set to parts of Stravinsky's "Le Baiser de la Fee," 
in which "Stravinsky is paying homage to Tchaikovsky. I pay homage to both of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 In "Beach Blanket Ballet," Rosenberg said she is "trying to make the point 
that dance, ballet, can cover any mood, any time period, depending on how you 
use it. Ballet is basically a vocabulary. You can express any subject. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a California girl. I was out on the beach with all those surfers. I 
grant it's lightweight, but still there are technical elements that I feel make 
it valid."

POP; BACK TO THE BEAT; THE GO-GO'S BATTLE THOSE BUBBLY MEDIA TAGS TO RETURN, 
NINE YEARS AFTER THE BREAKUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Mike Boehm covers pop music for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Playing media tag is one of the prerogatives of being a rock star. 
</P>
<P>
 But once tagged with a simple "it," a snappy, easy-to-digest image suitable 
for mass-retailing, "it" may be all the star is perceived to be. 
</P>
<P>
 The Go-Go's were rock's "it" girls of the early '80s: the first all-female 
band ever to make it big. They were celebrated for their fun-loving charm, for 
their best-buddies camaraderie, and for the garagey pop songs that propelled 
their first album, "Beauty and the Beat," to a six-week stay at the top of the 
charts. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, Charlotte Caffey, the lead guitarist, reduces the Go-Go's 
defining "it" to three words that she mouths with a blend of frustration, 
irony, and what-can-you-do-about-it resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cute, bubbly, effervescent."  
</P>
<P>
 The words practically hang there in quotation marks above the cushy gray couch 
where Caffey sits in a North Hollywood rehearsal room, flanked by two fellow 
Go-Go's, rhythm guitarist Jane Wiedlin and bassist Kathy Valentine. In front of 
them on a wooden coffee table lies the Aug. 5, 1982, edition of Rolling Stone 
magazine, the one with the cover photo of five young women horsing around in 
chaste white undies, like junior high school girls at a slumber party. The 
headline, blocked out in pink letters, reads, "Go-Go's Put Out." It might as 
well have said, "Tag, You're It." 
</P>
<P>
 The Go-Go's are not reluctant to dissect their past misadventures in the 
image-retailing game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that we weren't that way, but there were other sides to us," Caffey 
says. The argument is partly supported by the 1981-vintage "Beauty and the 
Beat," which had its moments of winking irony to go with the cute, frothy 
stuff, and it is completely clinched by the darker, troubled tone of the band's 
third and last album before their breakup in 1985, the critically esteemed but 
commercially disappointing "Talk Show" (1984). 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still trying to sort out in my mind how much we were responsible for it," 
ventures Valentine. "Society was going, 'Here's a successful girl band.' It's 
almost like we couldn't be accepted and embraced . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless we were non-threatening," Wiedlin finishes the thought. "If we had 
been angry, it wouldn't have worked." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what's so great now," Valentine resumes. "Women (rockers) are accepted 
as being sexual, angry, crude -- all the things it was acceptable for guys to 
be all along." 
</P>
<P>
 Seasoned by past pitfalls, cognizant of present possibilities, the Go-Go's are 
back.  
</P>
<P>
 While the three guitar-playing members expounded last week during a 
pre-rehearsal interview, drummer Gina Schock, who had brought in the Rolling 
Stone copy so the band could autograph it for a friend, stepped out for a long 
break after concluding that they were having no problem handling questions 
without her. Singer Belinda Carlisle, who emerged as a glossy, slick-sounding 
pop diva after the Go-Go's broke up, had an excused absence: she had just flown 
in from France, where she now lives with her film producer husband and their 
toddler son, and was being given the day off to recuperate from jet-lag. 
</P>
<P>
 The immediate cause of the band's return is the recent release of "Return to 
the Valley of the Go-Go's," a double-disc retrospective of hits and rarities. 
As they did in 1990, when they regrouped for the first time to play an 
environmental benefit concert and promote the release of a greatest hits 
package, the Go-Go's will do a short tour, which begins Sunday at the Coach 
House, and also includes shows Dec. 1 and 2 at the Wiltern Theatre in Los 
Angeles. Vicki Peterson, the former Bangles guitarist, will fill in for the 
six-months'-pregnant Caffey, who decided it would be best to avoid the rigors 
of the road and concert stage until after her February due-date. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the Go-Go's aim to keep their reunion going. The members say that 
touring in 1990 enabled them to get over whatever hurt feelings remained from 
the band's bitter initial split. When they heard that their old label, I.R.S. 
Records, was preparing a more complete retrospective release, the Go-Go's, who 
weren't happy with the 1990 hits package, decided to reconvene for the sake of 
quality control, and to top off the album with new material that brings the 
story of the band full-circle. 
</P>
<P>
 "This retrospective was going to be put out with or without our involvement, 
and it was a perfect excuse to get together again," Carlisle said in a phone 
interview the day after the missed rehearsal. The band members dipped into 
their personal archives for tapes of early gigs and rehearsals, thereby casting 
fresh light on the Go-Go's origins on the Los Angeles punk scene in 1978-79. 
They also wrote nine new songs and recorded three of them for the album: "Good 
Girl," "Beautiful," and "The Whole World Lost Its Head," which has been made 
into a video. All are catchy, overtly ironic garage-pop fare; the revived band 
features a Carlisle who sings in a more burry and expressive voice than she 
could muster a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Pleased with the results, the five Go-Go's say they want to press on. 
</P>
<P>
 "It inspires us to want to make another record together," said Carlisle, who 
also plans to record her sixth solo album early next year. "That's a big 
possibility down the line. I don't know about any heavy touring schedule; 
everybody has their families and their own projects. But there's definitely 
time to get together and at least write, spend the next year coming up with new 
material and recording it at the end of the year or whatever. It's a very 
feasible thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Reunions such as the Go-Go's' are also a very trendy thing to do. With 
nostalgia dawning for '80s New Wave music (an inevitability, now that the high 
school class of '81 has pushed past 30), it could prove the most commercially 
feasible thing to do as well. Take into account the fact that the post-Go-Go's 
careers of Caffey, Wiedlin, Valentine and Schock have been fitful at best, and 
that Carlisle's solo sales have dwindled following the gold and platinum 
success of her first three albums, and there is no shortage of potential 
ammunition for scoffers who want to level charges of opportunism. 
</P>
<P>
 The Go-Go's hope to arm themselves against such attack with persuasive new 
songs.  
</P>
<P>
 "The way I keep looking at it, there are opportunities that keep coming to 
bring us back together, and this time we're not going to fight it," says 
Caffey, invoking fate. 
</P>
<P>
 "When something feels really good and right, we go by our instincts," adds 
Wiedlin. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way we'll know if the Go-Go's have artistic validity or mean 
anything is to do a record," Valentine says, putting in the final word on 
whether the Go-Go's story merits a second act. "We made ourselves really happy 
with (the new songs) we've recorded. I don't want to feel we have something to 
prove." 
</P>
<P>
 The Go-Go's retake the field at a time when the prevailing mood in rock has 
swung around to the opposite of cute, bubbly and effervescent. As the band's 
comeback single remarks in passing, with some satisfaction, "punk rock isn't 
dead." And some of those young punks, with their songs glowering and noisy, 
might be inclined to write off the Go-Go's as lightweights. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiedlin says she is pleased that the new retrospective chronicles the band's 
punk origins. At the same time, she acknowledges, the image that set in later 
could be something "to overcome, almost." 
</P>
<P>
 The otherwise affable Caffey sharpens her tone and throws in some 
well-enunciated expletives at the thought that the Go-Go's might be given 
anything but respect for their part in breaking down the old stereotype that 
groupie and chick singer were the only positions in rock for which women need 
apply. 
</P>
<P>
 "Against all odds and obstructions in our way, we were just doing it. We 
didn't necessarily write about women's rights or talk about it. We were just 
doing it. If you want to call punk an attitude, it's still with us. Being in a 
band is being punk, no matter what. You have to dedicate your life to it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Go-Go's applaud the attention being given to Liz Phair, L7, Hole, and 
others in the parade of women rockers who have become prominent in the '90s. 
And they say they don't worry if those musicians neglect to cite the Go-Go's' 
contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Valentine says she never gave credit to the Go-Go's' female predecessors, such 
as the Runaways, the teen-age glam-rock band of the mid-'70s that was put 
together as a novelty by a record producer. "But to be totally honest, when I 
saw the Runaways, I was totally jealous," she recalled. "I wanted to be in the 
band. Suzi Quatro -- I flipped out. I never gave them credit when we were doing 
interviews, so I don't blame ('90s women) now" if they gloss over the Go-Go's 
when they talk about influences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to get to the point where there's never a women-in-rock article 
again," Valentine concluded. "But we were the first ones to have some success, 
to reach No. 1, and that belongs in a women-in-rock article." 
</P>
<P>
 In their first run, whatever measure of dedication and pioneering spirit the 
Go-Go's possessed was ultimately not enough to withstand the pressures of being 
young and suddenly famous. Infighting set in, and Caffey and Carlisle later 
admitted that they were hampered by serious substance abuse problems. Wiedlin 
was the first to leave, in 1984. Caffey and Carlisle gave up drugs, then 
decided upon sober reflection that they didn't want to be Go-Go's any more. 
They declared the band finis in the spring of '85, to the considerable chagrin 
of Valentine and Schock. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlisle went on to her solo successes, bringing along Caffey as a songwriting 
collaborator and a member of her backing band. Caffey, who is married to Jeff 
McDonald, singer of the thrash-pop band, Redd Kross, also formed an all-female 
band, the Graces, which released an album in 1989. Schock's solo career 
amounted to just one record, the 1988 release, "House of Schock." Wiedlin, who 
now lives in the San Diego County community of Escondido, put out three solo 
albums between 1985 and 1990, then decided to take some time off before 
resuming her songwriting about a year ago. Valentine vacillated between hard 
rock and traditional blues and R&B, and still hasn't managed to put out an 
album.  
</P>
<P>
 Carlisle, meanwhile, says she has focused primarily on the European market in 
recent years. In January, she left Los Angeles for a country home in the south 
of France. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Los Angeles last week, she spent a morning doing demos for another 
glossy solo album (she says the European audience didn't go for the somewhat 
less slick '60s-influenced sound of her 1993 album, "Real," so she's returning 
to the mainstream pop stuff), then turned up at an afternoon rehearsal to 
acclimate herself once more to rocking with the Go-Go's. 
</P>
<P>
 On the phone afterward, she said she has no problem going back and forth 
between two distant stylistic poles. "It's two separate things I love doing," 
she said. "I love the sort of raunchy pop (that the Go-Go's play), that garagey 
sound, and I love the classic pop song, which is what I grew up with on the 
radio. It's not hard switching gears at all. The Go-Go's sometimes feels far 
more comfortable than being on my own. It's the comfort of having four other 
people up there." 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the Go-Go's have a strategy for not having five different people 
falling into the kinds of internecine struggles that destroyed the band the 
first time around. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our formative years were just a pressure cooker," Wiedlin said. "We don't 
want to have that again. You have to take care of each other, otherwise this 
machine just eats you alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, the members were in their early to mid-20s. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to do every single thing we were told," Valentine said, which led to 
a frazzling pace of recording and touring. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had no experience at all. We thought it's what every band did," Caffey 
added. "It was insane." 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Go-Go's are in their mid-30s, except for Caffey, a still-fresh-looking 
40. Their second go at being a recording band figures to be more stable and 
settled. "Now," Valentine says, "We can say, 'We need to take a weekend off.' 
We know we're not going to ruin our careers or the success of the record. We're 
just reserving the right to say no." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlisle agrees that a low stress quotient is vital if a reunion is to take. 
"We're not putting any pressure on ourselves. We don't have any concrete game 
plan. We just have the desire to do a record, and we're winging it as we go 
along. Getting serious and intense about it is going to take the enjoyment out. 
I want to have fun with it." 
</P>
<P>
 In their rehearsal room, fun and mutual acceptance seem to be running strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiedlin, a pixie-like woman who looks young enough in her knit ski cap and 
flannel shirt to play Winona Ryder's kid sister, starts the interview by 
admonishing Valentine: "You're picking. Stop it." 
</P>
<P>
 Valentine takes this bit of mothering (or is it older-sistering?) without 
annoyance. "No I'm not. I'm stroking my chin." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, as they run through their live set (sans Carlisle's singing), the two 
will join in a kick-step game of footsie as they knock out the beat of "We Got 
the Beat." 
</P>
<P>
 Schock, who looked as if she had gotten up too early when she first walked in, 
is now smiling as she slams crisply on her kit. During breaks, she is ready 
with salty quips. Peterson, the substitute player, is all diligence and serious 
concentration as she works to get down her parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Caffey plays the coach, listening from the couch while holding a pad full of 
song titles jotted in blue ink, occasionally suggesting changes in the song 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's cool to watch," she says of her new vantage point on the sidelines. The 
other day, she recalled, "I was saying, 'Yeah, it's a great band.' I was gonna 
cry . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Whereupon Valentine, overhearing the expectant mom, spun around and gave her a 
hug. 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . but maybe it's 'cause I'm all hormonal." 
</P>
<P>
 * Who: The Go-Go's. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Sunday, Nov. 20, at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: The Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Where to call: (714) 496-8930. MORE POP 
</P>
<P>
 IN SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO: BRUCE COCKBURN 
</P>
<P>
 Like his more famous Canadian countryman, Neil Young, Cockburn is a strong 
rock triple threat who can write, sing and support himself with expert guitar 
work. He'll play a solo show at the Coach House on Wednesday, Nov. 23, drawing 
from his new album, "Dart to the Heart." (714) 496-8930. 
</P>
<P>
 IN SANTA ANA: BOY HOWDY 
</P>
<P>
 This Orange County/Los Angeles band raised its national profile recently with 
a couple of hit ballads, but its forte is crackling, expertly played 
rockin'-country music. Celebrate the release of a new single, "True to His 
Word," at the Crazy Horse Steak House on Monday, Nov. 21. (714) 549-1512. 
</P>
<P>
 IN IRVINE: PENNYWISE 
</P>
<P>
 Like Bad Religion and the Offspring, Pennywise plays hard-hitting, melodic 
punk rock. With two successful albums, the band has to be regarded as a 
potential successor to the Offspring and Green Day. Pennywise plays at UC 
Irvine's Crawford Hall on Saturday, Nov. 19. (714) 824-5000.

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Various Artists 
</P>
<P>
 "Kwanzaa Music" 
</P>
<P>
 Rounder Records  
</P>
<P>
 Kwanzaa, a Swahili term meaning "first fruits of the harvest," is the name 
given to an increasingly popular African-American holiday, which annually 
unfolds from Dec. 26 through Jan. 1. Though aspects of it are synthesized from 
African tradition, it is an infant as holidays go. Kwanzaa was originated in 
1965 by Dr. Maulana Karenga (now Chairman of Black Studies at CSU Long Beach). 
</P>
<P>
 It is a blessing that this holiday hasn't yet been targeted by the mawkish 
tunesmiths who have buried Christmas in confectioners sugar. But what's a 
holiday without music? Much as Dr. Karenga appropriated existing traditions for 
his holiday, this album compiles existing music from "the African diaspora," as 
the liner notes put it. And it makes for one funky holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a tremendous variety here: contemporary African music from its Arab 
regions to its South African tip; American soul and funk songs, as well as New 
Orleans carnival music; Caribbean and South American music; and a pan-cultural 
rap-jazz hybrid. Yet, for all the diversity, there are also connections in the 
music, and it all pulses with the rhythms of life.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the presence of such giants as Aretha Franklin and James Brown, the 
real delights here are the tracks by unknowns and lesser legends. Among them, 
the late Clifton Chenier gives a Louisiana accordion workout to "Bon Ton 
Roulet," while ethereal yet earthy Malian singer Oumou Sangare plays an 
enticing call-and-response with a violin and a vocal chorus on "Ko Sira." The 
Baha Men mix their island pop with a lowrider bass line on "Back to the 
Island." 
</P>
<P>
 "I Am So Glad" by Bahamian singers Bruce Green, Tweedie Gibson and Clifton 
Green sounds like a haunting cross between American gospel and South African 
choral music. And, as ever, South Africa's Mahlathini and the Mahotella Queens 
deliver a spirited mix of modern African pop and traditional "groaner" vocals 
on "Thokozile." 
</P>
<P>
 The only quibble with this album is that there should have been more volumes. 
In the amount of space afforded here, blues is underrepresented -- with one 
less-than-spectacular Gatemouth Brown track -- reggae gets short shrift and 
jazz is all-but overlooked. On the plus side, the extensive liner notes include 
a recipe for black-eyed pea salad. JIM WASHBURN

 The Zombies 
</P>
<P>
 "Odessey and Oracle" (1968) 
</P>
<P>
 Rhino  
</P>
<P>
 In quality, if not fame, "Odessey and Oracle" ranks as one of the peak 
examples of '60s pop-rock, a worthy peer of any album issued by the Beatles, 
the Beach Boys or the Kinks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zombies first made their mark with two British Invasion hits from '64-65, 
"She's Not There" and "Tell Her No." By 1967, the two songwriters, keyboard 
player Rod Argent and bassist Chris White, had decided to disband the Zombies 
in favor of a new group, Argent. "Odessey and Oracle" was, as Argent wrote in 
the notes to Rhino's 1987 reissue, conceived as "a parting gesture . . . a very 
personal final album" to be recorded free of careerist considerations." Score 
one for artistic purity: The album not only is a rich trove of melody, harmony, 
lyrical intelligence, adventurous song-arranging and the twin-tower brilliance 
of Argent's instrumental work and breathy-voiced Colin Blunstone's now-breezy, 
now passionate singing, but it yielded a monster hit single, "Time of the 
Season." True to their intentions, the Zombies didn't use the hit as an excuse 
to weasel out of their commitment to disband (nor did they explain why they had 
planted a deliberate misspelling in the album's title). 
</P>
<P>
 The Zombies' willingness to run free with their imaginations yielded a song 
collection of wide thematic scope. Instead of a standard missing-the-girl 
scenario, they give us "Care of Cell 44," in which a forgiving Blunstone 
breathlessly awaits the release of his jailed amour. "A Rose for Emily" loosely 
takes its inspiration from a classic short story by William Faulkner, leaving 
out the macabre elements of the original as it offers a delicate portrait of a 
lonely old woman crippled and sustained by pride. "Butcher's Tale (Western 
Front 1914)" is unsparing in its depiction of war's horrors. It is one of the 
greatest anti-war songs in the rock canon; Blunstone struggles to keep control 
of his trembling, contorted voice as he spills forth the fear and anger of a 
man who knows what it is to be reduced to cannon fodder and knows whom to blame 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere the Zombies conjure sultry sensuality or evoke, hauntingly, the 
luminous comforts and deep aches that attend both loving and remembering. It 
all makes "Odessey and Oracle" one of the great pleasures available to fans of 
ambitious pop, an album that truly does stand beyond time and beyond season.

WANNA DANCE?: NEWPORT'S THUNDERBIRD IS REVVED UP FOR SATURDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES, Rose Apodaca Jones is a free-lance writer who 
contributes regularly to the Times Orange County Edition.

<P>
 If two heads are better than one, consider the possibilities of four. 
</P>
<P>
 What would happen if there were a meeting of the minds among four of Orange 
County's longtime nightclub promoters who decided to join forces and open a 
super-club together? 
</P>
<P>
 What would happen is Thunderbird, in Newport Beach's Lido Village. It will 
open Saturday night in the building formerly housing Bacchus and the Magic 
Island, powered by a partnership that could very well strike like lightning 
among clubgoers. 
</P>
<P>
 The riders of this storm are owners Gregg Mullholland, Mike Tuomisto and 
Jonathan (Scorchman) Marshall, along with promoter and friend Johnny Drummond, 
who claims a full-time staff position. 
</P>
<P>
 Their resumes are impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 Mullholland and Tuomisto are responsible for building and running the Empire 
Ballroom earlier this year. Tuomisto was also a partner in last decade's 
splashy NYC. Marshall has promoted once-a-week clubs at the Warehouse, the Red 
Onion, Metropolis, the Shark Club, Bacchus and a host of other places since the 
mid-'80s. Drummond has entertained yuppie surfers with his highly successful, 
club-jumping Johnny's Joint. 
</P>
<P>
 Call them the dream team of local clublife. 
</P>
<P>
 United, they plan to take a crack at the two-story building that has always 
been considered a potential hot spot, but whose former owners had trouble 
sustaining the heat. With the incredibly popular Visions across the way at the 
Warehouse, the mellower Atlantis down the block and the post-nightclub 
coffeehouse Not Just Java around the side, the Lido Village should turn into 
the raging 'hood it has long aspired to become. 
</P>
<P>
 Thunderbird owners completed renovations on the 17,000-square-foot building in 
an impressive 60 days. Walls were pulled down or stripped to reveal their brick 
base. Windows were carved into walls to give patrons access to a bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone is the Egyptian motif. In its place, the walls have been sponged, combed 
and washed in luscious scarlet red and royal blue. The ornate moldings have 
been gilded or plated silver and the Roman columns wrapped in faux cheetah and 
tiger fur. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, a canopy of red neon tubes topped by a glowing red, blue and yellow 
T-bird logo leads patrons into the refurbished club. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the few features still remaining is the stationary elevator in the 
entrance, a trick of the former Magic Island, which gives riders the illusion 
of sinking below street level. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrons first enter the piano bar, which has been gussied up to resemble a 
fancy schmaltzy cocktail lounge doused in red and gold. A pianist and singer 
will camp out near the baby grand on some nights, while on others deejays will 
spin an eclectic mix of vintage lounge, blues and garage ditties or a band will 
deliver the sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the building's signature twisting halls, past the hideaway alcoves, 
guests will come across the Roadrunner room with its two pool tables and photo 
collection of vintage performance cars. Beyond this room is the dance hall, 
which is expected to keep revelers groovin' to hip-hop, house and disco. 
</P>
<P>
 The former cinema room, which played silent films, has been catapulted into 
the future with a virtual reality ride, not unlike the one developed for Peter 
Gabriel. The contraption will be in place and ready for takeoff in December. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant has been brought downstairs -- next to the kitchen to avoid the 
regular strife waiters used to endure by continuously running meals up the 
stairs. The staff isn't totally off the hook, of course, since anyone in the 
upstairs lounge can order dinner and have it delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 Toukan promises an affordable menu of Cajun and Caribbean dishes, from jerk 
fish to gumbo, by New Orleans chef Gil Guilty. Most entrees will go for $8 to 
$10. Diners will indulge in the thick of jungle foliage, listen to a nearby 
waterfall and be tended by casual waiters who might take the liberty of sitting 
with guests. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners hope Toukan will become a hangout for hungry locals. The bamboo chairs 
seat 250 diners. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant will be open nightly, except Mondays. When the club is not 
open, a side entrance will provide access. On club nights, patrons here to dine 
and dance can skip the cover and be escorted to the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading upstairs, patrons will notice the reconstructive changes the most. The 
deejay booth is gone, as is the wall that divided the upstairs lobby and the 
hall. An enormous, round settee anchors the center of the room, surrounded by 
five pool tables. The tables will be moved around when live bands are featured 
on Thursdays. Live or Memorex, the room will always feature a soundtrack for 
shooting stick, such as rock, blues, jazz and acid jazz for those wishing to 
escape the dance thump below. 
</P>
<P>
 Next door is the Locals Lounge, a blue room where partiers can poop out as the 
night progresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Thunderbird will kick it off this Saturday and every one thereafter with Danny 
Z and Scorchman at the turntables in the dance hall.  
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 25, Johnny's Joint finds a permanent home with deejay Priest. Drummond 
will personalize the evening with two oyster-shooter bars serving up a 
concoction of ginseng jelly, lemon, horseradish, cocktail sauce, premium vodka 
and an oyster. Shoot it and be spritzed with Evian and sea plasma for $7. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 1, Thunder Thursdays will ensue, with deejay Mark Moreno (of Empire, 
Lava Lounge) downstairs and a live band showcase upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Appropriate nightclub attire is requested on the weekends. What exactly that 
entails, the guys refused to specify, only saying that common sense should 
prevail.

KID STUFF: IT'S MUSIC TO LITTLE EARS; PACIFIC SYMPHONY'S 'KNUCKLE BUSTERS' 
SHOWS YOUNGSTERS THE FUN SIDE OF CLASSICAL WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, Corinne Flocken is a free-lance writer who regularly covers 
Kid Stuff for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the movie "Amadeus," Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart presents one of his 
compositions to a skeptical Emperor Joseph II. The piece is dazzling, performed 
with the flashing intensity of a thunderstorm, but the emperor is unimpressed. 
The music, he yawns with a languid wave of his hankie, has "too many notes." 
</P>
<P>
 There are many who share the emperor's view of classical music. After all, 
torrents of notes delivered by sober-faced musicians in a stuffy concert hall 
can be pretty intimidating, and bored indifference is a sure-fire defense 
against things daunting. Given this, you may wonder why the Pacific Symphony 
Orchestra would bother with a children's concert series. If adults are put off 
by classical music, why in heaven's name would they want to drag their kids to 
hear it? 
</P>
<P>
 Because symphonic music is not only good for the soul, it's also a heck of a 
lot of fun, say the folks at the orchestra. And to prove it, the Santa 
Ana-based orchestra has spent 11 seasons coordinating a family concert series 
to acquaint children (and their infinitely more closed-minded adult companions) 
with the value of classical music. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mervyn's Musical Mornings concerts, six this season, typically feature a 
common kid-friendly theme such as holidays or the circus, along with a little 
humor and some audience participation, mostly through informal dialogue between 
the listeners and the conductor.  
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Pacific Symphony takes that a giant step further with "Knuckle 
Busters," a program of mostly lightning-fast musical selections (or, as 
assistant conductor Edward Cumming, the series' director, puts it, "They all 
have lots and lots of notes") strung together in a lighthearted, quasi-musical 
theater piece performed by L.A.'s Kidd Street Dance Theatre. Intended for ages 
4 to 13, "Knuckle Busters" will be presented at 10 and 11:30 a.m. in Segerstrom 
Hall at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd Street artistic director Timothy Kuster created the script for "Knuckle 
Busters" this summer, with input from Cumming and other members of the 
orchestra's educational staff. The 30-year-old writer, dancer and composer used 
as his foundation a previously selected program that includes Leroy Anderson's 
"The Typewriter," Leopold Mozart's "The Toy Symphony" and the opening Allegro 
of Shostakovich's Piano Concerto No. 2. If it plays as well as it reads, the 
tale will link the music with humor and dance and, in the process, give 
audiences an easily digestible lesson in basic musical technique. 
</P>
<P>
 "Knuckle Busters" is written in a standard musical-theater style. There's an 
overture (Smetana's Overture to "The Bartered Bride"), followed by a scene, 
followed by a musical selection, followed by a scene, and so on until the big 
finish, in this case, the finale of Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 4. Guiding the 
action on stage is Prof. Frederick Fidget (Kuster), an affable, absent-minded 
fix-it meister whose help is solicited by Herr Konduktor (Cumming) when his 
orchestra "breaks down." 
</P>
<P>
 Aided by his two assistants, Ludwig and Haydwig (5-year-olds Ryan Lepone and 
Devon Irete), Fidget, whose pidgin German results in some comic lingual 
foul-ups, helps Herr Konduktor remedy a variety of musical ills.  
</P>
<P>
 He teaches him how to use a "schtick" ("Baton, schmaton! It's just a fancy 
word for schtick!"). After the audience and his assistants point out the 
problem, he also repairs the muffled sound of a grand piano by removing stuffed 
animals from under the lid, a bit that segues into a solo performance of the 
Shostakovich piece by the concert's guest artist, 16-year-old Patty Huang of 
Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra returns the favor by providing musical backdrops to Fidget's 
projects. A broken "Schreibmaschine" is tested to Anderson's "The Typewriter" 
(listeners are asked to help out by flinging their heads with each carriage 
return, and mechanical toys, danced by 11 Kidd Street performers ages 5 to 13, 
are fine-tuned to a performance of "The Toy Symphony" aided by a small band of 
slide whistles, kazoos and drums played by children from the orchestra's 
Wunderkinder club. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he works primarily in Los Angeles, Kuster has collaborated with 
Orange County groups before. With Hector Armiento, he co-wrote "Un Camino de 
Fe" ("A Journey of Faith"), a bilingual children's opera based on a story by 
12-year-old Sagrario Gil of Santa Ana that is scheduled to tour local schools 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always open to projects dealing with children because they're so open to 
information; they suck it up like a sponge," said Kuster, who has taught dance 
and theater to children since he was a sophomore at Cal State Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always encourage kids to take advantage of live concerts and ballets, but 
not because I think they could all become professional dancers or actors."  
</P>
<P>
 Exposing children to the performing arts is important because "it helps 
children appreciate live art for its own sake," added Kuster. "They can see 
what goes into it and then decide whether they want to become ballerinas or 
musicians or plumbers or presidents of the United States. It has to be their 
own choice."

EVENTS; MARIACHI MUSIC FOR MANY KINDS OF EARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTHANNE SALIDO, Ruthanne Salido is a member of the Times Orange County 
Edition staff.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Think mariachi music, and you think traditional Mexican tunes. But Juan M. 
Elias wants the music to make you think pop, classical and big band, too. 
</P>
<P>
 As executive director of Los Ninos Production Co., he is involved in putting 
on the second annual Orange County International Mariachi Festival on Saturday 
evening. The festival attempts to deliver not only traditional songs for the 
purists, but also contemporary sounds for the uninitiated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to expand our audience, to reach out to people who haven't been 
exposed to mariachi music before," Elias said. "We feel we have something for 
everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 At last year's event, mariachi groups performed Disney tunes, including "It's 
a Small World" and the theme from "Pinocchio," in addition to traditional 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
 At this year's event, which will be at the Anaheim Convention Center and is 
expected to attract about 7,000, the highlight will be twofold: a performance 
by Lucero, a popular singer and actress in Mexico, and several production 
numbers involving all four mariachi groups on the bill, Lucero and a 49-member 
folk dance troupe. 
</P>
<P>
 The troupe, Ballet Folklorico de San Juan, based in Tucson, will kick off the 
3 1/2-hour show. The first band to perform will be Placentia-based Mariachi 
Tlaquepaque. Next up will be the all-female Las Perlitas Tapatias of 
Guadalajara. South El Monte-based Mariachi Sol de Mexico de Jose Hernandez, 
which likes to have fun with big-band numbers during its set, will follow. 
After the intermission, Mexico City-based Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlan, which 
has been performing for almost a century in various incarnations and has been 
dubbed by those in the know as "the world's greatest mariachi band," will 
perform solo and then with Lucero. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Ninos' selection of Jose Ronstadt, affiliated with Spanish-language 
television network Telemundo (and cousin of singer Linda Ronstadt), to emcee is 
also an example of Elias' desire to make the music accessible to newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 25% to 30% of the audience doesn't speak Spanish," so Los Ninos picked 
Ronstadt, who will emcee in both Spanish and English, "so everybody knows 
what's going on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the music can transcend age barriers.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have parents with their children and grandparents with their 
grandchildren" attending the festival, Elias said. "Any time you can reach that 
many age groups, that's beautiful and rewarding." 
</P>
<P>
 * What: Orange County International Mariachi Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Saturday, Nov. 19, at 7 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 * Where: Anaheim Convention Center, 800 W. Katella Ave., Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whereabouts: Exit the Santa Ana (5) Freeway at Harbor Boulevard south. 
Proceed south on Harbor, then take a right onto Katella Avenue. The center is 
on the left at the first traffic signal. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wherewithal: Tickets are $18.50, $28.50, $38.50, $45.50 and $56.50. They can 
be purchased by phone or at the door.

 Running events within Laguna Beach proper are a rarity. The annual School 
Power run is the only one held on a regular basis. The city simply doesn't 
allow too many races on its narrow and often busy streets. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Saturday debut of a new Laguna Beach run is sufficient cause for 
runners to sit up and take notice. Unlike the School Power run, the new Run for 
a Reason 5K run and walk doesn't veer into Laguna Canyon, instead staying close 
to downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be our new annual event," said Sarah Kasman, director of 
Laguna Shanti, the sponsors and beneficiaries of the race. Laguna Shanti has 
been offering emotional and practical support to HIV-infected people and those 
with other life-threatening illnesses since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal, she said, is to make the Run for a Reason a regular stop on the 
circuit for serious local runners, and, at the same time, she hopes the run and 
walk are short and pleasant enough to attract more casual participants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking to attract approximately 1,000 people, between runners and 
walkers," Kasman said, a healthy total for a first-time event.  
</P>
<P>
 The course, including hills, starts at City Hall and takes in parts of 
Glenneyre Street, Forest Avenue and Third Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope that runners will find it challenging, but not too long a race," 
Kasman said. "We feel fortunate that the city has allowed us to hold this 
event." 
</P>
<P>
 After the competition, race and run, there will be an awards ceremony at 
Laguna Shanti, with entertainment and a pancake breakfast, included in the $25 
race fee. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit Laguna Shanti serves primarily South County, but a recent grant 
will allow it to extend some of its services countywide. Among its support 
offerings are home-delivered meals, transportation, individual and group 
counseling and buddy programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Shanti has about 175 volunteers at any given time, Kasman said, adding 
that it has served about 350 clients and their families this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Upper Newport Bay will be the site of a work project Saturday from 9 a.m. to 1 
p.m. Volunteers are asked to bring their work gloves and help rid the 
ecological reserve of Pampas grass and other exotic intruders that are choking 
out native species. For information, call (714) 640-6746. 
</P>
<P>
 * What: Run for a Reason 5K run and walk. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Saturday, Nov. 19. Registration is at 6:30 a.m., with the run at 8 
a.m. and the walk at 8:20 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: Starts and finishes at Laguna Beach City Hall, Third Street and 
Forest Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whereabouts: Take Laguna Canyon Road south into Laguna Beach; signs will 
direct runners to parking areas near Forest Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wherewithal: $25 (includes T-shirt, breakfast and entertainment). 
</P>
<P>
 * Where to call: (714) 494-1446.

REWIND; ROACHES PUT THEIR PEST FOOT FORWARD IN 'TWILIGHT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Any movie that casts cockroaches as sympathetic characters takes a huge risk 
of alienating its entire audience even before the opening credits roll. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Twilight of the Cockroaches," a funny, twisted tale of man-versus-pest 
told from the pests' perspective, proves that such wild risks can offer great 
rewards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese-made film, combining live action and animation, chronicles the 
last days of a carefree tribe of cockroaches living in a sloppy bachelor's 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 The human bachelor coexists peacefully with the happy-go-lucky vermin, until 
he begins dating a woman who doesn't share his live-and-let-live approach to 
the scavengers. The roach squishing and bug-bombing that follow threaten to 
wipe out the entire cockroach tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 Naomi, a young cockroach (she's "19, in roach years"), is the protagonist of 
the tongue-in-cheek tale. She becomes embroiled in a love triangle and must 
choose between her loving fiance, Ichiro, and Hans, a brave warrior bug from 
another tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 She's one of the first to discover that some humans believe the only good 
roaches are dead ones. While out walking late at night, she's attacked by a 
woman with a rolled-up magazine. She escapes, but soon several other roaches 
are slain by a human. 
</P>
<P>
 Ichiro tells her not to worry. 
</P>
<P>
 "This must be an isolated case of madness," he says with conviction. "Humans 
love cockroaches." 
</P>
<P>
 But the tribal leaders begin to realize the times are changing and start 
rallying the troops for a full-scale counterattack. In one scene, the warriors 
prepare for battle, singing, "We are the cockroach soldiers, start a fight and 
we get bolder!" 
</P>
<P>
 The movie is also a visual pleasure, with lots of floor-level camera angles 
that provide a roach's-eye view of the world. And because the sounds made by 
the human characters are amplified ominously throughout the film, viewers get a 
roach's-ear perspective as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the scenes mixing live action (the humans) and animation (the roaches) 
are wildly funny, such as the one in which the bachelor watches in drunken 
amusement at playful roaches throwing a massive party on his kitchen counter 
and coffee table. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people, even those who aren't hard-core roach haters, will probably 
derive a grim satisfaction from the scenes of cartoon carnage. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the characters are likable and don't look terribly roach-like, so 
viewers may be surprised to find themselves actually rooting for the crawly 
critters.  
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twilight of the Cockroaches" (1987), directed by Hiroaki Yoshido. 105 
minutes. Not rated. JON NALICK

KIDS ON FILM: YOUNGSTERS OF THE '90S BELIEVE IN A MORE MODERN 'MIRACLE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

section.

<P>
 In "Miracle on 34th Street," partially updated characters replay the 1947 
original in which a friendly, bewhiskered old man (Richard Attenborough) who 
believes he is the real Santa Claus winds up convincing a reality-first single 
mom, her precocious daughter, the mom's idealistic suitor, a judge on the tak e 
-- and most of Manhattan. (Rated PG)  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since the young are genetically programmed to prefer whatever is New and 
allegedly Improved, it's probably no surprise that they unanimously favored 
this update over the Christmas classic that won three Academy Awards 47 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 This time around, only a few principals (such as Attenborough who is British) 
speak with an upper-crust accent, child actors have learned how to be 
convincing, and most important, the movie is in regular color. "Colorized," 
apparently, just didn't cut it. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Ecclefield, 12, who came with his grandmother, said: "It was neat. It had 
the little girl from 'Mrs. Doubtfire' in it (Mara Wilson) and the guy from 
'Jurassic Park' (Attenborough). I liked those actors. They have that look that 
seemed to have a Christmas spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 Some kids thought Attenborough's spaced-out teeth made his Santa a little 
creepy, but Marc thought he looked great.  
</P>
<P>
 "They polished his nose to make it redder and shinier than in Jurassic Park." 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few kids were bothered by the film's indeterminate time period in which 
divorce is portrayed as a tragic aberration, bosses wear bow ties, and people 
train their children to call adults "Mr." and "Mrs."  
</P>
<P>
 Can we, for instance, really believe that a handsome, big-city single lawyer 
who arranges for a sitter before he asks a woman out and who buys a diamond for 
a woman he hasn't even kissed, has nowhere to go on holidays? I don't think so. 
Or that a high-powered female executive in a department store would let single 
guys she barely knows baby-sit her daughter, or wear weird generic suits to 
work? Or that there exist children who would ask Santa for only a bear or a 
doll? 
</P>
<P>
 Ooops, sorry. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, the new version seemed to provide kids with easier access to the 
timeless message of faith over reason, which was spelled out for them at least 
twice: "Santa Claus is a symbol of the human ability to suppress hateful and 
selfish tendencies that otherwise dominate our existence." 
</P>
<P>
 Like most kids, Marc said he liked the new version better because "it had 
color to it." Plus, he said, "it was a better story."  
</P>
<P>
 In this version, Kris Kringle is set up by evil department store rivals who 
taunt him until he fights back with his cane and is sent to a psychiatric ward. 
Some of the best-known scenes were deleted -- such as the dramatic courtroom 
climax where sacks of mail, addressed to Santa Claus, are dumped before the 
judge as legal proof that a branch of the U.S. government acknowledges the 
existence of Santa Claus. The kids said they didn't care, but you have to 
wonder if little ones will get the new explanation -- that the words "One 
nation under God" on a dollar bill signify official support for invisible 
beings. 
</P>
<P>
 Younger children seemed most impressed by the scenes of winter in New York. 
The little kid in back of me loved the Christmas tree in Rockefeller Plaza 
("Whoa!") was frightened by New York at night (who's not?) and had trouble 
suppressing doubts about the existence of snow. ("Who's throwing that snow? How 
do you know it's coming from the sky?") 
</P>
<P>
 The kid in front, obviously impressed by his first courtroom drama, couldn't 
stop yelling "Order! Order!" 
</P>
<P>
 But most older kids, believers and nonbelievers alike, appreciated the 
feel-good holiday message. 
</P>
<P>
 As believer Julia Gardner, 9, put it: "It's about children believing in Santa 
Claus and most adults don't."

SPECIAL SCREENING: EROTIC ABANDON KINDLES 'LOULOU' OF A ROMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lance writer who regularly 
covers theater for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Much of the interest in "Loulou," Maurice Pialat's 1980 movie about hard-nosed 
romance, comes from watching French stars Gerard Depardieu and Isabelle Huppert 
at earlier, less commercial plateaus in their careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pialat, a former painter known for the earnest realism of his films, tells the 
story of Nelly (Huppert) and Loulou (Depardieu), a pair of lovers who connect 
despite the disadvantage of having little in common besides a flash point of 
sexual attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Loulou" (screening Friday as the latest installment in UC Irvine's "Cinema 
Potpourri" series) shows what excited the French about Depardieu before he 
became better known to U.S. audiences in more mainstream pictures such as 
"Green Card." As Loulou (an ironic nickname for Louis), Depardieu is a street 
rowdy and thief with a huge heart and huger libido. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's not so much the lovable bear of "Green Card" as a rough symbol of 
low-class Parisian manhood in "Loulou." With his nervy insouciance, you get an 
impression of what provoked French critics to describe Depardieu as the most 
charismatic leading man since Jean Gabin. 
</P>
<P>
 And that brings us to Huppert, another favorite of French reviewers. She's the 
ice princess of European leading ladies, and her blankly emotional, somehow 
distant but also inviting style is ideal for Nelly, mired in a bourgeois life 
as the mistress of an advertising executive (Guy Marchand). 
</P>
<P>
 Everything seems routine but edgy until she meets the leather-jacketed, barely 
washed Loulou in a bar; then everything turns edgier but far from routine. They 
drop into an erotic abandon that echoes Bernardo Bertolucci's "Last Tango in 
Paris," although Pialat and cinematographers Pierre William Glenn and Jacques 
Loiseleux are less graphic in documenting Nelly and Loulou's 
burn-the-house-down passions. 
</P>
<P>
 The similarity is that they, like Marlon Brando and Maria Schneider's 
characters in "Tango," seek identity and truth, or at least a sweaty semblance 
of it, in their encounters. 
</P>
<P>
 Pialat's view is softer, though, as Loulou and Nelly, despite class 
differences and other more personal obstacles, fall genuinely in love. The 
director presents a very naturalistic romance that looks real, no matter how 
unlikely it may seem. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not all Pialat is after. Ultimately, he sticks to form, meaning his 
usual themes centering on young men and women at odds with French society at 
large. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, the self-absorbed and unambitious Loulou is asked what he wants 
to do and he replies, "Everything -- and nothing," proving that our own 
ambivalent Gen Xers aren't the first to embrace what's-the-point? slackerism.

SEAFOOD RULES IN THE EXHILARATING LAND OF SAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for the Times Orange County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A month ago we visited the world of Sam . . . Sam Woo Barbecue, that is -- a 
Chinese restaurant in Irvine that is packing in everyone from locals to 
visiting UCI professors. Now it's time to go next door, to the more formal -- 
and amazingly, even more frenetic -- Sam Woo Restaurant, where seafood is king. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday nights, Sam Woo is a madhouse. Enter the dining room through the 
crowded bar, and you'll probably bump into a waiter presenting a live lobster, 
wriggling inside a plastic bag, to a table of amazed guests. The back of the 
dining room has been reserved for aquariums, as crowded as the dining room 
itself but with channel cod, lobster, conch and other live seafoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The dining room is disarmingly unadorned, a long, white-ceilinged room 
dominated by center columns housing back-lit glass showcases. Inside are 
Chinese objets d'art in pottery and cloisonne. The four Chinese characters that 
spell Sam Woo Restaurant are displayed on a side wall in black-on-white brush 
strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sam Woo chain started in Monterey Park and has expanded to more than 13 
locations. It has done so by using a simple Cantonese formula: the freshest 
ingredients possible, cooked in an utterly simple manner. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two menus: the regular, 173-item menu, which is seafoods from No. 1 
all the way up to No. 98, and a smaller, gold-colored menu card. The latter 
lists 33 Chinese delicacies, and don't overlook it. It contains some of the 
best dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 A good starting point for a Chinese feast might be the poetically named 
peacock blossom platter, an artfully arranged mound of superb meats from Sam 
Woo Barbecue next door. Of course, you'll have to sift through the landlubber 
protein on this platter if you want get to the seafoods. Things like five-spice 
roast duck, roast suckling pig and sweet-edged strips of barbecued pork might 
very well catch your eye before you get to the chewy, orange-tinted cuttlefish, 
a cousin of squid. 
</P>
<P>
 After the barbecue, I suggest a wonderful appetizer called vegetable roll. 
You'll have to ask your waiter for it, because it is not listed on either menu. 
The people of Shanghai call this dish mock goose because of the skin-like sheet 
of dried bean curd that holds it together -- it's long, white and wrinkled, 
like a goose neck. The filling is julienne bamboo and carrot, laced with bits 
of tree ear and black mushroom. This is one of the glories of Chinese 
vegetarian cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 Now you might want to try a soup, such as the tangy Westlake beef soup, the 
simple and satisfying winter melon soup or, from the gold menu, the 
exhilarating steamed chicken and ginseng soup. This last could be called Jewish 
penicillin with an added kick: a steaming caldron of rich chicken broth 
containing chicken meat, a few chives and some slices of the bittersweet 
ginseng root, said to heat the body and infuse it with bright yang energy. 
</P>
<P>
 Minced shrimp with lettuce, also from the gold menu, makes a fine intermediate 
course that will tantalize your appetite without overwhelming it. The dish is a 
twist on the better-known lettuce-wrapped squab (or chicken), where the minced 
meat, smeared with plum sauce, is served in lettuce leaf cups. It provides an 
intriguing textural contrast of crisp water chestnuts, plump pine nuts, 
chopped-up shrimp and stringy, full-flavored bamboo. The idea is to pick it up 
and eat it like a burrito (good luck). 
</P>
<P>
 On to the real meat and potatoes of this restaurant . . . or should we say, 
fish and vegetables. Live lobster is a bargain at only $8.75 a pound, though 
I'd go for more exotic seafoods, perhaps the tender sauteed conch with green 
onion, or even the restaurant's exemplary spicy salted squid. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone not on a budget should consider the incredible channel cod, a 
red-skinned beauty of a fish, steamed and sprinkled with a flurry of green 
onion and ginger. Taste this delicate, sweet-fleshed fish and you'll wonder why 
anyone would even consider cooking fresh fish any other way than steaming. It's 
a big ticket item -- $47.90 for a four-pound fish -- but exemplifies how good 
Chinese cooking can be. 
</P>
<P>
 Another great dish is hearts of baby bok choy, sauteed simply with garlic and 
oil. The vegetable, with its tiny green center leaves, is astonishing.  
</P>
<P>
 Not everything works on this level. The vaunted bamboo pith, the spongy center 
portion of a bamboo shoot, absorbs too much oil when cooking and is upstaged by 
the humble mustard greens it is served with. Cross ribs with orange sauce turns 
out to be a sugary mess, good meat ruined by a sticky, insipid sauce. The baked 
clams with mint have an oddly medicinal taste, and the house braised duck is 
greasy. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, for every dish like those, there seem to be three good ones. Lamb 
hot pot (from the gold menu, again) is full of good chunky lamb and tender 
dried bean curd, which absorbs the gamy meat flavors beautifully. Spicy salt 
pork chop, a northern Chinese classic, is properly crunchy and golden brown. 
Even the rice dishes are worth a visit. Salted fish and chicken fried rice is a 
step up from the mundane fried rice dishes of more Americanized Chinese 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Who would have imagined it? Irvine, the new center of the world of Sam. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Woo Restaurant is moderate to expensive. Appetizers are $2.50 to $30. 
Soups are $4.50 to $10. Main dishes begin at $7.95. Live seafoods are sold by 
weight, at market prices.

 Turkey, again?  
</P>
<P>
 Yes and no. It's been several centuries since serving turkey with New World 
foods became a Thanksgiving tradition, and over time Americans have discovered 
that there's more than one way to stuff a bird, and themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 There's tandoori turkey, for instance. At the Clay Oven and Bombay Duck 
restaurants, turkeys are skinned, trimmed of fat, marinated in yogurt, herbs 
and spices for a day or two, stuffed with basmati , vegetables and nuts, cooked 
over mesquite in a tandoor oven and served with cranberry chutney. The turkeys 
weigh eight to 10 pounds, serve four to six, can be picked up on Thanksgiving 
Day or the day before, and cost $39.95. 
</P>
<P>
 A "Native American Thanksgiving Feast" at Topaz Cafe includes a native salad 
with avocado and appaloosa beans; roast turkey with pine nut, sage and corn 
bread stuffing; maple, bourbon and clove-studded ham with sour mango sauce; 
potlach smoked and oven-baked salmon with cilantro pesto and corn salsa; 
four-berry trifle, and chocolate bread pudding. The buffet will be served on 
the holiday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. It's $13.95 a person; $5.95 for children 
under 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's version of the holiday, "A Disney First Thanksgiving," is set in a 
pumpkin patch. An all-you-can-eat buffet is only one of the draws; others 
include chipmunks Chip 'n' Dale in Native American dress, Pilgrim Goofy, Three 
Little Pigs, the Big Bad Wolf and continuous musical entertainment. It takes 
place from noon to 7 p.m. at the Disneyland Hotel. Adults, $35.50; children 3 
to 11, $12.50; under 3, $3. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Brisas will serve Thanksgiving fare for the first time in its 15-year 
history. Choice of soups ($3.95) include a creamy roasted butternut squash soup 
in a strudel bowl. Among appetizers ($6 to $7.25) is a duck tamale with Indian 
corn and pomegranate sauce. Half a dozen entrees ($16.25 to $21) include turkey 
with jalapeno corn bread stuffing and cranberry-orange relish. Dinner served 
from 2 to 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Those on more of a budget might head for PoFolks, and what seems to be an 
amazing Thanksgiving Day bargain: an all-you-can-eat ham or turkey dinner with 
corn bread stuffing and giblet gravy, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes, green 
beans, biscuits and pumpkin pie for $7.99. For kids under 10, a turkey meal is 
$2.99. The restaurant specializes in hearty portions and Southern-style 
cooking; this offer runs 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 RUFF! Turkey's usually not good for dogs, but it can be if people are eating 
it. Every penny from a roast turkey dinner served from noon till 4 p.m. at 
Tivoli Terrace, including tips for volunteer waiters, will be turned over to 
RUFF, which stands for Rescuing Unwanted Furry Friends and the support arm for 
the Laguna Beach Animal Shelter. The meal includes salad, stuffing, sweet 
potatoes and pumpkin pie; wine is additional. Adults, $15; children ages 12 and 
under, $7.50. For those who love animals and don't eat them, vegetarian fare is 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 Vegetarian fare is all you'll find at Last Mango in Newport, so complementing 
traditional mashed potatoes, baked glazed yams and cranberry sauce will be a 
gluten-based mock turkey and brown almond nut roast. The meal is served from 
11:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; $13.95 includes pumpkin or apple pie and beverages. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the true spirit of Thanksgiving: La Casa Garcia hopes to serve 10,000 
turkeys to those who are alone or unable to cook, or who simply need a way to 
feed their families a holiday dinner. Phone the restaurant if you can help with 
the loan of tables or chairs or donation of turkeys, milk, butter -- 200 pounds 
of butter are needed -- fruit, vegetables or pumpkin pies. Financial 
contributions help pay for food. Dinner is served from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. in the 
parking lot.

TRIED & TRUE; IT'S ALL BIG GAME: DINING ON LION, PEACOCKS, GATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 I'd been waiting years to use the line, and now I had my chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll have the alligator," I said to the waiter, "and make it snappy!" 
</P>
<P>
 The occasion was the recent ninth annual Festival of the Hunt at Aurora 
Restaurant in Fullerton. For three days, one could sample such exotic fare as 
North Pole musk ox, lion, rattlesnake, kangaroo, peacock, ostrich, Rocky 
Mountain oysters and a game fish from the Amazon called pirarucu -- more than 
two dozen wild things in all. 
</P>
<P>
 Greeting my wife, Kathleen, and me at the door were the sight of a stuffed 
grizzly bear and ostrich and the sounds of a yodeling accordionist; near a 
signed photo of Buddy Ebsen stood a musk ox, and, in fact, the whole restaurant 
was filled with stuffed animals provided by Bob's Taxidermy for the event. 
</P>
<P>
 It reminded me of those Japanese restaurants that display food in the front 
window to help you decide what to order. Opposite our table were a peacock and 
a bush pig. We imagined the head directly over my head to be that of a hyena, 
but chef Leo Holczer determined it was a kind of fox. An alligator, jaws agape, 
hovered over the next table. 
</P>
<P>
 Our jaws were similarly agape at the menu possibilities. Prices ranged from 
$4.50 for wild game consomme to $38 for moose loin; Holczer invited us to 
sample some of the more unusual items. Many of the entrees were served with 
potato William -- in the shape of a pear -- or spatzle, German noodle 
dumplings. 
</P>
<P>
 The aforementioned request for alligator was satisfied. Our appetizers also 
included rattlesnake on angel hair pasta and Rocky Mountain oysters remoulade. 
Alligator was tame and unassuming; rattlesnake on angel hair pasta proved more 
assertive, like slightly smoky veal. "Mmmmm," said Kathleen. "Good snake." 
</P>
<P>
 Rocky Mountain oysters had been pounded flat ("hopefully afterward," Kathleen 
noted). The mere sight of the oysters, a.k.a. bull testicles, in the shape of a 
pancake was enough to make one member of the male persuasion wince. Beneath the 
fried exterior the flavor resembled, appropriately, organ meats, such as 
brains. Food for thought. 
</P>
<P>
 The Amazon fish called pirarucu found its way to our shores this year; fileted 
thin and grilled, it was firm like a sea bass but more intensely flavored. 
Ostrich seemed the minute-steak of birds, a one-dimensional affair, but who 
cared given that Cognac plum sauce? Kangaroo rack chop was like a very 
delicate, very tender version of lamb chops. 
</P>
<P>
 We'd hopped at the chance to try kangaroo and had raced to sample ostrich. But 
we were more reluctant when it came to sampling lion -- you can't hide your 
head in the sand about some issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not after those (TV) specials!" said my wife. We'd recently watched several 
documentaries about the noble creatures, and she's got a thing for cats anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Holczer admitted that roast African lion is not a popular item. "For me, it is 
a mistake to serve lion," he said. "People are intrigued, but they always have 
reservations." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, who's about to take a bite of Simba? 
</P>
<P>
 I was. I swallowed my own reservations along with a forkful of the king of 
beasts, and it tasted like . . . like . . . chicken! Just kidding. In fact, 
nothing could be further from the truth. It had a beguiling bitterness and 
marvelous complexity not found in beef and somehow tasted just as you'd imagine 
cat might taste. 
</P>
<P>
 I roared my approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen took a bite. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could eat that," she agreed enthusiastically. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Holczer, all the animals served, including lion, are hunted in 
strict accordance with conservation guidelines, and usually on specifically 
designated game ranches. And anyway, he pointed out, eating game animals is "as 
old as man." 
</P>
<P>
 "Early man was eating and wearing anything he could," Holczer said. "You're 
eating a game animal, or you're eating a cow or a chicken; what's the 
difference? It's an animal. Here at least we look for the unusual. Otherwise 
it's a McDonald's on every corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the way," he added as he headed back toward the kitchen, "the first man 
who tried chicken, he said it tastes like what -- rattlesnake?" 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these animals taste the way they look.  
</P>
<P>
 North Pole musk ox proved a woolly affair, like an ox with mutton overtones. 
</P>
<P>
 Peacock was a morsel of kaleidoscopic splendor. It was the color and texture 
of turkey but offered an infinitely more intriguing array of earth and herbal 
flavors -- a real eye-opener. It was also an eye-opener to be eating peacock 
while one was staring right at you. 
</P>
<P>
 The special game pfeffer -- a stew -- incorporated lion, moose, boar, antelope 
and musk ox, and it became a game to pick them out. 
</P>
<P>
 We didn't try hare, buffalo, caribou or a host of game birds including grouse 
and wild turkey. Some we'd had before; others didn't seem all that exotic in 
this company. 
</P>
<P>
 But our horizons had expanded for sure. Turkey is bland contrasted with 
peacock, beef is bland contrasted with lion. And in fall or winter, at least, 
we'd probably choose a game dish over almost any other. 
</P>
<P>
 With one exception, I discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing compares with chicken," Kathleen said. "Chicken is so . . . chicken 
." 
</P>
<P>
 Half a dozen dishes, including alligator, venison and elk, remain on the menu 
through fall and winter; these range from $10 to $25. (Pastas can be paired 
with a variety of preparations, and theoretically, at least, you can have 
alligator gnocchi.) Holczer will serve some of the more unusual meats and game 
birds as revolving specials. Call ahead to see what's on the board.

PARKER'S PLACE: IN THE BATTLE OF BODY VS. TIME, A NEW CHAMP

<P>
 I love boxing because it is a nearly uncompromisable contest: two men, four 
gloves and a stage. No rubber balls, no teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Our interest in this spectacle springs from an ancient place inside us, the 
same odd corner of mind that remains fascinated with fire and thirsty for 
legend. The sport is primitive, succinct and dramatic. It is designed to be 
both triumphant and tragic, and occasionally it is. 
</P>
<P>
 I love boxing because it is such a concentrated display of skill and 
willpower. In few other sports -- maybe running and wrestling -- are the mind 
and body so intensely bound together for so long. The goal is simple but large: 
better the man in front of you. In a good match, every cell in the two 
contestants' minds and bodies is fully engaged and fully challenged. Sometimes, 
the winner has accomplished something that only his ego has allowed him to 
believe is possible. For all its pain and tragedy, boxing can be transcendent. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything about a fighter is on the line, in the open, offered up. He brings 
his history into the ring, and will have to reveal it to you. He brings his 
character, or lack of character, knowing his opponent will test it and you will 
perceive its qualities with resounding clarity. He brings his fears and dreams. 
He brings his entire portfolio of skills and tactics. He brings the sum total 
of himself, and what he believes he might be. 
</P>
<P>
 It is no surprise that so many fighters pray to their god before and after a 
fight. This is because they have brought something into the ring that is 
precious, unique and irreplaceable: their lives. Few athletes can make such a 
claim, and no spectator can ask for a higher stake, because there isn't one. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which can be a little easy to forget on a Saturday fight night at my 
place, when the guys arrive with food and booze and those male attitudes of 
abandon that accompany the ditching of wives and girlfriends to watch fights. 
It's geared to be a festive time, and it usually is. If the upcoming bout is 
interesting enough, all talk will be related to it. If not, it's fishing and 
surfing yarns, tales of job horrors, interrogations about who's got a romance 
starting and who's got one ending. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, we met to watch George Foreman and Michael Moorer in a 
heavyweight championship bout. As of fight time, the odds were 2-1 in favor of 
Moorer, the undefeated, 26-year-old champion who had pounded out a quiet but 
convincing win over Evander Holyfield seven months earlier to claim what many 
regard as the most coveted crown in sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman -- who ruled as heavyweight champion in October of 1974 (yes, two full 
decades ago) when Muhammad Ali knocked him out -- came into the ring at a 
relatively trim 250 pounds. More interestingly, his attitude was subdued and 
somber, the big crease lines in his forehead furrowing down over deep-set, 
introspective eyes. Gone was George's strange little grin, his twinkle, his 
good-natured lethargy before a bout. Depending on your own psychology, you 
could interpret this as deep concentration or profound fear. 
</P>
<P>
 He lumbered into the ring in a simple robe and sweats, a mammoth Kurtz taking 
-- most thought -- his farewell excursion up river. Moorer entered at a 
fat-free 222. Fighters are as hard to read before a match as a poker player 
after a draw, but Moorer might be the hardest of all. His body language was 
relaxed but poised, his eyes, set like little jewels beneath the ponderous dome 
of his head, looked focused and calm. When he met Foreman center ring, he 
stared at the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's where he's gonna end up," somebody in our group said. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, he knows he'll win." 
</P>
<P>
 And so on. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the fight, much had been made of Foreman's age. He claims to be 45, 
though some insiders say he's older. He was not only lugging around nearly five 
decades of life, but a 72-4 record in body-racking professional fights, some 
against the best heavyweights the world has produced in the last 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman has grappled with bankruptcy of the finances as well as spirit. He's a 
man whose willpower has always been in question, a man gone from thug to boxer 
to preacher to boxer again. To many, he appeared not so much a contender as a 
stuffed container of human experience poorly suited to withstand the assault of 
a younger, leaner, less troubled soul. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the second round, everyone in the room was concentrating wholly 
on the fight -- a rarity. Everyone was also scoring the fight -- in 10 years of 
fight parties I've never seen score cards on every person's lap. The spectacle 
had drawn us in and occupied us. We understood that we were witnessing a 
terrible, wonderful contest. Two things seemed obvious: Moorer could win, and 
Foreman could win. 
</P>
<P>
 It was close. Because of the spectacular ending, little was said about the 
body of the fight. But it was one of the very finest 10 rounds in heavyweight 
history. The punching was crisp, calculated, effective. There was not a single 
clinch in the entire bout. Neither fighter rested against the ropes, even for 
an instant. There were no low blows, no warnings from the referees, no punches 
after the bell, no show-boating, no taunting. In fact, referee Joe Cortez 
seemed to simply vanish into the lights of the MGM Grand, only to materialize 
10 rounds later to count out a fully defeated Michael Moorer. Only a handful of 
times have I seen better pure boxing, in any division. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, 10 rounds of superb boxing meant little compared to the outcome. 
The explosion in my house was riotous when Moorer went down, then became 
scarcely containable as he was counted out. The walls shook with our bellowing 
and clapping, the stamping of our feet, the fists-raised victory jigs followed 
by screams of pure, raucous joy. The windows shook and the floor rumbled. The 
dogs slinked away, ceding us humans the title of most primitive, most 
dangerous. My Labrador looked at me as though he feared we were about to grill 
and eat him. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly strangely, though, everyone in the room hugged when Moorer was counted 
out. I can't explain this, other than to say that Foreman had somehow shown us 
all what willpower could do. He had demonstrated for us regular, fortysomething 
guys the art of the possible. When I looked at the screen, Foreman was down on 
his knees in a neutral corner, giving thanks.

3-HOUR TOUR: DUCK! STROLL THROUGH MARSH TAKES FOWL TURN

<P>
 Ducks hang out in salt marshes, salty dogs hang out in a museum, and an 
assault from Team Caffeine keeps landlubbers sailing along the county's 
northwest coast. 
</P>
<P>
 8 to 8:20 a.m.: Cappuccino-To-Go-Go claims to be the county's first 
drive-through espresso bar; the "NOW OPEN" sign is misleading, since it opened 
three years ago. Gourmet coffee is $1, espresso $1.50 and cappuccino $2; all 
drinks are served with double shots, and tax is included. Hot chocolate and 
decaffeinated coffee are also available. Bagels are $1.25 and assorted pastries 
range from $1.25 to $2.50. 
</P>
<P>
 I went for the Depth Charge, made of two shots of espresso and regular or 
flavored coffee ($1.75); within moments, all guns were firing. 
</P>
<P>
 8:20 to 10:20: At Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve, executive director Phil 
Smith and I spotted American avocets, house sparrows, rock doves (pigeon), 
starlings, half a dozen snowy egrets and several great egrets -- the great 
egrets have a yellow bill and black feet, Smith pointed out, the snowy egrets 
have a black bill and yellow feet -- five species of tern and a whole herd of 
dunlins. ("Uh, flock -- we call 'em flocks, " Smith said.)  
</P>
<P>
 And that was just in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 A hundred years ago, a creek flowed from what is now Westminster into the 
ocean. In 1899, the Bolsa Chica Gun Club built a dam with tide gates across the 
creek for duck-hunting purposes, and the lowlands began to dry. Around 1940 
came oil production, and wells still pump there. In 1978, the tide gate was 
opened and seawater again poured into the wetland. The reserve now totals 530 
acres, 200 of which are restored salt marsh. 
</P>
<P>
 Ducks were seen in the millions around 1825; there were reports of skies dark 
with flocks of waterfowl. The area around the reserve remains controversial; 
developers would like to build houses on the mesa and in the lowlands. For now, 
the five habitat zones are sub-tidal, inner tidal, marsh, uplands and salt 
pans. A swamp would have trees; instead, we saw beached ulva -- sea lettuce -- 
and three kinds of pickleweed, which are succulents shaped like teeny-tiny 
pickles. 
</P>
<P>
 The water is clear enough to see an abundance of horse mussels and horn 
snails, which Smith likened to little brown ice-cream cones without the ice 
cream. "We get them by the gazillions," he noted. The incredible Mr. Limpet 
takes his name from a tenacious mollusk that you can see attached to rocks. You 
might also spot round stingrays, which look like frying pans, and tan-speckled 
sea hares the size of footballs; sightings of smoothhound sharks are not 
uncommon near the tide gate. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike brown pelicans, far less common white pelicans cooperate when they 
fish, lining up abreast and herding fish before gobbling them up. We saw six 
doing just that. Busy taking photos, regular visitor Peter Knapp recalled 
seeing 150 white pelicans on one amazing day and believes that right now is one 
of the best times of year at the reserve. The return of the terns in spring is 
also very exciting, he said. In the meantime, a pair of peregrine falcons 
proved exciting enough. 
</P>

 10:20 to 11: King Neptune's Nautical Museum and Restaurant is a quirky place, 
to say the least. Out front is a yellow and blue tugboat called Queen Neptune. 
In the front window is a life-size scene from "Mutiny on the Bounty," with 
Marlon Brando and Trevor Howard mannequins -- which is which is anybody's 
guess. A sidewalk of fame featuring the hand-scrawled names of Miss USAs, 
Internationals and Universes dating back to 1953 borders the building. A 
dolphin flies over the roof.  
</P>
<P>
 On the walls inside are a World War II article about 1,900 sailors being 
recruited for anti-VD research, Coast Guard guidelines "for the use of gun and 
rocket apparatus for saving lives from shipwreck," and a copy of the decree 
instructing all county residents of Japanese descent to "evacuate." In glass 
cases are intricately carved scrimshaw, metal from the wreck of the battleship 
Maine (destroyed near Havana in 1898) and a quarterpike from the frigate 
Constitution circa 1797. 
</P>
<P>
 Whole walls are covered with battleship plaques, vintage telescopes, 
binoculars, pistols, knives and swords, and lobsters. There are also several 
female figureheads, a massaging health chair, a piece of the Berlin Wall, an 
arm hanging out of a shark's mouth overhead and a stuffed beaver on the bar. 
The kitchen isn't open till 5 p.m., but complimentary soup's out when the doors 
open, a welcome respite after a wintry morning in the wetlands.

FLEISS' LAWYERS LOSE BID TO ARGUE CLIENT ISSUE; COURT: ISSUE OF WHY POLICE DID 
NOT CHARGE CUSTOMERS OF ALLEGED HOLLYWOOD MADAM IS NOT WORTH THE TIME, JUDGE 
SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge ruled Wednesday that Heidi Fleiss' defense attorneys cannot raise 
arguments about why the alleged Hollywood madam's clients were not charged by 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning ruling by Superior Court Judge Judith Champagne came in response 
to a bid by Fleiss' lawyers to show that their client was the victim of 
selective prosecution. The attorneys said Tuesday that the names of Fleiss' 
clients were revealed in earlier grand jury testimony, raising the possibility 
that the customers would be identified in court. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorneys hoped to argue that even after customers were identified, police 
did not pursue them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find that any relevance to be derived from the enormous amount of time that 
would be involved in presenting all of this (evidence) is so limited that I am 
not going to allow that to be presented to the jury," Champagne said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, jurors watching a police videotape saw four young women walk into 
a Beverly Hills hotel suite on a summer night, allegedly sent there by Fleiss, 
for sex with undercover police officers for a price. 
</P>
<P>
 The four alleged prostitutes were secretly videotaped in a police sting that 
led to Fleiss' arrest last year for pandering and narcotics violations, a 
prosecutor told jurors Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The women were arrested after they described to the four undercover officers 
what sexual services they would perform for $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of officers swarmed into the room as the women began to undress, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Alan Carter said. The women, identified as Samantha 
Burdette, Peggy Schinke, Brandi McClain and Kimberly Burch, were not charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss is charged with procuring them for prostitution in the case, which 
resumes testimony today. 
</P>
<P>
 Sammy Lee, a Beverly Hills police detective spearheading the sting, posed as a 
Hawaiian businessman who hired the women to "entertain" three Asian business 
colleagues, who were actually undercover operatives from the Los Angeles Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the four women arrived at the Beverly Hilton Hotel last year, Lee 
said, he took each of them into the suite's bedroom with one other undercover 
officer. He then told jurors what transpired. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each officer asked the young lady basically for $1,500 what would they get," 
Lee said under questioning from prosecutor Carter. "The answers ranged from 
straight sex to oral sex to what they wouldn't do" for that price, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Anthony Brooklier established in questioning that all the 
women were asked by the undercover agents to consent to anal sex and all 
refused. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you want to see how far you could go with this?" Brooklier asked Lee in 
one of the day's testiest exchanges. He said that when the women consented to 
straight and oral sex for money they already had gone far enough to be charged, 
and the additional sexual request was "sordid." 
</P>
<P>
 "It really was for the totality of the act," Lee said. "We would rather have a 
lot of ducks versus one duck. And that is strictly for presenting the case to 
the district attorney." 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the day, Brooklier asked Lee if he knew the four women in 
earlier grand jury questioning had named some of their clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know the names of these customers?" Brooklier asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter objected, saying the customers' names -- one of Hollywood's biggest 
secrets -- were irrelevant to the case. Champagne suspended questioning, 
setting the stage for today's ruling on the objection. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, Brooklier is attempting to show that Fleiss is the victim 
of selective prosecution, and that the police never pursue a prostitute's 
clients, even when they know who they are. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Fleiss ran a sophisticated operation catering to the rich and 
famous, and her clients are said to include Hollywood and business leaders.

KOREAN GROUPS BACK UNION FIGHT FOR JOBS; LABOR: A COALITION IS PRESSING THE 
L.A. HILTON'S OWNER NOT TO LET A MANAGEMENT FIRM FIRE HOTEL WORKERS, MOST OF 
WHOM ARE LATINOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By K. CONNIE KANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A coalition of Korean American organizations has come to the aid of union 
workers, predominantly Latinos, who could lose their jobs if the owner of the 
Downtown Los Angeles Hilton & Towers changes management firms. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition is exerting pressure on the South Korean owner of the hotel not 
only because "it is the morally correct thing to do, but because (the 
company's) decision can have a negative impact on the local Korean American 
community," said Paul S. Lee, a community organizer with Korean Immigrant 
Workers Advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of who takes over the management of the hotel, owned by Hanjin 
International Corp., the union contracts should be honored "out of sense of 
justice and dignity" for hundreds of loyal employees, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month 575 hotel workers, including those in housekeeping and the kitchen, 
were notified that their employment would be terminated Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason, according to the notice from the hotel's general manager, is the 
Dec. 31 expiration of the contract between Hanjin and the Hilton Hotels Corp., 
which has managed the facility since Hanjin acquired it in 1989. Hanjin is a 
subsidiary of one of South Korea's biggest conglomerates, which also owns 
Korean Air. 
</P>
<P>
 A Hanjin spokesman said it is premature for workers to worry about losing 
their jobs because the company and the Hilton are trying to work out an 
agreement. He said that the management contract has been extended through Jan. 
31 while the two sides continue their talks. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday about two dozen hotel workers, union representatives and their 
supporters went to City Hall to talk with council members who are expected to 
adopt a resolution urging Hanjin to retain the hotel employees at their current 
positions and wages, which range from $7 to $10 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The involvement of the Korean company in a dispute involving mostly Latino 
workers set off alarms among Korean American activists who have been 
concentrating on improving relations with other ethnic groups since the Los 
Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We became concerned that the situation could turn into a racial issue, and 
negatively impact our community," said Roy Hong, executive director of Korean 
Immigrant Workers Advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong was instrumental in enlisting the support of other Korean American 
organizations. His group and the Korean American Inter-Agency Council, a 
consortium of nine organizations, have participated in news conferences and 
other events publicizing the case. Last Saturday union members and their 
supporters demonstrated in front of the Korean Air terminal at Los Angeles 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Skurnik, campaign coordinator for the Hotel Employees & Restaurant 
Employees Local 11, said Hanjin officials should not even consider terminating 
the employees. "Don't they know that workers in this city will not put up with 
that? Hilton workers fought for (their) jobs and benefits," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Grossman, a Hanjin spokesman, said the company has gone out of its way 
to be accommodating to the hotel employees. To alleviate the fears of workers, 
he said, Hanjin sent out a memo informing workers that in the event the 
management contract with Hilton is not renewed, Hanjin plans to "rehire all or 
substantially all" of the current employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Grossman said, even though the company is not legally obligated, 
it has agreed to recognize all five unions involved. 
</P>
<P>
 But Maria Elena Durazo, president of the Local 11, who enlisted the help of 
the local Korean organizations, said she wants promises from the company in 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanjin's Oct. 28 notice states that employees would be "subject to an 
application and interview process and . . . a brief introductory period." 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Pierson, a bell captain who has worked 25 years at the Hilton, said, "I 
don't like their attitude; they're treating us like chattel." 
</P>
<P>
 Pierson, 62, says he plans to retire next year, but he will fight to prevent 
hardships to those trying to retain their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Felisa Quisora, a houskeeper at the Hilton, said she was "so sad" when she got 
the termination notice. "After working so hard for all these years -- we don't 
deserve this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, when the Koreana Co. of South Korea bought the former Hyatt 
Wilshire Hotel and fired 150 union employees, Local 11 joined the Asian Pacific 
American Labor Alliance and other Asian community groups in fighting the 
company. Union members picketed the hotel for almost a year before the 
dismissed workers were rehired. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest coalition is the first significant effort by Korean American 
community organizations to create a multiethnic coalition to support workers.r 
Durazo called the commitment of the Korean American groups a "wonderful 
example" of coalition building between Latinos and Koreans. "It just goes to 
show you it doesn't matter what your language or nationality is," she said. 
"People will come forward and support what is right."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA MONICA; 
WHITEWATER FIGURE TO BE TRIED FOR EMBEZZLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Susan McDougal, who with her ex-husband was a partner in the failed Whitewater 
investment deal that has dogged President Clinton, was ordered Monday to stand 
trial in Santa Monica on charges of embezzling more than $150,000 from 
conductor Zubin Mehta and his wife, Nancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty.Jeffrey Semow said the seven felony counts stem from forged 
checks and unauthorized credit card purchases made during three years when 
Susan McDougal was Nancy Mehta's personal assistant and bookkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 The irregularities came to light in 1992 when a bank called Nancy Mehta for 
permission to exceed a credit card's $10,000 limit -- a card Mehta said she 
never knew existed, Semow said.  
</P>
<P>
 McDougal's attorney said his client is innocent because she had full authority 
from Nancy Mehta for the disputed expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 "All expenses were for the Mehtas' benefit and are with their approval," 
attorney Leonard Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal is free on $20,000 bail.

AGOURA'S DRISCOLL GOOD AS HIS WORD, 14-12 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Agoura High's Chris Driscoll knew how to ease the mind of a concerned coach -- 
he guaranteed a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 And Driscoll delivered Wednesday when he scored four goals, including two in 
overtime, that gave the Chargers a 14-12 victory over San Luis Obispo in a 
Southern Section Division IV quarterfinal water polo match. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura Coach Jason Rosenthal was upset Tuesday over San Luis Obispo's protest 
that the depth of Agoura's pool is only six feet -- six inches short of 
regulation for a playoff game. It forced the Chargers to overfill the pool so 
the game would not be moved. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Rosenthal) was upset about the pool thing and that was reflecting on us," 
Driscoll said, "so I just said, 'Don't worry, I'll guarantee a victory.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't come easily for the Chargers (20-4), who trailed by three goals with 
five minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 After Agoura pulled to within 11-10, the Tigers' best player, Chris Lund, was 
ejected for throwing a punch with 1:29 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura's David Arons scored with 1:01 to play, tying the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Powers scored to give San Luis Obispo a 12-11 lead with 19 seconds to 
play, but Joey Vona scored on a pass from Driscoll with 10 seconds left, 
sending the game to a three-minute overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers will face top-ranked San Marcos on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Driscoll who has 200 goals, broke the school record of 196. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal 18, Cabrillo 10 -- Bill Bruininga scored four goals to lead the 
Highlanders in a Division IV quarterfinal match at Rancho Simi Community Pool. 
Royal will face second-seeded Santa Barbara in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Kris Kunkel, Matt Landre and Randy Owens each scored three goals for the 
Highlanders (16-11) and Randy Zielinski had 14 saves.

 U.S. Oil Demand Up 4.1% in October: The American Petroleum Institute said 
total deliveries of oil products -- a key measure of demand -- averaged 18.032 
million barrels a day, an increase of 709,000 barrels a day, or 4.1%, over the 
average set in October, 1993. As the economy grew last month, people drove 
more, companies put more cars and trucks on the road, and gasoline deliveries 
rose to an average of 7.877 million barrels a day. Another reason for the extra 
gasoline use: pent-up demand after a relatively slack month in September.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; BOND YIELDS SURGE; BLUE CHIPS UP SOLIDLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long-term bond yields surged Wednesday as investors found little reassurance 
in the news of unexpectedly tame inflation last month. Blue-chip stocks racked 
up solid gains. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the Treasury's key 30-year bond rose to 8.09% from Tuesday's 
8.03%. Its price, which falls when yields rise, dropped 22/32 point, or $6.88 
per $1,000 in face value. Prices of shorter-term maturities posted smaller 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue-chip stocks posted moderate gains for most of the session until a late 
burst of trading propelled it decisively higher. The Dow Jones industrial 
average gained 18.84 points to close at 3,845.20.  
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department reported that consumer prices rose just 0.1% in October, 
the best inflation performance in six months. Many analysts had expected an 
increase matching the 0.2% rise in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called core rate, which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors, 
was also tame in October, rising just 0.2% for the second month in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond prices initially shot higher after Wednesday's good news on inflation, 
which over a bond's life can eat away at the value of the preset interest 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the day wore on, investors apparently decided that October inflation 
was old news.  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike bond traders, stock investors were buoyed partly by the consumer price 
index report. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said investors were also shopping for a few select stocks among blue 
chips. 
</P>
<P>
 But as investors picked at stocks, analysts said the market as a whole was 
unsettled by bonds' inability to add to Tuesday's rally, which was sparked by 
the Federal Reserve Board's interest rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock investors don't like higher rates because they raise corporate costs, 
which cut into earnings and stock valuations, and they make bonds more 
attractive relative to equities. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 7 to 6 
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 296.99 million shares, 
down from 339.91 million on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad market indexes were generally higher. The NYSE's composite index rose 
0.19 point to 254.71. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.57 point to 
465.60, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 0.62 point to 769.64. At the 
American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 0.22 point to 448.39. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the dollar weakened as foreign-exchange traders took profits from a 
surge the previous day, when the currency derived strength from the Fed's 
sharper-than-expected rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar closed at 1.551 German marks and 98.35 Japanese yen, 
down from 1.556 and 98.76, respectively, on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Financial stocks also lost ground in the face of higher interest rates. 
Morgan Stanley fell 1 to 61 7/8 after reporting a 35% drop in its third-quarter 
profit. 
</P>

BAZAAR? YES, AND IT'S A WAY TO SHARE CHRISTMAS WITH THE TRULY NEEDY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 SANTA'S HELPERS: If Rwandan refugees seem more needy this Christmas than does 
Uncle Elmer's tie collection, then the Bethlehem Bazaar may be your kind of 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, if you're inclined to buy a family of piglets for fledgling 
ranchers in Colombia or coffee plants for an aspiring farmer in Nicaragua, the 
mall probably can't help you. Purchases such as these are made at the bazaar, 
sponsored by Rolling Hills Covenant Church, and shipped to the needy in the 
United States and in Third World countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is simple: Instead of buying more stuff for people who already have 
too much stuff, shoppers can fill a few basic needs for the underprivileged 
millions. 
</P>
<P>
 Gift-buyers are encouraged to do their holiday shopping at the bazaar, then 
send cards to friends and family letting them know their gifts ended up in, 
say, Bangladesh. 
</P>
<P>
 The church, at 2222 Palos Verdes Drive North, will conduct the bazaar from 
4:30 to 8:30 p.m. Saturday and 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Sunday. It is free. 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois-based World Relief plans to back 22 such bazaars this year as a way 
for participants to "rediscover the real meaning and joy of Christmas," as 
church spokeswoman Kathleen Smith put it. The bazaar is decorated to emulate a 
biblical-era marketplace, with workers dressed in the fashion of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people have a hard time in malls finding a gift that their cousin, 
nephew or dad really needs," Smith said. "But these gifts are desperately 
needed and greatly appreciated. And it also gets your Christmas shopping done 
early." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 BULLETPROOF BOBBIES -- Torrance Police Department's bulletproof vests -- its 
used ones, that is -- will soon have about 100 London bobbies breathing a 
little easier. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance has joined a nationwide effort to ship its vests to the U.K. after an 
Internet conversation between a Scottish detective and a Las Vegas lieutenant 
prompted the idea. Torrance Officer Devin Chase learned of an ensuing effort to 
collect vests and got Torrance involved, Torrance Sgt. Dave Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement departments in the United States routinely replace bulletproof 
vests after the warranty runs out in five years, so the country is amassing 
quite a stockpile of used vests. And because officers in the United Kingdom 
have been going without, many are willing to make do with leftover American 
vests (they call them body armor over there). 
</P>
<P>
 A recent shootings of three London bobbies spurred overseas interest in 
bulletproof vests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vests are not as readily available there," Smith said. "I think that kind of 
goes back to tradition. With bobbies, many of them aren't even armed." 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance police officers, on the other hand, have worn bulletproof vests for 
about 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is virtually cost-free to the city, with Virgin Atlantic Airways 
volunteering to fly the vests to London. Torrance's contribution is due to ship 
within the next two weeks, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although manufacturers recommend that the vests be retired after five years, 
studies show they can probably last as long as 10 years. But any U.K. officer 
wanting a vest will first be asked to sign a waiver of liability in case the 
vest doesn't hold up. QUOTE OF THE WEEK 
</P>
<P>
 "I want (the vote counting) to be done. I feel like I've been in a very long 
labor."

MOBIL, TORRANCE ALTER REFINERY-SAFETY AGREEMENT; SAFETY: THE FIRM APPOINTED BY 
A JUDGE TO MONITOR CONDITIONS AT THE WORK SITE HAS BEEN REPLACED. COSTS HAD 
EXCEEDED THE PROGRAM'S BUDGET CEILING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The company named by a judge to monitor safety at the Mobil Oil Corp. refinery 
in Torrance was replaced by another firm this fall amid budget problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Westinghouse Electric Corp., which served for three years as the refinery's 
first safety adviser, was replaced Sept. 30 in the most significant revision to 
date of a 1990 pact between Mobil and the city of Torrance. The change was 
discussed by the Torrance City Council behind closed doors and was not publicly 
announced because it was considered a matter of litigation.  
</P>
<P>
 That much-heralded pact between the city and Mobil grew out of a public 
nuisance lawsuit that Torrance brought against the company after a series of 
fires and other accidents at the sprawling 750-acre refinery. Just weeks before 
trial, Mobil agreed to the appointment of a court-supervised safety adviser, an 
independent consulting firm that was supposed to monitor the refinery for seven 
years and recommend changes to improve safety. 
</P>
<P>
 But a Westinghouse spokesman says the firm received instructions in April -- 
from the court via Mobil -- to "minimize rather dramatically" its work on the 
project. Legal documents indicate that program costs have soared well above the 
$1-million ceiling originally set for the safety adviser through 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the city and Mobil have agreed to replace Westinghouse with EQE 
Engineering International of Irvine, which is working on the project under a 
revamped budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mobil has paid the safety adviser's bills, the city has spent $1.6 
million on outside legal help and experts' fees for its lawsuit against Mobil 
and the ongoing costs of seeing that the agreement is carried out.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the cost to the city and Westinghouse's departure, Torrance officials 
say they have full confidence in the monitoring project and believe it already 
has created a safer refinery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think it is a landmark activity," said Torrance City Atty. John 
Fellows. "I think we'll all stand back and be very proud of it." 
</P>
<P>
 City and Mobil officials say there is no evidence that an Oct 19 explosion and 
fire at the Mobil refinery has any relationship to changes in the safety 
adviser program. The cause of the accident, which injured 28 workers, remains 
under investigation.  
</P>
<P>
 EQE is conducting its own investigation, and its project manager, Steven T. 
Maher, said last month that he went to the refinery after the explosion and 
witnessed the emergency response firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before recent budget problems, the project was not proceeding in the way 
the city thought it would when it signed a consent decree with Mobil four years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1991 search for a safety adviser, for instance, Torrance officials 
had lobbied against Westinghouse in favor of another firm, SRI International, 
which had estimated the project's first stage alone would cost up to $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 But retired Superior Court Judge Harry V. Peetris, who is overseeing the 
project, instead chose Westinghouse, Mobil's nominee. He also set a $1 million 
spending limit for the entire program, over vehement objections from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their early unhappiness, several city officials said they are pleased 
with the program's accomplishments, and they specifically praised Maher, who 
initially served as project manager for the Mobil project when he worked for 
Westinghouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Maher left Westinghouse in March, 1993, for a job at EQE, then a subcontractor 
on the Mobil project. He remained involved in the project "in a support role 
and on an as-needed basis" but not in the "mainstream," Maher said in an 
interview last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sept. 30 agreement states that Westinghouse submitted bills for the 
project exceeding $1.35 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Westinghouse spokesman Vaughn Gilbert called the charges legitimate, saying 
they should have come as no surprise to the city or to Mobil. Westinghouse had 
informed them early on, he said, that additional work by its staff was needed 
to meet the parties' requests for a significant number of reports "to keep this 
from going back to the court." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, following an April, 1994, meeting between the city, Mobil and Judge 
Peetris, Westinghouse received instructions from the court, delivered by Mobil, 
advising it to reduce its activity, Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were told to minimize rather dramatically what we were doing there," he 
said, adding that no critical tasks were abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Torrance and Mobil said Monday they could not immediately 
confirm Westinghouse's account. Ernest Getto, an attorney representing Mobil, 
said that much of the project was complete by early this year, "so that the 
work remaining to be done by the safety adviser was a minority, a fraction." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, refinery officials say they have made significant strides in 
improving safety at the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Buckalew, refinery environmental health and safety manager, disagreed 
with the notion that the safety adviser effort was cut back. The fact that 
Mobil spent more than the $1 million cap, Buckalew said, "shows that maybe we 
did more than the consent decree asked for."  
</P>
<P>
 The project is ahead of schedule and more than 60% complete, he said. "From 
our point of view, we didn't slow down anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Copies of Westinghouse's quarterly project reports were not immediately 
available. Peetris referred an Oct. 26 request for those reports to Mobil's 
attorney, saying the reports would be available after they were reviewed for 
confidential and proprietary information. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, EQE's Maher said Monday that he recently was informed that he is 
not authorized to talk to the media and that "the appropriate interface for the 
media is through the court." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since last month, the Torrance Courthouse clerk's office has been unable to 
locate the court file for Torrance's lawsuit, including records of recent 
activity between the city and Mobil. The Times instead obtained copies of the 
Sept. 30 agreement from attorneys for the city and Mobil. 
</P>
<P>
 That agreement shows that the city and Mobil have agreed to a new formula for 
paying the safety adviser for the remainder of the seven-year project. 
</P>
<P>
 The new plan limits the amount of money Mobil must pay while opening the door 
for the city to pick up some of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 After settling accounts with Westinghouse, Mobil will provide another $360,000 
to cover EQE's anticipated budget. If costs exceed that amount, "all such 
further fees and expenses, if approved by the court, shall be borne by the 
city," states the agreement, which does not impose a new ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to make sure that the consent decree was funded sufficiently for it 
to be finished in a craftsman-like manner," said Michael Leslie, an attorney 
representing the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance Mayor Dee Hardison called the $360,000 budget realistic. "To the best 
of everyone's projections, it's sufficient," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, EQE is working on what some consider the most crucial chapter of 
the Torrance-Mobil pact -- the assessment of highly toxic hydrofluoric acid, 
which is used at the refinery to boost the octane in unleaded gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the pact, Mobil agreed to stop using hydrofluoric acid by the end of 
1997 unless it can develop a safer form of the acid by the end of this year. 
EQE is responsible for approving any modified hydrofluoric acid process 
proposed by Mobil.  
</P>
<P>
 Refinery safety has also become an issue in the review of a major Mobil 
construction project to allow production of cleaner-burning fuels. Last month's 
explosion occurred near work on the clean fuels project, a Mobil spokesman 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne will hold a hearing Friday on 
whether to halt construction at Mobil after her recent finding that the 
environmental impact report for the project was procedurally flawed. 
</P>
<P>
 William Wong, an attorney for the South Coast Air Quality Management District, 
said that Mobil should be allowed to continue work on the project. But an 
attorney representing Pipe Fitters Local 250, which brought a lawsuit 
questioning the environmental review, said the union will point to the Oct. 19 
accident as proof that construction should be halted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that the EIR needs to consider accidents that could jeopardize the 
health and safety of human beings," said the attorney, Thomas R. Adams.

IN RENT CRISIS, DISABLED MAN FEARS EVICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Patrick Fallos is accustomed to long waits. It takes him 10 minutes to walk 
five feet, three hours to type a one-page letter, half a day to get to the 
corner grocery and back. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Fallos, disabled for 10 years, is facing eviction because he cannot pay 
his rent and may have to wait into the next millennium to get help. 
</P>
<P>
 When he moved to California last spring from Wisconsin, Fallos, 45, lost his 
federal housing voucher. The move thrust him into a scramble for low-income 
housing. He can't even put his name on a waiting list for the housing subsidy 
that would pay for most of his rent and physical therapy until 2001. 
</P>
<P>
 He found the Torrance apartment in April. But without a voucher, his 
disability income is too little to cover his expenses. He's about $1,400 behind 
on his rent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the company that manages his apartment building filed a notice to 
start eviction proceedings. The company has accepted the dribs and drabs of 
cash that Fallos has given them, hoping he will find the money to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody loves him, it's just that nobody can support him," says Derinda 
Powley, who manages the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Since he was severely injured in a car accident, Fallos has tried to maximize 
the limited use of his limbs that allows him to stand, move his fingers and 
arms a bit, and walk very slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 He rides an electric scooter and uses a wheelchair to get around. These tools, 
matched with his will to stay independent, allow him to live on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Without additional physical therapy, Fallos fears his dizzy spells will 
increase, or his weakening limbs will buckle, and he will fall.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so afraid if I fall again, it could be my last," Fallos said. 
</P>
<P>
 He spends his days writing to people who might help him get his housing 
voucher back, working on his design for an amusement park for people with 
disabilities, and writing a screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
 Videotapes about brain injuries and episodes of the Three Stooges cram the 
bookshelves in his one-bedroom apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to make himself understood over the phone because his voice ranges from 
a quiet rasp to an almost inaudible whisper, Fallos relies on letters to 
communicate his situation. He types with one finger, standing awkwardly over 
the computer keyboard. After an hour or so he drops back into his wheelchair 
for a rest.  
</P>
<P>
 But Fallos is not the only one in need of low-income housing. About 50,000 
people are ahead of him on the waiting list in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably turn away 20 to 30 people a week that call me for housing," says 
Dave Wolfe, housing advocate for people with disabilities at Westside Center 
for Independent Living.  
</P>
<P>
 And unless something changes, Fallos' situation may worsen before it gets 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no money available from us," Wolfe said. "When it gets to this 
point, the only thing we can do is give people lists of homeless shelters."

FISCAL CRISIS LOOMS FOR NEW CITY MANAGER; HAWTHORNE: TODD W. ARGOW WILL INHERIT 
A CITY GOVERNMENT IN WHICH LAWSUITS AND MISMANAGEMENT HAVE HELPED CREATE A DEBT 
ESTIMATED AT $11 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Todd W. Argow takes over as Hawthorne city manager in two weeks he will 
inherit a city that has cut 10% of its work force, has asked its creditors to 
delay payments already past-due and has an estimated debt of up to $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But Argow says he is not worried. As city manager of South Gate, he turned a 
$200,000 debt into a $4-million surplus in just under three years. And 
Hawthorne has the same kinds of problems, albeit larger. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to slay dragons and you've only got so much time to do it, why 
not slay the biggest dragons?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But dodging fiery breath might be easier than controlling Hawthorne's most 
feared liability: its rapidly deteriorating financial condition. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are not exactly sure how much debt the city has, although 
finance officials have estimated it at $11 million. Years of fiscal 
mismanagement and a relatively new city staff and council, officials say, have 
made it difficult to come up with a number.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The debt, as well as pending lawsuits that could cost millions of dollars, 
have lowered the city's credit rating substantially over the past year, making 
it more expensive and difficult to borrow money, said city Finance Director 
Julia A. James. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the City Council weighed a proposal to borrow $9 million by selling 
short-term bonds, but city officials were skeptical, given the city's credit 
rating, that the bonds would sell. The council also considered taking out a 
$1.4-million line of credit to cover the city's cash-flow problems.  
</P>
<P>
 But the council postponed a decision on incurring more debt until Argow takes 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Argow and council members say they have a crisis on their hands. The 
problem is so acute that finance officials have sent more than 1,000 letters to 
the city's vendors, asking them to wait for payment while the city works out 
its financial difficulties, James said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those companies have refused to give the city credit, operating on a 
cash-on-delivery basis only; others have hired collection agencies in a futile 
attempt to get their money, James said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the city can't pay, no amount of letters will do any good," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials declined to release a list of the companies that received the 
letter. Only city payroll, attorney's bills and emergency costs have not been 
delayed, James said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eventually we'll pay everyone," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now officials are waiting for Argow's Nov. 28 arrival and the balance of the 
city's property tax revenue, which is due in December. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, city checks made out to vendors remain in the vault, and old 
expenses, such as continuing lawsuits, are growing larger. In addition, new 
expenses are being added, including a court-ordered sales tax rebate to 
aerospace companies that will cost the city hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials trace the problems back over several years but say it was not 
until earlier this year that they discovered the scope of the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, the council fired former City Manager James H. Mitsch, citing fiscal 
mismanagement. At the time, city officials estimated the city's debt at $2 
million and hoped a change of management and an improved local economy would 
remedy the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 After Mitsch's dismissal, however, the city went through three interim 
managers. One temporary manager balanced the city's budget by trimming the 
city's work force, raising the city's utility users tax and postponing 
maintenance on emergency vehicles so long that the engine in one of the city's 
paramedic vans broke down. 
</P>
<P>
 By August, the city's debt was estimated at $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Argow admits that attacking the fiscal problems will not be easy. He has a 
two-tier plan that is short on specifics and sounds like a prescription for a 
patient in critical condition: Handle the crisis and stabilize the situation, 
then look at a long-range plan for recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Argow declined to guess how long the recovery will take; James said it will 
take years.

<P>
 The head of the Los Angeles Air Force Base retired during a ceremony at Fort 
MacArthur on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Gen. Edward P. Barry Jr., commander of the Space and Missile Systems 
Center in El Segundo, worked for the U.S. Air Force for 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry, 56, supervised the development of several planes, including the F-22, 
F-15, F-16, C-17, B-1 and the Peacekeeper missile. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry was replaced by Lt. Gen. Lester Lyles, 48, former commander of the Ogden 
Air Logistics Center at Hill Air Force Base in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyles, a 26-year Air Force veteran, has been assigned to the Los Angeles base 
twice before, from 1969 to 1971 and from 1987 to 1988. SUSAN WOODWARD

CITY HALL ROUNDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY MOORE and SUSAN STEINBERG

<TEXT>
<P>
 CULVER CITY: The Culver City Council agreed Monday to continue taking part in 
the South Bay Joint Powers Consortium, a group of mayors from more than half a 
dozen cities who have been discussing ways to lower their electric rates. The 
mayors voted last month to obtain the consent of their respective city councils 
before continuing their negotiations with Southern California Edison. 
Consortium members are demanding a 25% residential rate reduction from Edison. 
The group is also considering whether its member cities should attempt to join 
forces and purchase power collectively. 
</P>
<P>
 SANTA MONICA: The Santa Monica City Council delayed voting on a controversial 
anti-smoking ordinance Tuesday after hearing dozens of restaurateurs oppose 
what would be the most restrictive smoking ban in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed ban, held over until next Tuesday's council meeting, would 
prohibit smoking in all indoor workplaces, including bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the smoking ban filled the council chambers Tuesday. The majority 
of them were business owners and employees who argued they would lose customers 
to nearby cities that do not prohibit lighting up in bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to come down to common sense. If bars outside of Santa Monica let 
people smoke, smokers will go there," said Owen Hicks, bartender at the Bob 
Burns restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a handful of supporters spoke at the meeting. Former waitress Pamela 
Rowan said she contracted pulmonary lung disease from secondhand smoke while 
working in a restaurant that she said was "like working in an ashtray." 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should I have to quit my job?" she asked. "Don't I have the right to a 
safe and healthy work environment?" 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Santa Monica bans smoking in restaurants but allows smoking in bar 
and bar areas in restaurants. The city's current law, passed last year, is 
similar to those of Los Angeles, Beverly Hills and West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council had initially discussed adopting the tough smoking ban in 
October but decided to wait until after voters determined the fate of 
Proposition 188 in the Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 188, backed by the Philip Morris tobacco company, would have 
repealed all local smoking laws, setting a statewide standard that would have 
permitted smoking in bars and restaurants. Its defeat clears the way for 
another law, Assembly Bill 13, to take effect in January. 
</P>
<P>
 AB 13, by Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Brentwood) and signed by Gov. Pete 
Wilson, bans smoking in all California restaurants, but allows lighting up in 
bars and bar areas of restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what we would prefer, to be on a level playing field with all the 
other cities," said Herb Astrow, owner of Yankee Doodles pool hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Fiondella, owner of Chez Jay, said he knows he has lost patrons in his 
restaurant since the city began requiring dining areas to be 100% smoke-free. 
As for the proposed smoking ban in bars, Fiondella said: "Santa Monica is known 
as many things, but I'd hate it to be known as the city of smoke-busters." 
</P>
<P>
 In other action, the council indefinitely extended a juvenile curfew that 
requires youths under age 18 to be off the streets by 10 p.m. on weeknights and 
11 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. The ordinance, passed in July of last year 
and set to expire on Dec. 31, allows police to prevent teen-agers from 
loitering in public places. 
</P>
<P>
 Loitering is defined as "lingering about for the purpose of committing a crime 
as the opportunity may present itself." The curfew does not affect minors 
coming home from work, running errands for their parents or attending movies, 
according to the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica Police Chief James T. Butts requested that the curfew remain in 
effect because juveniles continue to congregate at the Third Street Promenade, 
the Santa Monica Pier and Palisades Park, said Police Lt. Bill Brucker. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it was enacted, the curfew has resulted in 47 citations. The youths are 
not arrested, police said, but are taken to the police station and released to 
their parents. MARY MOORE and SUSAN STEINBERG

SOUTH BAY / COVER STORY; NIGHT WATCH; PARENTS WHO WORK NON-TRADITIONAL HOURS 
ARE TURNING TO SUCH EVENING CHILD CARE PROGRAMS AS ONE AT THE TORRANCE Y FOR 
HELP. PROVIDERS SEEK TO CREATE A FEELING OF FAMILY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It looks like dinner hour in any big family. Christopher, 8, passes out the 
paper dinner plates, Briana, 7, and Kaylee, 3, organize the plastic silverware. 
Altogether, six children sit down together to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 It's family style, but the children aren't at home.  
</P>
<P>
 During their meal of fish sticks, scalloped potatoes and salad, Cathryn 
Steven, 27, gently reminds them to stop kicking each other under the table and 
to try a bite of everything. 
</P>
<P>
 They are at the new YWCA Home Away From Home Evening Care program, where 
Steven and the staff have created the first nighttime child care available in 
the South Bay outside private homes.  
</P>
<P>
 As more families depend on a single parent or need both parents to work 
non-traditional hours, the need for flexible child care has increased. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who work at night in refineries, restaurants, hospitals, police 
departments or the post office are just a few examples of those who need help 
with their children at night. Experts agree that the best place for a child to 
sleep is probably in his or her own bed, but not all parents can be at home. 
The next-best thing seems to be care-givers who create the feeling of family -- 
albeit a big family. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, grandparents or older siblings have cared for children while 
parents work. Sometimes parents could also find child care in someone's home.  
</P>
<P>
 But often tenuous arrangements for evening child care fail, leaving parents 
desperate. A study by Mobil Oil Corp. found that night-shift employees at its 
Torrance refinery had their share of problems. 
</P>
<P>
 One divorced father has primary custody of his 7- and 8-year-old sons. Once, 
when his baby-sitter didn't show up, he brought his children to sleep in his 
car in the parking lot during his 12-hour graveyard shift. Another time he 
decided to leave the children home alone, but panicked when he called them 
about 7 p.m. and got no answer. He rushed home to find them fast asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 One mom arranged for her son's preschool teacher to drop him off at the Mobil 
parking lot, leaving him in her pickup truck. When she got out to the lot, the 
5-year-old wasn't there. Because another mother was late picking up her child, 
the teacher couldn't get away for more than half an hour. The Mobil worker said 
it was the most horrible feeling, not knowing where her child was. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 400 employees at its Torrance refinery on rotating schedules 
that include nights and weekends, Mobil found that the company was suffering 
because of child-care complications like these. A study sponsored by the 
company found that it could save an average of $6,000 a month if it could curb 
absenteeism caused by child-care problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobil approached the Torrance YWCA to create a way to help parents cope with 
child care. The first step, a traditional preschool, opened in September, 1993. 
Mobil spent about $50,000 in labor and materials to construct the portable 
building that houses the daytime and evening care programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it opened Sept. 14, the evening care program has registered more than 20 
children. Parents can bring little ones to the Carson Street building from 3 
p.m. to midnight Monday through Friday. The program accepts children 2 to 14.  
</P>
<P>
 The staff strives to create an orderly but relaxed mood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not pizza in front of the TV," says YWCA child care director Rebecca 
Jessop. "It's more structured, with a home atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 Each week the group's activities follow a theme. One week the subject was 
fall, so one day the children made leaf collages, the next they studied the 
changes in the trees on the playground, and on the third day they painted with 
fall colors -- yellow, brown and orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Children bring pajamas, a towel, a toothbrush and bedding. Bedtime depends on 
the child's age. YWCA staff say the most important thing is to keep the 
children stimulated but provide a comfortable environment. 
</P>
<P>
 For evening care the YWCA charges $4.50 to $5.50 an hour for one or two 
children and $2.50 an hour for each additional child. Dinner costs $3 per 
child.  
</P>
<P>
 Because nurses work around the clock, much of the experience with evening 
child-care centers has been at hospitals.  
</P>
<P>
 One company that used to offer its employees evening child care was Children's 
Hospital of Los Angeles. For 10 years, the nurses on night shift could bring 
their youngsters to a conference room at the hospital for overnight care. When 
the furniture was shifted out of the way, children from 3 months to 16 years 
would camp out between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nice part about it was that your child was here," said Ellen Zaman, 
director of patient family services for the hospital. "But there are a lot of 
people who see a down side to night care, because the child has to be 
(awakened) very early in the morning."  
</P>
<P>
 Besides having to move their beds and toys out of the way each day, the 
children washed, had breakfast and got ready for school at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a developmental standpoint, you don't have much of a family life if you 
are on site with your parent," Zaman said. 
</P>
<P>
 When costs forced the hospital to charge for the sleep-over care, participants 
dropped from 40 to 20. Last fall, the hospital discontinued the program and put 
all of its resources into daytime care, Zaman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents feel that the best possible solution when they have to work 
evening hours is to find another home where their children can stay.  
</P>
<P>
 In the South Bay, parents can find home-based evening child care through 
state-funded referral lines and private associations of home-care providers. 
These groups offer referrals to their members, but relatively few of the 
home-care providers offer evening hours. Of the 80 members of the South Bay 
Child Care Assn., for example, only five offer evening care. 
</P>
<P>
 When Kathi Darling started tending bar and taking paralegal classes at night, 
finding someone to trust with her baby presented a problem. Darling is 
separated from the boy's father, and the rest of her family lives in Northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Where could she take the cherubic 15-month-old? 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're looking for someone who'll let you show up at 3 in the morning to 
pick him up, they're hard to find," Darling said. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer turned out to be Kathy Harrison-Imel, another single mom who has 
her own toddler and does evening care in her home. Harrison-Imel is listed with 
several of the South Bay referral lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by the same problem, Harrison-Imel had decided that if she couldn't 
find evening care for her daughter, Brittany, others might need help too. So 
about six months ago, she got a state license to care for children in her home. 
Now she specializes in evening and weekend care. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Holmstedt is another home-based evening care provider. She estimates that 
hundreds of children have spent time at her home preschool and evening care 
center in the 15 years she has been open. Their smiling pictures hang all over 
her house. 
</P>
<P>
 A huge castle, complete with turret and slide, dominates the main room, making 
Holmstedt's house look a bit like a Little Tikes distributorship. The toy 
manufacturer's play stations -- a workbench with plastic tools, an easel, 
stove, sink and cupboard and a beauty parlor set -- take up every inch of space 
along the walls in the room where the children play. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with all the activity, the house has a sense of order and calm, with 
Holmstedt smoothing the way. She instructs the children to put back one play 
set before getting out another, and helps them resolve fights over toys with 
apologies and good humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Holmstedt has cared for children in her Torrance home day and night since 
1979, when her own daughter needed someone to watch her twins as she worked 
rotating shifts for the Los Angeles Police Department.  
</P>
<P>
 About five nights a week Holmstedt has children in the evening, and her 
daytime preschool almost always has a waiting list for one of the 12 spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley, a vivacious 22-month-old-with tiny dimples and pigtails, has a mom who 
drives a bus on a split shift. Ashley stays with the Holmstedts several days a 
week, sometimes starting as early as 4 a.m., and at other times remaining until 
late evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Holmstedt's daughter, many of the parents who need evening care come from 
law enforcement. Her current roster includes the children of Torrance and Los 
Angeles police officers and sheriff's deputies.  
</P>
<P>
 California law requires in-home day-care providers to get a license. Their 
homes are inspected for safety, and they must take 15 hours of instruction each 
year in CPR, first aid and infectious diseases. Each provider can care for up 
to six children alone, or 12 with an aide, and the care cannot last more than 
24 hours. For evening care the rules are the same, although the inspector will 
also look for comfortable places for the children to sleep, said Sallee Kraics 
of the state Department of Social Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the YWCA and home providers stress that the tone of evening care has to 
be different. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Holmstedt and her husband encourage the children to call them Nana and 
Papa. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what we're trying to show them, that we're an extension of their 
family. They're a part of it, so they can relax," Holmstedt says. 
</P>
<P>
 The affectionate names reveal another reason home care is popular. Many 
families live far away from the traditional supports of grandparents and other 
family members. 
</P>
<P>
 Most evening-care providers try to create the feeling of family and community 
while winding down the day. Many of the children have been in preschools 
earlier in the day, and need a change of pace, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that you could create that would be as homelike as possible would 
give the children a sense of comfort," says Cynthia Whitham, a staff therapist 
in UCLA's parent training program. What children need, Whitham says, is a 
comforting atmosphere and a sense of structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Escobedo, associate director of the Child Care Resource Center in North 
Hollywood, agrees. Her agency gets more than 40 calls a month for referrals to 
evening child care. 
</P>
<P>
 Most parents feel home care is like taking their children to a relative's 
house rather than an institution, Escobedo says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's what makes it feel the most comfortable. Besides being a safe 
place, the child isn't missing out on the intimacies of settling down for the 
night," Escobedo says. "It kind of gives closure to the day."  
</P>
<P>
 While the need for evening child care appears to be growing, the high cost of 
paying providers will probably limit the number of public evening care 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though it's crucial for the people who need it, it is a very small 
number compared to the overall demand," Escobedo said. "It isn't cost-effective 
for most centers to offer evening programs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But some organizations recognize they need child care at night, especially if 
they are trying to attract women workers. Last month, the Los Angeles Women 
Police Officer's Assn. announced it would start raising funds for a 24-hour 
child care center Downtown. The group hopes the center will be the first of 
four that will serve the children of LAPD employees. 
</P>
<P>
 And, despite the challenges of financing evening care, the YWCA is committed 
to going to a 24-hour schedule, starting next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year the children gathered around the table may be eating scrambled eggs 
and breakfast cereal together, in addition to their evening meal of fish sticks 
and scalloped potatoes.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: A GALLOPING GASTRONOME

 It was on the sidewalks of Lyon, one of the gastronomic capitals of France, 
that Marco D'Orsi developed his fascination for restaurant life -- the 
long-aproned waiters, the tuxedoed maitre d's, the flaming dishes, even the 
oyster shucker. But it was at home that his palette was fine-tuned.His Italian 
mother, a good cook herself, taught him the nuances of various extra-virgin 
olive oils and the difference between properly aged Parmigiano-Reggiano and 
what often passes for Parmesan cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 After gigs in Italy, Luxembourg and Belgium, D'Orsi came to California, where 
he met Sam Ibrahim. Today the two are co-owners of the 4-month-old Cafe 
Ritrovo, a sleek Mediterranean restaurant in Redondo Beach. D'Orsi is the chef, 
of course; Ibrahim is the busy and attentive maitre d'.  
</P>
<P>
 The short, but tempting, appetizer menu includes a baked spinach buckwheat 
pancake with Parmesan (Reggiano, of course), garlic and bread crumbs topped 
with a light tomato sauce ($5.50). White cannellini beans are sauteed with 
shrimp and sweet onions ($7.75). 
</P>
<P>
 Often available is a homey, comforting bowl of risotto with pancetta bacon, 
cannellini beans, cubed potatoes and celery hearts ($12) that tastes as if it 
could cure the common cold -- call it Italian penicillin, if you will. 
</P>
<P>
 Spaghetti alla puttanesca features anchovies, garlic, black olives and capers 
($8.50). A less salty dish, linguine Siciliana, is topped with eggplant, bell 
peppers, zucchini and tomatoes ($8.25). 
</P>
<P>
 The popular soupe de poisson ($12.50) features the chef's daily selection of 
fresh fish in a spicy tomato broth. 
</P>
<P>
 Cafe Ritrovo is at 1304 Pacific Coast Highway, Redondo Beach. (310) 540-8799. 
Open daily 5 to 11 p.m.

 THE POSTSEASON 
</P>
<P>
 Let's face it, prep playoffs are a gas: a tournament of thrills, spills and 
surprises played out in the unforgiving format of single elimination. One loss 
and you're gone, and don't let the door hit you on the way out. 
</P>
<P>
 Good teams will lose sooner than expected and wonder why. Others will stick 
around longer than anyone thought possible and pinch themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Bay will be represented by 12 teams in the Southern Section and City 
Section football playoffs, which start Friday night. (Yes, we know the 
eight-man playoffs started last week, but that's a different game). 
</P>
<P>
 Optimism runs high at this time of year, so it's a cruel and heartless job 
telling teams they haven't got a Democrat's chance in an election of reaching 
the second round. But someone has to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at the area's playoff entries, listed under categories rating 
their chances of winning a division title. BEST BETS 
</P>
<P>
 Mira Costa (Southern Section Division VII) -- Talent-wise, the Mustangs are 
nothing to get excited about. But you can't underestimate experience nor the 
impact Coach Don Morrow has had on this once foundering program. Mira Costa is 
22-2 in two seasons under Morrow, whose ability to make key personnel changes 
has paid off again. After the Mustangs lost to Culver City, 33-21, in the sixth 
week, Morrow switched quarterbacks, promoting sophomore Kevin Cooper. The 
change has given the team a better passing attack to go along with the running 
threat of tailback Mike Fikes, who became eligible late last season and helped 
Mira Costa win the Division VII title. The second-seeded Mustangs would like 
nothing better than to reach the final and play top-seeded Culver City, the 
only team to beat them in the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Peninsula (Division II) -- The second-seeded Panthers are undeniably the 
hottest team in the area, winning their last eight games by a combined score of 
332-49 and running away with the Bay League title. Peninsula seemingly has all 
the qualities to challenge for the Division II title -- a potent running game 
led by running back Petros Papadakis and quarterback Peter Krogh, a dominant 
offensive line and a strong defense. But one question remains: If the Panthers 
fall behind, can they pass the ball? Having a one-dimensional offense hasn't 
hurt Peninsula yet, but it could, especially in a division that boasts such 
talented teams as Newhall Hart, Compton Dominguez and Pasadena Muir. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Star (Division X) -- What's gotten into Mary Star? After enduring 1-9, 
0-10 and 1-8 seasons, the Stars qualified for the playoffs with a 9-1 record 
and as co-champions of the Santa Fe League. Sure, leaving the more competitive 
Camino Real League helped, but it doesn't diminish the job done by first-year 
Coach Dino Andrie and his undermanned squad. This will be a season to 
celebrate, even if the fourth-seeded Stars bow out in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson (City Section 4-A Division) -- Well, why not? Everything else has 
happened to the Colts this season, so what could be more fitting than a 2-8 
team beating the odds to successfully defend their title? After forfeiting 
three conference victories because of an ineligible player, Carson knew it had 
to win last week to have a chance of making the playoffs. The Colts responded 
by routing Washington, 58-13. Franklin (9-1), Carson's first-round opponent, 
should be more than a little nervous. LONG ROAD TO NOWHERE 
</P>
<P>
 Leuzinger (Division II) -- For Leuzinger, road maps and bus rides seem to play 
as big a part in playoff openers as X's and O's. The Olympians went to Santa 
Barbara two years ago and lost to San Marcos, 24-7. Last season, they lost at 
Newbury Park, 39-6. Awaiting the not-so-happy wanderers Friday is a three-hour 
drive north to Burroughs of Ridgecrest, where nighttime temperatures regularly 
dip in the 30s this time of year. Leuzinger probably deserved a better draw 
after winning its last five games, capped by an impressive 20-8 victory over 
Hawthorne, to finish second in the Bay League. If the Olympians win, they'll 
most likely meet top-seeded Hart in the second round. Ouch. 
</P>
<P>
 Serra (Division III) -- The Cavaliers avoided a disastrous season by winning 
their last two games to finish third in the Camino Real League and nail down 
the league's last playoff spot. Their reward? Having to drive to Santa Barbara 
to play Channel League champion San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance (Division II) and South Torrance (Division VII) -- At-large berths 
are a strange accomplishment. Teams scramble to get them, then usually draw a 
powerhouse team and get hammered. Torrance and South, the fourth-place teams 
from the Bay and Ocean leagues, are headed down that road. Torrance plays at 
top-seeded Hart (10-0) and South plays at third-seeded Lompoc (9-1). NOT THIS 
YEAR 
</P>
<P>
 Hawthorne (Division II) -- All good things must come to an end. Hawthorne, 
which has an 8-2 playoff record and two finals appearances in three previous 
seasons under Coach Dan Robbins, will be hard-pressed to get out of the first 
round this year. The Cougars play Friday at San Gabriel Valley League champion 
Paramount, a physical team that should exploit Hawthorne's lack of strength up 
front, the same way Peninsula and Leuzinger did in league play. 
</P>
<P>
 San Pedro (4-A Division) -- After winning the last two 3-A Division titles, 
San Pedro moves up with the big boys to the 4-A, where it belongs. The Pirates 
would have a shot at the title if this were last year's team, but they don't 
appear to possess the offensive firepower needed to make a serious run. San 
Pedro scored more than 14 points in only two of its seven Southern Pacific 
Conference games. Still, the Pirates' consistent defense should make things 
tough on Westchester, champion of the anemic Coastal Conference. SHORT LIVES 
</P>
<P>
 Banning (4-A Division) and Gardena (3-A Division) -- Even if Banning and 
Gardena get past their first-round opponents -- and chances of that happening 
are slim -- they would most likely draw top-seeded Sylmar and Reseda, 
respectively, in the second round. But a playoff victory would be an 
accomplishment for Gardena (3-6-1), which was 0-10 last season and has made 
great strides under second-year Coach Donald Threatt. Come to think of it, a 
playoff victory would also be an accomplishment for Banning. The Pilots are 0-2 
in postseason play under Ed Paculba, whose days as coach might be numbered if 
Banning comes up empty-handed again. NOT PRETTY 
</P>
<P>
 In case you were wondering, the six schools that were previously in the 
Pioneer League -- Torrance, West Torrance, North Torrance, South Torrance, El 
Segundo and Centennial -- were a combined 6-24 and outscored, 888-398, against 
holdovers from the Bay and Ocean leagues this football season. NOTABLE 
</P>
<P>
 Yanick Clay, a 6-foot forward for the Inglewood High girls' basketball team, 
has signed a letter of intent to attend North Carolina and play for the 1993-94 
NCAA women's champions. Clay, who averaged 15.6 points and 9.7 rebounds as a 
junior, chose North Carolina over UCLA and San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
 The Loyola Marymount women's volleyball team can clinch the West Coast 
Conference title and an NCAA tournament berth with a victory either Friday 
against St. Mary's or Saturday against Santa Clara at Gersten Pavilion. Suzanne 
Radcliffe, a sophomore from Torrance High, had 17 kills and seven digs Saturday 
to help Loyola (17-9, 10-2 in the WCC) beat Pepperdine, three games to one. It 
was the 100th career victory for Coach Steve Stratos. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino College quarterback Steve Sarkisian continued to rewrite the school 
record book Saturday, passing for 332 yards and five touchdowns in a 45-13 
victory over San Diego Mesa. Sarkisian surpassed Tim Green (1981-82) in most 
passing yards (3,305) and touchdown passes (34) in a season. El Camino (8-1), 
ranked 12th in the nation, completes the regular season Saturday night at 
Pasadena.

 South Bay bodyboarders won three of six events at a National Scholastic 
Surfing Assn. event at Oceanside on Nov. 5. Winning their divisions were John

COMMUNITY NEWS: PORT OF LOS ANGELES; WASTE BAG STUCK ON BARGE DELAYS DREDGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan to dredge contaminated waste from Marina del Rey channel and dump it on 
the floor of the Los Angeles Harbor has hit a snag: getting the waste off the 
barge.  
</P>
<P>
 When the first barge-load arrived in the harbor Nov. 10, the sediment, 
contained in a plastic, sausage-like "geo-tube," wouldn't budge. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tried to dump from the barge and the bag stuck," said Dwayne Lee, deputy 
executive director of development at the port. "They put too much material in 
the bag and the hole (in the barge) is too small." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which tried for months to get approval for 
the dredging project, was still trying to get the material out of the barge 
Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're tapping the geo-tube down with a large piece of equipment that will 
force it through the hole," spokesman Fred-Otto Egeler said.  
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, three more geo-tubes, packed to about one-third the size of 
the first, have successfully slid from other barges into the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 While the corps is trying to dislodge the first load and dredge more from 
Marina del Rey, the time it has to complete the project is ticking away. 
</P>
<P>
 The corps plans to store about 132,000 cubic yards of sediment in the harbor 
as fill for part of the Pier 300/400 expansion project. Port officials agreed 
to take on the Army Corps' material, but not at the expense of their own 
expansion project, which began in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The corps has to finish dumping the geo-tubes by Dec. 1, when the port plans 
to cover them with 15 feet of clean material. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't make sense to let a $3-million project delay (our) $150-million 
project," Lee said.  
</P>
<P>
 The commission will hold a final public hearing on the project at a meeting 
Friday. The meeting begins at 9 a.m. at Clarion Hotel-Bayview, 660 K St., San 
Diego.

PEOPLE: TEACHER'S HELPER REALLY FILLS THE BILL IN UNDERWATER EXERCISE CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES HILLINGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of the underwater exercise class at the Jack Kramer Tennis Club 
swimming pool in Rolling Hills Estates have two instructors, Nan Lewis and 
Frazier. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier is a duck. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past year every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 7 to 8 a.m., Lewis 
and her broad-billed, web-footed Pekin duck have been leading 15 to 25 people 
through the exercise sessions.  
</P>
<P>
 The exercisers are in the water. The natural instinct of the duck is to join 
them in the pool. But Frazier stays on the deck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frazier is well-trained. He'd love to dive in the water and join them, but he 
knows he's needed up here with me on the pool deck to help conduct the 
exercises," Lewis says. 
</P>
<P>
 Music plays over a loudspeaker as Lewis and Frazier lead the group in leg and 
triceps presses. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis swings her arms and lifts her legs to the music. Frazier shakes a leg 
and wags his tail. 
</P>
<P>
 The duck lifts his right leg in the air, stands and stares at the participants 
for several minutes, then does the same with his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis jaunts back and forth as do the people in the water. Frazier waddles 
closely behind the instructor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frazier is a riot," says Shirley Cozen. "He does the same thing Nan does in 
his own ducky way. Frazier keeps us all in stitches." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point the duck's eyes blink, then slowly close tight. People shout: 
"Wake up Frazier! Wake up Frazier!" 
</P>
<P>
 The duck opens his eyes, cocks his head, waddles over to Lewis and unties her 
shoelaces with his broad bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes Frazier leans over into the pool and tries to give one of us a kiss 
with his bill," Mary Lou Damon says. "We duck out of the way. A kiss from 
Frazier and we'd be missing half a lip."  
</P>
<P>
 Exercisers wear swimsuits and inflated cuffs on their wrists and ankles. The 
cuffs help keep their shoulders above water. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuffs also increase the resistance of the water, requiring three times 
more effort to move arms and legs, increasing both cardiovascular and muscular 
strength and endurance, Lewis says. 
</P>
<P>
 Those in the class insist water exercise is great. Harle Damon, 72, had a knee 
replacement recently and his doctor recommended this form of exercise as 
therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrea Craig says she lost 103 pounds exercising with Lewis and Frazier three 
times a week and watching her diet. 
</P>
<P>
 Why a duck at an exercise class? 
</P>
<P>
 "I never set out to get a duck. My daughter gave me Frazier as a pet. The duck 
follows me everywhere. One day I brought Frazier with me to the exercise class 
as a lark," Lewis recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody loved the duck. So Frazier joined the class. 
</P>
<P>
 She says Frazier, who takes his social cues from the people around him, is so 
charming he even gets invited to parties with her. "Once Frazier and I received 
an invitation to a formal dinner party. I dressed Frazier in a black tie and 
tuxedo. He was the hit of the party."

COMMUNITY NEWS: GARDENA; CONTROVERSIAL MALL PLAN GETS PRELIMINARY OK

 City officials have given preliminary approval to a controversial shopping 
center development and want construction to begin as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members James W. Cragin, Gwen Duffy, and Mas Fukai approved a 
draft environmental report on the plan for a 54,000-square-foot Smith's Food & 
Drug Center last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Donald L. Dear and Councilman Paul Y. Tsukahara did not attend the 
council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kenneth W. Landau said the city is eager for the development at 
Artesia Boulevard and Vermont Avenue to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction will start as soon as site is leveled, Landau said. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmental report has drawn strong criticism from some sections of the 
community in part because the site is next to a wetland. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Recreation and Open Space Committee says the environmental 
report does not adequately assess the development's effects on about seven 
acres known as the Gardena Willows. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee spokesman Frank O'Brien has also questioned the city's role in the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, city officials have been negotiating with Sunnyvale developer John 
Vidovich of De Anza Properties, recently offering him a $1-million tax 
incentive to bring Smith's to Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say the center will not harm the adjacent willows. And Fukai 
said the city has offered sales tax rebates to developers before to encourage 
them to come to Gardena. SUSAN WOODWARD

COMMUNITY NEWS: PENINSULA; SCHOOL DISTRICT ALTERS INVESTMENT STRATEGY 
</P>

<P>
 Hoping to earn more money, Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District 
trustees have decided to invest up to $3 million in U.S. Treasury notes rather 
than in a county investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees in a 5-0 vote Monday decided to invest $500,000 in one-year notes and 
$1.5 million in two-year notes.In the next 45 days, after the Federal Reserve 
is expected to re-examine interest rates, the school will decide how to invest 
another $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-year Treasury notes earn about 6.75% interest. School district money in 
the county pool, an investment fund of money from school and special districts, 
earns about 4.5%. The higher interest rates should net the school district 
about $150,000, school board President Joan Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Districts often invest in the county pool because about half the investments 
are for 90 days, and the district money is more accessible. But Palos Verdes 
can afford to tie up its money for a longer time and earn more interest because 
of a $7.2-million surplus from the sale of undeveloped land once targeted for a 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
 About $2.1 million has already been earmarked to buy computers and to repair 
buildings in the next year. Davidson said trustees may invest the remaining 
money in Treasury notes or at a later date in a state pool that is similar to 
the county pool. JEFF KASS

 TUNING OUT RUSH: Memo to Rush Limbaugh: Bill Clinton isn't listening. In a 
recent interview, Clinton said he doesn't tune into his ebulliently 
conservative nemesis. "I have no problems with his views," the President said. 
"It's the attack nature of his communication. Instead of a conversation and a 
dialogue, it's all bomb-throwing. It's very entertaining, but it contributes to 
this sort of blockage people have . . . where we can't hear people who disagree 
with us." On the other hand, the President said he tries to keep up with the 
work of critics he considers thoughtful, like former Cabinet secretaries Jack 
Kemp and William J. Bennett. "When they wrote the piece they wrote on 
(California's) Proposition 187," Clinton said, "I couldn't have said it any 
better myself."

 BOOTING BOB: Republican leaders in Congress are relishing the opportunity to 
replace Robert Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, when 
they take control in January. Republicans view Reischauer as an overly partisan 
Democrat who issued budget reports critical of their favorite tax plans. They 
note that Reischauer is close to Alice Rivlin, director of the Office of 
Management and Budget and author of a recent memo that Republicans claimed 
during the fall campaign showed that President Clinton planned to slash Social 
Security and raise taxes. Even Reischauer's controversial decision to issue a 
report critical of the Clinton health care plan earlier this year didn't win 
much Republican support. "Even a blind pig stumbles into the truth once in a 
while," grumbled the likely new House majority leader, Rep. Dick Armey 
(R-Tex.).

 STRAIGHT MAN: Despite the drubbing the Democrats took at the polls, Vice 
President Al Gore said at a news conference Wednesday that he feels "so much

since tearing his Achilles' tendon in August. But then he stiffened his body, 
his face went blank and the political performer who has been teased for his 
wooden campaign style deadpanned: "They tell me I'll have to wear the old 
full-body cast for several more years." Surrounded by Republicans, perhaps body 
armor would be a better choice.

 RELUCTANT REPUBLICAN: Don't expect Massachusetts Gov. William F. Weld to join 
the Republicans who are tripping over each other on their way to the 1996 
presidential starting line. Weld, a fiscally conservative but socially moderate 
former U.S. attorney, is frequently mentioned as a prospective candidate. But 
one of his chief Boston backers said Weld has been reluctant to make any moves 
in that direction. He doesn't want to divert his attention until Massachusetts 
has completed its economic recovery, or subject his wife and five children to 
the intensive media attention involved in a presidential campaign. "A group of 
us want to really launch things for '96, and he is saying: 'Please, please,

U.N. WELCOMES IRAQ'S KUWAIT STANCE, IS SPLIT ON CURBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Security Council on Wednesday welcomed Iraq's recognition of Kuwait after 
a protracted debate that revealed the near-total isolation of the United States 
on the issue of lifting sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 In a unanimously approved declaration read by U.S. Ambassador to the United 
Nations Madeleine Albright, president for the month of November, the council 
said it "considers this decision by Iraq to be a significant step in the 
direction towards implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Until a compromise was finally reached, the United States, supported only by 
Britain, found itself opposed by the 13 other members of the council on the 
wording of the declaration that amounted to the United Nations' official 
acknowledgment of Iraq's renunciation of its claims to a country it invaded in 
1990, leading to the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, the debate sounded like a squabble over quibbles; a U.S. 
official derided it as an argument over "semicolons and colons." 
</P>
<P>
 But the debate reflected deep divisions within the Security Council, and it is 
now clear that there is very little support for the Clinton Administration's 
insistence that all sanctions remain in place on Iraq until it complies with a 
host of Security Council resolutions. The prevailing view appears to be that if 
Iraq allows a system of permanent monitoring for arms violations on its soil, 
then the council should reward Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in six months or 
so with at least a partial lifting of the ban on its sale of oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Some ambassadors also displayed annoyance over a packet of aerial photographs 
that Albright passed around on Monday as evidence that Hussein was lavishing 
more than $1 billion on the restoration and construction of government palaces 
and lavish residences while bemoaning the effects of the international economic 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The buildings were wasteful," one Security Council ambassador said, "but they 
were irrelevant to the question of sanctions. If sanctions were related to the 
construction of lavish buildings, there would be a lot of countries in that 
region under sanctions. I think that showing the photos was an act of 
desperation." 
</P>
<P>
 According to diplomatic sources, the problem arose Tuesday when Albright 
proposed what one ambassador called a "minimalist" declaration welcoming the 
arrival of official documents from Iraq recognizing the independence of Kuwait. 
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tarik Aziz had handed the papers to Albright in a 
brief, cold meeting the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 In the key phrase of the Albright proposal, the Security Council would say 
that it considered the recognition of Kuwait "a step in the direction towards 
implementation" of the resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese Ambassador Li Zhaoxing, who usually takes a passive role on the 
council, surprised the Americans by proposing that the key phrase in the 
declaration state instead that the council regarded the recognition as "an 
important step in the right direction towards implementation" of the 
resolutions, another Security Council ambassador recounted. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen ambassadors accepted the Chinese proposal but Albright, supported by 
British Ambassador David Hannay, refused it. This deadlock was not broken until 
Wednesday morning, when Hannay proposed compromise wording that would have the 
declaration describe the recognition as "a significant step in the direction 
towards implementation." All 15 agreed, and the Security Council issued the 
declaration. 
</P>
<P>
 But the unanimous declaration hid a great divide. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a growing feeling in the council," one of the ambassadors said, 
"that since the Iraqis are cooperating . . . they have to be somehow rewarded." 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans argue that the United Nations must not lift the oil sanctions 
until it is sure of Hussein's "peaceful intentions"; otherwise he cannot be 
trusted to allow monitoring in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. government says, moreover, that it cannot be sure of Hussein's good 
intentions until he complies with all the demands of all the resolutions. These 
include the return of property stolen from Kuwait, a halt to his persecution of 
minorities, an accounting of all Kuwaiti prisoners, a halt to terrorism and the 
payment of compensation to all those injured, even indirectly, by the invasion.

REPORT CALLS CHILDREN WAR'S CHIEF VICTIMS

 Children are even more likely than soldiers to be killed in wars, according to 
a report by the relief agency Save the Children. The group says 1.5 million 
children died in war zones in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional 4 million children were permanently injured by bombs, bullets, 
land mines, chemical weapons and machete attacks, said the report, released 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new world order has proved to be a world of disorder for civilians, and 
particularly children," said Mike Aaronson, overseas director for Save the 
Children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nine out of 10 casualties of war are civilians," he said. "Children are very 
often the main casualties -- and they are indeed much more likely to be 
casualties of war than are soldiers." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten million children -- one of every 200 worldwide -- have been traumatized by 
the effects of war, 12 million have lost their homes and 5 million have been 
forced to live in refugee camps in the last decade, the report says.

<P>
 In a race decided by a Ping-Pong ball, Republican Randall Luthi won a seat in 
the state House on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A ball bearing Luthi's name was drawn from the battered cowboy hat of Gov. 
Mike Sullivan during a meeting of the state Canvassing Board, settling the race 
Luthi tied with independent Larry Call. 
</P>
<P>
 Each candidate got 1,941 votes in the Nov. 8 election. State law calls for 
such ties to be settled by drawing lots. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is democracy at its best," proclaimed the declared winner.

COURT-MARTIAL URGED IN COPTER DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A military judge has recommended that an Air Force radar plane officer be 
court-martialed in the downing of two U.S. helicopters over Iraq that killed 26 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Another crewman aboard the AWACS plane should receive only administrative 
punishment, and charges against three others should be dismissed, Air Force 
Col. Bill Colwell recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 His recommendation, announced Wednesday, goes to Lt. Gen. Stephen Croker, 
commander of the 8th Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
 The Army Black Hawk helicopters were shot down in the "no fly" zone over 
northern Iraq on April 14 by two Air Force F-15 fighters. The F-15 pilots 
believed that the Black Hawks were Iraqi craft. 
</P>
<P>
 The helicopters were carrying members of an international group that had been 
working with Kurds in northern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 The AWACS officers were accused of failing to warn the jet pilots that U.S. 
helicopters were in the zone, failing to ensure that the helicopters broadcast 
correct identification codes and failing to monitor the area properly. 
</P>
<P>
 Colwell recommended a court-martial for Capt. Jim Wang, administrative 
discipline for 1st. Lt. Joseph Halcli and dismissal of charges against Maj. 
Douglas Martin, Maj. Lawrence Tracey and 2nd Lt. Ricky Wilson.

POPULAR OFFICIAL HIGHLY RESPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than just an administrator, Richard Wittenberg is a man who has smoothly 
guided Ventura County government for the last 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 He has thrived in a job often plagued with quick turnover by playing the role 
of peacemaker between quarreling staff members as well as a succession of 
strong-willed bosses on the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 His self-deprecating humor and soft-touch allowed him to develop a close 
personal relationship with county officials and community leaders. And, even 
some of his detractors say they find him easy to like -- despite political 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always liked Richard personally," said Supervisor John K. Flynn, who has 
clashed repeatedly with Wittenberg in recent years. "He tries to use his 
personality to bring people together and it usually works." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Wittenberg managed to hold enormous sway over county business 
by drafting its $800-million annual budget and spending considerable time with 
each of the supervisors going over issues before they came up for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a remarkable feat for a socially liberal Democrat in a conservative 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the last two or three or four years, he's played too strong a role," said 
Flynn, who has recently bucked the majority on a variety of issues. "He took on 
more authority because there was a vacuum of leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 Other county officials hotly dispute the assertion that Wittenberg has partly 
controlled the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "He certainly lays out the direction he thinks the county ought to go," said 
Supervisor Maggie Kildee, perhaps Wittenberg's closest board ally. "But he has 
the uncanny ability to take direction from the supervisors." 
</P>
<P>
 Former county official Bob Braitman attributed Wittenberg's success to his 
honesty and his ability to quickly tackle projects of interest to board 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 "Richard doesn't procrastinate. He doesn't put them on a 'to do' list," said 
Braitman, who worked with Wittenberg for 21 years. As a result, he said, 
Wittenberg and his staff could nimbly respond to requests from supervisors and 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "Richard Wittenberg reflected the board and in some aspects led the board by 
educating them and informing them on issues," Braitman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether he led the board or followed it, most attribute his success to his 
smooth style. 
</P>
<P>
 To watch him work a crowd, one would think Wittenberg was an elected leader 
instead of the county's most powerful bureaucrat. 
</P>
<P>
 He loves to schmooze and is equally comfortable talking to power-brokers and 
gadflies. He remembers every name and asks about every spouse and child. And, 
he loves to kid around, mostly cracking jokes at his own expense. 
</P>
<P>
 His humor often makes reference to his thrifty nature, which he calls "cheap." 
He proudly displays his $5 ties, despite pulling in about $123,000 yearly as 
chief administrative officer. He drove a big brown 1983 Ford sedan until 
recently, when his wife insisted that he trade up to a 1987 Thunderbird being 
sold by a neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Wittenberg shows a sincere interest in the personal affairs of his employees 
and others in the community. He attends funerals of their relatives, drops 
personal notes to those celebrating good news and those struggling with bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Those personal connections have developed deep affection and loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the best boss anyone could ask for," said Yolanda Tibbet, one of the 30 
employees who work directly under Wittenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 She still remembers that Wittenberg visited her in the hospital a decade ago 
when she gave birth to a baby with cerebral palsy. He came with flowers and a 
sympathetic ear. As her daughter has grown up, Wittenberg has often asked 
Tibbet about her child. 
</P>
<P>
 That gush of goodwill is tough on his detractors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Richard romances the board members. He romances the press. He play golfs with 
them. So if you ever try to go up against him, you are going up against the 
so-called power structure," said one county official, who asked to remain 
anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 Other county officials praise him for giving them the latitude to do their 
work, without leaning over their shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's low-key," said Kay Doyle, a county analyst who has worked for Wittenberg 
for seven years. "He's a listener. He's a facilitator and he's a very strong 
believer in not interfering with how people do their jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 His deft management skills have won him praise from other administrators in 
the county.  
</P>
<P>
 Grant Brimhall, city manager of Thousand Oaks, refers to Wittenberg as "the 
velvet-gloved person at the helm of this county. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't be where he has been for as long as he's been there and not have 
some people upset at you," Brimhall said. "But I think there is a preponderance 
of respect and regard for his integrity."

CAMARILLO DEBATES VENTURA STADIUM PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal to build a minor league baseball stadium in Ventura was debated 
before the Camarillo City Council Wednesday night, with some fans urging the 
city to support the regional ballpark and others preferring the city save its 
money for police or other services. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo resident Harlan Snyder asked City Council members not to contribute 
public dollars to the the construction of the 5,500-seat stadium, reminding 
them that it could leave the city burdened with long-term debt. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would put us in a state of bonded indebtedness that the city could never 
afford," Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jim Colborn, a former pitcher for the Kansas City Royals and a Ventura 
resident, spoke in favor of the city helping with the ballpark's $15.6-million 
construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Modern minor league baseball is like going to a ballgame at Disneyland," 
Colborn said. "It's safe, clean and magical." 
</P>
<P>
 The council was asked Wednesday to decide whether the new stadium should be 
built on a parcel near the Ventura Auto Mall. Camarillo is considering 
developing the ballpark jointly with the cities of Ventura and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 But some Camarillo council members have said it was unfair to expect Camarillo 
-- with its smaller population -- to pay the same portion of the construction 
cost as the other two cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the proposal is modified, Camarillo would have to pay one-third of the 
stadium's construction cost, or about $600,000 a year. It would also have to 
cover part of the operating deficit if the ball club lost money, City Manager 
Bill Little said in a report to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any problems with a stadium being built, I just have problems 
with the way it is proposed to be financed," Councilman David Smith said before 
the meeting. "I cannot see how I could support this project the way it is 
currently structured." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Charlotte Craven, perhaps the project's most vocal critic, said 
she opposed the idea of publicly financing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is the kind of facility that should be privately financed," 
Craven said. "I think baseball stadiums are fine, but keeping libraries open 
and making sure that we continue to provide other city services to our 
residents has got to take a priority." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Ken Gose, the city's representative on the three-city stadium committee, 
told his colleagues that it is the role of local government to provide 
wholesome family recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would be a complex that would serve the recreational needs of all people 
and of all backgrounds," Gose said. "I believe this is something that would 
bring us together." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, the Ventura City Council unanimously supported the ballpark's proposed 
Ventura location. 
</P>
<P>
 Then on Tuesday, the Oxnard City Council also voted unanimously to support the 
Ventura site, but voiced concerns on costs and traffic -- especially since two 
nearby Ventura Freeway interchanges are already among the county's most 
congested. 
</P>
<P>
 With Camarillo's endorsement of the Ventura site, the three cities must next 
decide whether to form a joint powers authority to govern the sports complex. A 
proposed Tri-Cities Sports Authority would own and operate the facility, 
sharing its costs and profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, an official of the California League promised to deliver a 
Class-A baseball club should a new stadium be built. The three cities spent 
about $85,000 to hire the Spectrum Group, an experienced sports consulting 
firm, to study the proposal.

PANEL TO SEEK $220,000 FOR 2 LIBRARIES; VENTURA: THE BOARD AGREES TO ASK THE 
CITY FOR THE FUNDS AND DECIDES AGAINST URGING CLOSURE OF A POPULAR EASTSIDE 
BRANCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Under a barrage of protests from eastside book lovers, Ventura's Library Board 
decided Wednesday not to recommended closure of H.P. Wright, the city's most 
popular library and the one that serves Ventura's east end. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the board agreed to ask the City Council for $220,000 over two years 
to open both H.P. Wright and the city's main reference library, E.P. Foster, 
for many more hours than they are now. Neither library is open more than 20 
hours a week now because of budget problems. 
</P>
<P>
 A second request for $75,000 would pay for automatic checkout machines at H.P. 
Wright near Ventura College -- a move board members said would speed checkout 
and cut employee costs. 
</P>
<P>
 As a long-range solution to nagging budget problems, the Library Board said 
the city and county -- which funds Ventura's library system -- should find a 
single central site where both Wright and Foster could be consolidated. A 
possible site is a vacant furniture store at the Buenaventura Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The longterm question we need to face . . . is where this full library will 
be located," board Chairwoman Sally Weimer said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura City Councilman Steve Bennett told Library Board members and 
patrons that they should not count on the city to solve the financial problems 
of the county library system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be very surprised if the council said, 'Yep, let's do this,' " he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's head librarian, Dixie Adeniran, suggested last week closing H.P. 
Wright and moving its 97,000 books to E.P. Foster in the city's downtown, so at 
least one Ventura library could be open full time. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting partly on the head librarian's urging, the Library Board agreed to 
consider the issue. But last night, Adeniran suggested the three-pronged 
solution that the advisory library board embraced, 5 to 2. 
</P>
<P>
 The two libraries now share a 10-person staff. With the two facilities merged, 
staff members would not have to shuttle back and forth and E.P. Foster would 
have an annual budget of $1.45 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But H.P. Wright is far more popular with readers, circulating nearly 225,000 
books a year, while E.P. Foster checks out 107,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-member Library Board will send its recommendation to the City 
Council, which could then make its own proposal to the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday afternoon, residents scanning the H.P. Wright shelves for books said 
they could not believe anyone would consider closing down their neighborhood 
landmark. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is a big, big mistake," said a frowning Matt Jayich, 71, flipping 
through a stack of books. If the county won't pay the extra money, he said, the 
city should ante up. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife and I were talking about this at lunch," he fumed. "(The City 
Council) is willing to go out and spend $15 million on a stupid ballpark when 
the kids are running out of books. Why would they need a reference library way 
downtown? The schools are here."  
</P>
<P>
 Some Ventura council members agree that the city might have to step in and 
help its three libraries -- including one on Ventura Avenue -- through the 
current crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we ought to reach into our pocket," Councilman Jim Monahan said. "If 
we can find the money somehow to do it, let's do it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Jack Tingstrom protested that the city should not take on a 
county burden. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the county hasn't stepped up to this issue. They are ducking their 
whole responsibility," he said, his voice rising in frustration. "They know 
darn well that people will run to their cities to complain. But I can't even 
afford my own Police Department. (Residents) are barking up the wrong tree."  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the county has found extra funds for its library system. Drastic 
funding cuts by the state means the county now receives only $5 million a year 
to operate its 16 libraries. Just to keep a bare-bones operation in place, the 
county has subsidized that budget with $1.6 million a year the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the county cannot afford to keep its libraries in Camarillo, Fillmore, 
Simi Valley, Moorpark, Ojai, Port Hueneme and Ventura open more than half the 
week, library officials said. Thousand Oaks, Oxnard and Santa Paula have their 
own library systems. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, a community group paid to install automatic checkout machines 
at the city's one library, significantly reducing the amount of staff members 
needed. That and other measures have increased library hours from 32 to 43 a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ojai, the city donated $30,000 this year to keep its library open 46 hours 
a week, far more than proposed by the county. 
</P>
<P>
 And last year in Ventura, with the city pitching in $15,000, residents raised 
$52,000 through a telethon and enabled the tiny Avenue Library to remain open 
part time through June, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 H.P. Wright is open Mondays from 2 to 8 p.m., Wednesdays from noon to 6 p.m. 
and Saturdays from 1 to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The 133,000-volume E.P. Foster facility is open Tuesdays from noon to 8 p.m., 
Thursdays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 1 to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is confusing because readers consistently come on days when the 
libraries are closed, and grow frustrated, board members said Wednesday.

COUNTY'S TOP EXECUTIVE TO STEP DOWN; GOVERNMENT: RICHARD WITTENBERG WILL TAKE A 
SIMILAR POST IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. THE ANNOUNCEMENT STUNS OFFICIALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After leading Ventura County through almost two decades of tight budgets and 
tumultuous growth, chief administrator Richard Wittenberg announced Wednesday 
that he will leave his job by the end of January to become the top executive in 
Santa Clara County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just felt I probably have seven or eight more good years," said Wittenberg, 
54. "And I'd like to be challenged in a more complex organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Before his departure, Wittenberg said, he will focus on helping the county's 
two newly elected supervisors adjust to their jobs and will stay involved with 
the county lobbying group formed to fight the closure of Point Mugu Naval Air 
Station -- the BRAC '95 Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some county officials were aware that Wittenberg was considering a 
move, they were just as surprised as members of his staff by the announcement 
that he had actually accepted a new job. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like I was hit in the stomach with an unexpected blow," said 
Supervisor Maggie Kildee. "And yet, I knew it was possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maria VanderKolk said she first learned of Wittenberg's departure 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked," VanderKolk said. "He's been in the county for so long. I 
guess I always had a mental picture of him being here always. This is such an 
enormous change going to a new place. I never thought he'd do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Other officials expressed concern that Wittenberg will be leaving his job just 
as two newly elected supervisors take office in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just adds more uncertainty to the future," said county budget manager Bert 
Bigler, one of Wittenberg's deputies. "Change does that." 
</P>
<P>
 But Supervisor Vicky Howard, who is stepping down at the end of the year after 
one term, said that Simi Valley Councilwoman Judy Mikels and Thousand Oaks 
Councilman Frank Schillo -- the county's two incoming supervisors -- are 
experienced government officials who will bring stability to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are probably going to be some rough edges for a while, but we'll 
survive," Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 A top candidate for chief executive in other large counties for years, 
Wittenberg said he twice turned down solicitations to apply for the San Jose 
job, but consented in August. He will replace Sally Reed, who left the Santa 
Clara job last year to become chief administrative officer of Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Wittenberg, who has been Ventura County's top executive since 1978, said he 
will be paid about $150,000 annually for running California's fourth-largest 
county, up from $123,000 here. A Democrat who often worked with a conservative 
board in Ventura County, Wittenberg will be working with at least four 
Democratic supervisors in his new job. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clara County is an urban county south of San Francisco with a population 
of about 1.5 million and a budget of $1.8 billion, about twice the size of 
Ventura County in both areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he will be receiving a large pay raise, Wittenberg said money was not 
a factor in his decision to leave Ventura County after 16 years as a county 
manager. Nor did he feel political pressure to leave, despite a persistent 
quarrel with county law enforcement officials over their budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here a long time," said Wittenberg, a boss known for both his firm 
administrative hand and his ability to get along with his five superiors. "I 
love this place . . . but I have the gnawing feeling that it's the appropriate 
time to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, VanderKolk said that an ongoing feud with District Atty. Michael D. 
Bradbury and Sheriff Larry Carpenter over the distribution of sales tax dollars 
generated from Proposition 172 may have influenced Wittenberg's decision to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury and Carpenter last month launched a petition drive to ensure that all 
revenues from the voter-approved ballot measure are spent solely on public 
safety services. That action was in direct response to the Board of 
Supervisors' decision earlier this year to allocate more than $1 million in 
Proposition 172 funds to departments outside public safety, and to leave 
another $4 million in revenues undesignated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the whole issue of Proposition 172 and the animosity that resulted 
from it, and knowing that was not going to go away may have played a part in 
his decision," VanderKolk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, not everyone shed tears Wednesday over Wittenberg's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Hammitt, head of the county employees' union, said, "I think he's been 
very effective in what he's done, effective from the standpoint that he's 
always balanced the budget. But I think in a combination of decisions he's 
made, the citizens of Ventura County in the end have been shortchanged." 
</P>
<P>
 Hammitt said Wittenberg and the Board of Supervisors had repeatedly made deep 
budget cuts to county departments over the years, while socking away millions 
as a hedge against feared liability. He said those cuts had demoralized county 
employees and department heads, and gave the impression that the county is 
poorly run. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wittenberg has long enjoyed a reputation as a top administrator, which is 
evidenced by the fact that other counties, including Los Angeles, have tried to 
hire him away on several occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ventura County has always been way up there as one of the best run counties 
in the state, and Richard has had a lot to do with that," said VanderKolk. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clara County officials said they have observed Wittenberg over the years 
on the Urban Counties Caucus and have been impressed with his management style. 
They also noted his extensive background as a Ventura County lobbyist, budget 
analyst and planning official even before he became chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's bright and commands the respect of people all over California," said 
Supervisor Zoe Lofgren. "He's not a business-as-usual type of guy. He's always 
willing to look at new and creative ways to get things done." 
</P>
<P>
 Lofgren said she is also impressed with Wittenberg's commitment to family 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very committed to programs for children, prevention programs and family 
oriented services," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clara Supervisor Ron Gonzales added that he was especially impressed by 
Wittenberg's handling of the Ventura County budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "The organization he runs has a very strong financial record. He has strong 
financial skills. His management style is one we need. He has an open and 
communicative style that I think will be warmly received here." 
</P>
<P>
 Wittenberg's new contract in Santa Clara County runs for three years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clara Supervisor Mike Honda said the board has been courting Wittenberg 
for about 14 months and hopes his fiscal skills can help the county weather 
hard times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like any other county in the state, we're looking at a pretty dismal 
financial picture," he said. "I think Ventura County's been pretty responsive 
in trying to reshape itself and still trying to deliver services. Ventura 
County has a reputation as being one of the best-run counties in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Ventura County, where agriculture is the main industry, Santa Clara 
County is home to dozens of high-tech, Silicon Valley corporations, including 
Apple Computers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose is by far the largest of the county's 15 cities, with a population of 
800,000. The population is ethnically diverse, with about a quarter of its 
residents being Latino and about a fifth Asian American. 
</P>
<P>
 Wittenberg said that although he looks forward to the challenges ahead, he has 
no plans to say goodby to Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been chief administrative officer since the Conestoga wagons came west," 
he said. "This has been my home . . . I love this county, and we're not selling 
the house, because when I retire, I'm coming back."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; TEACHER ON TRIAL IN MOLESTATION CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Camarillo church teacher befriended a fatherless Catholic schoolgirl and 
then used that friendship to lure the 12-year-old into a sexual relationship, a 
prosecutor said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In her opening statement to a Ventura County Superior Court jury, Deputy Dist. 
Atty.Saundra T. Brewer said Robert C. Rose abused his position of trust with 
the girl, who is now 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney James M. Farley declined to offer an opening statement to the 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose, 49, who taught religious education classes at St. Mary Magdalen Catholic 
Church in Camarillo, faces 10 counts of child molestation. He is accused of 
engaging in sexual acts with the girl between January and April of last year, 
including at least once inside the church hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The advances, Brewer said, began with fatherly hugs but escalated over the 
next few months to deep kisses and touching. 
</P>
<P>
 On one occasion, the prosecutor told jurors, Rose took the girl to his Port 
Hueneme office and undressed her before undressing himself and pressing up 
against her. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that moment, for the first time ever, (she) got scared," Brewer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim first told a friend that Rose had kissed and fondled her, then 
informed her mother, Brewer said. The girl, her mother and grandmother told 
officials at St. Mary Magdalen, who later alerted authorities.  
</P>
<P>
 Brewer also told jurors that another victim, a 22-year-old woman, will testify 
that she was molested by Rose when she was a child. No charges have been filed 
in that case because the statute of limitations has expired, Brewer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial is scheduled to resume this morning. JEFF McDONALD

 Anna Otis can't forget the terrifying staircase. 
</P>
<P>
 "My heart dropped into my stomach," said Otis, a state rehabilitation 
counselor for the blind in Van Nuys. "I felt like I'd probably fall and break 
my neck." 
</P>
<P>
 To get a job in England with a society for the blind in 1981, Otis took six 
months of training wearing a blindfold 40 hours a week. She was guided around 
Victoria Station, learned to use a guide dog, as well as prepare meals and 
change a fuse while sightless. 
</P>
<P>
 But the biggest challenge was learning to walk down a three-story winding 
staircase while wearing a blindfold. 
</P>
<P>
 1 
</P>
<P>
 Now, working for the California State Department of Rehabilitation -- in a job 
usually performed by those with visual impairments -- Otis helps 110 clients 
with little or no vision find jobs. Other counselors in her office on Sepulveda 
Boulevard work with people who have other disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Otis has helped such people as Billy Rose of Chatsworth, who realized he could 
be a history professor rather than a telemarketer; Nellie Lamkin of San 
Fernando, a former farm worker who spoke little English, who is now certified 
to teach preschool, and Diane Domingue, a well-educated former Van Nuys 
resident who was too dependent on other people, but who parachuted out of an 
airplane at 13,000 feet two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without Anna, none of this was possible," said Domingue, 33, who now lives in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Otis encouraged Domingue to attend a special 10-month training program where 
she was taught to live as a blind person after her retinitis pigmentosa -- 
sometimes called tunnel vision -- gradually worsened and finally took away most 
of her sight. 
</P>
<P>
 "She knows what it's like, which is very rare," Domingue said of Otis. 
Domingue, who parachuted to a celebration picnic when she had finished a 
training program, wants someday to be a career counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamkin, 40, who is legally blind because of a childhood accident, came to the 
United States from Mexico at age 7 with an aunt who wouldn't let her go to 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the dream always in my heart that I wanted to go to school," said 
Lamkin, who was admitted to the child development program at Mission College 
five years ago. State rehabilitation services got her a specially designed pair 
of glasses and a minocular telescope so she could read the blackboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing is to mature, to grow to learn a little more every 
day and not be a vegetable left behind," said Lamkin, who earned her preschool 
teaching certificate in the spring.  
</P>
<P>
 With some help from Otis, she also is learning to type and talks about getting 
a two-year college degree. 
</P>
<P>
 Laser surgery saved Rose's vision when he was a child, but later surgery for 
cataracts left him blind. 
</P>
<P>
 But thanks to Otis, being sightless has opened up a new world for Rose, 40, 
owner of a Chatsworth gift store. He said he did not enjoy reading before he 
lost his vision. But when he met Otis two years ago, she tested his 
intelligence and suggested he go back to school. 
</P>
<P>
 He is working toward a degree at Pierce College, the school he dropped out of 
20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was the main force behind my going back to school," said Rose, a former 
telemarketer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love school," said Rose, who is interested in history because of what it 
can teach about the present. "It's the funniest thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Otis uses such success stories as these to encourage her new clients, and she 
has seen a dramatic effect on blind people when they find work. "A job is such 
wonderful therapy." 
</P>
<P>
 Blindness should not stop people from getting their dream job, she said, if 
they have enough support and, perhaps, some special equipment that her 
department can arrange. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything is possible for the blind now," said Otis, "Except flying an 
airplane or driving a car."

 A 34-year-old Santa Barbara County man died Wednesday after his car swerved 
off California 33 and plunged 40 feet down an embankment into the Ventura 
River, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans workers found Beningo Mauro Bolanos of New Cuyama lying in the river 
bottom about five feet from his crashed Honda Civic about 9 a.m. Wednesday, 
Deputy Coroner Craig Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolanos was unconscious but had no marks or wounds on his body, Stevens said. 
He was taken to Ojai Valley Community Hospital and pronounced dead at 11:15 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know if he fell out of the car or crawled out," Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 California Highway Patrol officers were not certain when the accident took 
place.  
</P>
<P>
 "They found him at 9 a.m., but we have no way of knowing when the accident 
occurred," Officer Dawn Heavyside said. Bolanos apparently lost control of the 
car while driving south on the highway, she said. TRACY WILSON

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PIRU; NEW AGENCY TO HELP FINANCE REBUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paving the way for more than $1 million to rebuild the earthquake-damaged 
downtown in tiny Piru, the Ventura County Board of Supervisors have agreed to 
establish a county redevelopment agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Worried that the state Legislature would amend its redevelopment law next 
year, the board on Tuesday opted to establish the agency now so it can qualify 
as an agency even if the law is changed later. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important that we move ahead today establishing this ordinance," said 
Supervisor Maggie Kildee, who represents Piru on the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 A redevelopment agency allows local governments to designate a blighted area 
and establish a baseline for property taxes within that area. Any increased 
revenues over the years can be diverted to a special account to finance certain 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials will begin mapping out that area for the agency, which is 
expected to generate enough tax revenues to repay a bond worth between $1.3 
million and $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 That money would help rebuild downtown Piru, which suffered severe damage in 
the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Piru Neighborhood Council, which approved the plan last week, 
were pleased that supervisors agreed to establish the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have fences up from the earthquake, and we need to get some new 
businesses going," neighborhood council member Jeanne Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance, which received virtually no discussion among members of the 
board, is scheduled to go into effect next month. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; HMO STILL WORKING ON BUILDING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Needing more time to work out architectural details, Foundation Health Inc. 
officials abruptly withdrew a proposal before the Camarillo Planning Commission 
this week to build a medical complex on the city's east side. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realized that there were a few more details that needed hammering out 
before it was presented to the commission," said Kurt Davis, a company 
spokesman."We still have every intention of building in Camarillo. We just need 
a little more time." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission was set to consider approving the proposal during its meeting 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said the proposal for the 19,120-square-foot building, which is an 
effort by the health maintenance organization to retain more family practice 
physicians and to centralize services for members, will be back before the 
commission at its Dec. 6 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The project calls for the company to build a single-story building that will 
include examining rooms, X-ray laboratories and a pharmacy. The building is 
proposed for a vacant three-acre parcel near Adolfo Road and Avenida Acaso. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said health maintenance organizations such as Foundation Health have 
recently found themselves vying with other organizations to retain their 
general medical practitioners. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, about a dozen doctors under contract with the company run their 
practices out of their own facilities. Davis said the project is estimated to 
cost the company between $4 million and $5 million and could be completed by 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 Foundation Health is the largest group health care provider in Ventura County 
with more than 30,000 members. The company is considering plans to build 
similar buildings in Ventura and Oxnard, Davis said. J.E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; MEMORIAL TO HONOR SHOOTING VICTIMS

<TEXT>
<P>
 A rose garden to commemorate the victims of last year's mass murder at an 
Oxnard unemployment office will be planted outside the Ventura County 
Government Center, supervisors decided.  
</P>
<P>
 The memorial also will honor those who came to the aid of seven people who 
were killed or wounded when an unemployed computer programmer, Alan 
Winterbourne, entered the north Oxnard office and methodically began firing at 
state workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Three people died at the office last December, and an Oxnard police detective 
was killed minutes later as he pursued the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors said the decision to plant a single row of roses on each side of 
the flagpole at the main entrance to the government center was reached in a 
series of community meetings over recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 Employment Development Department worker Cathie Jimenez praised the board for 
being the first public agency in Ventura County to memorialize Winterbourne's 
four victims, including Detective James O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials plan to dedicate the rose garden Dec. 2 -- the first anniversary of 
the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the approval Tuesday was a plan to relocate the existing peace 
officers memorial from outside the County Jail to a more visible location in 
front of the Hall of Justice at the government center. 
</P>
<P>
 That plaque, which honors Ventura County officers slain in the line of duty, 
will be moved sometime next year. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; DETAILS REQUESTED ON CHARTER SCHOOL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Urged by parents to offer a public school alternative for local students, the 
Ojai school board has agreed to keep alive a proposal for what would be Ventura 
County's first charter school. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees gave former teacher Deanna Nakosteen up to six weeks to give them 
more details about her proposed Discovery Charter School -- which would be 
publicly funded but free from the constraints of state education code. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision came at a Tuesday meeting packed with about 45 of Nakosteen's 
supporters, many of them parents whose children attended a now-defunct private 
school run by Nakosteen. 
</P>
<P>
 Although parents praised Nakosteen's teaching ability, Ojai school officials 
said they are concerned the proposed school fails to meet the requirements of 
the 1992 charter school law. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, drawn up in response to parent demands for more choice in the public 
schools, gives charter schools control over their own finances by allowing them 
to receive funding directly from the state. 
</P>
<P>
 But the law says only existing public schools or new, start-up schools may 
become charter schools: Private schools may not convert to charter status. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai Supt. Andrew Smidt said Nakosteen's proposed school may be just a 
conversion of her former private school -- called Discovery Place -- to charter 
status. The school folded in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Smidt also raised concerns about how Nakosteen's school would serve disabled 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 But David Patterson, a state Department of Education consultant, said other 
charter schools are based on the educational methods used at private schools. 
The state would not consider Nakosteen's proposal to violate the charter school 
law, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson said some charter schools pay the local district to allow disabled 
students to take part in the district's special education programs. MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; MAN ROBS 2ND BANK WITHIN A MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO FO Suspect in Oxnard bank robbery 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The FBI is searching for a man who on Wednesday robbed his second bank in 
Oxnard within the past month. 
</P>
<P>
 The robber, described as a Latino in his 20s with a light mustache, walked 
into a Bank of America branch on A Street in downtown Oxnard about 9:30 a.m. 
with a brown bag, told the teller that he had a pistol and handed over a note 
demanding money, said FBI Special Agent Larry Dick. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did it in such a way that no one noticed what was happening," Dick said. 
"Only one bank worker was aware that a robbery was taking place."  
</P>
<P>
 FBI agents quickly determined that Wednesday's robber was the same man who 
held up a Bank of America on Saviers Road on Oct. 26, because the descriptions 
given by witnesses, the words used to ask for money and the notes all matched, 
Dick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, surveillance cameras captured several clear shots of the man 
during each holdup. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick declined to say how much money the man had robbed or what he said to the 
tellers when asking for money. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of America officials were not available for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbery was the 21st of the year in the county, Dick said. There were 45 
robberies in all of 1993. MIGUEL BUSTILLOFO Suspect in Oxnard bank robbery

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SAVING NAVY BASES FOCUS OF OPEN HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A task force of local leaders preparing to defend Ventura County's two Navy 
bases against potential closure will hold an open house Friday afternoon at the 
group's office near the Camarillo Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The BRAC 95 Task Force is expecting as many as 200 people to drop by its 
county-donated office space and hear various strategies to prevent the closure 
of Navy bases at Point Mugu and Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be the big kickoff of what we're trying to do," said Bill 
Simmons, the task force's coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense contractors, business leaders and local officials formed the task 
force to make sure neither of the county's bases is targeted during next year's 
round of base closures. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the group has raised about $200,000 in public and private donations, 
hired a high-powered Washington, D.C., lobbyist and is planning to send a 
delegation to the nation's capital next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-hour open house begins at 4 p.m. Friday in the office building at 555 
Airport Way, near the Camarillo Airport. For more information, call 388-4481.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: TASK FORCE CREATING REGIONAL ALLIANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County task force is working to create a regional alliance comprised 
of city, county, business and education leaders to promote area assets and 
tackle local problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The Council on Economic Vitality, made up of public and private officials, 
plans to kick off the alliance during its yearly summit in January, said Nancy 
Williams of the Ventura County Economic Development Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 10 very diverse cities in this county," Williams said. "But we have a 
lot of things in common as well. We're one of the few counties that can come 
together on things." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Alliance, which will meet for the first time in January, 
would look for ways to convert defense industries, create a regional marketing 
campaign to attract business and tourists, and work to establish a better 
countywide telecommunications base. 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership would be modeled after Silicon Valley's Smart Valley group and 
a similar alliance in New Brunswick, Canada. Agencies would provide funding 
based on their level of participation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty leaders from businesses and nonprofit organizations have pledged to take 
part. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said the county and all 10 cities are expected to participate in the 
alliance, although some may become more involved than others. She added that 
the partnership would not diminish competition among cities for business, but 
will help the entire county grow.  
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to take away from the competition, but you want to establish 
things that you can work together on," Williams said. "You want to avoid 
situations like the current one where two aquariums are being proposed." MIGUEL 
BUSTILLO

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; RESIDENTS GET CITY TO OK SPEED BUMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As all five City Council members hit the "yes" buttons to approve a set of 
seven speed bumps on Calle Tulipan in Thousand Oaks, a group of homeowners from 
the residential street cheered and applauded. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents had been asking for speed bumps on the street between Avenida de 
Las Plantas and Avenida de Los Aroboles for more than a year, but traffic 
studies showed average daily flow of cars on the street was too low to warrant 
the traffic-slowing devices. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing public testimony at a meeting last month, the city's Traffic and 
Transportation Commission recommended that the bumps be installed. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 75% of residents along the street had signed a petition requesting 
the bumps. 
</P>
<P>
 "People get off that freeway (California 23) and they are flying," resident 
Jack Wood told the council at Tuesday night's meeting. "They have the mentality 
that they are still on the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Judy Lazar said she was concerned that installing the bumps on 
Calle Tulipan could increase traffic on nearby Calle Bouganvilla, where Park 
Oaks School is located. 
</P>
<P>
 The council asked that traffic patterns on that street be monitored by staff 
and that letters be sent to residents of Calle Bouganvilla to notify them about 
the bumps on neighboring street. MARY F. POLS

MERCHANTS PRESS TO REVIVE CRIME WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alarmed by escalating crime and confrontations with transients, downtown 
Ventura merchants have jump-started a crime watch program aimed at forcing 
police to restore foot patrols in the business district. 
</P>
<P>
 Shopkeepers say petty theft, burglaries and other problems have risen steadily 
since budget cuts forced cancellation early this year of the full-time police 
patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tired of it," said business owner Bonnie Convey, one of about two dozen 
merchants who gathered Wednesday night to talk to police and city officials 
about the problems downtown. "This malicious damage is driving us out of 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 Of primary concern, merchants said, is a growing, more violent group of 
homeless people living in the Ventura River bottom and other downtown areas. 
Merchants say many of the transients hang out downtown, panhandling and scaring 
off customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the foot patrol was here it made a difference," said Dee Frisbie, a 
downtown merchant who led the push to re-establish the crime watch program. 
"We're striking back and fighting for what we want. We just want people to feel 
safe to come downtown." 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants acknowledge that their own lack of involvement hasn't helped the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, merchants met regularly to discuss crime and other problems in the 
downtown area. But as attendance dropped off, merchants say the downtown began 
to be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, at the start of the year, the daily foot patrols were disbanded in 
favor of a weekend patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question that when we had the downtown foot patrols, those folks 
were less noticeable," shopkeeper Chuck Voigtsberger said before Wednesday 
night's meeting. "When the city decided that they didn't have the money for 
foot patrols, they became more visible." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members who attended the Wednesday night meeting said they would do 
what they could to address the merchants' concerns, noting that the council is 
scheduled to discuss police staffing next week. And police said they will do 
whatever the City Council wants. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the City Council directs us to give you a foot patrol back, then you're 
going to get a foot patrol," Capt. Randy Adams told the merchants.

EXPERT REVISES TESTIMONY ON FATAL SHOOTING OF O'SULLIVAN; COURTS: WITNESS 
CONCEDES THE WESTLAKE NURSE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN ON HER KNEES WHEN SHE WAS 
KILLED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Under intense cross-examination, a ballistics expert testifying against murder 
defendant Mark Scott Thornton conceded Wednesday that Westlake nurse Kellie 
O'Sullivan might not have been on her knees when she was fatally shot. 
</P>
<P>
 A day earlier, Paul Dougherty had said that the nurse was on her knees and 
unable to put up a struggle when she was shot under leafy tree limbs in the 
Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged in Ventura County Superior Court on Wednesday, however, that 
his interpretation of the slaying is based on speculation -- although he said 
he still believes it is accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe she was shot right where she dropped," testified Dougherty, who at 
times appeared irritated under questioning from Deputy Public Defender Howard 
J. Asher. 
</P>
<P>
 Dougherty also told the attorney for the 20-year-old defendant that his 
re-enactment of the crime, aided by the use of a mannequin dressed in 
O'Sullivan's soiled nurse's uniform, will probably have to suffice unless a 
witness to the killing surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
 The acrimonious exchange came during an unusually bizarre day in Thornton's 
3-week-old murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 At 10:09 a.m., in the middle of Dougherty's testimony, the lights in the 
courtroom went out for about 15 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinarily, a backup generator would kick in within a second or two of a power 
outage, a court security official said. But that did not happen Wednesday, 
causing a brief scramble for security personnel guarding Thornton. 
</P>
<P>
 As everyone sat silent in darkness for about five seconds, bailiff John 
Christie grabbed a flashlight and shone it on the unshackled and apparently 
unfazed defendant, who sat calmly at the table. Another guard raced over to 
Thornton and stood behind him until power was restored. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton never moved, except to swivel in his chair and look around the 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 After the blackout, Superior Court Judge Charles McGrath resumed the trial 
without a recess. The outage affected the entire Hall of Justice and parts of 
east Ventura, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 To counter any damage done to their theory of murder on cross-examination, 
prosecutors used a mannequin dressed in O'Sullivan's soiled nurse's uniform to 
reconstruct the shooting. Dougherty had employed the mannequin during his 
testimony on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dougherty also reiterated that he based his re-enactment on the position of 
the nurse's body when it was found and on the fact that the low-hanging foliage 
would not have given her much room to stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Wednesday, prosecutors called one of Thornton's former girlfriends to 
the stand. Erika Schroeder, now a 19-year-old college student, testified that 
she dated the defendant for more than a year before breaking off their 
relationship in the fall of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She testified that Thornton had threatened to kill her and anyone she dated. 
After their final date to homecoming at Thousand Oaks High School in October, 
1992, Thornton drove her through the Santa Monica Mountains and then to Malibu 
Beach, where Schroeder said he threatened to kill her and then himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, he showed up at her Glendale home and kidnaped her for about an 
hour. "He asked how it would feel if he took me to a place where no one would 
ever find me," she testified. He also hit her in the face, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she had started dating him when the two of them attended Hoover High 
School in Glendale because she considered him cute. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning I was in love with him," Schroeder said. "But towards the 
end, I was only with him because I was scared to break up with him."

AROUND THE VALLEY: FEEDING THE BODY AND FEEDING THE SPIRIT, THE REST OF THE 
YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOCELYN Y. STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every year, right around this time, something strange starts to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 We remember that people have to eat -- and we feed them. 
</P>
<P>
 From now until the holiday season ends, people who are poor, or homeless, or 
very ill, or very old and lonely will sit down to festive turkey dinners held 
in their honor or receive baskets of free food. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the needy eat well this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, hunger has an annoying habit of showing up at inopportune times 
-- like during the other 10 months of the year, when the Yuletide spirit has 
worn off and most people have retreated to their own woes. 
</P>
<P>
 The hungry will be hungry again after the Christmas lights have been packed up 
and the last strains of "Auld Lang Syne" have drifted away. 
</P>
<P>
 And who feeds them then?  
</P>
<P>
 People like June Spahr of Granada Hills and Ada Robinson of Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 This brisk autumn day, Spahr's white minivan is packed with her three kids, 
several bags of food and one reporter. Driving along the streets of Sun Valley, 
Spahr talks about the people she has come to know in her 2 1/2 years as a 
volunteer for Project Angel Food, a food-delivery service for homebound people 
with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, if I'm going to reach out to people, I do it with food," she says 
after packing her van with specially prepared meals. "So this is a natural for 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Often the people she takes food to are so ill they can't go grocery shopping, 
or cook for themselves, or even answer the front door when she arrives. Some 
just want her to bring the food and leave. Others need to talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I like," she says.  
</P>
<P>
 On days like this when they are not in school, her children ride along, 
helping to find the houses on the route sheet and taking turns carrying the 
food. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristina, 11, and 9-year-old twins D. J. and Garrett, sit in the back seats of 
the van talking about people on the route like they were old friends. 
</P>
<P>
 There's Bill, who once gave them a stuffed animal so big it wouldn't fit in 
the van. There was David, who let them play hide-and-seek and slide down the 
stairs in his house. 
</P>
<P>
 That was fun, "except you get carpet burn," Garrett said, smiling and rubbing 
his stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made us a needlepoint," Kristina added. "He was great." 
</P>
<P>
 David died last year, around this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd asked him to give me something of his life to keep in mine," Spahr said. 
"It's hard, because you see a lot of people come and go."  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes by then, they have become more than clients -- they are friends. And 
while the food brings them together, they are bound by much more. 
</P>
<P>
 The people at Angel Food say they are always in need of volunteers who can 
deliver meals. But there is never a shortage of people who need help. Always 
there are new people to replace the ones who die -- new people who are ill and 
need food, too. 
</P>
<P>
 When a new person is added to Spahr's list, the first task is finding them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can get lost in my driveway, " Spahr laughs. "Since I was small I have had 
no sense of direction."  
</P>
<P>
 "Seriously," Kristina agrees. "My brothers and I are used to this." 
</P>
<P>
 Spahr hopes that they will grow accustomed to other things too, like the idea 
of sharing "the gifts of life." 
</P>
<P>
 Their van stops in front of Mario's house and everybody gets out. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario is sitting in a recliner dressed in a robe with a scarf wrapped around 
his neck. Spahr hugs him. The children greet him. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look much better," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I really?" Mario asks. 
</P>
<P>
 For 2 1/2 years June has delivered food to Mario, before the illness made him 
so weak and left him blind. She always stays to talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's the first, and the very best," Mario says. "It's nice to have somebody 
to look forward to." 
</P>
<P>
 People who live in the Hansen Dam area look forward to Ada Robinson, who for 
five years has fed the homeless who sleep there. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody calls her Mother Robinson. She has arthritis, walks with a cane and 
speaks her truth plainly. At 83, she can no longer lift the heavy pots she used 
to fill with black-eyed peas and collard greens. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mother Robinson can still give orders and after one conversation with her, 
you know people listen and obey. 
</P>
<P>
 "People tell me I'm too old to be doing this," she said, standing in her 
Pacoima garage, filled with bread, canned goods and other food for the homeless 
that she solicits from donors. "Listen, they didn't give me this job. I got 
news for you, God give me this job." 
</P>
<P>
 So every Thursday, she does the job God gave her, driving out to Hansen Dam 
with a few helpers. On a small hill, they set up shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaning on her wooden cane, she rattles off the names of her faithful helpers, 
like Santa taking an elf roll call. "Aileen, she cooks for me, Ora, Hilda, 
Christine, Thelma, they all help," she said. "Honey, I make it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Last week a lady come up and she says, 'Oh, it's raining, it's raining, 
Mother Robinson,' " suggesting they shouldn't go out with the weather so bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'What's wrong with that?' I said, 'Ain't you gonna eat today? Those 
folks gotta eat too.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Thankfully there are people like the Spahr family and Ada Robinson, and 
organizations and churches who deliver meals and hope to people who otherwise 
would have neither, except maybe around the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 There's something special about seeing the spirit of giving in people's lives 
even when there's no holiday around. 
</P>
<P>
 That should make us all feel merry.

FENCE-MENDING NOT ON THE AGENDA; THOUSAND OAKS: NEIGHBORS TELL THE COUNCIL THAT 
PROBST ESTATE'S WROUGHT-IRON BARRIER MAY VIOLATE PERMIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For something temporary, the wrought-iron fence being built at millionaire 
Charles Probst's Thousand Oaks estate looks as though it could last for 
centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 With thick metal posts reinforced in cement and looming about eight feet above 
the ground, this is no white picket fence. 
</P>
<P>
 What it is, according to his lawyer, is a more aesthetically pleasing version 
of the chain-link fencing customarily found at construction sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Probst doesn't believe in doing things halfway," attorney Charles Cohen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 To neighbors watching the fence go up along Westlake Boulevard, the structure 
appeared to be permanent. Estimating the distance from fence to road, they said 
that if the fence is permanent, it would be a clear violation of the setbacks 
allowed by a permit the city gave Probst last month to develop his property. 
</P>
<P>
 The permit was granted just days after the reclusive millionaire donated $2 
million to the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza. Angry residents charged that the 
council's decision was influenced by the donation. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, a month after Probst won approval for his unorthodox plan to develop 
open space in Thousand Oaks, he once again found himself the topic of 
discussion at a City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 If the fence remains in place, it would violate restrictions of the permit, 
which allows for a wrought-iron fence set back 35 feet from Westlake Boulevard. 
It now ranges from about six to 15 feet back from the road. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's meeting, nearby resident Cathy Schutz, a member of the Westlake 
North Property Owners Assn., advised council members that a fence was being 
erected that appeared to violate the conditions of the permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would anyone spend so much money putting up an iron fence just to protect 
a construction site? 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Probst doesn't believe that a chain-link fence would be appropriate to 
the neighborhood," Cohen said. "I would think that people in the neighborhood 
would be delighted to know that he is concerned enough about the aesthetics of 
the neighborhood to use wrought iron instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Probst is blessed enough to be able to provide this on a temporary 
basis," Cohen added. 
</P>
<P>
 That is fine with City Atty. Mark Sellers, who, nonetheless, said he wants a 
written statement that the fence is truly temporary. He said he plans to meet 
with Cohen to discuss the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not a violation until we determine that it is permanent," Sellers said. 
"We need to have something in writing." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Judy Lazar said she had been reassured that the fence is indeed 
temporary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does look like a very permanent fence from what I understand," Lazar said. 
"But as long as Mr. Probst understands that it can't be permanent, that is all 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Wednesday, Schutz said she and other members of the 
homeowners' association will be satisfied as long as the fence is eventually 
moved back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to blow this out of proportion," Schutz said. "But when the 
major modification was granted, the conditions were clear and specific. 
Unfortunately, the first thing that happens is a violation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it is going to be moved, that's OK. It's just that it is not a temporary 
fence that you would normally see," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Probst's landscapers are done putting in the 900 trees and maintenance 
bunker that his plan calls for, Cohen said the temporary fence will be torn 
down and a permanent replacement built at the required setback. 
</P>
<P>
 "With rain and all, the construction could go until mid-July," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the fence is not removed when construction is completed, Probst could face 
fines of up to $1,000 a day, Sellers said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to local fence builders, Probst's wrought-iron fence is probably 
costing about three times as much as a simple chain-link fence.

HEARING DELAYED IN FREEWAY SIGN LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A court hearing that was scheduled Wednesday in a lawsuit filed against Agoura 
Hills by 12 businesses over the issue of freeway signs has been postponed, 
according to an attorney for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 A clerk in Van Nuys Superior Court postponed the hearing until Feb. 15 at 9 
a.m., said Mitchell Abbott, an attorney for Richards, Watson & Gershon. 
</P>
<P>
 No reason was given for the delay, Abbott said, but apparently it was caused 
by "an internal glitch with court staff." 
</P>
<P>
 The businesses have sued the city to win the right to keep their freeway 
signs, which the city outlawed as eyesores in 1985. The businesses -- which 
were supposed to have removed their signs by March, 1992 -- have balked, saying 
they will lose business if the signs come down. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott said that while the city is not happy over the delay, the city will 
wait to get a judge's ruling before taking future action. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we forced them to take down the signs now, and later, if it turns out the 
ordinance was not valid, the city could be held liable for the cost of putting 
the signs back up," he said. "And that is a risk most cities do not want to 
take." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials argue that they acted at the behest of residents -- who have 
overwhelmingly backed the ordinance in two referendums since the ordinance was 
passed -- when the approved the sign ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12 firms involved in the suit are Chevron, Unocal, Burger King, Texaco, 
Lumber City, Fence Factory, Roadside Lumber and Hardware, McDonald's Denny's, 
Jack-in-the-Box, Horse Trailers International and Mobil. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Aran, an attorney who represents some of the freeway sign owners, said 
the California Business and Professions Code -- which he helped write -- allows 
businesses to have such signs if they need them to attract business. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott says the code is irrelevant because it deals with size and height 
issues. The city, Abbott notes, is not attempting to regulate the signs' height 
or size, but wants to remove them altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 The pole sign issue has also created controversy in Calabasas, where the 
Planning Commission recently ordered two businesses, Calabasas Mobil and Red 
Robin restaurant, to remove their non-complying pole signs within 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs violate a city ordinance prohibiting signs higher than 60 feet, the 
commission ruled. The two were invited to apply for permits for 42-foot signs. 
They have the right to appeal the Planning Commission's decision to the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent case was settled amicably. In May, the City of Agoura Hills 
announced an agreement with Shell Oil, in which the company will take down a 
70-foot pole sign in exchange for permits to build a carwash and mini-mart.

SOUTHERN SECTION WATER POLO PLAYOFFS; MARINA DEFENSE LEADS VICTORY 
</P>

<P>
 Marina put in its bid for the Division II water polo title with an 11-5 upset 
over third-seeded Costa Mesa in the quarterfinals Wednesday at Golden West 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings (18-11) advance to the semifinals, where they will play 
Servite.The Friars dumped Marina, 18-6, this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina Coach John Wright said if his team can repeat its effort against the 
Mustangs, he likes the Vikings' chances on Saturday against the second-seeded 
Friars. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we play like this we can win our division," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright pointed to the defense, particularly goalkeeper Darin Smith, who saved 
11 shots, as the primary reason for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were super defensively," he said. "It was one of our best defensive 
efforts this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Erik Larson's man-advantage goal gave Marina a 1-0 lead after one quarter and 
the Vikings stretched it to 6-2 by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 The second quarter was capped by Robin Beauregard, who freed herself from the 
defense and slammed a shot past goalkeeper Justin Taylor with eight seconds 
left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Stever O'Rourke scored twice for Marina to open the second half and the 
Vikings led, 8-3, after three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa (23-5) got no closer than 10-4 in the fourth quarter as Smith had 
six saves and Dan Kreamer had three steals. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina was led by O'Rourke's four goals. Robert Grayeli had four goals for 
Costa Mesa, which lost in the finals last season. DAN ARRITT

FIRST PERSON: OFF TO PLACES NOT MEASURED IN MILES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The pathetic signs of a sad obsession were there for anyone to see. Anyone not 
blinded by well-polished chrome. 
</P>
<P>
 I parked my new-to-me 16-year-old Harley in the living room/bedroom/dining 
room/kitchen of my one-room apartment. And still clamped on a padlock. 
</P>
<P>
 I started the bike just to hear its unfathomably dark and deep cant, shutting 
my eyes and rolling my head around as though the motorcycle were belching 
Mozart's Requiem. Then I shut off the engine and went to bed. 
</P>
<P>
 I knelt at its gearbox at 2 in the morning, shivering almost uncontrollably in 
the cold, painstakingly scrubbing oil residue from the tailpipes -- with a 
toothbrush. 
</P>
<P>
 My only excuse? It's my first Harley. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in my defense, there was a reason for the late-hour toothbrushing. The 
Love Ride was just hours away, and damned if I was going to be the only one of 
20,000 riders with unflossed pipes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is, I had been a bit nervous about joining the most massive mob of 
potentially bad-ass bikers ever assembled in the free world -- or assembled to 
raise funds for charity, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, my bike is the baby of Harleys: a Sportster, known in Harley 
parlance as a "Sporty," a term that always makes me grimace. Not to be too 
Freudian about it, but even with a 1,000cc engine it is considered small. And 
mine is a '78, built at the nadir of quality control at Harley-Davidson. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe I will be mocked, I thought. Maybe I will be scorned. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, I have no beard. No ponytail (although I did in college, I sometimes 
feel compelled to point out to those asking about my Sporty). No beer belly 
worth bragging about. These grooming and fitness attributes, especially the 
suck-in-able gut, might garner bonus points in some circles, but I knew such 
traits would make me suspect among bikers. 
</P>
<P>
 So I customized my seat and chopped my front fender and polished my pipes 
until I could see . . . "Hey, that's stubble on my face." Admittedly not as 
threatening as a three-foot-long Texas blues-man beard, but better than 
nothing, and I felt somewhat heartened as I put down my cleaning implements for 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All the worry, all the cleaning, all the wanting for a blue-collar job were 
unnecessary, I realize as my friend Amy and I pull into the alley at 
Harley-Davidson of Glendale last Sunday. At the Love Ride, anything and 
everything, anyone and everyone goes. 
</P>
<P>
 Lime-green customized Softails with orange flames. Old police bikes. Ancient 
Fatboys. There are plenty of Sportsters here, some with pipes shinier than 
mine, some with pipes duller; some louder, some that are buried in the aural 
rubble of my combustive thunder. 
</P>
<P>
 Playmate Pamela Anderson is here -- riding behind some rock 'n' roller whose 
name escapes me and who seems slightly peeved that her name is being called out 
more often by paparazzi than his -- on a sun-yellow custom Softail worth more 
than my car, my Harley, my mountain bike (also worth more than my car) and my 
Mason jar full of change combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Judd Nelson's ride is battered and black and swathed in grease, and 
looks like I had long believed a Harley should look until somehow I got it into 
my head that a Harley must be toothbrush-clean and dipped in chrome. 
</P>
<P>
 The Soldiers for Jesus are here. So are the Hells Angels (San Fernando Valley 
chapter) and a surly looking gang of Century City attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 As we wait with some anticipation for the start, Jay Leno poses for pictures, 
somebody from "Northern Exposure" cruises the crowd. Nelson approaches and says 
something about feeling locked up here, knowing that road is so close. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy dares me to bum a smoke from him. I'm feeling daring and ask. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sorry, man," he says sincerely, "I bummed this one." We both chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time we head out through the corridor of giddy onlookers, up Interstate 
5 where men, women and children are lining the overpasses and waving wildly, 
and riders with prison tattoos wearing Prussian army helmets are waving back 
with equally good cheer, the whole damn thing is such a gas you can hardly keep 
the grin off your face. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 I had ridden motorcycles on and off since I was a teen-ager. But now I'm 28, 
and it had been two years since I garaged my last bike when an editor arrived 
at a party this summer on a blood-red Ducati, a leather-clad woman on the back. 
He pulled off his helmet and patted his graying hair, as though to extinguish 
any flames. I started shopping the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
 I was on a writer's budget. An old Yamaha Maxim, I thought, or an early '80s 
Honda; I could get something for $1,500, easy. Within a week I was agonizing 
over a spotless BMW in a spotless shop being watched by a stern seller who 
would not budge from $3,250. It was cool. Very cool, and very quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 I bought the Harley the following day from a guy with a long braid who was 
working on a pickup and slugging Miller beer when I arrived with the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "No cerveza, no trabajo ," he said in hack Spanish. His wife began to cry as I 
prepared to ride off, and she had to turn away. 
</P>
<P>
 It was mine almost before I knew it, another compulsive act to analyze later. 
But certainly the mysterious Harley magic was swirling in my subconscious when 
I handed over the fistful of hundreds: Marlon Brando in "The Wild One"; my 
after-school job at the gas station, where I thrilled to fill the rare Harley, 
obviously on its way somewhere else, protecting the airbrushed tank by catching 
any errant drops of fuel in my hand; Peter Fonda being shotgunned off his red, 
white and blue bike and into nomadic martyrdom. 
</P>
<P>
 My earlier bikes had carried me from the high desert to the coast. My Harley 
would carry me places not measured in miles. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Love Riders reached Castaic Lake, Jackson Browne took the stage. But 
even such tunes as "Runnin' on Empty" could not compete with the show in the 
VIP area. 
</P>
<P>
 In a fishnet top so loosely woven a trout could swim through, Janet Clark is 
showing off her favorite birthday present of all time: new breasts, "the 
twins," she calls them, "32 double-Ds . . . but they're still swollen so they 
might be closer to E's." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyfriend Mike Cash, who laid out $5,000 for the surgery, could not be more 
proud and encourages friends, "Go on, give her a hug!" 
</P>
<P>
 While Clark wows the crowd, I talk bikes with Peter Fonda, the easiest of the 
Easy Riders. But he suddenly halts description of his '91 Fatboy and scans the 
sea of black leather. He seems concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost my bodyguards," Fonda says. "I had three beautiful blond bodyguards." 
</P>
<P>
 At a Red Cross tent, Cathy Crawford has been mostly concerned with easing 
hangovers today, doling out the aspirin. But the first emergency has just come 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a three-inch acrylic fingernail, broken halfway down the nail bed," 
Crawford says. "I gave her a full-finger pressure bandage." 
</P>
<P>
 Something made me take the long way home from the Love Ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was the churlish groan of a highway full of Harleys, a song as sweet 
to the biker -- even a weekend road warrior -- as the crack of a wood bat is to 
the baseball fan. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was the irony of one biker's black rear fender, encouraging those who 
couldn't keep up to "read the Bible." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was because, for the first time since my arrival here six months ago, 
Los Angeles seems to have made room for one more. 
</P>
<P>
 I dropped Amy off and spent the next two hours motoring through the dark hills 
of Hollywood.

DESIGNER SPOTLIGHT: GETTING FAMILY SUPPORT; HER OWN KIDS' NEEDS HELP KAREN 
MUNROE OF N. TUSTIN KNOW WHAT WORKS FOR SOFTHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A cork bulletin board in Karen Munroe's work studio in her North Tustin home 
is plastered with sketches of dresses and colorful swatches. Equally colorful 
alongside them are crayon drawings by two of her four daughters, whose smiling 
photographs are tacked up there with everything else. 
</P>
<P>
 Across from the computer, next to a large cutting table that dominates the 
room, stands a miniature dress form. It's not unlike the kind you see in 
display windows covered with jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 Except on this form, Munroe experiments with patterns and fabrics that will 
eventually turn up in her children's wear collection,Softhead.  
</P>
<P>
 Characterized by classic silhouettes and fun novelty prints, Softhead apparel 
fits boys and girls from 6 months old to size 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't design anything very froufrou," says Munroe, who founded the company 
when her first daughter, Lauren, was born in 1989. "I just know what my 
children's needs and wants are." 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, Munroe was a new mom fretting over the harmful effects of a 
thinning ozone layer on her newborn. In search of proper protection, Munroe was 
inspired to stitch up a soft baseball cap with an extended bill. Friends and 
strangers began asking about the reversible hats. 
</P>
<P>
 Pregnant with her second daughter and not wanting to return to a demanding 
career as a traveling manufacturer systems consultant, Munroe was encouraged by 
her husband to begin Softhead hats. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for this enterprise were reinforced when a family member who represented 
a children's wear line asked to take the hats around on her circuit. The 
feedback, recalls Munroe, was thrilling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have an MBA from UCI, not a fashion degree. I learned how to sew from my 
grandmother and until then just did it on the side," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later she added matching shorts and floppy hats, and the collection has 
continued expanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Silhouettes are kept timeless and basic. "I think because I'm not a designer I 
look for simple patterns and fabrics that other mothers might like. There are a 
lot of designers who love to design beautiful things, but they don't consider 
the practical side of manufacturing," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 With four girls under age 5, Munroe knows the reality of value. She considers 
affordable prices paramount, keeping sets under $50. A reversible pant set with 
suspenders and a matching sweat shirt runs about $46 to $50; the ballet-length 
prairie dress is $42 to $46. Softhead's signature hats are $18 to $20. 
</P>
<P>
 Dresses usually fall into two categories: the two-tiered empire waist dress 
and the single-tiered empire waist. Both use a generous amount of yardage to 
allow for twirling. 
</P>
<P>
 For big boys, there are corduroy pants with a novelty print cuff that matches 
a panel of the same novelty fabric sewn on a colored sweat shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 It's Softhead's novelty prints that have attracted parents and kids most, says 
Munroe. Anything goes: cowboy hats, vegetables, cookies, the alphabet and 
animals. "I look for impact, color, nothing too cutesy. My kids, of course, 
tell me what they like," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Four-year-old Mallory agrees quickly, pausing only briefly from wiggling and 
giggling continuously in her patient mother's arms.  
</P>
<P>
 "The girls are very helpful," adds Mom. The four, including twins Kelsie and 
Jaime, ages 3, serve as models in catalogue brochures. 
</P>
<P>
 Working from home allows Munroe to spend maximum time with her family. Of 
course, a sitter comes three times a week to watch the girls so she can catch a 
few quiet hours in her workroom or run to the contractors.  
</P>
<P>
 Six sales representatives show Softhead nationwide, presenting the biannual 
collection to about 250 active accounts. Locally, it's available at the Miss 
Muffett Shoppe, Mission Viejo; Oogly Boogly, Laguna Beach; Nickle Arcade, 
Westminster; Petit Bonhomme, San Clemente, and Muffins, Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Munroe has her sights set on plaids and garden flowers for '95, she 
cautions that this is not an operation that will grow faster than her girls. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first job is as a mom. I'll keep doing this on the side -- like a hobby -- 
as long as I don't lose money."

INSIDE OUT: FASHION; POLITICS JUST AREN'T IN HIS FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA GENDEL, TIMES FASHION EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Daryl Hannah is his ideal woman. He dreams mostly in French. And his favorite 
perfume is Sun Moon Stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Who is Karl Lagerfeld?  
</P>
<P>
 Good answer! as Richard Dawson used to say. 
</P>
<P>
 Lagerfeld touched down in New York recently to promote his astrologically 
oriented fragrance, and he spoke to us by phone from his penthouse at the 
Royalton Hotel. "It really is the only place to stay. Upstairs is nice and 
quiet. Downstairs, you see everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Later that day he held a news conference to answer all those burning questions 
about fashion and fragrance. After his riot-provoking appearance at the 
Sorbonne, where students made their contempt for the frivolous world of fashion 
well-known, was Lagerfeld embarking on a career in politics? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no, no," he said emphatically. "I don't think anybody wants to be a 
politician anymore, do you? It's not very interesting and nobody likes you." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Lagerfeld isn't particularly interested in being politic. He's 
lambasted such iconic designers as Yves Saint Laurent in print; refused to 
participate in Robert Altman's fashion satire, "Pret-a-Porter" ("I like Altman, 
but I prefer to see than be in his film"), and said of his New York schedule, 
"I'm overbooked -- like a cheap model." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of models, Sun Moon Stars spokesgirl Hannah pleased Lagerfeld 
immensely by looking "even more childlike" in person than in photographs. But 
maturity can be very salable too. Lagerfeld gleefully noted that an outfit 
modeled by the legendary Veruschka at the recent Chanel show in Paris was a 
bestseller. 
</P>

 A Puff Piece: Tony Curtis immediately accused us of wanting only the 
anti-wrinkle freebie. To prove we had other motives for attending the Ethocyn 
launch Tuesday at the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills, we scurried off to talk to 
some of the 250 or so guests, including celebrities, friends of the publicist 
and investment bankers. Jill Eikenberry, mistress of ceremonies, said she 
couldn't be sure if it was the magic vials of wrinkle cream or just downtime 
that was plumping out her skin. UCLA dermatologist Dr. Richard Strick was so 
euphoric it raised a few eyebrows and caused us to wonder why Ethocyn inventor 
Chantal Burnison had such a furrowed brow. Perhaps she got it from squinting 
through a microscope for 14 years. Or maybe from answering prickly questions 
like the one tossed out by actress Rue McClanahan, who wanted to know -- as TV 
cameras rolled -- why she had been invited to the luncheon and what was 
expected of her? Well, some word-of-mouth advertising would be nice, Burnison 
meekly replied. If it works, we'll let you know.

 I, Fashion Victim: Do you believe in your heart that brown shoes go with a 
blue dress? Do you own a pair of leopard-print leggings? Is your wardrobe 
virtually indistinguishable from Zsa Zsa's? If so, step right up and let your 
fashion victimhood net you $1,500 and a commemorative plaque. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Blackwell is giving you a chance to claim the prize money and the top spot 
in a contest connected with his 35th annual Top 10 Worst-Dressed Women list. 
Fashion victims (age 18 or older, please) must send non-returnable color photos 
of themselves in all their sartorial glory to Mr. Blackwell at 505 S. Beverly 
Drive, Suite 164, Beverly Hills, Calif. 90212 by Dec. 31. The lucky winner will 
top the worst-dressed list on Jan. 10. More information: (310) 271-4755.

 I, Vendela: If you're on the other end of the food chain, the pay is better, 
of course. Vendela's people called in hushed tones, saying the supermodel was 
going to have big, big news. They're not allowed to say more, but it's big. 
Press releases are being typed, interviews scheduled by satellite.  
</P>
<P>
 So what's the big deal? Vendela signed with Almay cosmetics to an exclusive 
multiyear contract. Supermodels sign mega-contracts for millions every day, of 
course. We asked the Swedish beauty herself, what's the big deal? 
</P>
<P>
 "It was unusual to sign with a new company after six years with someone else," 
the former Elizabeth Arden model said. "It's a radical change. I'm at a 
crossroad in my life and it was important to have a change."  
</P>
<P>
 Almay, which makes inexpensive, hypoallergenic products, was also an 
understanding company. Vendela has been living in L.A. for the past three 
years, taking acting classes, and Almay said she could continue to pursue her 
acting ambitions and charity projects.  
</P>
<P>
 The Cosmetic Assn. will get a chance to check out her speaking talents Friday 
when she hosts the USC Norris breast-cancer benefit at the Regent Beverly 
Wilshire.

 Night Moves: That incredible dancing duo at the bash for Los Angeles Cities in 
Schools to launch Giorgio Beverly Hills' photo exhibit "The Magic of Play" -- 
capturing images of play by 20 renowned photographers -- sure had people 
talking. Most people figured out that the woman in the black Thierry Mugler 
suit jitterbugging like mad was Giorgio's limber president, Linda LoRe. As for 
her partner, who was nonchalantly tossing her over his hips and performing 
other amazing footwork, it turns out he was LoRe's brother Tony.  
</P>
<P>
 As children growing up in Orange County, you see, Linda and her seven siblings 
were known around the neighborhood as the "dancing LoRes." "My parents are 
great dancers too," Linda said. "That's why we all danced." The exhibit (but 
not the dancing) continues at the Directors Guild through Dec. 2.

 A Night in Milano: Eight years ago, Giorgio Armani threw an intimate dinner 
party for 250 at Downtown's Museum of Contemporary Art. On Dec. 7, the designer 
-- along with Rupert Murdoch, Lilly Tartikoff and Ronald Perelman -- will host 
a party so big (1,200 guests) and so fabulous (re-creating the garden of an 
Italian palazzo ) that it will take two Fox studio sound stages to contain it.  
</P>
<P>
 Armani is the honorary chair of the Fire & Ice Ball, a fund-raiser benefiting 
the Revlon/UCLA Women's Cancer Research Program, and he arrives here Dec. 4 to 
audition models for a show of his spring '95 men's and women's collections at 
the gala. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason he picked this charity," Armani spokeswoman Wanda McDaniel said, 
"was to recognize that women have been the lifeblood of his business." 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for the event range from $500 to $2,500. Information: Events 
Unlimited, (310) 996-1188.

FIRST PERSON: OUTSIDE, LOOKING BACK IN, IT'S ONLY HUMAN TO WONDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE GEHEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When a friend asked me to help photograph L.A. designer Richard Tyler's recent 
spring fashion show here, I didn't think twice before saying yes. It had been 
almost three years to the day since I walked into the townhouse on 59th Street 
and told my bookers at the Ford modeling agency that after an 11-year career, I 
was quitting. 
</P>
<P>
 They called it "retiring" and scarcely flinched when I proclaimed my plan to 
move to the Caribbean and open a vegetable farm. Models, after all, have poetic 
license to ponder the bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, no longer a model, I found myself backstage during the preparation for 
Tyler's show. Activities glowed under the lights of TV cameras. Long tables 
with full-length mirrors were propped sideways, teetering against makeshift 
walls, and everyone scrambled for space to do what they were there for -- work. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler had booked his share of first-tier femmes fatales. Stick-thin and 
fuchsia-clad Stephanie Seymour chatted with Tatjiana Patitz as the two sipped 
champagne in the other room. Kristen McMenamy slouched about while Nadja 
Auermann dwarfed the room with her towering blond presence. 
</P>
<P>
 What is it about this business and the people who swoon around it -- that 
takes a woman with some connection to the rest of humanity and turns her into 
an Untouchable, a Superwoman, or in this case Supermodel to be looked up to and 
emulated by the rest of civilization? 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd seemed to clear a bit and I spotted Cindy Crawford having a heart to 
heart on her cellular phone. In the super realm, the ultimate goddess award 
surely goes to Ms. Crawford Inc. She posed both ceaselessly and effortlessly. 
She found her lights and angles, but gave the illusion of being oblivious to 
the hum around her. I had seen her work before, or not work before, when we 
were booked to do the cover of Bride's magazine together. (She got the white 
dress and I got the peach bridesmaid's gown.) I had marveled then at how she 
exuded a wanton sensuality that captured the entire studio. 
</P>
<P>
 My associate came up behind me. "I'll need you stationed where we set up 
earlier. Soon." 
</P>
<P>
 I found my way through a room filled with clothes and dressers, casually 
waiting for their mannequins, and headed for the portable lavatory. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the evening I had found myself strangely detached, no consuming 
longing to be the object of the immense attention being showered on "the 
girls." So far so good. Maybe I had gone beyond the allure of all the 
paparazzi.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the desire to be Cinderella had left the fabric of my being. Yet when 
I was in the ladies room, I peered in the mirror and started taking inventory. 
Obligatory black outfit, check. Minimal makeup, check. Good bone structure, 
check. Hair, total disaster. I should have left it pulled back in a do that had 
been ironically similar to the coif du jour the hair wizard was whipping up 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Why was I looking in the mirror anyway? Glamour was no longer my job and 
comparisons at this stage in my life seemed childish. Crawford walked in and we 
locked eyes. We gave each other half-smiles as I made my way to the door. 
</P>
<P>
 The frenzied energy of the gathering crowd electrified the tent while I pushed 
and pardoned my way from backstage to the end of the catwalk. By snatching a 
security guard's unattended seat at the door, I regained my turf from 
rubbernecking onlookers. Standing on the chair and surveying the scene, it was 
obvious that everything was set. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought I heard my name: "Laurie GEHEN." I turned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ron Contarsy! How are you?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Fantastic. What are you doing taking pictures? You look fabulous! You should 
be up there," he said, pointing to the runway. 
</P>
<P>
 He had voiced the unspeakable. 
</P>
<P>
 As the models sauntered down the runway in procession, I had flashbacks of a 
particular haute couture Per Spook show I had done in 1989 at the Louvre and 
unwillingly found myself keeping score. Not "good, fair, poor," but "I could 
have done better," "not bad" and "how does she do it?!" Nadja, the model of the 
moment, pouted and puffed, with nostrils perpetually flared and lips parted to 
exactly nine millimeters as laser beam eyes wiped out entire star fleets. "Go 
girl," a fashion groupie beside me said. Girl, she was not.  
</P>
<P>
 Would the businesswoman in Chicago or the homemaker in Iowa keep this 
extravaganza in perspective and not feel the tug to look in the mirror and 
compare herself, her face, her thighs to these creatures? Can any of us, men or 
women, not have these voluptuous vixens enter our subconscious on some level 
and smile coyly at our humanness? 
</P>
<P>
 If I had my doubts whether or not I was on the right side of the camera, an 
embarrassing misstep confirmed my position. 
</P>
<P>
 The fervor peaked as the now G-string adorned models searched for their own 
clothes, Sigourny Weaver waited to speak with Richard Tyler and the fashion 
buzzards continued their assault. I saw an interesting photo opportunity in the 
making and rushed up some stairs to get the best angle. My right foot went one 
way and I went the other. 
</P>
<P>
 I wiped out in front of this mass of walking chic. Weaver blanched and I 
thought I heard someone chuckle as my colleague rushed over and helped me to my 
feet. Humble pie.  
</P>
<P>
 I told a friend about the experience the next day. "Superman doesn't trip, 
James Bond doesn't trip, but we do," he said, comfortingly. "We're humans and 
humans trip." 
</P>
<P>
 Shhhh. Don't tell the fashion world. We just might start a new trend.

FASHION / SCREEN STYLE: A FASHION STATEMENT TO CALL HER VERY OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Series: "The Susan Powter Show" (weekday mornings at 11 on KCAL, Channel 
9). 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: The nouveau-thin "Stop the Insanity" infomercial czarina chats it 
up on talk show. 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: Compared to Powter, Sally Jessy Raphael looks like Ivana Trump. But 
the nice thing about her potent concoction of white buzz cut, acrylic nails and 
incessant pairings of slacks and spike heels is that there's no confusing her 
with Marilu Henner or anyone else on the dial. 
</P>
<P>
 In That Case, Vogue Won't Be Calling: "I was desperately afraid of the 'Talk 
Show Hostess Syndrome,' where you put on the Chanel suit and have that look ," 
Powter says . "I look like a transsexual in that look anyway. Why do I have to 
have a look? I don't put on a blouse and go, 'Oh, oh, oh, I wonder if anyone 
else is doing it?' If there is any look or style at all -- and I don't presume 
there is ever -- it isn't contrived. It just is. I don't spend that much time 
thinking about it." 
</P>
<P>
 On Those Nails: "So fake, don't ask. You have a fashion exclusive -- all my 
life, I have been the worst nail-biter ever. I don't have pretty nails. I don't 
have pretty hands. I was never going to put on acrylic nails, but now I do. 
Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake." 
</P>
<P>
 On That Hair: "It's not platinum, it's white. And it's very simple. I can't 
wear fluffy stuff around the neck real well. In big prints I look like a clown 
without the wig, and I don't look good with big earrings -- I look like I came 
from a drag show." 
</P>
<P>
 On Shoes: "I have a real foot thing -- I broke both of my feet. The shoes I 
have on right now I stole from my manager's closet." 
</P>
<P>
 On Comfort: "I do care about fashion. I don't do ugly comfortable. But I can't 
be binded. The comfort thing is important. People don't get up and dress to the 
nines every day. If a skirt works, yeah. I don't do a skirt just to wear a 
skirt." 
</P>
<P>
 On Places to Shop: "I wear anything that works. I'm on my way to a discount 
mall. If I find something, I'll buy it." BETTY GOODWIN

 Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean, who first took to the ice together 20 
years ago and made an Olympic comeback with a third-place medal this year in 
Lillehammer, Norway, will appear in an exhibition Sunday at the Great Western

 Published eight years apart, these two novels by the Australian writer Kate 
Grenville deal with the same family but are told from the different 
perspectives of father and daughter. "Lilian's Story," a remarkable journey 
from childhood to madness, begins with Lilian's birth "on a wild night in the 
year of Federation," 1901, when the sparsely settled continent remained more 
stultifyingly Victorian than England itself. Writing in the first person, the 
author has succeeded in capturing every nuance of that era, re-creating a 
repressive world defined by empty ritual and hollow pretense, a milieu in which 
Lilian will never fit. 
</P>
<P>
 The daughter of a browbeaten mother who has taken refuge from her bleak 
marriage in hypochondria, and the domineering and pompous father who will 
attempt to justify himself in "Albion's Story," Lilian is at odds with her 
world from infancy. A large, intellectually precocious child, she resists every 
attempt to turn her into the prevailing vapid and docile image of Australian 
womanhood. Her mother despairs, but her father exploits her, stuffing her full 
of his beloved "facts" until she becomes a performing savant, an oddity among 
her contemporaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Excruciatingly conscious of the tensions in her family, Lilian attempts to 
please her mother and win the love of her father, a desire she's 
constitutionally unable to fulfill. By age 5, she's learned that she can 
insulate herself from her parents' dissatisfaction physically if not 
emotionally. Deliberately overeating, Lilian becomes fat, cushioning herself 
within her own body. By the time she's an adolescent, she's succeeded in 
exempting herself from the social conventions she's come to despise. 
Recognizing that Lilian is unlikely to marry, her father allows her the 
then-extraordinary privilege of attending university, where she feels 
relatively free and for the first time in her life, finds kinder spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 One way and another, her new-found friends betray and disappoint her, and her 
attempts to escape the confines of her life take increasingly radical forms. 
There is a proposal of marriage, but Lilian recognizes that her suitor is even 
more of a lost soul than she herself, though his love for her is both deep and 
genuine. She embarks upon a phase of "running wild," spending nights aimlessly 
wandering barefoot through the countryside. "My feet hardened quickly . . . 
renewed themselves endlessly. Such hide was enviable. I wondered if it could be 
encouraged to form all over a body such as mine, that had such need of armor." 
</P>
<P>
 Enraged by his daughter's defiance and determined to break her rebellious 
spirit, her father rapes her, an act that has horrendous consequences. Unable 
to endure the sight of Lilian thereafter, Albion has her committed to a mental 
hospital, where she will spend the next 10 years. Finally discharged through 
the efforts of her affectionate, alcoholic aunt, Lilian emerges from the 
institution totally unable to integrate herself into the world she'd fled. 
Instead, she lives on the streets and in the parks, accepting total alienation 
as the price of liberty. There's an interlude in prison, followed by 
incarceration in a shelter, a haven from which Lilian flees in a taxi, "Drive 
on, George, I cried at him. I am ready for whatever comes next." A powerful 
paean to individuality, "Lilian's Story" astounds the reader with style and 
substance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Albion's Story" is equally amazing: a tour de force in which the author 
speaks in the voice of the despicable Albion Singer, a pompous, smug and 
hypocritical man who fascinates even as he repels the reader. Utterly hollow, a 
man who studies others in order to memorize and imitate their reactions; a man 
seemingly devoid of human feeling, Albion manages to impersonate a successful 
businessman, a husband and a father, fooling the rest of the world but never 
himself or his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of intellect, he has "facts." In place of love, only lust. He treats 
his once winsome wife and his frail son with utter contempt, and drives the 
genuinely brilliant Lilian literally out of her mind. His story is not only a 
marvelous description of Australian society at the beginning of the 20th 
Century, but an extraordinary account of combat between the indomitable wills 
of father and daughter, a battle that forces us to redefine notions of victory. 
As Albion dies, not a moment too soon, "The nothingness within had rushed to 
join the nothingness without, and the empty husk was collapsing into itself." 
Only a remarkable writer could make a vile character so compelling. Albion is 
loathsome but entirely comprehensible.

OFF THE CUFF; EYES: FOUNDATION OF GOOD MAKEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 D esiree Tourville McDermott admits she's a little obsessed with looking good. 
It's just part of her job. McDermott works as a "cosmetician/aesthetician" at 
Salon Lujon in Fullerton, which offers complete makeup care, including 
application and styling lessons. McDermott, 32, says her fascination with 
makeup started early. In the sixth grade she was already sticking false 
eyelashes on her mother and would rag on her sisters if they left home without 
a touch-up. "I would chase after them saying, 'You need hair spray," McDermott 
recalls.  
</P>
<P>
 In high school and college, she gave her friends makeup advice. "I'd work on 
anyone who would hold still long enough," McDermott says, adding that she 
became a professional a decade ago.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Makeup in the '90s is just like fashion -- it's very individual. Hard, fast 
rules don't apply anymore. Years ago, they used to say that everyone with blue 
eyes should wear brown eye shadow. But today, there are no rules, or for every 
rule there is an exception. 
</P>
<P>
 This makes it a wonderful time because anything goes if it works for that 
person. The most important thing is to make a person feel confident. Makeup 
should enhance beauty. If you look and feel good, that's glamorous. Confidence 
is attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 With every season there are color changes, and the popular look now is a 
makeup that doesn't make someone say, "Your makeup looks great," but instead, 
"Your eyes are pretty. What nice lips," or "You look great today." The colors 
today reflect this natural look: soft, earth tones with mauve and pink rose. 
</P>
<P>
 The eyes have it. Women should put their attention there because the eyes are 
the most expressive part of the face. 
</P>
<P>
 Eyes should be enhanced with soft neutral colors -- stay away from blues and 
greens. For eye shadows, use brown shades -- depending on the woman's coloring, 
either taupes with rosewood or peach. Eyeliners should be dark brown or black, 
and there should be lots of mascara. For cheeks, use subtle colors such as 
mauve. 
</P>
<P>
 Eyebrows are really important; they are the beginning of a great look. A nice 
shape in the eyebrow frames the face and opens the eyes, making them look 
bigger and more wide-awake. Eyebrow color should be a shade lighter than a 
woman's hair color, and eyebrows should always be well groomed. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing women do wrong is wear too much makeup and not blending it all in. 
There should be no visible lines; you want everything to look natural and soft. 
But the biggest mistake women make is not being themselves, but trying to look 
like someone else. They need to know what looks good on them and what makes 
them feel comfortable. Not everyone can wear red lipstick. 
</P>
<P>
 For holiday parties, you may want to wear more makeup than usual to add a 
little excitement. Experiment with artificial eyelashes. Wear eye shadows with 
a little glitter or shine to it, which is very different from day makeup, which 
is more matte. And wine-red lipsticks are good for the holiday fashion colors.

BOOK LOOKS; "UNDERWEAR: THE FASHION HISTORY"; AUTHOR: ALISON CARTER.; INFO:

APPENDIXES, GLOSSARY AND INDEX. ILLUSTRATED.

<P>
 Sadly or refreshingly, depending on your viewpoint, this book is not nearly as 
scintillating or titillating as the topic -- or the pink satin knickers 
blooming on the cover -- might indicate. What it is, however, is a thoroughly 
researched (if surprisingly dry) history of undergarments throughout history. 
</P>
<P>
 You wouldn't believe there was this much to it, but you do have to believe 
that there can't be many camisoles left unturned in Carter's search for facts. 
</P>
<P>
 Through text and illustrations, many taken from period advertisements, Carter 
builds a chronology that is part historical survey and part sociological study. 
The years from 1490 to 1840 are given three chapters as a foundation. The rest 
of the book is divided 1840-1890, 1890-1940 and 1940-1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Each 50-year segment covers: "Outside In: The Silhouette," "Inside Out: The 
Undergarments" and "Round About: Wearing, Making and the Industry." 
</P>
<P>
 The author explains: "The aim of the 'Outside In' sections is to look at the 
outer clothes and the various layers which would have been worn beneath. . . . 
The 'Inside Out' sections take a look at accidents of survival and documentary 
evidence to draw out key characteristics of each period including a survey of 
available materials and trimmings, the cut of named garments, and how different 
named garments developed out of one another." The "Round About sections 
consider the social context of the underwear, what it was like to wear, how it 
was washed, who made it and where." 
</P>
<P>
 The focus is on women's wear, although items for men and for children are 
included as appropriate, usually for influencing a women's fashion or, more 
often, the reverse.

COVINA; UTILITY TAX SPARKS LATEST RECALL DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SULLIVAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two members of the Covina City Council, who rode into office on the wave of a 
recall drive against a previous council, received their own recall notices 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Thomas M. O'Leary, who helped lead a recall drive against the entire 
City Council last year for passing a 6% utility tax, and Thomas Falls, who 
pledged to avoid new taxes, were served with the notices Tuesday night, after 
the current council passed an 8.25% utility tax in September.Under state law, 
those seeking to recall elected officials must first notify their targets that 
a recall petition is being circulated. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Linda Sarver, also a target of the newest recall campaign, was 
absent from the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Hank Vagt, a leader in both recall campaigns, said the current council had 
promised not to enact a utility tax but, if one were thought to be needed, 
would put the tax to a public vote. "We would stop the recall tomorrow if the 
council agreed to put it on the ballot and abide by that decision," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Leary said there was no chance the council would authorize a special 
election. Legally, he said, the council cannot delegate authority to approve 
taxes to such a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members have said the tax is needed to avoid severe cuts in city 
services, such as closing the library, the Parks and Recreation Department and 
a fire station.DEBORAH SULLIVAN

CITY HALL JOURNAL: REGION; DEBATE OVER CLEANUP MAY BLOCK RACETRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By STEVE EAMES

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposed $200-million racetrack complex on the Long Beach-Signal Hill border 
may not get off the starting line because of a debate over who will pay to 
clean up contamination at the site, an oil field.  
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach and Signal Hill officials say they probably will insist that 
developers pick up the tab, estimated at $20 million to $40 million, to clean 
up the 200-acre site of the proposed racetrack, hotel and research center."It's 
pretty much a deal killer" without that stipulation, said Signal Hill 
Councilman Richard Ceccia. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Wedin, a consultant to Long Beach Grand Prix promoter Christopher Pook, 
who announced plans for the racetrack project in July, said he did not think 
the cities were insisting that the developers pay all cleanup costs. "They 
didn't go so far as to say that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But if city officials do demand that developers pay all of the cleanup costs, 
Wedin said, "I suspect that land will sit there for a long time before it's 
developed."  
</P>
<P>
 The demand that the developers bear the full cleanup cost is one of several 
being considered by Long Beach and Signal Hill officials, who are teaming up to 
review the proposal. STEVE EAMES

RECALL GROUP LOSES BATTLE FOR A RECOUNT OF PETITION; LAW: SUIT ALLEGED THAT THE 
DIAMOND BAR CITY CLERK INCORRECTLY DISCOUNTED SOME SIGNATURES. TWO COUNCIL 
MEMBERS ARE TARGETS OF CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST CLAIMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Diamond Bar citizens group that staged a recall campaign against two council 
members lost a court battle last week to win a recount of their petition. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit charged that Diamond Bar City Clerk Lynda Burgess incorrectly 
discounted a number of signatures on the petition, leaving the group short of 
the number of names it needed to hold a recall election against council members 
Gary Miller and Phyllis Papen. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 10, Pomona Superior Court Judge Burton Bach denied the request for a 
recount. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judge decided there was not enough evidence provided by proponents of the 
recall that any wrongdoing had taken place to justify a recount of the 
signatures," Burgess said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision came as a bitter blow to the recall organizers, who lost the 
recall drive by less than 1% of the 5,394 signatures needed to place the issue 
on the ballot. Furthermore, most of the signatures in question were actual 
Diamond Bar residents who were improperly registered, Burgess said. 
</P>
<P>
 Papen said she felt vindicated by the court decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a personality dispute," she said. "There was absolutely no grounds 
for a recall." 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign against Miller and Papen began last fall and alleged, among other 
things, that the two council members violated conflict of interest laws by 
voting for measures that could benefit them financially. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall proponents charged that Papen voted for a waste-hauling franchise 
in the city of Covina that benefited her live-in boyfriend, a consultant for 
one of the waste haulers, Western Waste Industries. Papen acknowledged that she 
voted for the franchise, but said she never voted for a specific permit for 
Western Waste. 
</P>
<P>
 They also maintained that Miller lied about whether he owned RNP Development 
Inc., a company that has had business before the City Council during his 
tenure. Miller, however, said documents from the Fair Political Practices 
Commission confirm that he sold the company before he assumed public office. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not one allegation that was ever proven true," Miller said. "Not one. 
They have turned me in to the district attorney, the Fair Political Practices 
Commission, and I was found innocent of all their charges." 
</P>
<P>
 Recall organizers said they were dissatisfied with the decision, and are 
considering an appeal. They contend that Burgess refused to acknowledge a 
number of valid signatures, and that she sided with Miller and Papen. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has discriminated against people, and this is their constitutional right 
to sign a petition," said Lee Schad, a member of the recall campaign. "It's not 
up to a city clerk in Diamond Bar to say 'I'll give you this one but I'll take 
this one away.' She represents the citizens of Diamond Bar, not just two City 
Council members." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Clair Harmony added: "I sense that the whole process is tainted." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Burgess said that in fact, she did not validate the signatures 
herself, but only confirmed judgments made by the County Registrar of Voters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The crux of the matter is, how in the world can I be biased if I didn't make 
the decision on the signatures, the county did!" she exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 The final number of signatures fell short by 52 names for Papen and 44 for 
Miller, Burgess said. Most of those, she said, were people who were improperly 
registered or who had moved but not re-registered at their new addresses. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Schad said some of the signatures were thrown out without warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, she said, the registrar of voters disqualified a man whose 
signature on his registration did not match that on the petition. 
</P>
<P>
 Schad said the man had suffered a stroke, which impaired his ability to write. 
</P>
<P>
 In another instance she said a father and son with the same name, who lived at 
the same address, both signed the petition but were only counted as one person.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LA MIRADA; HOUSING PROJECT WINS TENTATIVE CITY APPROVAL

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has tentatively approved plans for a housing development that 
will accommodate 2,000 residents on a 90-acre site that once was part of an oil 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevron Land and Development Co., which owns the vacant parcel between Beach 
Boulevard and Hillsborough Drive, plans to build 214 detached single-family 
homes, 102 townhouses and 450 condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Means, a Chevron project manager, estimated the development's cost at $90 
million to $100 million. About $1 million will go toward the removal of oil 
contamination in the property's soil. 
</P>
<P>
 If the cleanup goes as planned and the council grants final approval, Chevron 
expects to break ground in mid-1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will hold a public hearing on the project's tract map Tuesday and 
decide whether to grant final approval, Sloan said. JOHN CANALIS

 An 88-year-old carousel will keep on spinning at Shoreline Village for at 
least another year before it is dismantled and shipped to its new home in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The carousel's owner, the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency, approved a 
one-year reprieve in the move from Long Beach for the hand-carved attraction, 
which was built in 1906 by renowned craftsman Charles Looff.In return, the Long 
Beach City Council agreed this week not to block the merry-go-round's future 
move.  
</P>
<P>
 Shoreline Village leased the carousel from previous owner Marianne Stevens of 
Roswell, N.M., under a 10-year agreement that expired in the summer. The 
shopping center will now lease the carousel from the San Francisco 
Redevelopment Agency, which recently bought the attraction from Stevens for $1 
million. STEVE EAMES

CITY HALL JOURNAL: HAWAIIAN GARDENS; VOTERS WILL DECIDE HOW CITY CLERK IS 
SELECTED

<TEXT>
<P>
 Voters will be asked to decide next March whether the city clerk should be 
elected or continue to be appointed by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4-1 last week to place the question on the March 7 municipal 
election ballot.Voters will also be asked whether the city clerk, if elected, 
should serve two- or four-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the outcome, the city clerk will have a reduced role in the city 
government. The council has decided to make the city clerk a part-time adviser 
with a nominal salary instead of a full-time management employee who earns 
$75,000 a year. 
</P>

OUTCRY FORCES SECOND VOTE ON FILLING OF VACANT SCHOOL BOARD POSITION; 
EDUCATION: TRUSTEES BYPASSED TOP-RATED CANDIDATE, A LATINO, IN FAVOR OF FORMER 
MEMBER CONVICTED OF A FELONY.

 The Compton school board, under fire for appointing a new board member in a 
secret ballot and for bypassing a Latino applicant who was rated as the top 
candidate, is scheduled to vote again Friday on the appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members voted 4 to 2 last week to appoint Saul E. Lankster, 49, the 
owner of a Compton flower business, to fill a vacant seat. In selecting 
Lankster, an African American, the board bypassed Martin Chavez, a Port of Los 
Angeles human resources officer, who received the top rating from a screening 
committee that evaluated 13 applicants for the position. 
</P>
<P>
 Lankster, who served on the board from 1977 to 1981, was convicted in 1985 of 
felony charges for selling false traffic school diplomas to undercover state 
investigators. He was sentenced to 120 days in jail and three years probation. 
</P>
<P>
 The board scheduled another vote, however, after Jerome Harris, the 
administrator appointed by the state to run the beleaguered school district, 
said the board's decision to vote by secret ballot had violated public meeting 
laws. Lankster attended the meeting Tuesday night but did not take his seat 
with the board. 
</P>
<P>
 The board is scheduled to meet at 5:30 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Several speakers also sharply criticized the board for selecting Lankster 
despite Chavez's top rating. If Lankster is seated, the board will have six 
African-American members and one Latino. More than half of the district's 
students are Latino.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's time the board stop playing these racist games and hire the 
best-qualified candidate," businessman Pedro Pallan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Activist Melissa Paredes voiced similar feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been trampled on," she said. "We want this school board balanced. We 
want another Latino on the board." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Willard H. Murray Jr. (D-Paramount) attended the meeting and 
released a letter to the board that criticized the decision.  
</P>
<P>
 "Shame on you for not having the courage and the sense of fairness to do for 
Latinos what you want white America to do for you," he said in the letter. 
Murray did not speak at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Amen Rahh acknowledged at the meeting that he had voted for 
Lankster, but denied that the board decision was racist. 
</P>
<P>
 President Michael Hopwood said in an earlier interview that he had voted for 
Lankster. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has community support, he was the only candidate who had previous 
experience and he spoke eloquently on the issues," Hopwood said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Lankster's application material made no reference to his criminal 
record.  
</P>
<P>
 Board member Sam Littleton challenged charges of racism. "It's never been like 
that," he said in an interview. "I want the best person to win, and I feel the 
best person did win." 
</P>
<P>
 Toi Jackson, another board member, said the board "chose the best candidate" 
and insisted she would not change her vote Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lankster refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Lankster and Chavez were among four finalists selected by a community 
committee that screened the applicants. The others were Otha Ray Scott, a 
retired high school teacher, and Mae Thomas, a patient resources worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee member Jean Sanders condemned the board for choosing Lankster over 
Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
 They "have no concept of human rights and dignity," she said. "If a person was 
chosen as No. 1 by a lot of people, why would (the board) reverse it?" 
</P>
<P>
 The new board member will replace Lynn Dymally, who was ousted after not 
attending a meeting in a year. The new member will serve the remainder of 
Dymally's term, which expires in November, 1995.

A DEEP DISAGREEMENT; COUNCIL'S REJECTION OF PLANS TO EXPAND UNITED ROCK QUARRY 
TOUCHES OFF DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SULLIVAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Half a century after gravel mining formed the foundation for the city of 
Irwindale, disputes over one quarry are pitting neighbor against neighbor and 
calling into question the identity of this close-knit industry town. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 27, the City Council denied United Rock Products' request to deepen 
two of its quarry pits from 150 to 275 feet, which would have allowed the 
company to continue mining for an additional 10 to 12 years. The company says 
it will be forced to close within a few years if its request isn't granted, and 
it has challenged the decision in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Although details of the dispute are highly technical, the controversy 
surrounding it has touched off debate about the city's future. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal's opponents, many of whom live on the edge of the quarry, say 
they fear that further excavation could contaminate ground water, disturb the 
seismic stability of their properties and raise dust particles that may 
threaten their health -- even their lives.  
</P>
<P>
 The company and its supporters argue that the health hazards are minimal, and 
that other risks can be controlled through proper management. They say United 
Rock is one of the few secure sources of jobs and income in Irwindale, a 
good-neighbor business that takes care of its employees and contributes 
generously to city-sponsored philanthropies. They say that if the excavation 
proposal isn't approved, the city's bedrock industry could go the way of the 
dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
 United Rock operates three quarry pits in Irwindale -- half of the active pits 
in the city. Cal Mat and Livingston Graham operate the others. That's less than 
a third the number of pits than there were in the 1940s and '50s, during 
Irwindale's rock and gravel boom. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue from the mining industry bought Irwindale residents a unique level of 
city services. Now United Rock and its supporters warn that by forcing the 
company to close, the city will damage itself financially. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (turning down the quarry's proposal) changes the makeup of the city 
quite a lot," said United Rock's operations manager Arnold Brink. "It 
practically disintegrates their tax base. A lot of the perks that the residents 
of the city get are a result of the sand and gravel industry. If they kick the 
sand and gravel industry in the heels, why, it's going to come back to haunt 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 But others say it's about time the city sought new sources of income. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the opposition to the continuing deepening of the pits was that the 
community has had enough of gravel quarrying, and that it's time to move on and 
use those sites from other purposes, and to move away from a continuing 
identity as a location of rock quarries." 
</P>
<P>
 Those rock quarries, however, help pay for city perks ranging from free 
haircuts for senior citizens, to home improvement grants, prescription drug 
coverage and a municipal scholarship fund. Part of the money for these services 
comes from United Rock's business license fees, along with sales, property and 
mining taxes, which amount to almost $1 million a year, Brink said. And in 
exchange for permission to deepen the pits, the company offered Irwindale a 
lump sum of $3.5 million and a contribution of at least $20,000 a year to the 
city's scholarship fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's reserves, up to a high of $35 million in 1987, are projected to be 
only about $4.6 million by the end of the fiscal year in June, City Manager 
David Caretto said. 
</P>
<P>
 United Rock and related businesses on its site employ about 300 people, at 
least 10% of whom are Irwindale residents, Brink said. And the company buys 
about 20% of its supplies from within the city, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Although reclamation of the pits could yield new revenues from the industries 
that would take their place, a financial analysis commissioned by the city 
suggests that usage wouldn't replace the money from the quarries.  
</P>
<P>
 But opponents of the proposal call United Rock's offer a kind of bribe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We resent the obvious attempt by United Rock to 'buy' additional depth by 
offering the city, and scholarship fund, money in one form or another," the 
petition against the proposal states. "Such 'payoff' is too little and too 
late; money can never cover the costs and suffering of the residents." 
</P>
<P>
 Jose J. Vargas, who has lived next to the quarry for eight years, says dust 
from the quarry exacerbated his son's asthma; the son died of asthma last year 
at the age of 33. No amount of financial compensation can replace that, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company denies that the death is related to dust from its operations. In 
fact, Brink said, a sprinkler system installed around the edge of the quarry 
prevents most dust from even reaching the homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmental impact report on the project gives credence to the 
neighbors' complaints and the company's contention that it can resolve them. 
However, the report also recommends measures to reduce these problems, and 
Brink said United Rock is willing to do more than required. The company already 
voluntarily monitors water quality in its pits four times a year, he said. And 
they are willing to go above and beyond other health and safety measures 
detailed in the report. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, United Rock filed a lawsuit against the city in Los Angeles 
Superior Court, charging that the city violated its own rules by refusing the 
proposal, which the Planning Commission had previously approved. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members did not return phone calls from The Times.

GOVERNMENT'S 4-YEAR BIAS LAWSUIT AGAINST EL MONTE ENDS; JOBS: U.S. HAD 
ORIGINALLY ALLEGED 64 VICTIMS. JUDGE RULES THAT TWO INDIVIDUALS WERE VICTIMS OF 
DISCRIMINATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The federal government's four-year discrimination lawsuit against El Monte 
ended last week after a federal court judge ruled that two individuals had been 
discriminated against. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Department of Justice had alleged that the city denied blacks and 
Asian Americans entry-level jobs as police officers and firefighters. The two 
individuals, who were the only ones left in the suit after a long wrangle 
between the city and Justice Department, will receive $20,000 in compensation 
each, for a total city payout of $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 That reduced number contrasts dramatically with the 64 possible victims 
originally brought forward by the federal Department of Justice, the $330,000 
the city was required to set aside for all those victims and the $550,000 the 
city ultimately spent on legal fees fighting the federal case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel like it was kind of a witch hunt," said El Monte Mayor Patricia 
Wallach. "It's just ludicrous that the Department of Justice came in with a 
case this thin." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallach's complaints were echoed by lawyers representing three other cities, 
Alhambra and Pomona in the San Gabriel Valley and Torrance in the South Bay. 
All three cities have been accused of discrimination in hiring police officer 
and firefighters and were likewise sued by the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department officials say they prosecuted the cities only after 
receiving discrimination complaints against them and after investigating to 
find sufficient legal grounds to file the lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 The department began legal action against El Monte in 1990. According to 
federal officials, the city's 107-member police force had only one black member 
and its 66-member fire department only one Asian American firefighter. Federal 
officials argued that the low numbers were the result of discriminatory hiring 
policies from 1985 to 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the city agreed to set aside $330,000 in compensation for alleged 
victims. The Justice Department put ads in local newspapers asking people who 
thought they were victims of discrimination to come forward. 
</P>
<P>
 After sifting through 64 claims, the city agreed to pay 14 individuals, said 
Mary Dollarhide, the attorney who represented El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the city discovered that the first person on the list was a white 
male and the second person had a criminal record that would have disqualified 
him for a job as a police officer, El Monte officials decided to contest the 
payment, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Six other alleged victims were disqualified for compensation be cause they 
would have been too old at the time of application to have been hired as police 
or fire cadets, Dollarhide said. Others were eliminated for other, similar 
kinds of reasons that the Department of Justice could have easily checked, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were coming out and doing what I perceive to be sloppy work," Dollarhide 
said. "If we hadn't challenged them, we would have forked out money to Mr. 
White Guy." 
</P>
<P>
 The city believes that the final two candidates also do not qualify. One lacks 
the educational background claimed on her application and another failed a 
number of qualifying tests for other police departments, Dollarhide said. But 
after Los Angeles U.S. District Court Judge Manuel Real ruled against the city 
on Nov. 7, the City Council decided to end the costly legal battle and pay the 
remaining two, Dollarhide said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very frustrating from the city's point of view," Wallach said. She added 
that city officials kept battling the federal government instead of simply 
paying the money because city officials did not believe the city was guilty of 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials still deny that they discriminated against anyone. According to 
statistics in a recent ACLU study of police and fire departments, El Monte now 
has three blacks and four Asian Americans on its 126-member police force. Among 
the city's 57 firefighters, one is black and one is Asian American. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials say the low numbers do not reflect patterns of 
discrimination, but simply the difficulty of attracting minority candidates to 
work in small cities where pay is usually lower than in larger urban agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the three other cities sued by the Justice Department are also 
crying foul. The number of victims will ultimately amount to a few handfuls and 
not the scores initially claimed by the government, the attorneys contend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sellers' market for minority public safety workers," said Drew 
Bridges, Alhambra's attorney. Alhambra recently lost to the city of San Jose 
its black police chief, Raymond Brooks, who was hired by Alhambra after a 
nationwide recruitment, Bridges said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government claimed that nearly 100 individuals were discriminated 
against in Alhambra. But by checking each claim, many applicants were 
eliminated and the final number might actually be closer to 10, Bridges said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The numbers are ludicrous," agreed Torrance City Atty. John Fellows, whose 
city is sifting through 76 claims. "It's the closest thing to extortion that 
you can imagine." 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Pomona, which was accused of discriminating against black police 
officers, may reach a resolution with the federal government by the end of the 
year, said Pomona City Atty. Arnold Alvarez-Glasman. The city, which set aside 
$160,000 for compensation and $40,000 for a recruitment program, has nearly 
finished sifting through the claims of 44 people, Alvarez-Glasman said.

SELLING THE STREETS OF LONG BEACH; ROADSIDE SIGNS AND OTHER CITY CASTOFFS TO BE 
SOLD AT NEW BOUTIQUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Sandblasted fire hydrants, old street signs, used desks and stoplights. These 
are some of the city castoffs that Long Beach officials plan to offer for sale 
when they open their own city boutique next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The premise behind City Goods, scheduled to open Nov. 25 on Pine Avenue 
downtown, is that residents and visitors are eager for Long Beach souvenirs. 
People regularly steal street signs, officials point out. Why not give them a 
chance to buy the real thing? 
</P>
<P>
 Some pessimists find it hard to believe that shoppers will actually buy a 
refurbished fireplug for $170, but Sharon Daniels, a city projects officer who 
is heading the boutique project, said other cities have had success with 
similar ventures.  
</P>
<P>
 "West Covina and San Diego are already selling an entire line of items that 
you wouldn't think would sell," Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
 West Covina opened a city store in a new shopping mall about a year ago. The 
merchandise has became so popular that the city now produces a gift catalogue 
that is mailed to a growing list of out-of-state customers, said the city's 
finance director, Abraham Koniarsky. 
</P>
<P>
 The West Covina store is breaking even financially, Koniarsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego has stores in City Hall, a major shopping mall and a tourist 
village. A fourth store was closed in the past year, Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakewood opened a store Monday in City Hall. The shop features a signature 
line of clothing labeled Club Lakewood, said Donald Waldie, a city spokesman. 
Glendale opened a city store earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody expects these outlets to balance their city budgets, officials say, but 
they believe marketing their city will promote civic pride. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels says she looks forward to donning a T-shirt with the official Long 
Beach logo when she travels, and she believes that others will want to do the 
same. The shirts and hats will help promote the city's image as a tourist 
destination, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, it's cost-effective to sell old street signs, parking meters and 
water meter dials rather than offering them for scrap metal, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were selling old street signs for scrap at 30 cents a pound," Koniarsky 
said. "Now they're going for $15 a sign." 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach has no plans as yet for a gift catalogue or additional stores. At 
this point, city staff is waiting to see how the idea takes hold. So far, the 
city has agreed to spend $205,000 to lease the store, to pay retail consultants 
to establish and manage the shop, and to cover other operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels said she hopes the boutique will make enough money -- especially 
during the lucrative holiday season -- to cover expenses and turn a modest 
profit within a year. 
</P>
<P>
 City Goods, 309 Pine Ave., will be open from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Mondays through 
Wednesdays, 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Thursdays and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
Saturdays, and 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sundays.

<P>
 Petroleum Recycling Corp. of Signal Hill and three of its executives have been 
cleared of charges that they let toxic rainwater run off their parking lot and 
into city streets in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The 38-count criminal complaint was dismissed for lack of evidence last week 
by Long Beach Superior Court Judge Richard R. Romero. 
</P>
<P>
 Petroleum Recycling and its officials -- President Richard Davis McAuley, 
compliance officer Ronald R. Daerr and former plant manager Mark James Vigeant 
-- were accused of dumping 200,000 gallons of tainted rainwater into a storm 
drain near the company's East 29th Street facility in January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials said they have the necessary storm-water discharge permit, 
tested the water and found it to be clean before letting it flow into the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Petroleum Recycling was purchased by Enviropur Waste Refining and 
Technology Inc. of Chicago and renamed Enviropur West Corp. STEVE EAMES

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; 7TH STREET CLEANUP TO UNITE CITY GROUPS

<TEXT>
<P>
 A coalition of community groups from throughout the city will join together 
Saturday to spruce up 7th Street from the Long Beach Freeway to the city's 
eastern border. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of neighborhood associations and business organizations have pledged 
tools and time to pick up trash, manicure greenery and sweep along the six-mile 
thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the work will be done on the street's west end, which is inundated 
with litter, said project organizer Michele Harris, president of the United 
South of Seventh Neighborhood Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Since August, the idea for the cleanup project has spread across the city, 
Harris said, stirring pride usually reserved for nearby Ocean Boulevard, which 
she called the city's front door. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just don't want 7th Street to be considered the back door. There are a lot 
of active neighborhoods along 7th Street," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Work stations will open at 8:30 a.m. and will be set up where 7th intersects 
Locust, Orange and Park avenues. Coffee and pastries will be available. JOHN

<P>
 ABC Unified District school board members have reversed their decision to 
fight a Costa Mesa developer's proposed housing project on 13 acres the 
district owns near Whitney High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The $18-million project had stalled last month when the board deadlocked 3 to 
3 on the developer's proposed financial plan, which spelled out the district's 
share of the profits.The developer, Warmington Homes, then filed a $2.5-million 
claim, accusing the district of reneging on the deal, which had been approved 
previously by the board and by the Cerritos City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The board decided to consider the issue again Tuesday, and voted 6 to 1 to 
move forward with the project and to transfer ownership of the land to 
Warmington. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Howard Kwon, who had originally opposed the deal, urged the board 
to reconsider the plan to avert a costly lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>

COMMUNITY NEWS: LA MIRADA; REPAIRS UNDER WAY ON TWO CREEK PARK DAMS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City crews have begun repairing two weather-beaten dams in Creek Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Water runoff generated by winter storms over the past several years had eroded 
land that had kept the cement barriers in place.Without repair, the dams, which 
help irrigate the park, would have shifted out of position or collapsed, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews started the $80,000 project last week by adding soil and large boulders 
to the edge of the man-made creek running through the middle of the park.  
</P>
<P>
 The park's five dams were installed in the 1960s and '70s to ease the flow of 
water running through the stream, which is fed by a county flood control 
channel that collects rainwater from the hills of Whittier and La Habra 
Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Otherwise, the water would come through that flood control channel and tear 
that park right up," said Perry Turigliatto, the city's environmental director. 
</P>
<P>
 The repairs should be completed in mid-December. JOHN CANALIS

<P>
 A man who confessed that he helped beat an elderly woman to death 17 years ago 
is scheduled to stand trial Wednesday in Norwalk Superior Court.  
</P>
<P>
 Julian A. Imperial, 38, is accused of killing Mary R. Stein, 73, during a 
burglary of her apartment on Pickering Avenue.He is charged with first-degree 
murder while committing a burglary and could face the death penalty if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Alfonso D. Hermo of Whittier Municipal Court set the trial date during a 
recent preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Imperial told Whittier police in August that he and another man broke into 
Stein's apartment the evening of Oct. 4, 1977, and fatally beat her while she 
was in her bed. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his religious beliefs finally compelled him to turn himself in. "I'm 
tired of running from the Lord," he said in an interview.

COMMUNITY NEWS: PARAMOUNT; SCHOOL BOND ISSUE WILL GO ON MARCH 7 BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 School district officials have decided to ask voters whether to raise taxes to 
build new schools and refurbish existing buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board voted 4-1 to place a $15-million bond issue on the March 7 
ballot.Trustee Richard Caldwell, a former superintendent of Paramount Unified, 
said he opposed the measure because of complaints he received from tax-weary 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm supposed to represent the feelings of the electorate," Caldwell said. 
"The people I talked to are anti-bonds." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are scrambling to provide more classrooms in response to a surge in 
enrollment in recent years. This year's enrollment is estimated at more than 
14,300, about 700 students above last year's enrollment. Enrollment is expected 
to grow by an additional 2,000 students during the next six years, said Gene 
Hartline, the district's business manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Overcrowding contributed to a melee at Paramount High School last year, school 
officials said. The high school, originally built for 1,800 students, now 
houses about 3,100. Some elementary schools now have more portable classrooms 
than permanent rooms, Hartline said.  
</P>
<P>
 The proposed bond must be approved by two-thirds of the voters. Some of the 
money would be earmarked for two new elementary schools in the southern part of 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the bonds would add about $22 every year to homeowners' property 
taxes for the next 25 years. Hartline said a recent study indicated substantial 
support among the district's residents for new taxes, but some voters remain 
skeptical that new schools are needed. PSYCHE PASCUAL

<TEXT>
<P>
 The county has tentatively agreed to donate one acre of La Mirada Regional 
Park to the city to build a $2-million gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
 County parks and recreation officials have issued a letter saying they will 
deed the land to La Mirada if the city provides office space in the gym for a 
county recreation staff member and agrees to care for landscaping near the 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The provisions also require the city to maintain a parking lot next to the gym 
site off Alicante Road and to expand it if the gym creates a parking shortage. 
Los Angeles County supervisors could approve the land transfer within a few 
weeks, said Henry Roman, the county's assistant parks and recreation director. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has given away about 11 parkland sites to cities in the last two 
years. JOHN CANALIS

CLAREMONT AUTO CENTER CLOSES, IDLING 200 WORKERS; REVENUE: CITY HAS RECEIVED 
$600,000 A YEAR IN SALES TAX. OFFICIALS EXPECT TO FIND A NEW BUYER IN A MONTH 
OR TWO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Claremont Auto Center shut down suddenly on Monday, putting more than 200 
employees out of work and dealing a severe blow to Claremont city coffers, 
which received about $600,000 each year in sales tax from the center. 
</P>
<P>
 That is equal to one-quarter of Claremont's total sales-tax revenues, 
according to City Manager Glenn Southard. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's large; it would have a noticeable impact on our budget," Southard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they are already negotiating with several potential buyers 
to reopen the center, which is home to franchises carrying Acura, Cadillac, GMC 
Truck, Hyundai, Isuzu, Pontiac and Ford cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing wrong with the auto center; it's selling cars and for a long 
time it was an extremely successful enterprise," Southard said. "It is carrying 
past debt, and it needs a more aggressive approach to management." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the center was forced to shut down when its chief 
financier, General Electric Capital Corp., withdrew its credit line after weeks 
of negotiations. The move caught everyone by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew there were renegotiations going on, but we had no idea it was going 
to close," Southard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Bell, the center's owner, was unavailable for comment. Bell owns several 
car dealerships in the Inland Empire, including Tom Bell Toyota of Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Claremont city officials said Bell, who has a history of operating successful 
dealerships, bought the seven franchises of the Claremont Auto Center last year 
with financing from GE Capital after the previous operator, Tak Sugimura, could 
not make it profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 The Claremont Auto Center, whose huge signs are visible from the San 
Bernardino (10) Freeway, has long battled financial troubles. Since 1991, 
Claremont's Redevelopment Agency has loaned $1.1 million to two successive 
operators of the center to keep it afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they have recouped their loans by more than double with 
sales-tax revenues, and they were optimistic that the center will only be 
closed this time for a month or two until a new buyer is found. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hopeful things will work out," said City Councilwoman Diane Ring. "It's 
too good a marketplace for it not to work out." 
</P>
<P>
 Ring then referred all questions to Southard, who declined to speculate on 
what specific cuts the city might consider in its budget if the auto center 
does not reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 He warned that the closure could have a ripple effect on other businesses in 
the area, especially those in related fields such as carwashes and auto parts 
stores.

COVER STORY; JOAN AND JERRY MCMILLIN THOUGHT THEIR CHILD-RAISING DAYS WERE 
DONE. BUT WHEN THEIR DAUGHTER WAS SLAIN, LEAVING TWO GRANDCHILDREN, THE 
MCMILLINS HAD TO BECOME. . .; TWICE THE PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like a lot of people in their late 50s and early 60s, Joan and Jerry McMillin 
had a retirement plan: Travel the country in a camper, grow old with friends, 
put some money aside for their grandchildren's education. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years ago, those plans evaporated when their daughter was stabbed to death 
by her husband in front of their two children in an Orange County motel room. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the McMillins are parents again, raising grandchildren George, 11 and 
Audrey, 10, in a white bungalow in Bellflower after a five-year custody battle 
that exhausted their life savings and left them in debt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neither of us wanted to do this," Joan McMillin said. "We had a beautiful 
picture in front of us that we were moving toward. But the glass broke and the 
picture was destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
 The McMillins are among a growing number of grandparents thrust into the job 
of raising children for a second time, missing out on long-awaited retirements. 
According to census data, in 1990 three times as many grandparents were raising 
their grandchildren as in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened to the McMillins was an extreme case; more often, grandparents 
assume child-rearing roles while their own children deal with drug addictions, 
spousal abuse, divorce or financial pressures that limit the time they can 
devote to parenting. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of support groups have formed throughout the United States to help 
grandparents such as the McMillins cope with the financial, physical and 
emotional demands of raising children. One of the country's first groups -- 
Grandparents as Parents -- started in Long Beach eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The McMillins say they found kinship and solace at the weekly meetings. The 
organization brought in experts in family law, the social welfare bureaucracy 
and financial matters to give grandparents advice. At picnics, holiday parties 
and counseling sessions, grandparent members shared information -- from cooking 
tips and child-rearing strategies to horror stories about battling their own 
children for custody of the grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 The McMillins met a retired Los Angeles nurse with colon cancer who is raising 
five grandchildren, all born addicted to drugs. They met a couple from Lakewood 
who have been battling for custody of an 8-year-old grandson abandoned at birth 
by his drug-addicted mother. Another member of the group, a single grandmother, 
had won custody of her grandson from his drug-addicted, abusive mother, only to 
learn that the boy's father, who is in prison for attempted murder, might gain 
custody when he is released in a couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Grandparents also learn to cope with guilt stemming from their own children's 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We learned we weren't bad parents, and we're not failures," McMillin said. 
"Some of the guilt was lifted and we could go on." 
</P>
<P>
 Joan McMillin, 58, a beautician, appears to be flourishing in her role as mom. 
On a recent afternoon, the aroma of chicken soup wafts from the kitchen where 
she is standing in front of a pot, stirring. Jerry McMillin, 60, a former 
refrigerator repairman, sits in an armchair in the living room, overseeing 
George Gallagher Jr. and Audrey Gallagher as they do math homework.  
</P>
<P>
 On the living room wall is a portrait of their mother, Barbara. She looks 
radiant, youthful, her head cocked, her smile self-assured. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture is deceiving, though. Barbara's life was never as easy as the 
photograph suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara was the youngest of Joan McMillin's seven children. When Barbara was 
still a baby, McMillin left her abusive first husband in Massachusetts, packed 
the kids in the car and drove to California. She moved to Bellflower in 1970, 
working at odd jobs to keep food on the table. She went back to school but 
continued to work nights and weekends. She often had to leave Barbara in the 
care of the older children. Joan met Jerry, a divorced father of three grown 
children, in the late 1970s. They married a few years later. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara met George Gallagher when she was 14. He was 20, with the looks of a 
TV anchor, and had a well-paying aerospace factory job. Almost immediately, 
Barbara became pregnant. In 1983, at age 17, she was married and the mother of 
two children. 
</P>
<P>
 During the marriage, George Gallagher drank, smoked marijuana and beat 
Barbara, according to Joan and Jerry McMillin. The two children lived on and 
off with their grandparents.  
</P>
<P>
 In February, 1986, Barbara and George divorced and the court gave custody of 
the children to Barbara. But Barbara kept returning to George, despite the 
pleas of Joan and Jerry McMillin to leave him for good.  
</P>
<P>
 Barbara exhibited the classic symptoms of a battered woman, said Sylvie de 
Toledo, a licensed clinical social worker who founded Grandparents as Parents 
in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somehow the man still has a lot of power and control," de Toledo said. "When 
there are children involved, and you're dependent on an abusive man emotionally 
and financially, it's very hard to break away because you're wondering how 
you're going to survive."  
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1988, Barbara, George and the children moved into the Twin Cypress 
Motel in Orange. One day six months later, Audrey and George Jr. were helping 
pack the car for a trip to the beach. Their parents started arguing about 
money. George Gallagher pulled out a knife and stabbed his wife repeatedly in 
the head. Audrey was 4 at the time. George Jr. was 5. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 George put the children in the car and went to his mother's house in Yorba 
Linda. In front of Audrey, he stabbed his sister Mary in the chest, killing 
her. He put the kids in the car again, drove onto the Costa Mesa Freeway and 
crashed into the center divider. He left the kids, who were uninjured, took off 
his clothes and ran naked through a nearby neighborhood, where he was arrested 
without a struggle.  
</P>
<P>
 After a two-day trial, a Superior Court judge ruled that Gallagher was insane 
when he stabbed his wife but was sane when he stabbed his sister. Gallagher was 
ordered confined to a state mental hospital, where he remains. Even if he is 
declared sane in the future, however, Gallagher will face a prison sentence of 
26 years to life in the death of his sister. After Gallagher's trial, Joan 
McMillin told a reporter: "Now I know there's a safe future for our family and 
my grandchildren." 
</P>
<P>
 But their problems were far from over. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the McMillins' objections, Orange County social workers placed the 
children with Gallagher's teen-age sister. A few months later, the McMillins 
won temporary custody of George Jr. and Audrey, but George Gallagher's mother 
and brother sued for permanent custody. 
</P>
<P>
 There followed a five-year battle in Orange County Juvenile Court involving 
the McMillins, George Gallagher's family and social workers. Although the 
children remained with the McMillins, a series of hearings were held to 
determine whether they would be suitable parents, and to determine how the 
children were adjusting. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At various times, Joan McMillin says, she was blamed by some social workers 
and the Gallagher family for her daughter's death and denounced as a bad mother 
and grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stress was horrible," McMillin said. "I couldn't eat or sleep. You start 
even wondering about yourself. Maybe they're right, maybe you're wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids are not a problem," she said. "I can do 10 kids. I roller-skate, I 
ride bikes, I do all that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the custody battle that took its toll. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Jerry McMillin suffered three strokes, causing mild brain damage that 
forced him to give up his successful refrigerator-repair business.  
</P>
<P>
 The McMillins now live on Social Security and what Joan McMillin earns from 
three part-time jobs: cosmetologist, demonstrator of grocery store products on 
weekends, seasonal worker in a marmalade factory. 
</P>
<P>
 The children, who were aware that a court might force them to leave the 
McMillins, also were having problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Audrey talked like a baby. She lay on the sofa in the fetal position. She wet 
the bed every night. She forgot how to read and write and had to repeat 
kindergarten. For a time, she refused to go to bed unless the windows and doors 
were covered with blankets. She kept saying she was afraid that "daddy would 
come get me," according to Joan McMillin. 
</P>
<P>
 She said George Jr. "would get angry and throw and break things. He would hit 
Audrey and she would hit him. When I tried to get him to talk to me, he would 
say, 'Why can't we just live with you? Why do we have to go to court? Maybe 
they're going to send us away.' "It was very hard to convince this little boy 
that he was going to stay with us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, neither Joan nor Jerry ever considered giving up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to do what I thought was right, to stand by my wife and take care of 
the kids," Jerry said. "I promised the kids I'd be as good a father as I could. 
When I make a commitment, I do my best to keep it." 
</P>
<P>
 Court Commissioner Gale Hickman said the case dragged on partly because he was 
concerned whether the McMillins were up to the task of raising children who had 
experienced such trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who had the kids, including the McMillins, would have a difficult task 
raising them," Hickman said. "I never had any doubt about the McMillins' energy 
and willpower but (doubted) whether they had whatever it might take to cope 
with these kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd have thought that about anybody," Hickman said. "These kids were very 
disrupted." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Hickman ruled that the McMillins should have permanent custody of 
George and Audrey. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaking the bond between the McMillins and their grandchildren might cause 
George and Audrey irreparable damage, the commissioner decided. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens to kids who . . . have bonded only to have the bond destroyed? 
They stop trusting," he said. "And when they stop trusting, they get angry and 
they carry their anger around. It disrupts them forever and ever." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the year since the McMillins were awarded permanent custody and the court 
terminated its monitoring, George and Audrey "have done 10 times better in 
attitude, in feeling secure, in school, than they had in the previous six 
years," Joan McMillin said. "They're calm, they're happy, their lives turned 
right around."  
</P>
<P>
 George, a sixth-grader, does well in school, plays the saxophone and complains 
about not being allowed to go to the mall unattended or stay out after dark or 
see R-rated movies. Audrey loves math, reading and talking to her grandmother 
about clothes, boys and the latest hairstyles.  
</P>
<P>
 McMillin sews Halloween costumes for herself and the kids, and bakes cookies 
with them at Christmas for teachers and neighbors. She takes them to school the 
first day, monitors their studies closely and encourages them to do their best. 
</P>
<P>
 She worries, though, about allowing George and Audrey outside after dinner, 
about letting them ride bikes alone, about whether their clothes will 
inadvertently offend gang members, about what might happen if they walk through 
the wrong neighborhoods. She acknowledges that she didn't have to worry about 
most of these things with her own children. 
</P>
<P>
 Audrey and George rarely see their paternal grandmother, Janine Phillips, 61, 
one of the Gallagher family members who sued for custody. Like Joan McMillin, 
Phillips was a single mother who raised seven children alone after her first 
husband left her. Now, she is helping raise three other grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips said the custody dispute also left her in debt, forcing her to 
declare bankruptcy. Though she is unhappy with the custody ruling, she is 
resigned to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thing is that the children are doing well," she said. "I hope and 
pray the kids are all right." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Audrey still thinks about her mother at times. "Sometimes I wish I had a mom," 
Audrey says. "Kids at school ask me, 'Where's your mom?' So I brought in a 
picture of her grave. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people ask me what happened, it brings back bad memories. I just say, 
'My mom's dead. My dad killed her.' And I leave it at that." 
</P>
<P>
 George Jr. says, "I just don't talk about it."

 Although the children are adjusting, Joan McMillin says, "I see heartache when 
they reach puberty and the parents of a girlfriend or boyfriend want to know 
about their parents. What happens when (someone) finds out their dad's in 
prison? What if (the parents) say, 'You're not going out with my son or 
daughter?' 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why we talk about it. So they aren't devastated by it." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Joan McMillin says she has few regrets about forgoing her retirement dreams 
and becoming a parent again. She feels best when friends compliment her about 
the job she and Jerry are doing with the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them are envious, the women especially, because their kids are 
married and gone and they're left with the old man. 
</P>
<P>
 "We listen to our friends and, since they've retired, they don't do anything. 
Some are sick; some have died; some, their backs went out, some have bad feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're as crazy as we were. It's just that we don't have money, so we 
can't go too far," she joked. "And now we need a baby-sitter."

PROP. 187 'DISCUSSION' LEADS TO ARREST OF ALHAMBRA TEACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN UHRICH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a heated classroom debate on Proposition 187, the only thing everyone 
seems to agree on is that an Alhambra teacher with 28 untroubled years of 
experience at the same school put his foot on a student's shoulder and was 
arrested on suspicion of battery. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eyes of the accusing student and some of his friends, all of them of 
Mexican descent, the teacher was espousing racist remarks such as "Your people 
bring disease" and then kicked the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eyes of Mark Keppel High School teacher Donald Monson, 58, and at least 
one of the student's friends, the teacher was talking about other people's 
attitudes, not his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it was racist. I thought it was just part of the debate," the 
friend, who is also Latino, said of the classroom discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Monson said the student who later accused him was misbehaving in class, 
continually standing up to shout out his views despite repeated warnings. He 
said he never intended to harm the boy, but admitted making a mistake by using 
his foot to push the youngster back into his seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been teaching for 29 years and no one has ever called me a racist 
before," Monson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident at the school offers a glimpse of the high emotions surrounding 
Proposition 187 and how those emotions color perceptions of events. 
</P>
<P>
 The students said the discussion about Proposition 187, which voters 
overwhelmingly passed Nov. 8, started Oct. 11. Although the third period 
advisory, or homeroom class, is designed to allow students time to speak with 
one another and do homework, the discussion focused on Proposition 187 and 
captured the attention of nearly all of the students. 
</P>
<P>
 Monson said he initiated the class discussion about Proposition 187 and used a 
voter pamphlet to speak about the proposition, which calls for denying health 
and education benefits to illegal immigrants. Monson, who works with the 
school's student exchange program, said he used an example of a former 
student's entry into the United States to illustrate some of the racist 
attitudes that Mexican immigrants face. 
</P>
<P>
 The accusing student's friends, who asked that their names not be published, 
said Monson had made what they considered racist remarks during a discussion 
about the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the police report, Monson had told a group of students to be 
quiet and had told one student to move away. The student moved but continued 
talking. The police report said Monson then allegedly kicked the talking 
student in the shoulder, walked away, then came back and kicked him again and 
told him to leave the classroom, using profanity. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, the student left the classroom and went to the dean's 
office. Police were called and the student decided to make a citizen's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Monson was released later that day on his own recognizance. He returned to 
work later that week.  
</P>
<P>
 In his recollection of the incident, Monson said the one student had became 
"excited" during the Proposition 187 discussion, spoke loudly to the class and 
repeatedly stood up. Monson said he used his foot to force the student to 
remain in his seat. Monson maintains he raised his foot once.  
</P>
<P>
 "I made a mistake," the soft-spoken teacher said.  
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office is expected to decide next week whether to file 
charges of misdemeanor battery.

ALTADENA MAN GETS $118,000 AWARD IN SUIT AGAINST POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICKI TORRES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Pasadena Superior Court jury has awarded $118,000 in damages to an Altadena 
man who was injured in a 1991 fracas involving nine family members and Pasadena 
police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the civil trial lasted only about three days, the jury deliberated 
for six days before reaching a decision Nov. 4 in favor of Gordon McCullough, 
40. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the Pasadena Police Department is an unusually violent group, 
but there are cases where officers get out of hand, and it's up to jurors to 
compensate citizens when people's rights are violated," said McCullough's 
attorney, Joe Hopkins, after the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 But Assistant City Atty. Larry Newberry said the city expects to legally 
contest the jury's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 McCullough, a schizophrenic, had been attending a family reunion Aug. 17, 
1991, at Brookside Park when he caught the attention of social workers at a 
nearby county-sponsored picnic. They said they saw a man wearing a woman's robe 
and a backpack-type baby carrier with a doll inside, and he was leading two 
small children by the hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The children eventually proved to be McCullough's. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrived, and a confrontation ensued. The melee drew in McCullough's 
family members and a bystander, all of whom are black, and who were tear-gassed 
by more than two dozen officers summoned to the scene by the social workers. 
Twelve people, including a 7-year-old child, later filed civil lawsuits against 
the city. All were settled out of court, with the city paying from a few 
hundred dollars to thousands of dollars in each case, Hopkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCullough himself was charged with battery on a police officer and resisting 
arrest. In February, 1992, he was found innocent of battery but guilty of 
resisting arrest. He was placed on probation. 
</P>
<P>
 During McCullough's civil trial against the city, former Pasadena Police 
Officer Donald Gallon testified that McCullough attacked him, forcing him to 
subdue McCullough. Gallon said McCullough later told police that he had not 
taken his medication and that he had overheard police say that Hitler had told 
them to come and get him. 
</P>
<P>
 McCullough, a former construction worker who testified in court wearing battle 
fatigues with a general's emblem, said that he had worn the woman's robe the 
day of the picnic to entertain children at the family reunion. Further, he 
testified that his condition did not require daily medication and that Gallon 
attacked him from behind without provocation. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury found that Gallon did not intentionally use force to cause harm, thus 
the city was not liable for McCullough's injuries nor was McCullough due 
punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the jury decided Gallon did assault McCullough, causing him back 
injuries and bruises equivalent to $118,000.

FOR PARENTS: NEW MUSEUM OFFERS A LESSON IN FUN FOR LITTLE LEARNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN E. KLEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of tussling 4-year-old boys careened down a slide. Two toddlers pulled 
a miniature stagecoach. And a group of giggling older children tossed hay 
around. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening weekend at the 6,200-square-foot Little Learners Children's Museum 
brought hundreds of children and their parents in for a look around. Friday 
night, during Monrovia's Family Festival, the center was filled to capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 "My whole staff really had to run around just to keep up with the crowd," said 
Miriam Justice, a longtime Pasadena resident, public school teacher and 
educational psychologist who started the museum venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Little Learners grew out of a family day-care center Justice ran out of her 
home for three years. "I learned a lot from those kids. What they need, what 
they like, what makes them happy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The result at her family-owned business combines elements of a toy and gift 
shop and a preschool playroom. 
</P>
<P>
 It does not have the kinds of large, hands-on climbing and exploring exhibits 
or science demonstrations found at many other local children's museums, such as 
Kidspace in Pasadena. Instead, the Little Learners format divides its space 
into eight playrooms filled with toys and posters; the center will offer 
classes in each room. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the fire station is not set up like a model station, with the 
fire pole and old fire engine to climb on that you might expect at a museum. 
Rather, it features toy firetrucks and firemen. Classes will teach fire safety 
and earthquake preparedness. Similarly, the post office has some toy mail 
trucks and small toy mailboxes, but no hands-on sorting stations or mock-up of 
a real mailbox or mailbags. A future class will teach children how to write and 
mail a letter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Space Room features a glow-in-the-dark sky full of stars and planets 
placed in a random pattern rather than a genuine imitation of a real night sky. 
</P>
<P>
 In the back, Grandma's Kitchen offers snacks and tables for parents and 
children to sit and rest a while. 
</P>
<P>
 What: Little Learners Children's Museum  
</P>
<P>
 Where: 601 S. Myrtle Ave., Monrovia  
</P>
<P>
 When: 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays; 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Fridays and 
Saturdays  
</P>
<P>
 How much: $4 adults, $3 senior citizens and children ages 2 through 12. Kids 
under 2 are free. Classes will start at $3 a session.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY / COVER STORY; MUCH A-DOO DAH; THE ZANY PARADE WITH THE 
UN-ROSY OUTLOOK IS BACK DESPITE PROTESTS BY MERCHANTS AND OTHER PROBLEMS 
</P>

 The Doo-Dah Disaster is a pathetically unimaginative hodgepodge of thrift-shop 
assemblages providing a background, and excuse, for a mawkish exhibition of 
public cavorting by welfare beneficiaries who should be seeking employment. -- 
Letter to the Pasadena Star-News, 1979 
</P>
<P>
 The Doo Dah Parade is a type of ritual activity called a "rite of reversal," 
which anthropologists have found to occur in many societies. . . . Through 
caricature and parody, standing the world on its head, participants playfully 
convey serious messages at which observers may not legitimately take offense."  
</P>
<P>
 -- 1982 study by Denise Lawrence, director 
</P>
<P>
 Center for Visual Anthropology, USC 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not everybody loves an anti-parade. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1978, Doo Dah Parade founder Peter Apanel has single-handedly put 
together an annual spoof of the Rose Parade that refuses to die, even though 
some people wished it would and thought it had (may its Lost Sock Brigade find 
its way to that great dryer in the sky). 
</P>
<P>
 Not even its Church of the Ornamental Lawn Decorations entry -- dedicated to 
pink flamingos -- was thought to have a prayer. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Hold the bugler's taps -- there's a funky drum roll on the horizon. Or is it 
the faint heartbeat of a wounded animal, tired of being shot at and ready to 
strike again? 
</P>
<P>
 Doo Dah -- by the seat of its too-loud pants -- is ready to march forward, 
even though it makes no money, a group of Old Pasadena merchants circulated a 
petition against it and last year's switch to a smaller, ticketed event near 
City Hall was a bust. 
</P>
<P>
 All this led to premature speculation about its demise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, the biggest issue we have is getting people to know we're back," 
said Apanel, a 43-year-old South Pasadena resident. "A lot of people thought 
last year was the end . . . Clearly, it didn't work (last year)." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's event is Doo Dah redux, part II, starting at 11:30 a.m. on Nov. 
27. The parade will move in a new, faster format, free-of-charge and back in 
the streets of Old Pasadena, with a post-event festival from 1:30 to 4:30 p.m. 
in Memorial Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Light-Bringer Project, a Pasadena nonprofit arts organization, is 
co-sponsoring the parade and festival as part of an effort to recruit more 
local entries and bolster Doo Dah's community spirit, Apanel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Old favorites will be back, such as the Torment of Roses and in-drag West 
Hollywood Cheerleaders. New community entries will come from several sources, 
including Caltech, the Art Center College of Design and King's Village housing 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes Apanel shakes his head at the absurdity of it all -- the 
divisiveness over an event that was conceived on a bar stool and then grew into 
a monstrous undertaking, with 40,000 spectators and live TV coverage in its 
heyday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a parade," he says in those moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever it is -- and for whatever anthropological reasons -- Doo Dah evokes a 
love-it-or-hate-it reaction at the drop of a rose petal. 
</P>
<P>
 Some merchants say it's bad for business and provokes antics such as 
spectators throwing tortillas at paraders, a Doo Dah tradition gone awry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel it's been pushed down our throats," said Mark Matrese, manager of 
Cityscapes furniture store on Colorado Boulevard. "We feel it has absolutely no 
redeeming value whatsoever. . . . This parade has not generated any money for 
local businesses. It litters. It (creates) traffic problems. It's out of hand. 
. . . I've seen flying tortillas slam off the (store) windows." 
</P>
<P>
 Other merchants say they do business like gangbusters on Doo Dah days. 
</P>
<P>
 At Market City Caffe on South Fair Oaks Avenue, co-owner Chipper Pastron said 
Doo Dah is his biggest day of the year, busier even than during the World Cup, 
Rose Bowl or Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Spectators) get done with the parade, and they patronize the local 
businesses because they know them," Pastron said. "In my opinion, the Doo Dah 
Parade is everything we want in this area. It's a Pasadena event. It was 
created here. It's a family event. . . . The most important thing about this is 
just the idea of a parade, something fun and funky and home grown." 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, along the way, the parade -- which Apanel describes as Little Rascals 
meets Fellini -- turned political. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been the worst year ever in terms of politics and financial 
hassles," groaned Apanel, who runs the parade as his full-time job and 
occasionally takes on part-time work to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
 After last year's bust at City Hall, many thought Doo Dah was done and 
overdone -- stick a fork in it. That was fine with some merchants in Old 
Pasadena, who said it killed not only business but the area's tony image as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction was swift and vehement among anti-Doo Dah forces when word got around 
that the parade was back. 
</P>
<P>
 Apanel didn't get his parade permit until last week -- only two weeks before 
show time -- as he and city officials wrangled over details such as 
requirements and fees for security, cleanup and street closures. City officials 
tried to keep the merchants' objections in mind, said Robert Baderian, 
recreation and parks director. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 members of the Old Pasadena Business and Professional Assn. -- 
one-third of the group -- had signed a petition asking the city to deny Apanel 
a parade permit, said Ray Leier, association president. 
</P>
<P>
 But Apanel contends that only a few conservative merchants are against him and 
that many told him they were pressured to sign the petition or misunderstood 
what they were signing. 
</P>
<P>
 The association and Apanel accuse each other of refusing to compromise and 
work together. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the objections, for instance, is the parade's timing, on the Sunday 
after Thanksgiving, the busiest shopping weekend of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Apanel denies that Doo Dah is bad for business and that the post-Thanksgiving 
weekend is as big a shopping weekend as merchants say it is. Doo Dah, he said, 
is traditionally held on that Sunday, and regulars anticipate that date every 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 In an April meeting, Apanel said he offered to negotiate the date with 
association officials, but they refused to listen. But Jack Smith, a past 
association president, said it was Apanel who refused to listen. 
</P>
<P>
 "He should have made plans and worked with merchants a long time ago," said 
Smith, owner of California Basket Co. on Raymond Avenue. "Peter's here one day 
a year. I'm here 365 days a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Countered Apanel: "What they really want is a segregated, high-end theme park 
in Old Pasadena." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the parade is going forward, Leier said, the association wants to 
make peace and forge a working relationship before plans for a 1995 Doo Dah get 
under way. In fact, the association's radio ads for Old Pasadena's Holiday Open 
House even plug Doo Dah as part of the area's Thanksgiving weekend event 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can't fight 'em, join 'em," said Leier, a former Doo Dah Parade 
participant himself. "Now I say, do we continue to fight? Or do we say, 'Let's 
make it a good parade and let's try to deal with (concerns) next year.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Apanel says he has tinkered with Doo Dah's format in response to the 
merchants' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the parade's free-wheeling spirit had prompted a few 
spectators to get out of hand. Some have thrown marshmallows and mucked up the 
streets with stringy aerosol spray foam. In 1992, the City Council passed the 
"Silly String ordinance," aimed at banning such behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, in an effort to gain more control, Apanel decided to charge 
admission, limit attendance to 5,000 and cut the number of parade entries in 
half to 50, having them march in a loop around City Hall Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 But his plan backfired. The parade drew a disappointing 2,500 spectators and 
30 entries. Admission was $7 in advance and $10 on Doo Dah day, but revenue was 
barely enough to cover expenses, let alone make up for the loss of KCOP-TV's 
contract fee to broadcast the parade. (The TV station had opted not to televise 
the parade in its new format; Apanel declines to say how much money was 
involved in that contract.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This year, to push the event along faster, Doo Dah will be more of a 
Renaissance Faire-style procession, with the entries moving together as a group 
rather than as a consecutive parade. 
</P>
<P>
 It will end at a party in Memorial Park, with performance artists and 
musicians, including Dread Zeppelin, a reggae band with a lead singer dressed 
as Elvis. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers are expected to join in the revelry. Streets will close only when 
the entourage passes, rather than for the duration of the parade. 
</P>
<P>
 That way, the theory goes, crowds will leave less of a mess and block 
storefronts for only a short time. At the same time, Apanel's expenses will be 
reduced because fewer police officers and portable toilets will be required. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, with more local entries, Apanel said, the event is less likely to get 
out of control. In the past, he said, a few outsiders with no regard for the 
community have misinterpreted the parade as an excuse for mindless partying. 
</P>
<P>
 Apanel contends, however, that Doo Dah's wild reputation is unfounded. In 17 
parades, there has not been a single arrest, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena Police Lt. Rick Law said records are unavailable on whether police 
have made any arrests during Doo Dah's entire history, although he said he does 
not recall any arrests in the parade's last couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, Law said, police have kept with the parade's generally good-natured 
spirit. This year, however, police will no longer tolerate illegal activities 
such as drinking in public and throwing tortillas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to curtail and quell some of those activities," Law said. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of this year's 75 entries come from community groups, including a 
children's entry from King's Village, a federally funded, low-income housing 
project in Pasadena. The project's entry includes a stuffed dragon -- made of 
tin cans, old material and pasteboard -- and a drill team, said Ralph Poole, 
the project's program coordinator. The children are so excited that they are 
rehearsing on Saturdays, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Poole said, he was wary of Doo Dah's raunchy reputation, but he was 
happy to be included once he heard about the community emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "For my children who live in King's Village, there's a sort of alienation, of 
always being left out," he said. "If you think about it, the chances of any of 
these kids ever participating in a Rose Parade is a long shot at best. . . . We 
don't have to be involved in the raunchiness, but we can still be part of the 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Doo Dah is a chance to meet neighbors and be goofy at the same time, a Main 
Street-of-the-'90s vibe, said Thomas Coston, director of the Light-Bringer 
Project, the event's co-sponsor.

 "Not to cast spears at the Rose Parade, but (Doo Dah) is participatory. . . . 
People want to feel part of something. It's a connecting force," said Coston, 
who was an urban cowboy in the first Doo Dah, playing Jimi Hendrix tunes on an 
accordion. 
</P>
<P>
 Doo Dah started out as a simple little venture that Apanel dreamed up with 
friends in a bar in 1977 as a Rose Parade alternative -- no theme, no judging, 
no prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 Apanel, who has a degree in political science from Cal State Los Angeles, 
decided to do just that, organizing the first event in his spare time after 
working nights as a hospital orderly. After a few years, the parade started 
taking up so much time that Apanel quit his job to work on Doo Dah full time. 
Soon, Doo Dah-style parades sprung up nationwide in such places as Washington, 
D.C.; Columbus, Ohio, and Ocean City, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Apanel, who is single and lives in a studio apartment, said he 
barely broke even the past couple of years and never made more than $20,000 for 
a year's work on the parade. This year, he expects to lose money.  
</P>
<P>
 His revenue will come mostly from an undisclosed settlement with KCOP-TV, 
which originally had signed a contract to broadcast this year's parade but 
reneged when the sales staff could not sell enough ads. Apanel, who is charging 
no entry fee, will sell program ads and T-shirts and request donations from 
participants. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledges that, in the past couple of years, Doo Dah's problems have 
chased away some regular entries, such as the Synchronized Briefcase Drill 
Team, which will not be returning this year, as well as some longtime fans. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Apanel also concedes that he is tired of the hassles, of living without a 
steady income. He has no business cards and works out of his apartment. For a 
change of pace, he walks down the street to Buster's coffeehouse on Mission 
Street and plops down at his regular window seat to do his best thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 At Buster's, he pulls out a single piece of yellow legal paper from his pocket 
-- folded exactly the same way, every time -- and the same red pen to scribble 
notes. He has two cups of coffee -- three is too much -- and tries to work 
through the day's headaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't ask Apanel about next year's Doo Dah; he's just trying to get through 
this year's. 
</P>
<P>
 But he can't seem to bring himself to walk away from it. 
</P>
<P>
 He points to the USC anthropology study on Doo Dah's reason for being. 
</P>
<P>
 "You thought we were just being silly," he deadpanned, "but we're following 
the rite of human nature. It's not just a good idea. It's (natural) law." Doo 
Dah '94 
</P>
<P>
 When: Nov. 27, the Sunday after Thanksgiving. 
</P>

goes west one block on Holly, south one block on Fair Oaks Avenue, west two 
blocks on Union Street, south one block on Pasadena Avenue, east three blocks 
on Colorado Boulevard and north two blocks on Raymond, ending up back at the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 Format: Doo Dah will move in a mingled procession, with spectators expected to 
join in, so the streets won't be blocked for the duration of the event. 
Afterward, performance groups and the reggae band Dread Zeppelin will perform 
at the park. 
</P>

COMMUNITY NEWS: REGION; COUNTY LIBRARIES RESTORING HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many South Bay libraries were expanding their services beginning this week 
after almost two years of reduced hours, scaled-back library staffs and slashed 
materials budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 An injection of $22.5 million into the Los Angeles County Library system 
budget by the Board of Supervisors last month made it possible to restore hours 
and services to libraries in Gardena, Lawndale, Lomita, Manhattan Beach, 
Hawthorne and Lennox. 
</P>
<P>
 Library officials say a lack of staff has delayed restoring hours at libraries 
in Carson and Hermosa Beach, although officials expect to have them running on 
full schedule by the end of the month.  
</P>
<P>
 The new funds will mean more librarians to handle special requests, new 
reference books and materials at most libraries, plus updated technical and 
clinical guides at the library's resource and research centers, said library 
spokeswoman Jean Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
 Library officials were forced to cut hours, staff and materials two years ago 
when state officials shifted funds away from county governments -- and thus the 
library budget -- to other areas. That money, which accounted for almost half 
of the library system's budget, has not been replaced by the state, Alexander 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the county has given the library district several million dollars 
a year but not enough to cover a continued drain of library revenues by the 
state, Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
 Late this summer, library officials attended city council meetings asking 
councils to approve a special tax to keep the system solvent. The tax, which 
would have cost homeowners about $28.50 a year, was overwhelmingly turned down 
by the South Bay cities that voted on it. Carson and Lomita approved the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 But county officials bailed out the library system. Library officials say the 
money will only last through June, and county officials have pledged to give 
only $10 million next year. Expanded Library Hours 
</P>
<P>
 The county library system is increasing the number of days and the hours its 
branches will be open.

DEFENSE PLANS TO QUERY ITO'S WIFE AT HEARING; TRIAL: SIMPSON'S ATTORNEYS WANT 
TO DETERMINE IF POLICE CAPT. MARGARET YORK TOOK PART IN AN INQUIRY INVOLVING A 
CONTROVERSIAL DETECTIVE IN THE CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lawyers for O.J. Simpson hope to question the wife of Superior Court Judge 
Lance A. Ito at a special hearing next week to determine whether she was 
involved in an internal LAPD investigation of a detective who discovered key 
evidence in the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito's wife, Capt. Margaret York, is the highest-ranking woman in the Police 
Department. In 1985, she was assigned to the LAPD's West Los Angeles station, 
where Detective Mark Fuhrman was then a police officer and where he now works 
on the homicide desk. Fuhrman, the detective who said he found a bloody glove 
outside Simpson's Brentwood mansion a few hours after the bodies of Nicole 
Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman were discovered, has been the subject of 
an aggressive defense campaign to discredit him. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Simpson attorney Robert L. Shapiro, York has volunteered to 
testify at next week's hearing. Shapiro added that Superior Court Judge Curtis 
Rappe, will preside over the session to avoid creating a conflict for Ito. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro did not specify what internal investigation York would be asked about, 
but sources told The Times in July that Fuhrman came under scrutiny for his 
alleged affiliation with an informal group of officers at the West Los Angeles 
station known as MAW -- short for Men Against Women. The existence of that 
group, whose proponents were said to deride the abilities of female police 
officers, became known in the early 1980s. A subsequent investigation led to 
its dissolution, though police sources say remnants of it persist today. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Fuhrman was at the station where York was assigned in 1985 when 
she was promoted to lieutenant and given her first post as a watch commander. 
Although a television tabloid show said last month that York was involved in 
running that internal investigation, people familiar with the inquiry said 
Wednesday that the televised report was incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation, sources said, was not handled by station officials but by 
the department's Office of Operations and its Internal Affairs Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said York was aware of the inquiry, but they added that it was largely 
concluded by the time she arrived at the station. They stressed that she was 
not involved in it except to be interviewed as a possible witness. She did not 
accuse Fuhrman of any wrongdoing but rather praised his work, the sources 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Retired Police Chief Daryl F. Gates assigned York to the post in West Los 
Angeles and said Wednesday that she had favorable comments about Fuhrman. "She 
was satisfied with his work, thought he was a hard-working guy," Gates said. 
"She considered him highly sought after because he was an aggressive, competent 
officer, and she was very pleased with him." 
</P>
<P>
 According to sources, Fuhrman's name surfaced briefly in connection with an 
internal LAPD audit of the West Los Angeles station this year. That audit was 
launched in an effort to root out sexual harassment at the station; it has been 
completed and some officers have been transferred out of West Los Angeles to 
improve the working environment at the station. 
</P>
<P>
 But those same sources said Fuhrman is no longer considered a target of the 
West Los Angeles inquiry and is not expected to face internal charges growing 
out of it. Police Chief Willie L. Williams, who received the audit, has 
publicly stated his faith in Fuhrman and the other detectives involved in the 
Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Simpson's attorneys want to question York and may seek to 
discover whether she was involved in any investigation of Fuhrman. If so, it 
could raise the possibility that she would be called as a witness in Simpson's 
trial, raising the specter of a possible conflict for Ito. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may be some conflict of interest," Shapiro said, though he stressed 
that he was not aware of any conflict and that defense attorneys are not 
seeking Ito's removal from the case. Shapiro described Monday's session as a 
"fact-finding hearing." 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's a possibility she could be a witness," Shapiro added, "we want to 
know those things before trial, so no one will be embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
 Citing a 1983 pension case filed by Fuhrman, Simpson's lawyers have accused 
the detective of harboring racist views, a contention that Fuhrman's lawyer 
vehemently denies. The defense sought access to police records relating to 
Fuhrman, but after reviewing them, Ito found that there was nothing relevant to 
the Simpson case and denied their request to view the records themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie Levenson, a Loyola University law professor who has closely followed 
the Simpson case, said that before defense attorneys could call York to the 
stand during the trial, they would need to show that she has something relevant 
to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first threshold is does she know anything," Levenson said. "If she knows 
anything, could her information be allowed in the case?" 
</P>
<P>
 Allowing York to testify at the trial would potentially be problematic if Ito 
were presiding, Levenson and others said. Normally, a judge would not be 
allowed to preside over his own spouse's testimony, but defense attorneys early 
on in the case waived objections to Ito's selection based on possible conflicts 
created by his relationship with York, which was disclosed before he was picked 
to try the case. 
</P>
<P>
 If defense attorneys could show that York was needed as a material witness at 
the trial, theoretically they could move to excuse Ito. But that tactic would 
risk antagonizing Ito and, if successful, would set back Simpson's insistence 
on a speedy trial and throw open the doors to the appointment of any judge in 
the Superior Court -- a risky gambit with potentially dire consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to think about this," Levenson said. "You have to be careful what 
you wish for." 
</P>
<P>
 In court, meanwhile, jury selection continued with four candidates for 
alternate juror service accepted and two excused, including one who was 
dismissed after he described the murder of his brother, who was stabbed to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 That prospective juror, a 29-year-old black man from North Hollywood, did not 
mention his brother's violent death on the exhaustive questionnaire that all 
jury candidates were required to complete in September. As a result, his 
disclosure in court Wednesday seemed to take Ito and the lawyers by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 They questioned him closely about the incident, with Shapiro at one point 
asking whether he would be able to examine crime scene photographs of the 
stabbed and slashed bodies of Nicole Simpson and Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can deal with it," he said. "I have a strong heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, that man was excused, becoming the 19th alternate jury candidate 
dismissed since questioning of those people began last week -- by day's end, 
one more was excused, bringing the total to 20. Just 15 have been cleared for 
further service, and they will return Dec. 5, when lawyers for both sides will 
begin exercising peremptory challenges to weed out panelists with whom they 
feel uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 The process has moved with glacial speed in recent days but picked up 
Wednesday when Ito imposed a time limit on the lawyers for their questioning 
and placed a clock in the courtroom to monitor their compliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Two panelists who were allowed to remain in the pool of prospective alternates 
said they had initially believed that Simpson probably was guilty of the 
slayings, but both insisted that they could be fair. One, a 37-year-old Latina 
from West Los Angeles, said she had initially concluded that he committed the 
murders and that she viewed his nationally televised low-speed trek across 
Orange County and Los Angeles as a sign that he was fleeing prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 But that woman said that she could be fair and that she no longer was 
convinced of Simpson's guilt: "It could be true," she said, "but anything could 
be true." 
</P>
<P>
 Another woman interviewed Wednesday, a 28-year-old Pico Rivera real estate 
appraiser, said she believed that Simpson was the only person with an apparent 
motive to kill Nicole Simpson, but also said that she did not consider DNA 
evidence infallible. Prosecutors expect to introduce an array of blood samples, 
some of which have been subjected to DNA tests, in their effort to link Simpson 
to the crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
 That woman said she too could be fair. She was allowed to stay on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 The session Wednesday marked the third day in a row that prospective jurors 
have said they saw advertisements for a televised interview that a local 
television station conducted with Ito and that is being broadcast all week. 
Commentators have expressed bewilderment and surprise that Ito agreed to that 
interview, and on Wednesday, Ito, who has urged jurors to avoid all publicity 
about the case, said he now had some regrets -- if not about the interview, at 
least about the station's intensity in publicizing it. 
</P>
<P>
 When one prospective juror said she had seen a newspaper ad touting the 
station's talk with the judge, Ito responded: "If I had known they were going 
to do that, I wouldn't have done that" interview.

COLD FRONT WHIPS UP WINDS AND HAVOC; WEATHER: ICY GUSTS DAMAGE PROPERTY, DOWN 
POWER LINES AND FAN A BRUSH FIRE.

 Trees were felled, wires were downed and roofs were lifted from their rafters 
Wednesday as high winds blasted Southern California in the wake of a cold front 
and scattered showers. 
</P>
<P>
 The winds, which gusted as high as 50 m.p.h. at Edwards Air Force Base, did 
not cause any reported injuries, officials said. But they did wreak havoc on 
property and utilities and made the winter fire season a little tougher for 
fire crews. 
</P>
<P>
 In Vernon, a 25 m.p.h.-plus gust yanked chunks of a roof from an industrial 
warehouse on Fruitland Avenue, then dropped them on a stretch of nearby parked 
cars, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 James Smith, a Vernon Fire Department battalion chief, said the damage to the 
cars was minor but that fire crews stayed busy for much of the afternoon 
cleaning up the debris. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hacienda Heights, Los Angeles County firefighters battled a 10-acre brush 
fire fanned by the high winds. Fire Inspector Brian Jordan said the blaze, at 
Colima Road and Casino Drive, was extinguished in about half an hour with the 
help of one of the county's on-loan Super Scooper planes. None of the nearby 
homes was threatened or damaged, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scattered power outages were reported across the county as wires were blown 
down in Hollywood, Downtown Los Angeles, South-Central, El Sereno, Eagle Rock, 
Long Beach and Santa Fe Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Peters, a spokesman for Southern California Edison, said about 1,300 
customers in Long Beach were without power for three hours Wednesday afternoon, 
and a second outage affected hundreds of residents during the evening in Santa 
Fe Springs. County fire crews also reported dozens of downed power lines in the 
areas surrounding Whittier and Hacienda Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Denne, spokeswoman for the Department of Water and Power, said about 
8,000 Los Angeles customers in about a dozen neighborhoods were left without 
electricity for at least part of Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Denne added that the outages were "all in small pockets," and were expected to 
be corrected by midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, winds knocked down an abandoned bar in Placentia and whipped 
a small brush fire in Brea Canyon, county fire dispatchers said. The fire, 
which broke out just after noon near Tonner Road and the Orange Freeway, 
prompted the brief closure of the northbound Tonner Road off-ramp before it was 
extinguished. Fire officials said a downed power line might have set off the 
blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the region, wind advisories continued during the night for desert 
and mountain regions. Warnings were particularly aimed at the Mojave Desert, 
where drivers were advised to look out for dust storms and powerful gusts. 
Peters of Southern California Edison said one gust in Palm Springs downed 
enough power lines to knock out power to 1,300 customers, including the Marquis 
Hotel and the Fashion Plaza Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Brack, meteorologist for WeatherData Inc., said the winds were not the 
usual Santa Anas common in Southern California. Rather, he said, they were the 
aftermath of a cold front that moved through Wednesday morning, dampening the 
area with scattered pre-dawn rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Brack said the winds also were fueled by the jet stream flowing over Southern 
California's upper atmosphere. The gusts were expected to die down by midday 
today in most areas, although the mountains and high deserts will still be 
fairly windy, Brack said. 
</P>
<P>
 Skies in the Los Angeles area, he said, will be mostly sunny Thursday with 
highs in the upper 50s and low 60s.

5 1/2 TONS OF COCAINE SEIZED IN DEA STING; DRUGS: THE UNDERCOVER BUST 
ELIMINATES A NETWORK SUSPECTED OF TRANSPORTING DRUGS FROM MEXICO TO RIVERSIDE 
COUNTY AND INTO THE LOS ANGELES AREA, OFFICIALS SAY. FOURTEEN ARE ARRESTED. 
</P>

 When the two undercover Drug Enforcement Administration agents in Arizona 
received the shipment of 11,000 pounds of high-grade Colombian cocaine from 
across the Mexican border last week, their job -- carrying out the largest 
undercover cocaine bust in U.S. history -- was just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 They loaded the $500 million worth of drugs onto their tractor trailer and 
drove it from Tucson to Riverside County, where it was eventually deposited at 
a posh ranch authorities say is owned by one of the Mexican cells of the 
notorious Cali drug cartel. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, authorities say, the 5 1/2 tons of cocaine were being split up into 
five batches, each to be shipped in a van or pickup truck to a nearby stash 
house, where other narcotics traffickers would distribute them. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when the feds, and dozens of state and local law enforcement officers, 
pounced. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 a.m. more than 100 law enforcement officers made 14 arrests after 
raiding sites in Riverside County and West Covina. They confiscated the cocaine 
along with nearly a dozen firearms, including several semiautomatic weapons, 
authorities announced Wednesday. When law enforcement officers burst through 
the door at the ranch, the main stash site, they were greeted with nine rounds 
of fire from an AK-47. No officers were injured, but a suspect was wounded in 
the leg. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people were a very well-connected organization," said Robert Bender, 
special agent in charge of the Los Angeles DEA office. "Their bad luck was that 
they got connected with federal law enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
 That connection began almost six months ago, Bender said, when a DEA 
undercover agent and a West Covina police officer on loan to the federal agency 
began to build a relationship with Mexican cocaine traffickers looking for a 
way to get their drugs across the Arizona border, and to the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 The agents posed as truckers willing to run drugs to California, Bender said, 
but it took a long time to earn the traffickers' trust. "Things like this don't 
happen overnight," Bender said. 
</P>
<P>
 They had won that trust by last week, when the drug smugglers paid them a 
$2-million advance to drive their haul to the Southland. The drugs were 
smuggled across the border in vans driven into Nogales, Ariz., and were then 
taken to Tucson, where the agents loaded them on their truck, bound for 
Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
 This is standard operating procedure for traffickers, Bender said. "We did 
this in the same fashion as the bad guys do it all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was to arrest the Southland distributors of the drugs, Bender said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles becomes the western warehouse for narcotics smuggled across the 
border as far east as El Paso," said Bill Meglen, U.S. Customs special agent in 
charge of the U.S. Customs office in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest cocaine bust in Los Ageles history, and one of the nation's 
largest as well, occurred in September, 1989, when 21.4 tons of cocaine were 
seized from a Sylmar warehouse. But this week's bust was the largest undercover 
seizure in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say Mexican authorities have been notified, and that the 
investigation is continuing in that country with the aid of Mexico City's 
Federal Judicial Police. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve of the 14 suspects, one of whom remains at large, face life in prison 
if they are convicted, U.S. Atty. Nora Manella said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We basically eliminated a cell," Bender said, acknowledging that there are 
many other such operations smuggling cocaine into Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials were savoring how they had duped the alleged traffickers. Noting 
that the undercover agents had been promised $1.5 million more after the drugs 
were moved from Riverside County, Bender said: "They still owe us."

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY: SLOWING DOWN FOR THE RICH AND FAMOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As the search for the perfect jury in the O.J. Simpson case plods on, you 
might wonder whatever happened to the much-heralded Proposition 115, which 
California voters passed four years ago to speed up this very process. 
</P>
<P>
 The Proposition 115 backers were a group of prosecutors and cops who, unhappy 
at losing criminal cases, dreamed up a way of tilting the rules toward their 
side. Their idea of a perfect juror was someone who would vote for conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, the hottest item on the June, 1990, primary ballot, was sort of 
the Proposition 187 of its day. True, Proposition 115 didn't have the 
far-reaching impact of 187. It didn't kick children out of school or turn 
teachers into secret police. Still, the initiative had something in common with 
our new immigration law. They both dominated the election campaign. Like 187, 
Proposition 115 offered a simplistic solution to an incredibly complex problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Voter approval of Proposition 115 was the culmination of a decades-long 
political battle between the prosecutors and a liberal state Supreme Court and 
Legislature. The high court had been interpreting the law in favor of 
defendants' rights. 
</P>
<P>
 As public concern over crime increased, prosecutorial anger spread to the 
voters, especially during the tenure of Chief Justice Rose Bird. Delays in big 
cases exacerbated public anger. For example, it took six months in 1988 and 
1989 to pick a jury to try Night Stalker Richard Ramirez, accused of serial 
murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislative efforts to change the court's decisions were blocked in the 
Assembly by the committee in charge of criminal law. Frustrated, the 
prosecutors went to the initiative, which passed overwhelmingly. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure brought many California criminal statutes into conformity with 
federal laws, which tend to be much less friendly to defendants. It became 
easier for cops to search suspects. Obstacles were lifted to prosecutors having 
access to defense evidence. Prosecutors who had complained of delaying tactics 
by defense attorneys were assured of speedy trials. 
</P>
<P>
 The questioning of prospective jurors -- voir dire -- was taken out of the 
hands of lawyers, who tended to linger over their questions. Judges would do 
the questioning unless there was good cause for the attorneys to participate. 
This was one of 115's most important speedy trial provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I wrote about the campaign and the importance of Proposition 115 as an 
election issue. But, as is the unfortunate habit of political writers, I didn't 
follow the new law once it entered the statute books. The excitement of 
covering a campaign is usually more stimulating than the drudgery of tracking 
implementation. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Simpson trial, I'm getting a look at post-115 justice and it doesn't 
look much different. 
</P>
<P>
 While Judge Lance A. Ito questions prospective jurors, as 115 requires, he 
also turns voir dire over to the prosecutors and defense attorneys for long 
periods in which they work over each jury candidate in the manner of a 
combination detective-psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, the judge put time limits on the questioning to speed up the 
process. But the questioning of a panelist before the noon break stretched on 
and on.  
</P>
<P>
 When I got back from the courthouse in the afternoon, I called Los Angeles 
County Deputy Dist. Atty. Ernie Norris, who was one of the authors of 
Proposition 115. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked what happened to the speedy trial provisions. I didn't think lawyers 
were supposed to be asking all those questions. 
</P>
<P>
 They're not, Norris replied. "What Ito is doing is way beyond the bounds of 
propriety," he said. Ito, he said, was allowing the questioning because of the 
trial's publicity, the media spotlight on the courtroom and "the pressure of 
defense attorneys to hold him to be fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Norris said he is currently prosecuting a similar case in Pasadena -- a double 
murder, just like the Simpson trial -- where the judge allowed him 10 minutes 
to question prospective jurors, and the defense attorneys 20 minutes. There, 
with the defendant unknown and poor, Proposition 115 is being implemented the 
way Norris said it should be.  
</P>
<P>
 I talked to Art Goldberg, a defense attorney who represents many poor 
defendants in the same Criminal Courts Building where Simpson is on trial. He 
agreed with Norris. 
</P>
<P>
 'A few judges will let you go for 20 or 30 minutes (on juror questioning)," he 
said. "The normal 95% (of defendants) are rushed through like cattle." Speaking 
of the poverty and lack of celebrity of his clients, Goldberg said, "I don't 
have O.J. and the whole world isn't watching." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With Simpson, the world is watching. 
</P>
<P>
 The world media records every minor move of Judge Ito and the attorney. 
Inconsequential details become big news. The spotlight is on the L.A. judiciary 
and legal community. Everyone wants to look good, judge and lawyers alike. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Simpson is given every break in the law. Proposition 115 doesn't 
really apply to him. There's no speedup in the Simpson trial. The prosecution 
isn't permitted any shortcuts here. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked 115 author Ernie Norris about this. We talked by phone during a recess 
in his Pasadena double murder case. It was moving fast. Jury selection had 
taken just a day. Norris was happy about that.  
</P>
<P>
 I asked him if this was fair, the difference between how his case was being 
handled and the Simpson trial. Aren't we talking about two brands of post-115 
justice, one for the rich and famous, and one for the poor? "Absolutely," he 
said. "It's tragic. It shouldn't be done."

D.A. REOPENS PROBE IN DELORES JACKSON'S DEATH; INVESTIGATION: OFFICE ACTS IN 
RESPONSE TO A CORONER'S REPORT THAT SAID THE FORMER WIFE OF TITO JACKSON MAY 
HAVE DIED IN AN 'ASSISTED DROWNING.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Los Angeles County district attorney's office said Wednesday that it is 
reopening its investigation of the drowning of Delores Jackson, former wife of 
entertainer Tito Jackson and former sister-in-law of pop superstar Michael 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office acted in response to new evidence released 
Tuesday by coroner's officials, who said Jackson may have died of an "assisted 
drowning."  
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, 39, was pulled from the pool of her boyfriend, businessman Donald J. 
Bohana, at his home on Holt Avenue in Ladera Heights shortly before dawn Aug. 
27. Coroner's officials said cuts on her lip, tongue and ears, as well as a 
bruise on her head and a muscle hemorrhage in her neck, indicate "blunt-force 
traumatic injuries." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for the district attorney's office, said Bohana had 
not been arrested but also has not been ruled out as a suspect in Jackson's 
death. Phone calls to Bohana's home seeking comment were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial investigations by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies found the 
drowning to be accidental. But the new coroner's report said Jackson died of 
"asphyxia, due to or as a consequence of drowning, alcohol intake and 
blunt-force traumatic injuries." The report said her blood-alcohol level was 
0.22%, nearly three times the legal limit for drunken driving.  
</P>
<P>
 Jackson had been married to singer Tito Jackson for 16 years when they 
divorced in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibbons said the Sheriff's Department has turned over its preliminary 
investigation, which included interviews with witnesses, to the district 
attorney's office.  
</P>
<P>
 Bohana, who has had several financial problems in the past, including a failed 
insurance company, gained fame a few years ago when he opened the first 
sit-down restaurant in the Watts-Willowbrook area since the 1965 Watts riots.  
</P>
<P>
 He was the force behind the Denny's "N" the 'Hood on Wilmington Avenue in the 
Kenneth Hahn Shopping Plaza. The restaurant, which opened in September, 1992, 
was welcomed with open arms by a community starving for something beyond the 
fast-food spots that dominated the area. At that time, it was the first African 
American-owned Denny's in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 After noticing lagging sales at the restaurant in 1993, Bohana brought in chef 
Roy Cash, who spiced up the menu with collard greens, oxtails and other 
traditional Southern foods. Business picked up for a while, but began to sag 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years after the restaurant opened, Bohana was ousted as manager and 
Denny's officials took over the facility, saying Bohana had never made any 
payments on a $735,000 low-interest loan he used to build the restaurant. 
Officials from the national Denny's offices took over the restaurant in March 
and hired a new staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Bohana purchased the troubled California Life Insurance Co. in 1982, but in 
1988 the company was placed in conservatorship by the state, which cited the 
company as insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
 According to friends, Bohana has been an active member of the black community 
in Los Angeles for some time, belonging to the Urban League and 100 Black Men. 
They said he has hosted various fund-raising events at his home. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Bohana's closest friends, Guy Crowder, a photographer for Supervisor 
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, said he spoke to Bohana Wednesday morning. He said 
Bohana was not worried about any potential ramifications of the information 
that Jackson had bruises and cuts on her body at the time of her death. 
</P>
<P>
 "He seemed calm and willing to talk about everything," Crowder said. "(Bohana) 
believes he hasn't done anything wrong."

$1,000 and $10,000 for sexual favors while working for alleged Hollywood madam 
Heidi Fleiss. 
</P>
<P>
 Burdette, a leggy miniskirted brunette from Colorado, gave a Los Angeles 
Superior Court jury its first glimpse inside Fleiss' alleged prostitution ring 
since Fleiss' criminal trial began Monday. She said Fleiss dispatched her to a 
Beverly Hills hotel suite on two consecutive evenings in June, 1993, to meet a 
man who turned out to be an undercover detective. 
</P>
<P>
 Burdette frequently sought eye contact and exchanged knowing smiles with 
Fleiss, her former boss and friend, who is charged with pandering and 
possession of cocaine for sale. Appearing ill at ease, Burdette explained that 
under her business arrangement she gave Fleiss 40% of her earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Burdette's testimony followed a morning ruling by Judge Judith Champagne that 
Fleiss' defense attorneys cannot delve into the fact that Fleiss' alleged 
clients were not criminally charged -- a fact that Fleiss' lawyers say proves 
she has been unfairly targeted. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss' attorney, Anthony Brooklier, pointed out that police knew the 
identities of Fleiss' alleged clientele, said to include Tinseltown's top 
executives. He also noted that the alleged prostitutes, including Burdette, 
were given immunity in exchange for their testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Using this line of reasoning, Brooklier hoped to buttress his claim that 
Fleiss was entrapped in the electronically bugged Beverly Hills hotel room, and 
that Fleiss' alleged crime had no true victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss' arrest last year electrified Hollywood, leading to much speculation 
about names in her "black book." But Brooklier said that because neither he nor 
his client want to "ruin somebody's marriage" or "cause some child heartache," 
he had no intention of seeking the disclosure of supposed clients' identities. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss, a 28-year-old high school dropout, has pleaded not guilty to the 
charges. Dressed in a gray, pin-striped suit, she showed little emotion as 
Burdette, who said she often slept at Fleiss' Benedict Canyon home, took the 
stand.  
</P>
<P>
 On the evening of June 8, 1993, Fleiss "asked me if I wanted to go to the 
Beverly Hills Hilton," Burdette said haltingly in response to questions from 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Alan Carter. Fleiss directed her to meet a wealthy 
Ferrari-driving businessman from Hawaii who would pay her $1,500, Burdette 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if $1,500 was out of line with her usual wages, Burdette replied that 
she generally received anywhere from $1,000 to $10,000 for "sexual favors" with 
men. After several minutes of conversation, Burdette said, she and the man -- 
who turned out to be undercover Beverly Hills Detective Sammy Lee -- retreated 
to the suite bedroom, where she partially disrobed. At that point, Lee's beeper 
rang and he informed her that he had urgent business to attend. He asked her, 
she said, to bring cocaine the next night for a party with his business 
associates as well as three other women from Fleiss' circle. 
</P>
<P>
 That evening, Burdette testified, she gave Lee two small packets of cocaine 
and received cash from him for the drug as well as another $1,500 for sex. Lee 
and the other three men, also undercover police, "wanted us to do a dance" 
while disrobing, Burdette said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the women danced a few seconds, about 20 police burst into the room and 
arrested the women, Burdette said. By that time, Burdette said, she was naked 
-- though police have said all the women were partially clad.  
</P>
<P>
 Under cross-examination by Fleiss' co-counsel, Donald Marks, Burdette said Lee 
raised the issue of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night, Fleiss was released from the Pasadena-based drug rehabilitation 
program where she had resided for two months after drug tests, a term of her 
probation, indicated that she had used stimulants and depressants.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; GRANT WILL 
FUND HOMELESS CENTER EAST OF DOWNTOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan's plan to create a "drop-in center" for homeless people 
east of Downtown cleared another hurdle, as the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors accepted a government grant that would help fund the encampment. 
</P>
<P>
 With no discussion, the Board of Supervisors unanimously agreed Tuesday to 
accept a $20-million federal Housing and Urban Development grant to county and 
city agencies.One of the programs the grant is to fund is the homeless park. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan has outraged some homeless advocates, who referred to the project as 
an "internment camp." 
</P>
<P>
 The space, to be in a vacant lot, would include a 50-bed shelter, showers, 
restrooms, lockers and a service center where homeless people could receive 
drug and job counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's office said it planned to spend $4 million of the HUD grant on the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless advocate Alice Callaghan, a strong critic of the proposed drop-in 
center, said she did not attend the supervisor's meeting Tuesday because she 
figured the homeless plan was a "done deal." 
</P>
<P>
 "The supervisors clearly have abandoned any compassion for the poor in the 
city," said Callaghan, director of Las Familias del Pueblo, a Skid Row social 
service center. "I imagine a campground sounds like a nifty idea to them."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: VAN NUYS; STUDENT'S 
CONDITION CRITICAL AFTER STABBING NEAR SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 14-year-old Van Nuys Middle School student stabbed another 14-year-old 
student near the school Wednesday afternoon, and the victim was hospitalized in 
extremely critical condition, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the attacker ran up behind the victim as he was walking home 
from school and stabbed him once in the leg, said Detective John Edwards of the 
LAPD's Van Nuys division. 
</P>
<P>
 The witnesses, some of them other students, recognized the attacker and told 
police his name, Edwards said. Police waited for him at his home, where he 
walked up "with blood on him," Edwards said. The boy tried to flee, but was 
caught after a brief chase. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy later confessed to the stabbing, was arrested on suspicion of 
attempted murder and is being held at San Fernando Valley Juvenile Hall, 
Edwards said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PRINCIPAL, 3 TEACHERS 
FACE MISDEMEANOR ABUSE CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The principal and three former and current teachers at a small private school 
in South Pasadena are expected to surrender this week to face misdemeanor 
charges that they physically abused their pupils, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Judith Thayer, the principal and owner of the 130-student Stancliff School, 
was charged Monday with three counts of misdemeanor child abuse and a single 
count of failure to report child abuse, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Scott Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
 Her son, Andrew, 23, and Scott Kelly, 21, former gym teachers at the school, 
and JoAnne Lewis, 46, who still teaches at Stancliff, also were charged. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations capped an investigation that began 11 months ago after parents 
complained about disciplinary measures at the school, which offers classes from 
kindergarten through eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents complained that some discipline was unnecessarily harsh, and that 
Andrew Thayer -- also the school's football coach -- once had placed a football 
player in a trash dumpster and had put another boy's feet and lower legs in an 
ice machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Judith Thayer said then that the school occasionally punished unruly children 
by making them run laps or do pushups, but had not used corporal punishment for 
about eight years. The incidents involving her son, she said, were meant in fun 
-- one after a football victory and another on a hot summer day. 
</P>
<P>
 South Pasadena Police Chief Thomas E. Mahoney said that neither of those two 
incidents resulted in the charges filed this week. However, he said, during the 
course of the investigation, police unearthed other complaints from parents 
that led to the misdemeanor filings. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Mahoney nor Gordon would detail the incidents, but Mahoney said that 
in at least two cases children were injured -- although not seriously enough to 
require hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court documents, the alleged abuses occurred between last 
November and January, and involved six children. Two 7-year-olds and an 
8-year-old have accused Judith Thayer and Joanne Lewis of abusing them. A 
14-year-old girl and a 13-year-old boy have alleged that Andrew Thayer abused 
them and a 14-year-old boy charges that Judith Thayer and Kelly abused him. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahoney stressed that the allegations are "absolutely not" sexual in nature. 
"Most of it centers around disciplinary procedures at the school," the police 
chief said, adding that the actions involved were deemed by authorities to have 
been "unusual and inappropriate for a school setting." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Salz, the school's attorney, could not be reached for comment. SHAWN

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: RABIN CULTIVATES 
SUPPORT IN L.A. FOR PEACE EFFORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Bringing a message of Middle East peace and continued U.S. support of Israel, 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin met with leaders of the Jewish community and 
entertainment industry in Los Angeles on Wednesday to drum up support from 
American Jews for his country's peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to members of the Jewish Federation Council at the Century Plaza 
Hotel and Tower on Wednesday morning, Rabin talked about the strides that have 
been made against anti-Semitism.  
</P>
<P>
 "Today, if I look around, the danger, the physical danger, to a Jewish 
community because they are Jewish has diminished greatly," Rabin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime minister -- who later Wednesday received the 1994 Ronald Reagan 
Freedom Award at the Beverly Hilton hotel -- discussed the Israeli government's 
attempts to bring Jews to Israel from other world communities. Rabin said 
nearly 600,000 Jews relocated to Israel this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin took a hard stance against "Islamic radical extremists" who he said are 
attempting to daunt efforts at political harmony by Israel and other countries 
through terrorist acts. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are the enemies of peace," Rabin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Harvey Fields, committee chairman of community relations for the 
federation, said he appreciated Rabin's candor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really pleased," Fields said. "He was very forthright about Iran being 
the money source behind terrorist activities." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin also stressed the importance of American Jews visiting Israel and was 
there to witness the presentation of a $500,000 check to the federation from 
the Zeiglar Foundation. The money will be used as a beginning grant to aid 
American Jewish teen-agers who want to spend a summer in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Rabin's visit to Los Angeles is indicative of his desire to 
touch base with the American Jewish community while raising awareness about the 
need for cooperation and financial partnership between the United States and 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin's speech came the day before his visit to Denver, the site of a 
convention beginning today of Jewish federations from throughout the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the afternoon, Rabin attended a star-studded luncheon hosted by 
entertainment industry mogul David Geffen at Morton's in West Hollywood. The 
luncheon drew such celebrities as Barbra Streisand, Richard Dreyfuss, Warren 
Beatty, Annette Benning and Elizabeth Taylor, as well as studio heads and 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, Rabin shared the Reagan Freedom 
Award with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and Jordan's King Hussein. Ceremonies for 
Arafat and Hussein have not yet been arranged. Former First Lady Nancy Reagan 
presented the award to Rabin, but the former President, who disclosed Nov. 5 
that he has Alzheimer's disease, did not attend.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY 
COUNCIL REJECTS BILL FOR $5,000 FAREWELL PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday unanimously rejected a $5,095 bill 
for a city official's going-away luncheon and adopted a policy designed to 
block such charges in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The action stops payment for the retirement party two years ago for Harbor 
Commissioner Jun Mori, meaning that 60 current and former city employees, 
including former Mayor Tom Bradley, may be billed $78 each for the event. 
</P>
<P>
 The council supported a previous order by city Controller Rick Tuttle in 
blocking the payment to the catering firm that provided the lunch. Tuttle has 
been directed to work with Harbor Department general manager Ezunial Burts to 
devise a method for paying the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Burts had called the city-paid luncheon "legitimate and justifiable" because 
he said Mori had played a substantial role in building the port's business. But 
other city officials said that such events typically are paid for by those in 
attendance, not by the city treasury. Councilman Joel Wachs called the event "a 
pig-out at the public's expense." 
</P>
<P>
 Mori's 15-year tenure with the port was notable both for a huge expansion in 
container shipping business and for protests about his alleged conflicts of 
interest. Mori's law firm represented some of the ports largest tenants while 
he served on the commission that oversees its operations.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: BELLFLOWER; JURORS' 
NAMES ORDERED REVEALED IN 2ND SUCH CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Superior Court judge has ordered that the names of jurors in a Bellflower 
trial be revealed, marking the second time in two months that judges from the 
court's appellate branch have halted efforts by lower court judges to keep 
jurors' names secret. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's decision by Judge Abby Soven applies to a case before Bellflower 
Municipal Judge Philip K. Mautino.On Sept. 20, Judge Robert L. Roberson ruled 
that jurors' names must be revealed in a case before Downey Municipal Judge 
John David Lord.  
</P>
<P>
 The Downey case is scheduled for argument before a state appeals court Dec. 
21. Principal Deputy County Counsel Daniel E. McCoy, who represents both 
judges, said he will file a similar appeal in the Bellflower case. 
</P>
<P>
 Mautino and Lord have drawn national attention for their attempts to conduct 
criminal trials with anonymous juries. State law offers jurors anonymity once a 
trial is over, but the judges have said that the law is meaningless unless 
jurors can opt for anonymity at the beginning.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: ALHAMBRA; CHINESE 
AMERICANS WARNED OF WORK PERMIT SWINDLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Atty. James Hahn warned the Chinese American community 
Wednesday that a convicted swindler who just served time in jail for peddling 
bogus work permits is at it again. 
</P>
<P>
 Lo-Li V. Gregor, 48, was incarcerated this year for defrauding 14 people. But 
immigration officials discovered that she has resumed advertising in local 
Chinese-language newspapers to sell the phony documents.  
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said they believe Gregor has resumed her business in office 
buildings on West Mission Road in Alhambra and Wilshire Boulevard in Koreatown. 
</P>
<P>
 According to officials, the Alhambra con artist is targeting people with 
passports from Taiwan and Hong Kong. In the newspaper ads, she offers 
"reliable" and "legal" U.S. work permits. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, Municipal Judge Thomas L. Willhite sentenced her to a year in 
jail, placed her on five years probation and ordered her not to engage in any 
immigration activities during that time.  
</P>
<P>
 In that case, Gregor was convicted on 43 criminal counts of grand theft, 
making false and misleading statements, illegally engaging in immigration 
consulting and other business misconduct. She was released after serving four 
months in jail.

FURNITURE STORE TO EXPAND TO MALL; DEVELOPMENT: ANGELUS PARTNERSHIP'S PLANS 
INCLUDE FIRST SUPERMARKET IN BOYLE HEIGHTS SINCE THE 1992 RIOTS. 
</P>

<P>
 To the delight of community leaders, one of the oldest Eastside furniture 
stores announced a plan Wednesday to expand its facility into a shopping plaza, 
including a supermarket, drugstore and an auto parts store. 
</P>
<P>
 The 68-year-old Angelus Furniture Warehouse on Olympic Boulevard has entered 
into a partnership with a local development corporation to raise $9.5 million 
to renovate the facility, and bring in Food 4 Less, a Sav-On drugstore and 
Chief Auto Parts, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be really good for the community," said Elsa Lopez, project 
director for Mothers of East Los Angeles, a community organization. "Most 
people go all the way to Monterey Park and Montebello for shopping because the 
prices are a lot higher here. If (the new plaza) can keep the money in the 
community, it would be better. Hopefully other big chains will see that they 
are welcomed here." 
</P>
<P>
 The East Los Angeles Community Union will help fund the project that will 
include the first new supermarket in Boyle Heights since the 1992 riots.  
</P>
<P>
 Irwin Greenberg, who owns Angelus, agrees that the largely Latino neighborhood 
has become a critical consumer base for his business. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with the area is that it hasn't had the right stores to make the 
community feel like they want to shop here," Greenberg said. "But if you offer 
them something they like they stay with you." 
</P>
<P>
 To accommodate the new businesses, Angelus plans to move its furniture store 
to the second floor of the structure at 3650 E. Olympic Blvd. and use the 
ground floor for the new stores. Community union officials said they hope that 
the Angelus Grand Plaza will open next spring and bring about 300 new jobs to 
one of the neglected areas of the city, a community where at least 20% of the 
population lives below the federal poverty line. 
</P>
<P>
 The project's funding sources are two grants, $2.75 million from the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development and $500,000 from the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services.

LITTLE HMOS ARE BIG WINNERS IN CONSUMER STUDY; HEALTH CARE: GIANT COMPANIES 
SUCH AS PACIFICARE AND FHP IN O.C. RECEIVE MIXED REVIEWS IN FIRST COMPREHENSIVE 
SURVEY TO BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC.

 Much like the shopper who prefers the friendliness and convenience of the 
neighborhood grocer to the giant supermarket, many health care consumers 
apparently think smaller is better, according to a survey released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Giant health care companies PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. in Cypress and FHP 
International Corp. in Fountain Valley received mixed reviews in the first 
comprehensive consumer "report card" on California health plans to be made 
available to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey conducted by the Bay Area Business Group on Health, an 
insurance-purchasing coalition of 20 major California employers, involved 
27,000 employees and retirees of 10 large California-based corporations, 
including Chevron Corp., Hughes Aircraft Co. and Rockwell International Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a student's report card, the BBGH survey gave the health plans letter 
grades of A, B or C. No plans received grades of D or F.  
</P>
<P>
 PacifiCare received Cs for service quality, physician services and preventive 
health care screening procedures. It received Bs for overall plan coverage and 
for programs that promote healthy living. 
</P>
<P>
 FHP earned Bs for service quality, plan coverage, physician services and 
counseling programs, and As in two preventive health-care categories measured 
by the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of neither PacifiCare nor FHP could be reached Wednesday to comment 
on the survey results. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey is part of a broader, fast-growing movement among corporate America 
to collect more information about the performance of health care plans so 
consumers can comparison shop for health care as they do for automobiles or 
stereos. 
</P>
<P>
 Many medical specialists view consumer surveys as a useful, if imperfect, way 
of measuring the quality of health insurance plans. Some caution that while 
consumers may be quite capable of evaluating an HMO's customer service 
personnel or doctor's office waiting times, they are not necessarily good 
judges of the quality of medical care they receive from physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Although BBGH has been conducting HMO surveys for five years, it, like many 
large corporations conducting similar surveys, had not previously made results 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 Health Plan of the Redwoods, a mere sapling among California's HMO giants, had 
the most satisfied members, notching straight As in four satisfaction 
categories. Of the 17 HMOs surveyed, it was the only one to receive an A+ in 
any category. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Rosa-based HMO, with just 85,000 members, contracts mostly with 
small employers -- wineries, high-technology firms and the like -- in Sonoma, 
Marin and Mendocino counties, marketing director Chuck Gardner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being smaller places us closer to the patient," he said. "We try to encourage 
our doctors to maintain that one-to-one patient-doctor relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Rodriguez, associate director of BBGH, said smaller regional plans have 
tended to rate higher in previous surveys.  
</P>
<P>
 "On the other hand, some of these smaller plans are more expensive and aren't 
offered by large employers who want a statewide network," she said. She noted, 
however, that the price gap among the HMOs has been narrowing. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiser Permanente, a giant HMO frequently touted as a national model of 
low-cost, quality care, ranked in the middle of the pack for both its Northern 
and Southern California regions. Kaiser, however, got As from its members on 
the quality of its preventive and health improvement programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Joel Hyatt of Kaiser-Southern California said the survey results highlight 
areas that Kaiser recognizes as weaknesses of its vast network. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this heated marketplace, there are things we need to do to improve," he 
said. Hyatt noted that Kaiser was one of several health plans that worked with 
the San Francisco-based business group to develop the survey.  
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the survey found that HMOs excelled in health education and 
preventive health services, such as stop-smoking programs or childhood 
immunization rates. It also found that members of less-restrictive health 
plans, known as preferred-provider organizations, were more satisfied with 
their doctors and the quality of physician specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 BBGH members said they will use the results to evaluate the health plans they 
offer workers; they will also use the data to prod HMOs to improve problem 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, administered by management consultant William M. Mercer, was sent 
to employees and retirees of 10 organizations. Other participants included 
Bechtel, the California Public Employees Retirement System, the Federal Reserve 
Bank of San Francisco, Fireman's Fund, the University of California and Union 
Bank.

INFLATION RATE FOR OCTOBER A SLIGHT 0.1%; ECONOMY: CONSUMER PRICE INDEX REPORT 
PROMPTS CRITICISM -- AND SUPPORT -- OF FED'S LATEST INTEREST RATE HIKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Consumer prices barely budged in October, the Labor Department reported 
Wednesday, offering more proof that inflation remains largely in check despite 
signs of consistently strong economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The consumer price index rose just 0.1% last month, following September's 0.2% 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
 In the greater Los Angeles area, consumer prices rose 0.5% in October but are 
up just 1% for the year through October, the Labor Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Hirabayashi, the Bureau of Labor Statistics regional commissioner in San 
Francisco, attributed last month's increase mainly to higher grocery and 
private transportation costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The report follows by a day the Federal Reserve Board's attempt to ward off 
future inflation with a larger-than-expected boost in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The central bank jacked up key short-term interest rates Tuesday by 
three-quarters of a percentage point -- its sixth increase this year -- in an 
attempt to slow the economy to a less inflationary pace. 
</P>
<P>
 But last month's overall gain in the closely monitored inflation gauge was the 
smallest since prices posted a similar rise in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Fed critics quickly seized on Wednesday's benign inflation report -- energy 
and clothing prices actually fell -- as proof that the central bank had 
needlessly increased the threat of recession by voting the biggest increase in 
interest rates in 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Inflation is not a threat," said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National 
Assn. of Manufacturers and a leading Fed critic. "The Federal Reserve's 
aggressive increase in interest rates yesterday was unnecessary." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics argue that the Fed has failed to realize that dramatic changes in the 
U.S. economy, including increased foreign competition, mean the economy can 
grow at faster rates with lower unemployment without raising inflation threats. 
</P>
<P>
 But other economists support the central bank, saying that at this stage of 
the recovery, with U.S. industry operating at a 15-year high and unemployment 
down to 5.8%, there is a need to slow growth to keep inflation from getting out 
of control next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Many economists insisted that the Fed's efforts to achieve a "soft landing" -- 
growth slow enough to keep wage and price pressures under control -- appear to 
be working. 
</P>
<P>
 A drop of 0.7% in October energy prices helped hold down the overall consumer 
price index. Food prices, which remained unchanged, also tempered the general 
advance. In September, energy prices also fell 0.7%, while food prices rose 
0.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 But even without the impact of the often-volatile food and energy segments, 
the so-called core rate of inflation showed an increase of only 0.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 The CPI figures show inflation rising at a pace that was slightly slower than 
forecast. Economists on average had predicted that consumer prices would rise 
0.2%. Excluding food and energy, they expected prices to rise 0.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Other data released by the government suggests that the economy could 
strengthen further. 
</P>
<P>
 American workers' average weekly paychecks jumped in October, the biggest 
monthly increase in more than a decade. Average weekly earnings rose 1.5% last 
month, the largest advance since a 2.3% gain in February, 1982, the Labor 
Department said. Earnings rose 0.7% in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Because consumers account for about two-thirds of the nation's economic 
activity, the buying power of the average worker is viewed as key to future 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
 In another report, the Commerce Department said inventories held by American 
businesses rose in September for a sixth straight month as businesses kept 
building stocks before the coming holiday sales season. 
</P>
<P>
 Total business inventories increased 0.5% to a seasonally adjusted $907.2 
billion -- well above Wall Street economists' expectations of a slim 0.1% rise 
-- following a 0.9% gain in August. Consumer Price Index

CREDIT BY TRIAL AND ERROR; A MOUNTAIN OF BAD DEBT MENACES MEXICO'S SHIFT TO A 
FREE-MARKET ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rosa Maria Mendez understands far more about the bad-loan portfolio of Mexican 
banks than she ever wanted to. The 39-year-old housewife and former secretary 
is, reluctantly, part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 She has not made a mortgage payment on her two-bedroom condominium in the 
three years she has lived in a housing project on the outskirts of this beach 
resort. Mendez and the other 360 families in the complex are refusing to pay 
until their homes are completed correctly by a problematic contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the human face of a worsening crisis in Mexico's fast-expanding 
banking industry. Even as the banks brace for the foreign competition to come 
with the lowering of trade barriers, they have seen their proportion of bad 
loans mount to as much as 14% nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The surge in sour loans threatens the stability of the recently privatized 
banking system and could trigger a wave of insolvency comparable to the savings 
and loan crisis in the United States in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendez and her taxi driver husband wistfully recall the handsome scale model 
that prompted them to scrape up $30,000 for their down payment in 1991. "It was 
so beautiful, with open areas and even hanging gardens," she said during a 
recent interview in her modest, tile-floored living room. "Why, you would have 
thought we were going to be living in the hotel zone!" 
</P>
<P>
 The reality of three-story concrete buildings with three condominiums to a 
floor has been quite different. Weeds grow between the buildings and mud 
puddles fill the unpaved streets and parking lots. Water pipes and drainage are 
shared among nine neighbors; if someone leaves a water heater lit, everyone's 
water heats to boiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendez and her neighbors are unhappy with their houses. The builder is on the 
brink of bankruptcy and the bank is stuck with bad loans. So it goes as Mexico 
is dragged and prodded toward a free-market economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The principles in the Mendezes' troubled housing venture are caught in a web 
of good intentions gone awry: bank efforts to provide badly needed consumer 
credit, government attempts to deliver on promises of housing for low-income 
workers, a builder's eagerness to make a place for himself in the country's new 
entrepreneurial environment and public pressure to do it all quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, nobody was ready. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem, says Roberto Hernandez, chairman of the Mexican Bankers 
Assn., is the economic downturn that has cost many borrowers their jobs. But 
the backdrop, he says, is Mexico's lack of a "credit culture." The need to 
maintain a good credit rating is a new concept to most borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, government-owned banks -- the only kind Mexico had until 
privatization began in 1991 -- did not have senior credit officers or even 
acknowledge the need for a person who could independently judge whether to 
grant a loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad loans were often simply forgiven. Mortgages for low-income families were 
almost sure to be losses: Decades of high inflation had resulted in high 
interest rates, so a worker's monthly mortgage payment often did not even cover 
the interest, much less touch the principal. At the end of the loan term, 
people faced huge balloon payments, and banks routinely wrote them off. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government did not seriously try to collect," said Jose Burillo, 
executive director of the Southeastern Region for Grupo Financiera Serfin, a 
major financial holding company. "When we took over (from the government), we 
could not even send people their statements. Those who wanted to pay, paid. 
Those who did not, did not." 
</P>
<P>
 That atmosphere set the stage, and conflicting pressures unleashed by the 
free-market reforms of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari created the problems 
Mendez and her neighbors are confronting today. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, the Gulf Coast city of Cancun faced a serious housing shortage 
caused by the success of the government's subsidizing investment in tourism, a 
key component of a strategy to attract foreign money. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of high-rise hotels sprang up on the beach, and Mexicans poured in from 
across the country to make the hotel beds, carry the guests' suitcases, drive 
taxis and wait tables. Unable to find housing, they lived in shacks in a nearby 
swamp -- bad for the environment and disastrous for Cancun's image as a 
world-class resort. 
</P>
<P>
 That put Cancun near the head of the list of places in need of low-income 
housing projects, which the government turned over to banks and private 
developers. The banks, still government-owned, were under pressure to lend 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Banca Serfin, Mexico's third-largest bank, granted Perisur Crepusculo, a 
company owned by builder Angel Fernandez, a bridge loan to finance the project 
where Mendez lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Eager buyers moved in before the project was finished, but banker Burillo says 
Fernandez overextended himself. Work stopped six months ago, and he hasn't made 
a payment on his bridge loan in a year, the bank says. 
</P>
<P>
 The contractor, unavailable for comment, is negotiating with Serfin. 
Meanwhile, the bank is restructuring the mortgages. The bank has offered to 
stretch out the original 20-year loans to 30 years. Some owners assume their 
loans will be written off, as usual. For her part, Mendez is wary of the offer, 
which doesn't stipulate the interest rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not going to let them trick us again," she said. Bad Loans Rising 
</P>
<P>
 Non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans granted by Mexican banks, 
by quarter: 
</P>
<P>
 2nd quarter, 1994: 8.31%

ASIA-PACIFIC PACT EXPECTED TO GIVE STATE'S EXPORTERS A WELCOME BOOST; TRADE: 
CALIFORNIA EXECUTIVES AND ECONOMISTS ALSO VIEW THE 18-NATION APEC ACCORD AS A 
BOON FOR CONSUMERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The beneficiaries range from Stac Electronics, a San Diego maker of 
data-compression software, to Harris Ranch Beef Co. in Selma. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, just about every California company that exports goods and services 
to the Pacific Rim stands to benefit from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
trade agreement signed Tuesday in Indonesia by the United States and 17 other 
Pacific Rim nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the signatory countries to APEC, as the agreement is called, have more 
restrictive trade policies than the United States. Thus lower tariffs will help 
U.S. exports the most. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more important, California executives and economists expect that by 
stimulating trade, the pact will ultimately raise Pacific Rim nations' income 
levels and spending power, which in turn will create more demand for California 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
 "For Stac, it means computer infrastructure will grow in developing countries, 
and that will result in more investment and growth in software in general," 
said John Witzel, vice president of finance at Stac Electronics, a maker of 
software that enables personal computer users to cram more data onto hard 
disks. 
</P>
<P>
 California consumers should also benefit. Asian-made textiles, apparel, 
sporting goods and machine tools will be cheaper as the United States eases 
tariffs on those items to hold up its end of the bargain. The APEC accord could 
set up the world's single-largest trade zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement will also help open up China's market, the world's largest in 
terms of sheer population and one that California producers, compared to those 
in other states, would have a leg up on by virtue of geographic proximity. 
Until now, the Chinese have been much more receptive to foreign plants and 
capital than they have been to imported consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no presence in China right now. That's a huge market," Witzel said. 
</P>
<P>
 But observers cautioned that it may take years for California companies and 
consumers to feel the positive effects: Tariffs are to be eliminated over 25 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The major signatories include the United States, Japan, Australia, South 
Korea, New Zealand, China and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris Ranch Vice President John Isadore said some Pacific Rim economies, even 
potential powerhouse China, still have some growing up to do before markets 
will develop for some U.S. commodities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mainland China's economy can't afford our (beef) products," he said. "As of 
now, the only business we're doing there is to hotels and restaurants that 
cater to foreigners." 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics such as UC San Diego economics professor Stephan Haggard also 
wondered whether the final agreement would effectively deal with non-tariff 
barriers and powerful political interests in countries such as Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the reservations, most economists and industry officials hailed the 
agreement as a positive step toward global free trade and one sure to benefit 
California over the long haul. The state already enjoys massive trade 
throughout the Pacific Rim, exporting about $56 billion in goods and services a 
year to the trade zone, including Canada and Mexico. That amounts to 80% of the 
state's $69 billion in total exports. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without the agreement, California companies have a disproportionate 25% 
share of total U.S. exports to Pacific Rim countries, compared to 15% of the 
nation's overall exports, according to the California Trade and Commerce 
Agency. California's largest exports are machinery and computers, electronic 
components, transportation products (including aircraft), scientific 
instruments and agriculture products. 
</P>
<P>
 California's exports would rise even higher once all Pacific Rim countries 
even their playing fields, said Haggard, an economist specializing in trade 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, every company that exports to the region is likely to gain from 
this," Haggard said. 
</P>
<P>
 The elimination of tariffs will especially help California manufacturers and 
service providers involved in high technology, software, medical equipment, 
telecommunications and auto parts, said Michael Liikala, regional director for 
international trade at the Commerce Department's San Francisco office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Pacific Rim is the fastest-growing market and population base in the 
world," said Bill Krist, a spokesman for the American Electronics Assn., a 
high-technology trade group. "The doing away with tariff barriers is going to 
help our companies compete better." 
</P>
<P>
 But the most significant trade opportunities may be for California agriculture 
interests. China, for example, in effect bans imports of citrus, table grapes 
and cherries, all big California crops. And Taiwan now imposes very high 
tariffs, often 40% or more, on fruits, vegetables and beef, according to Anne 
Chadwick, trade policy adviser to the California Department of Food and 
Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 "My impression is that anything that will liberalize our access to Asian 
markets, particularly to Southeast Asia and China, will help California 
growers," Chadwick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Goold, executive vice president of the Western United Dairymen, a 
Modesto-based trade organization of 1,400 California dairy producers, said his 
members currently export only about 2% of their annual production totaling $2.5 
billion, a percentage that is sure to grow if APEC is effective. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Rim "market is not very good right now, but it's a potential 
sleeping giant for us," Goold said.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: WHY HIGH TECH WILL BECOME A BATTLEGROUND IN 
WASHINGTON

 Right up until a week ago Tuesday, Arati Prabhakar was a supersmart 
35-year-old technocrat running the fastest-growing agency in the Clinton 
Administration. Come next year, Prabhakar will still be a supersmart Clinton 
Administration technocrat. Her agency, however, won't be growing quite so fast. 
In fact, she will be lucky if the new Republican Congress doesn't cut it to 
ribbons. 
</P>
<P>
 Prabhakar directs the National Institute of Standards and Technology -- the 
centerpiece of this Administration's efforts to boost America's high-tech 
competitiveness. Once an obscure backwater agency in the Commerce Department, 
NIST has become the Administration's innovation agency: Its annual budget has 
soared from $383 million in the 1993 fiscal year to $854 million two years 
later, and was set to top $1.4 billion by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 NIST now does everything from administering the Baldrige quality awards to 
overseeing manufacturing extension programs to co-investing with industry in 
the high-risk, high-reward projects funded by the Advanced Technology Programs. 
In other words, NIST offers a perfect microcosm of the Administration's 
ambitions to create a new generation of public-private partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my mind," says Prabhakar, "the bottom line of what this is all about is to 
try to get government and industry to work together to do the jobs that can't 
be done separately. . . . You have to believe that government can do positive 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 As the first woman to win a Caltech Ph.D in applied physics and a veteran of 
the Pentagon's Advanced Research Projects Agency -- long a high-tech hotbed -- 
Prabhakar was impeccably qualified to transform what was once the National 
Bureau of Standards into an aggressive promoter of innovation investment. 
Politically suitable and technically superb, Prabhakar represents both the 
symbol and substance of what the Clinton Administration is trying to do in 
high-tech competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, she is also the symbol and substance of what the New Republican 
Majority fundamentally opposes: a technocrat who wants to pick winners and 
losers in emerging high-tech markets; chief of a bureaucracy that uses taxpayer 
dollars to subsidize risky ventures by private enterprise; a strong believer in 
the notion that government participation in the marketplace is more of a help 
than a hindrance to entrepreneurs who want to transform academic ideas into 
economic realities. 
</P>
<P>
 The essential conflict here is not one between better government leadership or 
more effective allocation of funds; it's about more government involvement 
versus less government involvement. Ideology -- not competence -- is the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 While federal funding for basic science and national security technology 
enjoys bipartisan support, "there is not yet a full consensus on an additional 
mission for federal R&D to promote economic growth," Prabhakar concedes. 
</P>
<P>
 However, she sees a NIST-like role as economically inevitable. "This kind of a 
strategic shift is mandatory over the long term," she says. "It will either 
happen now or it will happen later. . . . That timing will largely be a 
perception of industry and what value does industry see in partnering with 
government." 
</P>
<P>
 Without question, the most controversial piece of NIST's portfolio is the 
Advanced Technology Program, which Prabhakar describes as "cost-shared funding 
to individual companies and industry-led joint ventures to develop the 
high-risk, high-payoff technologies that can enable significant commercial 
progress." Those areas include rapid response manufacturing, thermoplastics, 
machine tools and auto body construction. All kinds of companies -- from small 
entrepreneurial firms to industry giants such as General Motors, Ford, Texas 
Instruments and General Electric -- now receive ATP funding from NIST. Isn't 
this funding -- which runs into the hundreds of millions -- simply a direct 
subsidy to commercial industry? 
</P>
<P>
 "Industry is precisely the place in the economy where we wish to deliver value 
with our programs," Prabhakar responds. "I'm not embarrassed about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Prabhakar asserts that NIST programs "are delivering value and that 
moots a lot of the basis for the theological discussions. . . . The theology is 
that it's bad for government and industry to be working together. I haven't 
heard any arguments that are much deeper than that." 
</P>
<P>
 She adds that NIST's proposed 1997 budget would amount to only 2% of total 
federal research and development spending, and she describes her agency as "a 
2% experiment to see if we can do things that tackle those jobs that require 
government and industry to work together. . . . This is all about risk. Our 
program would be an utter failure if everything we did was a glorious success." 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, Prabhakar notes, "my greatest dream for an ATP manager is for that 
person to become a noted leader in his or her field by creating a vision by 
working with the industry -- not dictating to it -- to facilitate investment 
and innovation." 
</P>
<P>
 In many respects, what Prabhakar is describing is a civilian notion of the 
Advanced Research Projects Agency, where she once worked. Just as ARPA helped 
the national security infrastructure develop a culture of rapid innovation, 
says Prabhakar, NIST needs to help foster a comparable culture of innovation in 
the civilian domain. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's precisely why NIST is destined to be a political battleground 
between the Administration and Congress: Does Washington best create an 
innovation culture by encouraging more and better public-private partnerships? 
Or does industrial innovation flow more readily when government supports only 
basic science and technology -- and then gets out of the way?  
</P>
<P>
 NIST is going to be the medium through which America's innovation policy is 
determined.

LITTLE HMOS WIN BIG IN CONSUMER SURVEY; HEALTH CARE: SMALLER PLANS IN 
CALIFORNIA COME OUT ON TOP IN FIRST COMPREHENSIVE STUDY TO BE MADE PUBLIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Much like the shopper who prefers the friendliness and convenience of the 
neighborhood grocer to the giant supermarket, many health care consumers 
apparently think smaller is better, according to a survey released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Small health maintenance organizations such as little-known Health Plan of the 
Redwoods got higher marks than larger, better-known rivals such as Kaiser 
Permanente and PacifiCare Health Systems in the first comprehensive consumer 
"report card" of California health plans to be made available to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey conducted by the Bay Area Business Group on Health, an 
insurance-purchasing coalition of 20 major California employers, involved 
27,000 employees and retirees of 10 large California-based corporations, 
including Chevron Corp., Hughes Aircraft Co. and Rockwell International Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey is part of a broader, fast-growing movement among corporate America 
to collect more information about the performance of health care plans so 
consumers can comparison-shop for health care as they do for automobiles or 
stereos. 
</P>
<P>
 Many medical specialists view consumer surveys as a useful, if imperfect, way 
of measuring the quality of health insurance plans. Some caution that while 
consumers may be quite capable of evaluating an HMO's customer service 
personnel or doctor's office waiting times, they are not necessarily good 
judges of the quality of medical care they receive from physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Although BBGH has been conducting HMO surveys for five years, it, like many 
large corporations conducting similar surveys, had not previously made results 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a student's report card, the BBGH survey gave the health plans letter 
grades of A, B or C. Unlike a student's report card, C was the lowest grade 
possible; the group chose not to give out Ds and Fs. 
</P>
<P>
 Health Plan of the Redwoods, a mere sapling among California's HMO giants, had 
the most satisfied members, notching straight A's in four satisfaction 
categories. Of the 17 HMOs surveyed, it was the only one to receive an A+ in 
any category. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Rosa-based HMO, with just 85,000 members, contracts mostly with 
small employers -- wineries, high-technology firms and the like -- in Sonoma, 
Marin and Mendocino counties, marketing director Chuck Gardner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being smaller places us closer to the patient," he said. "We try to encourage 
our doctors to maintain that one-to-one patient-doctor relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Rodriguez, associate director of BBGH, said smaller regional plans have 
tended to rate higher in previous surveys.  
</P>
<P>
 "On the other hand, some of these smaller plans are more expensive and aren't 
offered by large employers who want a statewide network," she said. She noted, 
however, that the price gap among the HMOs has been narrowing. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiser Permanente, a giant HMO frequently touted as a national model of 
low-cost, quality care, ranked in the middle of the pack for both its Northern 
and Southern California regions. Kaiser, however, got A's from its members on 
the quality of its preventive and health improvement programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Joel Hyatt of Kaiser-Southern California said the survey results highlight 
areas that Kaiser recognizes as weaknesses of its vast network. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this heated marketplace, there are things we need to do to improve," he 
said. Hyatt noted that Kaiser was one of several health plans that worked with 
the San Francisco-based business group to develop the survey.  
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the survey found that HMOs excelled in health education and 
preventive health services, such as stop-smoking programs or childhood 
immunization rates. It also found that members of less-restrictive health 
plans, known as preferred-provider organizations, were more satisfied with 
their doctors and the quality of physician specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 BBGH members said they will use the results to evaluate the health plans they 
offer workers; they will also use the data to prod HMOs to improve problem 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, administered by management consultant William M. Mercer, was sent 
to employees and retirees of 10 organizations. Other participants included 
Bechtel, the California Public Employees Retirement System, the Federal Reserve 
Bank of San Francisco, Fireman's Fund, the University of California and Union 
Bank. Grading the HMOs 
</P>
<P>
 The Bay Area Business Group on Health, a private insurance purchasing 
coalition, surveyed 27,000 employees and retirees of 10 major California 
employers to measure their satisfaction with their health plans. The rankings 
listed below grade the health plans in four categories: an overall grade for 
the plan, the doctor that members see most frequently -- usually a primary care 
physician, hospital care and the plan's preventive care services, such as 
smoking cessation or injury prevention programs. 05,17,12,08,10,12 Hospital 
Preventive HMO Plan grade Doctor care health Aetna HMO C B A B Blue Shield B B 
C B Cigna B B B B California Care B B C- C FHP C B B B Foundation B A B B HP of 
Redwoods A+ A A A Health Net B B B B Kaiser North B C C A Kaiser South B C B A 
Lifeguard A A A C Maxicare C C C B Omni A B B C PacifiCare C C B B QualMed B B 
A C TakeCare B B B B ValueCare A A B A  
</P>
<P>
 Explaining the grades: According to the Bay Area Business Group on Health, 
HMOs that scored in the top 25th percentile received an A. Those scoring in the 
lowest 25th percentile got a B. Unusually high scores merited an A+, and 
unusualy low scores were given a C-.

 Morgan Stanley 3rd-Quarter Profit Drops 35%: The parent of Morgan Stanley & 
Co., the fourth-largest securities firm, reported it earned $118 million, or 
$1.30 per share, in the three months ended Oct. 31.That was down from $182 
million, or $2.20 per share, in last year's third quarter. Revenue fell 12%, to 
$910 million from $1.03 billion. Morgan Stanley Group Inc. shares closed down 
$1 at $61.875 on the NYSE. Morgan Stanley was hurt by lower revenue from 
underwriting stocks and bonds for companies and reduced trading volume by 
investors in the bond market.

United Airlines' new Shuttle: $9.97 to fly between Southern California and the 
Bay Area.The promotional fare, designed to increase awareness of the new 
service and an electronic ticketing system, is available on a limited number of 
seats on 300 flights, the airline said. It is only good from noon on 
Thanksgiving Day until noon Saturday. By Wednesday afternoon, about 3,000 of 
the 5,600 available seats were already taken, according to United spokesman Joe 
Hopkins. All the revenue goes to charity, he said.

THRIFT FRAUD WEIGHED ON SCALES OF JUSTICE; CRIME: ALL BUT 4% OF S & L CONVICTS 
GOT LESS THAN 10 YEARS. STUDY SHOWS THE AVERAGE BURGLAR DOES MORE TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Criminals convicted of defrauding the nation's savings and loans receive 
prison terms far shorter than those imposed on the average burglar, according 
to a UC Irvine report released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, titled "Fraud in the Savings and Loan Industry: White-Collar Crime 
and Government Response," found that 78% of 580 thrift fraud convicts were sent 
to prison, but only 4% of them got terms of 10 years or longer and just 13% 
were sentenced to at least five years behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 The median sentence was less than two years, according to the $240,000 study, 
sponsored by the Justice Department's National Institute of Justice and 
directed by Henry N. Pontell, a criminology professor at University of 
California, Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, for example, the average prison term given those convicted of major 
thrift crime was 36.4 months, while the average burglar got 55.6 months in 
prison and the average car thief was sentenced to 38 months, Pontell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The thrift cases that year accounted for losses of more than $8 billion, but 
judges meted out fines and restitution orders totaling less than $348 million 
and only a fraction of that amount was collected, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 While sentences for S&L defrauders have been light in general, those convicted 
in serious cases involving major losses generally received much tougher 
sentences, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Lincoln Savings & Loan case, the most notorious failure, thrift 
operator Charles H. Keating Jr. was sentenced to 10 years in prison for state 
securities fraud and to 12 years, seven months on his federal racketeering, 
conspiracy and fraud convictions. He is appealing his federal conviction from 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 In the study, Pontell and his colleagues also dissected so-called criminal 
referrals, regulators' requests for FBI investigations into suspected criminal 
activities mainly involving thrift insiders. They counted and matched names in 
the referrals, for instance, to see whose names came up repeatedly and what 
happened to them. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, they determined, that just one in four people "referred" by 
regulators for criminal investigation was prosecuted. In Texas, where most 
referrals were made, one in seven was prosecuted.

 Rockwell Alters Reliance Electric Bid: The Seal Beach-based aerospace and 
industrial concern, looking to strike a friendly merger with Reliance, said it 
removed most of the conditions attached to its $1.5-billion offer, provided 
Reliance removes its anti-takeover "poison pill" defenses.Rockwell said the few 
remaining conditions would include that at least a majority of Reliance's stock 
be tendered to the company. Rockwell also said that if no agreement is reached, 
it will pursue its cash tender offer of $30 a share. Reliance, which has been 
neutral toward Rockwell's bid, earlier agreed to be acquired by General Signal.

ENTERTAINMENT; QWEST TO REFLECT DIVERSITY OF ITS TV VIEWERS, PARTNERS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Entertainment executive Quincy Jones, chairman of a newly formed venture that 
could become the largest minority-controlled broadcasting company in the 
country, said Wednesday that he and his partners are committed to providing 
programming and station management that reflects the diversity of the 
communities they serve. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, former pro football player Willie D. Davis, TV host Geraldo Rivera and 
"Soul Train" producer Don Cornelius announced Wednesday that they are forming a 
joint venture with Tribune Broadcasting to purchase TV stations around the 
country. The new company, Qwest Broadcasting, has agreed to purchase WATL in 
Atlanta for approximately $150 million and WNOL in New Orleans for 
approximately $17 million. Jones said that Qwest, which will be based in Los 
Angeles, plans to buy 12 TV stations over the next three to five years as part 
of the venture, which he confirmed eventually could invest up to $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The four partners will control 55% of the new company. Tribune Broadcasting 
will have a 45% stake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have ultimate control over the programming, personnel and finance for 
the stations we buy," said Jones, who will own a majority interest in the 
stations with his partners. "We are business executives (first), but I believe 
we have an opportunity to create an alternative to what is currently on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who currently owns WNOL in partnership with Time Warner, said the Qwest 
stations will do local programming that "might serve as a laboratory" for shows 
that could be syndicated nationally. WNOL currently sponsors several 
community-outreach programs and airs public-service spots highlighting the 
achievements of local youngsters. Although WNOL and WATL do not have local news 
operations, Jones said Qwest plans to make news an important part of these 
operations and others that Qwest purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult to say how dramatic a difference minority ownership will make 
because we're in virgin territory with this," Rivera said. "But I believe that 
the diversity of our own experience as successful business executives is bound 
to be reflected in our TV stations."

TIMES GAINS IN ORANGE COUNTY, VALLEY; TOTAL CIRCULATION DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Times continues to post circulation gains in its key 
competitive markets -- Orange County and the San Fernando Valley -- though 
total circulation has declined slightly, according to figures released 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Total daily circulation for The Times -- the nation's second-largest 
metropolitan daily -- declined by 27,488 copies, or 2.5%, to 1,062,202 for the 
six months ended Sept. 30, according to figures filed with the Audit Bureau of 
Circulations. Sunday circulation was down 30,559 copies, or 2.1%, to 1,457,925. 
</P>
<P>
 Daily circulation in Orange County reached 198,969, up 742 copies, or 0.4%, 
from the same period a year earlier. Sunday circulation there rose by 6,901 
copies, or 2.4%, to 294,903. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley and Ventura County, daily circulation rose 1,053 
copies, or 0.5%, to 230,305. Sunday circulation fell 2,013 copies, or 0.6%, to 
335,426. 
</P>
<P>
 The decreases in overall circulation are the result of lingering effects of 
the recession on street sales, January's Northridge earthquake and planned 
circulation cutbacks outside the newspaper's primary markets, the newspaper 
said.

ENTERTAINMENT; SAVOY ANNOUNCES RESTRUCTURING, REPLACES FILM CHIEF GREISMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Savoy Pictures Entertainment, plagued by such box-office duds as "Exit to 
Eden" and "Serial Mom," on Wednesday disclosed a financial restructuring to 
boost its capital base and named producer Rob Fried to replace Alan Greisman as 
president of its motion picture unit. 
</P>
<P>
 The independent movie company is cutting its debt burden by allowing four 
institutional investors to swap $40 million in bonds for common stock at $10 a 
share, lower than the $18.60 original conversion price. 
</P>
<P>
 Holders of some $65 million in bonds will be offered the same deal. Savoy also 
expects to boost its capital base with $500 million from Chemical Bank, $200 
million in the form of a revolving credit facility and $300 million for a 
television station venture it has with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Since debuting with "A Bronx Tale" in September, 1993, Savoy has released a 
batch of films that have often received good reviews -- such as "Shadowlands" 
and "Serial Mom" -- but which failed to catch fire at the box office. The 
company lost $15.1 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30 and $28.9 million in 
the first nine months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the company's stock has plunged. It closed at $7.25 a share on 
Wednesday in over-the-counter trading, down 62.5 cents. Earlier this year, it 
traded at about $21. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, President Lewis J. Korman said the lower debt load and 
infusion of funds will allow the company to expand into such areas as 
television programming as well as be more competitive in buying film projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Greisman will become a consultant and in-house producer, Korman said. Korman 
said that Fried will be allowed to remain involved in TriStar's remake of 
"Godzilla."

 Council Lists 1994 'Worst U.S. Corporate Polluters': In the latest of its 
annual evaluations, the Council on Economic Priorities, a New York-based 
environmental research group, gives black marks to Union Carbide Corp., Exxon 
Corp., International Paper Co., Southern Co., Texaco Inc., Westinghouse 
Electric Co., Westvaco and Maxxam Inc., based on evaluations by an independent 
panel of judges who reviewed more than 100 U.S. corporations. Corporations 
including Rockwell International Corp., DuPont Co. and Louisiana Pacific Corp. 
were deemed to have made environmental progress and were dropped from the 1994 
list. Texaco disagreed "strongly" with its inclusion on the list.

 FTC Files Cyberspace Ad Complaint: Federal consumer protection authorities 
blazed a trail onto the information superhighway with the Federal Trade 
Commission for the first time targeting deceptive advertising on a computer 
network.The agency said it reached a settlement with a California man accused 
of posting messages on America Online's computer service that offered 
misleading promises to help financially troubled consumers create new credit 
histories. "We want to make it clear that advertising on the information 
superhighway is going to be held to the same standards as advertising in other 
media," FTC Chairman Janet D. Steiger said. "If it's unfair or deceptive in a 
magazine or newspaper, it's unfair or deceptive in cyberspace."

FINANCIAL MARKETS; BOND RATES RISE AGAIN; STOCKS END MIXED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Long-term bond yields resumed their advance Wednesday, brushing off reassuring 
inflation data and the Federal Reserve Board's latest effort to slow the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, stocks closed mixed, with financial issues under new pressure 
from rising interest rates. The dollar, meanwhile, was clipped by profit 
taking. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the day had promised to go well, traders said. On Tuesday 
the Fed raised short-term interest rates for the sixth time this year in a 
further attempt to slow the economy and hold down inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the government's report Wednesday on October consumer inflation 
was favorable: Prices rose just 0.1% in the month, smallest in six months. Many 
analysts had expected a 0.2% rise, matching September. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields initially dropped after the inflation report. But sellers took 
control as the day wore on. 
</P>
<P>
 By the close the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, which had eased from 
8.07% on Monday to 8.03% Tuesday, jumped back to 8.09%, hovering just under the 
three-year high of 8.16% reached on Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 With the latest economic reports pointing to continued strength, many bond 
players simply don't believe that interest rates have yet peaked. As for the 
low October inflation figure, "Inflation is a lagging indicator," said Marcello 
Frustaci, a trader at Daiwa Securities America. "The economy is a lot stronger 
than the inflation numbers tell you it is." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's symptomatic of the same bearish trend" for bonds that has prevailed all 
year, said Kim Rupert, economist at MMS International in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, the Dow industrials closed with a gain of 18.84 points to 
3,845.20, helped by big jumps in two stocks. But the broad market didn't follow 
the Dow. Losers topped winners by 12 to 10 on the NYSE, and broader market 
indexes closed mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 173 stocks hit new 52-week lows on the NYSE, while only 31 hit new 
highs. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders noted that many investors can't develop any conviction about stocks, 
despite recently strong corporate earnings, because interest rates continue to 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last time rates were up here, the Dow was at 2,900," said Louis Todd, 
trader at J.C. Bradford & Co. "The market's high in terms of where rates are." 
</P>
<P>
 Also weighing on stocks and bonds Wednesday was a reversal in the dollar, 
which had been rebounding. In New York the dollar closed at 1.551 German marks 
and 98.35 Japanese yen, down from 1.556 and 98.76 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Wednesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Financial stocks were broadly lower, reacting to the latest rise in interest 
rates. Higher rates can squeeze profits of banks and insurers. Among the day's 
losers, Citicorp fell 3/4 to 45 1/8, Wells Fargo sank 2 to 144 3/8, Banc One 
lost 5/8 to 26 3/8 and Mellon dropped 1 to 34 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. Trust jumped 3 1/8 to 64 5/8. It said it is in talks to sell its 
securities-processing business. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Dow was pumped up as Boeing surged 1 3/8 to 45 1/8. The Wall Street 
Journal reported that major aircraft leasing firms are close to signing new 
orders with Boeing and with rival McDonnell Douglas, which rose 2 3/4 to 142 
1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Also within the Dow, Kodak rose 2 to 49 3/8 in the wake of new cost-cutting 
moves. 
</P>
<P>
 * Takeover deals and rumors moved several stocks. National Gypsum soared 12 
1/16 to 44 13/16 after investment firm Delcor Inc. made a $940 million bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Renewed takeover or restructuring talk also lifted HMO Wellpoint Health 2 3/8 
to 29 5/8, gaming firm Caesars World 1 3/8 to 42 1/8 and cable TV giant 
Tele-Communications 3/4 to 23 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among new issues, PIMCO Advisors, parent of Newport Beach-based money 
manager Pacific Investment Management, sold 4.6 million units at 18 1/8 each. 
The stock closed at 17 3/4 on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign markets, a last-minute rally boosted Mexico City's Bolsa index 
51.26 points to 2,510.41. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Tokyo the 225-share Nikkei index resumed its fall, dropping 85.02 
points to 19,306.66. In London the FTSE 100 index rose 11.1 points to 3,146.5. 
German markets were closed for a holiday.

SPOKESPERSON GOT YOU NERVOUS? THERE'S HELP 
</P>

<P>
 "Death before dishonor!" goes the ancient battle cry. 
</P>
<P>
 But where a company's celebrity spokesperson is concerned, either result is to 
be feared. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why a unit of American International Group Inc. has begun offering 
"Death, Disablement and Disgrace" insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The policies -- with coverage limits up to $5 million -- protect corporations 
"against losses associated with the cancellation of celebrity promotions or 
endorsements due to events that are beyond the insured's control," Robert R. 
Brace, president of AIG's American International Entertainment subsidiary, said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance compensates companies for the loss of irrecoverable production 
costs or the expense of revising a promotional campaign for the same product. 
</P>
<P>
 AI Entertainment has long been writing entertainment performance coverage -- 
insuring that the Rolling Stones will show up for a concert, for example -- and 
Brace described the new product as "an extension of what we've done." 
</P>
<P>
 "Heightened scrutiny by the media has increased the need for this type of 
coverage," he added, though he declined to cite specific cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Some obvious examples leap to mind, however. O.J. Simpson was a spokesman for 
Hertz before he became a murder defendant. Actor James Garner promoted the beef 
industry before encountering well-publicized heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides using medical tests and other documentation to help gauge the risk 
posed by a particular spokesperson, the insurers might also take into account a 
celebrity's media image, Brace said.

EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; MILES, POINTS AND UPGRADES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frequent Flyer magazine sorted out the new frequent-traveler promotions in its 
November issue, picking out what it considered the best. Here's an excerpt from 
its suggestions for the best ways to beef up your mileage accounts: Airlines 
</P>
<P>
 United Shuttle Offer: United Airlines launched its West Coast Shuttle by 
United in October with a special offer for passengers: MileagePlus members who 
take eight Shuttle round trips in 12 months can earn a Shuttle Saver award 
flight for just 6,000 miles. Program members earn 500 miles per trip through 
February, then actual miles beginning in March. 
</P>
<P>
 AA Miles Buy Hotel Nights: Now through March 31, members of American's 
AAdvantage program can trade miles for hotel stays with partner chains. The 
price for one free night ranges from 10,000 miles at selected Forte, Hilton, 
Hilton International and Wyndham hotels to 15,000 at Inter-Continental and 
Marriott hotels to 20,000 at two Wyndham resorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Air France Introduces Frequence Plus: The program lets travelers earn miles 
not only on Air France flights, but also on the French domestic carrier Air 
Inter, Avis and Hertz car rentals and Meridien hotel stays. Through Dec. 31, 
new U.S. members earn a 5,000-mile bonus for signing up and another 5,000 miles 
for their first transatlantic flight on Air France after joining. Business 
class earns a double-mileage premium, and first class and Concorde award 2 1/2 
times the mileage flown. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta Rewards Avis Renters: Through December, Delta program members who rent 
Avis cars in conjunction with their flights will earn the usual 1,000 miles per 
rental, but with each fourth rental they'll get a 5,000-mile bonus. Delta has 
also added Hertz as a partner. 
</P>
<P>
 New Telephone Connections: This past summer, America West Airlines started a 
tie-in with Sprint, the long-distance phone company, awarding five miles for 
each dollar spent. Continental Airlines connected with MCI in October, its 
first affiliation with a long-distance telephone carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 British Airways, USAir Allow Mileage Swaps: British Airways has extended 
through Dec. 31, 1995, mileage transfer rights for members of its and USAir's 
programs, permitting them to switch up to 100,000 miles from one account to the 
other. In addition, Gold Tier members of British Airways' Executive Club 
program now earn a 100% mileage bonus on all USAir and British Airways flights 
-- up from 25%. British Airways fliers can also collect mileage on Qantas. Car 
Rentals 
</P>
<P>
 Double Mileage on Avis and Hertz: As part of its recent partnership 
affiliation with United's MileagePlus program, Avis will allow program members 
to earn 1,000 miles for each rental through the end of November -- up from 500 
miles. Through Jan. 31, 1995, Hertz is offering leisure renters double airline 
mileage -- 1,000 miles per rental -- to frequent-flier members of Alaska 
Airlines, Northwest, United and USAir. 
</P>
<P>
 Free Flights and Rental Discounts: Now through Dec. 15, five Budget rentals at 
any U.S. or Canadian location will earn a free round-trip ticket on American 
Airlines, provided the rentals are for compact or larger vehicles and payment 
is made with an American Express card. Hotels 
</P>
<P>
 Hilton Sweetens HHonors: While already allowing members to "double dip" -- 
collect both hotel points and airline miles -- Hilton now lets them exchange 
HHonors points for miles and vice versa. The minimum miles-to-points swap is 
5,000 air miles for 10,000 HHonors points. A reverse swap, on the other hand, 
converts a minimum of 10,000 HHonors points to 1,500 air miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Westin Revives Triple Miles: Any Westin guest who logs at least two hotel 
stays between Oct. 1, 1994, and March 31, 1995, and pays with an American 
Express card can earn 1,500 miles (instead of the usual 500) in the Alaska, 
America West, Northwest, United, USAir or Air Canada frequent-flier programs -- 
and there's no need to fly the selected airline on a given trip to collect the 
mileage credits. Members of Westin's Premier frequent-stay plan can also double 
dip, earning 1,000 program points per hotel stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Inter-Continental Extends Double Miles: The chain's Worldwide Global Business 
Options program has been extended through Dec. 31. The offer gives guests a 
choice of double airline mileage (with American, Canadian, Delta, TWA, United 
and several foreign carriers) or a selection of other perks. 
</P>
<P>
 Flexible Rules at Radisson: In a recent revision of its frequent-flier 
affiliation program, Radisson Hotels International decided that flying on the 
selected airline is no longer required to earn miles in that airline's program. 
Credit, Charge Cards 
</P>
<P>
 American Express Gold Card Gets Richer: American Express is testing an 
enhanced Gold Card for use by some existing Gold Card members. This one, called 
Rewards Plus, gives holders double mileage credit on the card during their 
first year for money spent with the program's airline and hotel partners. And 
it offers a service called MileageManager -- a consolidated monthly statement 
detailing all current activity and mileage-point totals in every frequent-flier 
or frequent-stay program to which members belong. The annual fee for the card 
is set at $125. American Express may offer MileageManager to other cardholders 
for a separate fee. 
</P>
<P>
 New Northwest, Hawaii Cards: Northwest has come out with a new World Perks 
Business Card that lets employees of the firms who sign up for the card earn 
one WorldPerks mile for each dollar charged to the card. The program targets 
businesses with fewer than 1,500 employees. Hawaii's first co-branded card is 
the Aloha AirAwards Card, a MasterCard from Aloha Airlines and First Hawaiian 
Bank. Users earn credits good for free trips on Aloha and IslandAir, among 
other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 New Generic Airline Visa: Banc One has created a new TravelPlus Visa card 
((800) 945-2001), unaffiliated with any airline, that allows users to earn one 
point for each dollar charged. Once you earn enough points (12,000 to 20,000 
for a free domestic ticket, depending upon destination), the bank buys a 
round-trip coach ticket for you on whichever airline offers the best fare. 
Drawbacks: You can't select a carrier, you may have to meet Saturday-stay rules 
or other restrictions and you can't apply TravelPlus points to any airline's 
frequent-flier program.

<P>
 James Glucksman decided to fly from Moscow to Vladivostok the long way. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than fly direct on a Russian airline, the Washington-based health care 
consultant decided to take Austrian Airlines to Tokyo, ride a Japanese bullet 
train north to Niigata, then catch the closest flight back into Vladivostok. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eleven hours on Aeroflot is just too much of a risk," Glucksman said.  
</P>
<P>
 Glucksman's reticence to fly Aeroflot or smaller Russian airlines spun off 
from it isn't unusual. Crashes and overloaded jets have become part of the lore 
for Aeroflot, the monopolistic airline that to outsiders is perhaps the most 
visible vestige of the former Soviet empire. 
</P>
<P>
 In late October, the problem was driven home when two crashes killed 26 people 
in Siberia, both involving two small, newly privatized airlines.  
</P>
<P>
 China's state-run airline system carries a similar stigma. As foreigners pour 
into both China and Russia to tour and explore business opportunities, they 
quickly learn the philosophy among their veteran colleagues: Don't fly if you 
can avoid it. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, the U.S. government banned federal employees from flying on 
Russian airlines except in emergencies, but it rescinded the ban in October for 
airlines that can fly internationally. Still, officials and travel agents often 
suggest using international carriers to get around the region, even if it means 
much greater expense and longer flights.  
</P>
<P>
 The gripes about the airlines aren't limited to fears of crashing. Passengers 
talk of bad food, seats that flop back into the laps behind them and even an 
occasional flight with a barnyard animal or two. 
</P>
<P>
 "People hate to fly within Russia and, lately, China," said Francis Goranin of 
Vega International Travel Service Inc. in Chicago. Overcrowded, smelly Russian 
trains make rail travel an unacceptable alternative for many, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Airline Passengers Assn. recommends that travelers also fly 
out of China, then back in, to avoid domestic Chinese carriers. This can pose 
absurdly circuitous routes, such as flying from Beijing south to Hong Kong, 
then Hong Kong north to Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have to fly domestic, at least fly Western-built equipment," said 
David Stempler, executive director of the IAPA. "There seems to be bad 
chemistry between Russian aircraft and Chinese aviation." 
</P>
<P>
 The Civil Aviation Administration of China, which runs the state-owned 
airlines, has promised improvements. But seasoned foreign travelers remain 
skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Morrison, a China scholar and dean of the graduate school at the 
University of Rhode Island, said he tries to fly at odd hours in China to avoid 
traffic delays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been in hold over Shanghai or Beijing and said more than a few 
prayers. . . . If I have a reasonably short jaunt, or the time, I take the 
train," Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people looking to get around western Russia or other former Soviet 
republics take Lufthansa to Frankfurt before flying back in, or use Finnair to 
Helsinki, Goranin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The IAPA says gate agents in former Soviet states are frequently open to 
accepting bribes to book a seat, even if the seat is already filled, and 
sometimes passengers end up sitting in the aisle. Crashes have been blamed on 
planes burdened with too much cargo. One of the planes that crashed in October 
was carrying 12 tons of fish products and four automobiles.  
</P>
<P>
 In one highly publicized incident last April, a crash was reportedly caused by 
a pilot's child playing in the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
 The IAPA is concerned not only about Russian airlines but also the entire air 
traffic control system. "Do not fly to, in or over Russia," is the advice IAPA 
gives its members. 
</P>
<P>
 Charters are available for affluent travelers. Commonwealth Express, a 
Florida-based company that arranges charters in the former Soviet Union, 
recently handled a round trip for four people from Moscow to Saratov -- about 1 
1/2 hours each way -- for $10,000. A round-trip ticket on Aeroflot would have 
been $184. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three years Commonwealth has been arranging flights for Westerners on a 
British Aerospace jet flown by pilots trained in England, the company has seen 
business grow for flights within Russia, said Verity Minahan, the company's 
director of planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives for Boeing Co. don't have much choice but to fly the local airline.

 MEXICAN STOCKS 
</P>
<P>
 * Mexican stocks rebounded 2.08% after two days of decline. Investors were 
optimistic about gross domestic product figures for the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 * The increase in U.S. interest rates might force Mexico's central bank to 
raise local rates to attract the foreign investment necessary to fund the 
nation's economic development. "The Mexican market is hurt by two negative 
factors: higher interest rates and the fact that the political situation is 
still unclear," said Jorge Placido, a trader at Vectormex Casa de Bolsa. 
Investors fear the split within the ruling party -- between reformers and 
conservatives fearful of losing their perquisites and power -- will hamper 
pro-business polices.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; PALESTINIANS PLOD LONG ROAD TO STABILITY; MIDDLE EAST: 
NONPROFIT GROUP BUILDERS FOR PEACE HAS ANNOUNCED NINE BUSINESS VENTURES IN GAZA 
AND THE WEST BANK. BUT SKEPTICS SAY POOR INFRASTRUCTURE MAY THWART ITS EFFORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like the signers of the historic peace agreement that spawned its creation, 
the nonprofit group working to bring economic development to the Palestinian 
territories of Gaza and the West Bank has seen the euphoria of a year ago 
dissipate under the harsh realities of the politics of the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 But Builders for Peace plods along in its efforts to broker business deals in 
the economically depressed territories and in Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization was created last year by Vice President Al Gore after Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman 
Yasser Arafat signed the accord giving limited autonomy to Palestinians in the 
territories. The mission of Builders for Peace was to buttress the peace 
process with economic ventures that would help improve the miserable living 
conditions in the territories. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-chaired by former U.S. Rep. Mel Levine and James Zogby of the Arab American 
Institute, the group of Arab American and Jewish business people was partly 
successful in meeting its goals. It has announced nine projects, including a 
hotel, a housing development, and manufacturing plants to produce olive oil, 
bottled water, furniture and other goods. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the ventures represent about $100 million in investment and should 
produce about 5,000 jobs in a region with an unemployment rate of 50% to 60%, 
said Levine, a Democrat who represented the Santa Monica area for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the tip of the iceberg," he said in explaining plans for a tuna 
cannery, a plastics manufacturer and a Pepsi bottling plant, among other 
projects in early development. "Frankly, I believe that the interest and 
success of (potential investors) will depend on the success of these nine 
projects." 
</P>
<P>
 But the group has also encountered skepticism about its prospects for success, 
partly because Gaza and the West Bank have poor infrastructure, including 
financial and legal systems, to support such businesses.  
</P>
<P>
 It was hoped that the World Bank and other international lending agencies 
would fund the water treatment plants, roads and other such infrastructure 
projects needed in the territories, but the process has been delayed by 
dissatisfaction with Arafat's administrative procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine acknowledged that the large projects to be funded by donor nations are 
"going more slowly than anyone wanted." But he added: "Our mission never was 
infrastructure. It was always the individual business projects. Clearly, 
infrastructure is needed, but that's beyond our scope." 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics have also complained that some of the projects brokered by 
Builders for Peace, such as a flashy hotel, are not appropriate for the area. 
Said Levine: "We are in no place to decide which companies need to go there. 
They bring jobs and improvements to the economy. Whether large or small, they 
contribute to the same goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Shadowing Builders for Peace's efforts are the terrorist attacks on Israel by 
Palestinian militants and Israel's retaliatory actions in the territories.  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Palestinian militants were holding an Israeli soldier (later killed in 
a rescue attempt) hostage last month when Builders for Peace brought together 
American investors and Palestinian businessmen at a Beverly Hills dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 That environment may worry potential investors, but none of the applicants for 
loans and other financial support from the Overseas Private Investment Corp. 
for projects in the territories has withdrawn because of the continuing 
violence, said OPIC representative Walter Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite recent troubles, Israelis and Palestinians are moving toward 
coexistence, said Khaled Quotob, a manager of the Palestinian Agricultural 
Marketing Assn., who attended the Beverly Hills dinner. "I'm looking for 
aggressive American companies who are willing to come over and do business." 
</P>
<P>
 Sabri Farra, an Arab American who heads a construction and trade company in 
Gaza, said the company's projects have not been hampered by the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not threatened in any way at all," Farra said. "We're not just going 
there to make money and quit. We're there for the long term." However, he said 
the firm is concerned about the slow pace of infrastructure improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very much interested in seeing things developed. The U.S. government 
needs to speed its assistance to the area," he said.

 EU Says Airlines May Get Special Aid: The European Commission, the executive 
body of the European Union, said carriers that have received state aid can get 
more under special circumstances, a decision that could help Spain's 
cash-strapped national airline, Iberia, but threaten successful airlines such 
as British Airways and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. British Airways and KLM, vocal 
opponents of aid, and other carriers have sued to overturn the $3.2 billion in 
state aid recently granted to Air France. If the suit, brought in the European 
Court of Justice, is successful, the commission could be forced to reconsider 
its position.

 Nations Pledge $2 Billion to Vietnam: Rich donor nations pledged the amount in 
aid and low-interest loans to support the Hanoi government's economic reform 
program, the World Bank said in a statement. The cash, which was promised 
following a two-day meeting at the World Bank's offices in Paris, is slightly 
more than the $1.8 billion Vietnam got a year ago, just after Japan and France 
sponsored the Communist state's return to the international financial community 
by covering some of its debts.

SOUTHWEST ADDS PHOENIX TO ITS DAILY FLIGHTS; AIRLINES: LOW-COST CARRIER AT JOHN 
WAYNE AIRPORT WILL CHARGE $79 EACH WAY. COMPETITOR AMERICA WEST NOW CHARGES 
$183 BUT SAYS IT EXPECTS TO MATCH THE LOWER FARE FOR MOST SEATS. 
</P>

<P>
 Southwest Airlines said Wednesday that it will begin service Jan. 15 from John 
Wayne Airport to Phoenix with four daily flights at $79 each way. 
</P>
<P>
 That fare will be less than half of the $183 one-way fare now being charged by 
America West Airlines, the major carrier on the route, which has five daily 
flights from Orange County to Phoenix. An America West official said the 
carrier expects to match Southwest's fare for most seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest said the four new flights will be in addition to the 17 daily 
flights the airline already offers from Orange County to Oakland, San Jose and 
Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that is going to be very, very good," said Thom Nulty, president of 
Associated Travel Management, a travel agency chain based in Santa Ana. Service 
to Phoenix, he said, now costs "more than it should." 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest officials have said they are eager to increase their number of 
flights at John Wayne. The airport strictly limits the number of flights as a 
way of reducing noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest was able to add the four flights by agreeing to operate them in a 
more restrictive noise category, which sometimes requires airlines to limit the 
number of passengers they carry or the amount of fuel, said John Leyerle, the 
airport's chief access and noise officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix is not only an important destination for Orange County business 
travelers, it is also Southwest's major gateway to nonstop flights bound for 20 
other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just really going to open the door for people traveling out of Orange 
County," said Cheryl Hoban, an Orange County-based marketing representative for 
Southwest. "Right now, they are fairly restricted." 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest started Orange County service in May with eight flights a day to San 
Jose and seven a day to Oakland. It also picked up two daily flights to St. 
Louis when it bought Morris Air Service earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, travelers can potentially connect with any of the 164 Southwest daily 
flights out of Phoenix. The airport there is also used for connections by 
America West, which is competing with Southwest on many of its short-haul 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not totally unexpected," said Marilyn Hoppe, an America West vice 
president, adding that Southwest's expansion is not unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she does not expect a major effect on America West's business, 
though, because the two carriers serve different markets, with America West 
offering amenities like meals and advance seat reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest, based in Dallas, has been one of the few consistently profitable 
airlines in the past few years. The carrier's strategy is to offer no-frills 
service and rock-bottom fares on short-distance flights. 
</P>
<P>
 It eschews travel agent reservation systems, reserved seating and meals. It 
also has mastered the ability to reload planes quickly.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: INVESTOR'S LAWSUIT SEEKS TO BLOCK AMERIQUEST SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 AmeriQuest Technologies Inc. said Wednesday that it has been sued by an 
investor seeking to block a proposed sale of the company to a German 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, which seeks class-action status, alleges that the board of 
AmeriQuest breached its fiduciary duty when it agreed Monday to sell a majority 
stake to Computer 2000 AG, a German hardware and software distributor. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition, subject to approval of both companies' shareholders, would 
provide the first foothold for a European distributor in the U.S. microcomputer 
market, Computer 2000 said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit was filed in Delaware by shareholder Erica Hartman. Her stake in 
AmeriQuest was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 AmeriQuest, based in Irvine, distributes microcomputer systems, peripherals 
and software to computer resellers, systems integrators and retailers. Company 
officials could not be reached for comment Wednesday.

 Emissions Omissions: Brea-based American Suzuki Motor Co. agreed last week to 
pay a $194,000 fine to the federal Environmental Protection Agency to settle 
two dozen alleged violations of the Clean Air Act that occurred between 1989 
and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it reported the problems to the EPA after an internal review 
of procedures at the Suzuki technical center in Michigan revealed that 
employees did not notify the agency of some tests and maintenance procedures on 
cars used to generate emission data. 
</P>
<P>
 Suzuki officials characterized the problems as "technical difficulties." They 
said that all of the company's vehicles have met federal emissions standards 
and that the company did not benefit in any manner from the errors.

PACIFICARE POSTS RECORD EARNINGS OF $90.2 MILLION IN 1994; PERFORMANCE: THE 
CYPRESS HEALTH-CARE PROVIDER, WHOSE REVENUE ROSE TO $2.9 BILLION, ATTRIBUTES 
GAINS TO MEMBERSHIP GROWTH AND COST CONTROLS.

<P>
 PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. reported Wednesday that both its profit and 
revenue reached record levels for the latest fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, a provider of managed health-care services, posted income before 
an accounting change of $84.6 million, or $3.02 a share. That was up from 
earnings of $62.7 million, or $2.25 a share a year, for the previous 12 months. 
Earnings after the accounting change were $90.2 million, or $3.22 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue for the company's fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, increased by more 
than 30% to $2.9 billion from $2.2 billion for the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Hoops, PacifiCare's president and chief executive officer, tied the gains 
to membership growth and health-care cost controls. PacifiCare's membership was 
1,358,219 as of Sept. 30, up 24% from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Total health-care costs as a percentage of premium revenue fell to 83.1% from 
84.1%, Hoops said, "due mainly to lower inpatient costs." Overhead expenses, 
however, rose slightly during the year as PacifiCare continued to spend money 
on product development and to expand into new areas, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company now has members in California, Florida, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas 
and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-quarter profit was $22.2 million, or 79 cents a share, compared to 
earnings of $17.1 million, or 61 cents a share, for the same period a year 
earlier. Three-month revenue rose 29% to $781 million from $605 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In Wednesday's Nasdaq trading, PacifiCare's Class A stock was down 75 cents to 
close at $68.25. Its Class B shares gained $1 to close at $66.75. Winning 
Streak 
</P>
<P>
 PacifiCare ended its 50th consecutive profitable quarter on Sept. 30. 
Fourth-quarter revenue, profit and earnings per share all grew well beyond 
totals for the comparable 1993 period. The company attributed the gains to a 
24% increase in membership, coupled with health care cost-control measures.

BRIEFCASE: AUTOS; HARD TO GET A HANDLE ON FIRST O.C.-DESIGNED HYUNDAI CONCEPT 
CAR

 Officials at Hyundai Motor America in Fountain Valley have released a sketch 
of their newest concept car, the HCD III, but won't say much about the 
prototype except to describe it as a "multipurpose vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
 A full-size model is scheduled to be rolled out Jan. 4 at the North American 
International Auto Show in Detroit for inspection by the news media, other car 
companies and the public. 
</P>
<P>
 But a close look at the rendering reveals a few details about the car, 
including the fact that, if built, it would be the littlest Hyundai -- a 
two-seat hardtop. 
</P>
<P>
 The louvered portion of the top could be a fold-up section to open the cockpit 
to the sun on warm days.  
</P>
<P>
 The handles on each side of the rear window remain a mystery -- perhaps 
they're there for hitchhiking skateboarders or as handholds for a rumble seat 
concealed in the open rear end of the car. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing Hyundai does say about the HCD III: It is the first concept car 
designed and built entirely in the company's Fountain Valley studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous concept cars -- a convertible and a sports coupe -- were 
collaborations between Hyundai studios in South Korea and Orange County.

 Dealing With Minorities: When the National Assn. of Minority Automobile 
Dealers met recently in Washington, representatives of four Southland auto 
companies were there to listen to their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress-based Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America sent two dealer development 
managers to explain the company's 3-month-old Market Investment Program under 
which Mitsubishi provides up to 85% of the money needed to start a new 
dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, where land costs are among the highest in the nation, 
that can easily hit $1 million, dealers say. Mitsubishi becomes a partner in 
the dealership, but provides an opportunity for the dealer to buy out its share 
over a five-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, only one dealer -- not a minority -- has been accepted into the 
program. A Southern California dealership is next on the list, and Mitsubishi 
wants a minority dealer for it, said Joseph Zeuli, dealer development manager. 
Of the company's 512 dealers, 18 are minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Other companies with representatives at the minority dealer session were 
Irvine-based Mazda Motor America Inc., and Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc. and 
Honda North America Inc., both based in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazda said 19 of the company's 900 dealers are minorities, including five who 
started this year.  
</P>
<P>
 The company, which has had a minority recruitment consultant for three years, 
expects to add three minority-owned dealerships by Jan. 1, for a total of 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Toyota's 1,191 dealers in the United States include 42 minorities. The 
company's Lexus division has 172 dealers, of whom three are minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 At Honda, the 1,300 Honda and Acura dealers in the United States include 55 
minorities.

 InVitro International: The Irvine maker of product safety tests said it lost 
$4.4 million, or 38 cents a share, for the 1994 fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 
compared to a year-earlier net loss of $3.7 million, or 56 cents a 
share.Revenue declined to $1.7 million from $1.9 million. The fourth-quarter 
net loss was $1.3 million, which included onetime charges of $300,000 from 
reducing the company's European operations. That compares to a net loss of $1.2 
million, or 16 cents a share, for the fourth quarter last year. Revenue fell to 
$464,000 from $647,000.

 Alessi Inc.: The Irvine electronics testing company said Wednesday that it has 
agreed to be acquired by Cascade Microtech Inc. of Beaverton, Ore., a company 
that makes equipment for testing microchip designs. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter of intent was signed by Cascade and Alessi parent Dukane Corp. of 
St. Charles, Ill. Terms of the proposed deal were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 A Cascade spokeswoman said that most of Alessi's work force of about 50 will 
stay intact under the acquisition. A few managerial positions in both companies 
may be consolidated. 
</P>
<P>
 Alessi was founded in 1967 as an electronic testing firm. The company moved 
along with the industry into testing integrated circuits, including designing 
and marketing devices that test liquid-crystal displays.

HANDICRAFTERS ARE GETTING WITH THE PROGRAM; COMPUTERS: THOSE WHO ENJOY HOME 
CRAFTS ARE FINDING SPECIAL PC PROGRAMS HELPFUL, PARTICULARLY IN DESIGNING AND 
MAKING HOLIDAY GIFTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIAN MARINO, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>

<P>
 This holiday season, crafty gift givers will be stringing beads, arranging 
silk flowers, painting shirts, sewing ornaments -- and importing their favorite 
fonts and icons into their multimegabyte art programs. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing wrong with this homey picture. The age-old tradition of 
crafting is taking a more high-tech approach with software for the creative 
person who also owns a personal computer. 
</P>
<P>
 There are computer-generated greeting cards, gift wrapping paper, calendars, 
address labels and decoupage flowers to be made. One program even lets the home 
artisan concoct almost any kind of design for gift items that can be ordered 
within seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Are artisans worried about mixing silk screens with PC screens? Hardly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see it as helping, not replacing many crafts," said Susan Brandt, assistant 
executive director of the Hobby Industry Assn. in Elmwood Park, N.J. 
"Ironically, a great many crafters are not really very talented. This can just 
make the things you make more professional looking." 
</P>
<P>
 Talent notwithstanding, Americans do love to create -- whether they do it to 
relax, save money or make money -- and they're doing so in increasing numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ninety percent of all U.S. households now have at least one person engaged in 
craft work, up from 82% two years ago and 64% in 1988, a recent HIA survey 
found. The trade group says 79% of home crafters gave their projects as gifts, 
while 49% used them for holiday decorating. 
</P>
<P>
 That can create some healthy revenue for sellers of raw materials and kits, 
considering that the average crafter makes 11 to 23 purchases a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Michaels Stores Inc., the nation's largest craft store chain, says sales 
jumped 50% from 1991 to 1993. For the whole industry, sales totaled $9.63 
billion in 1993, up from $6.82 billion in 1991, according to HIA. 
</P>
<P>
 The popularity of home crafting has hardly gone unnoticed by software makers. 
They're rushing out programs to make creativity a little easier with advanced 
tools that manipulate text, photos, graphics, even sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "The computer gives you a new outlet for creativity," said David Tremblay, 
research director for the Software Publishers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The SPA reports that sales on the wholesale level in the home creativity 
category, including art and craft programs, jumped 106% during the first half 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 While some programs are designed to help with a specific craft -- like 
creating stencils and needlework patterns or computing dimensions for 
woodworking -- others act like mini-craft shops themselves when working with a 
printer (preferably color) and specialized paper. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Print Artist by Maxis lets you make personalized stationery and 
calendars, among other things. Print Shop Deluxe by Broderbund makes posters 
and decoupage flowers, MECC's Tessel Mania! has fancy patterns for 
gift-wrapping, and Microsoft's Special Occasions DesignPack has dozens of 
special occasion greeting card designs. 
</P>
<P>
 Any good word processing or art program can also produce things like address 
labels, gift tags, business cards, place mats, coloring books or personalized 
storybooks. Each has its own fancy borders, picture "icons" or letter fonts 
that can be "imported," or shared with one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Family PC magazine, which calls the computer "a craft maker's dream," suggests 
using a simple drawing program to make redeemable home coupons. "Favors can 
range from bed-making chores to treating the recipient like a king or queen for 
a day," it says. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxis Corp., publisher of Print Artist, takes a more sophisticated approach. 
Its just-released Gift Maker program lets users put personalized designs, even 
photographs, on an assortment of merchandise, from $9.95 Christmas ornaments to 
$68.95 Windbreaker jackets, using hundreds of design templates, canned graphics 
and special fonts. 
</P>
<P>
 The items, made by Artistic Greetings of Elmira, N.Y., can be ordered in 
seconds via computer modem or by mailing a floppy disk. 
</P>
<P>
 Teaming low-tech crafting with the latest in high technology may seem like an 
unlikely mix, but even some of the more traditional artisans are crossing the 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came to it kicking and screaming," said Kenn Oberrecht, an avid woodworker 
from North Bend, Ore., and author of "How to Open and Operate a Home-Based 
Craft Business." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I wonder why I didn't use it three or four years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Oberrecht says the $100 woodworking program he recently purchased cuts by 25% 
the time it takes to make his beloved wooden mug trees, planters, bookcases and 
tables -- items often given as gifts during the holidays. After plugging in 
dimensions for a desired project, the computer tells him where to cut on a 
block of wood and even what to do with leftover wood pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 "The work isn't always fun. This takes away a lot of the tedium involved," he 
said, noting the availability of similar time-saving programs for other crafts 
often advertised in specialized publications. 
</P>
<P>
 For all its advantages, though, Oberrecht doesn't think the tools of the 
computer will ever match the human skill or the thrill of dreaming up creations 
and assembling them with your hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like wondering if electronic newspapers will replace hard print," he 
said. "I still think people like to sit down with a newspaper. As far as crafts 
are concerned, it's the same thing."

THE FINAL FRONTIER; 'STAR TREK' FANS PIQUED THAT KIRK MAY NOT LIVE LONG AND 
PROSPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 Call it Star Trek: The Generation Gap. 
</P>
<P>
 From Germany to Granada Hills, "Star Trek" fans are jamming the phone lines to 
reach Joyce Mason, president of an international William Shatner fan club, 
protesting what the rumor mill says is the death of their hero, starship Capt. 
James T. Kirk, in the new "Trek" movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Disgruntled followers of the original 1960s TV series feel that Shatner's 
space-traveling patriarch is being knocked off to clear the way for movies with 
the cast of "Star Trek: The Next Generation," the sequel series that also drew 
a big following in its seven-year TV run that ended last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 What brings the parent-child battle to a head is Paramount Pictures' release 
this Friday of "Star Trek: Generations," featuring actors from both series. 
Prominent among them is Kirk's replacement as captain of a later edition of the 
USS Enterprise, Jean-Luc Picard, played by bald British actor Patrick Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had many people calling in to ask me to help them stop the death of 
Kirk," said Mason, president of the 1,200-member International William Shatner 
Connection and host of the syndicated cable radio show "Talk Trek." 
</P>
<P>
 She said some callers have threatened to boycott the movie and others plan to 
buy tickets to other films at multiplex theaters this weekend and sneak into 
the "Trek" feature, so their patronage won't benefit the film's box-office 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a hopeless feeling" for Capt. Kirk fans, Mason said. "There is a deep 
resentment there because they feel that Paramount doesn't care how they feel. 
Kirk's the hero you grew up looking up to. . . . I enjoy the idea of the 
captains sharing the screen together, but if they finish off the first 
generation so that fans have no other choice but to turn to the next 
generation, that's a bit of a cheat." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Mason will get Trekkers' feelings about the film in the Tujunga 
studio of "Talk Trek," which broadcasts an audio-only talk show to 10 million 
cable television subscribers nationwide. The station has been receiving nearly 
100 calls a week from distraught fans, according to station managers. 
</P>
<P>
 But not every Trekker is eager to save Kirk from boldly going on a one-way 
trip to the planet of superannuated heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Engel, a Topanga Canyon writer who scripted last spring's unauthorized 
biography, "Gene Roddenberry: The Myth and the Man Behind Star Trek," said 
Paramount has to consider a new generation of Trekkers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The original cast is too old," Engel said. "They can't go on saving the 
universe forever. Kirk has had a 28-year run. There comes a time when even 
Douglas MacArthur retires." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who agree: Shatner himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked Wednesday if he would ever play Kirk again, Shatner said he doubted it. 
</P>
<P>
 He's flattered by the fans' reaction, but "we've gotten to the age where we 
can't remember where the stars are," quipped Shatner, 63, a Valley resident. 
"In the case of Dr. McCoy, he can't remember our names," he said, referring to 
the sidekick character played by DeForest Kelley. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be hard for Paramount to come up with any better end to the story of 
the original characters than that contained in the film, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But even Shatner's comfort with the idea that it is time for Kirk to go 
quietly into the dark is unlikely to quell his fans' uproar, Engel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't please all 'Star Trek' fans," Engel said. "They fight over which 
'Trek' is better. Nobody wants to see their favorite character die." 
</P>
<P>
 They are unlikely to be mollified, he said, even by the knowledge that "Star 
Trek" has become an industry. Paramount plans future "Next Generation" films, 
and there are two more TV spinoffs -- the current "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine" 
and the upcoming "Star Trek: Voyager." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Phyllis Gutierrez, who presides over the Bakersfield chapter of the 
International Federation of Trekkers, said it is time for classic 'Trek' fans 
to let go. "I think some of these people need to go out and get a life 
someplace," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the new film, Picard, a 24th-Century spaceman, employs a mysterious time 
nexus to seek help from Kirk, who lives in the 23rd Century, in defeating a 
nefarious alien known as Dr. Soran, played by Malcolm McDowell. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Paramount executives claim the film clearly marks the passage of the 
Enterprise helm from one generation to the next, they have kept mum about 
whether Kirk really does die, hoping that fans will flock to the film to see 
for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Trekker John Weaver of Reseda will wear a black strip of tape on his "Star 
Trek" insignia to the theater, just in case. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like when cops wear black stripes on their badges to commemorate 
fallen officers," said Weaver, 29, a Kirk fan since he was 5 years old. After 
viewing the film, Weaver said, he will decide whether to mount a letter-writing 
campaign. "I'm in love too much with Kirk's character to let him die." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the "Trek" and its characters have a habit of coming back from the 
dead, which may explain the studio's coyness when it comes to whether Kirk is 
actually stone cold, nevermore, defunct. 
</P>
<P>
 The series' cancellation in 1969 sparked a letter-writing campaign to 
Paramount, in which Mason and many other Trekkers participated. Although the 
series returned only in reruns, the outcry signified that the original cast and 
the story's appeal were still so strong that Paramount put them on the big 
screen in six "Trek" movies. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of those films, "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan," the beloved Mr. 
Spock died. The storm of outrage from fans was so strong that the next film was 
dedicated to stretching the bounds of reason to bring him back to life. 
</P>
<P>
 Mason, an office manager and a Kirk fan since the first episode of "Star Trek" 
aired in 1966, fears the worst for her hero. "They've been trying to kill Kirk 
for 30 years," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kirk's future may be dark, Shatner's is not. 
</P>
<P>
 After the series ended, he spent several years playing a cop in "T.J. Hooker" 
and is now seen regularly as the host of "Rescue: 911." Shatner also wrote the 
popular "Tek War" series of science fiction novels and will produce and star in 
a cable television series by that name to be broadcast beginning in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Does that mean we will never see Shatner on the bridge of the Enterprise 
again? That Kirk is really, actually, truly dead? 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way I could meet the 'Next Generation' cast again would be to come 
back as T.J. Hooker and bop a couple of them on the head," Shatner mused. 
"Especially the Klingon guy." 
</P>

Rick Berman questions about Capt. Kirk's role in the new Star Trek film, view

CITY DISTRIBUTES FUNDS FOR RECREATION PROJECTS; SEPULVEDA: BASIN WILL GET NEW 
FACILITIES AND EXPANDED WILDLIFE HABITAT, PAID FOR MOSTLY WITH COUNTY 
PROPOSITION A MONEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council, using $5.6 million in county park funds, moved 
ahead Wednesday to improve recreation facilities in the Sepulveda Basin and to 
fund a major expansion of a wildlife habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds to build new park facilities were part of $27.5 million in county 
Proposition A funds that the council accepted to fund some long-neglected 
recreation projects throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Valley projects will be completed by 1996 and paid for entirely 
with money from Proposition A, a voter-approved measure adopted in 1992 to fund 
new recreation and park improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the largest Valley project is a $4.1-million wildlife habitat 
expansion project for migratory birds in the Sepulveda Basin, to be funded in 
part by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which owns the 2,100-acre park. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, most of the improvements in the Valley will take place in the basin, 
which is undergoing a larger expansion and preservation plan in a partnership 
between the city and the Corps of Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion of the wildlife habitat will nearly double the current 108 acres 
of habitat provided around Balboa Lake, the 11-acre home to 200 bird species, 
including great blue herons, egrets and red-tailed hawks. 
</P>
<P>
 The lakeside area targeted for the expansion is undeveloped open space with 
little or no vegetation. Under the expansion, the city will plant native 
vegetation and build walkways and an information kiosk for schoolchildren on 
field trips, said James Ward, principal maintenance supervisor in the Valley 
for the city's Recreation and Parks Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is using $2 million in Proposition A funds for the expansion, with 
the balance coming from the Corps of Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 Another $810,000 will be spent to build two cricket fields on four acres of 
undeveloped land near the Donald C. Tillman Water Reclamation Plant. The fields 
are expected to be used by the Southern California Cricket Assn., which was 
recently displaced from its regular fields in Griffith Park, park officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also accepted $765,000 for new landscaping and improvements around 
the Balboa Recreation Center, which was built two years ago without surrounding 
landscaping, Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will pay to install an irrigation system and to rewire lighting for 
an adjacent soccer field so that the lights can be controlled from within the 
recreation center, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a face lift of Balboa Park," Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
 The recreation center has been in dire need of landscaping, said Karen 
Constine, chief of staff for Councilwoman Laura Chick, who represents the area. 
"It's going to really help the park," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the funds will be used as follows: 
</P>
<P>
 * $675,000 to pave a dirt parking lot adjacent to four softball diamonds at 
the Hjelte Sports Center in the Sepulveda Basin and build two diamonds with 
lighting and a meeting room for the players. 
</P>
<P>
 * $500,000 to restore an outdoor amphitheater at Lanark Recreation Center in 
Canoga Park that lacks lighting and electrical outlets. The money will also pay 
to enlarge a parking lot, add park lighting and improve the irrigation system 
at the park. 
</P>
<P>
 * $450,000 to develop picnic areas, parking and landscaping around the 
entrance to the basin's Woodley Lake, which Ward said is "very stale and 
static-looking." 
</P>
<P>
 * $250,000 to buy a small strip of vacant land owned by the county in North 
Hollywood to be developed as a small park with picnic tables, trees and grass. 
</P>
<P>
 * $150,000 to improve the irrigation system, lighting and landscaping at a 
small nine-acre park in Studio City.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: LATINO EDUCATORS MOUNT CONFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the goal of infusing Mexican and Mexican-American culture in the 
curriculum at California schools, the Assn. of Mexican American Educators, a 
statewide coalition, is holding a conference this weekend in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Titled "Teaching Through the Windows of Culture," the three-day conference at 
the Burbank Hilton Hotel and Convention Center will feature workshops, lectures 
and panel discussions dealing with issues related to teaching Latino children. 
</P>
<P>
 A special presentation, "Post 187 Agenda . . . Strategies for Our Community," 
will be held Saturday. Representatives from local government, the Los Angeles 
Unified School District and Latino organizations will speak. 
</P>

 The works of Latina authors also will be discussed, said Art Barragan, an 
assistant principal at Porter Middle School in Granada Hills. "This helps to 
validate the students' culture, to encourage them to feel positive," he said.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; NEIGHBORS UPSET ABOUT NEARBY FUMES

 It was rotten eggs, or a disturbingly similar odor, anyway, that brought Van 
Nuys residents out in force for a meeting at the Donald C. Tillman Water 
Reclamation Plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go to a lot of community meetings, and the meeting . . . was rather 
spectacular," said Glenn Bailey, a founding member of the Coalition to Save the 
Sepulveda Basin. "It was standing room only." 
</P>
<P>
 About 75 neighbors of the plant at 6100 Woodley Ave. were on hand Tuesday 
night to encourage Tillman officials to do something to quell the odors, which 
some said literally have been giving them headaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's pretty horrendous; sometimes it's not that bad," said Chris 
Gross, president of the neighborhood association at the nearby Midvalley 
Estates. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant treats raw sewage and filters the water for use in recreational 
ponds in the nearby Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area. A $1.2-million project to 
seal sewage channels, add air ducts and fans and clamp the lid on offensive 
odors is under way, with several improvements already in place, officials said. 
But the project is not scheduled to be completed until late in 1996 and the 
smell is as bad as ever, some neighbors say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely realize that our plant is producing odors," said Stanton Smith, 
associate engineer at the facility, adding that neighbors were "justifiably 
upset." 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Furuta, assistant director of the city's Bureau of Sanitation, said the 
plant is working on a "reasonably aggressive schedule," considering the amount 
of red tape on any $1.2-million municipal project. But, he added: "We will do 
everything we can to accelerate the process." 
</P>
<P>
 While some residents have complained that the odors seem to have aggravated 
their allergies and asthma, health assessments have shown no harmful 
conditions, Furuta said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, federal mandates requiring the removal of heavy metals from 
reclaimed water may have exacerbated the situation since going into effect two 
years ago, Lewis said. Hydrogen sulfide, believed responsible for the most 
offensive of the odors, tends to bond with such heavy metals, he said. With the 
cleaner water, the hydrogen sulfide is released into the air. ERIC SLATER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: VOLUNTEERS ARE 'ARRESTED' FOR A GOOD CAUSE

 Peter Gaudet of Tarzana didn't know what kind of trouble he was getting into 
by going to the American Red Cross to donate blood. 
</P>
<P>
 But when he walked into the Red Cross district office in Van Nuys during his 
lunch break, he was handcuffed and thrown into jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The "charges" -- being a good person. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaudet was among the participants in the Red Cross' annual jail-and-bail 
fund-raiser Tuesday, in which volunteers turned themselves in to be "arrested." 
</P>
<P>
 They were then "charged" with crimes like "having a kind heart," and given the 
option of shelling out $300 for bail or calling as many friends as needed to 
pledge donations. 
</P>
<P>
 The money raised will go toward operating the organization's Van Nuys office, 
said Julia Montez, the executive director of the San Fernando Valley district 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're holding me here until I raise money for the Red Cross. Come on. 
Donate $10," Gaudet said to a friend he called while in the makeshift jail cell 
where he was surrounded by other "inmates" who were also on telephones. 
</P>
<P>
 With a huge stack of business cards in front of him, Juan Granada, a Red Cross 
board member, called fellow volunteers involved in community services to post 
his "bail". 
</P>
<P>
 Although he admitted it is not always easy to get people to donate money, 
Granada said the Red Cross' reputation, especially since the Northridge 
earthquake, helps coax them into giving. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will listen to you because they know it's for a good cause," Granada 
said. MAKI BECKER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: COUNCIL HEARS VIEWS ON REDEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council heard testimony Wednesday from about a dozen 
residents of the northeast San Fernando Valley who support a plan to use 
redevelopment powers to rebuild quake-damaged neighborhoods in that area. 
</P>
<P>
 Although only four people spoke against the idea, the council delayed until 
Nov. 29 a final decision on whether to establish an emergency redevelopment 
zone in the northeast Valley communities of Mission Hills, Pacoima and Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 The support voiced Wednesday was in stark contrast to public testimony Tuesday 
when the council heard dozens of Sherman Oaks residents speak out against an 
emergency redevelopment zone in that community. Those residents said they did 
not trust redevelopment officials to spend their tax dollars and to wield the 
power to condemn property. 
</P>
<P>
 As proposed, the redevelopment zone in the northeast Valley would stretch 
along hard-hit residential and commercial neighborhoods, particularly major 
thoroughfares such as Sepulveda, Van Nuys and Foothill boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's redevelopment laws allow local agencies to keep all the property 
tax generated by new construction in a project area and use that money to pay 
for improvements such as new streets, parks and sewers, as well as loans for 
quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the plan said the northeast Valley is in dire need of funding to 
rebuild quake-damaged businesses and homes. Most praised the city's Community 
Redevelopment Agency, thanking officials for proposing the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money becomes a seed, a seed that grows," said Randy Isenberg, the owner of 
the Bowling Center in Sylmar. "We want to provide the soil for that seed." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Richard Alarcon, who represents the area, said the CRA cannot solve 
all the problems in his district's working-class communities, but would help 
bolster other aide efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the save-all proposal," he said. "But it can be a very useful 
tool in the recovery." HUGO MARTIN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: PERIOD FOR QUAKE-AID APPLICATIONS EXPANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the third time in as many months, state and federal officials Wednesday 
extended the deadline for quake aid applications -- from today to Jan. 20 -- 
but vowed that it would be the final extension. 
</P>
<P>
 The extension applies to loan applications to the Small Business 
Administration and requests for aid from the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency and the state's Individual and Family Grant Program. 
</P>
<P>
 The extension was requested by Los Angeles city officials who argued that many 
victims are only now learning the extent of their damage and finding out how 
much of their repairs will be paid for by insurance settlements. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the SBA has approved low-interest loans to 110,214 homeowners, renters 
and business owners, totaling more than $3.55 billion. FEMA, meanwhile, has 
disbursed about $1.1 billion in grants for emergency repairs and rental and 
mortgage assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline had originally been extended from Sept. 17 to Oct. 17 and then 
again to Nov. 17. But federal officials said they would grant no further 
extensions. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the final extension of the application period for the Northridge 
earthquake," said Frank Kishton, FEMA's coordinating officer. "There will not 
be another extension." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to encourage quake-damaged businesses to take advantage of the 
extension, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan's office plans to send out about 
214,0000 notices to every registered business in the city, advising them of the 
extension. HUGO MARTIN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; MEETING TO ADDRESS RUPTURED PIPELINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Few residents of the city of San Fernando knew that a section of crude oil 
pipeline ran less than three feet beneath the classrooms of O'Melveny 
Elementary School -- until the Northridge earthquake struck. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6.8-magnitude shocker caused the 10-inch diameter steel pipe to rupture 
and explode near the school, igniting fires that seriously injured a man and 
torched homes and vehicles along Wolfskill Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, residents and city officials have monitored plans for the line -- 
shut down since the explosion -- with vigilance. 
</P>
<P>
 At a public meeting scheduled for 6 p.m. Monday at San Fernando City Hall, 
representatives from Atlantic Richfield Co., owner of the 130-mile Four Corners 
Pipe Line, and an engineer from the state fire marshal's office will discuss 
the possibility of reopening, rerouting or permanently closing the line. 
</P>
<P>
 The line, which connects Kern County oil fields to South Bay refineries, runs 
roughly north to south through the eastern section of town beneath O'Melveny 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Arco officials said Wednesday that the company has no immediate plans to 
reopen the 70-year-old crude oil conduit, one of two Arco-owned lines running 
through San Fernando. Since the earthquake, oil has been pumped through another 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 But city and state officials said Arco is contemplating several scenarios for 
the line, which burst at nine different points after the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents and parents of children who attend O'Melveny Elementary School were 
shocked to learn the pipeline ran just a few feet beneath the area where 
hundreds of children romp. 
</P>
<P>
 "The line goes right under the classrooms," said Elizabeth McCabe of Mission 
Hills, whose daughter is in second grade at O'Melveny. "It goes right under 
where the children line up for their emergency drills. We never even knew about 
it. Somebody should have told us." 
</P>
<P>
 After the explosion, the state fire marshal's office, which oversees pipeline 
safety, investigated the condition of the pipe, originally laid in the 1920s.  
</P>
<P>
 "If they want to reopen that line," said Nancy Wolfe, chief of the pipeline 
safety division for the fire marshal's office, "then Arco will have to follow 
the parameters we put down, including conducting costly tests and upgrading 
major segments of the line. Our understanding is that they are going to keep it 
closed down." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wolfe and Miriam Abad, administrative assistant in San Fernando's public 
works department, both said they have discussed with Arco other possibilities, 
including reopening the line and routing it away from the elementary school. 
Another possibility would be to lay a new line running parallel to Laurel 
Canyon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents say the bottom line is that the community be kept apprised of the 
situation. "The pipeline is still on many people's minds," McCabe said. "People 
were extremely fearful after it exploded." TIM MAY

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CANOGA PARK; KIDS' CAR SEATS ARRIVE JUST IN TIME AT SHELTER

 When Anne Williams, manager of a local shelter for battered women, needs 
donations for her clients, she says she doesn't worry about how she will get 
them. She says that somehow -- often as if by magic -- the badly needed items 
turn up. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the case of car seats for babies, which are at a premium in shelters. 
After she gave away the shelter's only car seat to a client who was leaving, 
she realized she would have to find a seat to replace it. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, a woman called the shelter saying she had 10 car seats she 
wanted to donate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny, whenever I need something, it just comes," Williams said. "I 
never mentioned it to anybody, and all of a sudden, this woman called the next 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 Arlene Wexler, the donor, said she and her husband, Harold, a Northridge 
chiropractor, traditionally hold a charity drive to help the needy during the 
holidays. Because of the publicity surrounding the slaying of Nicole Brown 
Simpson, she said, the couple decided to help battered women this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Wexler, who used to be in the baby-supplies business, had about 25 brand-new 
baby seats in storage in her garage. She said someone suggested she check with 
battered women's shelters and when she called around, she learned that the 
seats are in great demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had goose bumps when I heard the joy on the other end of the phone, when I 
talked to the shelter workers," Wexler said. 
</P>
<P>
 She then called manufacturers she knows and purchased about 75 more car seats, 
which retail for about $70. 
</P>
<P>
 Wexler said she plans to begin delivering the seats to shelters throughout the 
region in time for Christmas. Her husband, she said, is offering free office 
visits to clients who donate a toy for kids at the shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Williams said, the shelter is badly in need of clothes, blankets, 
baby formula, baby food and children's clothing and toys that are in good 
condition. Donors are asked to call Haven Hills Inc. at (818) 887-7481. 
</P>
<P>
 Wexler said the mood this holiday season has been especially poignant because 
of the January earthquake, which severely damaged the couple's home and nearly 
ruined her husband's practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realized that there were so many things we didn't need to be happy; how 
little we need materialistically," she said. FRANK MANNING

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; EQUESTRIAN CENTER HELPS IN TOY DRIVE

<P>
 The Los Angeles Equestrian Center, working with an organization that collects 
toys, clothing, books and other items for Native American children on 
reservations throughout the West, has set a Dec. 12 deadline to receive 
donations for a holiday drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cloud Indian Society in Irvine is trying to double the 3,400 
contributions it received last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Gifts, wrapped and labeled for a boy or a girl and with the recipient's age, 
can be dropped off from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday at the 
equestrian center, 480 Riverside Drive in Burbank. The children need new 
clothing, school and art supplies, toys and sports equipment for children from 
age 2 to the teen-age years. 
</P>
<P>
 The is the eighth year that the Red Cloud Society has run a toy drive campaign 
for poor Native Americans. The gifts go to children on 20 reservations or with 
Native American groups in North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana and Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 The society deals with issues such as hunger, housing and the education of 
Native Americans. The Equestrian Center joined the toy drive two years ago and 
collected about 100 toys that year, said Jana Olson-Collins, a center 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Other charities, such as the Telephone Pioneers of America, and businesses, 
such as Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, also donate toys. 
</P>
<P>
 Gift-wrapped items are preferred, but wrapping is not mandatory, Olson-Collins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The society also is collecting clothing and boots. ED BOND

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; COUNCIL APPROVES ITS OWN PAY RAISE 
</P>

<P>
 Burbank City Council members awarded themselves a 3% pay increase Tuesday, but 
not before they were lambasted for their investment in the financially troubled 
Media City Center shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The raise from $830 to $855 a month takes effect in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank homeowner Mike Nolan, 46, speaking to the council, opposed any pay 
increase this year. Nolan cited what he called the city's failure to properly 
oversee its ill-fated partnership with developer Alexander Haagen to build and 
manage the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "They deserve an 'F' because they failed us," he said after the council 
meeting. "They negotiated us to a point where (Haagen) gets the sites for an 
office building and hotel, and some sales tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "And in return for that, he's going to give the city a note for $10 million." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members have ended the city's involvement in the multimillion-dollar 
project through a $10-million buyout that becomes final Nov. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the original agreement between the Burbank Redevelopment Agency and 
Haagen, both sides were to split net profits after debt payments, 50-50. No 
profits have been generated since the mall opened in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a series of other agreements since then, much of the tax money 
generated by the shopping center has been diverted to Haagen for the next 22 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The council did not respond to Nolan's comments, focusing instead on the 
amount of the pay increase and whether present council members should be 
entitled to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to budget constraints, council members gave up their right to a 5% annual 
pay increase in 1992 and 1993. They settled for a 3.3% raise this year to match 
those given other city employees. 
</P>
<P>
 On a 4-1 vote Tuesday, the council again approved a raise that was less than 
what they could have received. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice Mayor Dave Golonski argued that next year's pay increase should be 
reserved for new council members. 
</P>
<P>
 But others wondered why newcomers to the council should be paid more than 
experienced members. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in an OK year," Mayor Bill Wiggins said. "We've got room in the budget 
for a pay increase. In my mind, we didn't take more or less than what we give 
our employees." VIVIEN LOU CHEN

JURY SAYS PRINCIPAL RETALIATED; COURTS: PANEL FINDS THAT VALLEY TEACHER WAS

 In the first lawsuit of its kind, a jury decided late Wednesday that a Tarzana 
school principal retaliated against a teacher after the teacher began 
complaining that the district was not following federal special education 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury deliberated just 1 1/2 hours before finding that Jacklyn Thompson -- 
one of several individuals named in the suit as well as the Los Angeles Unified 
School District -- had falsely accused teacher Sheila Hopper of child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson filed charges with police when both she and Hopper worked at Tarzana 
Elementary School and just one month after Hopper had lodged complaints against 
the district with the U.S. Department of Education in January, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Police quickly dropped the case for lack of evidence, but the district 
suspended Hopper for 15 days without pay. A state hearing official later ruled 
the suspension unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, the jury ordered Thompson to pay Hopper $50,000 in general damages 
and $5,000 in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure that even covers my expenses, (but) I feel this is a major 
victory," Hopper said after the verdict was handed down. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopper, now a special education teacher at Darby Elementary School in 
Northridge, filed a federal lawsuit under the False Claims Act in April, 1993. 
The district was defrauding the federal government, she alleged, by accepting 
about $20 million annually for special education programs but not following 
requirements that went along with that money. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge dismissed the main body of the suit in September, but ordered a trial 
on Hopper's other allegation -- that district officials retaliated against her 
for being a whistle-blower. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Thompson, now a principal at Virginia Road Elementary School in Los 
Angeles, was the only defendant singled out by the jury, Hopper and her 
attorney said the verdict was still an indictment of the district in general. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jurors I talked to said they wanted to send a message to the district," 
said James Fosbinder, Hopper's attorney. "We believe that this practice of 
retaliating against people who speak out is widespread in the district." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Friedman, assistant general counsel for the school district, viewed the 
verdict differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see it as a vindication of the district as an institution," he said. "But I 
feel somewhat frustrated . . . that an administrator, who I believe has acted 
in good faith, was held accountable by a jury." 
</P>
<P>
 His office will now study who should pay the $55,000 judgment -- the district 
or Thompson -- Friedman said, adding the district could still appeal the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 With one win in her pocket, Hopper promised Wednesday to appeal the dismissal 
of the remainder of her original suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am going to shape this district up, as far as special education is 
concerned," she said.

DEATH PENALTY SOUGHT FOR KILLERS OF OFFICER, MARKET OWNER; TRIAL: THE 
PROSECUTOR SAYS THEY 'WALLOWED IN GREED.' THE DEFENSE ASKS JURY FOR LIFE IN 
PRISON FOR THE CONVICTED MURDERERS OF OFFICER JOHN HOGLUND AND LEE CHUL KIM.

 Saying that they "wallowed in greed" and conjuring up images of their victims' 
bullet-riddled bodies, a prosecutor on Wednesday implored a jury to recommend 
the death penalty for the killers of a Maywood police officer and a Van Nuys 
market owner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would ask . . . that you show them the same compassion that they showed 
their victims," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Susan Speer, in the second and final 
day of closing arguments in the penalty phase of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 She presented her arguments to the same Los Angeles Superior Court jury that 
last month convicted Jose Contreras, Benjamin Alberto Navarro and Edgardo 
Sanchez Fuentes of first degree murder in the death of Officer John Hoglund, 
who was shot when he responded to a burglary alarm at a Maywood market on May 
29, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras and Fuentes were also convicted of killing Lee Chul Kim on May 4, 
1992, in the freezer of his Van Nuys grocery store after he returned from the 
bank with a large sum of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Speer ended her lengthy presentation by asking jurors "to find the courage and 
strength to do the right thing and impose the death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
 The men face the possibility of execution because jurors previously convicted 
them of several special circumstances, including killing a police officer and 
committing murder during the course of a robbery and to avoid arrest. Contreras 
and Fuentes were also convicted of an additional special circumstance of 
committing multiple murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys asked that instead of death, their clients be sentenced to 
life in prison without the possibility of parole. They argued that all three 
men had endured lives filled with poverty and hardship in their native Central 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 The men, all in their early 20s, sat quietly as attorneys fought over their 
fates, except for Contreras, who broke into tears as his lawyer implored the 
jury to spare his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Send Jose Contreras to prison where the good Lord will determine when he 
dies," attorney James Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard reminded jurors of previous testimony by a cultural anthropologist who 
traveled to Contreras' former home in Honduras and interviewed 50 people whose 
comments painted Contreras as a man with a "tremendous reputation." 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras was forced to start providing at age 8 for his mother and family, 
some of whom walked for miles in 100 degree temperatures to testify on his 
behalf, Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Speer raised the question of whether Contreras ever asked his mother if 
she wanted his "blood money" and contended that he sent her only a small 
portion of the money he stole during a string of robberies throughout the Los 
Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Contreras is looking out for himself first, last and always," Speer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor saved her harshest criticism for Sanchez Fuentes, who actually 
fired the shots in both killings. His lawyer appealed for his life on the 
grounds that he has found God since being caught and jailed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He may say he has Christ in his heart but he has Satan in his soul," Speer 
countered. 
</P>
<P>
 Speer discounted testimony given by several clergy on behalf of Sanchez 
Fuentes, arguing that they do not know the real Sanchez Fuentes, who she 
accused of lying throughout the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "He lied to the clergy, he lied to God and now he's lying to you," she told 
jurors. "He killed a store owner because he stood between him and money and he 
killed a police officer because he stood between him and freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 James Coady, a deputy public defender representing Sanchez Fuentes, 
acknowledged that his client killed both men, but asked jurors to put the case 
in perspective with all other murders, particularly ones he described as more 
heinous, before determining whether to impose death. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is the worst of the worst?" Coady asked. "What types of cases deserve 
the death penalty?" 
</P>
<P>
 Eric K. Davis, an attorney for Navarro, who was not charged in the Kim 
slaying, contended his client's life should be spared because he never killed 
or tortured anyone, but merely acted as a lookout during the robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 "He should be punished by spending the rest of his life in prison," Davis 
said. "Next to death it's the worst punishment possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Navarro, who was beaten by his father as a young boy and later sexually 
molested by an uncle, is not the vicious killer that prosecutors have made him 
out to be, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors will begin deliberating today. During the previous guilt phase of the 
trial, Fuentes and Contreras were each convicted on 38 counts -- including 
murder, robbery, assault with a deadly weapon and stun guns -- stemming from 
seven robberies. Navarro was found guilty of 32 counts for his role in five 
robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors alleged that during the robberies the defendants used 
electric-shock stun guns to torture restaurant and store employees into handing 
over money and threatened to cut off one woman's fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 "These were not Robin Hoods," Speer said. "They were stealing from everybody, 
including the poor, and keeping it for themselves."

 A 14-year-old Van Nuys Middle School student stabbed another 14-year-old 
student near the school Wednesday afternoon, and the victim was hospitalized in 
extremely critical condition, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the attacker ran up behind the victim as he walked home from 
school and stabbed him once in the leg at the intersection of Erwin Street and 
Cedros Avenue in Van Nuys, said Los Angeles Police Detective John Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
 The witnesses, some of them other students, recognized the attacker and told 
police his name, said Edwards. Police waited for him at his home where he 
walked up "with blood on him," said Edwards. The boy tried to flee, but was 
caught after a brief foot chase, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy later confessed to the stabbing, was arrested on suspicion of 
attempted murder and is being held at San Fernando Valley Juvenile Hall, 
Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, who police said was a gang member, underwent surgery at Valley 
Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys, where he was in critical condition because 
of extreme blood loss, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified School District spokesman Bill Rivera said additional 
police will patrol the school and the area around the Van Nuys campus today 
"just to make sure it doesn't escalate." 
</P>
<P>
 The district also will provide a crisis team of counselors, if the principal 
requests them, Rivera said.

MAN KILLS NEIGHBOR DURING BREAK-IN ATTEMPT

 A man shot and killed his next-door neighbor as the neighbor tried to break 
into his house Wednesday morning, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Theodore Baca, 49, told police that his neighbor Brian Hansen, 33, broke a 
window in Baca's front door about 9:50 a.m. and started to climb into Baca's 
home in the 18300 block of Sylvan Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Baca said he warned Hansen that he had a shotgun, and when Hansen kept trying 
to enter, Baca fired twice, killing him, said Detective Rick Swanston of the 
LAPD's West Valley Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hansen came to the house and demanded that Baca let him enter, when Baca 
refused and advised him he had a gun and would use it, Hansen just kept coming 
in," Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen was declared dead at the scene of wounds to the head and chest, 
Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baca told police that Hansen had threatened and beaten him two weeks ago after 
Baca said he would no longer cash checks for Hansen. Baca, an employee of the 
Department of Labor, had been cashing personal checks for Hansen for the past 
few weeks but some had bounced, Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Swanston said Baca was questioned and released. The investigation is 
continuing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think Ted would shoot him," said Margaret Hansen, Brian's mother, 
with whom he lived. "He knew who he was, he knew he didn't have a weapon."

COUPLE DIES IN MURDER-SUICIDE; CRIME: DURING AN ARGUMENT, DAVID DAVTYAN SHOOTS

 A husband fatally shot his wife during a quarrel in the bedroom of their 
apartment Wednesday, then committed suicide, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Davtyan 36, died instantly from the single gunshot to the head at the 
apartment in the 500 block of East Windsor Road.His wife, Vardush Davtyan, 37, 
died of a head wound an hour later at Glendale Memorial Hospital, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 David's mother, Perchuhy Davtyan, 63, said she was in another room of the 
apartment when she heard the two shots at about 2 p.m. She "knew they were 
engaged in serious discussion regarding their marital problems," said Lt. 
Raymond Edey of the Glendale Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 They were both shot with a .380-caliber semiautomatic pistol registered to 
David Davtyan that he bought in June, said Edey. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Wednesday, grieving relatives and friends gathered in a neighboring 
apartment unit, some in tears, and said they were shocked at the 
murder-suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Rima Ter-Galstanyan, 18, said she heard the dead man's mother scream, ran over 
to their apartment and called police. "She heard the shots but didn't know what 
they were," Ter-Galstanyan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's three children, ages 10 to 14, were at school at the time of the 
shootings and are staying with a nearby relative, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 David's father, Petros Davtyan, 84, sat quietly at the dinner table with his 
head down but would not speak. 
</P>
<P>
 Jiny Hwang, 17, lives with her parents in the apartment adjacent to the 
Davtyans. She said the argument before the shootings sounded like "someone was 
smashing furniture." 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew they had some kind of problem because they fought a lot," said Jiny, 
a friend of the couple's oldest child. "We could hear it through the walls."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; REWARDS OKD FOR STUDENT CRIME TIPS; HOT LINES: 
ANTELOPE VALLEY DISTRICT WILL GIVE $25 TO INFORMANTS REPORTING DRUGS OR WEAPONS 
AT HIGH SCHOOLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The trustees of the Antelope Valley Union High School District on Wednesday 
night approved a program that offers $25 rewards to high school students who 
tip off authorities to the identities of fellow students who bring weapons and 
illegal drugs to school. 
</P>
<P>
 The trustees endorsed the program 4 to 0, saying it will lead to a safer 
learning environment at the district's five four-year campuses and its 
continuation school. The trustees also promised to protect the identities of 
student informants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's well worth it and pays for itself," said board President Billy 
Pricer. "It gives the good students the ability to make some good moves 
comfortably and anonymously." 
</P>
<P>
 No objections were raised by other board members or by the public attending 
the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Many school districts, including Los Angeles Unified, have set up hot lines to 
collect tips on illegal activity on campus, but district-funded rewards for 
such information are much less common. 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley district, which has about 13,870 students, will pay the 
rewards from its general fund, which provides for teacher salaries and other 
daily operating expenses. Because this fund totals about $45 million for the 
current school year, district officials say offering the rewards will not 
require any program cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "At $25 apiece, if we had 100 of them over the year, it would probably not 
impact any particular budget," said Con Oamek, assistant superintendent for 
business services. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before setting up the reward, the district began publicizing a hot line 
number for tips on illegal activity on campus. Informants provide the tips to 
district administrators, who relay information to school principals or campus 
security officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Principals and administrators will be allowed to pay the rewards in cash, then 
obtain reimbursement from the school district. The principal or administrator 
will keep confidential records of the informants, and the students' names will 
not appear in the district's public checking account records, Oamek said. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials hope the program will help reduce drug usage and the carrying 
of weapons on campuses. If a weapon is found, the student who brought it to 
school must attend a hearing before an administrative panel that makes 
expulsion recommendations to the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last school year, 67 students were referred to this panel for 
possessing weapons, said Ray Monti, assistant superintendent for educational 
services. Three years ago, 83 students were referred for weapons violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Students caught selling or handing out drugs on campus are also referred to 
the review panel. A principal can take other disciplinary action if a student 
merely possesses a small amount of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Monti said the Antelope Valley district's "zero tolerance" program regarding 
drugs and weapons is patterned after a similar policy in the San Diego Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alex Rascon, director of police for San Diego Unified, said his district 
does not pay rewards for tips received on its 24-hour hot line. Even so, he 
said many students provide valuable information without expecting a financial 
payoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost 95% of the weapons we confiscate are reported by other kids," Rascon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 About two years ago, high schools in the Conejo Valley Unified School District 
in Ventura County began offering rewards, starting at $100, for campus crime 
tips. The money came from community donations, not district funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't particularly successful," said Richard Simpson, Conejo Valley's 
assistant superintendent for instruction services. "It required us to do our 
own fund raising to keep cash available. It also required a student to tell 
someone on campus, so the element of anonymity was missing." 
</P>
<P>
 Since last March, the district has instead encouraged students to call a hot 
line run by a nonprofit anti-crime organization that provides rewards of up to 
$1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson said Conejo Valley Unified also urges students to provide crime tips 
without seeking a reward. "It's our point of view that one of the things that 
needs to be taught in our schools is responsibility and citizenship," he said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; DEVELOPER REDESIGNS RECREATION CENTER; CANYON 
COUNTRY: PLANNING BOARD DELAYS ACTION ON PROPOSAL THAT, IN RESPONSE TO 
COMPLAINTS, NOW FOCUSES ON FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT INSTEAD OF TEEN-AGE ACTIVITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to fears about gangs, crime and noise, a developer has redesigned 
plans for a commercial recreation center in rural Canyon Country, emphasizing 
family entertainment over teen-age pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
 City planning commissioners, originally scheduled to review the Santa Clarita 
Family Recreation Center on Tuesday night, delayed action until Jan. 17 to give 
residents time to become familiar with the amended proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not what we saw at our last meeting," said Santa Clarita Planning 
Commission Chairman Pat Modugno. "It's not what the public has had the 
opportunity to see." 
</P>
<P>
 As originally planned by Royal Clark Development of Beverly Hills, the 
amusement park featured two 18-hole miniature golf courses, nine batting cages, 
four water slides, bumper boats, a motorized go-cart track, video games and a 
snack bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors of the 5.8-acre site on Oak Spring Canyon Road, southeast of the 
Antelope Valley Freeway, called the year-round recreation center a magnet for 
gangs, traffic, noise and other problems. They denounced it through 28 letters, 
a 95-signature petition and about 1,150 form letters submitted to the City 
Planning Department during the past two months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who the hell would plan an arcade in Canyon Country? Did the mob pay you guys 
off?" wrote resident Kurt Buehler. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am totally against this and if you pass it I will do everything in my power 
to get you fired or vote you out," Buehler wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion you people down there at City Hall think of Canyon Country as 
the ugly stepchild of Santa Clarita in comparison with projects you deem fit 
for Valencia," wrote resident Anne Frances Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see this park as one way of filling the coffers of the City Council at the 
expense of the Canyon Country residents." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the developers hope to quell such concerns by devoting the entire site to 
a water park and eliminating such traditional teen-age hangouts as a video 
arcade. 
</P>
<P>
 The water park would feature five slides, a wave pool, a children's pool and a 
slow-moving river. It would operate only part of the year and during daytime 
hours -- reducing its impact on the surrounding neighborhood even further. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, many of the more than 150 angry residents who attended Tuesday's 
session said they oppose any use of the property that will draw outsiders to 
Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you have a facility like this where you invite the public from the 
outside, you are asking for trouble," said Comet Way resident Pam Springer, 
predicting the park would draw "marauders from the San Fernando Valley and 
beyond."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; OPTIONAL UNIFORM POLICY CRITICIZED; EDUCATION: 
NEWHALL AND VALENCIA ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS FACE TIGHTER DRESS CODES. SKEPTICS SAY 
THE PROVISION IS POINTLESS IF IT IS NOT MADE MANDATORY. 
</P>

<P>
 Elementary schools in Newhall and Valencia have received permission to 
implement an optional student uniform policy, but some parents and school 
officials are questioning how effective the effort would be if regulated 
clothing is not mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newhall School District Board, which manages six elementary schools, voted 
unanimously Tuesday night to tighten existing dress codes, including banning 
T-shirt slogans promoting substance abuse and outlawing baggy pants such as 
those favored by gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's action also allows students to wear uniforms but does not require 
them -- a provision that critics say would undermine the benefits of having all 
students dress alike. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think having them voluntary would be ridiculous," said parent Elka Harms, 
whose 9-year-old son attends Valencia Valley Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to cause chaos," Harms said. "They should either do it mandatory 
or not do it at all." 
</P>
<P>
 School administrators said they would review the new policy but did not expect 
immediate changes in the way students dressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that it is policy it is something we will begin discussing," said Diane 
von Buelow, principal of Meadows Elementary School, adding she planned to 
solicit parents' and teachers' opinions on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey last spring showed that about three-fourths of parents living in the 
district supported a voluntary uniform policy, said Supt. J. Michael McGrath. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents said Wednesday that uniforms would help focus students' attention 
on learning rather than fashion and eliminate the dangers associated with 
gang-style clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think kids need to realize there's more to going to school than wearing the 
best tennis shoes," said parent Mary DeMonbrun, who has three children at 
Valencia Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But skeptics said a voluntary uniform program would be pointless since the 
problems associated with street clothes would still exist, and those wearing 
uniforms could be alienated. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at Valencia Valley had mixed reactions to the possibility of 
uniforms, but most said they would not want to wear them unless most of their 
classmates did so. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would feel funny, weird," said Eddie Gonzalez, 12, a sixth-grade student. 
"They could make fun of you." 
</P>
<P>
 Some board members said the policy could be a step toward implementing a 
mandatory uniform policy at one or more schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a school comes to us and expresses interest in a mandatory uniform policy, 
I think we should encourage them to pursue it," said Board President Gonzalo 
Freixes during Tuesday night's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Voluntary uniform policies have been implemented at dozens of Southern 
California schools. In Simi Valley, Assistant Principal Judy Cannings said she 
believes the policy that started this year at her campus has been successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the advantages are that the students here do their work and are not 
as fashion conscious as they normally would be," said Cannings, who works at 
Garden Grove Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the program began, as much as 70% of the school's students have been 
wearing uniforms although the number of participants tapers off by the week's 
end, Cannings said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it has something to do with laundry," she said. "I have several 
students who come in and tell me part of their uniform is dirty." 
</P>
<P>
 The only uniform program currently in effect in Santa Clarita is an 
experimental, one-year mandatory policy at La Mesa Junior High School. Freixes, 
the Newhall board president, said a voluntary uniform program at the elementary 
level could prepare students for mandatory uniforms in junior high and high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Uniform policies at some of the state's schools have prompted lawsuits by the 
American Civil Liberties Union and other groups that say they restrict 
students' freedom of expression. McGrath, Newhall's superintendent, said the 
voluntary uniform policy is easier to defend legally. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, McGrath said, schools with mandatory uniform policies are 
required by law to allow parents who object to transfer their children to a 
different school. 
</P>
<P>
 "My view of the mandatory program is, you're still put in the position of it's 
something you can't force kids to wear," he said.

PARTS OF PROP. 187 BLOCKED BY JUDGE; IMMIGRATION: TEMPORARY ORDER TARGETS 
MEDICAL, EDUCATIONAL AND SOCIAL SERVICES. JURIST SAYS MEASURE MAY CONFLICT WITH 
FEDERAL LAWS AND U.S. CONSTITUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Saying that portions of Proposition 187 may conflict with federal statutes and 
the U.S. Constitution, a federal district judge in Los Angeles issued a 
temporary restraining order Wednesday blocking immediate enforcement of the 
sweeping initiative's bans on non-emergency medical, educational and social 
services for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Dist. Judge Matthew Byrne Jr. also ordered a temporary halt to the 
initiative's requirement that police and government agencies report suspected 
illegal immigrants to the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service and 
the state attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballot measure, which was approved by an overwhelming 59%-41% margin in 
last week's state election, raises "serious questions" as to whether 
immigrants' constitutional right to due process would be impeded because the 
measure does not provide for hearings before or after people are denied 
government services, Byrne said at the conclusion of a dramatic two-hour 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that the get-tough ballot measure's bans on health and social 
services may conflict with federal laws that specify who is eligible for such 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne, who set another hearing before U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer 
for Tuesday, left intact only the initiative's sections increasing state 
penalties for the sale and use of fraudulent citizenship documents. 
</P>
<P>
 At next week's status conference hearing, Pfaelzer will finalize the date for 
a hearing on requests by Proposition 187 foes for a preliminary injunction, 
designed to block implementation of the initiative until its legality is 
determined in extended court hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne's ruling will block implementation of the law for only a few days -- and 
will have little direct impact because most portions of the initiative were not 
due to take effect until state agencies finished preparing enforcement 
regulations in coming weeks. Nevertheless, it was hailed by Proposition 187 
opponents as a major victory and by state Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren as a 
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a terrific day for California," said Mark D. Rosenbaum, legal 
director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, which 
along with several other civil rights groups filed one of four lawsuits against 
the initiative that Byrne heard jointly Wednesday. "There's a long fight in 
front of us, but we couldn't be starting any better -- they're on the ropes 
already." 
</P>
<P>
 "While the issuance of a temporary restraining order is not entirely 
unexpected, it is disappointing," Lungren said later. "By delaying the state's 
mandate to implement this new law, the court is also denying the will of 
California voters who specifically rejected the status quo on Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nevertheless, my office will continue to press for a resolution as quickly as 
possible so that the law can be enforced." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Prince, the Tustin accountant who headed the pro-187 campaign committee, 
said the performance of Lungren's lawyers in court made him wonder if they were 
adequately prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd have to question whether they've even read the initiative," said Prince, 
who viewed the proceedings in the packed Downtown Los Angeles courtroom. "(But) 
this isn't going to be on ice forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Yorba Linda political consultant Robert Kiley, who helped spearhead the 187 
campaign, said, "I'm angry. This is a mandate and we are dealing with liberal 
judges appointed by previous administrations. Their job is to interpret the 
law, not thwart the will of the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Ezell, a former INS commissioner who co-authored the initiative, 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the typical thing," said the Newport Beach businessman. "They found a 
liberal judge and then they got him to buy into their stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Both men said they regarded Wednesday's court action as only a temporary 
setback. Eventually, they maintained, the judicial system will validate the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "From day one, we knew to win this thing we'd probably have to go all the way 
to the Supreme Court," Ezell said. "The bottom line is that we'll prevail 
because it's right." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Orange County health officials were delighted by Wednesday's 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am enormously relieved on behalf of all the families we serve," said Margot 
Hughes-Lopez, executive director of the nonprofit South County Community Clinic 
in San Juan Capistrano, where the patient population is about 60% Latino. "The 
only question we have to ask when they come in the door is, 'How may we help 
you?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic, like many others in the county, depends in part on state and 
county funding and "cannot violate the laws," Hughes-Lopez said. The judge's 
order "allows us to continue to deliver services as we always have." 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes-Lopez said the number of patients seeking care at her clinic and others 
in the county has dropped since the initiative passed, possibly because people 
fear being questioned about their immigration status. She hopes the judge's 
ruling will quell those fears. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably are going to see people a little less frightened to come in," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Hugh Stallworth, Orange County's director for public health, also welcomed 
the judge's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "My understanding is that (it means) we're doing business as usual," he said. 
"It's excellent news for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Stallworth and other health officials had expressed concern throughout the 
campaign that the measure would keep illegal immigrants from seeking care 
essential to prevent costly emergencies and the spread of contagious disease. 
</P>
<P>
 State Assistant Atty. Gen. Charlton Holland, one of two lawyers from the 
attorney general's office to speak during the court session, had no immediate 
reaction after the ruling. But Holland did tell the judge that his office 
stands ready to extend the temporary restraining order until mid-December to 
allow more time for legal briefs to be prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight separate lawsuits have been filed in state and federal courts in Los 
Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento to thwart implementation of Proposition 
187 since its passage. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning after the election, San Francisco Superior Court Judge Stuart R. 
Pollak issued a temporary restraining order against the initiative's bans on 
public school, college and university enrollment for illegal immigrants, saying 
the strictures could not be put in place before further court hearings. The 
challenge to the school ban was brought by the Los Angeles and San Francisco 
Unified school districts and the California School Boards Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne's restraining order also covers the educational provisions of 
Proposition 187, based on lawsuits filed on behalf of schoolchildren by the Los 
Angeles-based Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law and attorneys 
Stephen Yagman and Fred Kumetz. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth lawsuit before Byrne on Wednesday, filed by the ACLU and a coalition 
of civil rights groups, charges that the sweeping ballot measure unlawfully 
intrudes on federal jurisdiction over immigration and denies constitutional 
rights by terminating benefits without legal hearings and by encouraging 
discrimination against people who look or sound foreign. 
</P>
<P>
 In its court papers, the ACLU filed sworn declarations from more than 120 
doctors, educators, immigration experts and illegal immigrants attacking 
Proposition 187 on a variety of grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 During Wednesday's hearing, much of the legal debate centered around whether 
either side would suffer hardship if the initiative was temporarily enjoined. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenbaum contended that because of ambiguous statements by state officials 
including Gov. Pete Wilson since last week's election, many illegal immigrants 
have been scared to keep appointments at public health clinics for fear that 
they would be reported to immigration authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys representing the state were less expansive. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked what hardship the state would suffer if a restraining order were 
issued, Deputy Atty. Gen. Jon Ichinaga replied: "The state is harmed because 
nearly 60% of the state's voters voted for this measure." 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne dismissed the argument as having no legal bearing. "What case in the 
world has ever said that?" he asked Ichinaga. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, when asked by the judge what harm the restraining order would have on 
such provisions as the requirement for police officers to determine the 
immigration status of arrestees, Ichinaga said he could cite no specific harm. 
</P>
<P>
 The court hearing also touched upon specific impacts of the ballot measure. At 
times, Byrne made pointed comments about its apparent legal deficiencies. 
Noting that Proposition 187 contains several different definitions for illegal 
immigrants, he said "it looks as if it's been drafted by committee." 
</P>
<P>
 In court Wednesday, Lungren's lawyers told the judge that a restraining order 
was unnecessary because state agencies have not prepared regulations to 
implement the measure. Moreover, they said, the regulations would be drafted to 
avoid any constitutional pitfalls that a strict reading of the ballot measure 
could raise. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne said he could not take into account any unformulated regulations because 
that would require speculation. His decision, Byrne said, had to be based 
strictly on the ballot initiative as written. 
</P>
<P>
 After the hearing, Rosenbaum said the state's plans to draft regulations that 
clear up unconstitutional portions should not be allowed by the courts. "It's 
like giving a face lift to Frankenstein to turn it into Mother Teresa." 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing also saw a split between lawyers for the various groups 
challenging the ballot measure. Yagman and Kumetz told Byrne they want a 
hearing Wednesday before Pfaelzer on a preliminary injunction. Rosenbaum and 
Peter Schey of the constitutional law center said they agree with the state 
that the restraining order could stand until mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
 The rash of lawsuits filed or contemplated by the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, the Los Angeles City Council and other governmental bodies statewide 
has drawn an angry response from proponents of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly a week of largely negative phone calls, the City Council on 
Wednesday prepared to drop an outright challenge of the law in favor of merely 
asking the courts to clarify how it should be applied by city departments. 
</P>
<P>
 The council had voted 10 to 3 last week to join lawsuits opposing Proposition 
187. Councilman Joel Wachs, who opposed that position, said Wednesday that he 
has lined up enough votes now so that the council will merely ask the courts 
for clarification. 
</P>
<P>
 After a bitter discussion of the issue, an immediate vote was headed off when 
council members Mike Hernandez, Richard Alarcon and Ruth Galanter broke a 
quorum by walking out of the meeting.

UCI STUDY FINDS LIGHT SENTENCES FOR THRIFT FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Those convicted of defrauding the nation's savings and loans receive prison 
terms far shorter than those imposed on the average burglar, according to a UC 
Irvine study released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, more than a fifth of the S&L fraud perpetrators have gone without 
jail time, according to the three-year study by two UCI professors and a 
professor at St. John's University in New York. Thrift fraud caused an industry 
debacle that could cost taxpayers $500 billion over time. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County, especially, is the nation's thrift fraud capital and 
"California's S&L hell," UCI criminology professor Henry N. Pontell said in an 
interview. Pontell headed the $240,000 study funded by the Justice Department's 
National Institute of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1985, there have been 27 thrifts based in Orange County that failed -- 
more S&Ls than in any other California county. The nation's two costliest 
failures -- American Savings & Loan and Lincoln Savings & Loan -- were based in 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the white-collar fraud capital of the United States, as far as I'm 
concerned," Pontell said. "It's not what you see in the streets but what you 
don't see that is killing people, especially the elderly who are often preyed 
upon most by con artists." 
</P>
<P>
 The UCI study, called "Fraud in the Savings and Loan Industry: White-Collar 
Crime and Government Response," found that 78% of 580 people sentenced for 
thrift fraud were sent to prison, but only 4% were given terms of 10 years or 
more and only 13% of those sentenced received at least five years behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 The median sentence was less than two years, according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
 Losses from the nation's thrift debacle of the 1980s range from $160 billion 
to $180 billion, Pontell said, but taxpayers will end up spending at least $500 
billion over more than 20 years to cover those losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial scams by high-level insiders and such outsiders as major borrowers 
and consultants account for at least 25% of the total loss, according to the 
study by Pontell and colleagues Kitty Calavita, a UCI associate professor of 
criminology, and Robert Tillman, an assistant professor of sociology at St. 
John's. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County has been such a hotbed of criminal fraud activity, Pontell said, 
because of its very character. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County has extreme wealth and flagrantly displays it," he said. "The 
proportion of people with Porsches, for instance, is probably the largest in 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Such affluence and basic opulence, he said, marks the county as a place where 
life is lived in the fast lane -- a place that attracts many people who want to 
get rich quick by any means. 
</P>
<P>
 "S&L fraud was endemic throughout the country, but it was part of the ecology, 
part of the environment here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But those convicted of thrift fraud received less punishment than other 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, for example, the average prison term for those convicted of major 
thrift crime was 36.4 months, while the average burglar was given 55.6 months 
in prison and the average car thief was sentenced to 38 months, Pontell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The thrift cases that year accounted for losses of more than $8 billion, but 
judges meted out fines and restitution of less than $348 million, and only a 
fraction of that was collected, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 While sentences for S&L defrauders has been light in general, those convicted 
in serious cases where losses were high have generally received much tougher 
sentences, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Lincoln case, the nation's most notorious S&L failure, thrift operator 
Charles H. Keating Jr. was sentenced to 10 years in prison on his state 
securities fraud conviction and to 12 years, seven months on his federal 
racketeering, conspiracy and fraud convictions. He is in prison while he 
appeals his federal conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1987 failure of North America Savings & Loan in Santa Ana -- a thrift 
that regulators say was set up as a criminal scheme -- Janet Faye McKinzie 
became the first industry executive to be convicted of federal racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
 The thrift consultant, who ran the operation with owner Duayne (Doc) 
Christensen, was sentenced to 20 years in prison but was released six months 
ago after serving barely four years. Even prosecutors commended McKinzie for 
being a model prisoner who helped others while serving her sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminals considered the federally insured funds at thrifts as "other people's 
money" and treated it so recklessly that there was little doubt they intended 
to defraud the institutions, said Ronald Rus, an Irvine lawyer who helped small 
investors in Lincoln's parent company -- mostly elderly Southern Californians 
-- recover much of their $285-million loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that law enforcement has got to the point where it decided to make 
streets safe -- so the elderly can go begging," he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 In their study, Pontell and his colleagues also dissected so-called criminal 
referrals, which are requests by regulators for FBI investigations into 
suspected criminal activities mainly by thrift insiders. They counted and 
matched names listed in the referrals, for instance, to see whose names came up 
repeatedly and what happened to them. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, they determined, just one in four people "referred" by 
regulators for criminal investigation was prosecuted. In Texas, where most 
referrals were made, only one in seven was prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Pontell said, about 30% of those indicted were people -- 
mainly borrowers and other outsiders -- never listed by regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for the apparent lack of action against insiders, Pontell believes, 
is that prosecuting borrowers and other outsiders is easier than pursuing the 
often complex white-collar crimes of thrift executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Borrowers leave a trail of false documents, he said, while insiders can shield 
their actions by claiming they simply used poor business judgment. What 
investigators often find, he said, are records so poorly documented that the 
loans are essentially fraudulent. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, he said, the "sheer volume and magnitude of fraud cases limits the 
ability of the government to sanction violators." Failed S&Ls 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1985, 27 savings and loan associations have failed in Orange County, 
which a UCI professor who studied thrift fraud calls "California's S&L hell."

ABSENTEE BALLOT COUNT ALTERS 3 O.C. ELECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three city council candidates in Buena Park, Newport Beach and Santa Ana fell 
from council members-elect to possible losers Wednesday after 48,000 absentee 
ballots from the Nov. 8 election were counted. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking like photo-finish winners on election night, candidates Larry T. Wieck 
in Buena Park, Ron Winship in Newport Beach and Alberta Christy in Santa Ana 
found Wednesday that they had been overtaken by their nearest rivals when the 
absentee ballots were counted. 
</P>
<P>
 But with 5,500 so-called provisional ballots still to be reviewed for 
validity, the results are not final, and no one in these tight races is ready 
to concede defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in other election results: 
</P>
<P>
 * Orange County Municipal Judge Dan C. Dutcher conceded the election to 
Assistant Dist. Atty. Caryl Lee, who was leading by less than 1% after 
Wednesday's tally. 
</P>
<P>
 * There was no significant change in the outcome of the vote for Measure A, 
the controversial initiative that requires a commercial airport at El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station. Those favoring the airport made up 51.2% of the votes 
cast. 
</P>
<P>
 None of Wednesday's front-runners appeared more jubilant than Buena Park 
Councilman Arthur C. Brown, who moved ahead of Wieck, a city planning 
commissioner, by only 10 votes. The usually reserved Brown danced a goal-line 
jig in the lobby of City Hall when he heard that he had pulled ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's going to change," he said of his 10-vote lead. "I came out 
ahead of (Wieck) in the first count of absentee ballots." 
</P>
<P>
 Wieck, who plans to wait until every ballot is tallied before deciding whether 
to seek a recount, said, "Boy, I'll tell you, it's been back and forth; it's 
been an emotional roller coaster. You work hard all through your campaign to 
win, and for the registrar not to be able to come up with the results is as 
frustrating as it can be." 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Tanney, the county registrar of voters, said that once the vote count 
is certified -- probably next Monday -- candidates have until Nov. 28 to submit 
written requests for recounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanney said the provisional ballots still being checked are from throughout 
the county, so he does not know if the lead in the three council races could 
switch again. 
</P>
<P>
 "History says of the provisional ballots that a lot of them will not be 
counted because the people were not registered or there was some kind of 
problem there," Tanney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Provisional ballots can include those cast by voters who requested absentee 
ballots but instead went to the polling places on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the only nail-biting race decided by Wednesday's absentee vote count 
was the caustic match-up between Dutcher, a 12-year member of the bench, and 
prosecutor Lee. Dutcher sued Lee for libel during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 With the absentee vote count showing Dutcher eight-tenths of a percentage 
point behind Lee -- a 1,149-vote margin -- an embittered Dutcher conceded the 
election. He contended that the campaign methods employed by Lee and her 
campaign manager cost them the respect of the legal community, which backed his 
reelection bid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't envy them from two standpoints, either in the way they achieved 
(victory) or what life is going to be like from now on in the legal community," 
Dutcher said. "There's just universal opprobrium not only in our court, but 
throughout the courts in the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, who has denied Dutcher's charges that she lied about his record, said: " 
'All's well that ends well' is the saying that fits how I feel. . . . I plan to 
act professionally, and I expect everyone else will too." 
</P>
<P>
 Dutcher's defeat was the fourth in the last 16 suffered by a sitting Orange 
County judge, according to judicial officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Defeat also may not be easy for those who appeared to be leading in the three 
council races prior to Wednesday's absentee ballot count. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few days ago, Christy had said all she wanted was to "hear the fat lady 
sing" as a sign that she had survived the ongoing ballot count for the Santa 
Ana council seat. Instead, all she heard on Wednesday was a mean tune that 
soured her chances of taking a seat on the council. Her 150-vote election night 
lead fell to a 223-vote deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's just wait till it's over with," she said, refusing to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
 The new front-runner, Santa Ana Planning Commissioner Tony Espinoza, was 
hopeful but hesitant to declare victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad the trend changed, but it might change again," Espinoza said. "I 
really won't feel any emotions as far as whether I won or lost -- I won't be 
able to feel anything until Monday." 
</P>
<P>
 A Christy loss would be a setback for the city's political Establishment, 
including the police and firefighters' associations and the Santa Ana Chamber 
of Commerce, which had backed her third try at a council seat. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposite may be true in Newport Beach, where Winship's fall from the lead 
could cause a collective sigh of relief from the city's business community. 
</P>
<P>
 Winship, a public relations consultant and part-time waiter, was the only 
council candidate to oppose a commercial airport at El Toro. Edwards, a member 
of the city Planning Commission, has aggressively campaigned for the airport 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates said there is nothing they can do but sit and wait for the 
vote count to end. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty-six votes separated us (on election night)," said Edwards, who pulled 
ahead by 180 votes. "There's nothing you can do. The die is cast and you have 
to sit there and see what happens. I hope this is final." 
</P>
<P>
 Like others who saw their leads evaporate, Winship said he would not concede 
until all the votes were counted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything in this race has been unexpected," he said. "Nothing has surprised 
me yet. I'm disappointed that we initially pulled ahead in the initial absentee 
ballots and I hoped that would continue. . . . It's a real lottery right now." 
</P>
<P>
 In Buena Park, Wieck seemed to have won the seat by 34 votes -- until 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not conceding and I am waiting until all the avenues have been checked 
out," he said, adding that he was too emotionally torn up at this point to say 
whether he would demand a recount now that he was 10 votes behind Brown, the 
incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, meanwhile, said Wieck could demand a recount if he wants one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let him pay for it," Brown said.

L.A. FIRE CHIEF DISPUTES AUDIT'S CLAIMS OF BIAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. LOPEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Facing criticism from inside and outside his department, Los Angeles Fire 
Chief Donald O. Manning and his supporters rallied Wednesday in defense of the 
department's affirmative action policies before a skeptical City Council 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning was called before the Personnel Committee to respond to a blistering 
city audit finding that white males dominate the department's top posts and 
that women and minorities have been subjected to sexual and racial harassment 
at "rookie kill stations," where efforts are made to force them out of the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief disputed the audit's findings, telling council members that the 
department works hard to diversify its work force and takes quick action 
against racism and sexism. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it comes to our attention, we swiftly deal with it," Manning said, as 
about 75 members of the Fire Department -- decked out in crisp, dark blue 
uniforms -- surrounded him in the council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to the audit's findings is one of the sharpest challenges Manning 
has faced since his appointment to the department's top post in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, the 62-year-old chief is confronted with a no-win situation. Not 
only is he facing increased scrutiny by the City Council, he is being sharply 
criticized by some members of his own department, who feel he has lowered 
hiring standards to bring in women and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 An opinion poll conducted by the 3,000-member firefighters union found that 
the membership had "an overwhelming lack of confidence" in Manning because of 
the department's affirmative action policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are being condemned on both sides of that issue," Manning said in an 
interview Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was no lack of support for the chief among those firefighters at 
Wednesday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The department has been nothing but supportive of me," Kory Clark, a female 
fire inspector and seven-year department veteran, told the committee. Like 
others who testified in support of the chief, Clark said she had neither seen 
nor heard of harassment or discrimination in the department, which has 3,100 
uniformed personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 An incredulous Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg said she had a hard time believing 
that harassment and discrimination do not exist: "You can't spend all your time 
denying a problem exists. The reality is not everyone is having a positive 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 The union poll conducted last spring by the United Firefighters of Los Angeles 
City found that the main reason for the lack of confidence in Manning is that 
firefighters believe he has lowered standards to hire women and minorities, 
said Capt. John Squire, who chaired a committee authorized by the chief to 
prepare a report prioritizing the poll's findings. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are people we have to work with side by side, and we know they can't do 
the job," Squire said Wednesday of some minorities and women. 
</P>
<P>
 The report prepared by Squire's committee, which included 21 department 
members, also said the chief "does not accept dissenting opinions. He has 
surrounded himself with people who are afraid to disagree." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who speak out, the report said, are met with retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't agree with the chief engineer and his policies, your head is on 
the chopping block," said Squire, who estimated that about a third of the 
union's members participated in the poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning vehemently denied that he retaliates against employees or that hiring 
standards have been lowered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I absolutely disagree with that," said Manning, who questioned whether the 
poll's findings accurately represent department-wide sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the poll's methodology nor the number of firefighters who participated 
was discussed in the department summary. Union officials were at a conference 
in New Orleans on Wednesday and unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 After the poll's findings were released, Manning took them seriously enough to 
authorize the formation of the committee, which issued its report in September 
and will work with the chief to address the concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the union's findings, such as charges of "nepotism" and "cronyism," 
were similar to those in the city's audit of the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "There must be a concerted effort on the part of Fire Department management to 
dispel the perception and incidence of nepotism, cronyism, differential 
application of discipline, differential treatment of women and minorities and a 
'good old boy' syndrome," the 300-page audit stated. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit was conducted by the Personnel Department at the request of 
Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who said he had received numerous discrimination 
complaints from minority and women firefighters who said their promotional 
opportunities were limited. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the top 20 Fire Department officials and administrators, 95% are white men, 
and there are no Asian Americans, women or blacks, the audit found. Minority 
representation in those ranks is less than it was in 1990, when white men held 
89% of the chief, deputy chief and assistant chief slots, according to the 
audit. 
</P>
<P>
 "A great deal of work remains to be done by the Fire Department, not only to 
create a work force which reflects the community it serves, but to establish 
and maintain a healthy, positive working environment which encourages success 
for all its members," the audit stated. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings were based on an analysis of department hiring practices and 
interviews with 84 current and former firefighters. Manning said the 
firefighters represented a scant 2% of the department and offered a skewed 
view. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning presented the council with a proposal for a $2 million department 
reorganization that would create a human resources bureau to study ways of 
improving retention rates for women and minorities and improve tracking of 
discrimination complaints. During the hearing, firefighters told committee 
members they have never had problems with the department's promotions process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never experienced anyone in the department blocking my way," said 
Battalion Chief Rick Garcia, an 18-year veteran and one of the highest-ranking 
Latinos in the department. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit's findings were first reported Saturday in The Times. Many 
firefighters at the hearing criticized The Times' report, saying it gave the 
department an undeserved negative reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Commission President Elizabeth Lowe told council members that she was 
concerned because the audit said the department has not abided by a 
court-ordered hiring plan requiring that at least half of all new annual hires 
be minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowe, who said that conclusion contradicts Fire Department data, has asked Los 
Angeles attorney Gilbert T. Ray to conduct anindependent investigation of the 
department's affirmative action programs. Ray was the executive director of the 
Christopher Commission, which studied practices and policies in the Los Angeles 
Police Department, and has agreed to Lowe's request. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members told Lowe, who had not read the audit, that she had 
misinterpreted its findings. The audit's criticism of the court-ordered hiring 
plan was directed at the Personnel Department, not the Fire Department, council 
members said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Commissioner Leslie Song Winner said she was concerned because Lowe had 
requested the independent investigation without consulting the commission. "I 
believe that it is inappropriate at this time," Winner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowe said she will ask for the commission's support at its meeting Tuesday.

PARTS OF PROP. 187 BLOCKED BY JUDGE; IMMIGRATION: TEMPORARY ORDER TARGETS 
MEDICAL, EDUCATIONAL AND SOCIAL SERVICES. JURIST SAYS MEASURE MAY CONFLICT WITH 
FEDERAL LAWS AND U.S. CONSTITUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Saying that portions of Proposition 187 may conflict with federal statutes and 
the U.S. Constitution, a federal district judge in Los Angeles issued a 
temporary restraining order Wednesday blocking immediate enforcement of the 
sweeping initiative's bans on non-emergency medical, educational and social 
services for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Dist. Judge Matthew Byrne Jr. also ordered a temporary halt to the 
initiative's requirement that police and government agencies report suspected 
illegal immigrants to the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service and 
the state attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballot measure, which was approved by an overwhelming 59%-41% margin in 
last week's state election, raises "serious questions" as to whether 
immigrants' constitutional right to due process would be impeded because the 
measure does not provide for hearings before or after people are denied 
government services, Byrne said at the conclusion of a dramatic two-hour 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that the get-tough ballot measure's bans on health and social 
services may conflict with federal laws that specify who is eligible for such 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne, who set another hearing before U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer 
for Tuesday, left intact only the initiative's sections increasing state 
penalties for the sale and use of fraudulent citizenship documents. 
</P>
<P>
 At next week's status conference hearing, Pfaelzer will finalize the date for 
a hearing on requests by Proposition 187 foes for a preliminary injunction, 
designed to block implementation of the initiative until its legality is 
determined in extended court hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a backlash against public officials who have tried to block 
Proposition 187 in court gained steam Wednesday -- forcing the Los Angeles City 
Council to reconsider its stand against the measure and leading a citizens 
group to launch a campaign to recall the president of the Los Angeles school 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne's ruling will block implementation of the law for only a few days -- and 
will have little direct impact because most portions of the initiative were not 
due to take effect until state agencies finished preparing enforcement 
regulations in coming weeks. Nevertheless, it was hailed by Proposition 187 
opponents as a major victory and by state Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren as a 
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a terrific day for California," said Mark D. Rosenbaum, legal 
director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, which, 
along with several other civil rights groups, filed one of four lawsuits 
against the initiative that Byrne heard jointly Wednesday. "There's a long 
fight in front of us, but we couldn't be starting any better -- they're on the 
ropes already." 
</P>
<P>
 "While the issuance of a temporary restraining order is not entirely 
unexpected, it is disappointing," Lungren said later. "By delaying the state's 
mandate to implement this new law, the court is also denying the will of 
California voters who specifically rejected the status quo on Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nevertheless, my office will continue to press for a resolution as quickly as 
possible so that the law can be enforced." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Prince, who headed the pro-187 campaign committee, said the performance of 
Lungren's lawyers in court made him wonder if they were adequately prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd have to question whether they've even read the initiative," said Prince, 
who viewed the proceedings in the packed Downtown Los Angeles courtroom. "(But) 
this isn't going to be on ice forever." 
</P>
<P>
 State Assistant Atty. Gen. Charlton Holland, one of two lawyers from the 
attorney general's office to speak during the court session, had no immediate 
reaction after the ruling. But Holland did tell the judge that his office 
stands ready to extend the temporary restraining order until mid-December to 
allow more time for legal briefs to be prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight separate lawsuits have been filed in state and federal courts in Los 
Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento to thwart implementation of Proposition 
187 since its passage. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning after the election, San Francisco Superior Court Judge Stuart R. 
Pollak issued a temporary restraining order against the initiative's bans on 
public school, college and university enrollment for illegal immigrants, saying 
the strictures could not be put in place before further court hearings. The 
challenge to the school ban was brought by the Los Angeles and San Francisco 
Unified school districts and the California School Boards Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne's restraining order also covers the educational provisions of 
Proposition 187, based on lawsuits filed on behalf of schoolchildren by the Los 
Angeles-based Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law and attorneys 
Stephen Yagman and Fred Kumetz. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth lawsuit before Byrne on Wednesday, filed by the ACLU and a coalition 
of civil rights groups, charges that the sweeping ballot measure unlawfully 
intrudes on federal jurisdiction over immigration and denies constitutional 
rights by terminating benefits without legal hearings and by encouraging 
discrimination against people who look or sound foreign. 
</P>
<P>
 In its court papers, the ACLU filed sworn declarations from more than 120 
doctors, educators, immigration experts and illegal immigrants attacking 
Proposition 187 on a variety of grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 During Wednesday's hearing, much of the legal debate centered around whether 
either side would suffer hardship if the initiative was temporarily enjoined. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenbaum contended that because of ambiguous statements by state officials 
including Gov. Pete Wilson since last week's election, many illegal immigrants 
have been scared to keep appointments at public health clinics for fear that 
they would be reported to immigration authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys representing the state were less expansive. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked what hardship the state would suffer if a restraining order were 
issued, Deputy Atty. Gen. Jon Ichinaga replied: "The state is harmed because 
nearly 60% of the state's voters voted for this measure." 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne dismissed the argument as having no legal bearing. "What case in the 
world has ever said that?" he asked Ichinaga. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, when asked by the judge what harm the restraining order would have on 
such provisions as the requirement for police officers to determine the 
immigration status of arrestees, Ichinaga said he could cite no specific harm. 
</P>
<P>
 The court hearing also touched upon specific impacts of the ballot measure. At 
times, Byrne made pointed comments about its apparent legal deficiencies. 
Noting that Proposition 187 contains several different definitions for illegal 
immigrants, he said "it looks as if it's been drafted by committee." 
</P>
<P>
 In court Wednesday, Lungren's lawyers told the judge that a restraining order 
was unnecessary because state agencies have not prepared regulations to 
implement the measure. Moreover, they said, the regulations would be drafted to 
avoid any constitutional pitfalls that a strict reading of the ballot measure 
could raise. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne said he could not take into account any unformulated regulations because 
that would require speculation. His decision, Byrne said, had to be based 
strictly on the ballot initiative as written. 
</P>
<P>
 After the hearing, Rosenbaum said the state's plans to draft regulations that 
clear up unconstitutional portions should not be allowed by the courts. "It's 
like giving a face lift to Frankenstein to turn it into Mother Teresa." 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing also saw a split between lawyers for the various groups 
challenging the ballot measure. Yagman and Kumetz told Byrne they want a 
hearing Wednesday before Pfaelzer on a preliminary injunction. Rosenbaum and 
Peter Schey of the constitutional law center said they agree with the state 
that the restraining order could stand until mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
 The rash of lawsuits filed or contemplated by the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, the Los Angeles City Council and other governmental bodies statewide 
has drawn an angry response from proponents of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly a week of largely negative phone calls, the City Council on 
Wednesday prepared to drop an outright challenge of the law in favor of merely 
asking the courts to clarify how it should be applied by city departments. 
</P>
<P>
 The council had voted 10 to 3 last week to join lawsuits opposing Proposition 
187. Councilman Joel Wachs, who opposed that position, said Wednesday that he 
has lined up enough votes now so that the council will merely ask the courts 
for clarification. 
</P>
<P>
 After a bitter discussion of the issue, an immediate vote was headed off when 
council members Mike Hernandez, Richard Alarcon and Ruth Galanter broke a 
quorum by walking out of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter if you walk out now," Wachs told his colleagues. "This 
issue will be back before us Friday and the meeting after that and the meeting 
after that until we decide it." 
</P>
<P>
 A Galanter aide said later that she had to leave City Hall to attend a meeting 
in her district. Hernandez and Alarcon said they walked out because the 
council's discussion was a "meaningless" attempt by some members to find 
political cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the politically charged discussion may not have a practical effect 
on how City Atty. James K. Hahn pursues the Proposition 187 issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachs' motion calls on the city attorney to take "whatever steps are 
necessary" to clarify the city's responsibilities under the measure. But Hahn 
said Wednesday that the only way his office can obtain such clarification is to 
join a lawsuit and challenge the constitutionality of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn said no other party to the lawsuit "will ask the kinds of questions we 
will" -- about whether the proposition bans illegal immigrants from public 
pools, crime victims' assistance programs, child care at city parks and other 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Los Angeles Unified School District headquarters, several key sponsors 
of Proposition 187 announced plans to launch a recall petition drive against 
Mark Slavkin, president of the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only did this board openly defy the people, they used the people's money 
to do so," said Glenn Spencer, president of the Voice of Citizens Together, a 
Sherman Oaks-based anti-illegal immigration group that worked for the measure's 
passage. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavkin defended the district's participation in the lawsuit as an attempt to 
protect and clarify constitutional issues, which otherwise could result in the 
loss of up to $628 million in federal funds. The district's share of the 
lawsuit, he said, will be only "a few hundred thousand dollars."

MOORE ADMITS GUILT IN COMPTON EXTORTION CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Compton City Councilwoman Patricia Moore, who gained national 
prominence as an outspoken advocate of African American issues, has pleaded 
guilty to extortion and failing to file an income tax return, federal 
prosecutors said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, 46, a key figure in a federal probe of political corruption in Compton, 
pleaded guilty to a single count of extorting $9,100 in November, 1991, from a 
representative of a company that wanted to build a state-of-the-art trash 
incinerator in the southeast Los Angeles County city, Assistant U. S. Atty. 
John M. Potter said. 
</P>
<P>
 The extortion count, a felony, carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison 
and a $250,000 fine. Moore's plea to failing to file a federal tax return in 
1992 is a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail and a $25,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore is the second former Compton official to either be indicted or admit 
wrongdoing as part of the five-year federal probe. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressman Walter R. Tucker III (D-Compton) was indicted in August on charges 
that he solicited and accepted bribes from a businessman who had promoted the 
incinerator project and hid the money from the Internal Revenue Service while 
serving as Compton's mayor in 1991 and 1992. Tucker has proclaimed his 
innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 Potter declined to comment on whether Moore has agreed to testify against 
Tucker or whether prosecutors will recommend leniency for her as part of the 
plea-bargain arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Carl E. Douglas, one of Tucker's attorneys, said that "all the signs 
appear to point to" Moore's being a "key witness for the prosecution" when 
Tucker goes to trial in February. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of their investigation, authorities have seized documents from a dozen 
city departments and subpoenaed the campaign records of seven officials, 
including Moore, who was on the City Council when the alleged bribery occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, authorities are known to be examining relationships between some 
of those officials and several prominent developers. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Moore declined to comment on whether she is cooperating with 
authorities, and appeared to express second thoughts about having pleaded 
guilty to the two charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been under a lot of pressure. They were making out like they were going 
to try to put me in jail and throw away the key. I don't know, I'm just tired," 
she said, her voice trailing off. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore entered the pleas before U. S. Dist. Judge Consuelo B. Marshall on 
Monday, even though federal prosecutors did not make the announcement until 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Moore expressed irritation that the plea arrangement had been 
made public. "(The prosecutors) told me there wouldn't be a press release," she 
said. "I feel betrayed by them." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore's attorney, Paul Potter of Pasadena, said his client made the plea in 
the hope of making a fresh start in her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's young, she's bright, and she's done some positive things," he said. "I 
think her hope is that she will now be able to put all this turbulence behind 
her." 
</P>
<P>
 John Potter, the federal prosecutor, refused to identify the person from whom 
Moore admitted extorting money. But sources have told The Times that it was San 
Gabriel Valley businessman John Macardican, who triggered the federal probe 
after complaining that Compton officials had solicited him for bribes in 
connection with the incinerator project. 
</P>
<P>
 These sources say that besides the incident in which Moore has admitted 
extorting the money, investigators have video and audiotapes of other meetings 
in which Moore accepted or discussed bribes. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore pleaded guilty to failing to file a federal tax return for 1992, even 
though she earned income and owed federal income taxes for that year, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore and Tucker were part of a City Council majority that in July, 1992, 
approved an exclusive negotiating agreement for Macardican's company to develop 
the incinerator. After the vote, Macardican never pursued the project. He 
formally withdrew his proposal earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Once an aide to former Congressman Mervyn M. Dymally, Moore was elected to the 
City Council in 1989 after organizing demonstrations for gun control after the 
drive-by shooting of a 2-year-old. She gave up her seat in 1993 to make an 
unsuccessful run for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Her outspokenness led to her appearance twice on the "Nightline" and once on 
the "MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour" television programs and made her a lightning rod 
for controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 After a judge sentenced grocer Soon Ja Du to five years probation in 1991 for 
killing 15-year-old Latasha Harlins, a black customer in her store, Moore told 
a phalanx of reporters, photographers and television cameras, "There is no 
justice for African Americans in this country."

CURBING CHOLESTEROL WITH DRUGS AIDS HEART PATIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scandinavian researchers have produced the first long-term evidence that 
lowering cholesterol levels with drugs can substantially increase survival in 
patients who have already had a heart attack or who have heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-year study of nearly 4,500 patients between the ages of 35 and 70 
showed that those who took the drug simvastatin were 43% less likely to die of 
heart disease, 34% less likely to suffer a nonfatal heart attack or other 
"coronary event" and 37% less likely to require a coronary artery bypass or 
other invasive procedures, the researchers will report today at a meeting of 
the American Heart Assn. in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally important, those who successfully lowered their cholesterol were no 
more likely to die of other causes, including cancer, suicide and violence, as 
had been suggested by some earlier studies. 
</P>
<P>
 The results were so dramatic that the study was ended prematurely and the drug 
offered to all those receiving a placebo. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings appear to confirm the role of cholesterol as a major risk factor 
in heart disease. More than 85% of the 12 million Americans with heart disease 
have high cholesterol levels, according to the National Institutes of Health, 
and as many as 6 million could potentially benefit from use of the drug. Heart 
disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, killing more than 
923,000 people each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This study is unique because it is the first to conclusively demonstrate 
improved survival -- people living longer," said Dr. Terje R. Pedersen of Aker 
University Hospital in Oslo, a co-leader of the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the next five years," said his colleague, Dr. John Kjekahus of the 
University of Oslo, "we expect these findings to have a tremendous impact on 
standard treatment for heart attack and angina patients." In terms of reducing 
risk, he said, "Taking simvastatin is just as important as quitting smoking." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a landmark study," said Dr. Roger Illingworth of the Oregon Health 
Sciences University, one of the few outside researchers familiar with the 
results. "If you take a population with heart disease and moderate elevations 
of cholesterol and give them this drug, the patients live longer and you don't 
increase the risk of other side effects. That is a very important finding. . . 
. And the longer you give the drug, the greater the benefit." 
</P>
<P>
 The study provides a strong message for the public and physicians, said Dr. 
James Cleeman, coordinator of the National Cholesterol Education Project at the 
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. High cholesterol levels in heart 
disease patients, he said, should be treated aggressively with diet therapy 
and, if that fails, with drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether with diet or drugs, he added, lowering cholesterol can save lives. 
"The payoff seems quite clear." 
</P>
<P>
 Simvastatin, manufactured by Merck & Co., is one of a family of chemically 
similar cholesterol-lowering drugs that also includes lovastatin and 
pravastatin. Lovastatin, the best known, is isolated from a fungus and blocks 
the action of an enzyme that is crucial to the synthesis of cholesterol in the 
body. Simvastatin is a chemically modified variant of lovastatin that binds to 
the enzyme more tightly, thereby blocking its function more effectively. 
Simvastatin has been available in Europe since 1988 and in the United States 
since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Most previous studies have been performed with lovastatin, which lowers 
cholesterol levels by about 10%, according to the National Institutes of 
Health. "We've had small studies before that have shown that lowering 
cholesterol produces significant benefits . . . but the data wasn't conclusive 
and it didn't show a significant trend toward reduced mortality," Cleeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new, larger study found that simvastatin reduced cholesterol 25% and 
lowered low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the so-called bad cholesterol, by 35%. 
"This is the most effective cholesterol-lowering agent we know of," Pedersen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers recruited 7,027 patients who had had a heart attack or 
unstable angina and who had cholesterol levels in the range 212 to 309 
milligrams per deciliter of blood. All patients were given dietary advice and 
sent home for two months to see if they could reduce those levels. Those who 
could not and were medically approved were enrolled in the study. 
</P>
<P>
 Half the 4,444 participants received dietary intervention and simvastatin. The 
other half received dietary intervention and a placebo. The participants were 
monitored for an average of 5.4 years, and the researchers will continue to 
monitor them in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 In the study, 256 patients in the placebo group died, compared to 182 in the 
drug group, a 29% reduction. In the placebo group, 189 died of coronary causes, 
compared to 111 in the drug group. Also in the placebo category, 622 suffered 
either fatal or major, nonfatal heart attacks, compared to 431 in the 
simvastatin group. 
</P>
<P>
 Those in the drug group were also 37% less likely to require a coronary artery 
bypass or angioplasty, in which a balloon-tipped catheter is used to open blood 
vessels feeding the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 The patients receiving simvastatin had "minimal adverse events," Pedersen 
said. The main side effect of the drug is a reversible malfunction of the 
liver. The number of patients who dropped out of the study because of adverse 
effects was 129 in the placebo group and 126 in the drug group. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no significant differences in the numbers of cases of suicide, 
cancer or deaths due to violence, in contrast to some controversial previous 
studies that found an increased incidence of such deaths among people who 
lowered their cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, Kjekahus said, demonstrates "beyond a doubt that physicians can use 
a well-tolerated medicine to influence the course of coronary heart disease and 
help people live longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Results of the study are scheduled to be published Saturday in the 
international medical journal Lancet. The study was funded by Merck. More heart

WORKPLACE ERGONOMICS RULES FACE KEY TEST IN STATE; SAFETY: CONTROVERSIAL 
STANDARDS WOULD BE FIRST IN THE NATION. BOARD'S RULING IS EXPECTED TO HAVE 
NATIONAL IMPACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Are the walking wounded in the American work force -- a rapidly expanding 
group including everyone from supermarket cashiers with carpal tunnel syndrome 
to meat packers suffering from tendinitis -- finally going to get major help 
from government regulators? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer will become clearer today when the board that sets California's 
workplace safety standards votes on a package of regulations that would be the 
nation's first comprehensive ergonomics program. The proposed program, which 
would apply to every employer and employee in the state, is designed to curb 
cumulative trauma disorders, the painful ailments linked to repetitive motions. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's decision by the six-member state Occupational Safety and Health 
Standards Board in San Diego will resonate across the country. It is being 
followed closely by federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
officials struggling to draft an ergonomics program of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 If the current California plan is defeated -- and if it later is replaced by a 
weaker measure, or nothing at all -- federal authorities might pull back on the 
controversial issue. If it passes, some observers say it could reinvigorate 
federal workplace regulators, whose efforts have run into resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's going on in California is a reflection of the forces coming to bear on 
this kind of proposal" across the country, said Maggie Robbins, coordinator of 
health and safety issues for the western region of the Service Employees 
International Union. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's proposed standard -- a toned-down version of a plan that the 
Cal/OSHA staff drafted late last year -- has been branded as too burdensome by 
some business leaders and too weak by union officials and other safety 
advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 Thwarting efforts to craft a compromise have been the complex and 
unpredictable politics of cumulative trauma disorders, which have increased 
explosively to become the leading occupational illness in America. Last week's 
smashing Republican election victories around the country could complicate 
matters further by prompting regulators to re-evaluate their stances. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, the state's proposal calls for employers to train all workers to 
alert them to the early symptoms of cumulative trauma disorders, which are also 
called CTDs or repetitive stress injuries. Employers also would have to set up 
procedures for employees to report such symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, employers would need to make a one-time review of their medical, 
safety and workers' compensation records to determine if their employees suffer 
CTD symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, for employers who have workers already experiencing such problems or 
have a solid reason to believe that the employees could develop such problems, 
remedial measures would be required. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers, however, would have a relatively free hand in coming up with 
solutions, as long as those solutions worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a lot of flexibility in deciding how to go about it," said Lloyd W. 
Aubry Jr., director of the California Department of Industrial Relations, which 
oversees Cal/OSHA. "One company might give people working on VDTs (video 
display terminals) more breaks. Another company might make equipment changes." 
</P>
<P>
 In other cases, the problems might be handled simply through stepped-up 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 One irony in the opposition from business groups is that the state Legislature 
mandated an ergonomics program in its 1993 workers' compensation reform package 
as a way to help cut employers' costs for workers' compensation coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent U.S. statistics report 281,800 cases of such disorders in 
1992, up more than twelvefold from a decade earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, earlier this year, many workplace safety advocates had high hopes that 
authorities both in California and Washington would take substantial steps 
toward combatting CTDs. The state Legislature told Cal/OSHA to pass its 
ergonomics program by Jan. 1, and federal officials promised to submit a 
preliminary program by Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 But circumstances have changed substantially in the last two months. Facing 
intensified opposition from employers and bogged down in tedious analyses, 
federal OSHA missed its self-imposed September deadline and is not saying when 
its initial proposal will come out. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, meanwhile, speculation is building that the board may ignore 
its year-end deadline for adopting a program and go back to the drawing board. 
</P>
<P>
 After Cal/OSHA in September released the current version of the proposal -- 
which was intended to be the final version -- 97 letters arrived from various 
interest groups objecting to the plan. Given that opposition, "the board might 
say, 'Why are we doing this? No one wants it,' " Aubry said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gradually, as the proposal became better known, and more and more employers 
began looking at it more closely, they said, 'Wait a minute, this is going to 
cost more than we thought,' " he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers in California and across the country contend that, given the lack of 
scientific data concerning ergonomic problems and solutions, it is premature 
for regulators to impose potentially costly and burdensome programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a very complex, very difficult subject about which the scientific and 
medical communities are very much up in the air. This is not something we know 
how to correct," said Jeffrey M. Tanenbaum, a San Francisco lawyer representing 
employers opposed to the California proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it also is unfair to place burdens on employers for CTDs that stem 
from off-the-job activities or that may be largely psychosomatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "These cases seem to grow in a workplace. If one person thinks they have a 
repetitive stress injury, it's not surprising to see someone else think they 
may have it too," Tanenbaum argued. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, supporters of ergonomics regulations -- including employers 
such as Blue Cross of California that have adopted plans of their own -- say 
substantial anecdotal evidence already shows that crippling CTDs can be 
prevented. 
</P>
<P>
 Unions and other safety advocates critical of the proposed California 
standard, however, say the current plan contains too many loopholes. Among 
other things, it would not require employers to provide medical attention for 
employees with early symptoms of CTDs unless the employees filed workers' 
compensation claims. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the plan would exempt employers who demonstrate that a remedial 
plan would impose an undue economic hardship. Robbins of the service employees 
union says that might enable rogue employers to bamboozle OSHA inspectors and 
avoid dealing with serious health problems. Also, she said, it would place 
honest employers at a competitive disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we going to have accountants go out with health inspectors? I don't think 
so," Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we want to treat employers fairly, we need to treat them all the same," 
she added.

WHITE HOUSE SCRAMBLES FOR TRADE PACT SUPPORT; ECONOMY: GOP LEADERS ARE HESITANT 
ON GATT VOTE. BUT CLINTON AIDES STILL EXPECT APPROVAL IN LAME-DUCK SESSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The White House scrambled Wednesday to retain bipartisan support for a world 
trade agreement in the face of concerns raised by newly emboldened Republican 
leaders in the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration embarked on what one senior White House official 
described as "a very intense strategy" for securing approval after incoming 
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) expressed concern that the pact would 
limit U.S. autonomy and Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who is expected to be the 
next House Speaker, stated that its approval is far from certain. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite those concerns, the senior White House official, who asked that he not 
be named, and others in the Administration expressed confidence that the trade 
accord will prevail when the current Democratic-controlled Congress meets in a 
lame-duck special session later this month to vote on it. The pact would create 
a World Trade Organization as a successor to the 47-year-old General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade, which now governs global commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican opposition to the pact would mark a striking shift from the party's 
tradition as the champion of free trade and abandonment of a central element of 
the GOP approach to foreign policy and economics. Throughout much of the 
post-Depression era, Republicans have been bedrock supporters of reducing trade 
barriers. Their support was critical to approval of the North American Free 
Trade Agreement last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But GOP leaders, emboldened by their Nov. 8 electoral landslide, are preparing 
to take power in the new Congress, with many conservative members of the party 
playing leading roles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's campaign for the trade plan, which the House is scheduled 
to bring to a vote on Nov. 29 and the Senate two days later, has been thrown 
into a maelstrom over the last 10 days as first Dole and then Sen. Jesse Helms 
(R-N.C.) expressed reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 To pressure those who are not yet committed to the trade pact, Vice President 
Al Gore said Wednesday that "Congress will decide whether the United States 
will continue to lead the world on global economic issues or not. . . . It is a 
critical vote for U.S. leadership in the world, and it is a critical vote for 
the health of the U.S. economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole, whose support is considered crucial for lining up the needed Republican 
votes, is concerned that the World Trade Organization would have the authority 
to overturn U.S. laws or regulations that it decides unfairly block other 
nation's exports to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole said Wednesday that the vote should be delayed if those concerns cannot 
be addressed. "If we can't fix it, we shouldn't do it this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich urged the Administration to accommodate Dole's concerns or face the 
prospect that the agreement could go down to defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the looming problem, President Clinton -- in Indonesia for an 
economic meeting of Asian and Pacific nations -- said that people "want to be 
assured that we're not giving up the ability to run our own affairs." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said that a delay might kill the agreement because 
the other 120 nations involved might lose confidence in the United States' 
commitment to free trade. New demands by unhappy nations then could unravel 
compromises worked out during seven years of international negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor began what were 
expected to be several days of negotiations with Dole. White House officials 
said that Kantor hopes to work out an agreement under which Congress would vote 
in the future on whether the World Trade Organization is working to the United 
States' satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 By including such a provision, or one establishing a commission to review the 
trade authority's operation, Dole could tell critics that if the pact works 
against U.S. interests, Congress could force the government to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
 Helms has held out the possibility that in his new position as chairman of the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he would be inclined to give the 
Administration's foreign policy initiatives a friendlier reception if a vote on 
the agreement is delayed until next year, when the new GOP-controlled Congress 
convenes -- a prospect that Administration officials view with skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the agreement would cut tariffs -- the taxes charged on imports -- by 
roughly $740 billion around the world, it is being described by its supporters 
as the biggest tax cut in history. 
</P>
<P>
 The average 40% reduction in tariffs would prompt a surge in U.S. economic 
activity that would pump $65 billion to $200 billion into the U.S. economy by 
the middle of the next decade, proponents argue. But some industries would lose 
the protection that they depend on to fight competition from low-cost imports. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is portraying the pact as one of the most important issues 
ever to come before Congress, arguing that it is on a par with the vote that 
defeated the League of Nations, which many have said set the course for World 
War II, and the vote approving the Marshall Plan, which provided the economic 
support for rebuilding Europe after that war. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House is also describing the pact as the first test of whether 
Republicans in the next Congress will be as determined to cooperate with the 
Democrats and the White House as Dole and Gingrich have said they will. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most difficult obstacles facing the Administration deals not with 
the substance of the trade plan but with the need to waive a regulation 
requiring that any loss in revenue be made up by cutting spending or increasing 
taxes. Under budget deficit reduction regulations, 60 votes are needed for the 
waiver. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the trade pact would cut tax revenue and sufficient spending cuts or 
tax increases have not been designated, Helms and others have argued that it 
will add $31 billion to the budget deficit.

COLUMN ONE; TARGETING FOREIGN SMOKERS; AS SALES LAG AT HOME, U.S. TOBACCO FIRMS 
TRY TO CONQUER ASIA AND EAST EUROPE. IN HONG KONG, PHILIP MORRIS ONCE BOUGHT 
EVERY NEWSPAPER FRONT PAGE TO PUSH MARLBORO.

 Let health groups call them drug pushers; let members of Congress hand them 
their heads. U.S. cigarette makers are riding high, now that the world is 
Marlboro Country. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans keep smoking less, but tobacco companies are finding more than 
enough foreigners to take their places. From the smoke-filled cafes of Eastern 
Europe to the billboard jungles of Asia, the firms are out there pitching -- 
often using TV and other strategies they cannot use at home: 
</P>
<P>
 * In China, the world's biggest tobacco market, Philip Morris has become the 
financial angel of professional soccer, underwriting the Marlboro Soccer 
League, named for the company's flagship brand. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Prague, capital of the Czech Republic, R.J. Reynolds has marched couples 
down the aisle in "Camel" weddings, complete with Camel-insignia taxis to 
shuttle the guests. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the Philippines, Asia's most Roman Catholic nation, promotional calendars 
display U.S. and local cigarette brands under a picture of the Virgin Mary. 
</P>
<P>
 * In chain-smoking Eastern Europe, the U.S. companies are becoming a huge 
force in cigarette manufacturing, with Philip Morris and Reynolds between them 
having entered into 14 joint ventures with state tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Here at home, tobacco companies are circling the wagons, fighting to save what 
they can of a shrinking market. But the industry's big three -- Philip Morris, 
R.J. Reynolds and Brown & Williamson -- are seizing new turf in the developing 
world, where smoking is on the rise and American cigarettes still symbolize 
elegance and style. 
</P>
<P>
 With billions of dollars at stake, tobacco firms have turned to political 
heavyweights for help in penetrating foreign markets. Former British Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher is an adviser to Philip Morris -- although neither 
she nor the firm will discuss her work or consulting fee, a reported $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The overseas push began years ago, as rising health concerns caused U.S. sales 
to fall. But recent events in Eastern Europe and Asia have quickened the pace. 
</P>
<P>
 In the newly independent states of the former Soviet Bloc, the collapse of 
communism has opened the floodgates to investment by tobacco firms. Eastern 
Europe has the world's highest rates of smoking-related deaths, but it is also 
starved for capital. U.S.- and Europe-based tobacco multinationals have 
committed more than $1.5 billion to build or retool cigarette plants throughout 
the region -- often in joint ventures with state tobacco monopolies that once 
had the business to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Across economically booming Asia -- the only region where cigarette 
consumption, per capita, is clearly growing -- the U.S. government has smashed 
trade barriers that kept out U.S. smokes. From 1986 to 1990, Japan, Taiwan, 
South Korea and Thailand each caved in to threats of trade sanctions, allowing 
American cigarettes to compete with monopoly brands. 
</P>
<P>
 The full-court press is paying big dividends. Although U.S. consumption has 
fallen in each of the last 10 years -- and by 20% over the decade -- cigarette 
exports have more than tripled and sales from U.S. tobacco plants abroad have 
surged. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Morris alone sold 460 billion cigarettes abroad in 1993 -- nearly as 
many as Americans bought from the company and all its rivals combined. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our worldwide tobacco business has never been in better shape," the firm 
recently told shareholders. "As large as we have grown, however, our brands 
only account for approximately 12% of the worldwide cigarette market -- leaving 
plenty of room for profitable growth." 
</P>
<P>
 Cigarette exports have also been one of the few bright spots in the U.S. trade 
picture, shaving the trade deficit by $23.5 billion over the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the cigarette makers are turning their backs on America. Profit 
margins remain higher in the United States than abroad. Indeed, the companies 
will keep fighting smoking restrictions here -- as Philip Morris did in its 
failed campaign on behalf of California's Proposition 188 -- to preserve 
domestic sales and because other countries tend to copy U.S. smoking curbs. 
</P>
<P>
 But as time passes and the industry extends its global reach, its problems at 
home seem to matter less and less. 
</P>
<P>
 "For every smoker who quits in the U.S., two teen-agers start smoking in 
China," said Dr. Judith Mackay, a Hong Kong-based physician and consultant who 
has advised Asian countries on tobacco control. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years ago, the wealthy, industrialized West led the world in smoking, 
according to tobacco consumption data compiled by the World Health 
Organization. Today, the situation essentially is reversed, with three poorer 
nations -- Poland, Greece and Hungary -- atop the list. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend has raised deep concern among health authorities who fear that poor 
nations, struggling to eliminate malnutrition and lift standards of public 
health, face a looming, American-style epidemic of lung cancer. One particular 
concern is that aggressive advertising will boost smoking among women, who now 
smoke in low numbers in many of the countries receiving the cigarette makers' 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "The developing countries are sitting on a time bomb," said Richard Peto, a 
noted epidemiologist at the University of Oxford in England. 
</P>
<P>
 Worldwide, about 3 million people each year die of smoking-related causes -- 
about 2 million of them in the developed world, according to estimates by the 
World Health Organization. If smoking patterns continue, the annual toll will 
reach 10 million by the 2020s -- with about 7 million of the victims from the 
developing world. According to the estimates, about half the victims will die 
in middle age, losing on average 20 to 25 years of life expectancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry critics say that efforts to reduce the death toll are being 
undermined by the aggressive marketing of tobacco multinationals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not afraid of foreign cigarettes, but we are afraid of their marketing 
prowess," said Dr. Hatai Chitanondh, a Thai physician who is president of the 
Asia and Pacific Assn. for Control of Tobacco. "They have the best brains in 
marketing." 
</P>
<P>
 Developing nations are often "attracted to anything American, and promoting 
the Western lifestyle and linking these cigarettes to the United States makes 
them particularly attractive," said Michael Eriksen, director of the U.S. 
Office on Smoking and Health, who termed the tobacco industry's conduct 
"abysmal." 
</P>
<P>
 The industry and its supporters reject the morbid arithmetic and logic of 
their critics. They say tobacco companies are merely competing for the 
loyalties of existing smokers, who in many cases had no choice until now of 
whose cigarettes to buy. Moreover, they argue, since U.S. brands invariably 
cost more in foreign markets than local brands, they do not make smoking more 
affordable to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Smoking is not something like rock music, which America has just exported," 
said Owen C. Smith, a vice president with Philip Morris International and 
president of the U.S. Cigarette Export Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are hundreds of millions of smokers outside the United States," he 
said, "and the . . . issue is whether those smokers will have the liberty to 
choose an American product or be restricted to smoking only those made by a 
protected . . . local industry." 
</P>
<P>
 But few outside the industry believe its claim that advertising simply steals 
smokers from rival brands rather than triggering demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every marketing plan . . . involves both an element of market share and 
market expansion," said Michael Pertschuk, former head of the Federal Trade 
Commission and co-director of the Advocacy Institute, a public interest group. 
</P>
<P>
 The marketing blitz has hit many countries where smoking was common but 
cigarette advertising was almost unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 In the newly independent states of Eastern Europe and in several Asian 
nations, state monopolies that supplied smokers did little or nothing to 
promote their brands. 
</P>
<P>
 The Western invasion, for instance, was a wake-up call in Japan, the world's 
fourth-largest cigarette market. Japan Tobacco, the national monopoly, has 
become a big advertiser at home and is also hawking its brands abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond advertising's immediate effects on smoking habits, critics fear that 
big media spending in target countries will induce a wave of self-censorship -- 
such as the one that once chilled U.S. media coverage of smoking and health 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Cigarette advertising "will prevent the story from being told straight," Peto 
said. "The more they (the tobacco companies) become established politically, 
the more difficult it's going to be to get the information across to people." 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating the onslaught, some countries established restrictions or bans on 
tobacco advertising. But in many cases, the laws proved toothless or left 
loopholes that companies have been happy to exploit. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Russia, whose Parliament last year banned tobacco ads from radio, TV 
and billboards -- but without obvious effect. Russian media will not willingly 
sacrifice the revenue, and tobacco companies will not stop advertising as long 
as rivals continue to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 In Moscow, revolutionary statues and posters have given way to the logos and 
hues of Western cigarette brands, which appear on billboards, bus shelters and 
illuminated signs. Cigarette ads are an imposing feature of the cityscape -- 
not only because there are lots of them, but because in many places there is 
little advertising of any other kind. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, wide-open Russia is a place where dedicated marketers can work off 
their wintertime blues. As cold and gloom descended on St. Petersburg last 
year, the R.J. Reynolds sales staff painted the town with the yellow and blue 
of the Camel brand. The troops brightened shops and kiosks with Camel stickers, 
posters and window frames, and within two weeks "725 locations were Camelized," 
according to an account in a company newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the United States, the cigarette makers sponsor sporting and cultural 
events in Russia. Philip Morris underwrote a tour by the Bolshoi Ballet. R.J. 
Reynolds sponsored a rock festival last spring in St. Petersburg. According to 
a company spokeswoman, such sponsorships "play a crucial role in making 
sporting, cultural and entertainment events more affordable and more 
professional." 
</P>
<P>
 There is little outward opposition to the smoke that seems to hang everywhere, 
with park benches as likely to be smoky as nightclubs and cafes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not teaching them to smoke," Constantin Ohanian, an R.J. Reynolds vice 
president, said in his St. Petersburg office last May as he used a lighter 
shaped like a hand grenade to fire up a cigarette. "People here want to smoke, 
and we are providing them with what they want." 
</P>
<P>
 Every autumn, Polish health authorities stage a national stop-smoking day to 
coincide with today's Great American Smokeout. But this year, tobacco companies 
have tried to upstage it with a simultaneous contest offering prizes for 
smokers, according to Dr. Witold Zatonski, a Polish physician and chairman of 
the International Union Against Cancer's tobacco and health program in Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort was especially "cynical" in Poland, "a country in which premature 
death in adult men . . . is rising," Zatonski complained. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaning Poles from the smoking habit "is not very easy," he said, because "the 
tobacco industry is having (a) quite different goal." 
</P>
<P>
 In Hungary, as in Russia, companies have found ways around the ban on 
cigarette advertising. Dressed in the stripes and colors of Western brands, 
young women distribute free samples in cafes and bars. In the capital, 
Budapest, brand names such as Marlboro and Lucky Strike, sold by British-based 
BAT Industries, have been incorporated in the names of pubs and coffeehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Camel Boots" footwear stores project the brand's image of rugged, outdoor 
adventure. A German-based subsidiary runs Camel Boots, according to an R.J. 
Reynolds official in Hungary. But the stores are "not a cigarette promotion 
tool," the official insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 Hungary has seen the stirrings of anti-smoking activism. In Budapest last 
year, protesters pasted skulls and painted the Hungarian word for "cancer" on 
cigarette posters. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, though, the industry is seeking more freedom to promote its brands. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of corporate relations for Philip Morris in Hungary wrote the local 
heads of rival firms in December, 1992, suggesting that an industry delegation 
"should try to test the limits of the flexibility of the government and have a 
better understanding about the relation of power among ministries." 
</P>
<P>
 "The industry should continue to talk to high-level politicians to maintain 
pressure on the bureaucracy," said the letter, whose contents were confirmed by 
company officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Although less visible than advertising, the industry's investment in cigarette 
plants in Eastern Europe is even more dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the way is Philip Morris, which has committed more than $800 million 
to eight joint ventures in Russia, Lithuania, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Poland, 
Hungary, the former East Germany and the Czech Republic -- where the company 
says it is the largest U.S. investor. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the tobacco industry's growing hold on Eastern Europe will 
interfere with smoking control efforts. "They're buying political influence by 
going into these countries and saying, 'We want to help you with your economy,' 
" said Scott Ballin, chairman of the Coalition on Smoking OR Health, a U.S. 
anti-smoking group. "You don't bite the hand that feeds you." 
</P>
<P>
 Asia, with 54% of the world's people, holds even more promise in the long run. 
In many Asian countries, smoking rates are high among men but low among women 
-- leaving room for market expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Asian anti-smoking efforts are gathering strength, but cigarette sales still 
are forecast to rise 13% during the 1990s, according to Euromonitor 
International, a market research organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic growth and rising disposable incomes, along with less awareness of 
health risks than in the West, all favor the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Philippines, where nearly two-thirds of men and one-fifth of women 
smoke, a 1990 survey found that 57% of respondents were unaware that cigarettes 
cause cancer, according to the British journal Tobacco Control. 
</P>
<P>
 In China, which consumes one-third of all the cigarettes in the world, the 
government has signed joint manufacturing agreements with three Western tobacco 
giants and has agreed to begin opening its market to import brands by the end 
of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Asian countries hold "vast potential" and are being "heavily targeted by the 
tobacco multinationals," a recent Euromonitor report said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apart from their great financial strength and worldwide marketing experience, 
the multinationals are in a good position to exploit the emerging markets . . . 
because of their global reputation and the inherent cosmopolitan nature of 
their brand images," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 American firms have already increased Asian tobacco sales by billions of 
dollars, thanks to help from the U.S. government. U.S. trade negotiators 
pressured Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand -- which all had tobacco 
monopolies -- to open their markets to American cigarettes. At the industry's 
insistence, trade officials further demanded that U.S. firms be free to 
advertise their brands, even though cigarette advertising in the four countries 
had been virtually nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan agreed to permit a wide range of advertising, including TV commercials. 
Taiwan and South Korea also accepted some forms of cigarette advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Exports to the four countries last year reached about 65 billion cigarettes. 
In Japan, U.S. brands have captured about 18% of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 What skilled marketers can do in Asia is reflected in Marlboro's conquest of 
Hong Kong -- an accomplishment detailed in an oral history exhibit at the 
Smithsonian Institution's Center for Advertising History. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlboro was a nothing brand in Hong Kong, with less than 1% of the market, 
when Philip Morris began its campaign in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 The company discovered that Marlboro's cowboy symbol was an ambiguous figure 
to the Chinese -- rugged and tough, but also an itinerant who slept outdoors 
and could be perceived as a coolie. So Philip Morris produced new TV spots for 
Hong Kong in which the cowboy was presented as a boss -- a clean-cut man of 
property who lived in a big ranch house and rode a white horse, a symbol of 
luck. 
</P>
<P>
 When Marlboro dislodged Reynolds' Winston cigarettes as America's most popular 
brand in rankings compiled by a U.S. analyst, Philip Morris made it a big event 
in Hong Kong. A well-known TV personality was flown to New York and stationed 
outside Philip Morris' Park Avenue headquarters to make the announcement by 
live satellite link. 
</P>
<P>
 Another time, Philip Morris bought the front pages of all of Hong Kong's major 
newspapers for an "advertorial" on the success of Marlboro, recalled William I. 
Campbell, former vice president of Philip Morris Asia and now president of 
Philip Morris USA. 
</P>
<P>
 "So on the given day, Jan. 10 or something like that, you go past . . . the 
street newsstand, and . . . all of the 10 newspapers, they all have the same 
front page," Campbell told a Smithsonian interviewer. "That was great fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Marlboro soon became Hong Kong's leading brand and now holds a market share of 
more than 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco firms in Asia cannot always use the weapons that Marlboro employed in 
Hong Kong. Hong Kong itself has placed limits on tobacco ads; in Thailand, 
direct cigarette advertising is banned. 
</P>
<P>
 But Philip Morris, the world's biggest tobacco company, still does what it 
can. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year in Bangkok, the company staged a pair of concerts in its "Superband" 
series with Tony Bennett and the McCoy Tyner Trio. It announced that it would 
donate proceeds to a charity founded by Thailand's most revered figure, its 
king. 
</P>
<P>
 In Asia, as in the United States, Philip Morris has sought to win friends and 
quiet critics through lavish support of the arts. This fall, it underwrote a 
gala international arts competition for the six countries of the Assn. of 
Southeast Asian Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The cigarette makers have shown real ingenuity in Malaysia. The country banned 
direct TV advertising of cigarette brands, so the U.S. and European tobacco 
firms have attached their brand names and logos to a host of unrelated products 
and services for which no ad restrictions exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Malaysia, for example, has Salem Power Stations -- youth-oriented music stores 
named for R.J. Reynolds' popular menthol brand. 
</P>
<P>
 There also have been lavish TV ads for "Salem Holidays." Attractive young 
couples stroll through alpine scenery as music plays and a narrator intones: 
"Salem High Country -- a world of refreshment!" But there is no information on 
destinations, travel dates or prices, and a travel agency's name appears only 
in the fine print. 
</P>
<P>
 When a documentary film crew from Yorkshire Television of England sent a 
representative to book a Salem Holiday, the travel agent told him: "No, no, no. 
We only advertise the name." 
</P>
<P>
 "Salem Power Station and Salem Holidays . . . are real businesses," R.J. 
Reynolds said in a written response to questions from The Times. "Neither sell 
cigarettes," the statement said. Use of the Salem name "is consistent with 
practices around the world to extend valuable trademarks to unrelated 
products." 
</P>

Bureau contributed to this report.

Tobacco's Long Road 
</P>
<P>
 Americans are smoking less -- much less -- than in years past, dropping from 
the ranks of the world's biggest smokers per capita. But U.S. tobacco companies 
are making up for declining domestic consumption by dramatically boosting 
cigarette exports and sales fromm factories abroad.

<P>
 Seeking to penetrate foreign markets, tobacco companies have sought the help 
of some powerhouse lobbyists and advisers. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Thatcher: A critic of smoking while Britain's prime minister, 
Thatcher has since become a consultant to the world's biggest tobacco company, 
Philip Morris. Thatcher declined to be interviewed, and spokeswoman Miranda 
Granger would not discuss her work for Philip Morris, reportedly a three-year 
deal worth $1 million. The company was tight-lipped, too. "She's a consultant 
on geopolitical affairs. End of statement," said Elizabeth Cho of Philip Morris 
International. In a March, 1992, memo, Geoffrey C. Bible, then executive vice 
president and now president and chief executive of Philip Morris, outlined 
issues facing the firm's tobacco and food businesses where Thatcher "may be 
able to offer guidance and assistance."They included: "China Entry Strategy," 
"Vietnam Entry Strategy," "Singapore Anti-tobacco Programs", and privatization 
of tobacco monopolies in Japan, Taiwan, Korea and Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton Yeutter: U.S. trade representative and then secretary of agriculture 
in the Reagan and Bush administrations, Yeutter has since joined the board of 
British-based BAT Industries, the world's second-largest tobacco company. As 
trade representative from 1985-89, Yeutter forced the governments of Taiwan, 
South Korea, and Japan to let in American tobacco products. Export sales by 
U.S. tobacco firms rose more than $1 billion per year. During at least part of 
his tenure as trade representative, the Yeutter family had stock in RJR Nabisco 
and Philip Morris -- some in his name, some held in trust for a daughter, 
according to disclosure statements Yeutter filed. He sold the stock when he 
became agriculture secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Carla A. Hills: Yeutter's successor as U.S. trade representative from 
1989-'93, Hills helped U.S. cigarette makers crack Thailand's tobacco monopoly. 
Earlier this year, RJR and Philip Morris retained Hills' law and consulting 
firms to help fight a Canadian proposal to require plain packaging of 
cigarettes sold in that country. In an opinion submitted to Canadian 
authorities, Hills concluded that the packaging rules would violate 
international trademark laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard V. Allen and Michael K. Deaver: In the mid-1980s, Allen, former 
national security advisor to President Reagan, was hired as a lobbyist by R.J. 
Reynolds in its battle to enter the South Korean tobacco market. As a 
countermeasure, Philip Morris hired Deaver, a former Reagan White House aide. 
Deaver was retained for $250,000 in response to rumors that Allen was telling 
the South Koreans that Philip Morris was aligned with Democrats and lacked 
influence in the Reagan White House. To shore up its Republican credentials, 
Philip Morris also engaged lobbyist Michelle Laxalt, daughter of former senator 
and Reagan confidante Paul Laxalt. When Deaver was tried in 1987 on charges of 
lying to Congress and a federal grand jury about his lobbying activities, a 
Philip Morris memo was introduced as evidence. The memo boasted that Deaver 
"was given a welcome ordinarily reserved for the highest foreign dignitaries" 
when he visited South Korea on Philip Morris' behalf. However, South Korea did 
not open its doors to American cigarettes until 1988, in response to the threat 
of trade sanctions. Deaver was convicted and sentenced to probation, community 
service and a $100,000 fine.

UKRAINE AGREES TO RELINQUISH NUCLEAR ARMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY MYCIO and SONNI EFRON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After three years of agonized wrangling, the Ukrainian Parliament closed 
another Cold War chapter Wednesday by agreeing to join the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty and surrender nuclear weapons forever. 
</P>
<P>
 However, lawmakers qualified their approval of the treaty by demanding that 
the United States, Britain, France and Russia sign an international agreement 
promising not to attack Ukraine militarily or economically after it dismantles 
its 1,800 nuclear warheads, the third-largest atomic arsenal in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. and Russian officials had lobbied hard to extract the agreement from a 
recalcitrant legislature that has long feared Ukraine's problems will drop to 
the bottom of the world's agenda once the former Soviet republic ceased to be a 
nuclear power. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukrainian President Leonid D. Kuchma warned of financial ruin and political 
ostracism if lawmakers insisted on keeping the 176 missiles left on Ukrainian 
territory when the Soviet Union collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 "What will the treaty give Ukraine?" Kuchma asked lawmakers. "A good 
reputation, which we don't have now." 
</P>
<P>
 The Parliament, or Rada, voted 301 to 8, with 20 abstentions, to join the 160 
other countries that have already signed the non-proliferation treaty. The vote 
means that Kuchma will get a more sympathetic reception when he makes his first 
state visit to the United States next week and asks for more help in reviving 
Ukraine's moribund economy. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Ambassador William Miller, who watched the voting from the Rada gallery, 
predicted that the vote "will clear the way for strengthening relations between 
the United States and Ukraine." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly applauded the 
ratification and said the Clinton Administration "takes a strong interest in 
Ukraine's independence, its sovereignty and its existing borders." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're prepared to offer security assurances to Ukraine once it has acceded to 
the treaty," Shelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have, of course, very strongly supported and encouraged Ukraine's 
accession to the NPT as a non-nuclear weapons state," she said. "So we applaud 
the leadership exhibited by President Kuchma in bringing this very important 
treaty before the Rada." 
</P>
<P>
 Russian officials also praised the treaty vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good news!" agreed Yuri Dubinin, Russia's special envoy to Ukraine on nuclear 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubinin and others said the Ukrainian move should smooth negotiations that 
began Wednesday on other thorny Russian-Ukrainian problems, including dividing 
the Black Sea Fleet and payment of Ukraine's huge energy debt to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 The move allows the United States, Russia and Ukraine to begin downsizing 
their bloated post-Cold War nuclear arsenals. Moscow has refused to implement 
the strategic arms reduction treaty START I, which would cut its nuclear 
stockpile by a third, until Ukraine joined the non-proliferation treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1968 pact, which is up for extension next spring, recognizes only five 
official nuclear powers: the United States, the United Kingdom, France, China 
and what was once the Soviet Union. Now four of the 15 former Soviet republics 
-- Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus -- are nuclear powers, although 
Kazakhstan and Belarus have already relinquished all claims to the weapons and 
agreed to dismantle them. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as Ukrainian lawmakers ratified the non-proliferation treaty, they 
attached six qualifications and explanations, stating that the pact "does not 
fully deal with the situation of a nuclear state -- the Soviet Union -- 
collapsing." 
</P>
<P>
 They also stated that the mere presence of nuclear weapons on Ukrainian 
territory does not violate the treaty -- an apparent claim to the warheads 
until the day they are dismantled, leaving no room for Russia to try to regain 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We own nuclear weapons," Kuchma told an unusually silent chamber. "But we 
don't control them." 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, Russia has launch control over the missiles and could 
theoretically fire them without Ukrainian consent. However, Moscow has pledged 
to honor a veto from Kiev on their use. 
</P>
<P>
 An agreement signed by Russia, the United States and Ukraine in January 
committed Ukraine to rid itself of all its warheads within seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Kuchma reminded the deputies that an unpublished side agreement 
between Ukraine and Russia last spring committed Ukraine to transfer the 
warheads to Russia within 2 1/2 years in exchange for fuel for nuclear power 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those caught up in the passions of false patriotism should remember that 
Ukraine can't make nuclear weapons, and it can't even use the warheads it 
inherited," Kuchma said. "Just creating a system for safely maintaining the 
weapons it has would cost $10 billion to $30 billion." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchma once headed the giant factory that produced missiles, and he opposed 
the treaty until he was elected president in July. Lawmakers apparently were 
impressed by his conversion to the disarmament cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Kuchma talks nukes, lawmakers listen," parliamentary adviser Petro 
Matiaszek said. In the end, with $4 billion in promised Western aid in the 
balance, Kuchma told lawmakers that further delay would be unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no choice," the president said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukraine's access to world markets for its space launchers had been blocked 
because it had not joined the non-proliferation treaty. Now, the 
technology-minded Kuchma expects to sign a space cooperation agreement with the 
United States during his visit next week. 
</P>
<P>
 To sweeten the pie, Kuchma's trip was bumped up from simply an official visit 
to a state visit, complete with a white-tie dinner rare for the Clinton 
Administration.

 Ukrainian officials have delighted in telling reporters that only Russian 
President Boris N. Yeltsin has been so honored by the Clinton White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a triumph for Ukrainian diplomacy and Ukrainian independence," 
Foreign Minister Hennady Udovenko said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just hours before the vote, Ukrainian officials announced that they had 
achieved final agreement on security guarantees from the United States, Russia, 
Britain and France. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders of the four nuclear powers and Ukraine are expected to sign a 
document to that effect at a meeting in Budapest, Hungary, in early December. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the security guarantees compel the nuclear four only to consult 
one another if Ukraine is attacked; they do not oblige the Western nations to 
defend Ukraine militarily.

MTA APPROVES OVERHAUL OF VALLEY'S BUS SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the most sweeping overhaul of the San Fernando Valley's bus system in 20 
years, transportation officials agreed Wednesday to reroute and cancel some 
lines to streamline service and to establish transit bases that will connect 
buses with employment centers, train stations and subway stops. 
</P>
<P>
 By June of next year, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will revamp 
two dozen bus lines that serve about 5,200 riders throughout the Valley, from 
Warner Center in Woodland Hills to the foothill communities in the Valley's 
northeastern corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Underused routes will be canceled or absorbed into other lines. Several routes 
will shift onto main streets or be extended to serve major job centers in 
response to longtime criticism that buses do not go where people want or link 
together sensibly. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes form the first phase of an ambitious plan to dot the rim of the 
Valley with transit nodes where passengers can transfer between buses or switch 
to rail travel more easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in December, 1995, the MTA hopes to install transit bases at Warner 
Center, Cal State Northridge, the planned Universal City subway stop and the 
Chatsworth, Sylmar/San Fernando and Burbank Metrolink train stations. According 
to the restructuring plan, bus lines will radiate from the centers in a 
"hub-and-spoke" pattern -- a departure from the traditional grid system of 
north-south and east-west routes that has prevailed in the Valley since the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 New routes will allow passengers to travel within Valley neighborhoods on a 
single bus, without many of the confusing transfers now necessary to change 
directions on the grid. Smaller, more frequent shuttles, modeled after the 
city's DASH system, will make short hops within communities, although important 
details still need to be worked out before shuttle service can begin in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to figure out how to do it -- who's going to operate it, who's 
going to fund it," said Mark R. Dierking, the MTA's manager of government and 
public affairs for northern Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line," he said, "is to improve service." 
</P>
<P>
 Adoption of the wide-ranging innovations caps a five-year discussion on how 
best to reconfigure the Valley's 64 bus lines, which move 150,000 people daily 
and cover nearly a quarter of the MTA's entire operating area countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 Combatting what they saw as official neglect, Valley advocates and community 
leaders convened to discuss ways to improve a transit system left practically 
untouched for two decades. Last year, city and county agencies commissioned a 
$500,000 report that went over Valley bus service line by line and produced the 
recommendations approved Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The study was a microstudy of the system that we're rarely able to do," 
Dierking said. 
</P>
<P>
 Planners suggested integrating bus and rail centers and better coordinating 
schedules often developed without regard for connecting different lines. At the 
six transit centers to be established throughout the Valley, "timed transfers" 
will synchronize arrivals and departures to eliminate long waits. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the transit centers, the MTA plans to upgrade 20 local bus 
stops by building improved shelters with direct telephone access to the MTA for 
passengers to report problems or receive route and scheduling information. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some elements of the restructuring plan -- such as the upgraded stops 
and the community shuttle service -- will require a sizable amount of money, 
officials believe the restructuring plan will save the cash-strapped MTA about 
$4 million a year, mostly through shedding lesser-used routes and contracting 
out operation of some lines. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the MTA board directed planners to look for ways to further cut 
costs and to report back next month. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the agency will hold a formal public hearing in Van Nuys on the 
new plan, with any modifications to be made in time for the MTA to begin the 
first phase of the project by April. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the areas most heavily targeted for improved service was Warner Center, 
which 20 years ago consisted mainly of the Topanga Plaza shopping center and 
the nearby Rocketdyne facility. The area has since become one of the Valley's 
busiest commercial centers, with high-rise office buildings and a cluster of 
new apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing its importance, the MTA has designated the neighborhood as the 
terminus for the east-west Valley subway system to be built over the next 25 
years. Officials also chose it as the site of one of the transit nodes to be 
installed under the restructuring plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Warner Center is one center in the Valley that has kind of grown into a hub," 
said Irwin Rosenberg, a vice president with Laidlaw Transit Services, a private 
bus company. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg's firm currently runs some of the city's DASH buses around Warner 
Center, including commuter services during rush hour and midday shuttles within 
the neighborhood. Because so much traffic radiates from the area, Rosenberg 
said a hub-and-spoke pattern of bus lines as outlined in the MTA plan makes 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
 The current system "hasn't really met transportation needs," he said. "The 
assumption is that folks only go north-south (and) east-west, and the 
assumption isn't always right." Bus Route Changes

CARPENTER'S EXTRADITION CALLED IMMINENT; CRIME: FEDERAL AUTHORITIES HOPE TO 
RETURN FORMER SENATOR -- WHO FLED SENTENCING ON CORRUPTION CHARGES -- FROM 
COSTA RICA BY FRIDAY. HE IS SEEKING A DELAY FOR CANCER SURGERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ex-state Sen. Paul Carpenter, who fled to Costa Rica after his conviction on 
political corruption charges, has apparently exhausted his legal appeals and 
could be extradited to California by the end of the week, federal authorities 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Carpenter, who is suffering from advanced prostate cancer, has asked 
the Costa Rican courts for a delay in his extradition, saying that he requires 
emergency surgery for his condition. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Marshal's office was preparing to pick up the former Democratic 
legislator Wednesday, but because of the latest legal and medical complications 
held off sending marshals to the Costa Rican capital of San Jose, where 
Carpenter has been jailed since April. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not aware of any medical emergency," Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal Mike 
Nelson said. "I know that he wants to have an operation down there . . . to 
prevent the spread of the cancer. I don't know if the courts will allow that to 
happen. If it does happen, it would probably mean a delay." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, U.S. Atty. Charles J. Stevens expressed confidence that 
Carpenter would finally be returned to the United States to face sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Costa Rica have "basically told us that this thing is over, that 
there is no further appeal for Carpenter," said Stevens, who was hoping that 
Carpenter would be returned to the United States by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens emphasized that the U.S. government would assure Carpenter of proper 
medical attention for his cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one disputes the fact that he has prostate cancer at this stage and 
probably needs additional medical attention when he returns to the U.S.," 
Stevens said, adding that the U.S. prison system could provide him with better 
medical treatment than he has been receiving in Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter's former lawyer, Charles F. Bloodgood, confirmed that the onetime 
California politician had exhausted his appeals in the Costa Rican courts but 
was asking for a delay so that he could have surgery to treat his condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past several months, Carpenter's health has been precarious. He was 
hospitalized for six weeks when he underwent surgery to remove a benign tumor 
blocking his colon, Bloodgood said. Initially, Costa Rican authorities insisted 
that Carpenter be handcuffed to his hospital bed. Eventually the local courts 
ordered him unshackled, ruling that handcuffing was cruel and unusual 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 The court awarded the fugitive political figure damages for the treatment, but 
Carpenter refused the money, Bloodgood said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter was first convicted on corruption charges in 1990 and was sentenced 
to 12 years in prison for extorting campaign contributions from those seeking 
help with legislation, including an undercover FBI agent who was part of an 
elaborate sting operation. 
</P>
<P>
 That conviction was overturned because of faulty jury instructions. However, 
Carpenter, a former member of the state Board of Equalization, was indicted and 
convicted on separate criminal charges in 1993, along with Capitol lobbyist 
Clayton R. Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he could be sentenced in February, Carpenter fled the country, leaving 
a note saying that he was seeking "a more adventuristic" treatment for his 
terminal cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 In the handwritten note to federal Judge Edward J. Garcia, Carpenter 
explained: "I find my drive for survival stronger than my sense of obligation 
to your legal system." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after he arrived in Costa Rica, Carpenter was located by U.S. authorities 
and jailed pending his extradition. In a jailhouse interview, Carpenter told a 
reporter for the Sacramento Bee that he would rather die in a Costa Rican 
prison than be sentenced in California. "You cannot go home again," he said, 
"even to die."

NEW APPOINTEE NAMED CHAIRMAN OF COASTAL PANEL; POLITICS: SOME MEMBERS ALLEGE 
BACK-ROOM DEAL IN CHOICE OF EMBATTLED SPEAKER WILLIE BROWN'S ALLY. BOARD LATER 
OKS CONTROVERSIAL GAVIOTA DEVELOPMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Amid allegations of back-room dealing, an appointee of embattled Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) was seated on the California Coastal 
Commission and immediately named chairman Wednesday, only hours before the 
panel approved a controversial development on the Santa Barbara County coast. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco attorney Carl Williams was elected chairman over the objections 
of four appointees of the Senate Rules Committee, who said someone who has not 
served on the 12-member panel should not be elevated to the top post. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel, said Commissioner Garry Giacomini, was "horribly tainted" by the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 The action was an opening battle in the post-election struggle that is 
expected to occur as Brown fights to retain his speakership and, with it, 
powers to appoint members to powerful state bodies, including the Coastal 
Commission, which oversees development along 1,100 miles of shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's session at times degenerated into prolonged and occasionally 
rancorous debate, even though Vice Chairman Louis Calcagno had cautioned his 
fellow commissioners against "washing our laundry in public." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams won the chairmanship through an alliance of the four commissioners 
appointed by Brown and the four named by Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative of the governor said the Wilson appointees were 
philosophically in tune with the Brown appointees in their approach to coastal 
development issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday evening, the commission voted 8 to 2 to approve two golf courses on 
Santa Barbara County's Gaviota coastline, over the objection of the 
commission's staff and representatives of environmental and surfing 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission Executive Director Peter Douglas warned at the outset of a long 
discussion that conversion of the 200-acre coastal property, 10 miles west of 
Goleta, would set "a very adverse precedent." The commission had rejected the 
project earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't protect agricultural lands by putting a golf course on it," Douglas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But representatives of Arco Oil and Gas Co., the land's owner, said that 
development of the $10-million Dos Pueblos golf courses -- one 18 holes, the 
other nine -- would increase public use of the land and provide beach access 
for surfers and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Steven H. Kaufmann disputed the Coastal Commission staff's position 
that the property is agricultural land. "It's an existing oil field," he said, 
that produced 3,000 barrels a month last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Brennan, deputy secretary of the state Business, Transportation and 
Housing Agency, told commissioners that maintaining the agricultural zoning on 
land that had not been farmed for years was not fair to Arco. In supporting the 
project, the Wilson Administration representative said, "Golf courses are 
pretty nice pieces of property." 
</P>
<P>
 However, environmentalists, some carrying "Save Our Coast" signs, said the 
project would hurt one of the last relatively undeveloped stretches of 
coastline in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Krop, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Center in Santa 
Barbara, said the Arco project would "only pave the way for further development 
of this rural coast" that extends from the edge of Santa Barbara to Gaviota. 
</P>
<P>
 Giacomini, whose family owned dairy farms in western Marin County for 
generations, argued against the Arco project, warning that it would mark the 
"beginning of the end of the Gaviota coast" by breaking down agricultural 
zoning and creating a domino effect for future development. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Giacomini accused Brown appointee David Malcolm of working 
aggressively Tuesday night to line up votes for Williams who, like his 
predecessor, is African American. Giacomini said Malcolm was making both direct 
and veiled threats that the Arco project would be defeated if Williams was not 
elected chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Malcolm, who nominated Williams and pressed for his election, said Giacomini 
was "so far out of line" that he was not even going to rebut his allegation. 
Later, he said the suggestion of a linkage to the Arco project was "garbage." 
</P>
<P>
 Giacomini and three other Senate Rules appointees sought to break up the 
Brown-Wilson alliance by trying to nominate three Wilson appointees as 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams resigned as head of the San Francisco Housing Authority in 1985 after 
6 1/2 years amid disclosures that the agency was almost $6 million in debt. 
</P>
<P>
 On the coastal panel, he replaces Thomas W. Gwyn, another Brown appointee who 
was elected chairman at his first commission meeting in February, 1990.

INDIAN CASINOS NOT READY TO REMOVE SLOTS; GAMBLING: TRIBAL ATTORNEYS VOW APPEAL 
OF RESTRICTION ON GAMES. ONE PROSECUTOR SAYS HE WON'T FORCE REMOVAL OF MACHINES 
UNTIL RESOLUTION OF ALL ISSUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It has not been a good two weeks for the Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, or 
for other California tribes that have banked their futures on casinos. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the tribes contributed more than $1 million to the Democratic Party 
only to have their gubernatorial candidate, Democrat Kathleen Brown, crushed by 
the man they see as their archenemy, Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the Wilson 
Administration in the long legal showdown over the tribes' use of lucrative 
video slot machines, ruling that the state could not be forced to accept types 
of gambling that are illegal for others in California. 
</P>
<P>
 So there was some sense of doom Wednesday in the Native American communities 
that dot the state's landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will hurt us tremendously," said Norma Manzano, former chairwoman of the 
San Manuel Band of Mission Indians in San Bernardino. "The casino revenue -- 
the money from the machines -- was our source of revenue." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet on Wednesday, a day after the long-awaited appellate ruling, few were 
predicting any immediate unplugging of the thousands of beeping, flashing 
machines that have changed the face of gambling in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Tribal attorneys promised appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court and vowed to 
convince the courts that they did not introduce video slots to California -- 
that the state's own lottery beat them to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the top federal prosecutor in San Diego, one of the hotbeds of 
tribal gambling -- with three casinos housing 3,000 of the video devices -- 
offered reassurances Wednesday that he would not force removal of machines that 
cause "no irreparable harm" until all legal issues are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Cabazon Reservation, home of the most aggressive tribe in the state, 
leaders were far from panicking over the setbacks, which Chairman John James 
conceded means the state "got the aces waiting for us." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is frustrating, but we will win in the long run," James said as a midday 
throng of gamblers continued to slide $20 bills into the video slots at the 
recently expanded and renamed Fantasy Springs Casino. 
</P>
<P>
 The tribes may have been left with a weaker hand over the last two weeks, but 
that of Wilson and state Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren has been strengthened. Lungren 
won reelection despite $800,000 in contributions from tribes to his Democratic 
opponent, Tom Umberg. The Cabazon gave $250,000 to the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 During a period when gambling has expanded rapidly in many states -- not 
merely on Indian lands, but on riverboats and in resort areas -- Wilson and 
Lungren have fought to prevent California from joining this modern-day Gold 
Rush. 
</P>
<P>
 Both have called for a state gambling commission, largely to regulate the 
growing number of card clubs, and they have also refused to negotiate gambling 
compacts with tribes that they say flout state law by installing electronic 
gambling machines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remain emphatically opposed to the proliferation of casino gaming in this 
state," Wilson said in a blunt Sept. 30 statement sent to members of the 
Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the tribes refuse to abide by the law now, the people of California can 
have little faith that they will comply with the terms of a negotiated compact 
later," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's 3-0 opinion, issued in San Francisco, upheld his position, stating 
that "the state of California had no obligation to negotiate with Indian tribes 
on certain proposed gaming activities" -- namely those forms of gambling 
"others cannot have." 
</P>
<P>
 One issue was remanded to a Sacramento trial court, however: what games the 
tribes might be allowed as equivalent of the state's own "video lottery 
terminals." 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, tribal attorneys took an expansive view of that opening and said 
they will continue to make the argument that the state's keno game and other 
technology available to the lottery are the equivalent of the poker machines 
and other video slots. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tribes feel pretty comfortable that all they're asking for is what the 
state lottery is authorized to do," said Sacramento attorney Howard Dickstein, 
who represents five tribes, including the lead plaintiff in the case in 
question, the Rumsey Rancheria. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a definitive ruling," Dickstein said of the 9th Circuit opinion. 
(And) I feel confident that the status quo" -- active casinos -- "will be 
maintained pending some definitive ruling." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lungren embraced the ruling as a repudiation of the tribes' broad argument 
that the state, by sanctioning several types of wagering -- including the 
lottery -- had established a general public policy that made it hypocritical to 
oppose full casino gambling by tribes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The attorney general stated pretty clearly he doesn't expect the gambling to 
go on. It's illegal," Lungren spokesman David Puglia said. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Indian Gaming Commission lists 23 tribes with gambling facilities 
in California, generating an estimated $1 billion a year in revenue. State 
officials say that could rise dramatically, however, because there are 45 
pending applications for gambling compacts and many other small Native American 
groups are seeking federal recognition -- perhaps to start gambling operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittier law professor I. Nelson Rose, an expert on gambling, said that any 
prohibition on the gambling machines could "put a damper" on plans by major 
casino companies to build showpiece facilities on tribal lands in California 
because the limited gambling would cut profits in half. 
</P>
<P>
 But the attorney for the Agua Caliente band said the ruling will have no 
effect on the most high-profile project, construction of a Caesars World casino 
in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Art Bunce said the $25-million casino "will open as a Class II 
facility," meaning without Las Vegas-level gambling, "with the hope and 
expectation that, before long, (it) will be available." 
</P>
<P>
 Of greater immediate concern to the Agua Caliente, he said, is a lawsuit by 
the state contesting the right of Palm Springs to transfer lands to the tribe 
to help put together the downtown casino site. 
</P>
<P>
 As tribal and city officials prepared to meet to discuss a response to the 
state's lawsuit, Bunce emphasized that the tribe still plans on building the 
Caesars facility -- even if it means moving it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might still be in Palm Springs, or in Cathedral City, where there are 
3,000 acres of reservation land, or Rancho Mirage, where there are 800 acres of 
reservation, or on 17,000 acres of unincorporated land in Riverside County," 
Bunce said, adding that the casino will open within 18 months, offering games 
now permissible in California, such as poker, off-track betting and bingo. 
</P>
<P>
 In Indio, Cabazon officials said they never would have earned close to the $60 
million brought in last year were it not for 500-plus electronic gambling 
machines. But they promised to comply with any final ruling of the U.S. Supreme 
Court -- where their the tiny band won the first landmark case in Indian 
gambling, giving tribes the right to offer bingo games without the limits on 
prizes imposed on nonprofit groups and charities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have gone crazy and brought in 15,000 machines, and gone hog-wild," 
said Chairman James. "But we'll play by the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Cabazon's chief executive officer, Mark Nichols, said gamblers probably will 
balk if the tribes lose their machines because "we offer much better return for 
the players. The state's games have worse odds and less prizes." 
</P>
<P>
 With their long -- and largely successful -- experience with the legal system, 
tribes like the Cabazon are finding it tougher to deal with last week's 
election than the subsequent court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the state will be emboldened by the political changes," said attorney 
Dickstein, citing a Tuesday hearing on gambling issues in Sacramento, at which 
the tribes "as usual (became) the scapegoat for society's problems." 
</P>
<P>
 At the hearing, representatives of card rooms complained that tribes had 
unfair advantages -- and asked for the right to conduct the same games. A horse 
racing group blamed tribal casinos for slumping performances in their field. 
And state Sen. Ken Maddy (R-Fresno) called for a campaign to get Congress to 
amend the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to make it harder for tribes to annex 
land off their reservations for casinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddy, a supporter of horse racing interests, said he hopes the state's 
position "may find a better reception" in Congress now that there is a 
Republican majority. 
</P>
<P>
 But some tribal leaders found humor amid the setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabazon's James said his tribe now hopes Gov. Wilson will run for President in 
1996 -- to get him out of the governor's mansion. "Gray Davis can run for 
governor in two years, and we'll back him," James said.

ART ATTACK; LAGUNA BEACH KEEPS CLEARING AWAY COLLAGE OF NATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To some observers, the colorful swirl of flowers, branches and berries that 
Joe Mangrum has created on Main Beach is, well, just a colorful swirl of 
flowers, branches and berries. 
</P>
<P>
 But to Mangrum, his piece of "public art" -- which he meticulously assembles 
by day only to have city cleaning crews sweep away by night -- has come to 
symbolize the struggle of creativity against rigid bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The artwork in question was conceived as Mangrum's protest against 
construction of the San Joaquin Hills tollway through Laguna Canyon, a project 
that has inflamed emotions in this coastal community. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, his pique has been redirected toward the city, which informed him 
Wednesday that he must obtain a permit and a $1-million liability insurance 
policy to keep his artwork at Main Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also told him he would have to move his nine-foot circle of nature 
from its grassy perch to a nearby cobblestone area designated for displays of 
free expression. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think it's a ridiculous idea to have to have insurance to politically 
protest," he said Wednesday as pigeons pecked at his masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, there is a certain spiritual benefit to his suffering: "I think the 
more the city destroys it, the stronger the piece becomes." 
</P>
<P>
 From the city's perspective, this isn't so much about art as keeping city 
parks and beaches tidy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if it was a Van Gogh painting, our Municipal Services (Department) 
people would pick up that painting and remove it from the beach," recreation 
director Pat Barry said. "He wants to leave something there overnight and have 
me guarantee it will be there the next morning. I simply cannot do that." 
</P>
<P>
 The saga began last week when Mangrum, a traveling "environmental artist," 
began collecting twigs, kumquats, feathers and other bits of nature that caught 
his eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the weekend, he fitted the pieces together on the highly visible patch of 
grass at Main Beach, a city-owned park. 
</P>
<P>
 When he returned Monday morning to again behold his creation, it was gone, 
cleared away by city groundskeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted, he set to work again, and by Tuesday morning, the area was again 
wiped clean. 
</P>
<P>
 After investing 100 hours in his project, he was fed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Mangrum, 25, complained to the City Council on Tuesday night and was 
encouraged to talk to Barry. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the two did not share a meeting of the minds. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry suggested that Mangrum keep re-creating his artwork at the beach each 
day or get an outdoor exhibit permit and display his piece at the Irvine Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mangrum, who said he has a bachelor's degree from the School of the Art 
Institute of Chicago, said his art is "very site specific." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who gathered Wednesday to gaze upon Mangrum's palette of blossoms, 
branches, sand and sea shells seemed to approve. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's really sharp," Laguna Beach resident Jim Hohn said. "I think 
they should probably just leave him alone and let him do it."

LAST-MINUTE GOP DONATIONS TIPPED KEY ASSEMBLY RACES; POLITICS: REPUBLICAN 
PARTY, PHILIP MORRIS AND POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEES CHANGED BALANCE IN SEVERAL 
CONTESTS, LOOSENING BROWN'S HOLD ON SPEAKERSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On the eve of the Nov. 8 election, Democrats, already anxious about the 
reelection chances of first-term Assemblywoman Betty Karnette of Long Beach, 
saw an ominous sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacks bulging with mail from her Republican opponent, Rancho Palos Verdes City 
Mayor Steve Kuykendall, began arriving at post offices for delivery to voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The last-minute mailings, underwritten with a $125,000 contribution from 
tobacco giant Philip Morris U.S.A., helped tip a close election in Kuykendall's 
favor and may end Democrat Willie Brown's record 14-year Assembly speakership. 
</P>
<P>
 That the tobacco industry would deliver the fatal blow is a strange irony. Few 
political leaders in the past decade have taken more money from the tobacco 
industry than Brown, who received more than $400,000. In 1991-92, he received 
$220,000, more than any other politician during that time, according to a study 
by UC San Francisco researcher Stanton Glantz. Brown has attended the Kentucky 
Derby as a guest of a tobacco company, and in his private law practice has 
counseled a company with major tobacco holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 If Kuykendall holds his narrow lead when all absentee ballots are counted, 
Republicans are expected to emerge with a 41-39 edge in the 80-member lower 
house. Trying somehow to hang onto the speakership, Brown has called an unusual 
session for today of the lame-duck Assembly, where Democrats maintain a 47-33 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Morris gambled by crossing Brown (D-San Francisco). But the firm's 
infusion of cash was also a show of special interest strength, and Philip 
Morris was not alone in contributing campaign money in a handful of close 
Assembly races the GOP won, tipping the balance of power away from Democrats 
and to Republicans for the first time since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 Gun owners and the state prison guards union influenced other tight races. A 
far-right political action committee also spent heavily on GOP candidates. 
Taken together, the donations show how big money given late in the campaign 
influenced close contests at a time when voters are increasingly unfamiliar 
with short-term incumbents who are turning over faster than ever because of 
voter-imposed term limits and the effects of the 1991 reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although last-minute special interest contributions were important, there were 
other factors as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has long been considered a master strategist, but his last-minute 
fund-raising prowess failed to match that of Assembly Republican Leader Jim 
Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga, and Brulte is now on the verge of unseating Brown 
as Speaker of what will be a closely divided house. 
</P>
<P>
 Realizing Democrats' vulnerability in the final days before the election, 
Republicans poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into swing districts, 
leaving the Speaker unable to match the spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's money problems were compounded by the GOP tide that swept the state 
and country, and his party's general opposition to Proposition 187, the popular 
anti-illegal immigration measure. Also, in some races, especially in a strong 
Democratic seat centered around Salinas, Democrats seem to have taken victory 
for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats were also plagued by abysmally low voter turnouts, particularly 
among blacks, and top of the ticket candidates Dianne Feinstein and Kathleen 
Brown attracting money that otherwise would have gone to Assembly Democratic 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 With Karnette's apparent defeat, four Democratic incumbent Assembly members 
will have lost. Four other seats previously held by Democrats went to 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican victory even surprised Brulte. "We thought it was possible to 
get to 41 or 42 (in the Assembly) if everything broke right, but we didn't 
anticipate it," he said. Still, he said, "15 days out, I made the decision that 
we would go for broke." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, he said, "it was my gut instinct" change was coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte's gambit earned the respect of Bill Cavala, a top Brown campaign 
deputy, who said he was surprised by the money that flowed to GOP candidates in 
the final days. He praised the way Brulte allocated his money to campaigns and 
"took some gambles," especially against Karnette. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte said he did not solicit Philip Morris' $125,000 donation to Kuykendall, 
but knew it was coming a month before the money arrived. The Philip Morris 
money allowed Brulte to spend his money elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Morris executive David Laufer told The Times that the donation was 
aimed not at deposing Brown but specifically at Karnette, who voted against 
tobacco repeatedly during her one Assembly term. 
</P>
<P>
 "We contributed because we opposed the incumbent," Laufer said. "It was the 
incumbent we were opposing." 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats say Philip Morris was attempting to send a message to any legislator 
who favors anti-smoking legislation. Kuykendall said Philip Morris officials 
knew he supported the Rancho Palos Verdes' resolution opposing Proposition 188, 
the tobacco industry's effort to overturn local and state smoking restrictions, 
and voted for the city's ban on smoking in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuykendall, who admitted that his campaign was strapped for money, said: 
"(Philip Morris) wanted Willie Brown gone as Speaker. They have reasons to want 
a better business environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Morris, however, was not alone in underwriting campaigns. Brulte dumped 
nearly $1.5 million into Republican Assembly races -- almost all of it coming 
in the final weeks of the election -- and the Republican Party spent several 
hundred thousand more on direct mail and a strong effort to get out the vote. 
In all, Republicans raised $3.5 million for the Assembly races. 
</P>
<P>
 Paralleling this effort, the conservative Allied Business Political Action 
Committee spent almost $300,000 in the final month on Republican Assembly 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Gale Kaufman, the Assembly Democrat's campaign director, said Brown "wasn't in 
(the campaigns) with as many players. He didn't have an Allied Business PAC . . 
. to write a big check." 
</P>
<P>
 In past elections, she said, Brown was able to tap the California Teachers 
Assn. or veteran Democratic Assembly members. But the CTA spent heavily to 
defeat Proposition 187, and was strapped because it spent $13 million to defeat 
a school voucher initiative last year. Additionally, many Assembly Democrats 
who were proven fund-raisers for Brown were retiring or moving up to the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) also made a strong pitch for 
money, as he successfully sought to hold Democratic control of the upper house. 
The net result was that money was siphoned from Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said Proposition 187 had as much to do with the Democrat losses as 
anything on the ballot. He said Brulte told him that GOP polling showed that 
voters had a favorable impression of Democratic candidates, but when told the 
Democrats in question opposed the initiative there would "be a 20-30 point 
flip." 
</P>
<P>
 One major surprise for Democrats was the 28th Assembly District, the so-called 
Steinbeck seat because stories of novelist John Steinbeck were set around 
Salinas. Although polls privately showed Democrat Lily Cervantes, a member of 
the Coastal Commission, in trouble, legislators failed to provide her with much 
money or mount a street-level campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Another close race was in the 56th Assembly District, a suburban and 
blue-collar area that for two decades has swung between Democrats and 
Republicans. Assemblyman Bob Epple (D-Cerritos) lost to Republican Phil Hawkins 
in a rematch of their close 1992 contest. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Brulte's $345,000, John Stoos of the Gun Owners of California 
said gun groups gave $40,000 to Hawkins, adding that Epple was his "No. 1 
target." Epple incurred gun owners' wrath by voting to limit the size of 
firearms magazines. "That was pay-back for him," Stoos said, adding that with 
the turnover in the Assembly he now counts 46 pro-gun votes, compared to 37 
before the election.

 Times staff writers Carl Ingram in Sacramento and Ted Johnson in Torrance

CAPITOL JOURNAL: FOR WILSON, NEW FRIENDS IN HIGH PLACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson is rested, relaxed and ready for Washington -- not as a 
wanna-be President, but as a newly empowered Republican seeking help in 
implementing Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally a workaholic, the governor celebrated his lopsided, come-from-behind 
reelection victory last weekend by just hanging around the house and going out 
to a movie ("Clear and Present Danger"). On Sunday, he was a couch potato glued 
to the TV, watching his favorite NFL team, the San Diego Chargers, nip the 
Kansas City Chiefs in a 14-13 thriller. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been laying low and recharging after a grueling campaign. But today he 
flies to Washington to deliver a new California message, born of the 187 fight: 
"California is not simply a colony to be taxed to pay for federal failure." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also is taking along other pithy sound bites for TV bookings, a speech 
to the conservative Heritage Foundation and a conference of victorious GOP 
governors in Williamsburg, Va. Such as: "It's time for the federal government 
to get off our backs and out of our pockets." "Washington should hear 
California's call and wake up." "Set the states free." 
</P>
<P>
 And, "We must unleash government in the service of those who work hard, pay 
their taxes and obey the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Such rhetoric is sure to tantalize pundits and politicos into further 
conjecture about a 1996 presidential bid. Wilson publicly has ruled that out 
and refuses to discuss it, apparently believing any additional comments merely 
would escalate the speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 If somebody presses him, as I did Tuesday, he may say: "I just won the job I 
was seeking and am looking forward to doing it." For four years? "Yeah." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The governor especially is looking forward to doing his job now that fellow 
Republicans are about to seize control of Congress and the state Assembly. 
Indeed, the most important part of his Washington trip for California will be 
two private meetings with the incoming congressional leaders: Rep. Newt 
Gingrich of Georgia and Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson will urge Gingrich and Dole to push for de facto congressional 
implementation of Proposition 187. This could be done, he says, by passing 
legislation eliminating the federal requirement that states educate and provide 
public services for illegal immigrants. The initiative's fate still would be 
decided by the courts. But Wilson thinks implementation could be expedited and 
California's case strengthened by congressional action. 
</P>
<P>
 He particularly has in mind schools. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled narrowly in 
1982 that states must educate undocumented immigrants, but its decision was 
based, in part, on an absence of "identifiable congressional policy." 
</P>
<P>
 If Congress did free states from educating illegal immigrants and also 
eliminate mandates for other services, President Clinton could veto the 
legislation. But, Wilson notes, "the President would have to think very long 
and very hard" about angering California's electorate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, for him, the legislation would be a blessing in disguise," the 
governor says. "He has to relieve California of the costs of illegal 
immigration or he doesn't stand a prayer of carrying this state in '96. And if 
Congress makes it easy for him, that's a gift." 
</P>
<P>
 In a Republican Congress, relief from mandates -- not an infusion of money -- 
is likely to be the preferred mode of help for illegal immigration, along with 
a more secure border and swifter deportations. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also will lobby the GOP leaders for relaxation of welfare mandates, 
giving the states more flexibility to run their own programs. He strongly 
advocates a time limit on welfare for able-bodied adults. 
</P>
<P>
 And he says "part of the calculus of welfare reform" should be shifting 
recipients into jobs -- such as dishwashing -- now held by illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson may be relaxed, but he's still easily riled at the mention of 187's 
opposition campaign. He spews words such as "scare tactics," "disgraceful" and 
"bogus." Claiming that teachers will have to turn in suspected illegal 
immigrants, the governor says, is "CTA bull----." 
</P>
<P>
 "A great many (Latinos) have been poisoned by the most remarkable hype I've 
ever seen," he says. "For a lot of people who feel this really was a racist 
thing, I guess they now believe that the people of California are racists by (a 
vote of) 3 to 2. And they're not." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, he theorizes, many Latinos after being "browbeat and told that 
this was an evil, immoral thing" still voted for 187, but lied to the 
pollsters. 
</P>
<P>
 And as for school administrators or any other public officials who refuse to 
enforce 187 once it takes effect, he says, "they ought to have their butts 
fired." 
</P>
<P>
 The triumphant Marine is back. And he now has Republican friends in powerful 
places.

COALITION GOVERNMENT IN IRELAND FALLS APART; POLITICS: A JUDICIAL APPOINTMENT 
BY PRIME MINISTER SPURRED COLLAPSE. IT IS NOT EXPECTED TO AFFECT ULSTER 
CEASE-FIRE DIRECTLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ireland's coalition government collapsed Wednesday night, just as it was 
making strides toward peace in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Prime Minister Dick Spring, head of the Labor Party, announced that he 
and six Labor members of Prime Minister Albert Reynolds' Cabinet were 
resigning. Further, Spring declared that his 32-member party will cast ballots 
against Reynolds in a parliamentary vote of confidence scheduled for today -- 
which would formally end the government coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neither I nor any of my colleagues can vote confidence in this government," 
Spring said. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure of the government -- the result of a dispute over a judicial 
appointment -- had no roots in the Northern Ireland peace process and is not 
expected to directly affect the recent cease-fire that ended 25 years of 
sectarian violence in the province. 
</P>
<P>
 However, political observers noted that Sinn Fein, the political arm of 
Northern Ireland's outlawed Irish Republican Army, has been closer over the 
years to Reynolds' party, Fianna Fail, than to the leading opposition party, 
Fine Gael. 
</P>
<P>
 Sinn Fein said late Wednesday that it regretted the failure of the Irish 
government and will continue to work with all parties toward a lasting peace. 
</P>
<P>
 After today's expected no-confidence vote, President Mary Robinson will decide 
whether to call new national elections or ask the various party leaders whether 
they can form a new government. 
</P>
<P>
 The crisis could last several days or longer while party leaders negotiate, 
because most politicians oppose new elections since the Fianna Fail-Labor 
government is less than 2 years old. Coalition wrangling had already dragged on 
for weeks after recent national elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Spring's resignation came after the most dramatic and confusing parliamentary 
session in memory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Party leader effectively accused Reynolds of lying in a statement to 
the Parliament on Tuesday about his controversial appointment of former Atty. 
Gen. Harry Whelehan as president of the High Court, a post similar to that of 
chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The immediate crisis began with Reynolds' decision last week to name Whelehan 
to the post -- a decision opposed by his Labor coalition partners because they 
considered Whelehan's record far too conservative on social issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, Labor argued, Whelehan took seven months to decide that a Roman 
Catholic priest should be extradited to Northern Ireland on charges of child 
abuse -- possibly for political reasons, his opponents suggested. The priest, 
Father Brendan Smyth, has since been jailed in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 Whelehan was also involved in prohibiting a 14-year-old rape victim from going 
to England for an abortion in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, an autocratic leader, insisted on pushing through Whelehan's 
appointment in the face of massive opposition, and he attempted to explain his 
action in Wednesday's parliamentary session. 
</P>
<P>
 But his performance was bumbling and marked by pleas for adjournment while he 
reconsidered his position. Finally, he admitted that Whelehan had been less 
than frank with him in explaining the extradition delay and said the 
reservations of the Labor Party coalition partners were "fully justified." 
</P>
<P>
 In Dublin, there was speculation that President Robinson will ask Spring to 
consider forming a coalition with the center-right Fine Gael party under its 
leader, John Bruton, or with Fianna Fail under someone other than Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
 Political observers said that despite Reynolds' ineptitude as a coalition 
leader, he has been pivotal in the Northern Ireland peace effort, particularly 
in building bridges to Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds pressed British Prime Minister John Major to hasten the peace process 
by accepting the current Northern Ireland cease-fire as permanent and to begin 
all-party talks, even with those representing paramilitary groups. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, one Foreign Office official said of the Dublin developments: "The 
Downing Street Declaration which started the peace process is between the 
British and Irish governments -- not between particular leaders."

 Defense Secretary William J. Perry announced Wednesday that U.S. military 
reserve and National Guard positions will be cut by 39,900 next year to a total 
of 996,100. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry said some troops will be able to transfer to other units near their 
homes. The reduction is part of post-Cold War defense cuts that also aim to 
trim regular full-time military forces to 1.4 million.

PALESTINIAN PRISONERS STILL ABUSED, ISRAELI GROUP SAYS; MIDEAST: HUMAN RIGHTS 
ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT USING TORTURE IN INTERROGATIONS PRODUCES 'A VICTORY 
FOR TERRORISM.' 
</P>

<P>
 Despite ongoing peace negotiations, Israel's security services continue to 
torture Palestinian prisoners routinely, an Israeli human rights group charged 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 With Islamic militants mounting deadly suicide attacks against Israeli 
civilian and military targets, many Israelis may not be sympathetic to 
complaints about the abuse of prisoners, acknowledged Yuval Ginbar, author of 
the report issued by the B'tselem organization and released at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are tough times," Ginbar said. "And as always, B'tselem is stuck 
between a rock and a hard place." 
</P>
<P>
 But the group believes, he said, that using torture in interrogations produces 
"a victory for terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
 B'tselem alleged that interrogators for the General Security Services -- also 
known as the Shabak, or Shin Bet -- and the army routinely subject prisoners to 
sleep deprivation, humiliation, physical abuse and threats. The organization 
first made such charges in 1991. Its periodic reports since then have always 
been rejected by the army. 
</P>
<P>
 "The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) has a clear and strict set of regulations 
governing actions permitted, as well as behavior prohibited, during questioning 
in IDF detention facilities," the army spokesman's office said in a written 
response to B'tselem's latest charges. "These rules determine that violence, 
threat of violence or any kind of humiliation or degradation may not be used 
against a person being questioned. These rules, in their most updated version, 
are in effect in every facility used for questioning by the IDF." 
</P>
<P>
 The Shin Bet made no comment on the report. Ginbar and other B'tselem 
officials criticized the government for recently approving new, secret methods 
of interrogation to cope with the suicide bombings. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Minister David Libai has said that even the new methods fall within 
the boundaries of guidelines issued by the Landau Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, the Landau Commission, a blue-ribbon panel, issued interrogation 
guidelines that allowed for "moderate physical pressure" on prisoners during 
interrogations when circumstances required security forces to extract 
information from suspects quickly in order to save lives. This became known as 
the "ticking bomb" scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a national near-consensus that all means of interrogation are 
justified in such circumstances, said Yizhar Be'er, B'tselem's director. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lately, it has been said that the whole reality that we are living in is a 
ticking bomb," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Landau Commission said that even in a "ticking bomb" scenario, "the 
pressure must not attain the degree of physical torture or brutality or severe 
harm to (a prisoner's) dignity that deprives him of his humanity." The 
government has insisted since then that it follows the commission's guidelines. 
B'tselem disputes the government's contention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Application of the recommendations resulted in the opposite (result) of that 
intended," B'tselem alleged in its report. Now, prisoners are routinely 
subjected to physical pressure, even in cases where they are ultimately 
released without charge, B'tselem alleged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are our smart interrogators?" Ginbar asked at the news conference. 
"Where are interrogators who can extract information out of people by using 
sophisticated means? Now, it seems, from the testimony that we have, that in 
order to become a Shin Bet interrogator, you have to speak Arabic -- especially 
curse words -- and you have to be strong physically." 
</P>
<P>
 In the report issued Wednesday, B'tselem said that its workers interviewed 
seven Palestinians and took sworn testimony from two others on the conditions 
they experienced during interrogations between May and September of 1994. Only 
five of the nine prisoners mentioned in the report allowed their names to be 
used. 
</P>
<P>
 One prisoner remains in detention. Seven others were released with no charges 
filed. One was convicted of minor offenses.

CLINTON URGES INDONESIA TO IMPROVE RIGHTS; ASIA: BUT PRESIDENT, IN MEETING WITH 
SUHARTO, SETS NO CONDITIONS THAT COULD DISRUPT TIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton on Wednesday pressed Indonesia to clean up its human rights 
record, but without setting deadlines or demanding remedies that could disrupt 
ties with the world's fourth-largest country. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh from a summit with leaders of 17 Pacific Rim nations, Clinton said that 
his Administration will pursue improved human rights "with conviction and 
without apology." But while Clinton and his lieutenants urged better treatment 
of ethnic minorities, journalists and labor activists, they largely left it to 
the Indonesians to find their way to such a goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The softer approach appeared to reflect the Administration's determination to 
assign a high priority to trade deals while avoiding costly confrontations over 
human rights. Last May, the Administration decided to drop linkage between 
trade benefits and human rights in its relations with China. 
</P>
<P>
 Under renewed pressure from advocacy groups and Congress, Clinton laid out his 
human rights goals in a meeting with Indonesian President Suharto at his 
Merdeka Palace, then talked to a group of U.S. and Asian business people. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher, meanwhile, met with a human rights 
commission appointed by the Indonesian government, while other U.S. officials 
held a partly boycotted meeting with local human rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Human rights have cast a shadow over the summit because of violent 
demonstrations in the disputed territory of East Timor and a five-day sit-in by 
Timorese students at the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton raised the Timor issue with his Indonesian hosts but failed to win any 
agreements to end the embassy protest. 
</P>
<P>
 A former Portuguese colony 1,200 miles east of Jakarta, East Timor was annexed 
by Indonesia in the 1970s and has been the site of frequent clashes between the 
predominantly Catholic population and Indonesian troops, who are mainly Muslim. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's state visit with Suharto included a "rather lengthy" discussion of 
human rights and the East Timor conflict, aides said. But rather than prod the 
Indonesian leader, Clinton simply told him that he welcomed the recent talks 
between the Indonesians and Timorese separatists in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also raised the issue of labor rights with Suharto, but aides said he 
did not specifically mention last week's jailing of Muchtar Pakpahan, the 
leader of Indonesia's largest independent trade union, for three years on 
charges of inciting unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has suspended an investigation into Indonesia's 
labor practices that will determine whether the country can continue to receive 
trade benefits known as the General System of Preferences. Human rights groups 
had pressed Clinton to resume the investigation, but he took no action. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton also praised the Indonesian leader for his efforts on behalf of 
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. On Tuesday, the group pledged to 
remove all trade barriers among APEC countries by the year 2020. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton maintained that his human rights concerns need not interfere with U.S. 
efforts to strengthen economic ties to the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though we will continue to promote human rights with conviction and 
without apology, we reject the notion that increasing economic ties in trade 
and partnerships undermine our human rights agenda," Clinton told a group of 
high-ranking U.S. and Asian business people. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher, describing Clinton's views to reporters, said that "the 
relationship between the United States and Indonesia can never reach its 
highest levels if the people of the United States don't have confidence that 
there is an effort here to respect the rights of all the citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher's deputy, Winston Lord, held an informal meeting with a group of 
local human rights activists, but the Indonesian Legal Aid Society and a number 
of other rights groups boycotted the meeting because they said it did not 
appear to be a serious effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was in a hurry, and there did not seem to be any point," said 
Goenawan Muhammad, the former editor of the best-selling Tempo magazine, which 
was ordered closed by the government for printing articles critical of the 
Suharto government. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Administration's foremost interest in the trip -- trade -- was 
also in evidence, as Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown witnessed the signing 
of a series of contracts, worth about $40 billion, between U.S. and Asian 
firms. Among them was a $35-billion deal between an Exxon Corp. affiliate and 
Indonesia's national oil company to extract liquid natural gas from the South 
China Sea. Brown helped put the deal together. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton was to arrive in Hawaii today for three days of relaxation before 
returning to Washington on Sunday.

HAITI'S ARISTIDE REPORTEDLY TO LEAVE PRIESTHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the slum priest whose fiery championship of 
the poor often pitted him against dictators and his Roman Catholic superiors, 
is leaving the priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vatican, long at odds with the populist priest, pressured Aristide to 
resign, a church source said Wednesday.Two government officials, who also spoke 
on condition of anonymity, confirmed that Aristide will leave the priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate comment by Aristide or specific reason given for his 
departure. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent Wednesday meeting with Haitian business leaders and Oscar Arias 
Sanchez, the former president of Costa Rica who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference, Arias urged Haitians to follow his country's model and 
abolish the army, which has been blamed for condoning thousands of political 
killings in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide's withdrawal from the priesthood is not likely to hurt his support 
among Haiti's poor, many of whom associated the conservative church hierarchy 
with the old military regime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salesian order expelled Aristide in 1988, saying his liberation theology 
teachings were inciting class war, but the Vatican never formally defrocked 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide, who swept U.N.-supervised elections four years ago, returned to 
Haiti on Oct. 15 after three years in exile following a September, 1991, 
military coup. Thousands of U.S. soldiers came to the Caribbean nation to help 
restore his government. 
</P>
<P>
 The church official, who requested anonymity, said Aristide will send a letter 
of resignation to the Vatican, but he did not say when. Aristide decided it 
would be better for predominantly Catholic Haiti if he resigned because the 
Vatican is so influential, the official said.

GOP LEADERS WEIGH PLANS TO CUT HOUSE COMMITTEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS B. ROSENSTIEL and MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican leaders began considering a plan Wednesday that would cut the 
number of committees in the House by more than a quarter and place most social 
programs under the jurisdiction of one panel. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders, who are debating this and at least three other plans, are 
expected to make decisions on the structure of the GOP-controlled House during 
the next two weeks. Each plan would reduce the number of committees and staff 
differently and sources said there likely would be "mixing and matching" before 
they were finished. 
</P>
<P>
 One plan circulating outside the Republican working group would cut the number 
of standing committees from 22 to 17. While the proposal is intended to 
streamline the committee system, it also clearly reflects a Republican agenda 
to reduce the scope of social programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those programs would be lumped together into a new Empowerment 
Committee, which would entirely replace the Education and Labor Committee; take 
jurisdiction over welfare away from the Ways and Means panel, and take public 
housing away from the Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The names of many committees might be changed in ways that evoke Republican 
ideas. Ways and Means, for instance, might become the Revenues Committee. 
Banking could become Financial Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican lawmakers were quick to move reporters away from specifics. 
"Nothing has been decided," said Rep. David Dreier (R-San Dimas), a principal 
architect of the structural changes. "I'm trying to find a middle ground, but 
it will be bold and it will be change." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who is expected to be the next Speaker, indicated 
that the three committees most likely to be eliminated are Merchant Marine and 
Fisheries, Post Office and Civil Service and District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Current proposals would not change the select committees, such as those on 
Intelligence, Aging and Hunger, which have an equal number of Republican and 
Democratic members. Their status will be addressed later, GOP aides said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is already strong opposition among Republicans to some of the suggested 
changes, such as drastically reducing the purview of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee. Under Democrat Rep. John D. Dingell of Michigan, Energy and Commerce 
has been one of the most powerful institutions in Congress. One widely 
circulated plan called for removing oversight of the environment, energy, 
securities and railroads from the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rep. Thomas J. Bliley Jr. (R-Va.), who is expected to chair the committee 
in the new Congress, so fiercely opposed what an aide said was an "emasculated" 
version of the committee that Gingrich agreed to scale back the reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the proposed changes are strictly Republican ideas. Many Democrats 
also agree that the House committee structure has become a problem.

CLINTON SCHOOL PRAYER POSITION IS CLARIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton's conciliatory reaction Tuesday to GOP proposals for school 
prayer was directed not toward a constitutional amendment, but toward 
legislation that would promote a neutral "moment of reflection" during the 
school day, his aides said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton had drawn no such distinction Tuesday, when he was asked about a 
proposal by Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), the House Speaker-to-be, for hearings 
on a constitutional amendment on school prayer and passage in Congress by the 
Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
 The President suggested that he would not oppose such an amendment, saying he 
wanted to "reserve judgment . . . . I certainly wouldn't rule it out. It 
depends on what it says." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, however, the White House said it is not an amendment that Clinton 
supports.

STEPPING UP ACTIVITY BOOSTS VALUE OF EXERCISE, STUDY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first study of the heart disease risks of a large group of serious 
runners, researchers found that although moderate exercise is good, the 
benefits continue to climb even at the most intense levels of activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Runners who logged 40 miles a week, for example, had a lower risk of heart 
disease than runners who covered 30 miles a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Current U.S. government guidelines emphasize moderate exercise for sedentary 
people but do not emphasize the continued benefits for more serious exercise 
enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, some serious exercisers may be discouraged from continuing, 
believing that they are not getting any additional benefits, said the study's 
author, Paul Williams, a researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in 
Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 He discussed the findings Wednesday at the annual meeting of the American 
Heart Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and 
sports-medicine specialists recommended that every American get 30 minutes of 
moderate exercise most days of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said that's an excellent suggestion for the 78% of Americans who 
engage in little or no physical activity. But the statement seemed to suggest 
that more intense exercise had little benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Wood of Stanford University, another authority on exercise and heart 
disease, agreed with Williams that that is not true. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the risk factors for heart disease -- including body fat, cholesterol, 
blood pressure and triglycerides -- continue to improve with more intense 
exercise, Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a study of nearly 7,000 male runners recruited from the readers of Runner's 
World magazine, Williams found, for example, that 12% of runners who covered 
less than 10 miles per week had dangerously low levels of good cholesterol. But 
that was true of only 2% of runners who ran 40 to 49 miles per week. 
</P>
<P>
 Levels of good cholesterol climbed in a direct relationship with the number of 
miles that runners covered each week, he found. Total cholesterol also dropped 
with increasing mileage. And an indicator of body weight likewise declined. 
</P>
<P>
 "People ask how much is enough," Wood said. "I always say it's like money: The 
more, the better."

BISHOPS URGE TOP ROLES FOR WOMEN BUT NOT PRIESTHOOD; RELIGION: PRELATES SUGGEST 
THE STUDY OF SCRIPTURE AND PURSUIT OF PRESIDENCIES AT CATHOLIC UNIVERSITIES. 
GROUP SAYS SOME IN U.S. CHURCH ARE STILL GUILTY OF SEXISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's Catholic bishops adopted a resolution Wednesday encouraging women 
to assume leadership positions up to -- but not including -- the priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement recognized Pope John Paul II's recent affirmation that women 
cannot be ordained as priests, advocating instead that they seek other roles in 
the church, such as pursuing studies in scripture, becoming presidents of 
Catholic universities and serving in non-ordained ministerial positions. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, the bishops told their 59 million members that some 
elements of the U.S. church have been guilty of sexism. "We have listened to 
the sounds of injustice and now come to strengthen the bonds of peace," said 
Bishop Eugene J. Gerber of Wichita, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We commit ourselves to enhancing the participation of women in every possible 
aspect of church life," the bishops said in their statement, approved on a vote 
of 228 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The bishops also adopted a resolution condemning violent behavior in all its 
forms, urging Catholics to oppose such actions as assisting with euthanasia and 
yelling at referees at athletic events. 
</P>
<P>
 In a specific recommendation addressing an area of concern to U.S. women, the 
bishops said that, although the universal catechism does not use gender-neutral 
language, in this country the church should avoid using such terms as "man" or 
"men" when referring to all of humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the bishops' statement on women, entitled "Strengthening the 
Bonds of Peace," a National Pastoral Life Center study found that women now 
hold 85% of parish ministry positions open to non-clergy. However, they have 
been slow to move into high-ranking jobs, such as diocesan chancellors, canon 
lawyers or marriage tribunal members and in some dioceses only priests hold 
those positions. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement encourages dioceses to allow women to seek such jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Annette Kane, executive director of the National Council of Catholic Women, a 
federation of 7,000 Catholic women's organizations, said she hopes that the 
statement will change some hearts and minds in dioceses where women are 
excluded from leadership roles. 
</P>
<P>
 But others were disappointed that the resolution did not contain stronger 
language. Frances Kissling, president of Catholics for a Free Choice, an 
organization that supports the right to dissent from papal decrees, said that 
the plan falls short of real progress for women. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of good sentiment and a lot of good language," Kissling said. 
"But until I see a written plan with some concrete goals as to numbers of women 
they're going to hire, I'm afraid they're not showing the political will to do 
the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Studies by Kissling's group show that 19% of the top church positions in the 
country were held by women in 1993, up from 16% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The bishops' resolution acknowledges that sexism, defined as "unjust 
discrimination based on sex," is still present in some elements of the church. 
The bishops soundly rejected sexism, calling it sinful and, according to the 
report, "contradicting the will of Christ." 
</P>
<P>
 But the report also took aim at radical feminist groups in a much-debated 
phrase that said: "We . . . reject extreme positions on women's issues which 
impede dialogue and divide the church." 
</P>
<P>
 The bishops called for a "moral revolution" in confronting violence in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 "Violence -- in our homes, our schools and streets, our nation and world -- is 
destroying the lives, dignity and hopes of millions of our sisters and 
brothers," the report said.

GINGRICH REGRETS HIS NASTY JABS AT CLINTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) has backpedaled on some recent 
nasty jabs directed at the White House, saying it was "foolish" to call 
President Clinton and his wife "counterculture McGovernicks." 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich told NBC's "Dateline" late Tuesday that his comment was a 
mistake."There was no point to my saying it. It was a frankly foolish thing to 
do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged that he needed to change his style in his new position. "I 
probably need to be 30% less pugnacious and 50% less negative," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich also expressed regret for having called Clinton and his 
Administration the "enemies of normal people" during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think 'enemies of normal people' was wrong and I wish I hadn't said it," 
Gingrich said. "Truth is, occasionally, I'm not very smart."

20 DEATHS OF ASTHMA DRUG USERS REPORTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Asthma sufferers have been dying since a new drug hit the market in April, 
some apparently because they mistakenly believed that the long-lasting drug 
would immediately relieve their breathing problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty deaths have been reported to the Food and Drug Administration among 
users of Serevent.It is not yet clear how many are linked to misuse of the 
drug, but manufacturer Glaxo Inc. is warning patients and doctors to use it 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
 Serevent is very effective at preventing asthma attacks and its effects last 
longer than other drugs, experts agree. But it doesn't treat actual asthma 
attacks -- because it takes at least 30 minutes to begin working. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very, very important that people understand Serevent is not for acute 
asthma," Ramona Jones of manufacturer Glaxo Inc. said Wednesday. Instead, she 
said, "it's so important for people to have that short-acting bronchodilator in 
case they get in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Glaxo last week began meeting with the FDA about strengthening Serevent's 
patient warning label. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA emphasizes that it can't yet prove a connection with the 20 deaths, 
because asthma by itself can be deadly. But improper Serevent use is suspected 
because many of the reports list asthma or "no drug effect" as the probable 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Serevent has proved safe in trials by hundreds of people, so patients should 
not abandon it, the FDA said. But it doesn't fight asthma attacks because it 
takes 30 to 45 minutes to work. Patients may overdose as they frantically try 
to make Serevent stop an attack -- and overdosing can cause abnormal heart 
rhythms and other dangers.

FOCUS IS SHIFTING BACK TO PACKWOOD PROBE; ETHICS: AFTER LONG DELAY, SENATE 
INVESTIGATORS ARE SAID TO BE GETTING KEY EVIDENCE IN SEXUAL MISCONDUCT CASE. 
PERSONAL DIARIES ARE BEING STUDIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate Ethics Committee's long-quiet investigation of sexual harassment 
allegations and other charges against Sen. Bob Packwood is reawakening even as 
the Oregon Republican stands on the threshold of new influence on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 After months of delay because of Packwood's legal challenges, committee 
investigators finally have started to receive "a good bit" of the critical 
evidence that they have been seeking: abridged versions of Packwood's personal 
diaries, according to a source close to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 By agreement of both sides in the dispute, former federal Judge Kenneth W. 
Starr, who now is looking into President Clinton's role in an Ozarks land deal 
as Whitewater independent counsel, has spent months screening the diaries, tape 
cassettes that Packwood dictated at the end of each day. The committee has 
subpoenaed Packwood's diaries from late 1989 through most of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Starr's task, which the source said is nearly complete, has been to review 
tape portions that Packwood's lawyers claim should be withheld from the 
committee on grounds that they are private family topics or matters involving 
attorney-client and physician-patient confidentiality. Starr is then to provide 
appropriate material to Senate investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has turned over a good bit of material to the committee," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Baird, the panel's chief counsel, declined to confirm the source's 
statement. He said only that "during the remainder of this year" the committee 
will review all tapes that are turned over in hopes of preparing a preliminary 
report for its members soon after Congress convenes in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee also hopes to resume questioning Packwood under oath by the end 
of 1994, Baird said. 
</P>
<P>
 That closed-door questioning was suspended last year pending the outcome of 
the dispute over Packwood's diaries. Packwood filed a series of court 
challenges to Senate subpoenas for the tape-recorded diaries and related 
transcripts, starting a months-long legal battle that ended last March when 
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist upheld lower court rulings that the diaries 
must be surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who is scheduled to become chairman of the 
Ethics Committee in January, and other leading Republican senators said that no 
effort would be made to prevent Packwood from assuming the chairmanship of the 
Finance Committee, on which he is now ranking GOP member. As chairman, Packwood 
would play a major role in any legislation dealing with health care, welfare 
reform or taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 McConnell explained through a spokesperson that forcing Packwood to forgo the 
chairmanship until the ethics inquiry is complete "would be contrary to the 
past practice of the Senate," where majority party members with seniority 
traditionally head committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Starr's appointment in the case, approved by the federal court last spring, 
preceded his being named last August to direct the unrelated, independent 
investigation into the investment in Whitewater Development Corp. of the 
President and his wife, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, while Clinton was 
governor of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 20-months-long ethics investigation, about 30 women have accused 
Packwood of making unwanted sexual advances, including some who claimed that he 
touched or kissed them against their will. Several were Senate employees. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been speculation that Packwood's diaries may shed the most light on 
related matters that the ethics panel is examining, including his alleged 
efforts to intimidate and discredit his accusers. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the diaries are considered crucial in the panel's investigation 
of job offers that businessmen and lobbyists allegedly made to the senator's 
estranged wife while the Packwoods were going through a divorce and while his 
alimony payments were being determined. Another central issue is whether the 
senator tampered with the diary tapes after learning last year that a subpoena 
from the committee was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 Indications of tampering came from a former secretary of Packwood's who had 
transcribed his tapes for many years. The former employee told committee 
investigators last year that some tapes and transcripts being sought in the 
case had been altered. 
</P>
<P>
 Altering subpoenaed material, if provable, could open Packwood to the 
possibility of criminal prosecution by the Justice Department for obstruction 
of justice. 
</P>
<P>
 In defending Packwood's right to a chairmanship, McConnell and Sen. Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.), who is expected to become majority leader in the new Congress, both 
noted that Democratic Sens. Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan and John Glenn of 
Ohio were permitted to keep their chairmanships of the Banking, Housing and 
Urban Affairs and Governmental Affairs committees, respectively, during the 
Ethics Committee's 1991 investigation of their relationship with Charles H. 
Keating Jr., a savings and loan owner since jailed for defrauding investors. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, after months of public hearings, the ethics panel severely 
chastised Riegle and Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) and mildly criticized 
Glenn and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) -- all on grounds that they had accepted 
political contributions from Keating while intervening in a federal bank board 
investigation of his firm, Lincoln Savings & Loan Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) received a harsh reprimand in the same 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. William V. Roth Jr. (R-Del.), a veteran member of the Finance Committee, 
said that he, too, will support Packwood's elevation to the chairmanship. Roth 
said that he sees no move by Republicans to block Packwood's ascendancy.

TROPICAL STORM LEAVES 6 DEAD IN FLORIDA, MENACES THE CAROLINAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CLARY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After pounding South Florida with three days of wind-whipped rain, Tropical 
Storm Gordon sped across the state's midsection Wednesday, re-emerged in the 
Atlantic Ocean and headed north for the Carolinas. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters insisted that Gordon, with top winds of about 45 m.p.h., has 
little chance to become a full-blown hurricane and is likely to merge with a 
low-pressure system off the coast of Georgia. Nonetheless, the rare late season 
storm has been deadly and destructive and gale warnings were posted as far 
north as North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shouldn't be a disaster but we're looking for some nasty weather" as far 
north as New England, warned forecaster Jerry Jarrell at the National Hurricane 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 In Florida, Gordon was blamed for at least six deaths. Gov. Lawton Chiles 
declared a state of emergency in several South and central Florida counties. 
</P>
<P>
 In Haiti, rescue workers continued to pull bodies from swollen creeks and 
mudslides. By some estimates, the death toll in Haiti has topped 400. 
</P>
<P>
 After its birth off the east coast of Nicaragua on Nov. 8, Tropical Storm 
Gordon became a meandering menace, blowing across Jamaica, ripping through 
eastern Cuba and the encampment of Cuban and Haitian refugees at the U.S. Naval 
Base at Guantanamo Bay and deluging Haiti with torrential rains before making 
an about-face and moving toward the Florida peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 For South Florida in particular, Gordon has been a persistent torment, dumping 
more than 15 inches of rain along sections of the southeast coast, knocking out 
power, washing out roadways, canceling school classes and causing millions of 
dollars in damage to the winter vegetable crop. Higher supermarket prices were 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bad news," said Kathleen Senobe of the Dade County Farm Bureau in 
Homestead, where 50% of all U.S. winter vegetables are grown. "Beans, peppers, 
eggplant, squash -- all are sitting in fields of water and we can't get in to 
harvest. We've got a $1-billion industry that's looking pretty grim." 
</P>
<P>
 State agriculture officials said that crop losses attributable to Gordon would 
exceed those caused by Hurricane Andrew in 1992. An appeal for federal disaster 
relief is planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Off the beach in Ft. Lauderdale, the 506-foot freighter Firat remained aground 
just 75 feet from shore, and provided a diversion for scores of tourists. U.S. 
Coast Guard officials said that a tug boat would attempt today to pull the ship 
out of the sand.

FAMILY; 'THREADS' A TAPESTRY OF MUSIC AND LAUGHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The press release for "The Gang's New Threads" at Theater 1110 in Hollywood 
didn't sound promising, identifying the show as a hip-hop musical exploring 
"the importance of designer clothes and fashion in the conformist world of 
urban youth." 
</P>
<P>
 Two hours of loud hip-hop and rap, and earnest teen-agers in baggy jeans and 
baseball caps? 
</P>
<P>
 Not even close. Although the show, written by Rob Hanning and Randy Weiner, 
loses some of its buoyant tone and clarity in the second act, this often 
hilarious, salty musical serves up big laughs; glorious, roof-raising vocals; 
clever R&B and rap lyrics, and dynamite hip-hop choreography. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot is simple. How is John (rap artist Novacain) going to win Jane 
(singer Trina), the girl of his dreams, when she belongs to the town of 
Trendsville's "fashion gang," the Phlavors, and he's just a plain T-shirt and 
jeans kind of guy? 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Fashion Man (Zeno), an intergalactic alien in silver lame (Zelda Hacker 
and Tanya Reid did the colorful, imaginative costumes), who gives John an idea 
for a hot new trend in apparel -- underwear as headgear. 
</P>
<P>
 John doesn't know that Fashion Man is teaching the Phlavors a lesson by giving 
John the stupidest idea he can. When the Trendsville teens make their new 
fashion statement at the upcoming "International Fashion Expo" in New York, 
they'll be exposed for the foolish fashion sheep that they are. Or will they? 
</P>
<P>
 It's lightweight stuff, but highly entertaining, thanks to heavyweight musical 
and physical talent. The good-looking teen-age and 20-something cast members 
are mostly experienced rap artists, singers and dancers. As Hitop, Darin 
Campbell's huge, rich voice is a show-stopper. Robin Andre, as Phlavors leader 
GQ, excels in comic attitude, backed up by Hitop's flunkies Kicks (Gimel 
Hooper) and Laces (Blas Lorenzo). 
</P>
<P>
 Hitop's girlfriend Roxanne (Latamra) is another vocal powerhouse. She also has 
hip-hop moves that won't quit, as does the entire six-member ensemble that acts 
as Greek chorus, chorus line and secondary characters. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanning and Weiner wrote the lyrics; Abby Schneider did the surprisingly (to 
non-teen-age ears) listenable music. Weiner and choreographer Sabrina Peck 
co-directed. Greg Van Horn did the simple set. The cut-above sound design and 
lights are by Meegan Holmes and Joe Allegro, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Gang's New Threads," Theater 1110, 1110 N. Hudson Ave., Hollywood, 
Thursday-Saturday, 8 p.m.; Sunday, 3 p.m. through Nov. 27 (except Thanksgiving 
Day). Ages 12 and up. $12.50; (213) 466-1767.

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: GIVING SMOKERS WHO QUIT CREDIT THAT'S DUE

 Attitudes about smokers and smoking seem to split along generational lines. 
They also tend to burn hot and messy. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging by the crowds hanging outside of nightclubs and by the recent spate of 
movies starring young actors sporting limp hair, pale skin, black polyester and 
Marlboros, the under-25 crowd seems to have embraced smoking as a hip form of 
self-expression -- which shouldn't really surprise anyone over 25 who remembers 
ever having been under 25. 
</P>
<P>
 To many members of an older generation, smokers are right up there with the 
great social pariahs of our time -- murderers, rapists and, if you are also an 
environmentalist, litterers. 
</P>
<P>
 And the anti-smoking brigade is a lot meaner than it once was. Ever notice how 
the once-meek and beleaguered nonsmoker now reacts to a smoker who dares light 
up in a restaurant, a building, even an open-air venue? It's not a pretty 
sight. Such aggressive tactics, as well as California's reaction to Proposition 
188 -- the tobacco industry smoke screen that attempted and failed to replace 
existing smoking controls with less restrictive legislation -- have led me to 
believe that we'll soon be putting referendums on the ballot to make smoking a 
capital crime. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not suggesting that the crusade of nonsmokers is unfounded. Looking at the 
latest statistics linking secondary smoke to cancer makes it easy to understand 
nonsmokers' concerns. It just seems that at times they lose perspective and 
forget that smokers after all, are people too. Smelly, wheezy people, perhaps, 
but people nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 This week's Centerpiece story, which coincides today with the American Cancer 
Society's annual Great American Smokeout, was written by local free-lance 
writer Rachel Altman, who is sympathetic to smokers and nonsmokers, since she 
has been both. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it was a mere two weeks ago that Altman tossed the pack and sought 
refuge in nicotine patches and a pack of Doublemint. And she chronicled the 
whole sordid ordeal in the Reluctant Novice column, part of the cover package. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman said it was no surprise to find out that many researchers widely regard 
smoking to be a serious addiction, right up there with drugs and alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judging by the withdrawal symptoms I experienced myself, I now know what a 
miserable addiction it is," she said.

 "I can understand how nonsmokers feel about the lowly smoker because even when 
I was smoking, I often hated myself for being at the mercy of such a miserable 
habit. But it really is a very difficult thing to give up. People deserve 
credit for being able to pull it off." 
</P>
<P>
 Congratulations Rachel. But for the next few months I'd avoid nightclubs, all 
Generation X movies, white pancake makeup and black polyester. You don't want 
to take any unnecessary chances.

SOUNDS: HEARTENING CHORUS PROGRAMS; OJAI CAMERATA TUNES UP FOR ITS FOURTH 
SEASON NOT LONG AFTER VENTURA COUNTY MASTER CHORALE PERFORMED 'CARMINA BURANA.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A formidable pack of music lovers flocked to the Oxnard Civic Auditorium two 
weekends ago to hear the Ventura County Master Chorale strike up the cozily 
ritualistic pageantry of Carl Orff's "Carmina Burana." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a good crowd with big ears in a spacious venue. Never mind that, next 
spring, the neighboring Los Robles Master Chorale will be introducing Orff's 
grand work to the Civic Arts Plaza. The skeptic might wonder, what gives here? 
</P>
<P>
 For whatever reason, there seems to be a healthy appetite for choral music in 
Ventura County, both in terms of an audience and of singers to fill the 
ensemble ranks. It was a massive but supple, confident ensemble sound that 
radiated from the stage in Oxnard, under Burns Taft's able direction. Local 
soprano Diane Plaster filled in for ailing guest soloist Louisa Ann Parks. 
</P>
<P>
 This was Orff's piano-percussion arrangement, and the unusual sight and sound 
of three pianos and percussion battery beneath the choral forces added to the 
freshness of the affair. Dancing pianos and tympany substituted for the 
"orchestra" passage in "On the Lawn." The soaring and guttural, sacred and 
profane voices were an effective contrast to the percussively derived textures. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert's brief first half belonged to other Orff works: Music for 
Children, Vol. 2, performed by the Master Chorale Children's Chorus; and "Veni 
Creator Spiritus." In this provocative 1930 work, haunting cadences build to 
powerful climaxes and doleful long notes sail distractedly over bubbling 
rhythms. The ensemble caught the spirit of Orff and delivered it neatly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Master Chorale's next concerts will be a Christmas-related program, on 
Dec. 10 and 17 at various churches around the county, culminating in their 
annual concert at the San Buenaventura Mission on Dec. 18. 'Hispanica Viva' in 
Ojai 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in another corner of the county, the Ojai Camerata will be 
launching its fourth season this Saturday night. No one can accuse the group, 
under Charles McDermott's direction, of taking the safe road. Last season's 
opening concert was "An American Collage," with music by Charles Ives, Emma Lou 
Diemer, Aaron Copland and Amy Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's opener, an enticing program under the title "Hispanica Viva!," 
will feature music by Spanish Renaissance composer Cristobal Morales and the 
late great Argentine composer-bandoneon player Astor Piazzolla, who reigned 
over the field of innovative "nuevo tango." 
</P>
<P>
 In one sense, the centerpiece of the concert will be yet another local 
premiere by composer Miguel del Aguila. The 37-year-old composer calls Oxnard 
home, but his reputation in the music world at large continues to broaden. 
</P>
<P>
 Just this fall, his "Conga Line in Hell" was performed by the Juilliard 
Ensemble in New York. That was just prior to the world premiere of his 
larger-scaled companion piece, "Conga," ushered into the world by the Ventura 
County Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 What the audience will hear in Ojai this weekend is something older and more 
piecemeal from Aguila's library. For this occasion, Aguila has created a choral 
suite from his opera "Cuauhtemoc." The opera, which deals with the last Aztec 
emperor, entails 450 pages of music. It is his magnum opus, so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took one year of hard work for which I wouldn't get paid," Aguila said. "I 
realized that, because the story was told from the Indians' perspective, in the 
same year when the whole world was celebrating the discovery of America and its 
interpretation in European history, it would be hard to get a commission. So I 
just decided to work on it." 
</P>
<P>
 What is the status of the opera now? Are there any potential productions? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still waiting for somebody to come along with big bucks," he laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring the arrival of a patron or producer willing to put the opera on in its 
intended grand manner, del Aguila is getting snippets of the work out in 
concert format. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can do it in concert like this, in different suites," said del Aguila, 
"which is a nice way to expose the audience to it, or I can do a chamber 
version and then downscale it. Or I can do the big version. But I cannot do 
anything in between. If they want to do the big version of this opera, it's a 
lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
 One problem Aguila doesn't face, at least not to the degree that many new 
music composers do, is that of audience appreciation. Contemporary music has 
often alienated uninitiated listeners by favoring intellectual schemes and 
modes of "difficult listening" over emotional fiber. Although he deploys enough 
structural or tension-inducing elements to maintain cerebral interest in his 
music, del Aguila also seems to go for the gut, leaning toward narrative or 
programmatic ideas to keep the blood flowing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lived long enough in Vienna to react against head music," he said. "I guess 
my music is becoming very theatrical. I read a lot of plays and I get so many 
ideas about performing music and how to write it, and the timing and editing. I 
think that's what makes my music sound theatrical or alive to many people. I 
don't think of notes, but the psychological meaning behind the music." 
</P>
<P>
 Modesty is the rule when it comes to the concert seasons of these groups, 
working within stifling budgetary realities by presenting only a few 
performances per year. Even so, the sum total of choral performances in the 
county this season is heartening for anybody who loves the sound of massed 
voices raised in song. Details

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: NELSON VOWS HE'LL BE 'REGULAR WILLIE' FOR 2 HOURS AT ARTS 
PLAZA; THE LEGENDARY PERFORMER BRINGS HIS BAND FOR PAIR OF THOUSAND OAKS 
CONCERTS. FELLOW TEXAN BILLY JOE SHAVER OPENS.

 It's hard to imagine a better choice to bring country music to the new 
Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza than country legend, Willie Nelson. Considered 
by many to be one of the founding fathers of country music, Nelson has more 
than 100 albums to his credit. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992 he received the Academy of Country Music's Pioneer Award, and the 
following year he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening for Nelson on Sunday and Wednesday evenings will be fellow Texas 
singer-songwriter, Billy Joe Shaver, whose tunes have been covered by Elvis 
Presley, Waylon Jennings, John Anderson and Nelson himself. And "Honky Tonk 
Heroes," -- an entire album of Shaver's songs recorded by Jennings -- is often 
cited as the album that launched the "outlaw" movement in country music. 
</P>
<P>
 In the accompanying photo, Nelson may look more like Cole Porter than a 
country music outlaw, but don't let the get-up fool you. 
</P>
<P>
 The swank image is for his new compact disc, "Healing Hands of Time," a lushly 
arranged, romantic album of standards on the EMI/Liberty label, which was 
recorded with a 60-piece orchestra and a hot, Nashville country band. 
</P>
<P>
 As his major label follow-up to last year's critically acclaimed "Across the 
Borderline" CD, Nelson has moved in a new direction. This latest release -- 
featuring timeless classics by American songwriters including Jerome Kern, 
Oscar Hammerstein and Nelson himself -- beautifully showcases the popular side 
of Willie-as-standards-crooner. 
</P>
<P>
 But during our phone interview last week, the Redheaded Stranger from Abbot, 
Tex., told me there will be no tuxes or orchestras on the Civic Auditorium 
stage. "It'll be a regular Willie -- two hours," he said. "I'll have my band. 
And I'll sing everything I can think of." 
</P>
<P>
 And here's what else the writer of "Crazy," "Angel Flyin' Too Close to the 
Ground" and "On the Road Again," had to say: 
</P>
<P>
 This new album of standards has gone full circle from your 1978 record, 
"Stardust." How did you choose the songs? 
</P>
<P>
 When you say I recorded standards -- and six of 'em are mine -- that's a nice 
feeling to have my songs along with "All the Things You Are," by Jerome Kern, 
and "If I Had My Way," -- which is copyrighted back in 1913. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of mine were requested by Jimmy Bowen, the producer. They were "Funny 
How Time Slips Away," "Crazy," and "Night Life." So naturally I said yes to 
those. And the rest of 'em we set down and talked about 'cuz we were lookin' 
for the romantic-type theme. 
</P>
<P>
 The tone is very nostalgic, meditative. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is a sort of concept that runs through it. A relationship ends and 
begins and ends and begins and ends (laughs) and so on, all the way through. 
And "The Healing Hands of Time" is sort of the theme that flows through it. 
</P>
<P>
 To extend that to your personal life, if I may: You've lived life like a 
country song with the career ups, downs, the marriages . . . you do have kind 
of a reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 (Chuckles) I know it. 
</P>
<P>
 And you can tell in the album that you're tracing the seasons of one's life 
and relationships. But after reading the article about you in the 
September-October issue of Acoustic Guitar magazine, I think your real love 
affair has been the lifelong one with the acoustic guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, yeah. I would definitely agree with that -- that my best girlfriend I 
guess has always been my guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 Your country guitar style using nylon strings is instantly recognizable. So is 
your voice. And I think you're known more as a singer-songwriter. But if you 
had to choose only one area, which would it be? 
</P>
<P>
 I'd rather play the guitar because you never learn all there is to know about 
playing the guitar -- neither do you about performing or singing or writing. 
But the guitar is my favorite instrument. And I could stay with it forever and 
learn a little bit every day. 
</P>
<P>
 As a former deejay, what's your opinion about the radio stations that only 
play hot, new country music? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, everything always travels in cycles. And there is this particular trend 
these days where -- if you're over 40, if (the song is) over five years old or 
whatever -- then you don't get on the play list. But I still think that time 
will change all those rules. There's still enough traditional country fans out 
there to revolt against that type of thinking. And I think it'll show up in 
their ratings. It'll hit 'em in the pocketbook. And they'll eventually get back 
to adding a little bit. I'm not saying, "Turn it all over to the old guys." But 
I'm not saying, "Turn it all over to the new ones," either. I think there's 
room to mix it up. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's next for you? 
</P>
<P>
 I have some ideas for a concept album that I'm working on. We just recorded a 
new "Highwaymen" album in L.A. with Jennings, Kris Kristofferson and Johnny 
Cash, that's due out next March. And we did a documentary film about that 
album. 
</P>
<P>
 Can we expect any surprises from those projects? 
</P>
<P>
 (Laughs) I guess the biggest surprise is that we're all four still around.

THEATER REVIEW; AREA'S COLLEGE STAGES OFFER DIVERSE SHOWS; 'ARMS AND THE MAN,' 
'LA VIE PARISIENNE' AND 'MINOR DEMONS' WILL CLOSE ON SUNDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Three openings last weekend hint at the variety of theatrical productions 
presented at local colleges. Two are period costume shows. Two are 
issue-oriented pieces, of which one is a drama and one is a comedy. And one of 
the three is an English-language adaptation of a French operetta. Two are quite 
good; one's an honorable miss. And all three close this Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura College's production of George Bernard Shaw's "Arms and the Man" and 
Moorpark College's version of the Jacques Offenbach operetta "La Vie 
Parisienne" are the costume shows; in Thousand Oaks, Cal Lutheran University is 
mounting the contemporary drama "Minor Demons." 
</P>
<P>
 Written by Bruce Graham and first presented by a regional theater in 
Philadelphia, "Minor Demons" reads more like a TV movie than a play: Lawyer 
Deke Winters, his life in shambles after a high-profile career in the Big City, 
returns home to work in a small, local firm. There, he almost immediately 
becomes involved in a murder case that pits him against his boyhood best 
friend, now the town's chief of police. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending an accused rapist-murderer, Winters stumbles on a technicality that 
can get his client off; a procedural error by the chief, who fears disgrace if 
the mistake is made public. Despite his claim to the contrary, the suspect may 
well be guilty. So is Winters' obligation to his client, or to the community at 
large? 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw's "Arms and the Man" is a satirical look at war. A Swiss mercenary 
fighting in the Serbian army hides out in the home of the commander of the 
enemy Bulgarians. There, the soldier disrupts the household, while exposing 
fighting as foolishness. 
</P>
<P>
 And the adaptation of "La Vie Parisienne," with a new book and lyrics by Phil 
Park, takes a look at 19th-Century Parisian society, focusing on a couple of 
genteel bounders in search of an evening's romance. 
</P>
<P>
 For most audiences, "Minor Demons" will be easiest to grasp, and it's an 
interesting couple of hours distinguished by some fine acting. Especially 
notable in that respect are Kevin P. Kern as attorney Winters, newly dried-out, 
divorced and trying to escape his former life, and Christian Isley as the 
tormented teen who may have committed a vicious murder. Among the supporting 
cast are Josh Green as the well-meaning police chief, and Kelly Regina Culwell 
as the hometown lawyer who first sees Winters as an interloper and a threat, 
and then -- told you this sounds like a TV movie! -- as a potential romantic 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Gardner, chair of the university's drama department, directs a smooth 
production that's only slightly hampered by the inclusion of some projected 
images that are more distracting than edifying. 
</P>
<P>
 Over in Moorpark, the college is presenting one of its two or three annual 
musical productions under the direction of veteran faculty member Marilyn 
Anderson. She has a gift for unearthing rarely done operettas and finding 
singers capable of performing them. As a result, other than the odd Gilbert and 
Sullivan work produced elsewhere, Moorpark College is the unlikely operetta hub 
of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The current version of "La Vie Parisienne" is evidently quite different from 
the 1866 original; not only has Phil Park altered the libretto and lyrics and 
Ronald Hanmer adapted the music, but director Anderson has also wrought her own 
trims and other changes. 
</P>
<P>
 What's left is some lilting music, colorful costumes and this: After being 
discouraged in the romantic pursuit of the same woman, Raoul and Bobinet, 
described as "men about Paris," decide to redirect their attentions to "the 
ladies of society." Raoul's first target is a visiting baroness; his first 
chore, of course, is to separate her from the baron. In the meantime, a 
visiting Brazilian millionaire is in earnest pursuit of Gabrielle, a 
glove-maker who numbers Raoul among her clients. High jinks ensue. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond M. Hebel and David Milligan portray Raoul and Bobinet, with Cecelia 
Lopez Brinkley as Metalla, the coquettish woman who prompted the redirection of 
their attentions but who keeps popping up at generally inopportune times. 
Andrew Kreigel and Mark Tortorici have several entertaining moments in the 
play's most comic roles (the Brazilian and Marcel, a maitre d'hotel). Anderson 
herself appears rather briefly as the baroness, with Andrew Brasted as the 
blustery baron, set for a night on the town without the baroness to distract 
him from his own amorous adventures. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Robles, an opera singer who last appeared on the Moorpark stage as Mabel 
in the college's "Pirates of Penzance," is seen and heard here as the fetching 
Gabrielle. 
</P>
<P>
 Daryl Archibald, who has worked as Anderson's pianist and musical director for 
several productions, is here abetted by an effective six-piece orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually dependable for worthy productions, Ventura College has misstepped with 
its ill-conceived "Arms and the Man." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, "Shavian" has come to be a term evoking the Irish 
playwright-critic's dry wit. In the current show, director Jay Varela and his 
cast go for dialogue that's as loud and brash as the soldiers' comic-opera 
costumes. The actors' generally arch, strained delivery is totally foreign to 
the script; by contrast, Simon Alvarado's more naturalistic portrayal of Swiss 
Capt. Bluntschli stands out like Cary Grant would in a Marx Brothers movie. 
Certainly, he's the "normal" character among a houseful of cartoons, but to 
these ears director Varela overstates the contrast severalfold. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the play has its share of amusing characters and situations, and might 
be worth seeing if only because Shaw is performed locally so rarely. Details

 When Jim Franzen quit smoking in 1993, after 43 years as a smoker, it was his 
35th attempt. Like many smokers who want to quit, Franzen, a Ventura resident 
who works as an artist for Disney Studios, had tried everything -- nicotine 
chewing gum, the nicotine patch, even going it alone "cold turkey." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an alcoholic and I had given up alcohol," Franzen said, "but that was 
nothing compared to cigarettes. Booze is addictive, but it's not as portable as 
cigarettes. And even a drunk doesn't reinforce the habit as much as a smoker. 
The pack-a-day smoker gets 400 hits daily; no drug gets reinforced as much as 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the American Cancer Society, of the 46 million Americans who 
still smoke -- 26% of the adult population -- 80% say they would like to quit. 
And of the 2.5 million California smokers who attempted to stop in 1993, less 
than 10% succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
 It comes as no surprise to smokers who have tried to quit that the smoking 
"habit" is widely recognized in medical and scientific literature as full-blown 
drug addiction. A common scenario of nicotine withdrawal symptoms can include 
irritability, anxiety, headaches, difficulty concentrating and memory loss, 
insomnia or an excessive need for sleep, inertia, increased appetite, weight 
gain, digestive changes, constipation and even depression. 
</P>
<P>
 If it sounds like a biblical plague or the tests of Job, it is -- ask anyone 
who has tried. And that's just the beginning. Once through the initial three to 
seven days of acute withdrawal, ex-smokers face a lifelong struggle to steer 
clear of tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 They must contend with a complex mix of habitual behaviors, social rituals, 
and psychological and emotional dependence -- all while resisting the lure of a 
drug that remains legal, easily available, and, compared to other potent drugs, 
socially acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 Now for some good news: More than 3 million Americans quit smoking every year, 
according to the National Cancer Institute. And increasing bans on smoking, 
combined with a wealth of structured smoking-cessation programs, create a 
climate in which there has never been a better time to toss the pack. PICKING A 
PROGRAM 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so the decision has been made. You decide you can no longer ignore the 
nagging of your family and the unarguable ill effects of smoking on your health 
(is that me wheezing at the top of the stairs?). Now what? Should you join a 
program, or go it on your own? What can you expect on the road from "smoking" 
to "non," and who has the map? 
</P>
<P>
 Franzen says that for him, the biggest boon to finally breaking the habit was 
the support and inspiration he received from the American Lung Assn.'s Freedom 
from Smoking program, which he used in conjunction with the nicotine patch. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got cravings during the program and after, I would call my fellow 
addictees and we'd discuss and compare notes. I needed people I could talk to 
who were having the same problems, who wouldn't judge me, and I needed to meet 
people who have quit, because I figured if they could do it, I could do it. I 
know it's not for everyone, but for me it's a miracle. I feel like I'm really 
done with cigarettes now." 
</P>
<P>
 For Ventura County residents, the Freedom from Smoking program is one of many 
options that offer support and teach a variety of coping strategies to help a 
smoker quit. Most incorporate techniques from behavior modification and 
cognitive therapies, as well as health education, group counseling and support. 
</P>
<P>
 "A large part of breaking the habit is creating new ones," says Jerry Leavitt, 
assistant director of the American Lung Assn. and facilitator of the Freedom 
from Smoking program. "Physically, the nicotine leaves the system in 72 hours, 
but as hard as that stage is, it's short-lived. Most people find the on-going 
psychological addiction much harder to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're conditioned to want that cigarette at certain times, and it serves a 
lot of purposes for us: We use it to deal with stress, it's a break from 
routine, it's a social thing, it's how we cope with loneliness, with boredom, 
and for some, the cigarette becomes a substitute for friends, and a source of 
comfort." 
</P>
<P>
 A standard approach is to give the smoker two to four weeks before quitting to 
observe and record smoking habits, tracking when and why he or she smokes and 
noting the behaviors and emotions that trigger the desire for a cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynne Rowe, program director for the Smoking Cessation Research Institute in 
Palo Alto, says that a period of preparation for quitting is essential. "The 
smoker has all these rituals. You get in the car and you light a cigarette. You 
finish a meal and you have a cigarette. It's helpful to give them time before 
they quit to think about these trigger points, and to create positive 
replacements." 
</P>
<P>
 Once trigger points are identified, the group and facilitator help the smoker 
devise coping strategies. Some suggestions: Change your routine; distract 
yourself by doing a crossword puzzle or taking up needlepoint; avoid places and 
people that might tempt you to smoke; soak in a hot bath; chew on stick 
cinnamon, toothpicks, sugarless gum. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Rowe, it's important to think of smoking cessation in positive 
terms, to replace the pleasure you get from smoking with other pleasurable 
activities. "You want to take away the feeling of it being a burden," she says. 
"If it's a burden, it's doomed to fail." 
</P>
<P>
 But habits are more than a collection of behaviors: The rituals around smoking 
and the effect of nicotine itself, which acts as both stimulant and relaxant, 
become the smoker's way of dealing with emotional stress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people start smoking when they're young because they think it's cool," 
Leavitt says. "But then it becomes a way of managing stress, and it becomes so 
ingrained as a way of dealing with emotions that, oddly enough, we use it to 
cope with pleasurable feelings as well as with negative feelings -- like the 
cigarette after the meal, the cigarette after sex. The earlier you started 
smoking the less apt you are to have developed alternative coping strategies." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Leavitt points out, living a life that is free of stress and 
emotion is not possible. "But nonsmokers manage, so there are other ways of 
dealing with it, and the smoker needs to learn them." 
</P>
<P>
 Stress management and relaxation techniques form the backbone of a number of 
smoking cessation programs. One widely taught method involves learning to 
breathe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's essential to breathe deeply to control stress," says Leavitt. "The 
smoker typically takes shallow breaths, except when smoking. People who have 
gone through this program and quit successfully tell me that the single most 
helpful thing they learned was deep breathing." ADDING EXERCISE 
</P>
<P>
 Along with stress management, most programs encourage the quitter to begin a 
physical conditioning program, which helps combat stress and control weight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good if you can do something aerobic, but it doesn't have to be a lot," 
says Georgette Davis, facilitator of the American Cancer Society's Fresh Start 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I teach people stretching and relaxation and tell them that if a craving is 
strong, take a five-minute break and stretch, or get up from the desk and go 
for a fast walk. The more you exercise the faster you'll work the nicotine out 
of your system and feel better. It helps if people see the whole process in a 
positive way -- as part of the creation of a healthy lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
 As well as helping smokers through the difficult initial period of withdrawal, 
stress management offers smokers new ways of coping with feelings that 
cigarettes may have helped them to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Nina Schneider, a smoking cessation researcher for the UCLA School of 
Medicine and the Veterans Administration Hospital in Brentwood, has studied 
tobacco dependence and run smoking cessation clinics for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as if we each carry a tool kit, and we reach in there and pull out a 
tool for dealing with whatever comes up -- a tool for anger, for socializing, 
for aggression, for being tired," she says, "But smokers, the first tool they 
reach for is a cigarette. That's why it's important to visualize ahead, to 
anticipate situations and strategize solutions in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 "In clinics I'll say to people, 'OK, you don't smoke. Now here comes something 
that's difficult for you to cope with -- what will you actually do instead of 
smoke?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Davis encourages smokers to learn to deal with emotions directly, and to 
become more assertive about needs and wants. "Go in your bedroom and beat a 
pillow and scream, if you have to. Allow yourself to cry. Ask yourself if the 
situation is one that can be changed by communicating with another person 
directly, then do that if possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen a number of smokers who are leading packed lives -- they're working 
and then coming home and taking care of the kids, they never have a moment to 
themselves -- and part of the process for them is learning to put themselves 
first." 
</P>
<P>
 Most programs allow the smoker to use nicotine replacement therapy in addition 
to the program, and leave this to the discretion of the individual in 
consultation with a physician. Both the gum and the patch work by delivering a 
steady dose of nicotine that is gradually decreased over time. 
</P>
<P>
 The patch is self-applied once a day, while the gum is self-administered in 
prescribed doses as needed. Both require a prescription. 
</P>
<P>
 While not a magic potion that will automatically turn a smoker into a 
nonsmoker, nicotine replacement can be a powerful ally. "The patch is not a 
panacea," Rowe says. "People think that it will completely take their cravings 
away. It doesn't. But it will mitigate them and ease the withdrawal process." 
</P>
<P>
 Rowe recommends that if nicotine replacement is used, it should be combined 
with a counseling or support program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is essential, while on the patch, to focus on the behavioral and 
psychological aspects of your smoking -- changing your habits, learning to deal 
with emotions and stress without smoking. Ideally, by the time you come off 
nicotine altogether, you think of yourself as a nonsmoker." KEY TO SUCCESS 
</P>
<P>
 According to the National Cancer Institute, nearly half of adults who once 
smoked have quit; of those, 90% say they did it on their own, without the aid 
of a formal cessation program. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean you should discount the help you might receive from a 
program: like-minded buddies to share ups and downs with, somewhere to vent 
when times get rough, and a wealth of health information and coping strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 But experts agree that whether you choose to participate in a structured 
program or go it alone, the key to success is the same: The smoker must really 
want to quit. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to get people when they're motivated," Rowe says, "not because their 
spouse wants them to quit, not because their doctor says they have to, but 
because they want to. Then you give them a structure to enact that commitment." 
</P>
<P>
 In most programs, the smoker is asked to write a list of reasons for quitting, 
then to whittle the list down to a primary motivation. When tempted to smoke, 
smokers are encouraged to repeat their primary motivation to themselves: "I 
want to live to see my grandchildren grow up," or "I want to wake up in the 
morning with clear lungs and be able to breathe freely." For many smokers, 
reminding themselves of their goal gives them the impetus to stay away from 
tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong motivation also creates a willingness in the wanna-be ex-smoker to set 
priorities and make allowances for the process of withdrawal. In order to stop 
smoking, for example, you may find it necessary to take time off work to give 
yourself a block of time that is as stress-free as possible. You may want to 
tell friends and family that you are giving up smoking and ask their 
forbearance during your inevitable mood swings. 
</P>
<P>
 And you'll need to forgive yourself for behavior and performance that does not 
always match the level you have come to expect. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is we're all looking for quick fixes, and there are none," 
Franzen says. "If you're going through withdrawal, you will suffer. You will 
have bouts of anxiety, there's just no way around it, and it won't be over 
until it's over. Stopping any addictive practice requires being ready and 
motivated to do whatever it takes." 
</P>
<P>
 Ask those who have successfully quit and they will tell you that leading a 
smoke-free life is well worth it. Dulanie Ellis-LaBarre, a script supervisor 
and mother who lives in Ojai, quit smoking three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The illusion I lived under as a smoker was that smoking made me more calm, 
but it turns out to be the opposite," she says. "I'm much calmer, more patient 
and tolerant, and my moods are more even now that I'm off the roller-coaster of 
smoking and craving. 
</P>
<P>
 "As hellacious as quitting smoking is -- and it is, it's the worst and nothing 
else compares -- once you get through it, the view from the other side is 
glorious." Getting With the Program 
</P>

 MONDAY 
</P>
<P>
 Having decided to quit smoking once and for all, you flush half a pack of 
cigarettes down the toilet, slap on a nicotine patch and go to the store to buy 
sunflower seeds, carrots, hard candies, grape juice, sugarless gum and other 
distractions. 
</P>
<P>
 Your first post-smoking task: Begin to work on an article about quit-smoking 
programs. Unfortunately, you can't seem to concentrate; images of lighting a 
cigarette keep flashing through your mind. You try deep breathing, then chew 
sunflower seeds, carrots, gum. Still desperately craving cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
 You give up and go to the gym for a two-hour workout. Immediately after, you 
feel a great urge to smoke. You stop at a store, buy a half-pound of 
chocolate-covered almonds, polish them off before getting home. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, you attend a reading at Barnes & Noble, throughout which you suck 
candies like a madman, rummaging in your purse for another as soon as one is 
finished. You ask lots of questions, loudly, aggressively, interrupting other 
people who give you dirty looks. 
</P>
<P>
 11 p.m. Can't sleep. Watch David Letterman. 
</P>
<P>
 12:30 a.m. Fix a cup of chamomile tea. Take a Benadryl to make you drowsy. 
Eventually fall asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 TUESDAY 
</P>
<P>
 You try, again, to work, but it's hopeless. You're distracted by cravings. You 
log onto Internet stop-smoking news group and spend the morning maniacally 
telling strangers things you've never told your husband, your best friend, your 
therapist. 
</P>
<P>
 You find sunflower seeds very satisfying to chew, chomp, pound with teeth, 
destroy (the little scamps) and tear to shreds. Ha! Take that. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunchtime comes very quickly; you've moved it up from noon to, oh, let's see, 
it must be 11:05 now. Alas, another morning with no work done. You go to the 
gym and pump the Stairmaster while watching a soap. Cry unabashedly. You ask 
your husband if he will still love you if you are intense, interrupt all the 
time, weep uncontrollably and gain 20 pounds. He says he thinks there's 
medication you can take, a response that's less than encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
 11:30 p.m. Letterman again. Make a note: Call doctor and ask if she knows of a 
Benadryl addicts support group. 
</P>
<P>
 WEDNESDAY 
</P>
<P>
 Dreamed that you had quit smoking and feel happy -- then see yourself in a 
mirror, grotesquely obese. You log onto Internet and post: "If anyone knows of 
a fat-free sunflower seed, please e-mail me immediately!!!" Make a mental note: 
Stop using so many exclamations points!!! 
</P>
<P>
 You read through notes for the article you need to write, but the words make 
no sense, and your Internet buddies are getting on your nerves: all that 
whining, and worse, the cheerleading from the ones who are having an easy time. 
</P>
<P>
 5 p.m. Panic. What possessed you to quit when you are facing a deadline? You 
said you would do anything to become an ex-smoker, but you didn't expect to 
give up your livelihood. And what sort of work is available to people with the 
attention span of an e-mail message? 
</P>
<P>
 Images of famous writers sitting at typewriters flash through your head -- 
they're all holding cigarettes. What made you think you could be a writer, and 
sane, thin, and a nonsmoker all at once? 
</P>
<P>
 Your daughter calls from college, depressed and talks for an hour about her 
problems (yeah, right, like she thinks she's got problems). You murmur 
consoling noises and take deep breaths, while maintaining a silent mantra that 
goes like this: "I want a cigarette, I want a cigarette, I want a cigarette." 
</P>
<P>
 The husband catches you in the act of eating peanut butter out of a jar and 
offers a lecture on fat content. You yell at him to get off your back, then 
have a glass of wine -- OK, three glasses of wine. They only make you want to 
smoke more. 
</P>
<P>
 10 p.m. Post frantic note on Internet to ask if anyone has had a craving in 
the last five straight hours. While posting, devour a package of Oreos. Now you 
have a headache. Make a note to call doctor: Can you overdose on deep 
breathing? 
</P>
<P>
 THURSDAY 
</P>
<P>
 Fall asleep around 1:30 a.m., but the cat wakes you at 4:30 to go out, then at 
5:30 to come in. Make a mental note: After breakfast, kill the cat. Annabel in 
England, who is on her eighth month of not smoking, e-mails you. "Don't worry," 
she says, "you will learn to concentrate, and you can write without smoking." 
</P>
<P>
 You decide she is lying but resolve to stay more relaxed today, focusing on 
the positives: No more wheezing attacks. Some occasional coughing, but that's a 
good sign -- the cilia are coming back to life, doing their job. Mouth tastes 
fresh, skin looks healthier; have more energy. Getting to know Dave Letterman, 
and he's actually a warm, nurturing person, very misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
 You decide to try a stick of cinnamon, as recommended. Holding it like a 
cigarette, you put it to your mouth and take a drag, throwing your head back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't I look like Lauren Bacall in 'Key Largo'? " you ask your husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "Didn't Bogie die of lung cancer?" he responds. 
</P>
<P>
 You "smoke" the cinnamon stick all morning, taking deep breaths, and for a 
little while -- maybe half an hour -- you are able to concentrate. In the 
afternoon you take an hourlong fast walk. You feel great. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhausted, you fall asleep at 10:30. 
</P>
<P>
 FRIDAY 
</P>
<P>
 Dreamed you smoked two cigarettes in a row and enjoyed it. Wake up feeling 
depressed and hungry. Eat two big bowls of oatmeal. Discover a butt in the jade 
plant -- your old hiding place -- and hold it in your hand, imagining how it 
would feel to smoke it: the instant relief, the calm. Then you smell it and 
remember the coughing, the wheezing attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 It occurs to you that smoking never improved your life in any way -- that 
stress and frustration come and go, whether you smoke or not. You throw the 
butt in the trash, then log onto the Internet, where you read this message: "I 
quit smoking one year ago and feel great! How to do it? There are no miracles, 
no easy answers. At first it's very hard, but it gets easier every day. Set 
your mind to other things. Keep busy, drink lots of water, eat good healthy 
food, and exercise. When tempted to smoke, remember how awful you felt when you 
smoked, and how much you don't want to go through quitting again. Look around 
and let everything you see take much of your attention. Good luck, and peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside your office window, a hummingbird buzzes the poinsettia, its 
iridescent throat flashing bright colors in the sunlight. You take a deep 
breath and turn to your work, resolved. Next thing you know the morning has 
passed, and you have the beginning of a first draft.

NIGHT LIFE: NATTY BOOGIE-WOOGIE PIANIST ROB RIO STARTS THE WEEK WELL; ABOUT AS 
GOOD AS THEY GET THESE DAYS, HE DUDES IT IN A SUIT LIBERACE WOULD HAVE

<P>
 Nobody likes Mondays. It's the first day of work, and there are still four 
more days to go. Television offers the usual: "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine" or 
Monday Night Football. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a viable option this week as boogie-woogie piano whiz Rob Rio 
tenaciously tickles some ivories, which in turn will shake some booties all 
over the large dance floor at Nicholby's in Ventura. OK, "Deep Space Nine" 
really is a cool show, but that's why they make VCRs. 
</P>
<P>
 Boogie-woogie is "conducive to dancing," understates Webster's. It's rock 'n' 
roll blues played on a piano. And if more blues were like this, there'd be more 
blues fans. Boogie-woogie became popular in the '30s with players like Meade 
Lux Lewis and Albert Ammons. 
</P>
<P>
 Rio, who is about as good as they get these days, dresses in a suit Liberace 
would have committed crimes to wear. He has a number of albums, most on his own 
Boss Productions label. The new one is "Fine Young Girl." His songs cover the 
usual blues bases -- cars he's never going to drive, girls he's never going to 
have or girls he's never going to get rid of. Rio has a pleasing bluesy voice, 
a Lestat smile, a flamboyant style and a tight band. He talked things over by 
phone from his day job in the Valley and even broke into a theme song 
momentarily. 
</P>
<P>
 How long has "Fine Young Girl" been out? 
</P>
<P>
 It's been out about three weeks now. (Sings) "Fine young girl, why do you look 
at me that way? Now you're giving me ideas that would turn your poor mother 
gray." This is my sixth album. The first one is out of print, the other five 
are available, the last two on CD. Billy Boy Arnold recorded "Fine Young Girl" 
on his last album on Alligator. I played on that one, plus a couple of other 
songs, too. 
</P>
<P>
 At the last Ojai Bowlful, you were a solo; do you still play with a band? 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, I still play with the Revolvers -- it's a revolving band, whoever's 
available for the gig. I try to keep the same rhythm section, then sometimes 
I'll hire a guitar player or a horn player. At the Nicholby's gig, we'll be a 
trio. I just finished playing the Avila Beach Blues Festival with James Cotton 
and John Mayall. Just like at Ojai, I was one of the warm-up artists, which is 
a good gig for me. I'm reasonably priced, and I put on a high-energy show. 
</P>
<P>
 Are Alligator, Black Top and Rounder about the only options for you as far as 
getting signed? 
</P>
<P>
 Probably, because the type of music I play there's only a few small blues 
labels, and those labels want artists that'll go out on the road and flog their 
new record. I'll go to Phoenix, or maybe Colorado, but I don't like extended 
road trips. You become a prisoner in a van. I did go to Europe three times this 
year, mostly to France. There, they treat you like royalty. Here, they treat 
you like a busboy. 
</P>
<P>
 So that endless blues tour isn't right for you? 
</P>
<P>
 No, I play two or three times a week. My body can't handle the rigors of 
playing because I expend so much energy. The next day, I feel like someone beat 
me up. I can't do that five nights a week. 
</P>
<P>
 You sell your stuff at your gigs then? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, plus I sell a lot of stuff on the East Coast through mail order. No one 
tells me what to record or how to present my music. The type of music I play is 
especially conducive to swing dancers, and I sell stuff through the swing 
dancers' network. Santa Barbara has a good swing dancing scene. 
</P>
<P>
 What's boogie-woogie music? 
</P>
<P>
 Boogie-woogie is a uniquely American form of early blues piano characterized 
by a steady percolating left hand while the right hand plays syncopated riffs. 
Boogie-woogie is something that will never die, even though it may never reach 
a mainstream audience. When I play, boogie-woogie piano players seem to come 
out of the woodwork. There's a few excellent players out there, but not that 
many, maybe four or five in the States and four or five in Europe. Right now, 
I'm working on a boogie-woogie instructional manual. 
</P>
<P>
 What's your particular style? 
</P>
<P>
 It's upbeat jump blues influenced by West Coast blues from the '50s. It's more 
of a jump blues as opposed to Chicago blues or Delta blues or East Coast blues. 
I do about 40% originals and the rest covers. My music is pretty eclectic -- 
gospel, blues with some poppy riffs. I try to appeal to everybody. I get young 
kids at my shows and older people that remember the old boogie-woogie guys. 
</P>
<P>
 You still dress to impress while rockers are slobs with baseball caps on 
backward. Is there a dress code? 
</P>
<P>
 It goes with the tradition of the blues from the '30s and '40s. There's no 
excuse to have a hair out of place. It's just tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 When did you start playing piano? 
</P>
<P>
 I started when I was 8 years old. If you do anything for 20 or 25 years, you 
better know a little something about it, or else give it up. Details

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; VAMPIRE LEGENDS STILL HAUNT BIG SCREEN; A UC 
SANTA BARBARA RESEARCHER HAS CHRONICLED THEIR HISTORY IN AN 850-PAGE 
'ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THE UNDEAD.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PANCHO DOLL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even if you don't believe in the occult, you have to admit that the existence 
of vampires in film and literature is deathless. 
</P>
<P>
 "Interview with the Vampire," the latest cinematic incarnation of the 
3,000-year-old myth, is one of the few portrayals not covered in J. Gordon 
Melton's just published "The Vampire Book: An Encyclopedia of the Undead." 
</P>
<P>
 Melton, a member of the UC Santa Barbara religious studies staff and author of 
books on religion in America, started the 850-page encyclopedia two years ago 
when Francis Ford Coppola's "Bram Stoker's Dracula" came out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually with my books I'm happy if the first printing of 2,000 sells out," 
Melton said. "This had a printing of 10,000 and sold out in the first two 
weeks." It's now in a second printing. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted an odd connection between vampire stories and another current movie. 
According to Melton, Mary Shelley wrote what was to become "Frankenstein" 
during the same opium-soaked weekend in Geneva when the modern version of 
Dracula was penned. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Shelley and her husband, Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, were touring 
Europe in 1816 when they found themselves snowed in at a chalet they were 
sharing with Lord Byron and several other literati, including John Polidori. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were all taking laudanum when someone suggested they each write a 
horror story, then read it aloud for everyone's amusement. Polidori wrote a 
story that was the first modern version of Dracula. Bram Stoker's didn't come 
along until 75 years later," Melton said. 
</P>
<P>
 In case you're wondering, Melton is not a believer, not in the occult anyway. 
He's a Methodist minister. 
</P>
<P>
 The high priest of ski films is showing his latest devotional work. Warren 
Miller's "Vertical Reality" drops into the Ventura Theatre on Sunday and the 
Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza on Monday to inaugurate the winter season. 
</P>
<P>
 If you've seen any of Miller's 45 previous ski spectaculars, well, here's 
another one: lots of extreme skiing on top of high-energy sound tracks, 
intercut with cameos of novice skiers doing incredibly stupid things. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a glaring plug for the corporate sponsor, but what the heck. Skiing is 
an industry like any other, so if you watch the film and are motivated to buy 
an overpriced piece of gear, you're not being self-indulgent, you're helping 
the economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Call the Ventura Theatre at 449-ARTS or the Civic Arts Plaza Auditorium at 
648-1888 for show times. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh yeah, and pray for snow. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here's another monster movie, only this is a nonfiction piece that could be 
called "Realm of the Giant Tube Worms." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not called that, though. It's called "Secrets of Underwater Volcanoes," 
part of the PBS "The New Explorers" series. 
</P>
<P>
 The explorers in this case are a husband and wife team of marine scientists 
from UC Santa Barbara. Geochemist Rachel M. Haymon and geophysicist Ken C. 
Macdonald take a submersible craft down to geothermal vents 8,000 feet beneath 
the surface of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of species (giant tube worms among them) have been identified 
thriving on the hydrogen sulfide emitted by the vents since they were 
discovered off the Galapagos Islands in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the biological curiosities, cameras caught two octopuses in the act of 
copulation. As it turned out, the animals were not only different species, but 
males. The scientists are still puzzled by the biological significance of such 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
 See if you can solve the riddle when the show is broadcast at 8 p.m. 
Wednesday.

ON THE ROAD: THE BOY WHOSE HEAD IS JAMMED FULL OF NOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD REED, Leonard Reed is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the request of a visitor, Jeffrey Paul tries to describe how he writes 
music, and his sentences are about as vague and diffuse as his compositions are 
vivid and clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "It depends on where I am," he says. "It helps to be at the piano. But 
sometimes I just write down the notes I hear in my head." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey is a senior at Thousand Oaks High School, and his head is jammed with 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like, this piece I just finished, I really didn't know it was going to be a 
fugue. I heard some themes, some motifs, and I wrote them down and then turned 
them upside down, ran them back in different keys, and it became a kind of 
contortion of ideas in which things were repeated but in different ways." 
</P>
<P>
 He pauses, recalls that he took the written music to his piano teacher. 
Together they scored the notation, played the music. Without particularly 
knowing it, Jeffrey Paul II, 16, had composed a fully realized fugue for 
four-part choir, neo-Gregorian and medieval in content and style. 
</P>
<P>
 This will come as no surprise to those who know Jeffrey. Or those, perhaps, 
who attended the first recital performed at the new Civic Arts Plaza in 
Thousand Oaks on Oct. 22 in which Jeffrey performed one of his compositions, 
"Sonata for Oboe/English Horn and Violin." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey is simply one of music's enlightened children. 
</P>
<P>
 He's not particularly struck by this fact. Instead, he's cautiously aware that 
an insatiable musicality abides in him. As a result, he spends most of his 
conscious time breathing and eating and getting through school and maintaining 
a few friendships -- and hearing and playing and writing music. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It started at 4, with piano. "I wanted to be like my dad," a physicist by 
training but jazz player at heart, Jeffrey notes. In the fourth grade, Jeffrey 
took up the difficult, double-reeded oboe "to get into band" at Acacia 
Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 While Jeffrey also would take up saxophone in the ninth grade "to get into the 
marching band" at Thousand Oaks High School, oboe would be his first 
instrument. 
</P>
<P>
 He studies under the formidable David Weiss, principal oboist with the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic, and on occasion performs in small chamber settings with 
Weiss. He is principal oboist with the Thousand Oaks High School Wind Ensemble 
and the Conejo Youth Symphony Orchestra and is guest soloist with the UC Santa 
Barbara Symphony and Goleta Valley Chamber Orchestra. Predictably, he was 
elected to the 1994 All-Southern California Honors Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 His membership in these bands virtually inhales his time, both for rehearsal 
and performances. Yet other scheduled performances on other instruments -- such 
as a solo piano performance, with orchestra, next April at Pepperdine 
University, and his frequent lead alto sax performances with the Thousand Oaks 
High School Jazz Band -- also require substantial preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Jeffrey's compositional work -- perhaps the most defining mark in 
this embryonic artist -- plunges ahead. He was honored this year by the Music 
Teachers Assn. for his symphonic composition "Fanfare and Overture," a piece 
performed by a 40-piece orchestra. (Jeffrey conducted.) He's not sure what will 
become of his neo-Gregorian fugue, but then neither is he clear on the fate of 
a fully scored aria he wrote last week as a birthday gift for a singer friend. 
All he knows is that he keeps on hearing notes, keeps on writing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey heads east this winter to audition for the conservatories to which he 
has applied. The Eastman School of Music in Rochester, N.Y., is among his top 
choices, but then Jeffrey Paul is the sort of guy who presumes nothing. He 
simply wants to follow his music and ultimately perform with a major orchestra 
and be able to write great music. 
</P>
<P>
 He's heard of rock 'n' roll. "It has a feeling too, and I like it if I want to 
party, but there's classical that's better party music," he says. He reveals 
himself most on the subject of Hungarian composer-pianist Franz Lizst, whose 
music, he says, "carries so much emotion, so much power" and whose "technical 
facility is topped by so much heart and soul." 
</P>
<P>
 It's clear that Jeffrey Paul has both, the facility and the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask him why he does it: why music at age 16 defines his existence. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, this otherwise eloquent young fellow is at a loss for words -- and, 
perhaps, storage space for notes. The notes are his first language, after all, 
and it seems under their power that Jeffrey smiles and suddenly casts a true 
jewel of a sentence: "I'd have to pick up a horn to tell you."

FOR THE KIDS; DANCE TO 'THE VELVETEEN RABBIT'; OBERLIN TROUPE PUTS ON FUN, 
RELAXED VERSION OF THE CLASSIC CHILDREN'S STORY, TO BE STAGED SATURDAY IN 
OXNARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 "The Velveteen Rabbit," that tender, thoughtful story about a boy and his 
beloved stuffed bunny, comes to Ventura County this weekend as a dance 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't expect classical ballet with tutus and toe shoes -- this is far from 
it. The San Francisco-based Oberlin Dance Company has put together a fun, 
relaxed version of the classic children's story. 
</P>
<P>
 The modern dance company -- joined by seven local children -- takes to the 
stage at 3 p.m. Saturday at the Oxnard Civic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 The story will be easy for children to follow because a taped narration of 
Margery Williams' popular 1922 book accompanies the dancing. The narrator is 
integrated into the performance at the beginning as the odd-looking character 
on stage whose head looks like an old phonograph. 
</P>
<P>
 That's only one of the quirky little twists that the company has put on the 
old story. The venerable Nana, who controls the nursery where the boy spends 
much of his time, is literally 11 feet tall. She is actually two people, one 
atop the other's shoulders -- all hidden, of course, so the illusion makes the 
other characters seem smaller. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Sanchez, formerly with the Twyla Tharp dance company, plays the unnamed 
boy, romping about the stage, constantly in movement. He slides, rolls, leaps 
and even does flips. He's spirited, athletic, loose, but at the same time a 
graceful and technically skilled dancer. 
</P>
<P>
 And the rabbit, kids will want to take him home. Actually, a her in this case; 
she's played by Heather Tietsort, wearing a full-headed mask with pink satin 
ears that continually twitch. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy grows to love the bunny, playing with it constantly, taking it 
everywhere. They sleep curled up together. He tosses it in the air and hugs it 
exuberantly. All that collapses when the boy gets sick and the bunny wrestles 
with how he can become a real rabbit like the ones he meets in the woods. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven Ventura County children, ages 8 to 13, will join the 11-member cast for 
the show, as well as performances for local schools. They auditioned for small 
parts that are interspersed throughout the production. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been the troupe's practice to bring local children into its performances 
in each city. Here they are Kristin Mattavich, 13; Courtney Dickmann, 10; 
Alexandra Kravitz and Danielle Sharaga, both 8; Eric Davis, 11; Hallie Drake, 
12, and Jennifer Whalen, 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are woven throughout the ballet," often acting as the boy's feelings and 
thoughts, Pilkenton said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are gaps in the narration where the dancing is the only thing going on. 
Some of it is abstract and symbolic, but it is so lively it should keep the 
kids attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is slightly more than an hour, not including an intermission. The 
musical accompaniment is taped, composed by Benjamin Britten, with songs by Bob 
Franke and Gunnar Madsen. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a new twist on the old swap meet idea. The Conejo Recreation and Park 
District is holding a kids swap meet Saturday at the Thousand Oaks Community 
Center, 2525 N. Moorpark Road. 
</P>
<P>
 It's for kids 6 through 12 who want to make a little money by unloading old 
games, toys, sports equipment, clothes or books. The idea was so popular that 
the district has already sold out the 100 spaces it was offering to kids for $2 
each. 
</P>
<P>
 The swap meet runs from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Oberlin Dance Company's production of "The Velveteen Rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Saturday, 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Oxnard Civic Auditorium, 900 Hobson Way. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOW MUCH: $12 for children, $14 for adults. To charge tickets by phone, call

FASHION; TAKING HATS TO HEART; PACHARA STARTED OUT CRAFTING MILLINERY AT HER 
KITCHEN TABLE. NOW IT'S A CAREER AND CREATIVE OUTLET FOR HER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN WILLIAMS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Pachara came to California from New York City in the 1980s, 200 hats came 
with her. This was long before she launched her business designing and selling 
women's hats; this was her personal collection. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would you leave the house without a hat?" asks Pachara, a 
third-generation milliner. "I wear a hat every day of my life. I don't care if 
you want to walk out in black jeans and black cowboy boots, you can still wear 
an elegant hat." 
</P>
<P>
 In the studio in her Thousand Oaks home, the designer is finishing towers of 
handmade cloches for her next show. She is focusing on brown this week, and is 
steaming feather-light mocha straw into head-hugging shapes for trimming. 
</P>
<P>
 A mound of tawny-dyed chiffon flowers lies ready for her touch. "I never know 
how this is going to come out when I'm doing it," she says. "I dip them in tea 
sometimes to get what I want." 
</P>
<P>
 It was destined that this woman design hats; but alas, her family missed the 
cues. While Pachara's mother and great aunt spent their careers joyfully 
bringing hats into the world, Pachara was sent off to college to earn an 
accounting degree. 
</P>
<P>
 In her life as an accountant, Pachara had a traditional first and last name, 
which she discarded when the artist within finally took command. This is the 
Pachara who came West, where she worked at the film studios, supported a son 
and daughter through college and volunteered as an art curator for the Los 
Angeles Urban League. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, four years ago, Pachara found her true calling when she lost her 
accounting job due to downsizing at Columbia Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Pachara had long made herself hats in her kitchen, using a tea kettle to steam 
them into shape, and afterward adding whatever ornaments were on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Minus an income, she made up a quantity of old-fashioned straw and cotton hats 
trimmed with the wool of old sweaters, feathers and beads and inspired by 
styles of the 1920s and '30s. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter said, 'Nobody's going to buy those!' " Pachara recalls. "All of a 
sudden, they were gone -- and I decided to go into business." 
</P>
<P>
 Business, to Pachara, did not mean setting up a shop. Formerly married to a 
painter, she was familiar with the art circuit, and began entering her work in 
shows, not discouraged then that there was no category for her skill -- or that 
many organizers didn't know what millinery was. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the application (to the shows) says 'fine art only, no crafts,' I send 
slides and I have been getting in," Pachara says. 
</P>
<P>
 Two or three times a month, she takes her hats on the road to places such as 
Carmel, the Bay Area, La Quinta and Tempe, Ariz. Last month she entered Artwalk 
'94 at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had all the artists around me selling their $20,000 paintings . . . and 
they are all sitting there looking at me because all the husbands are looking 
at artwork, and all the women are in my space playing," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 At shows, Pachara is careful to match hats to wearers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't allow people to just come in and try on a hat and run out," she says. 
"They will put the wrong hat on. I can't wait to get near them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I match the vibrance, the whole glow of their face and hair color and skin 
tone -- so everything they wear, it matches. It can go from a wedding to the 
pool." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Pachara says, women need help in choosing a hat large enough to give 
them freedom and avoid giving them "hat hair." She demonstrates for customers, 
showing them how to wear a hat low over the forehead. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter tells me, 'One of these days one of these ladies will hit you," 
Pachara says, amused. 
</P>
<P>
 But somebody has to help the hatless. Pachara believes that women, especially 
Californians, need guidance in the whole concept of wearing a hat. They try one 
on and immediately feel conspicuous and unsure of themselves, the designer 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eighty percent of wearing a hat is hat mentality," she says. "A woman with a 
lot of self confidence -- she will walk out with six hats." 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping a show schedule is not easy. Next month Pachara plans a local open 
house, but she's far from ready to settle down in a shop. Already, she has 
turned down an offer to sell her hats through a Los Angeles boutique. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'I don't work in large quantities, but we can talk,' " says Pachara. 
She said, 'Well, I want two with that color without those flowers and with one 
of this . . .' I never called her back. You're not going to walk in and tell a 
fine artist what colors to use in a painting!" 
</P>
<P>
 Her work is a way of life. Pachara sits down in her studio at dawn, and might 
work 12 hours. She may expand the color palette, or try new decorations from

 When she finishes a hat, her label goes in the crown, avoiding a fixed 
orientation of front and back, because, Pachara says, "How do we know who we 
are going to be tomorrow?"

<P>
 After a tour of her studio, a visitor points out to Pachara how lucky she is 
to have entered the millinery field just when fashion has brought hats back 
into vogue. 
</P>
<P>
 The designer appears not to comprehend. Her answer is ready, delivered with 
even more than her usual assurance.

 "Hats," she says with a level look, "never left." Details

JAUNTS; TAKE A SPIN AROUND HARBOR; RENT AN ELECTRIC- POWERED PARTY BOAT FOR A 
CRUISE. IT HOLDS UP TO EIGHT PEOPLE, WITH FOOD AND OTHER AMENITIES AVAILABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The holiday season is almost here and, if you're strapped for something new 
and different to do with visiting relatives, here's an idea: Take them for a 
spin around the Channel Islands Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 So you don't have a boat? No problem. You can rent an electric-powered party 
boat, take the wheel yourself and cruise the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call it the golf cart of boating," said Connie Hutson, owner of the 
18-foot-long party boat that she rents under the business Easy Cruisin'. 
</P>
<P>
 The boat, with its blue awning, holds up to eight people who can schmooze and 
picnic while they see the harbor from the water, instead of from the shore. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutson launched the business in June from Harbor Landing, offering half-hour 
jaunts for $25 or hourlong trips for $45. For $70, she can gussy up the boat 
with a food tray, wine and roses for what she calls the romance package. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the boat has spawned at least one romance, she said. A young man 
surprised his girlfriend with a wedding proposal while on a harbor cruise. He 
hired an airplane to fly overhead with a banner that read "Marry Me Patty." 
</P>
<P>
 "He came back with a thumbs-up sign and she was beaming," Hutson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of piloting an 18-foot boat might sound a little intimidating to 
anyone who has never driven a boat, much less in a busy harbor of more than 
2,000 craft. It is, at first. But the speed limit in the harbor is only 5 
m.p.h. and the boat doesn't go any faster than that anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to get out of the way," Hutson said. "Even if you bump into 
something, it's not going fast enough (to cause much of an impact)." So far, 
that hasn't happened, although she worried about it when she first launched the 
$16,000 boat. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't expect the roar of an engine when you turn on the ignition. With the 
battery-operated motor, the boat hardly makes a sound. Except for a slight 
vibration, you won't know that it's really on. That makes it easier to hear the 
radio or tapes that Hutson supplies for the cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 Once on the water, you can ogle the fishing boats and yachts docked along the 
shore. You can also explore the many fingers in the harbor and peruse the 
pricey homes on the water's edge. The boat turns on a dime, so it isn't 
difficult to turn around at the end of an inlet. 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers sit on cushioned seats around the bow of the boat and in the stern. 
Some bring along a picnic lunch or dock in the harbor at several spots if they 
want to pick up something. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the boat out for a spin carries with it some cautionary rules: You must 
stay in the harbor, going no farther than the Whales Tail restaurant toward the 
mouth of the harbor. Stay to the right of other boats, and keep in mind that 
sailboats have the right of way. If there is a problem, Hutson keeps a cellular 
phone on board. 
</P>
<P>
 Landing the boat at the end of the cruise is a little tricky. You turn off the 
engine and coast toward the dock at Harbor Landing. Hutson or one of her crew 
will be on hand to help ease the boat alongside the dock. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Hutson works full time as general manager of the Mandalay Beach Resort, 
her daughter, Jodi, helps her run the boat business on the side. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, the boat was in high demand, she said. "We had to turn people 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 During the slower season -- now through February -- the boat is available by 
reservation seven days a week during daylight hours. Later, in the spring and 
summer, reservations aren't necessary because a crew member is on hand during 
operating hours and the boat is available on a first-come, first-served basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did Hutson get into the boat business? 
</P>
<P>
 "I live at Mandalay Bay and I love the water, so it's frustrating if you're 
not a boat owner," she said. "I looked into buying a boat, but I didn't want 
the heavy maintenance and I wasn't interested in going into the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
 She thought that surely there must be other people like her who want access to 
a boat without all the hassle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was right," she said. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Easy Cruisin' electric boat rental. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Channel Islands Harbor, Harbor Landing on the west side of the 
harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Daily, during daylight hours, by reservation. 
</P>
<P>
 * COST: $25 for half an hour, $45 for an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: For reservations, call 984-4379. Call one or two days ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 * ETC.: The boat is available for children's birthday parties. Children under 
7 must wear life jackets provided by the boat owner.

THEATER REVIEW; UPBEAT MUSIC A DRAG ON 'THE GOODBYE GIRL'; LOBERO THEATRE 
PRODUCTION HAS UPLIFTING MOMENTS, HELPED MOSTLY BY TORI PONDER'S STELLAR LEAD 
PERFORMANCE. 
</P>

<P>
 Homegrown musical theater once again resounds through Santa Barbara's Lobero 
Theatre, which spawned the enormously popular Santa Barbara Civic Light Opera a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 This time around, the songs have a more up-to-date focus as the Contemporary 
Music Theatre of Santa Barbara initiates its first full season with the West 
Coast Premiere of "The Goodbye Girl." 
</P>
<P>
 Adapted from Neil Simon's comedy of the same name, it's about unlikely 
opposites trading insults as they're forced to share a New York apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Something about the goofy schmaltz of the original play and movie led Simon 
and his co-conspirator, composer Marvin Hamlisch, to conclude that a musical 
adaptation was a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 What they churned out was an innocuous and unmemorable bit of fluff that 
nevertheless has its share of uplifting moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these are made possible by a notably sharp and effecting performance 
by Tori Ponder in the title role. Under the healing influence of blossoming 
romance, her Paula convincingly grows from brittle, sarcastic pessimist to an 
admirably mature, self-reliant person capable of giving and receiving love. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a smooth transition, mind you -- the road zigzags through the 
neurotic twists and turns that establish this as a "contemporary" musical. As 
Paula teeters between insulated loneliness and taking risks with her feelings, 
Neil Simon's masterful knack for mining trendy currents is clearly evident. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many of the satirical barbs that helped establish Simon as "phrasemaker to 
the stars" are blunted in Hamlisch's score, relentlessly upbeat pop reminiscent 
of a "Love, American Style" soundtrack. Musical director David Potter 
faithfully reproduces every Bubblicious note. 
</P>
<P>
 David Zippel's lyrics (uncredited in the program) try to marry this musical 
mush with Simon's signature cleverness ("My built-in woman's radar only zeros 
in on zeros"), and Ponder somehow manages to make it appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Ponder's Paula is a delight, Craig Woolson is woefully miscast as 
Elliot, the mantra-chanting, guitar-strumming actor who worms his way past her 
defenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliot's eccentricity goes no further than sporting a good-natured grunge 
look, yet we're expected to believe he's really a gifted actor forced to commit 
professional suicide in an off-off-Broadway production reinterpreting Richard 
III as an Elizabethan Tinker Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 His phenomenally bad play-within-a-play worked fine in its original context, 
but the satire is way too literary and specialized here. On the sprightly, 
precocious side, Alexandra Currie as Paula's clear-sighted daughter scores high 
marks for dialogue, though some of the role's singing range proves elusive. 
</P>
<P>
 Director/choreographer Michele Spears is committed to presenting the complete 
"Goodbye Girl" experience -- all two hours and 40 minutes of it. But there just 
isn't enough in this flimsy vehicle to warrant more than a two-hour run. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, die-hard Neil Simon fans might feel differently. The only objective 
criteria for judging a show like this is to count the number of times you check 
your program to see how many songs are left. I hope you get better results than 
I did. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "The Goodbye Girl." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Through Nov. 27, 8 p.m. Wednesdays through Saturdays, 2 p.m. Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Lobero Theatre, 33 E. Canon Perdido St., Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOW MUCH: $16.50-$18.50.

GOINGS ON; HOLLY NEAR IS SINGING FOR A NEW GENERATION; SHE'LL BE IN CONCERT TO 
HELP THE FUND FOR SANTA BARBARA. HER MUSIC HAS EVOLVED ALONG WITH HER CHANGING 
LISTENERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After more than two decades on the music scene, singer-activist Holly Near 
sees herself as a grandmother of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people come up to me and say they've been coming to my concerts for 
22 years, which is how long I've been doing them," she said. "But I've also got 
22-year-olds coming up holding their babies, who say, 'My parents raised me on 
your music and now I'm raising my children on your music.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Near will likely attract that range of audience to her fund-raising concert 
Sunday at Santa Barbara's Victoria Hall. The proceeds will benefit the Fund for 
Santa Barbara, which assists social, economic and environmental groups, 
organizations close to Near's heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who come to my concerts are committed to the community on one 
level or another, to some kind of humanitarianism," she said. "In general, 
there is a belief in peace and harmony and respect and children -- all those 
kinds of good things." 
</P>
<P>
 Those good things have always been concerns for Near's audiences, but there 
has been some evolution, she said, since the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a maturity that's happened. You can go back to the '70s and 
find people who were in the peace movement but opposed to feminism, or people 
who worked for animal rights who didn't know anything about children," she 
said. "People now may have a broader spectrum. I think there's an overall 
greater understanding, tolerance and compassion, even though we are living in a 
time when there's more violence and intolerance than ever." 
</P>
<P>
 As the audience has evolved, so has Near's music. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to be getting more and more diverse, everything from what people 
would describe as commentary folk music, to jazz interpretations of love songs, 
to musical theater, to show tunes, to standards of the '30s and '40s," she 
said. "It sounds like a hodgepodge, but it becomes kind of a quilt." 
</P>
<P>
 Near's concert will begin at 7:30 p.m. Tickets are $25 and $100 (which 
includes a preconcert party and preferred seating). Tickets are available 
locally at the Ventura Bookstore or by calling the Arlington Theater box office 
at 963-4408. Victoria Hall is at 33 W. Victoria St.

 The Santa Barbara Civic Light Opera will present the Andrew Lloyd Webber-Tim 
Rice collaboration "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat" on Friday

Testament story of Jacob's son Joseph and his coat of many colors, stars 
theater and television veteran Brian L. Green. 
</P>
<P>

multiple personality disorders. The women tell their own stories with the help 
of home movies, photos, and enactments of dreams and memories. The film, which 
won the Sundance Film Festival's 1994 Spirit of Freedom Award, will begin at 7 
p.m. General admission is $5 at the door. The theater is at 960 Embarcadero del 
Norte.

ROCK TALK; COVER CHARGE ALMOST KILLED THE TOOL SHOW; THE BAND BALKED AT THE 
OWNER'S PLAN TO CHARGE THE UNDER-21 CROWD AN EXTRA $5 TO MAKE UP FOR THE 
TWO-DRINK MINIMUM. IN THE END, THE SURCHARGE WAS WAIVED.

 Opposites don't always attract; usually they fight. And odds are, it won't be 
even, much less pretty. Husbands and wives, dogs and cats, jocks and dorks, 
UCLA and USC, bands and club owners -- all natural enemies. For bands, one of 
the few things members agree on is that they have a common enemy -- the club 
owner. He, in turn, sees the pompous, no-talent rock star as just a necessary, 
but noisy, evil. 
</P>
<P>
 The implicit danger is obvious when it comes to writing in the past tense 
about something that hasn't happened yet. But the sold-out Tool show at the 
Ventura Theatre last Tuesday almost didn't happen. It was on, then off, then on 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Tools' 1993 debut album went gold, plus they have some award-winning videos 
and a bunch of fans, if no new music. The show, nonetheless, three-fourths sold 
out at the time, was canceled on the afternoon of Nov. 4. It was resurrected on 
the following Tuesday, or in plenty of time to get left out of the listings, 
when venue owner Gary Folgner decided to waive a surcharge aimed at the 
nondrinking under-aged. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Peter Reidling, Tool's tour manager, it was the same old story: 
</P>
<P>
 "On Friday, there was a dispute about charging everyone under 21 five extra 
dollars for a two-drink minimum. We don't think it's right to charge an extra 
$5; it's just not fair. It was a band and management decision to cancel the 
show, and we left it up to them. They got back to us, and the show is back on. 
The show is going to sell out, and they're going to make plenty of money, 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 But according to Ventura Theatre manager, Tom Welton, it was the same old 
story: 
</P>
<P>
 "They were crying about the two-drink minimum, because they weren't getting a 
piece of it. They're trying to tell us how to run our business, which is like 
us telling them what songs to play. Also, it's not like we're charging people 
five bucks and they're not getting anything for it. We've had this policy for 
two or three years. We're not going to make any money off this show, anyway, 
because most of the people will be underage, and they can't drink. 
</P>
<P>
 "After spending 15 bucks to get in, then another 15 for a T-shirt, they don't 
have any money left. A lot of times, if the kids don't have the extra five 
bucks, we let 'em in, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It costs us approximately $6,800 just to open the doors. We have to pay 
sound, lights, box office, security, rent, ASCAP and advertising, plus for 
Tool, we're going to have to spend $1,500 for extra security. It only costs $2 
or $3 to make a T-shirt, so if they really cared about their fans, they'd have 
cheaper T-shirts, and they would let people record the show like the Grateful 
Dead and Phish do." 
</P>
<P>
 But according to Toby Emery, the raging part of local rockers Raging Arb & the 
Redheads, it was the same old story: 
</P>
<P>
 "The theater is the only place where kids can go to see a band. But, if 
they're going to drop the $5 charge for some national touring act, then why not 
do it for the locals?" 
</P>
<P>
 I think I'll wait for the free Tool show fueled by free beer with bouncers 
washing my car with Tool T-shirts. 
</P>

 The Voodoo Lounge in Santa Barbara, a venue that has had more names than Mr. 
Elizabeth Taylor, is heading south of the border without changing its address. 
Formerly, the Beach House, the Beach Shack, the Pacific Coast Dance Company, 
Collage and, for a moment, Moments. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Darren the Manager, it's the very principle we learned in 
Economics 101: "Money. We wanna be successful. We were making money, but not 
enough. We weren't cutting it. This way, we'll be the only fish in the pond. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've already starting on Spanish radio stations and we'll have live bands 
four nights a week, Thursday through Sunday. The first band will be Grupo 
Atrevido tonight. We're bringing a little bit of Mexico back to Santa Barbara. 
Now you can go on vacation without leaving your own town." 
</P>
<P>
 Directly across the street, you can still get a great burrito or chicken 
tamale at Mac's -- not much dancing, but no bouncers and great food. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the parking lot, the Calypso on State Street, formerly the Ketch, has 
become Collapse-o as far as live music goes. Now it's reggae on Thursdays, DJs 
and worse the rest of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 For live rock music, the jumpin' part of State Street is barely twitching with 
Alex's Cantina, Toes Tavern and Joseppi's. According to Joey the Manager at 
Alex's: "This is the worst I've ever seen it. We'll have to wait until spring 
and see what happens."

 Circus Frequency had been the Next Big Thing, not as long as the Cubs, but 
seemingly for their entire existence. Losing the recent Battle of the Bands 
didn't help, according to Jeff Rodgers, the drummer of the nearly former band. 
</P>
<P>
 "That Battle of the Bands probably kept us together a little longer, but we no 
longer exist, Rodgers said, adding that singer Kirsten Candy left "because she 
didn't like the direction the music was going. The sound was too hard, and she 
wanted it to stay more mellow." 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been going on for a couple of years. We're doing one more show on 
Dec. 2 at Alex's Cantina, sort of a death-of-a-band show. But all the musicians 
of the band are still together, so in the meantime, we're looking for singers, 
male of female." 
</P>
<P>
 Want to be a singer in a rock 'n' roll band? Call Rodgers at 569-5018.

 It is downright difficult not to like Italian food. Besides being wonderfully 
varied and flavorful, it is also much healthier than the cuisine of countries 
bordering Italy, such as France or Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 Nutritionists are now extolling the virtues of more vegetables and the complex 
carbohydrates found in pasta -- items the Italians have specialized in since 
ancient Rome and later when, as the legend goes, Marco Polo brought back those 
newfangled noodles from China. 
</P>
<P>
 The big problem is finding good Italian restaurants in Ventura County, where 
the places seem to change hands faster than I change shirts. Affable Giovanni 
Tromba is a seasoned restaurateur who owns the well-regarded Giovanni's in 
Camarillo and is part owner of all three Pastabilities around the county. 
</P>
<P>
 My favorite is the Pastabilities in the attractive Water Court in Westlake, 
where Signor Tromba spends much of his time, and his son works evenings as a 
waiter. 
</P>
<P>
 The small restaurant has large windows overlooking the duck-filled ponds and a 
nice alfresco patio area, which is heated nightly with lamps. A small bar, an 
open kitchen and walls covered with canvases of local artists all contribute to 
the pleasing ambience. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you come on a Thursday night, there's live jazz to guarantee that all 
the senses are stimulated. The compact wine list has some nice Italian reds at 
easy prices. The youthful servers are well-meaning but can get bogged down at 
peak periods when Signor Tromba often lends a hand serving and clearing tables. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the antipasti , I enjoy mushrooms ($7.50) stuffed with a heady mixture 
of ground lamb, veal and garlic in a definitive Bordelaise sauce almost as much 
as raw beef carpaccio ($7) with Parmesan and arugula. The lightly battered 
calamari ($6.50) are crisp and greaseless, and one evening's special of melted 
Brie ($6) with roasted garlic cloves and fresh grapes is a most delightful 
combination. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Caesar salad ($5.50) needs more zip in the dressing, and the baked 
eggplant parmigiana ($5.50) turns out to be a soupy eggplant and cheese 
concoction. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, Tromba shows his winning hand with pastas -- all of which are 
served al dente and with either soup or salad. Pennette all'arrabbiata ($9.50), 
which translated means furious noodles, has a garlicky tomato sauce full of 
bacon, but it lacks sufficient red chili to show real anger. I prefer it when 
there's a knock-down battle of fiery flavors. 
</P>
<P>
 Much better is the capellini Sicilia ($10), in which angel hair is tossed in 
pine nuts, sun-dried tomatoes and pesto. I highly recommend both the tender 
gnocchi with fat chunks of crab ($11) and flat noodles in a creamy mushroom 
sauce ($9.50). 
</P>
<P>
 Spaghetti alla puttanesca ($9.50) means pasta in a harlot's style. Allegedly, 
the dish evolved in the kitchens of Neapolitan bordellos, where the 
disreputable ladies, ravenous after a hard night's work, would gather in the 
wee hours and throw together whatever was left over in the kitchen. Here, it's 
served in a delightful rich sauce of capers, tomatoes, black and green olives, 
and plenty of garlic. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm a former New Yorker and my personal barometer for pasta is how noodles 
with white clam sauce is executed. Under Tromba's knowing guidance, the 
linguini alle vongole ($10), with a zesty, garlic-laden white wine sauce full 
of freshly steamed clams and parsley, is nearly perfect. Order a side of good 
garlic bread ($2) to mop up every last drop of the pungent clam sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Entrees are also served with soup or salad, and among my favorites are a 
succulent breast of chicken stuffed with Gorgonzola and spinach ($14), salmon 
filet filled with shrimp and crab and topped with a light saffron sauce ($16), 
and tender veal simply sauteed in white wine and lemon ($15). While the scampi 
($15) have a lusty sauce of artichokes and olives, the shrimp are dried out 
from overcooking. 
</P>
<P>
 For one of the most authentic rustic Italian dishes served locally, try the 
fine pork spareribs ($14), which are braised with chopped cabbage and redolent 
of rosemary and sage. 
</P>
<P>
 Desserts include commercial cheesecake, tortes and tarts ($4). Instead, I 
prefer having good espresso ($1.50) and some vin santo or port while gazing out 
at the illuminated fountains in the Water Court gardens. After such a pleasant 
and authentic meal, I can easily visualize the Fontana di Trevi. Details

 Dennis Ofsthun, co-owner of Rib Tickler's BBQ in Saticoy (formerly Mario's 
Mexican Restaurant), took several styles of his Rib Tickler's barbecue sauce to 
Missouri last month for the annual American Royal Barbecue competition. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned with the Tastemaster's Choice Award, an honor awarded by contest 
founder Ardie Davis, who ranked the original version of the sauce as a personal 
favorite from among the 300 or so entrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Ofsthun, who made a name for himself and the sauce in Gig Harbor, Wash., moved 
to Camarillo a year ago. Last May, he teamed with Marco Gonzalez, a former 
owner of Mario's, in the Rib Tickler's Mexican-barbecue venture. Rib Ticklers 
BBQ is at 11012 Violeta St.

 Starbucks Coffee opened a shop Friday at Camarillo's Las Posas Plaza. The 
address is 540 Las Posas Road.

</P>
<P>
 And a new Baja Fresh Mexican Grill opened Nov. 1 at 2373 N. Oxnard Blvd. in 
Oxnard. The seventh restaurant in the nearly five-year-old chain continues in 
the tradition of serving the skinless, lardless, low cholesterol, fresh food of 
its predecessors. Unlike its siblings, however, it is the first Baja Fresh to 
be franchised. Other restaurants in the chain are in Newbury Park, Simi Valley, 
Westlake, Camarillo, Woodland Hills and Beverly Hills.

 Today, the third Thursday in November, is the day the French government 
traditionally releases its new Beaujolais. And, if all goes well, the 1994 
vintage will arrive in California in time for the Beaujolais Nouveau Dinner on 
Friday night at Capistrano's Restaurant, at the Mandalay Beach Resort in 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu for this celebration of the new wine was designed by executive chef 
Robert Garcia, with extensive input from Jean-Claude Guerin, director of food 
and beverage and a native of Burgundy, France. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fun wine to drink. You don't want a grand cuisine with a Beaujolais," 
Guerin said. "The cooking is not high-class cooking in France. It's country 
cooking like you would find in Burgundy." 
</P>
<P>
 The meal will begin with a choice pate en croute of Sonoma duck or French 
onion soup ("the soup of the poor farmer on Sundays," said Guerin). After a 
salad, comes the main course -- a choice of supreme of chicken with wild 
mushrooms or roast leg of lamb with herbs of Provence. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinner will begin at 6 p.m. The cost is $42, which includes one bottle of the 
1994 Beaujolais per couple and accordion music by John Largo. Information: 
984-2500, Ext. 569. The resort is at 2101 Mandalay Beach Road.

LIFE WITHOUT FATHER; AFTER SPLIT, ROY JONES JR. FIGHTS ON WITHOUT ROY JONES SR. 
IN HIS CORNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Roy Jones Jr. defeats James Toney in Friday night's fight at the MGM Grand, 
expect the ring to swell with the usual well-wishers and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones will want to jump into someone's arms. He will canvas the crowd and find 
a man who will hoist him. 
</P>
<P>
 It will not be the man who reared him, trained him and tested his loyalty and 
resolve to no end. It won't be the man who was in his corner for the debacle at 
Seoul, South Korea, in 1988, when Jones Jr. was robbed of the Olympic gold 
medal in his fight against Park Si Hun, the home-country favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones won't jump into the arms of the man who controlled his post-Olympic 
career and trained him through his first 19 bouts. 
</P>
<P>
 If Jones turns the lights out on Toney and captures the International Boxing 
Federation super-middleweight title, he will probably embrace Stanley Levin, a 
middle-aged lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the closest thing Jones has now to a father-son relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere in Pensacola, Fla., Roy Jones Sr. will have watched the fight on 
pay-per-view television. Father and boxer will wait for one to call the other. 
</P>
<P>
 And wait. And wait. And wait. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad because Roy Jr. will tell you his dad is a phenomenal trainer," said 
Levin, the fighter's attorney and adviser. "Roy Sr. is a good man, I like the 
man, I hurt for him, because I'm enjoying this. I'm sitting here where he 
should be sitting." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't easy handing dad his walking papers, but that's what happened in 
1992 when Jones dropped his father as his trainer-manager in a painful and 
lasting split. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Sr. was last seen in his son's corner on June 30, 1992, when Roy Jr. 
defeated Jorge Castro in Pensacola. On his own, Jones has gone on to win eight 
consecutive fights. On his own, Jones claimed the IBF middleweight title with a 
victory over Bernard Hopkins in May, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 On his own, Jones retained his title last May with a second-round knockout 
over Thomas Tate, then agreed to give up the belt to move up and challenge 
Toney. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones has a 26-0 record and some say the fastest hands in the business. Unlike 
his opponent, the tenacious and stalking Toney, Jones is a more cerebral 
fighter in the mold of Sugar Ray Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones has done quite well since life with father. But the void is undeniable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roy loves his father unequivocally," Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Approaching the most important fight of his career, Jones would not be 
side-tracked this week with questions about a sore subject. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have time to go through that right now," Jones said. "Another time. 
What really happened? We fell out." 
</P>
<P>
 Levin said the strain had been building for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 In quieter times, Jones would describe growing up under his father's iron 
glove. How his dad would drop to his knees and box his young son to test his 
character. Roy Jr. would retreat to bed crying after some of the beatings, 
represented to him at the time as training. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, if he got out of line during a workout, Jones said his father would 
rap him on the thighs with a piece of pipe. Jones considered running away but 
had no destination. Jones considered taking his life but knew that was not the 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Having survived, Jones acknowledges he emerged stronger and wiser. The torment 
no doubt made him mentally tougher as a boxer. 
</P>
<P>
 But he and his father were on a collision course. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you deal with your family, sometimes it is hard to understand," Jones 
said a few weeks ago at his training camp in Great Gorge, N.J. "Sometimes one 
person wants to be in control and then another person wants all that control." 
</P>
<P>
 Levin said he tried to warn Roy Sr. about the impending breakup.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've never done anything in the world to hurt the man," Levin said. "I told 
him what was coming. I begged him. I quit drinking a while ago, but I sat in a 
bar and drank with him and told him." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Some would argue Roy Jr. is better off without Roy Sr. The separation 
certainly has not hurt Jones in the ring. Some would argue Jones would have 
arrived sooner on the public stage had his father not held such tight reins 
early in his son's career. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, 25, has fought only 26 times since turning pro in 1989 and did not 
claim a championship until his 22nd fight. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Olympics, Jones chose not to sign with one of the sport's major 
promoters. Roy Sr. was left to chart his son's slow course up the boxing 
ladder. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurt him tremendously," Bob Arum, who is promoting Friday's fight, said. 
"You had so much network TV then, it would have given him the exposure he 
needed. He never got it, because it was impossible to deal with him and his 
father. It hurt him tremendously as far as his development as a big figure in 
boxing." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said he would not change the way his career has been handled. 
</P>
<P>
 Levin said Jones' advancement might have been slowed, but offered that it 
might have been for the better. 
</P>
<P>
 A victory over Toney would probably send Jones soaring toward superstar status 
and make him, in much of the public's mind, more than the poor kid who got 
cheated in Seoul in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 To remind him that nothing can be taken for granted, Jones occasionally 
reviews the tape of his "loss" in the 1988 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it," Jones said. "It inspires me. To me, it was one of the best 
performances in my career." 
</P>
<P>
 The only shame now is that Jones and his father cannot share Friday together, 
win or lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the two rarely speak, Roy Jr. appeared to extend an olive branch when 
he dedicated his IBF middleweight title to his dad. 
</P>
<P>
 But to work, extensions have to be received. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of his father being man enough to say, 'You're a man,' " Levin 
said.

CHINESE WOMAN TESTS POSITIVE, MAY FACE BAN; SWIMMING: WORLD 400-METER CHAMPION 
FOUND TO HAVE USED MUSCLE-BUILDING HORMONE TESTOSTERONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Criticism of the powerful Chinese women's swimming team at September's World 
Championships in Rome gained validity Wednesday when it was announced Yang 
Aihua tested positive for the muscle-building hormone testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
 Yang, the 400-meter freestyle world champion, became the fifth Chinese swimmer 
to test positive for a banned substance in 20 months. Three were for anabolic 
steroids, one for ephedrine, a stimulant. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Yang passed a drug test in Rome, she and other Chinese swimmers were 
surprised by a random, out-of-competition test conducted a week before the 
Asian Games in Hiroshima, Japan, last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Yang, who could be banned for two years and miss the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, 
had a testosterone level of almost three times the acceptable limit. 
Testosterone is the male sex hormone. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and 17 other nations had called for a drug-testing crackdown 
after Chinese swimmers dominated in the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese coaches and officials summarily dismissed the allegations that their 
swimmers used banned substances to help produce outstanding results. 
</P>
<P>
 "It validates a lot of suspicions we've had based on what seemed to be 
circumstantial evidence," said Dennis Pursley, U.S. Swimming national team 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Richardson of Honolulu, a member of the medical commission of FINA, 
swimming's governing body, said five other Chinese swimmers tested positive in 
Japan, but results are inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something was there, (but) we don't know what it is," he said. "We're just 
trying to identify it." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson said FINA is awaiting the results from the International Olympic 
Committee-accredited laboratory in Tokyo before making any announcements. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Yang could lose her silver medal from the Asian Games, she is 
expected to keep the gold from Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 That does not bother silver medalist Cristina Teuscher, 16, of New Rochelle, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad to think someone had to cheat to win," she said. "(But) it still 
feels like a second-place swim to me." 
</P>
<P>
 For U.S. coaches, Wednesday's announcement is vindication for a poor showing 
at the World Championships. Mark Schubert, a U.S. assistant coach, said the 
swimming community refused to remain mute after doing so when East Germany's 
swimmers were dominating in the 1970s and '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 After Germany was united at the end of the Cold War, it was revealed the 
swimmers used steroids to enhance performances. Some of the East German coaches 
helped China build its women's swimming program, further fueling concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been through this all before with the GDR," said Schubert, USC's swim 
coach. "Now that we're going through it again, people have just had it." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Quick, the U.S. national coach, thinks catching Yang might help stop 
further abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is orchestrated, institutionalized cheating," he said of the 
Chinese program. "These are the same coaches who said (they) are not doing any 
steroids at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson said FINA had difficulty catching the Chinese by surprise because 
it takes a month to obtain a visa to enter the country. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why officials planned their tests for Hiroshima. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was supposed to be a surprise," Richardson said. "I guess it was."

JIM MURRAY: THE RIGHT ATTITUDE FOR GOLF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You know how most golfers are. You go to a tournament, look at the long faces, 
the strained expression, the faraway look in the eyes and you want to tap them 
on the shoulder and say, "What's the matter? The patient die?" There was more 
levity around Lincoln's deathbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe they know something you don't. The stock market just fell. The 
Communists got back in power in Russia. Maybe they just found out their wife 
ran off with their caddie. Or they lost everything in a hotel fire. 
</P>
<P>
 I have seen guys look happier going down in a mine for 10 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Then you look over at Frank Urban Zoeller and you wonder how he got in here. 
He's whistling, for crying out loud! Humming to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's another reason the pros call him "Fuzzy." I mean, doesn't he 
understand the situation? Shouldn't his hair be grayer, his muscles tenser. 
Isn't golf more about silent screaming than loud whistling? How come his mouth 
isn't dry, his lips white, his eyes staring? What's with those aviator glasses? 
Fuzzy's probably just trying to hide the bloodshot from that second 
vodka-and-tonic. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuzzy's been playing golf long enough -- 21 years as a pro -- to know the game 
is not "Saturday Night Live." But neither, he thinks, is it brain surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a sport in which you have brain surgeons at ringside, either. You 
don't have ambulances at every corner. It isn't as if these guys had to defuse 
bombs, put out oil well fires or even lay brick. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look," says Fuzzy, "we're at the most beautiful places in the world, places 
where other people pay to go to vacation. I mean, just because you have to par 
it doesn't make it Devil's Island." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuzzy notices birds are singing, palm trees swaying, the surf's up, the sun is 
out and the hardest thing you have to do is putt. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to say Fuzzy doesn't know that's a wolf in the bed. That's not 
grandma with all those teeth. Fuzzy's not Little Red Riding Hood. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, when I was taught to play, I was told the game was meant to be 
enjoyable. That's why so many people play it," Fuzzy recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Work to him was something you did at a lube rack, not a green. 
</P>
<P>
 He also plays fast. Common practice on tour these days is for everyone to take 
five hours to play a round. But when Fuzzy Zoeller and Lanny Wadkins were 
paired, they hardy paused. They could have played on horseback. 
</P>
<P>
 A reporter was seeking Fuzzy out at the Franklin Funds Shark Shootout at 
Sherwood Country Club this week. He was told Fuzzy had teed off on No. 10 half 
an hour before. Now, the average golfer who tees off on 10 these days might be 
expected to be approaching 11 or maybe on the tee at 12 in half an hour. Fuzzy 
was putting out at 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are two things that can happen when you hit a shot," reasons Fuzzy. 
"You can hit a good shot -- or you can hit a bad shot. Why wait?" Fuzzy 
believes you wait for a woman or a bus. Waiting on a putt doesn't shorten it 
any. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuzzy is one of the handful of players today with two majors to his credit. He 
is thus one of an even smaller handful who still have a chance to win all four 
majors in his career. He's got the two tough ones -- the U.S. Open and the 
Masters in the bag. 
</P>
<P>
 When Fuzzy won 10 tournaments in a little more than six years, two of them 
majors, it looked to the golf world like the second coming of Palmer. At least, 
America's new hope. But a chronic bad back kept delaying the expected and 
Fuzzy's career, so to speak, went into a sand trap. 
</P>
<P>
 Then last year, Fuzzy seemed to have blasted out. Healthy again, he was the 
man-to-beat on tour. He was second no less than six times last year. Some 
people are not second that often in a career. He was third in the British Open, 
if you please, and he was in a playoff for the Tour Championship. He won more 
than a million dollars without winning a tournament and was second in the Japan 
Open. It was a vintage Fuzzy year. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not hard to fathom the secret of Fuzzy's renaissance. He is deadly when 
the green comes into view. He was first in greens-hit-in-regulation last year 
and is second this year when he has hit greens 72.8% of the time with his 
approaches and that means 957 of them. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is another part of his game that makes Fuzzy's team one of the 
favorites at Sherwood this week and makes him one of the U.S. hopefuls for 
1995. Bear in mind all four majors were won by non-Yanks last year for almost 
the first time in anyone's memory. 
</P>
<P>
 It is his attitude that makes Fuzzy the threat to strike up the Star Spangled 
Banner. Relaxed, patient, resourceful, melodious, his calm is probably worth 
three strokes a round to Fuzzy. 
</P>
<P>
 His back might twinge but his stomach feels fine. No knots there. He might be 
the only guy in the shootout this week to notice how green the fairways are and 
how majestic the white oak lining them are and how picturesque the waterfalls. 
To which some of the others might respond, "That's easy for you to say, 
Zoeller, you're never in them! To us, they're just lateral water hazards and 
unplayable lies!" 
</P>
<P>
 There are some golfers to whom the Taj Mahal would just be a free drop. But 
Fuzzy would probably drop the club to take a picture of it. Sometimes, his 
biggest problem is not what club to use but what song to whistle. He takes more 
care with that recital than an Arthur Fiedler. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's just something I heard on the radio that morning and sometimes 
it's something from my vast musical repertoire," grins Fuzzy. He may be the 
first guy to win the British Open and, when asked what won it for him, answer: 
"I dunno. Probably, 'The Merry Widow Waltz' or 'Stars and Stripes Forever.' In 
the key of C."

THE RIVALRY; VETERANS OF THE WAR; ROLE IN THE PLAY EASES PAIN FROM INJURIES FOR 
TROJANS' MAHONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Of USC's 80 or so players suiting up for Saturday's Rose Bowl game against 
UCLA, only one knows what it feels like to defeat the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 For senior Elic Mahone, a disappointing college football career is dwindling 
to a final few Saturdays. Once thought to be a tight end or defensive end of 
great promise, Mahone instead has been injured more often than he has been fit 
the past five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 He's the only current Trojan who played in the 45-42 victory over UCLA in 
1990. USC has lost the last three in the 63-year-old series. 
</P>
<P>
 As a freshman tight end, Mahone played a key role in the game-winning 23-yard 
touchdown pass play with 16 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 "The play was to Johnnie Morton in the end zone corner, but we wanted 
one-on-one coverage on Johnnie," Mahone recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job was to run a seam route and take the safety in the other direction. I 
remember when (Todd) Marinovich called the play in the huddle, he told me: 
'It's very important you clear that safety out of there.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I did, and Johnnie beat the corner. I'll never forget that crowd (98,088 at 
the Rose Bowl) reaction. It was like the crowd was right on top of my shoulder 
pads. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crowd is really a factor in the SC-UCLA game. You're conscious of the 
ooohs and ahhhs on every play, no matter what happens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember the locker room scene, right after. We had a lot of fun in there. 
I've had a tough time at SC with injuries. . . . I'd like to end my career with 
that feeling again." 
</P>
<P>
 Mahone also remembers the pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "The game last year, that was the most painful game I've ever been involved 
in," he said of the 27-21 loss after the Trojans had a first down on the UCLA 
three with 1:16 left. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll probably remember the pain of that loss last year more than the good 
feeling of the '90 win, because it hurt so much. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I could do was just stand there and watch. To not be able to help or 
contribute in any way, it really hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Mahone, 6 feet 5 and 255 pounds, was highly recruited at Pasadena's Muir High 
in 1990. He'd played tight end and defensive end, averaging 10 tackles a game. 
</P>
<P>
 But maybe he should have taken up the decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
 As a track athlete, he ran a 10.9 100, high jumped 6-5 and long jumped 20 
feet. He was a scholastic All-American and received his public administration 
degree at USC last June. 
</P>
<P>
 He began his career as a tight end under then-coach Larry Smith, who switched 
him to defensive end in 1992. Then injuries stunted his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "My only injury-free (year) was my freshman year, the year we beat UCLA," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, he separated a shoulder and missed the middle of the season, 
returning for the last three games. 
</P>
<P>
 Then John Robinson took over the Trojans and Mahone eagerly awaited the start 
of training camp in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the first day of training camp, on my very first hit of the season, I 
severed a tendon in my shoulder," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe it. It was like, I just wasn't supposed to play. I had 
surgery and missed the whole year." 
</P>
<P>
 He recovered and managed to survive training camp this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he injured his ankle at Penn State in September. 
</P>
<P>
 "Exactly the same injury Rob Johnson has now," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was high on the outside of the ankle, the kind that takes forever to heal. 
We had a bye week after Penn State, so I was able to rest it. Then in practice 
the following week, I tweaked it again and hurt it worse than ever." 
</P>
<P>
 Mahone missed the next five games, returning to play against Washington State 
on passing downs. He also played against Arizona last week and was limping 
noticeably afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tweaked it again," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've decided I'm just going to play hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 With his fifth USC-UCLA game coming up, Mahone says he has learned one truth 
about the rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to understand that won-loss records, rankings . . . none of that has 
anything to do with this game. I know half the UCLA players, guys I see in the 
off-season on weekends, and over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always a lot of talk, you know? And it's always about who won the 
last USC-UCLA game. 
</P>
<P>
 "This game is about pride, character, self-respect, stuff like that."

ANALYSIS; BASEBALL GOES BACK TO THE BARGAINING TABLE; LABOR: OWNERS' TAX PLAN 
MIGHT BE VIEWED BY UNION AS A DISGUISED SALARY CAP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Make no mistake: The tax plan that baseball's major league owners will propose 
to the players' union today will probably be construed as a salary cap by 
another name. 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake: The same owners who refused to come off the cap to save the 
World Series aren't suddenly going to capitulate and agree to any labor 
contract that does not include a payroll ceiling and salary constraints. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are still the overriding considerations," acting Commissioner Bud Selig 
said Wednesday. "The basic parameters haven't changed. We're not trying to fool 
anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the thought of a salary cap bothers people, let's try it a different way." 
</P>
<P>
 The union has a good sense of what's coming when talks resume under special 
mediator William J. Usery in Washington today, and probably will reject it as 
the equivalent of a cap. 
</P>
<P>
 The questions then become: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Does the tax plan have flexibility that the cap didn't have? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Can Usery keep owners and players at the table, working toward a negotiated 
middle ground? 
</P>
<P>
 Usery can't dictate a settlement despite his impressive credentials and 
obvious clout as an appointee of the President. 
</P>
<P>
 He emerged from the three days of renewed bargaining in Rye Brook, N.Y., last 
week to indicate that he hoped to keep owners and players talking until they 
reached a settlement in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no indication a settlement is imminent, but Usery has clearly had a 
persuasive impact, urging both sides to rethink their positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has been tenacious about that, and that's good," Selig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Usery has also created a more civil and communicative atmosphere in which 
union leader Donald Fehr -- for the time being, at least -- is refraining from 
verbal assaults on the owners, and Fehr's sparring partner, Richard Ravitch, 
has been replaced -- at Usery's request -- as the owners' spokesman and chief 
negotiator by the more conciliatory John Harrington, chief executive officer of 
the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether all of that will contribute to a settlement isn't certain, but today's 
proposal -- even if only a cap in disguise -- still represents the first shift 
in concept or substance by the owners since they presented their salary-cap 
proposal June 14. 
</P>
<P>
 The union remains wary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some tax plans are better than a cap and some are worse," union lawyer Eugene 
Orza said. "Some are the same thing. We can't be optimistic or pessimistic 
until we see it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the tax plan has been an owners' option for several months, their 
negotiating committee was still working on the details Wednesday. The tax -- 
expected to be sizable -- would be applied to all clubs over a specified 
ceiling, with the money going to the smaller-revenue clubs, supplementing the 
same revenue-sharing formula the owners agreed to in January if linked to a 
salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 An American League owner referred to the Florida meeting at which the clubs 
reached a revenue-sharing agreement and said: "There is a strong feeling that 
the Ft. Lauderdale plan should remain the centerpiece (of the new proposal), 
with the tax plan serving as the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be ridiculous to have lost all of this money (an estimated $600 
million because of the strike) and all of those games and not come out with an 
agreement that puts strong controls on our labor costs." 
</P>
<P>
 The significance of the proposal will hinge on the size of the tax, the level 
of the expected ceiling and the willingness of both sides to negotiate from 
there. The owners quickly rejected a cap-less proposal by the union in 
September that would have applied a 1.6% tax on clubs with the 16 largest 
payrolls and 16 largest revenues. That money would have been shared with the 
smaller-revenue clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 The new proposal does not prevent the owners from ultimately implementing 
their salary-cap proposal, still technically on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington told the union last week that, barring an agreement, the owners 
will feel pressured to implement their cap in early to mid-December. The 
Washington meetings could represent one of the last opportunities for a 
negotiated settlement.

HE WINS $3.76 MILLION, THEN PLAYS GAME; PREP FOOTBALL: BORON TIGHT 
END-LINEBACKER TERRY DILL, 18, HITS THE LOTTERY AND THAT NIGHT HELPS HIS TEAM 
IMPROVE TO 8-1.

<P>
 California's newest and youngest lottery millionaire had more important things 
on his mind last week than turning in his winning ticket. The 18-year-old high 
school senior had a football game to prepare for. 
</P>
<P>
 An hour after being awakened by the news that his "quick pick" Super Lotto 
ticket was the big winner in the weekly jackpot drawing, Terry Dill was sitting 
in the local coffee shop in tiny Boron eating a traditional game-day breakfast 
with teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love football more than anything," said Dill, who won $3.76 million, or 
$135,360 a year after taxes for the next two decades. "I've been playing since 
I was 8, and I wasn't about to stop for a day just because I won the lotto. 
First things first." 
</P>
<P>
 Moments after Boron's 14-0 victory over Community Christian of Bakersfield 
last Thursday night, Dill and his parents took off from Bakersfield for a 
weekend trip to Sacramento to claim the prize. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave Terry a hug after the game like I always do, and he whispered in my 
ear that he now was ready to collect his money," said Vicky Dill, Terry's 
mother. "It had been a pretty emotional day on all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Dill, the youngest of Tharold and Vicky Dill's four children, became eligible 
to play the lottery when he turned 18 on Nov. 6. Two days later, while dining 
at the Frosted Mug restaurant where his girlfriend is a waitress, he bought his 
first four lottery tickets after finishing his hamburger and french fries. 
</P>
<P>
 On one of the tickets, Dill tried picking the six winning numbers himself. The 
other three were selected by the computer, and it was the last "quick pick" 
ticket he bought that turned out to be the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Dill received the good news early last Thursday when an older brother in 
Stockton called to say someone in Boron had the winning ticket. As Vicky Dill 
recited the numbers -- 15, 30, 34, 35, 50 and 51 -- she realized Terry had a 
perfect match. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just all screaming and yelling," she said. "It's something you just 
can't believe." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the commotion, Dill did not forget he was to meet his teammates and 
coaches at the Coffee Mug restaurant for breakfast, something the team does the 
morning before every game. 
</P>
<P>
 In Boron, a mining community of 3,000 in the Mojave Desert near Edwards Air 
Force Base, football is king. The school has lost only once the last two years, 
and the 5-foot-11, 160-pound Dill is a starting outside linebacker and tight 
end for the 8-1 Bobcats. The victory over Community Christian clinched a berth 
in the upcoming CIF Southern Section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Vicky Dill is a cook at the Coffee Mug and Terry works there part-time as a 
waiter and janitor. After informing the team of the news, Dill was told by 
Coach Paul Kostopoulos that he would have to attend school that day to be 
eligible for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although we were anxious to turn in the ticket, we are superstitious not to 
break from tradition," Vicky Dill said. "I've had two other sons who played 
football, and they always ate breakfast with the team when there was a game. My 
husband and I never miss a game. None of that was going to change." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Dill had trouble concentrating at school that day, he said his mind 
cleared when he entered the locker room at Community Christian. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I could think about was football once I got my uniform on," he said. "Our 
team really needed this win, and I wasn't going to put myself first. We're a 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 Dill and his parents left for Sacramento after the game and turned in the 
ticket Monday. Vicky Dill guarded the ticket in a fanny pack she hid under her 
blouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Dill said he is supposed to receive the first check before Christmas and plans 
to help his parents pay off their mortgage and car payments and "buy some new 
chrome rims" for his truck. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants to attend Victor Valley Junior College then study veterinary medicine 
at the University of California at Davis his junior year. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of this is reality yet," he said, "so I just have to go about my life 
like I did before."

BOWL STUFF 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the skinny on some of the behind-the-scenes bowl maneuvering: 
</P>
<P>
 --If Florida State gets frozen out of the Orange or Sugar Bowl--and it's a 
distinct possibility--the Seminoles are looking for ways to get a Fiesta 
invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem: the Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Under bowl coalition rules, the Cotton chooses before the Fiesta and probably 
would take Florida State if a 7-4 Notre Dame was unavailable. If that happens, 
the Seminoles and ACC Commissioner Gene Corrigan want to test the coalition 
contract for loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Florida State doesn't qualify for any of the current contract 
exceptions--economic reasons (sorry, the Fiesta pays less than the Cotton), 
regular-season rematch or third consecutive trip to same bowl--the Seminoles 
will need a legal opening as wide as the Florida panhandle. 
</P>
<P>
 According to one coalition source, Corrigan has been advised to find a good 
lawyer if he wants a contract interpretation. And if the issue comes to a vote 
by the coalition founding fathers, Florida State shouldn't hold its breath for 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 --Unranked Notre Dame (5-4) has to win its remaining games against Air Force 
and USC, or else the Irish will be home for the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic Director Dick Rosenthal has made no official announcement, but it 
appears Notre Dame will decline any bowl invitation unless it is 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish's agreement with the coalition says the team can play only in the 
four major alliance bowls--Cotton, Sugar, Orange and Fiesta. But in a 
compromise with mighty Notre Dame, the coalition guaranteed it a spot in one of 
the four big-money bowls if the Irish finished with seven victories. At the 
time it seemed like a safe bet, especially because Notre Dame hasn't had a 
sub-eight-victory season since 1986, Coach Lou Holtz's first season at South 
Bend. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for streaks. Now the Irish face red-hot Air Force, winner of its last 
seven games, at South Bend on Saturday and then travel to the Coliseum for a 
Nov. 26 game against the Trojans, who have won five consecutive games and six 
of their last seven. 
</P>
<P>
 A Notre Dame split doesn't do the Irish much good, even if Rosenthal changes 
his mind. The Fiesta isn't likely to take them, not when a 9-2 or 8-3 USC is 
available. The Orange is set. The same goes for the Sugar. The Cotton would be 
interested, but only if Florida State can't come to Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 --The Freedom Bowl, which has been sweating out some financial concerns, will 
live to see another game. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive Director Don Andersen said earlier this week that the Orange County 
Sports Assn., which runs the Freedom Bowl, has received the necessary line of 
credit to fund the game. That's good, because assorted Pacific 10 and Western 
Athletic Conference officials were getting a little nervous about sending their 
teams to Anaheim for no paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 --Despite its 8-2 record, Utah might be left out of the bowl mix. 
</P>
<P>
 WAC Commissioner Karl Benson is working the phones these days trying to find a 
place for the Utes, but the response hasn't been overwhelming. The ugly truth: 
</P>
<P>
 1) Utah has zero national appeal, so that rules out almost any bowl game east 
of the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Utah could fall to 8-3 with a loss Saturday to Brigham Young. If that 
happens, the Utes will probably fall out of the top 25. As recently as Oct. 30, 
they were ranked No. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 3) Quick, name two players from Utah. How about one? 
</P>
<P>
 4) The Utes need Wisconsin (5-4-1), Indiana (5-5), West Virginia (5-5) and 
Georgia (5-4) to finish their seasons without the required six Division I-A 
victories. The fewer teams available, the better Utah's chances for an 
invitation. HELLO, CENTURY 21 AGENT? 
</P>
<P>
 Here it is mid-November and already Georgia Tech's Bill Lewis, Michigan 
State's George Perles, Iowa State's Jim Walden, Mississippi's Billy Brewer, 
LSU's Curley Hallman and Ohio's Tom Lichtenberg have received their pink slips. 
Last year there were 14 Division I-A coaching changes. This year there have 
been six . . . and counting. 
</P>
<P>
 At Oklahoma, where everything is not OK, embattled Coach Gary Gibbs is telling 
reporters and his players that he won't resign--at least not now, he won't. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm focusing on Nebraska right now," said Gibbs, who has repaired Oklahoma's 
tarnished image, but gone 2-14-1 against Texas, Nebraska and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 At Ohio State, Coach John Cooper had to answer questions about Michigan 
captain Walter Smith, who told reporters in Ann Arbor this week that the 
Wolverines have one goal in mind for Saturday's game: "We want to get Cooper 
fired. That's what I want to do. We want to keep on beating them and beating 
them until he's not there." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper is 0-5-1 against archrival Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 At Kentucky, Coach Bill Curry is telling anyone who will listen that he isn't 
going anywhere. The Wildcats are 1-9 this season and were beaten by Northeast 
Louisiana, a first-year Division I-A program, last Saturday at Commonwealth 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 At Georgia, Coach Ray Goff is fighting for his job too. He says he has the 
backing of Athletic Director Vince Dooley, but if the Bulldogs lose to Georgia 
Tech on Nov. 24, who knows? 
</P>
<P>
 At Texas, Coach John Mackovic is under fire for a two-plus-season record of 
17-14-1, including two losses to Texas A&M. CENTURY 21, PART II 
</P>
<P>
 Best guesses: 
</P>
<P>
 --Gibbs is gone. Replacement possibilities might include Tulsa's Dave Rader, 
maybe even Colorado State's Sonny Lubick, though WAC officials say Lubick will 
stay put. Sure he will--until Dennis Erickson leaves Miami for, say, the 
Seattle Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
 --Cooper survives, unless he loses to Michigan again and decides to chuck the 
Buckeyes and return to his alma mater, Iowa State. 
</P>
<P>
 --Curry survives what probably will be a 1-10 season. There were rumors that 
he was leaving Kentucky to become athletic director at his alma mater, Georgia 
Tech. Untrue, said Curry, who has the continued support of C.M. Newton, 
Kentucky's powerful athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
 --Goff survives, but to be on the safe side, the Bulldogs had better beat a 
1-8 Georgia Tech team. 
</P>
<P>
 --Mackovic survives, thanks to a vote of confidence he received last week from 
Texas President Robert Berdahl. Berdahl said Mackovic had done "a good job," 
and then chided fans for thinking the football program could be rebuilt in 
three seasons. THE REST 
</P>
<P>
 There is talk at BYU that Coach LaVell Edwards, in his 23rd season at Provo, 
is considering a move to athletic director. . . . Contrary to published 
reports, Tony Dungy, Minnesota Viking defensive coordinator, said Michigan 
State never offered him the Spartan coaching job. Had the school asked him to 
replace Perles, Dungy said he probably would have declined. . . . For once, 
West Virginia Coach Don Nehlen isn't exaggerating when he says, "In my opinion, 
Boston College is playing better than anyone in our league." That league is the 
Big East and it includes No. 5 Miami. Boston College plays at Morgantown, 
W.Va., on Saturday. Miami, which has quarterback troubles again, visits Temple. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a Big Eight Conference suspension, Iowa State's Walden can't coach 
the Cyclones in his final game Saturday at Colorado. Walden, who was fined, 
reprimanded and then suspended for criticizing officials after a Nov. 5 game 
against Kansas State, originally planned to watch his team in "one place where 
you never make a mistake"--the Cyclones' radio booth. But the Big Eight said 
Walden can't be in the stadium. "It's kind of a tough way of going out after 17 
years," Walden said. . . . Pac-10 Commissioner Tom Hansen will be at Saturday's 
Oregon at Oregon State game, not USC at UCLA. . . . Ron Powlus, Notre Dame's 
redshirt freshman quarterback, still might win a Heisman Trophy, but it won't 
be this season. Powlus, who has been knocked silly this season because of a 
so-so Irish offensive line, is struggling with his role in a 5-4 Irish season. 
"Ron has never had much frustration during his life, and he had an awful lot of 
difficulty (this year)," Holtz said. "And he's going to have to handle it. I 
think wanting to be perfect is a great objective, but it's not realistic." . . 
. Wisconsin star senior running back Brent Moss, arrested for alleged 
possession of crack cocaine with intent to deliver, will not play in Saturday's 
crucial game against Illinois. A plea bargain deal to a misdemeanor is a 
possibility, but even so, Badger Coach Barry Alvarez isn't sure if he will 
allow Moss to rejoin the team should Wisconsin qualify for a bowl. One bright 
spot: Alvarez was named one of the city's 25 sexiest people by Madison 
magazine. Of course, this is the same magazine that named Moss one of the 25 
most talented. The Top 10

<P>
 Chris Miller, the Rams' $9 million quarterback, is healthy, but Coach Chuck 
Knox again made it clear he favors backup Chris Chandler as the team's starting 
quarterback, although Chandler is limping because of an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler was unable to practice Wednesday and did little more than walk on a 
treadmill. Miller, meanwhile, ran the first team offense, but became testy when 
asked if he had been told he will be the team's starting quarterback against 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chuck hasn't said anything to me," Miller said. "I'm going to prepare myself 
to play Sunday and then Chuck will make his decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox, while acknowledging the limping Chandler, said it looks as if Miller 
will start against the 49ers, but qualified his announcement by saying "at this 
point," it appears that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler, who will attempt to practice today, said he's pleased by Knox's 
confidence in him as evidenced by Knox's willingness to wait before declaring a 
starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it doesn't make it any less frustrating that the whole thing happened in 
the first place," Chandler said. "It would be nice to have it feeling real good 
(today), but we'll have to see." 
</P>
<P>
 With the number of injuries occurring at the quarterback position, the Rams 
opted to re-sign Jamie Martin and placed running back James Bostic on injured 
reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bostic, the Rams' third-round draft pick, has been listed as inactive for the 
team's first 10 games, but instead of cutting him to make room for Martin, the 
team announced a wrist injury would allow the team to keep him on injured 
reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox, asked if Bostic had injured the right wrist while holding his helmet on 
the sideline, replied good-naturedly, "He holds his helmet with his left hand, 
for your information. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's had it, it's an old fracture," Knox said. "Every time he went to block 
somebody it would bother him. There was thought of waiting until the end of the 
season to have it worked on, but we needed the roster spot." T.J. SIMERS

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; RISON SUSPENDED FOR BEING TARDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Andre Rison's troubles continue, as the Atlanta Falcons Wednesday suspended 
the wide receiver for a game without pay for being late to a team meeting. It 
will cost Rison $37,000 in lost pay. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspension comes a week after the all-pro wide receiver was critical of 
Coach June Jones and the Falcons' offense, but Jones said the only reason for 
the suspension was that Rison was late after being warned to be on time. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said he called Rison's name twice and then started the meeting without 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Rison was held out of the first quarter of a game against the Raiders on Oct. 
23 at the Coliseum for being late for the team bus. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 16, he fought on the field with former teammate Deion Sanders, and the 
NFL fined him $7,500. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Former New England Patriot owner Victor Kiam filed a $450-million lawsuit in 
New York against the NFL, saying it forced him to sell his team by denying him 
his right to move it to Florida. The suit said the NFL violated antitrust laws 
when it kept the Patriots "hostage" in Foxboro, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 The only teams not named as defendants were the Rams, Raiders, San Francisco 
49ers, New Orleans Saints and expansion Jacksonville Jaguars. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit alleged that the NFL awarded a franchise to the owners of the 
Jaguars as a payback for their agreement to stop negotiating with Kiam to 
relocate the Patriots to Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
 "But for the antitrust violation, I would today own a highly profitable 
professional football team with a current value of more than $200 million," 
Kiam said.

AN AGE-OLD CONCERN DROVE JONES TO NFL; RAIDERS: BEING HELD BACK IN GRADE SCHOOL 
PUT HIM AHEAD OF HIS PEERS, LED TO HIS EARLY DEPARTURE FROM NEBRASKA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To leave or not to leave? That can be an agonizing question for a college 
athlete trying to decide whether to jump from school to the pros before his 
senior year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some wait until the last minute. Some decide early. 
</P>
<P>
 For Calvin Jones, the determining factor came early. Really early. Would you 
believe the fourth grade? 
</P>
<P>
 Raised in Omaha, Jones struggled so much in elementary school that he was held 
back and forced to repeat the fourth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't really focused," Jones recalled. "I really didn't do the things 
necessary to go on to the next grade." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones thinks the experience taught him the value of hard work. 
</P>
<P>
 But he certainly didn't think so at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came back the following year all my classmates, they were at the next 
level, and I was still in the same class," he said. "There were new students. 
It was kind of an embarrassing thing. You really feel kind of low." 
</P>
<P>
 For the remainder of his years in school, Jones was almost always older than 
his classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 After playing running back and linebacker at Omaha Central High, Jones 
attended Nebraska, where, in three years, he ran for 3,153 yards, second on the 
school's all-time rushing list, and scored 40 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 But he still kept thinking about that age thing. He was 23 after last season 
and decided that, for all of his running success, he was also running out of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at it from the standpoint of a running back," Jones said, "I 
think the longevity is three or four years. And I wasn't getting any younger." 
</P>
<P>
 But he did get richer. He gave up his senior year of eligibility and became a 
third-round pick of the Raiders, receiving $305,000 for this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones didn't arrive in camp with any illusions. He knew he was only a 
third-round pick. He knew the Raiders already had a starting tailback in Ty 
Montgomery. And Jones knew former Kansas City Chief running back Harvey 
Williams had been signed the day before the draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was going to be my learning year," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 He learned his biggest lesson when the Raiders went to Miami last month to 
play the Dolphins. It wasn't anything that happened at Joe Robbie Stadium. It 
happened at lunch the day before. Jones ate with Cris Carter, the wide receiver 
of the Minnesota Vikings, who was enjoying a bye week. They met through the 
agent they employ. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter told Jones rookies too often made the mistake of being the last to 
arrive at meetings and first to leave after practice. "The people you see who 
come in early and who stay after practice are the veteran guys," he said. "It's 
just like a job. You have to put in overtime and, the more you know about the 
job, the better off you're going to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones took the advice seriously. He arrives at the Raiders' training 
headquarters in El Segundo at 7:15 a.m., about an hour early. He spends the 
lunch break in the weight room, then stays after practice to work on his 
pass-catching, a skill he didn't have much of an opportunity to develop at 
Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first half of the season, the only activity Jones got was in practice. 
He was, as expected, third in the pecking order at tailback behind Williams and 
Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, Carter's words came back to Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, who struggled on occasion for playing time in Philadelphia, told 
Jones, "You can't get down just because you're not playing. You still have a 
job to do, a job they pay you to do. That's all that matters." 
</P>
<P>
 Slimmed down from the 212 pounds to 203, Jones finally got a dividend from all 
the time and effort he has invested last week against the Rams when he got his 
first carries of the season. He responded with 32 yards in six carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt good just to do a little pounding, banging around on my shoulder to 
really see how it is (in the NFL)," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was fine, according to Jack Reilly, the offensive back coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a good style for the pros," Reilly said. "He's a good runner who 
accelerates at the line. I think he's just going to get better. It's exciting."

 With so many injuries occurring at quarterback, the Rams decided to re-sign 
Jamie Martin and put running back James Bostic on injured reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Bostic, the Rams' third-round draft pick, has been listed as inactive for the 
team's first 10 games, but instead being cut he remained on injured reserve.

 The Raiders had a big day on the field Wednesday. They didn't win a game or 
even score a point. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Jeff Hostetler participated in his first full practice since 
jamming three toes on his left foot in last Sunday's game against the Rams. He 
was able to throw successfully. 
</P>
<P>
 Offensive tackle Gerald Perry returned to practice for the first time since 
breaking his right ankle a month ago and was able to go through the drills with 
only "a little pain." 
</P>
<P>
 And safety Derrick Hoskins, who sat out last week's game against the Rams 
because of a sprained ankle, returned to practice and said he was ready for 
Sunday's game at the Coliseum against the New Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
 The only bad news was the absence of cornerback Lionel Washington, who sat out 
Wednesday's practice because of an injury to the lower left leg. Washington, 
who was injured last Sunday, is scheduled for X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders are already missing starting cornerback Albert Lewis, who will be 
sidelined for the second game in a row this Sunday because of a sprained right 
knee. . . . The Raiders added cornerback John Reece to their practice squad. 
Reece, from Nebraska, was taken in the fourth round of the 1994 draft by the 
Arizona Cardinals. STEVE SPRINGER

REMY'S LATE-BLOOMING RUNNING CAREER IS FLOURISHING AT ORANGE COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Erin Remy went out for cross-country at Orange Coast in the summer of 
1993, she had no idea what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
 Remy, 28, had been running less than three years, and had never been part of a 
team or in a competitive race. 
</P>
<P>
 But with one race left in her community college career, Remy has overcome her 
inexperience and worked around the birth of her daughter to become one of 
Southern California's best.  
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think (my life) would be like this," Remy said. "I never intended 
for it to happen. It just sort of fell that way and I wouldn't trade it for the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 Remy and her Orange Coast teammates will take part in the State meet Saturday 
at Fresno's Woodward Park. The Irvine Valley women's team and the Fullerton 
men's team also qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago in the State meet, Remy had morning sickness. This year she is just 
plain sick and bothered that she won't be healthy on race day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the flu all weekend," she said. "Plus, I've been stressing about the 
race." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter where Remy finishes Saturday, her season has been impressive, 
especially considering how little time she has been running competitively. 
</P>
<P>
 Remy graduated from South Pasadena High in 1984. Although athletic, she didn't 
participate in school-sanctioned sports. Instead, she spent a great deal of 
time working on her horse riding and jumping skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon graduation from high school, Remy said she had no specific idea of what 
she wanted in life. She didn't enroll in college (OCC) until the fall of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took a six- or seven-year break," she said. "Then I was ready to go back to 
school. I guess you could say I grew up." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before attending OCC, she had started walking. Her strolls became 
longer before she slowly started to run. Pretty soon, she discovered she had a 
knack for it and decided to give cross-country a try. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had never been a part of a team before, but I liked to run so I wanted to 
try it and see how I'd do," Remy said. "I really like the competitive part of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Remy became pregnant early last season, and her times slowed toward the end of 
the season. Still, she kept running, completing a half-marathon five months 
into her pregnancy. She was still running two weeks before her daughter, Eden 
Remy Nordelo, was born June 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Her doctor advised her to take six weeks off after giving birth. But Remy 
couldn't wait, and after two weeks she tried to jog. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like I had never run before that first day," she said. "I started out 
thinking I would do five miles but had to stop after only two. But it really 
came back pretty fast. I was surprised." 
</P>
<P>
 Remy had about three months to get ready for this season but wasn't sure if 
she would be in competitive shape. Besides running, she also must care for her 
daughter and go to class. Remy gets plenty of help from her parents. 
</P>
<P>
 From the start of the season in mid-September, Remy, along with Fullerton's 
Teresa Vega, Golden West's Kim Foster and Irvine Valley's Mayra Medina have 
been the top female runners in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Remy, who has learned to control her pace much better this season, took a step 
in front of the others two weeks ago at the Orange Empire Conference finals. 
She finished second on the 5,000-meter course at Costa Mesa Fairview Regional 
Park. Her time of 19 minutes 12 seconds was 41 seconds better than a time she 
had on the same course three months before. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside's Charlotte Mayock won the race in 18:51. Mayock is also the 
favorite at the State race. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most impressive thing about that race was that Mayock didn't gain 
anything on Erin after the first half-mile," OCC Coach Gordie Fitzel said. "Not 
too many runners have been able to do that this season. Erin just went out too 
slow but that is one of the things she is learning. She is running with much 
more confidence this season." 
</P>
<P>
 Remy's strong performance has produced a scholarship to Cal State Fullerton 
next fall. She plans to major in human services. But before that she must 
finish her class work at OCC this spring, which will give her a chance to be 
part of the Pirates' track team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea (what events I will run in)," Remy said. "I've never been on a 
track team before."

ANGELS PUT RELIEVER SMITH ON WINTER SHOPPING LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels, regretting their decision not to act a year ago, have decided to 
pursue free-agent relief pitcher Lee Smith, according to club officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, baseball's all-time saves leader, finished the season with a 
major-leading 33 for the Baltimore Orioles. Smith produced 12 more saves than 
the entire Angel bullpen, which ranked last in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's our biggest need," Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann said. "If 
you've got a closer down there, it can make all the difference in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Also Wednesday, the Angels continued trade discussions with the San Diego 
Padres involving center fielder Chad Curtis. The Angels are seeking a package 
that would include right-handed starter Scott Sanders ($115,000) or 
right-hander Andy Ashby ($225,000). 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels would be willing to trade Curtis for reliever Trevor Hoffman, but 
the Padres rejected the advance. Hoffman, who saved 20 games last season, is in 
the midst of a three-year contract that will pay him $315,000 in 1995 and 
$955,000 in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's possible we could have a match somewhere down the line," Padre General 
Manager Randy Smith said, "but we don't know right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi, after talking with every club during the 
general manager meetings, said the Angels have narrowed their focus to one or 
two clubs, but doubted that a trade could be made today. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's possible something could be done today, but it's unlikely," said Bavasi, 
who's returning to California this afternoon. "It's just difficult in this 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
 While the Angels have discovered this week that it's too prohibitive to 
acquire closer John Wetteland of Montreal or Kansas City closer Jeff 
Montgomery, Smith might fit in their budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who turns 37 in December, earned $1.5 million last season and became a 
free agent when the Orioles refused to offer salary arbitration. He's expected 
to earn at least $2 million on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels could clear space for Smith under their $24.5-million budget by not 
tendering a contract to reliever Joe Grahe. Grahe earned $910,000 last season 
and would be eligible for arbitration if it still exists under the new labor 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels nearly acquired Smith during the 1993 season when he pitched for 
the St. Louis Cardinals. The Angels were offering starter Chuck Finley to St. 
Louis for third baseman Todd Zeile, pitcher Joe Magrane and Smith. The 
Cardinals backed out of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels also explored the possibility of acquiring Smith last winter. Yet, 
Whitey Herzog, general manager at the time, received unfavorable reports and 
did not submit a free-agent offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith went to Baltimore, and proved again that he's one of the premier 
relievers in the game. He saved a major league-record 12 games in April, and 
was successful in 33 of 39 opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting a lot of interest in Lee," said Jim Bronner, Smith's agent, 
"but at this point, it's hard to read the Angels' interest. I think once one or 
two teams make offers, the other clubs will either show interest or drop by the 
wayside." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels' ability to acquire Smith, who is being strongly pursued by the 
Orioles and Texas Rangers, also could hinge on the Angels' new stadium 
proposal. If the city of Anaheim approves a new stadium for the 1998 season, 
Angel President Richard Brown said the club might increase their 1995 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "Irrespective, this ballclub will be improved," Brown said, "but a new stadium 
perhaps would make it happen faster. If we get approval for a new stadium, we 
know we'll be afforded more resources to be competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Janicki, the Angels' 1992 first-round draft pick, has been outrighted off 
the 40-man roster. The move enables the Angels to avoid Janicki's $235,000 
option for 1995. Janicki cleared waivers, however, and will return to the 
organization in 1995 under a reconstructed contract. . . . Several clubs have 
inquired about the availability of Chuck Finley, but the Angels say that unless 
they're overwhelmed by an offer, he's staying put. . . . Rex Hudler, who filed 
for free agency after playing for the Angels last season, has drawn attracted 
interest from several clubs, including the Dodgers.

PREP NOTES: ADAMS TO SKIP BASKETBALL AT CYPRESS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Julie Adams, the only returning starter from Cypress' 26-4 girls' basketball 
team, decided Wednesday to leave the program to concentrate on softball. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams' decision came after she received confirmation that she is one of 39 
national finalists for the U.S. Junior World team that will conduct tryouts 
Jan. 3-8 at Cal State Fullerton.There, the group will be pared to 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been hurt in basketball before, and if I get hurt at all, there's no 
chance for me," said Adams, a shortstop who will attend UCLA on a softball 
scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ultimate goal is to be in the Olympics, and this is one step closer. I 
would never forgive myself if, a week before the tryouts, I broke my ankle in a 
basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and I want to give it my 
best shot and be as ready as I can be." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams averaged 17.3 points, 13.5 rebounds and shot 56% from the field last 
year. MARTIN HENDERSON

LOARA REPLACES EL DORADO IN PLAYOFFS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Southern Section Division V football playoff field was altered Wednesday 
when El Dorado was dropped because the Golden Hawks used an ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
 Loara will replace El Dorado as the Empire League's No. 2 team in the playoffs 
and play host to Canyon.The Southern Section has moved the game from Friday to 
Saturday to give the teams a fair chance to prepare. The site will be announced 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like you've been sitting in the electric chair, and somebody brings you 
back to life," Loara Coach John deFries said. "I first thought it was a joke. 
When I went to the principal's office at 3 p.m. and was told I had to attend an 
emergency league meeting I thought they were pulling my leg." 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado Principal Joe Quartucci informed the Southern Section office 
Wednesday that the Golden Hawks (6-4, 4-1 in league) would forfeit all their 
victories for using a player in his ninth semester, which is not allowed under 
section rules. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be the second meeting between Loara and Canyon, which beat the 
Saxons, 15-13, in the third week of the season. MIKE TERRY

 Bruin officials said Wednesday that several thousand tickets remain for 
Saturday's USC-UCLA game at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1980, four games in the series have failed to sell out: 1983 (83,763, at 
the Coliseum), 1984 (90,096, Rose Bowl), 1991 (84,623, Coliseum) and 1992 
(80,568, Rose Bowl). 
</P>
<P>
 Record crowd: 103,303 in 1939. Result: A scoreless tie.

 Last six-digit crowd: 100,741 in 1988, at the Rose Bowl.

 John Robinson, on Rob Johnson's recurring ankle injury: 
</P>
<P>
 "What we do now is, we drag him off the field and slap some more tape on the 
ankle. Then he comes over to me and says: 'OK, I'm ready to go back in.' He's 
afraid of (Brad) Otton getting too much playing time. When you're a starting 
quarterback anywhere for a period of years, you're subject to a lot of 
scrutiny, and there are always critics. But that game Rob played against 
Arizona was as good a game as any quarterback ever had for me." . . . In the 
seesaw battle for the conference punting lead, UCLA's Darren Schager is leading 
USC's John Stonehouse, 43.9 yards per punt to 43.7. . . . Robinson, on the UCLA 
game: "It's an even game. I don't think there's a favorite. Right now, UCLA is 
as good as anyone in the Pac-10, including us." EARL GUSTKEY

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; UCLA; BRUIN'S BET MIGHT BRING ON A SONG 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Andersen will have his mind on the USC-UCLA game Saturday, but he will 
be listening to the scores on the public address system at the Rose Bowl. Of 
particular interest: Alabama vs. Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen called KLOS radio Tuesday and bet Mark Thompson of the "Mark and 
Brian Show" that Alabama, with former UCLA assistant Homer Smith as its 
offensive coordinator, would beat Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes: If Alabama wins, Thompson will sing the Crimson Tide's fight song 
to Andersen. If Auburn wins, Andersen, UCLA's long snapper, has to sing USC's 
fight song. Actually, the bet was $20, made over the air, but then Andersen got 
a call from the station. "Somebody told them it was against NCAA rules for me 
to bet on a college game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Thompson might have to look up Alabama's fight song, Andersen will have 
no trouble remembering USC's "Fight On." His father, Foster, played and coached 
at UCLA and was a USC assistant for 14 years, under John McKay and John 
Robinson.

WARRIORS SIGN WEBBER; TRADE POSSIBILITY LOOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Webber re-signed Wednesday night with the Golden State Warriors after a 
bitter contract dispute, but that did little to quell speculation he might not 
remain with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors, who did not release terms of the agreement, said Webber was 
expected to rejoin the team Friday or Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The signing came at the end of a holdout that led Coach Don Nelson to say he 
would quit if such a move would facilitate signing Webber, who has said he was 
unhappy playing for Nelson last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Webber was angered at Nelson for making such a suggestion, and meanwhile his 
agents said they were investigating possible trades with four teams, including 
the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 By signing Webber, the Warriors now would be able to trade him. They could not 
have traded Webber, or even negotiated with other teams about a trade, while he 
remained an unsigned restricted free agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We continue with the speculation," agent Bill Strickland said in response to 
a question about whether Webber would soon be traded. "He's under contract with 
the Warriors, and that's all I can say at this time. He's happy to have signed 
his contract, and hopefully we can move beyond what has been a press spectacle 
out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Webber has missed the team's first six games.

SOCCER LEAGUE CONFIRMS: NO KICKOFF UNTIL '96 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alan Rothenberg, who put together the 1994 World Cup tournament that was the 
most profitable in soccer history, confirmed Wednesday that Major League Soccer 
will not get under way in the United States until April 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay is the second for the fledgling outdoor professional league whose 
development was mandated by FIFA, the sport's world governing body, when it 
granted the '94 World Cup to the United States.Original plans called for MLS to 
start in 1995, although FIFA originally wanted a league in place before the 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the beginning we have all said it is far more important that we launch 
Major League Soccer right than we do it on any particular preordained 
timetable," Rothenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tampa and Chicago were added to the list of Boston; Columbus, Ohio; Los 
Angeles, New Jersey (Giants Stadium), San Jose and Washington, which were 
announced in June. 
</P>
<P>
 A ninth team, Long Island (N.Y.), announced in the summer, will not begin play 
until 1997 at the earliest because of stadium problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors for the Los Angeles, New Jersey and Washington teams, as well as a 
fourth investor for a yet-undetermined franchise, also were introduced. 
</P>
<P>
 Top candidates for the remaining two franchises are Dallas, Denver, Detroit, 
Indianapolis, Kansas City, Miami, San Diego, Seattle and Tulsa.

BYU-UTAH WINNER LIKELY TO GET FREEDOM BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don Andersen, executive director of the Freedom Bowl, will attend the Brigham 
Young-Utah football game Saturday in Salt Lake City, and probably will announce 
on Sunday that the winner will represent the Western Athletic Conference in the 
Dec. 27 game at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-place team in the WAC and the third-place team from the Pacific 10 
Conference will be invited to play in the 11th annual game. 
</P>
<P>
 The most likely scenario would match BYU, 10-2 if it defeats Utah, against 
Arizona, 8-3, if it defeats Arizona State on Nov. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could end up with a darned attractive game, as attractive as we've ever 
had," Andersen said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a Utah victory, a loss by Colorado State to Fresno State (4-6-1) on 
Saturday, coupled with a victory by Air Force over Hawaii Dec. 3, could force a 
four-way tie and delay the selection process. 
</P>
<P>
 The Freedom Bowl's selection committee is scheduled to meet Sunday morning, 
and the invitation to the WAC team is expected to be made later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen said he must wait until after the bowl coalition picks a 
representative from the Pac-10 before extending his invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 If first-place Oregon beats Oregon State on Saturday, the Ducks will play in 
the Rose Bowl for the first time since 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 If second-place USC defeats UCLA on Saturday and Notre Dame on Nov. 26, the 
Trojans could be headed to either the Fiesta Bowl or the Sugar Bowl. There is 
no chance USC will play in the Freedom Bowl because of a new contract 
stipulation between the game and the Pac-10, Andersen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans have played in the past two Freedom Bowls, losing to Fresno State 
in 1992 and defeating Utah last year. 
</P>
<P>
 If third-place Arizona defeats Arizona State and USC wins Saturday, the 
Wildcats will play in the Freedom Bowl. A Wildcat loss and a Washington State 
victory over Washington could bring Washington State to the Freedom Bowl.

ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT; KENNEDY'S GIBSON USED FOOTBALL AS VEHICLE FOR REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trace Gibson scornfully watched the Kennedy High football players practicing 
in 90-degree heat and shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Look at those fools, he thought early last fall while relaxing on the school 
bus. You wouldn't catch me doing all that hard work.  
</P>
<P>
 Why work when you can play? Basketball was Gibson's sport. 
</P>
<P>
 And at 6 feet 4, 230 pounds -- the biggest player on the Golden Cougar 
basketball team -- he could coast. No serious effort required. It was fun, a 
diversion. 
</P>
<P>
 So was cutting class and blowing off homework to hang out with friends who 
shared his attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, life was good. Easy. It got harder when teachers questioned his behavior 
or asked about a missing assignment. He lashed out.  
</P>
<P>
 He got in their face, under their skin. Who could embarrass the other more?  
</P>
<P>
 Who was more intimidating? Once he snapped, threw a chair across a classroom 
and was suspended for two days. 
</P>
<P>
 This tendency toward laziness caused his grades to dip so low during his 
junior year that he was declared academically ineligible for the basketball 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 That was a shock. His failure was public, an embarrassment. Gradually, Gibson 
took stock of himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a reputation of being a loudmouth," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I had a pretty bad temper when it came to authority. I had no self-control. 
The teachers thought I was just another stupid inner-city kid." 
</P>
<P>
 There is hardly a Trace of the old Gibson now.  
</P>
<P>
 After overcoming a slight heart ailment, he is now a starter on the Kennedy 
offensive line and catching the attention of college recruiters.  
</P>
<P>
 He speaks matter-of-factly, in a polite, self-confident manner, insisting the 
bad days are over. 
</P>
<P>
 He seems so sure of his identity, so perceptive and intelligent, that it's 
difficult to imagine him as a troublemaker with a 1.9 grade-point average.  
</P>
<P>
 But that's what he was -- if not quite going Nowhere, in the exit lane with 
his turn-signal flashing. 
</P>
<P>
 But then he veered. To Somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 After two years of ignoring Coach Bob Francola's pleas to don shoulder pads, 
Gibson reconsidered and enrolled in a football class last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The results? His grades have improved, his behavior has made a 180-degree turn 
and -- lo and behold -- he even likes to sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was an underachiever, and other things were taking priority over the 
classroom," Francola said. "He's never worked so hard. I think he's having the 
time of his life." 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson didn't know school -- and hard work -- could be so much fun. He grew up 
in South Central Los Angeles and attended an Inglewood private school in 
seventh and eighth grade. That was the last time he played football. He wore 
flags, not pads, and played running back. "I was a speedster back then," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother moved to the San Fernando Valley and he enrolled at Kennedy, where 
his father worked as a facilities manager. After a rough start, the new setting 
produced a new Gibson. He went from self-indulgent to self-restrained. 
</P>
<P>
 "Football has taught me many things," he said. "I accept criticism better and 
I don't lash out at people. Now I always think twice of what I'm going to say 
because of football. It's turned me around quite a bit." 
</P>
<P>
 His grade-point average hovers around 2.6, he attends all of his classes and 
the only time he appears in the office of Tim Guy, a school dean, is to say 
hello. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm ecstatic," Guy said. "I wouldn't be stretching it too far to say he's 
becoming a role model." 
</P>
<P>
 But not without difficulty. Gibson has a long-standing condition of occasional 
heart palpitations. One day last spring during a weight-training class he had a 
severe palpitation. He tried to run to the nurse's office but passed out and 
was taken to a hospital. It was a scary time, but three days of testing 
revealed nothing seriously wrong, and doctors granted him permission to play 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
 He still gets the palpitations, but usually only when he is resting at home. 
He has never had one while playing a sport and says he doesn't think much about 
them anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 A much-less-serious fear -- but a fear nonetheless -- overtook him the first 
time he participated in a contact drill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was like, 'Oh, my God,' " he said. "I was scared to death of getting hit, 
and scared to tackle." 
</P>
<P>
 Not the ideal mentality for a linebacker, where he was slotted, but of such 
humble beginnings are players made. After the team's opener against Sylmar, 
Gibson was moved to the offensive line and he found a home. "It's fun," he 
said. "I'm definitely hitting someone real hard now." 
</P>
<P>
 He started several games at left tackle and was switched recently to right 
guard. At each stop he has rapidly improved, quickly absorbing instruction and 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Flint Hardman, a senior who switched positions with Gibson, says, "He's good 
for a first-time player. To master it you have to play for a couple years at 
least, but for him to even keep up with the average has been a challenge. He's 
just a true athlete." 
</P>
<P>
 No arguments there. Gibson isn't the most-polished player on the Golden Cougar 
team, but the numbers -- 6-4, 230 -- make college recruiters snap to attention. 
Several scouts have come to Kennedy games never having heard of Gibson, but on 
seeing him make it their business to remember his name. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson says he will play basketball this season, but his college plans involve 
football. He already has received a letter from Arizona. Others will surely 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
 A recruiter at another West Coast school said recently he had not yet heard of 
Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
 "How big is he?" the recruiter asked. He listened to the numbers. "Well, I'll 
have to come see him." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Francola: "He's quite a find because he's got the athletic ability of a 
major-college athlete. When you look at the linemen who play on Sunday (in the 
NFL), those are all guys who are athletic and can play basketball, for 
instance, like Trace. He's got a major future." 
</P>
<P>
 Comments such as those make Gibson smile. No longer is he the guy on the bus, 
disdaining hard work and watching other people excel. Now he is a "role model" 
with a "major future." 
</P>
<P>
 After starting slowly, he has learned to finish his blocks, real and 
metaphorical. Football simply became the vehicle a young man used to grow up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Football has been great for me," he says. "I feel so sorry I didn't play 
earlier."

PLAYOFFS AGAIN BRING TROUBLE FOR KENNEDY; HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: PLAYER 
SUSPENSIONS, INJURIES, SQUABBLE WITH CRENSHAW OVER GAME SITE GNAW AT GOLDEN 
COUGARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Eliminate one problem and two more shall take its place. 
</P>
<P>
 So it goes with the Kennedy High football team and the postseason. The Golden 
Cougars missed the City Section 4-A Division playoffs the past two years amid 
controversial circumstances -- both involving this year's first-round opponent, 
Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 And when Kennedy meets Crenshaw in Friday's first round the Golden Cougars 
might be without the services of as many as four starters. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore receiver Aaron Lewis and senior cornerback Ladell Shuler were 
suspended from school last week for undisclosed disciplinary reasons. Their 
suspension ends today, but school administrators ruled that Lewis cannot return 
to the team this season. Shuler's status will be determined today. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis is the Golden Cougars' leading receiver with 27 catches for 359 yards 
and five touchdowns. Shuler's younger brother, Lamar, will start if Ladell 
cannot play. Laron Scarbrough will start in Lewis' place.  
</P>
<P>
 Leading rusher Antwane Smith (1,486 yards and 20 touchdowns) suffered a 
strained left knee last week against Taft and has practiced lightly. Coach Bob 
Francola said Smith's status will be determined Friday afternoon. Additionally, 
strong safety Laron Davis suffered a mild concussion against Taft and is 
questionable to play Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the schools spent half the week haggling over a site. Crenshaw's 
field has no lights and the school at first suggested playing a day game there, 
or a 5 p.m. contest at Jackie Robinson Stadium as the first game of a 
doubleheader before the Granada Hills-Dorsey game at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ridiculous," Francola said. "That wouldn't give parents a chance to get 
to the game." 
</P>
<P>
 After negotiations that Francola described as "an ongoing soap opera," 
Crenshaw reluctantly agreed Wednesday to play at Palisades High at 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Kennedy was voted into the 4-A playoffs by other City coaches 
but Francola relinquished the bid to Crenshaw. His reasoning? Fairness. 
Crenshaw earlier had beaten his team. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Kennedy beat Crenshaw, 55-12, but the Cougars earned a playoff 
berth and Kennedy did not. The Golden Cougars were shut out from the postseason 
when they lost a California tiebreaker to El Camino Real after the 
regular-season finale. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody stood up and said we deserved to be in (the 4-A playoffs)," Francola 
said. "This year we're in, and we're excited with who we're playing. It's 
karma, I guess."

GRIPPING SUSPENSE; ALL HANDS LOVED WRESTLEMANIA TOO IN PALMDALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Critics panned the film, but few questioned the depiction of championship arm 
wrestlers as roaring, wild-eyed maniacs in "Over the Top." The contestants 
drank motor oil and slapped each other silly to get psyched up for matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody could beat Sylvester Stallone, who grabbed the world championship 
before a screaming throng of thousands, raking in $350,000 in cash and prizes 
plus custody of his 12-year-old son along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 That was Hollywood. This is Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 The showroom of Palmdale Honda to be exact, site of the California Arm 
Wrestling Championships, fully sanctioned and all that. 
</P>
<P>
 What sort of muscle tussle went down Sunday behind those windows splashed with 
"0 Down Available!" and "Poor Credit: No Problem!"? 
</P>
<P>
 Expectation: Brainless, beery-breathed hulks and enough hype to make even the 
car salesmen in plaid sport coats blush. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality: A tight-knit group of everyday folks competing intensely yet 
exhibiting uncommon sportsmanship in a family environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Seriously. THE SETTING 
</P>
<P>
 Promoter-announcer Ed Levitt played a referee in "Over the Top," and 
high-energy music cranking over loudspeakers gave the impression of a sound 
track, but similarities to the movie pretty much ended there. 
</P>
<P>
 This match was an open pro-am, meaning that anyone could enter and no one 
would leave with anything more than a large trophy for his or her efforts. A 
sanctioned National Arm Wrestling Assn. tournament sounds highfalutin; this is 
basically a family-run operation perpetuated for the love of this obscure and 
somewhat-misunderstood sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Levitt, who runs the NAWA along with several people named Siegfried, kept the 
action fast-paced and filled time between matches with lively banter over the 
microphone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's gonna be the hero, who's gonna be the zero?" he shouted more than once. 
</P>
<P>
 A single table stood on a platform in the middle of the showroom surrounded by 
about 100 chairs for spectators. The place was standing-room only, with most 
fans either family or friends of contestants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pick a winner and root 'em on," Levitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-year-old daughter of heavyweight Ed Hoffman quietly did homework until 
her father competed, beaming with pride when he won a match. The teen-age 
daughter of another arm wrestler watched over a half-dozen toddlers of other 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Men competed in four weight classes: under 155 pounds, 156-181, 182-205, and 
over 205. Only two women competed: Judy Wheeler defeated Kori Siegfried twice 
in the double-elimination format. 
</P>
<P>
 Arm wrestlers, who call themselves "pullers," gripped pegs with their left 
hands and stood with their shoulders square to the table before locking right 
hands with their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Referees Dick Ingwaldson and Alen Frederick, both world champion pullers in 
their own right, held the clasped hands of the contestants until Ingwaldson 
said, "Ready, go." 
</P>
<P>
 If pullers' hands slipped apart, Ingwaldson bound them with a leather strap. 
</P>
<P>
 Matches lasted from four seconds -- a quick pin is called "flashing" an 
opponent -- to three minutes, with the longer matches seeming to last an 
eternity. 
</P>
<P>
 The vanquished unfailingly shook hands with the victors, and throughout the 
day pullers pulled for fellow pullers. THE CONTESTANTS 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the world's best arm wrestlers are from this area," Levitt proclaimed 
into the microphone. 
</P>
<P>
 Absent were local luminaries Dot Jones, a 233-pound women's heavyweight from 
North Hollywood; Lori Cole, a middleweight from Encino, and Jimbo Edwards, a 
men's heavyweight from Simi Valley, former national champions all. Terry 
Shapiro, a men's light-heavyweight champion from Simi Valley, attended but did 
not compete because of an arm injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Others did, including Craig Green, a 35-year-old former state middleweight 
champion from Arleta. He is making a comeback after suffering strained tendons 
in his forearm a year ago, the most common arm-wrestling injury. Green's 
training includes water skiing, which he says requires the same muscles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Body builders who can bench-press 500 pounds wonder how I beat them, but they 
don't realize the arm is a chain and a chain is only as strong as its weakest 
link," said Green, who at 170 pounds is not physically imposing. 
</P>
<P>
 After the blonde, blue-eyed Green easily won an early round match, Levitt 
shouted, "Who is that surfer dude?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen-year veteran Larry Marks of Palmdale was up next, and his 7-year-old 
son, Brian, accompanied him to the table, craning his neck to get a good view 
of Dad's match. 
</P>
<P>
 Marks provided the closest resemblance to Lincoln Hawk, Stallone's character 
in "Over the Top." In addition to the father-competing-to-son's-cheers 
similarity, Marks turned his cap backward before competing, a Stallone 
trademark that he described in the movie as "turning on a switch" of intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, after two early victories, Marks lost two in a row and was eliminated. 
Brian gave his dad a hug and put on the oversized NAWA T-shirt Larry received 
as a consolation prize. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Gilio, a salesman at Palmdale Honda who persuaded his employer to stage 
the tournament, was up next. He once finished second in the world amateur 
championships, but on this day was no match for Rick the Pony-Tailed Sheet 
Metal Worker from Temecula. 
</P>
<P>
 Several pullers had nicknames, including the top heavyweights: Mishon 
(Bruiser) Neal and Eric (The French Connection) Woelfel. Neal wore a black 
leather jacket with "Bruiser" embroidered on the pocket and spent time between 
matches practicing pulls and listening to headphones. 
</P>
<P>
 Woelfel, the most physically imposing puller at 6 feet 5, 240 pounds of 
bulging muscle, flew in from the arm wrestling hotbed -- really -- of Petaluma, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 An underdog climbed through the 155-and-under bracket. Favorite Steve (The 
Funny Guy) Martin wasn't laughing after falling to Jerry Page, a flight-test 
mechanic from Lancaster competing in his first tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Page was nearly pinned but he came back, slowly raising his arm until finally 
getting over the top and bringing Martin's arm to the orange touch pad that 
ends the match. 
</P>
<P>
 After using the same script to defeat Rob Martin in a semifinal, Page thrust 
his arms overhead, looked toward the gathering of family and friends cheering 
him and let out a loud whoop: He had advanced to the final, where 5-foot-2 
veteran Don Siegfried, ranked No. 2 in the world, waited in ridiculous-looking 
eight-inch platform shoes that short pullers wear in order to stand eye-to-eye 
with opponents. THE SIEGFRIEDS 
</P>
<P>
 Siegfrieds stand tall in the world of arm wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Siegfried began the NAWA. Jennie Siegfried keeps the NAWA alive. Don 
Siegfried dominates the NAWA. 
</P>
<P>
 The late Larry Siegfried launched the organization in 1977, staging 
tournaments throughout Southern California and offering a respected alternative 
to existing tournaments in Petaluma, Reno and Las Vegas. The organization 
quickly gained stature and expanded, holding tournaments in Oregon, Washington, 
Texas, Nevada and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "Larry took the sport to another level," said Levitt, who trained under 
Siegfried and won a 1978 world amateur championship. "He kept it out of the 
bars and helped make it a legitimate sport with a decent following." 
</P>
<P>
 Siegfried died in 1990 of kidney cancer at age 52 and the NAWA was dormant for 
two years. In 1992, his wife Jennie revived the organization with Levitt's 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry and Jennie's children, Don and Kori, compete, and the diminutive Don 
stands head and shoulders above his lightweight competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The Larry Siegfried Memorial Award, given each year to the person Jennie feels 
best represents the sport, has become one of arm wrestling's most coveted 
honors. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the finals, Levitt presented this year's award to Ingwaldson, the 
referee and former champion who is at once the sport's clown prince and 
goodwill ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingwaldson spent the day refereeing with one eye on his two young children. 
Between matches he would dash over and wipe their noses or let them climb on 
his back. Upon receiving the award, he needed a tissue himself to wipe tears 
from his eyes. ABOUT THESE CHAMPIONSHIPS 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every arm wrestler, it seems, has a grip on some sort of championship. 
The sport has more organizational arms than an octopus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most tournaments bill themselves as state or national or regional 
championships," said Lori Cole, the 10-time world champion from Encino who 
didn't compete in Palmdale. "Ed and Jennie have theirs. I have my own. There 
are hundreds of us. In that way, our sport is fragmented." 
</P>
<P>
 Levitt says an NAWA championship is among the most prestigious. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many organizations out there, but only a couple mean something," 
he said. "The NAWA, the Petaluma Wrist Wrestling tournament and the Yukon Jack 
events. Those are the best." THE FINALS 
</P>
<P>
 The first three finals were over in a flash, flash, flash as Siegfried 
(lightweight), Green (middleweight) and Don McClary (light heavyweight) pinned 
their opponents in fewer than 10 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The heavyweight match between Woelfel and Neal held more drama. Neal seemed 
poised to win, but Woelfel gained leverage by bracing his leg against the 
table. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly, Woelfel raised his arm until it was once again perpendicular to the 
table. The music was blaring, the crowd was on its feet, jumping, clapping, 
shouting. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Arm wrestling is the ultimate in one-on-one competition," Levitt would say 
afterward. "No devices. It's you against me." 
</P>
<P>
 Woelfel adjusted his grip, wrapping his fingers as high over Neal's hand as 
possible, and started . . . OVER . . . THE . . . TOP. When his arm hit the 
orange pad, Neal reacted as if he had touched a flame. " Arrrrgggg. " 
</P>
<P>
 Ingwaldson slammed his hand on the table and yelled, "Pin!" 
</P>
<P>
 Woelfel leaped up and broke into a huge grin, revealing a full set of braces 
that instantly gave him the look of an adolescent. 
</P>
<P>
 Levitt and Jennie Siegfried handed out trophies and another NAWA mix of sport 
and spectacle was done, a hands-down success.

ANGEL WILL BECOME A SUN DEVIL; GOLF: GRANADA HILLS HIGH SENIOR, WHO ALSO 
CONSIDERED USC, SIGNS LETTER OF INTENT WITH ARIZONA STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 For golfer Darren Angel, being a two-time junior All-American meant the 
college recruiting activity was hot and heavy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, it was fun. Sure, the attention was flattering. Initially, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was great for about the first week or two," Angel said. "Then it became a 
pain in the butt." 
</P>
<P>
 Angel ended a week of speculation Wednesday when he announced he had signed a 
letter of intent with Arizona State, a perennial NCAA power. He also was 
considering Nevada Las Vegas and USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel, a senior at Granada Hills High, has compiled a heady list of 
credentials and is considered among the best the region has produced. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel, 17, who already has won a pair of City Section individual 
championships, advanced to the quarterfinals of the U.S. Junior Amateur last 
summer and again has been named an All-American by the American Junior Golf 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, Angel (6 feet, 200 pounds) shot a course-record 63 during a match 
at Knollwood Golf Course in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year I'll be looking for the 50s," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State is coached by Randy Lein, formerly the coach at USC. Angel said 
he has known Lein for three years and that the two have comparable 
temperaments. That is, Lein's manner also is understated. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's kick-back," Angel said. "I thought the school was the best fit for me. 
It's a top-10 school and I can play the best competition my first year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just felt most comfortable there." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State has produced several PGA Tour standouts, most notably Phil 
Mickelson and Tom Purtzer. Mickelson's younger brother, Tim, also committed to 
Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel, who maintained he was mostly undecided, waited until the final moments 
of the NCAA's early signing period -- which ended Wednesday -- to make his 
decision. He is relieved that the recruiting process had ceased. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was stressful," he said. "There was lots to think about every day. Lots of 
letters, lots of phone calls." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision put to rest a report published last week that Angel had committed 
to play at USC.

KEEPING TRACK / JASON REID: COLUMBIA A NO-BRAINER FOR PETRONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Challenges can make people do the darndest things, especially when they're the 
cerebral type like Dan Petrone. The two biggest challenges Petrone has had to 
face simultaneously drew him to the best and worst of college life. 
</P>
<P>
 Petrone, a thinking man's middle linebacker, departed from the county for New 
York in the summer of 1993 after outstanding athletic and academic careers at 
Estancia High and Orange Coast College. He traveled about 2,800 miles to play 
and learn at Columbia, an Ivy League school renowned for its award-winning 
scholars and repugnant football. 
</P>
<P>
 If things could've worked out better, Petrone would like someone to explain 
how. 
</P>
<P>
 "The challenge of turning around the program, and the challenge of taking on 
one of the toughest schools in the nation, is something I really wanted," 
Petrone said. "After I graduate, I'll be able to look back on my two years at 
Columbia and see that, both from an academic and athletic standpoint, I met the 
challenges I knew I was facing." 
</P>
<P>
 Petrone, 22, is a two-year starter in the middle of the Lions' four-three 
defense. He's second on the team in tackles with 76 and is tied for third in 
tackles for losses (eight). 
</P>
<P>
 His consistent effort is a big reason the Lions will finish with a winning 
season for the first time in more than two decades. With one game left, 
Columbia is 5-3-1. The Lions, who play host to Brown on Saturday, were 6-3 in 
1971. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's made a ton of plays," Columbia Coach Ray Tellier said. "He's been very, 
very consistent and very steady. 
</P>
<P>
 "We rely on him to make a lot of tackles and he has come up big." 
</P>
<P>
 A J.C. Grid-Wire scholar-athlete while at Orange Coast, Petrone also meets his 
goals in the classroom, maintaining a 3.6 grade-point average. He will graduate 
in May with a degree in psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 "With our academic standards, we don't get many (community college transfer 
students) in this league," Tellier said. "But we felt we had a need two years 
ago and we felt he could fill it. We haven't been disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 Petrone did not receive scholarship offers after high school because football 
powers want their linebackers a little bigger than 5 feet 10 and 200 pounds. He 
figured enrolling at Orange Coast would give him some time to think about his 
course on the football field and in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 After his sophomore season, Petrone drew interest from a few schools. When 
Columbia called, however, the choice was simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought about the weight of the degree," he said, "and I don't regret the 
decision at all." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 It didn't take long for freshman forward Jed Weinstein to display his flair 
for success at Emory University. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein, who excelled in soccer and tennis at Corona del Mar, is sixth on 
the soccer team in scoring for Emory, a Division III school in Atlanta. He has 
three goals and six points in 10 games for the Eagles (7-10-1), and scored the 
first goal in the team's 2-0 victory over Chicago on Oct. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jed has definitely come in and done what we expected him to do," Coach Mike 
Rubesch said. "He's a tremendous team player."  
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein also plans to continue his tennis career at Emory. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Brian and Grant Pearsall, formerly of Villa Park High, are preparing for 
relatively important football games Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian, a standout junior defensive end at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, which 
hopes to finish undefeated in conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs (6-4, 2-0 in the American West Conference) visit Southern Utah to 
close the season. Brian (6-2, 265) leads the conference in sacks with 10 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant (6-1, 185) is a freshman free safety at USC who contributes on special 
teams. USC plays some school that's based in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Kuebler made good things happen for Los Alamitos, and she's doing the 
same for the USC women's volleyball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuebler, a junior outside hitter, has 272 kills -- third-most on the team. 
Kuebler (6-0) has helped the Trojans to an 18-6 record and a No. 12 national 
ranking by Volleyball Monthly magazine.

LOS ALAMITOS; KORINER'S STOCK MOVES UP FAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STACY PIGOTT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trainer Brian Koriner, already one of the most successful young trainers at 
Los Alamitos, added to his reputation by winning two stakes races last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Koriner, 28, won the $50,000 AQHA Challenge Distance Championship on Friday 
night with Speedy Lunch, for the second consecutive year, then returned on 
Saturday and won the $63,000 PCQHRA Breeders' Derby with Daily Triple. 
</P>
<P>
 Speedy Lunch had won the inaugural running of the Challenge Distance 
Championship race last year, when it was run at Sunland Park in El Paso. And 
Daily Triple's performance in the Breeders' Derby marked the third year in a 
row that Koriner has had a horse in the top three in that race. 
</P>
<P>
 Koriner, who grew up in the Diamond Bar area, has been training racehorses for 
only about six years. He started in the racing business working on the starting 
gates at Fairplex Park in Pomona with Tucker Slender, who is now the starter at 
Santa Anita. Gradually, he moved up to trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved horses," Koriner said. "My dad always took me to the races as a kid. 
That's what I always wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Koriner has trained the 7-year-old Speedy Lunch since the gelding was 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Victor Rodas of Redondo Beach and Pat Marckesano of Rancho Palos 
Verdes, Speedy Lunch has won 11 stakes races and earned nearly $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing third in the Table Tennis Handicap, his only other California 
start this year, Speedy Lunch proved he was at his best Friday night. Under the 
guidance of jockey Guillermo Gutierrez, Speedy Lunch dueled with three-time 
distance champion Griswold before pulling ahead and winning the $50,000 race by 
1 3/4 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 "Earlier in his life, he was a nervous horse," Koriner said of Speedy Lunch. 
"As he gets older, he's maturing and getting better." 
</P>
<P>
 Daily Triple, with Ralph Seville up, broke well in the PCQHRA Breeders' Derby 
on Saturday, battling the Charles Treece-trained Barryme before winning by a 
head. The triumph was the second stakes victory of the meeting for Daily 
Triple, who also won the Governor's Cup Derby in September. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was real confident going into the finals," Koriner said. "If (Daily Triple) 
broke clean, I thought we could win the race." 
</P>
<P>
 Koriner is fourth among the leading trainers at Los Alamitos. 
</P>

<P>
 Jockey Kenny Hart, who has spent most of his career at Los Alamitos, will be 
trying for victory number 2,000 there Friday night when he rides Meter Me Gone 
in the $36,800 QHBC Far West Futurity. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart has ridden such horses as champion Florentine when she won the Grade I Go 
Man Go Handicap and champion Special Leader when he won the Champion of 
Champions. His mounts have earned more than $26 million, and he has won 3,000 
races in a career that has spanned three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Meter Me Gone, owned by the Vessels Stallion Farm, is trained by former jockey 
Danny Cardoza. Cardoza, with 2,528 victories, is the all-time leading jockey at 
Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 The two riding legends, Cardoza and Hart, teamed up in the trials of the Far 
West Futurity, taking Meter Me Gone to a 1 1/2-length victory over Duardo in 
his division. The winning time of 17.76 seconds made Meter Me Gone the fastest 
qualifier. 
</P>
<P>
 Meter Me Gone, a 2-year-old colt, has won four of eight starts this season, 
including a trial for the All-American Futurity. He finished third in the San 
Diego Handicap, second in the Malibu Handicap and won a $7,000 allowance race, 
all with Hart in the irons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Far West Futurity could provide the first stakes victory for Meter Me 
Gone, who has already earned more than $12,000.

<P>
 Missy Bug Special broke down and died during last Friday's AQHA Claiming 
Stakes Challenge Championship. Preliminary veterinary reports indicate the 
filly apparently burst a major artery to the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Jockey Richard Vaughn was not seriously injured in the spill. Kenny Hart rode 
Kczartessa to victory in the race, followed by Jolenas High and Lika Fast. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Southern California Derby winner Artesias Special Gal won the final start of 
her career in the $10,000 American Airlines Challenge last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-year-old filly is being retired with a record of nine victories in 18 
starts and $108,892 in earnings. She will be bred to leading sire First Down 
Dash.

 The scoreboard at the Breeders' Cup read: Mike Smith, $155,900; Churchill 
Downs stewards, $100. 
</P>
<P>
 After Smith collected $156,000, his 10% share of the first-place purses won by 
Cherokee Run in the Sprint and Tikkanen in the Turf Stakes, the Churchill 
stewards fined the jockey $100 for wearing a turtleneck shirt that had a brand 
name on the collar. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's Breeders' Cup outlay increased his 1994 purses to more than $15 
million, breaking the record of $14.8 million set by Jose Santos in 1988. Smith 
will be at Hollywood Park on Sunday, trying to increase the total. He has 
mounts on Lahint in the $400,000 Hollywood Derby and Forest Gazelle in the 
$150,000 Hollywood Turf Express. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith also broke his record of 62 stakes in a year when he added Nos. 63 and 
64 in the Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Lahint has won three of 10 starts this year, with the New York-based Smith 
aboard for all the victories. Lahint is winless in seven stakes starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Day, who also won two Breeders' Cup races, is second to Smith in the 
standings with $13.5 million. Day has three stakes assignments Sunday -- 
Tabasco Cat in the Hollywood Derby, Wild Gold in the Turf Express and Wharf in 
the $250,000 Citation Handicap. . . . Randy Romero, who quit riding in July to 
become a bloodstock agent and then changed his mind recently, starts working at 
Hollywood Park on Sunday. Romero, 37, has ridden horses that have earned $63 
million. . . . Alex Solis, who rode Johann Quatz to a second-place finish in 
the Breeders' Cup Mile, retains the mount for the $4-million Japan Cup in Tokyo 
on Nov. 27. . . . Memo, the 7-year-old gelding who holds the Hollywood Park 
seven-furlong record of 1:20 2/5, has been retired. . . . Hollywood Park will 
offer betting on races from Hong Kong, starting Friday night.

KEEPING TABS / DANA HADDAD: COOK WON'T LET FINAL GAME AS BRUIN PASS WITHOUT 
HEALTHY TEAM EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 As UCLA quarterback Wayne Cook prepares for Saturday's game against USC, he 
thinks not of the rival Trojans but of teammates J.J. Stokes, Kevin Jordan, 
Daron Washington, Sharmon Shah and others with whom he is playing his last game 
as a Bruin.  
</P>
<P>
 The senior from Newbury Park High, who led the Bruins to the Rose Bowl game 
last season, thinks about broken dreams, redemption and what might have been in 
a 4-6 season that has been marred by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants to beat USC. And he believes UCLA can sustain the magic it recaptured 
last week in a 59-23 victory over Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a good game -- that's all I can say," Cook said. "If we 
execute and play the way we know how, they won't stop us. We can win the 
ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the Bruins have the chance to show how good this team might have 
been had injuries not sidelined Stokes most of the season and claimed three 
offensive linemen, resulting in a 2-5 record in Pacific 10 Conference play. But 
now Cook is comfortable with the three young linemen who were forced into 
action -- Chad Sauter, Chad Overhauser and Mike Rohme -- and the offense has 
come alive with the return of Stokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that we've got those (linemen) experienced, I'm getting time to get the 
ball to J.J. and Kevin," Cook said. "It's incredible seeing those guys improve. 
We're starting to see what we would have been capable of doing if we were 
healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA set a record for total offense with 679 yards against Arizona State. Cook 
(2,283) joined Troy Aikman and Tommy Maddox as the only UCLA quarterbacks to 
pass for more than 2,000 yards in two different seasons and tied a school 
record with four touchdown passes for the third time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook's 380 yards passing (in three quarters) were the most in his career and 
fourth highest in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cook also has suffered through a six-game losing streak that ended any 
hopes for a bowl bid. Cook struggled during the skid and Coach Terry Donahue 
considered replacing him with Royal High graduate Ryan Fien. 
</P>
<P>
 Re-emerging the past two games, Cook ranks fourth at UCLA in career touchdown 
passes (32), passing yards (4,505) and completions (337). He is one of 12 
semifinalists for the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award and will play in the 
Blue-Gray game on Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
 But he would trade those accolades for a victory in Saturday's "city 
championship" game against the Trojans. USC is 7-2, 6-1 in the Pac-10 and would 
advance to the Rose Bowl game with a victory and a loss by Oregon to Oregon 
State. The Bruins, who have won the past three meetings, will be underdogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think (being the underdog) means anything," Cook said. "Last year we 
thought we were going to run away with it. And then we needed a big 
interception to save us. It's a huge game and the ball is going to take some 
funny bounces." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Barnum's circus: USC's offense is streaking and peaking and it exploded in the 
second half last week against Arizona, which had the nation's sixth-best 
defense. Junior fullback Terry Barnum (Alemany) was in the middle of the 45-28 
victory with some key blocks and receptions. 
</P>
<P>
 With a unit that ranks second in the Pac-10 in scoring at 29.4 points a game, 
the Trojans have won five in a row. They appear to be hitting on all cylinders 
after their second-biggest offensive output of the season: 550 yards. They had 
583 against Baylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnum, an undersized fullback at 5 feet 10, 200 pounds, led USC receivers 
with six receptions against Arizona. Nobody's more excited about the Trojans 
than Barnum, a one-time defensive back who cracked the starting lineup during 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't explain it," he said. "I've never felt this way on a football team. 
And I've been playing football close to 13 years now. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an energy here that keeps building. I hope it sticks around for a 
while." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnum had 72 yards in receptions against Arizona, and his presence allowed 
receivers Keyshawn Johnson (5 catches for 109 yards) and Ed Hervey (5-120) to 
work against single coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of Barnum's catches (including gains of 23 and 22 yards) brought first 
downs, and five came during touchdown drives. Most memorable was the 23-yarder 
that he hauled in while backpedaling along the Wildcat sideline. The catch gave 
USC a first down at the three-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Two plays later, the Trojans took a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But Barnum said the showdown against UCLA will be tougher than the victory 
over Arizona. USC leads the series against the Bruins, 34-22-7, but has lost 
the past three. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to throw every record out of there, any first-game injuries out of 
there," he said, referring to Stokes. "This is UCLA-SC. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter what they've done in the past. We have to be 100% ready to 
play. It's going to be a great game." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Around the country: Colorado senior Christian Fauria (Crespi) set a school 
record for most career receptions by a tight end in Saturday's 51-26 victory 
over Kansas. Fauria has 93 catches, two more than Dave Hestera, who played from 
1981-83. Fauria also caught a first-quarter scoring pass from Kordell Stewart 
to give Colorado a 14-0 lead. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Alex (Loafie) Estrada, who played eight-man football at Faith Baptist, leads 
Cal State Sacramento in punt returns (16) and return average (8.6 yards). 
Sacramento (4-5) plays host to Cal State Northridge on Saturday night. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Southern Utah punter Ron Lindberg (Canyon) has twice been named the American 
West Conference special teams player of the week this season. He ranks first in 
the conference at 41.7 yards per punt.

THE COLLEGES / STEVE ELLING: RECRUITS WONDER IF NORTHRIDGE'S DIVISION I DAYS 
ARE NUMBERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The recruiting pitch contained all the usual elements. Verbal pomp and 
circumstance, crepe and bunting, all to sell prospective athletes on the 
successes of the school's athletic program. 
</P>
<P>
 First, regale them with stories from last year's cool road trips to big-time 
sites like Hawaii. Introduce them to a semi-celebrity player. 
</P>
<P>
 Close the deal. Kid, you can have all this and more.  
</P>
<P>
 Standard pitch, straight as a fastball, but with a different tag-line. Never 
before at Cal State Northridge has a coach's exit line been a mumbled . . . "I 
think. I hope. Well, maybe."  
</P>
<P>
 At Northridge, this is what it's come to for a handful of coaches who can't 
answer the simplest of follow-up questions from recruits: What's next for the 
Matador athletic program? 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA's weeklong early signing period ended Wednesday and Northridge didn't 
exactly herniate the mailman. According to school officials, only one letter of 
intent is in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The quandary started with last month's fee referendum, which was narrowly 
defeated by student vote. It would have generated millions for athletics and 
kept the school, which moved to Division I five years ago, in a state of 
ascent. 
</P>
<P>
 At best, athletics is now in a state of flux. Budget cuts loom and several 
programs are wondering if the other shoe is going to drop. Obviously, recruits 
are concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't anybody out there right now, male or female, that would sign (in 
track) until the school makes a decision on where we're going," said Don 
Strametz, the school's longtime track coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of the referendum's defeat is manifold, with aftershocks aplenty. 
Recruiting wasn't given much thought when the campaign was mounted, but it's 
definitely being addressed after the fact. 
</P>
<P>
 In a nutshell, the athletics department gambled. In order to impress upon 
voters the possible impact of the referendum's defeat, a worst-case scenario 
was mapped out with considerable hand-wringing. 
</P>
<P>
 Defeat meant the possible loss of scholarships and programs, such as track and 
football. If enough programs were lopped, the school was facing the 
unconscionable drop to Division II. Realistic threat or not -- school officials 
say they will avoid the latter at all cost -- it was mentioned as a 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Red flags attract attention. Wouldn't you know it, recruits can read the 
papers, too. Some even heard the news through word of mouth, never known for 
its accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Strametz didn't bother sending out a single letter of intent and said things 
might be just as lean during the spring signing period, which begins in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, it's a disaster for everyone," he said. "Even programs you 
wouldn't think would be affected are being hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Bingo. The softball team, as good as any Division I program around, lost a 
"major recruit" because of the budget problems, first-year Coach Janet Sherman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were rumors in some places that us going to Division II was already a 
done deal," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the referendum failed four weeks ago, coaching track has been 
secondary to damage control for Strametz. The track network, you see, is unlike 
any other. Track folks are die-hard aficionados. There are few casual fans. 
Alas, the grapevine is abuzz with bad Northridge news. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches from throughout the state did everything but send flowers to 
Strametz's funeral and ask if he'd updated his resume. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had so many people call just to say, 'Sorry, try to make the best of 
it,' " Strametz said. "I keep telling them we're not dead yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, opposing coaches, fighting to land the same top recruits, keep 
using Northridge's predicament as leverage. With no answer regarding the 
school's direction expected until mid-December, the Matadors are losing ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Men's volleyball Coach John Price doesn't think the referendum defeat had any 
effect on his recruiting plans. Then again, he can't be sure. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, Price made a serious run at one player and didn't land him. The day 
after the referendum was voted down, the player phoned Price to ask what was 
going on. 
</P>
<P>
 "With softball and men's volleyball, you have programs that are in the top 
four or five in the country right now," Price said. "You have to take advantage 
of that while you can. It doesn't always last forever. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Uncertainty) could kill our chances of staying there." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman should be recruiting from a quantifiable position of strength. No 
Northridge program had a better season in 1993-94. The softball team was 52-10 
and reached the championship game of the Women's College World Series. Played 
on television, even. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet several recruits brought the first-year coach's recruiting pitch to a halt 
with the simple question: "Where's your program gonna be in a couple of years, 
Division II?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman, an assistant at Northridge for the past five years, lost a top 
recruit -- who signed with Cal State Fullerton -- because of the questions 
surrounding Northridge's future commitment to athletics. The coach put the best 
spin possible on the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can do at this point is assure them we plan to stay Division I and that 
I haven't been told anything differently," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some recruits are buying. Some moved on to the next sales pitch.

DISNEYLAND MARATHON FACES SEVERAL OBSTACLES; RACE: MARCH 26 DATE, HIGH ENTRY 
FEE AND NO APPEARANCE MONEY COULD CAUSE PROBLEMS. EVENT WILL BEGIN AND END 
INSIDE AMUSEMENT PARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Amid the usual Disneyland hoopla, including appearances by Mickey Mouse, Goofy 
and the rest of the gang, officials from the park Wednesday announced plans to 
stage a marathon and five-kilometer race on March 26, 1995, the day after a 
two-kilometer family fun run. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be the first county marathon since the only running of the ill-fated 
and financially troubled Orange County Marathon in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The Disneyland race will have a $19,000 purse for the marathon and $31,000 for 
the 5K. Each race will begin and end inside the park. The marathon course will 
be a double loop past Anaheim Stadium and The Pond, among other Anaheim 
landmarks. The 5K will include a loop through the park before heading to the 
streets. Both courses are described as flat and fast. 
</P>
<P>
 All prize-money winners will be featured in a parade down Main Street that 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 John Mansoor, race director for the San Francisco Marathon and the California 
International Marathon, has been enlisted to get the Disneyland Marathon up and 
running. 
</P>
<P>
 "The race is sure to be a lot of fun because Disneyland is going to do a great 
job in providing entertainment at points along the course," Mansoor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The races will be part of a celebration marking Disneyland's 40th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 If the marathon and 5K are to become typically successful and happy Disney 
events, there would appear to be a number of stumbling blocks to overcome: 
</P>
<P>
 * First is its March date, which puts it in almost direct competition with the 
Los Angeles Marathon March 5. There also are marathons scheduled for early 
February in Long Beach and Las Vegas, plus the Boston Marathon in April, 
further adding to the glut of springtime, 26.2-mile races. 
</P>
<P>
 Most marathon runners, world-class and middle-of-the-pack alike, run only two 
or three a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * There is the price tag -- a hefty $55 for the marathon, a more moderate $20 
for the 5K. Entrance fee for the L.A. Marathon is $35. 
</P>
<P>
 * Plans call for finishers to be led out of the park immediately after 
completing the course. In other words, no free day at Disneyland. Runners will 
have to buy a ticket just like everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 * The marathon course will be closed to finishers who haven't completed the 
route in less than five hours (a 12-minute per mile pace). The 5K course will 
be closed after an hour (a little less than 20-minute pace). Slow times to be 
sure, but something that could be perceived as harsh treatment at The Happiest 
Place on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the top U.S. marathons, including L.A., New York or Boston, have such 
provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably the main reason (for the cutoff) is that the park needs to open to 
the general public," Disneyland spokesman Joe Aguirre said. "Runners still out 
on the course would interfere with the operation of the park." 
</P>
<P>
 * There will be no appearance money for national- and world-class runners, 
which will no doubt complicate the matter of securing a top-notch field. 
</P>
<P>
 * There also will be a limit of 5,000 runners in each race with 1,500 entries 
set aside for international runners. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials said these races will be the first in an on-going series of 
events, and it's possible there will not be another Disneyland Marathon after 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Burke, L.A. Marathon director, said earlier that he received a letter of 
agreement from Disneyland organizers that the park would be host to 5K, 10K and 
half-marathon (13.1-mile) races in 1996, with marathon runners bused to L.A. to 
run in that event.

PGA TOUR READIES TO TAKE ON WORLD; GOLF: DETAILS OF THE NEW VENTURE WILL BE 
ANNOUNCED TODAY AND ORGANIZERS CAN EXPECT A FIGHT FOR PLAYERS.

<P>
 Ready or not, sports gets another golf tour today with a news conference at 
Sherwood Country Club to announce a new golf venture that has generated great 
controversy before its birth. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the World Tour, a joint project of Fox Television and a Florida event 
management firm, which a wary PGA Tour expects to be in operation in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there has been no announcement of the new tour, most of the 20 
players in the Franklin Funds Shark Shootout held a two-hour meeting with 
representatives of Fox and the event management firm, Executive Sports, on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Norman, a spokesman for the World Tour, said he couldn't comment on the 
planned tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fox will make the announcement (today) with John Montgomery and Scott 
Montgomery," said Norman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Montgomerys operate Executive Sports, an event firm based in Delray Beach, 
Fla., that manages various tournaments on the PGA Tour, the Senior PGA Tour and 
the LPGA tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are people with higher positions than I have and they want to make the 
announcement themselves," Norman said. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the World Tour already has been a source of deep concern for PGA Tour 
Commissioner Tim Finchem. The first-year commissioner released a statement 
Tuesday in which he expressed the PGA Tour's opposition to the rival tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Finchem said the World Tour plans eight to 10 events with prize money of more 
than $25 million, bankrolled by Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 Finchem also said the PGA Tour would not permit members to play the new tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Players received photocopies of Finchem's statement Tuesday. Brad Faxon, a 
member of the PGA Tour policy board, said the players' meeting Wednesday was 
for informational purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, you know what it's about," Faxon said. "The World Tour shown by 
Fox. I think the meeting was to get a good feel of what the players are 
thinking so that it's done the right way and we don't jeopardize our standing 
with the U.S. tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having tournaments like the (World Tour) is probably what everybody in the 
world wants to see -- the top players playing each other more often, and that's 
not done now." 
</P>
<P>
 "(But) it could be very detrimental to the (PGA) Tour," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Tour is arriving as the Federal Trade Commission continues its 
investigation of the PGA Tour for possible unfair methods of competition. 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent players from competing in World Tour events, Finchem said in his 
statement that the PGA Tour would enforce its television release and 
conflicting-event regulations -- the subject of the FTC investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 PGA Tour rules call for a player to apply for a release to play a different 
tournament when an official PGA Tour event is being held. If a player plays the 
15 events required to keep a PGA Tour card, the player can receive up to three 
releases. 
</P>
<P>
 The PGA Tour is taking a hard line on the World Tour. Fines and suspensions 
from the PGA Tour are possible for players who try it. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Palmer said he is surprised no one has tried a world tour before. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've said for years that there was going to be a world tour," he said. "I 
don't know what approach Greg is taking, but they need to put it together very, 
very carefully, with the blessings of the PGA Tour, the European tour and all 
the golf entities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hate to see anything interfere with the PGA Tour. It's been the 
lifeblood of golf and should continue to be the showcase of professional golf." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Norman would not comment directly on the World Tour on Wednesday, he 
made reference to it in a telephone conference call a little more than a month 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully some day down the line, a world tour will come into existence 
because I think it's needed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the world tour would be interspersed throughout the year and have it 
interface with the U.S. tour. I see a world tour being a tour between eight and 
15 tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd hate to see a world tour go out and try and fight (other) tours. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I would like to see it happen before I quit." 
</P>
<P>
 Norman has a wonderful swing and a great sense of timing.

TITAN BASKETBALL SIGNS TWO MEN, FOUR WOMEN

 Cal State Fullerton received letters of intent from six basketball players 
Wednesday, two men and four women. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Bob Hawking announced the signing of Mark Richardson, a 6-foot-7 forward 
from Ft.Wayne, Ind., and Brian Montonati, a 6-9 forward from Muskegon, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson, who played for Bishop Dwenger High, averaged 10 points and eight 
rebounds. Montonati, who played for Orchard View High, averaged 23 points and 
14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Women's Coach Deborah Ayres brought her recruiting total to eight players in 
the early signing period with the addition of Justine McMahon of Red Bluff 
High, Andrea Thieme of Alameda High and two players from the College of San 
Mateo, Patrice Johnson and Kathy Hankee. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, a 5-9 guard, averaged 12.3 points last season and Ayres calls her 
"one of the quickest point guards in the country." Hankee averaged 15.6 points 
and nine rebounds. Thieme averaged 20 points and McMahon 19 last season as high 
school juniors. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton also signed two softball players. Coach Judi Garman added Wendi 
Griffin of Garden Grove and Liza Brown of Rancho Cucamonga. Griffin holds her 
school's career records for runs batted in and stolen bases. Brown, a pitcher, 
was chosen MVP in her league and had a 0.15 earned-run average. LON EUBANKS

GIRLS' BASKETBALL 1994-1995: FREEWAY LEAGUE; FULLERTON'S HOERNER READY TO MAKE 
NOISE; BASKETBALL: AFTER TURNING THE OTHER CHEEK LAST SEASON, SHE WANTS TO LET 
OPPONENTS KNOW SHE WILL NOT BACK DOWN IN PURSUIT OF A TITLE, SCHOLARSHIP.

 Listening to Nadia Hoerner talk about the 1993-94 season with the Fullerton 
girls' basketball team, one gets the impression she was a pushover. 
</P>
<P>
 "I let people push me around," she said. "I decided I don't want to do that 
anymore, because then (opponents) look and say, 'She's nothing. We can push her 
around and she's not going to do anything.' So late last year, I started to 
change that, and over the spring and summer, I started playing more aggressive 
and took it more seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt the words of a timid bench warmer, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly. Hoerner averaged 20.2 points and 12.7 rebounds last year, leading the 
Freeway League in both categories. 
</P>
<P>
 But her coach, Marty Perez, says she merely scratched the surface of her 
talent last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she's one of the top five players in Orange County," said Perez, in 
his third year as Fullerton coach. "People are probably going to laugh at me 
for saying that, but I think it's there." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez said Hoerner will be much improved this season because he has seen her 
attitude and work ethic change. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Perez said the lure of a college scholarship might be a driving force. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, she was a little immature, and she didn't realize the importance 
of her junior year (for obtaining a scholarship)," he said. "She kind of had a 
lazy work ethic, and didn't take things like summer league very seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plus, she's an unselfish ballplayer. She likes to spread the scoring around. 
But this year, she needs to be more selfish. Once she realizes that, she'll be 
dominant." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoerner, a 6-foot-3 center, said getting a scholarship is a high priority, but 
she is motivated by a more immediate concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's one goal I want: a league championship," she said. "Last year, we 
were close with Troy, and it came down to three and two points difference. I 
decided after Troy beat us last year, that they weren't going to do it this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 "Losing it makes you want it more. You go after everything and not give up at 
all. When it's not there, you're like, 'Ohhh, no.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Hoerner knows about achieving goals. She played an important role on 
Fullerton's Division II-champion softball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoerner had a key triple in the 12th inning of the Indians' 2-0 upset victory 
over fourth-seeded Lakewood in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 She also had two hits in a 3-1 victory over La Puente Bishop Amat in the 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the best," she said. "Nobody thought we could do it. We had no chance 
at all. Our team was not so good at first, but winning (the Southern Section 
title) brought our whole school together."  
</P>
<P>
 Hoerner said she expects to play basketball or volleyball in college, and 
plans on majoring in sports medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to get a scholarship for college," she said. "It doesn't need to be 
some high-profile school. I'd just like to go and play. There will always be 
pressure wherever I go, but I don't want to go to some school where there's all 
the pressure if you don't win, you know?" 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine, Loyola Marymount and Utah had shown preliminary interest in 
Hoerner but have since backed off. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez, however, said he believes that will change. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she's going to surprise a lot of people this year," he said. "I think 
by the end of this year, some of those colleges that gave up on her will be 
back." 1993-94 / IN REVIEW

 Troy's unblemished league record survived two scares from Fullerton. The 
Warriors won, 55-52, at Troy, and escaped, 56-54, at Fullerton. . . . Troy's 
Jennie Gadd, who averaged 18 points, was the league MVP. Fullerton's Nadia 
Hoerner was the league's leading scorer with a 20.2 average and leading 
rebounder at 12.7 per game. . . . The Warriors had a tough draw in the first 
round of the Southern Section Division II-A playoffs: Compton Dominguez (20-8). 
"Everybody said, 'Good luck with Dominguez--they're big, they're fast,' " Troy 
Coach Brad Sand said. But the Warriors won, 52-39, led by Dinah Shah's 19 
points and seven assists. Troy then beat Canyon, 46-30, led by Audra Gamst's 13 
points, setting up a game with Cypress in the quarterfinals. The score was 
tied, 35-35, entering the fourth quarter. "They were playing a zone (defense), 
and in the first three quarters, we hit our jumpers," Sand said. "In the fourth 
quarter, we couldn't make a basket." On the other end of the floor, Jessica 
Eggleston scored 18 second-half points as Cypress won, 52-39. Fullerton never 
really had a chance in Division III-AA. The Indians drew Brea-Olinda, the 
eventual State Division III champion, in the first round and were eliminated, 
90-36. La Habra also had an early exit; the Highlanders lost to Magnolia, 
40-38, in a wild-card game. La Habra and Troy each had three players on the 
all-league team.

 Koehler said the league race "will be a real dogfight. There are three teams 
(Troy, La Habra and Fullerton) so evenly matched, it's unbelievable." Koehler 
said he usually runs an offense with two post players, but will adjust because 
of Lien's skills. "She has a good perimeter shot from about 15 feet, she's real 
quick, and she's a leaper," he said. "She's got a lot of strength, and we're 
going to let her operate one-on-one inside." Brooke Koehler was the team's 
leading scorer last season, averaging 7.8 points. This year, she has improved 
her ability to drive to the basket. The Highlanders, aside from Lien, are 
short, which could hurt in a league filled with talented post players. "Height 
will be a problem," Koehler said. "We have to run, press and rattle the other 
team a little bit. We're going to go after them and create activity." SCHEDULE

 Kameoka, who averaged 14 points last season and was a first-team all-league 
selection, returns for her fourth year on varsity. "She's really competitive," 
Del Crognale said. "She's a really good shooter, but her hindrance is that 
she's only 5 feet 3." And therein lies the Lancers' biggest problem: Del 
Crognale says he probably won't have any starters taller than 5-9. "This is my 
third year coaching here, and the first year, I thought we were short. Since 
then, we've gotten shorter every year. That's a scary thought." Gonzales and 
Kaminiski, who was the junior varsity's most valuable player, should provide 
rebounding and defensive help. "(Gonzales) is the enforcer," Del Crognale said. 
He said he doesn't expect much scoring from either player. Kameoka and 
Kaneshiro will start in the backcourt, but Chen might play some at point guard, 
depending on how soon she adapts to varsity play. The Lancers must make up for 
their lack of height with tenacity, Del Crognale said. "We've got some 
aggressive girls and some good shooters, it's just a matter of getting some 
rebounds." SCHEDULE

 There are no delusions of grandeur here. While most coaches hope for a shot at 
a league title or a playoff berth, Reed has set simple goals: Keep all games 
close and win five of them. Reed said his biggest task will be finding a 
replacement for graduated point guard Carrie Arakaki. "She handled the ball, 
ran the offense and basically did everything," he said. "Our biggest problem is 
finding someone who can handle the ball to get the offense started. That was a 
big problem this summer, but I think we'll have it ironed out by league play." 
He said he hopes Placilla can fill that role. With no returning starters and 
very inexperienced returners, Reed said he is ready for a long season. "I feel 
if we win two games, we're doing good. We don't have a lot of basketball 
talent; we have girls who come out and play the game as hard as they can." He 
said the team's strength will be defense. And though the outlook appears bleak, 
Reed says he is still looking forward to the season "because there could be 
some surprises," he said. "We might win more than five, six, seven games. But 
our skill level is not what other schools are." SCHEDULE

 The Warriors return the league's most valuable player, Gadd, and a tough 
leader, Shah. "Pound-for-pound, (Shah) is probably the toughest player in 
Orange County," Sand said. "She'll take a charge from someone twice her size. I 
love having her on the team." Sand said Gadd keeps improving. "Her athletic 
ability is rising, and she will have a more well-rounded game." Gadd and Shah 
have started every game the past three seasons. Hardeman, daughter of P.J. 
Hardeman, the Troy boys' coach, played in Brea-Olinda's developmental programs, 
and Sand said she is ready to contribute. "She'll probably be our best 
shooter," he said. "She understands the game well, and she'll probably start." 
Sand's teams have won the last two league titles, but lost in the quarterfinals 
both years. "We feel we should be one of the top three teams in (the Southern 
Section), and we want to go as far as we can," Sand said. Trying to hold off La 
Habra and Fullerton should prepare the Warriors for the playoffs. SCHEDULE

 After tying La Habra for second place last season, Perez returns a team that 
is big, quick and experienced. "My seniors have played together the last three 
years, and they know each other real well," he said. "We have a lot of team 
speed. We'll try to run-and-gun a lot." Perez expects his backcourt of Higgins 
and Darke to press and trap frequently, to try to take advantage of a new rule 
forbidding teams from re-entering the backcourt. But the key to this team is 
Nadia Hoerner. She led the Freeway League in scoring with 21 points per game. 
"She can be a dominating player if she does in games what she does in 
practice," he said. "You hate to depend on one player so much, but I'd be a 
fool not to take advantage of her ability." Perez is also excited about 
Cooper's offensive skills. "She's an excellent shooter, a good three-point 
shooter, a good defender and has good court sense." She will play both guard 
positions. Clark, MacShane and Shannon Hoerner will provide front-court depth.

 Harpster, who has never coached varsity girls' basketball, becomes the 
Raiders's second coach in as many seasons. She said this year probably will be 
a rebuilding one. "I think we'll be able to hang with a few (teams), but teams 
like Troy and Fullerton, they're awesome," Harpster said. "But if we execute 
like I know we can, we can give a few teams a scare." She said speed will e the 
team's strength. The rebuilding effort is being focused around Nash, who 
averaged 18 points and earned first-team all-league honors last year. "If we 
can have a balanced offense she can do even more," Harpster said. "She's a 
smart player -- she knows the game of basketball inside and out." Harpster 
expects Saldana to provide decent shooting from 12 to 15 feet. Shelby will take 
some of the ballhandling pressure off Nash. Though DeOliva is only 5-8, 
Harpster said she expects her to e an effective rebounder." She plays big," 
Harpster said. SCHEDULE

TAFT AND PALISADES RENEW TENNIS TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is becoming almost a pre-Thanksgiving family reunion for the girls' tennis 
teams of Taft and Palisades highs. 
</P>
<P>
 For the seventh consecutive season, Taft (15-0) and Palisades (14-0) will meet 
in the City Section 4-A Division final, which starts at 2 p.m. today at the 
Racquet Centre. 
</P>
<P>
 Palisades has won four of these showdowns, Taft the past two by 6-1 scores. 
</P>
<P>
 But Taft will defend its title without Brahna Pastorini, the City champion who 
graduated in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Julia Feldman, who has a 46-0 record in team play over three seasons, leads a 
strong group of singles players. But Taft has been inconsistent this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day we look powerful, the next day the match is close," Taft Coach Marvin 
Jones said. "You can win pretty or you can win ugly, but you take a win any way 
you can get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Taft slipped past University, 4-3, in Monday's semifinals while Palisades 
routed Granada Hills, 7-0.  
</P>
<P>
 Taft has beaten Granada Hills by scores of 6-1 and 4-3. The Dolphins twice 
swept University, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
 For Taft, Nos. 2 and 3 singles players Ravid Levi and Alicia Whelan are each 
3-0 since switching from No. 1 doubles. The pair were 12-0 at doubles. Marissa 
Parker is 13-2 at No. 4 singles. 
</P>
<P>
 "My team is pretty solid," Jones said. "Our No. 1 goal was to get to the 
final. It wasn't to go undefeated or be perfect. We made it."

TURKEYS FOR NEEDY ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY; CHARITY: GROUPS THAT PROVIDE 
THANKSGIVING MEALS AND BASKETS SEEK BARGAIN BUYS, HOPE FOR DONATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This Thanksgiving, charities across Orange County are hoping for a turkey-week 
miracle. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey of charitable organizations Wednesday found that whether they have 
received few donations or have adequate supplies for next Thursday's 
celebration, almost all still need turkeys -- the item that separates a 
Thanksgiving meal from any other free lunch during the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had turkeys galore last year," said Margie Wakeham, director of Irvine 
Temporary Housing Inc., which expects to feed at least 150 families this 
Thanksgiving, "and I haven't seen those turkeys roll down the hall yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Some soup kitchens and food pantries say they are low on food supplies but 
expect a rush of donations in the next few days for their Thanksgiving basket 
giveaways and dinners. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is typical not to have much in right now," said Karen McGlinn, executive 
director of Costa Mesa's Share Our Selves, which provides bag lunches 
year-round for the working poor and no-income families. "We won't get donations 
until next Tuesday or Wednesday. I believe people are caring and giving even 
during poor economic times. So I expect to receive an abundance of 
contributions." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the shortage of donated turkeys, most of these organizations say 
the No. 1 item on their shopping list will be the gobbler. Lately, they have 
been scanning the newspapers for those advertisements that promise, "buy one, 
get one free" or "purchase $100 in groceries and get a free turkey." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking for a store that is offering a good price on turkeys," said 
Judy Mader, a director at Catholic Charities Outreach in Santa Ana. "We've 
called Foster Farms and Zacky and they aren't budging on those turkey prices. 
We're still hoping for the turkey miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 So Mader's agency has received about $2,500 worth of food, including 40 to 50 
turkeys. But that has to be stretched to fill food baskets for some 400 
families, she said. So if there are no turkey donations, the needy will get a 
basket of goodies like rice, beans, peanut butter and cookies -- but no 
Thanksgiving bird. 
</P>
<P>
 Some organizers believe community-based charities will be the beneficiaries of 
the supermarkets' annual cost-cutting competition on turkey prices.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of (donors) wait to get their turkeys so they can take advantage of 
sales," said McGlinn, who has not seen any of the buy-one-get-one-free 
advertisements she saw last year. "I think that might be a reason why we have 
not received very much at all in terms of turkey, ham or chickens -- nothing 
noticeable at all." 
</P>
<P>
 While few stores had offered those bargains as of Thursday, several began 
advertising turkeys for as little as 19 cents a pound with a minimum purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the lack of turkeys, many groups reported receiving generous 
contributions of other food and money from the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Temporary Housing Inc. began Wednesday to organize the 40 shopping 
carts of food it has received. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Irvine community is very generous. This is the season to give and they 
are keeping up with what they gave before. I don't see any sort of shortfall in 
contributions," Wakeham said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Southwest Community Center in Santa Ana, which fed dinner to about 500 
people last year, has not received a single donation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had phone calls for possible donations, but it looks like it might have 
to come out of our pockets," said Thelma Minor, the organization's secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Minor is optimistic, though, saying that in the past food donations were made 
on the Monday before Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite reported upturns in the economy, several organizers of local charities 
said the demand on their services remains high. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are seeing more need with families that lost jobs a year or two ago and 
are now semi-employed or unemployed," Wakeham said. "There are families who 
have gone through all their savings and resources and are now beginning to 
bounce at the bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps saddest for Wakeham is that at least five families who have made 
donations to her group's Thanksgiving baskets in the past are on the receiving 
end this year. A Holiday Helping Hand 
</P>

dinners and distribute holiday food baskets next week. Donations of food, money

CREATING A STIR; ARTIST, CITY CLASH OVER COLORFUL EXPRESSION OF PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To some observers, the colorful swirl of flowers, branches and berries that 
Joe Mangrum has created on Main Beach here is, well, just a colorful swirl of 
flowers, branches and berries. 
</P>
<P>
 But to Mangrum, his piece of "public art" -- which he meticulously assembles 
by day only to have city cleaning crews sweep away by night -- has come to 
symbolize the struggle of creativity against rigid bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The artwork in question was conceived as Mangrum's pro-environmental protest 
against construction of the San Joaquin Hills toll road through the gentle 
Laguna Canyon, a project that has inflamed emotions in this coastal community. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, his pique has been redirected toward the city, which informed him 
Wednesday that he must obtain a permit and a $1-million liability insurance 
policy to keep his artwork at Main Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also told him he'd have to move his nine-foot circle of nature from 
its grassy perch to a nearby cobblestone area designated for displays that 
reflect free expression. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think it's a ridiculous idea to have to have insurance to politically 
protest," he said Wednesday as pigeons pecked at his masterpiece. "I think this 
city's gotten a little too expensive for artists." 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, there is a certain spiritual benefit to his suffering: "I think the 
more the city destroys it, the stronger the piece becomes." 
</P>
<P>
 From the city's perspective, this isn't so much about art as keeping city 
parks and beaches tidy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if it was a Van Gogh painting, our Municipal Services (Department) 
people would pick up that painting and remove it from the beach," recreation 
director Pat Barry said. "He wants to leave something there overnight and have 
me guarantee it will be there the next morning. I simply cannot do that." 
</P>
<P>
 The saga began last week when Mangrum, a traveling "environmental artist," 
began collecting twigs, kumquats, feathers and other bits of nature that caught 
his eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the weekend, he fitted the pieces together on the highly visible patch of 
grass at Main Beach, a city-owned park. 
</P>
<P>
 When he returned Monday morning to again behold his creation, it was gone, 
cleared away by city groundskeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted, he set to work again, and by Tuesday morning, the area was again 
wiped clean. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after investing 100 hours into his project, he was fed up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been having to run out and collect stuff every day because they demolish 
everything I do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mangrum, 25, complained to the City Council on Tuesday night and was 
encouraged to talk to Barry. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the two did not share a meeting of the minds. 
</P>
<P>
 "What he is doing to him may be a piece of art," Barry said Wednesday. "But it 
was no different than you or me leaving a beach chair or a backpack in the park 
and having the expectation that when we come back tomorrow it would still be 
sitting there." 
</P>
<P>
 Barry suggested that Mangrum keep re-creating his artwork at the beach each 
day or get an outdoor exhibit permit and display his piece at the Irvine Bowl, 
as city law provides. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, he could find a sympathetic property owner willing to display the art on 
private land, Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mangrum, who said he has a bachelor of fine arts degree from the School of 
the Art Institute of Chicago, said his art is "very site specific" and belongs 
where it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who gathered Wednesday to gaze upon Mangrum's palette of blossoms, 
branches, sand and sea shells seemed to approve. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's really sharp, Laguna Beach resident Jim Hohn said. "I think they 
should probably just leave him alone and let him do it. I don't think it hurts 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
 "A grass-roots art movement needs room to grow in Laguna, exactly as the young

EIGHT TEENS ARE ARRESTED IN SLAYING OF STUDENT, 15; CRIME: YOUTH KILLED IN 
GARDEN GROVE DRIVE-BY SHOOTING WASN'T A GANG MEMBER. TEACHERS LAUDED HIM.

 Police arrested eight teen-agers Wednesday, five of them at local high 
schools, in connection with the drive-by killing of a highly praised student 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Cesar Torres, a 15-year-old sophomore at Garden Grove High School, was shot 
and killed Nov. 5 and two other boys were injured as they left a birthday party 
on a quiet residential street. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they believe the shooting grew out of a rivalry between two "party 
crews," loosely knit groups of young people who get together for weekend 
parties at homes or warehouses. Garden Grove Police Capt. David Abrecht said 
party crews generally are less violent and territorial than gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the two crews "had some differences in the recent past," Abrecht 
said, which police believe led to the shooting in the 11600 block of Faye 
Avenue, just before 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Abrecht said investigators identified the suspects through witness statements 
and interviews and from evidence seized through a dozen search warrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends said Torres was not involved in gangs and that he had been threatened 
by some gang members for ignoring them. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Ruben Delgado, 18, of Garden Grove and three male juveniles were 
arrested at Rancho Alamitos High School in Garden Grove, Abrecht said. Another 
juvenile suspect was arrested at Ocean View High School in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The three others arrested were Anthony Vergara, 18, of Garden Grove and two 
juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
 All eight were booked on suspicion of murder, attempted murder and conspiracy, 
Abrecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 The identities of the juveniles were not released, but Abrecht said they were 
all boys 16 to 17 years old and lived in Garden Grove, Stanton and Huntington 
Beach. All were taken to Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The two 18-year-olds were held without bail at Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres was described by classmates, teachers and employers as a hard-working, 
conscientious young person. When he had difficulty in school with math, he took 
summer courses. 
</P>
<P>
 He was concerned about appropriate dress on his summer job, working for a 
city-run program for disadvantaged youths doing maintenance for the school 
district. Co-workers said Torres spoke of using his paycheck to buy a birthday 
present for one of his siblings.

2 MEN ARE SHOT; 5 TEENS ARRESTED; CRIME: POLICE SAY CHANCE ENCOUNTER TURNED 
VIOLENT IN SHOPPING CENTER IN NORMALLY TRANQUIL IRVINE.

 Gunshots fired in a Woodbridge shopping center parking lot left two young men 
hospitalized Wednesday and five Orange County youths jailed on suspicion of 
attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that about 11:30 p.m. Tuesday, young people in two cars met by 
chance in the Alton Square Shopping Center at Alton Parkway and Jeffrey Road, 
and the suspects forced the other car to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "They got out and started speaking to each other in a threatening manner," Lt. 
Sam Allevato said. One of the suspects drew a semi-automatic gun, but he was 
tackled by someone from the other car, Allevato said. "The gun went flying in 
the air, and one of the juvenile suspects picked it up and fired eight to 10 
times, striking the two victims." 
</P>
<P>
 The five suspects are associated with a gang, Allevato said. The victims 
apparently are not, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the violence shook the city of Irvine, which just two months ago was 
named by Money Magazine as the safest city in the nation with a population of 
100,000 or more. The FBI ranked Irvine the 10th-safest city in that category in 
the nation in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised, not only in the location of the shooting, which was in front 
of a doughnut store, but that there were juveniles out at 11:30 on a school 
night," Irvine Mayor Michael Ward said. "Where are the parents?"  
</P>
<P>
 Ward said he considers the shooting "a crying shame," that warrants community 
attention to prevent a recurrence. But he also emphasized, "This does not mean 
Irvine is not safe. There are communities in Southern California where this 
happens every night." 
</P>
<P>
 Ward said the last shooting in Irvine involving gang members occurred two 
years ago at Stonecreek Shopping Center, also in the upscale Woodbridge 
community.  
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, only a Ralphs supermarket, a doughnut shop and a service station 
were open at Alton Square when the shooting broke out.  
</P>
<P>
 One witness, a 21-year-old Irvine man, said he was leaving Star Doughnuts when 
he heard gunfire and saw the suspects leaving in their car, shooting parting 
shots at the victims who were running to a public phone to call for help. One 
of those shots hit the sign shop window, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses provided a description of the suspects' car, an Acura Legend, and 
its license plate number. Garden Grove police stopped the suspects within an 
hour on Garden Grove Boulevard at the Garden Grove Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims were identified as Phillip Kotangian, 20, of Whittier, who was 
shot in the back, and Daniel Vartanian, 20, of Montebello, who was shot in the 
left arm and lower back. Both were in stable condition at a Santa Ana hospital, 
police said.  
</P>
<P>
 Arrested on suspicion of attempted murder were Dan Trung Hoang, 19, of 
Anaheim; Thanh Ngoc Phan, 19, of Irvine; a 16-year-old Westminster girl; a 
17-year-old Irvine boy, and a 16-year-old Fullerton boy.

GADFLY MAKES ABSENCE FELT AT LAGUNA COUNCIL MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council meeting was just too quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in nearly 20 years, council gadfly Alan Adams wasn't there 
Tuesday night to harangue city officials about the budget or services for 
seniors.Before what would have been the 79-year-old's 397th consecutive council 
meeting, officials learned that Adams had been seriously injured in a car 
accident on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep Adams' amazing attendance streak intact, the council unanimously 
granted a proclamation of "honorary attendance." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was deeply saddened when I heard," said Councilman Robert F. Gentry, who 
has withstood his share of scoldings from Adams in his 12 years on the dais. 
"Mr. Adams is a fixture at City Hall and part of our culture and how we do 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams, a retired businessman, has also gained local fame for wearing the same 
blue T-shirt to meetings. The shirt proclaims in white letters: "I'm not a 
tourist, I live here." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Adams was still in critical condition in the intensive-care ward 
of Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really concerned about him," Gentry said. "Some people see him as a 
gadfly . . . and some see him as an angry activist. But I see him as a 
committed citizen with sincere beliefs."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: PLACENTIA; COUNCIL TO SPEND $2.7 MILLION TO BUILD 13-ACRE 
PARK

<P>
 The City Council has agreed to spend $2.7 million to create a 13-acre park, 
the last expected to be built in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 East Placentia Park, to be built at the corner of Alta Vista and Jefferson 
streets, will feature two Little League baseball diamonds and one adult 
baseball field, two soccer fields, a day-care center, a community room, two 
"tot lots" with playgrounds for small children, restrooms, a concession stand 
and three parking lots with space for 120 cars, said Christopher Becker, 
director of public works. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials had expected to spend $3.1 million to build the park, but 
Becker and his staff reworked the specifications for the project and obtained 
lower bids after the council rejected higher ones in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of the real Cadillac, we still have a workable project but we have 
saved some money," Becker told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction is expected to begin in January and the park is expected to open 
by spring, he said.HOLLY J. WAGNER

<P>
 Retiring County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder received a lasting tribute 
Wednesday: a planned 106-acre regional park was renamed in her honor. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 people turned out for a dedication ceremony at the site, formerly 
known as Bolsa Chica Linear Park.The park area is located on the southeast edge 
of the Bolsa Chica wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisor expressed satisfaction at seeing Harriett M. Wieder Regional 
Park come to fruition while she is in office. 
</P>
<P>
 "This tremendous honor validates all that I've done and the commitment I've 
had to the development of a park in the 2nd District," she said. "I have fought 
for this park for 16 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder retires from the Board of Supervisors on Jan. 3. Huntington Beach 
Councilman Jim Silva was elected to Wieder's seat last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder called the park "another jewel in the necklace of the county's park 
system." 
</P>
<P>
 "What is significant is that there is no regional park in this part of the 
county," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder is a former Huntington Beach mayor. Under Wieder's leadership, in 1976, 
the city donated part of its land to the county for park use. In exchange, the 
county agreed to be responsible for the park's planning, development, 
maintenance and operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "In generations to come, they will say 'Who is Harriett Wieder?' And I hope 
they will know it was someone who cared enough to plan this park," Wieder said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county is developing a habitat restoration plan for about 19 acres of the 
park, which includes restoring native grasslands and coastal sage scrub. 
</P>
<P>
 Planting will begin on 3.3 acres of the park next fall. The park is scheduled 
to open in the spring of 1996.DEBRA CANO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; CITY TO PAINT LIFEGUARD FACILITY CAPE COD 
BLUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The multicolored exterior of lifeguard headquarters will soon be replaced with 
a more sedate Cape Cod blue as the city looks to tone down the crazy quilt of 
colors on buildings around the pier area. 
</P>
<P>
 The outgoing color scheme was airbrushed onto the lifeguard headquarters about 
eight years ago for the filming of a scene for "Tequila and Bonetti," a 
short-lived television detective show.It was the first time the building had 
been painted since its construction in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 After the filming was over, a survey of nearby residents indicated they wanted 
to leave the garish colors intact. 
</P>
<P>
 But no longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the years have gone by, people have grown tired of it and are ready for a 
change," said Andy Seymour, city director of parks and recreation. "It's rather 
bizarre looking." 
</P>
<P>
 The lifeguard headquarters and surrounding buildings will be painted a light 
blue-gray color with white trim. Councilwoman Marilyn Bruce Hastings says the 
Cape Cod motif will make beachfront buildings more attractive to residents and 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of people will be relieved to have it painted," said Hastings, 
who represents the surfside community on the council. "It distracts from really 
looking at the ocean and looking at the view. It will be nice to have a certain 
conformity in the pier area rather than a hodgepodge of colors." 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to eventually convert all lifeguard towers, parking attendant 
structures and the Ruby's restaurant at the end of the pier to the new color 
scheme.RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; STUDENTS, INSTRUCTORS URGED TO GET TB 
TESTS

 County health officials have recommended that about 100 classmates and 
instructors of a student at Golden West College who had active tuberculosis be 
screened for exposure to the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials learned last week that the student, who attended four classes 
during much of the fall semester, had active disease and might have been 
contagious for two or three weeks while in school, college and county health 
officials said.The student, who was not identified, left school about three 
weeks ago and is under medical treatment at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has notified the student's 98 classmates and four course 
instructors of their possible exposure and recommended they undergo in-class 
skin-test screening Nov. 28-29. The tests will be read at the college later in 
the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who have positive tests, indicating exposure to TB, will be given 
X-rays and other follow-up examinations and will be offered medication if 
necessary. Many people who have positive skin tests do not develop active 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 TB is spread through the air when a person with infectious TB in the lungs 
coughs, sneezes, laughs or sings. While anyone can develop TB, those in close 
contact with an infectious person for a prolonged period of time are at 
greatest risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone seeking information on tuberculosis may call the Orange County Health 
Care Agency at (714) 834-8790. Free screening is available at the County 
Pulmonary Diseases Service, 1725 W. 17th St. in Santa Ana. No appointment is 
necessary.JULIE MARQUIS

<TEXT>
<P>
 More water -- almost double the amount previously available -- is on tap for 
the city with completion this week of a new reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
 The reservoir has been under construction for the past two years and has cost 
the city $1,736,019, said Public Works Director Ismile H. Noorbaksh. 
</P>
<P>
 The project's costs ran 3% over the bid amount because of weather and terrain 
difficulties, Noorbaksh added. Money for the reservoir came from the city's 
redevelopment fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "The importance of this is that it provides the city with the flow necessary 
to put out fires, plus it develops the holding capacity of the city's water 
system," Noorbaksh said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We previously only had (water) capacity for about 2 1/2 million gallons. Now, 
(the new reservoir) increases capacity to about 4 1/2 million gallons. So this 
provides capacity we need for emergency purposes in the event of a disaster, 
such as fires or an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It also provides access for new businesses wanting to come into the city. We 
can assure them that we do have necessary flow of water they may need." BILL

 The city has set aside $450,000 in redevelopment funds to help landlords 
upgrade their apartments in exchange for making the units available to 
lower-income renters. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council recently approved the Rental Rehabilitation Program to 
compensate for federal housing programs that have been discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is still a need to help property rental owners," said May Hui, 
assistant director of development services. "The city will assist them in 
rehabilitating their units, and in exchange for that, we want long-term 
affordability." 
</P>
<P>
 The agency hopes to rehabilitate 18 to 25 apartment units with the funds, 
which come from property taxes and community development block grants, Hui 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Landlords can apply for zero-interest loans of up to $20,000 per apartment. 
That loan will be forgiven after 30 years if the apartments remain affordable. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the median income is $58,800 for a family of four. That same 
family making $39,900 would be considered low income, according to the city's 
redevelopment agency. LESLEY WRIGHT

operate Pacific Amphitheatre at the Orange County Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Fair Board of Directors unanimously approved a three-year 
contract last week at its board meeting. The decision ends months of no music 
after the fairgrounds bought back the facility from the Nederlander 
Organization, which had been booking loud bands and causing complaints among 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a four-member panel recommended as long ago as the beginning of 
October that SMG manage the 8,500-seat facility, the board's vote was delayed 
after Irvine Meadows Partners, one of five companies competing for the 
position, filed a protest on Oct. 19, claiming it had been the lowest 
responsible bidder. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Nov. 9, the company withdrew its complaint, citing no particular 
reasons, and the board voted on the matter the next day, according to the 
fairgrounds press office. TOM RAGAN

 Residents of El Niguel Heights received city approval Tuesday to gate their 
community, five years after they first decided to privatize their streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted 4 to 0 with one abstention to let the quiet hilltop 
neighborhood install gates on Augusta Drive at Niguel Road and on Glen Abby 
Drive at Club House Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was met with enthusiastic applause from about 200 residents who 
had donned green ribbons to show their support for privatization. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should have been a slam dunk," said Councilman Thomas W. Wilson, who 
approved giving two dozen city streets to the El Niguel Heights Homeowners 
Assn. "All we should be doing is approving the will of the people." 
</P>
<P>
 The request for gates ran into trouble at the Planning Commission. Concerned 
about access to the public Seminole Park, the commission had required that park 
users be let in through the unguarded Glen Abby gate just by pushing a button. 
</P>
<P>
 This was opposed by residents, who said they wanted gates to keep out 
speeders, vandals and crooks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't force us to guard our front door while we leave our back door wide 
open," resident Maureen Parent said at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the council's decision, only residents and their guests will be able to 
pass through the Glen Abby gate. Non-residents will be able to access Seminole 
Park through the Augusta Drive gate during daylight hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the measure had said gates would fragment the city and take away 
streets that taxpayers had paid for. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Janet Godfrey sided with them, saying she believed gated communities 
inhibit friendliness. She said she decided to abstain rather than vote "no" 
because gate proponents had spoken eloquently in favor of privatization. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've moved three-quarters of an inch to the 'pro' side," she said. "And I'm 
mad as hops about it. It offends my humanistic side." LYNN FRANEY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ORANGE; SCHOOL EMPLOYEES WILL SEEK RECALL OF DISTRICT 
TRUSTEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The union of non-teaching employees of Orange Unified School District voted 
Wednesday night to launch a recall effort against trustee Max Reissmueller. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a detriment to the public school system," said Becky Mayers, president 
of the 1,160-member Chapter 67 of the California School Employees Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayers started working on the recall effort last month, when Reissmueller 
pulled his 6-year-old daughter out of the district's schools and started 
teaching her at home under a program he called Orange Christian Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taking his child out of public schools is just a slap in the face to the 
teachers, the classified employees and the community," Mayers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reissmueller further angered teachers and classified workers by staunchly 
promoting privatization of district schools at school board meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Reissmueller said he was "indifferent" to the union vote because the unions do 
not represent the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have more faith in our community to see past the political BS," he said. 
"If I was truly doing something that the community at large thought was wrong, 
then I wouldn't fight that at all." 
</P>
<P>
 David Reger, president of the teachers' union, is also concerned about 
community support for a recall. Union officials are discussing the issue and 
will speak with their attorney about it Monday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's going to happen, it has to happen with both the teachers and 
classified unions united as well as with community support; all three of those 
things must be there," he said, adding that Reissmueller is "an embarrassment" 
to the district. "We would be happy to see Max Reissmueller off the board no 
matter which way it occurs," he said. LESLEY WRIGHT

<P>
 Despite his outsider status, Councilman-elect Eddie Rose has pledged a spirit 
of cooperation with others on the five-member panel when he takes office next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't be combative on every issue," said Rose, a 56-year-old engineer who 
placed second in the Nov. 8 election behind incumbent Patricia C. Bates, a 
local political fixture since before the city's incorporation five years ago. 
"But the people have voted and said they don't want a rubber stamp." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Christiansen, a former councilman who placed fourth out of nine hopefuls 
last week, said that Rose's election "will probably make the body politic more 
mature because there will be differences of style and opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 During his three campaigns for a council seat, Rose has accused council 
members of pandering to developers' wants while ignoring taxpayers' needs. He 
also lambasted the council for giving City Manager Tim Casey what the new 
councilman termed an excessive salary and benefits package. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose's theme of an out-of-touch council apparently struck a chord with some 
voters. Rose captured 15.4% of the vote. The third-place finisher, Planning 
Commissioner Linda Lindholm, received 11.3% of the vote. But Bates, 54, 
attracted the most support, with nearly one of every three voters casting 
ballots for her. She said she interpreted the election results as a vote of 
confidence in the current council. 
</P>
<P>
 Bates said she will continue to focus on how the El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station is used once the Marines depart in 1999, and on keeping the city 
financially secure. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose said he hopes to introduce more recreational activities for teen-agers, 
and to investigate building a municipal golf course. He also wants to appoint 
new people to city commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had lost, I would have had to give my Richard Nixon speech and say 'You 
won't have Eddie Rose to kick around anymore,' " he said. LYNN FRANEY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; DEALER AGREES TO SETTLE IN SMOG CHECK CASE

<P>
 A Garden Grove used car dealership accused by the state of issuing falsified 
smog check certificates has agreed to a $300,000 settlement.  
</P>
<P>
 As part of the settlement, Garden Grove Used Cars agreed to pay $187,500 in 
civil penalties and investigative costs, and $62,500 to help the state Bureau 
of Automotive Repair purchase or repair high-polluting vehicles, according to 
officials with the state Department of Consumer Affairs.Garden Grove Used Cars, 
13831 Harbor Blvd., is owned by Toyota of Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 cars were "clean piped" at Garden Grove Used Cars between 
January, 1992, and August, 1993, state authorities said. Clean piping involves 
using the emissions readings of a clean vehicle while entering information for 
another vehicle that wasn't tested. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the settlement, Garden Grove Used Cars also forfeited its smog 
check license, and its automotive repair dealer registration was placed on two 
years' probation. Also, the dealer must contact consumers who purchased used 
cars that might not have been properly inspected. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials said the settlement did not involve Toyota of Garden Grove's 
new car facility at 9444 Trask Ave. MARTIN MILLER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; MAN FOUND FATALLY STABBED IN PARKING LOT

<P>
 A 27-year-old man was found stabbed to death early Wednesday morning in a 
restaurant parking lot in Little Saigon, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Garden Grove resident was attacked in a strip mall lot in the 10500 block 
of Bolsa Avenue and suffered multiple stab wounds.The attack may have involved 
more than one assailant, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police declined to release the victim's name Wednesday, saying they had not 
yet contacted his family. 
</P>
<P>
 A passerby called police sometime after 11 p.m. Tuesday night to report a 
wounded man in the parking lot. When police arrived, they found the dead man 
and blood on his car and nearby bushes. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they do not know why officers didn't arrive at the scene until 
after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Police do not believe the victim was robbed because his wallet was found in 
his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 At the intersection of Bolsa and Ward, a generally peaceful corner where the 
strip mall is located, most business owners were unaware of the killing 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst violence I ever heard of was a car break-in and the stereo was 
stolen a few months back," said a doctor's assistant, whose office in the strip 
mall. "But this is frightening news. It makes me think about how we should 
schedule our work hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent Truong, manager of the Kim Su Restaurant, was alarmed by the killing 
but said he does not plan to increase security at his restaurant, located not 
far from where the body was found. Truong currently employs two security 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things like this usually don't happen. This is probably an isolated 
incident," Truong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have no suspects in the attack and are continuing their investigation.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; THREE SCHOOL BOARD VICTORS FORM MAJORITY

 In last week's election, voters turned over control of the Westminster School 
District Board of Trustees to newcomers who have said they plan to improve the 
district's language program for limited-English students and spur parents to 
greater involvement in district policy-making. 
</P>
<P>
 They were elected to fill the seats vacated by trustees Margie Rice and Ron 
Morgan, who did not seek reelection, while incumbent Sheryl Neugebauer lost in 
her bid to remain on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Covey, Sondra Rinker and Michael L. Verrengia captured the most votes in 
the field of nine and they are a majority on the five-member board. 
</P>
<P>
 Rinker, Verrengia and Covey said in interviews this week that they planned to 
enhance the district's English immersion program. 
</P>
<P>
 Verrengia, 44, said he sees no immediate need to alter other programs or to 
"cut any programs whatsoever. Everything has pretty much been pared down to the 
bone." 
</P>
<P>
 Rinker, 30, said she would investigate whether future budget cuts could come 
from administrative positions, instead of positions that directly affect the 
classroom, adding that "we need to see where the money is being spent." 
</P>
<P>
 Calling for greater parental involvement in district decisions, Covey, 44, 
said she wants "parents to be more informed and feel that they can come to me 
and talk to me. That's the most important thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Kathy Stirling Iverson said she believes the new and current board 
members will be able to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job is to work with them and I don't think it's going to be a problem," 
she said. JON NALICK

GRAND JURY'S REPORT CALLING FOR NEW JAILS IS LABELED UNREALISTIC; FACILITIES: 
COUNTY ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER SAYS THE MONEY ISN'T AVAILABLE TO EITHER BUILD OR 
OPERATE PROPOSED DETENTION SITES IN IRVINE AND SANTA ANA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County officials said Wednesday that a grand jury report recommending 
construction of jails in Irvine and Santa Ana is unrealistic because the county 
has no way to pay for the proposed facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the money to build or operate a new jail," County 
Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said. "There's no sense getting a lot of 
people upset in Santa Ana and Irvine until we have the funding in place. Why 
create all this agitation?" 
</P>
<P>
 In a five-page report released this week, the grand jury recommended that the 
county build a 3,000-bed, maximum- to medium-security jail next to the 
sheriff's headquarters at Flower Street and Santa Ana Boulevard in Santa Ana. 
The county also should build another 3,000-bed, maximum- to medium-security 
facility on 100 acres next to the James A. Musick Branch Jail in Irvine, the 
grand jury report stated. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also suggested that the Board of Supervisors consider imposing a 
tax on county residents or sell bonds specifically earmarked for new jail 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is the county has to do something," said Royal Lord, a grand 
jury member. "You can keep releasing crooks onto the streets or put them in 
jail. Either way the county is still going to pay." 
</P>
<P>
 Although county officials agree there is an overcrowding crisis in the jails, 
they say the county does not have the money to build new facilities and 
residents have been unwilling to pay for new jails. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amount of money we're talking about is staggering," Supervisor Gaddi H. 
Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez said he thought the grand jury report failed to thoroughly analyze how 
much it costs to build and operate a jail. He pointed out that an attempt to 
get voter approval of a tax for jail construction failed by a large margin 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Vasquez said, there are various land-use and environmental issues 
that would have to be addressed before either of the two proposed sites could 
be approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Lord said the panel reached its findings after months of research, which 
included interviewing federal and county law enforcement authorities, touring 
other jails and possible jail sites and examining the sheriff's reports on jail 
overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
 Board Chairman Thomas F. Riley, whose district includes the Irvine site, said 
any discussion on where to build a jail always sparks tremendous concern among 
county residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 'not in my back yard' syndrome has prevailed here," Riley said. "But we 
have to come up with a place. We can't keep saying no." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley added that he hoped the grand jury would add "some credibility" to the 
overcrowding crisis and possibly spur the board into action before the end of 
the year, when he and Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder retire. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley said he thought the current board could take some political pressure off 
the two new supervisors, state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) and 
Huntington Beach Councilman Jim Silva, who will be sworn on to the board in 
January, by addressing the jail issue before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that would be in the best interest of incoming supervisors," Riley 
said. "I'm prepared to vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley, however, declined to state his position on the proposed sites and said 
he doubted that the board would be able to act on the issue at its meeting 
Tuesday, as recommended in the grand jury report. 
</P>
<P>
 Jail overcrowding has plagued the county for more than 15 years, getting 
increasingly worse each year. County officials say the situation has become 
even more critical this year with the state's "three strikes" law. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Brad Gates told county officials in August that the problem has become 
so severe that in the past two years he has been forced to release nearly 
55,000 inmates from jail early. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the crisis, little has been done at the county level, with the 
exception of a proposed expansion of the Theo Lacy Branch Jail in Orange. That 
project, which would increase the number of jail beds at the facility from 
1,326 to 4,480, is on hold, pending negotiations between the county and the 
city to resolve the city's opposition to expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner said the grand jury's report was "very timely" 
because it assures officials with the city of Orange that they are not the only 
ones who should be burdened with new jail bed construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange has to be convinced that it is not the only game in town," Steiner 
said. "If some of these other communities could pick up some of the burden, 
Orange is willing to do its part."

DRUG LAB MAY BE CULPRIT IN HOTEL FIRE 
</P>

<P>
 Police, fire and hazardous-materials investigators said that a fire on the 
fifth floor of the Holiday Inn on Wednesday might have been caused by a drug 
lab in one of the rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a possibility that there might have been a meth lab," said Irvine 
Police Lt. Vic Thies."We're looking into that right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was reported just after 6:30 p.m., according to an Orange County Fire 
dispatcher, and was slowed by the hotel's sprinkler system. No one was injured, 
but water caused extensive damage to the floors below, fire officials said. 
About 15 fire units responded to the hotel in the 17900 block of Von Karman 
Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 Police evacuated the fifth floor until HAZMAT investigators could check the 
air quality, police said.

TRANSPLANT COUPLE HOME FROM HOSPITAL; HEALTH: HUSBAND WHO NEEDED KIDNEY AND NEW 
WIFE WHO DONATED IT BOTH HEALING, LOOKING FORWARD TO A LONG LIFE TOGETHER.

<P>
 A pair of Orange County newlyweds whose story drew national attention returned 
home Wednesday, with the bride having given her left kidney to the groom in 
hopes of arresting his condition as a gravely ill diabetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel great," said Randall Curlee. "It's such a relief. I don't know how to 
put it into words. What do you say to someone who's saved your life? You just 
say that you love them very much." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going home -- to rest, to pet my dog, to get organized," said Victoria 
Ingram-Curlee, whose kidney was removed and transplanted into Curlee on Nov. 9. 
"I think other (potential donors) should open their eyes to making this happen 
for someone they love. It's a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram-Curlee became the 350th American to have donated a kidney to a spouse, 
according to the United Network of Organ Sharing. Surgeons found it remarkable 
that she proved to be a candidate at all, but initial tests showed her kidneys 
an almost-perfect match with Curlee's. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's story first got national attention when the two exchanged vows in 
a televised ceremony in the hospital chapel in mid-October, and got further 
attention when a mishap occurred in the operating room the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 An invasive radiologist, conducting a routine arteriogram of Ingram-Curlee's 
left kidney, nicked one of three arteries leading to the lower pole of the 
organ, delaying the operation almost a month. But immediately after the mishap, 
it was feared her status as a donor had been irrevocably compromised. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequent tests indicated no lasting damage, but instead of removing her 
right kidney, which surgeons planned to do in the first place, they chose to 
transplant her left, thus leaving her with the better of the two. The damaged 
artery was then repaired before the kidney was sewn into Curlee's pelvis. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors said Wednesday that husband and wife are healing properly and that 
Curlee, 46, should enjoy a much longer, happier life because of his 45-year-old 
bride's generosity. 
</P>
<P>
 Curlee's diabetes has caused him to suffer a heart attack and problems with 
his vision, as well as having to take insulin twice daily. Had he not had the 
transplant soon, doctors said dialysis would have been imperative. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just elated," said Dr. Robert Mendez, director of the surgical 
transplant program at Sharp Memorial Hospital in San Diego, where he performed 
the operation. "You're looking at two wonderfully healthy young people." 
</P>
<P>
 "We can look forward to being around together for years," said Curlee, who 
added that he hopes to return to work -- albeit from his home computer -- as a 
marketing representative for a Costa Mesa audio company. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief rest, his wife hopes to resume her duties as a real estate agent 
in Mission Viejo, where the couple recently occupied a new home.

CHARLES ALLEGEDLY CONFESSED ROLE IN SLAYINGS TO A FRIEND, AFFIDAVIT SAYS; 
CRIME: THE DOCUMENT FOCUSES ON INCONSISTENCIES IN THE MURDER SUSPECT'S 
STATEMENTS TO POLICE, AND CONTRADICTORY ONES GIVEN BY OTHERS AFTER THE 
KILLINGS.

 Murder suspect Edward Charles III called a friend the day after his parents 
and younger brother were found dead in a burning car and confessed tearfully 
that he had killed them, according to a police affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I did something terrible," Charles allegedly told the friend on the 
afternoon of Nov. 8. "I think I killed my family." 
</P>
<P>
 His alleged confession is mentioned in a 13-page affidavit that Los Angeles 
County sheriff's detectives gave to the court in seeking a search warrant for 
the Fullerton home that Charles shared with his parents, Edward and Dolores 
Charles, and brother Danny Charles, a performer and USC student. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies of the three were discovered stuffed in a family car that had been 
doused with gasoline and set afire outside a La Mirada high school Nov. 7. 
Charles, who was arrested two days later, was charged Monday with three counts 
of murder with special circumstances, which could mean a death penalty if he is 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 The affidavit, filed in court records, focused on inconsistencies in Charles' 
statements to police, and contradictory statements given by others after the 
murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Charles told police he was at his fiancee's home watching television 
when the burning Honda was spotted, the latter's brother said Charles called 
him around that time asking for a ride home from a park about half a mile from 
the fire, according to the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
 The police document also said Charles changed his story about where he spent 
the night of Nov. 6 -- the time that authorities believe the family was 
murdered. Charles was seen at his family's house early the next morning wiping 
the driveway with a rag, according to the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
 The search warrant said authorities were looking for a hammer and knife 
believed to be the murder weapons. Autopsies determined that Charles' father 
and younger brother were bludgeoned, and that Danny Charles, who was found 
unburned in the trunk, was also stabbed and strangled. Dolores Charles had 
bruises on her throat, but the cause of death was not known because her body 
was so badly burned. Investigators have said no weapons had been found. 
</P>
<P>
 During the alleged telephone conversation, Charles repeated the confession 
when his friend did not believe him, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The friend wasn't believing him and (Charles) said, 'It's all over the 
television.' And he hung up," Sheriff's Detective Ron Lancaster said in an 
interview. The friend, who was not identified in the affidavit, called police. 
Authorities tried to meet with Charles that night but could not find him, 
according to the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster said authorities believe the friend is the only person to whom 
Charles allegedly has confessed. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles has steadfastly maintained his innocence to authorities, and his 
defense lawyer denied that his client had confessed to anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely false. . . . There was no statement whatsoever to anybody," 
said Deputy Public Defender Ronald E. Klar, who was assigned to the case 
Wednesday. "A man does not confess to crimes he's not guilty of." 
</P>
<P>
 Klar said he had not seen the affidavit and had received only scant police 
reports so far. He declined to reveal Charles' defense strategy, except to say 
that he would attack claims of a confession in court. Arraignment is scheduled 
Nov. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Klar said he spoke with Charles on Wednesday and described him as "saddened 
and a little depressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles' fiancee, Tiffany Bowen, declined to comment Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor in the case, Deputy Dist. Atty. David Brent, said the 
allegation of a confession strengthens a case he believes is already strong. 
</P>
<P>
 "That statement, in my mind, is not necessary to prove guilt," he said. "It 
really is something additional that makes the case better. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to have a statement from a defendant admitting participation in 
crimes, even at an early stage," he continued. "The public is confident that 
the police have got the right man. . . . There are no lingering doubts." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles initially told investigators he spent the night of Nov. 6 at the Bowen 
home in Fullerton, but when the Bowens disputed that, he said he had been at 
his family's home that night, according to the affidavit. On the night of the 
fire, he said, he went to Bowen's home, where he has lived off and on in recent 
months, and never left after 8 p.m. But Bowen's brother, Richard, later told 
detectives he had given Charles a ride about 9:15 p.m. to the service station 
where Charles worked as a mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the affidavit, Richard Bowen said Charles called shortly after 10 
p.m. asking for a ride home from a park a little more than half a mile from the 
La Mirada school where the car was found burning shortly before. 
</P>
<P>
 The affidavit also said Charles was seen the night of the murder driving a car 
that matched the description of the Honda that burned. Minutes before he was 
seen in the car, a neighbor had reported hearing a man's voice crying for help 
from the trunk of a car with a similar description near the family's home. 
According to the affidavit, Charles told police the car he was driving that 
night belonged to the Bowens, though the family owns no such car.

 There's one thing snowboarders do not want to look like: skiers. Not for 
snowboarders are the tight stretch pants or Ivana Trump parkas seen on the 
Aspen ski set. This is a younger, more rebellious crowd that likes to cut new 
paths not only on the slopes but on the fashion front. 
</P>
<P>
 Snowboarders have long preferred apparel with a strong street influence -- 
oversize pants, plaid flannel pullovers and cartoonish stocking hats and 
beanies. These days the clothes are less baggy (all that fabric just got in the 
way), but they still have more of a loose-fitting street/skate look than a 
svelte ski silhouette. 
</P>
<P>
 For winter 1994-95, a lot of snowboard apparel looks like it came from a 
vintage shop or thrift store. The jackets are a takeoff on bowling shirts and 
gas station attendant uniforms, with contrasting stripes and panels in classic 
'50s and '60s colors, like burnt orange and brown. Instead of stretch pants, 
snowboarders are opting for roomy work pants with fixed waistbands made of 
weather-proof nylon. 
</P>
<P>
 Spare, one of a dozen or so small snowboard apparel manufacturers that have 
recently sprung up in Orange County, designed a jacket it calls "The Kramer" 
after the "Seinfeld" character who regularly sports vintage shirts. It's a 
nylon jacket that comes in retro hues with wide stripes down the front (about 
$100). Spare also introduced a no-frills zip-front jacket styled after a gas 
station attendant's uniform, available in solid orange, brown, khaki or pale 
blue nylon ($84). 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids want to wear something that's cool. They want to snowboard but have the 
same look as skateboarders," says Shane La Voie, co-owner of Capital 
Distribution in San Juan Capistrano, which produces Spare and a new snowboard 
apparel line called Blond. Both lines are carried at Laguna Surf & Sport, 
Surfside Sports in Newport Beach and Killer Dana in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Snowboarders want to look different but not flashy and stupid," La Voie says. 
"They want to be respected." 
</P>
<P>
 Blond offers letterman's jackets and polo shirts out of waterproof nylon in 
colors like olive, caramel and brown, as well as work pants in brown, olive, 
gray and black (about $80-$100). One pullover comes in brown nylon with a 
'50s-inspired argyle knit collar ($95). 
</P>
<P>
 "The guiding principle of snowboard clothing is to look as different as 
possible from skiers. If skiers wear tight, Day-Glo outfits, then snowboarders 
will wear dark, loose clothes," says Bill Sharp, marketing director for Burning 
Snow, a Newport Beach-based snowboard apparel maker. 
</P>
<P>
 Burning Snow's styles have a strong work ethic: There's a quilted nylon jacket 
that looks like a button-down work shirt in solid black, navy or gray (about 
$85), quilted work pants ($80) and nylon pullovers in burnt orange, mustard, 
olive, black or navy with a plaid flannel hood (about $150). The line is 
carried at Surfside Sports, Newport Ski Co. in Newport Beach and Orange and 
Inflight Surf & Sport in Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 As snowboarding grows in popularity, the clothes, like the sport itself, have 
become more sophisticated. Snowboarders realize that, while they don't want to 
look like skiers, neither do they want to get wet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Snowboarders got too cold and too wet for too long," says Pam Hunzicker, head 
apparel buyer for Chick's Sporting Goods in Tustin and Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Now snowboard apparel manufacturers such as Burton, an industry leader, are 
offering the same kind of waterproof, breathable, high-tech pants and shells 
worn by skiers. Some jackets have vents that zip open to cool down the body, 
wicking material that keeps the body dry, and reinforced knees and seats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Companies used to make stuff that was waterproof but not breathable or stuff 
that was as stiff as piece of armor," says Duke Edukas, co-owner of Surfside 
Sports in Newport Beach. "Now you have cutting-edge fashions, but they're 
functional, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Surfside's most high-tech garment is a jacket by Burton with vents, closed 
seams, detachable hood and virtually every other conceivable feature for 
weathering severe conditions ($269). 
</P>
<P>
 Yet when heading for such local slopes as Big Bear, where conditions are 
milder than they are at Mammoth, Orange County snowboarders typically forgo the 
high-tech jackets and keep warm by layering pieces. They wear pullover shells 
or full-zip jackets over sweat shirts and wool sweaters over thermal underwear. 
</P>
<P>
 While snowboard apparel is geared mainly toward guys, the growing number of 
women entering the sport has caused apparel manufacturers to take notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone are the days when female snowboarders had to wear the men's clothes in 
size Extra Small. Now there are lines such as Cold as Ice in Costa Mesa, 
Bombshell and Hard Pack making snowboarding apparel just for women. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd been snowboarding for eight years and didn't want to wear the guys' stuff 
anymore," says Darcy Lee, owner of Cold as Ice. She created her line that 
includes "girlie" looks such as fleece-lined nylon parkas and stirrup pants, 
some in photographic floral prints (available at Chick's and Newport Ski Co. 
for about $160 to $200).

FASHION; AN AMERICAN IN PARIS RESTYLES AN ICON; IT'S BEEN REVERSE CULTURE SHOCK 
SINCE JOAN JULIET BUCK TOOK OVER FRENCH VOGUE. IT'S A WHOLE NEW LOOK THAT'S 
TURNING HEADS FROM THE CHAMPS-ELYSEES TO THE STREETS OF L.A. 
</P>

<P>
 When Los Angeles-born Joan Juliet Buck arrived here in June to take over 
French Vogue, there was bound to be some French resistance. The worst of it 
came from, of all places, her hair salon. 
</P>
<P>
 Being the editor in chief of France's most prestigious fashion publication 
means maintaining a certain discipline in one's everyday life, Buck ruefully 
acknowledges: "It's all hair and makeup and high heels. And no more Minnie 
Mouse shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 Minnie Mouse shoes? 
</P>
<P>
 "Chunky, high heel, flamenco-type shoes," she explains. "I thought it would be 
safe one Saturday morning to wear them to the hairdresser. Well, they fell down 
laughing. . . . Anywhere else on Earth you can wear The Wrong Shoes and get 
away with it. Here, they snub you." 
</P>
<P>
 But this was not Buck's only shoe incident, she confesses. Fueled with 
cigarettes and coffee after lunch at the Cafe Flore, she launches into a story 
about the time she and her French boyfriend were touring a museum. Halfway 
through the visit, he noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was wearing a pair of very dirty sneakers," Buck says. "He distanced 
himself for the rest of the visit, and then made me go home and change shoes 
before lunch. The French man keeps French women up to standard." 
</P>
<P>
 But we digress. 
</P>
<P>
 Buck was sent here with a mission. French Vogue has been in a slump for 
several years -- reportedly losing money since 1991 with sagging advertising 
revenues, a stodgy and rather pretentious editorial attitude, and a dwindling 
circulation of 80,000. (American Vogue, in contrast, has a circulation of 1.2 
million.) 
</P>
<P>
 French Vogue's Los Angeles audience consists of hard-core fashion types who 
think nothing of forking over $10 for one issue -- even though they might not 
be able to decipher the text. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get it for the fashions you can't get in American magazines, and for 
creative ideas," says stylist Pat Naderhoff, who designs wardrobes for music 
videos and commercials. "The French seem to stay a little more in tune. They 
seem to find the new designers first." 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. hair and makeup artist Collier Strong also looks to the French for 
inspiration and ideas. "They are so far ahead of American magazines." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Buck, who most recently worked as the New York-based movie critic for American 
Vogue, was recruited by parent company Conde Nast to make the magazine viable. 
</P>
<P>
 "French Vogue has always meant snobbery, high society, a completely worn-out 
image. My mission is to make this magazine a necessary entertainment," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Petty hairdressers aside, it is the American who is inflicting culture shock 
on the French. Buck didn't waste any time on her magazine's make-over. 
</P>
<P>
 She banned the proverbial shot of The Girl in the Hotel Bedroom because, "What 
the hell is she doing there?" 
</P>
<P>
 S & M and girls kissing were also out. 
</P>
<P>
 And au revoir to "beaten children waify things with (breasts) hanging, the sad 
Lolita thing." 
</P>
<P>
 And artsy out-of-focus pictures. "Vogue was out of focus for about eight 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 She cannot resist adding, with a steely smile, "I'm iffy on garter belts." 
</P>
<P>
 Her first issue in September was billed as an "homage to the French woman." 
</P>
<P>
 "September newsstand sales were up 20% from last year, October was up 29%," 
reports Jonathan Newhouse, president of Conde Nast in Europe. "I'd say it's an 
extremely good performance." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What is the Buck imprint? "I really believe everything should be fun," she 
says. "Jung said if you aren't connected to a sense of play, it just ain't 
gonna happen." 
</P>
<P>
 She poses the next question herself: "Am I making it more American? Certain 
things about American journalism are unbeatable. Like a sense of clarity in 
writing and photography." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Buck never forgets the French half of French Vogue -- the 
part, for example, that treats fashion "as a natural thing, a given, rather 
than the how-to language of American fashion magazines," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Los Angeles 45 years ago, Buck moved to Europe at age 3 and speaks, 
writes and even thinks in fluent French, thanks to a peripatetic childhood as 
the daughter of a movie producer who shuttled among Paris, London and 
Hollywood. Summer vacations were spent at the Ireland home of her godfather, 
director John Huston. 
</P>
<P>
 Her first job after dropping out of Sarah Lawrence College in 1968 was as a 
fashion photography stylist. She has since worked as a writer or editor for 
British Vogue, Vanity Fair, Conde Nast Traveler and Women's Wear Daily, among 
other publications. Along the way, she has also written two novels and five 
screenplays. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading fashion magazines as a teen-ager inspired dreams of "drama, mystery, 
elegance and that extra unattainable thing." A great magazine, she reasons, 
"should be a place you can't quite reach, a place you want to be in." 
</P>
<P>
 Do French women want that in a magazine too? 
</P>
<P>
 "All they want is a little black sweater," she deadpans. "But it has to be the 
right sweater," she says. (This season, it has to be a Prada.) 
</P>
<P>
 "French women are marvelous because French women tend to dress to attract men. 
An American woman will wear a rather too long skirt and flat shoes because it's 
comfortable, and because she thinks it has something to do with Newport 
(R.I.)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This leads to another digression on whether the French woman carries a gene 
for chic. 
</P>
<P>
 "American rigor is about clean hair. French rigor is about the right skirt," 
Buck offers. And while American fashion editors might talk about a line of 
clothes as having "a good weekend feeling," for example, a French fashion 
editor will say, "Look where the jacket stops. It's form over function." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Buck adds unhelpfully, "It might be in the little chocolate bar 
inside the pain au chocolat. " 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles women have a particular style all their own. "I haven't been to 
California since the 5.6 (earthquake)," Buck says, "but I always think of Los 
Angeles as the Long Beige Linen Skirt." 
</P>
<P>
 Buck may think in terms of clothes, but she holds her magazine to a higher 
standard. "If it's just clothes, fashion is a catalogue," she says. "It has to 
have a dream factor. A fashion show that is really exciting presents costumes 
for a more interesting life."

A DEFIANT VOICE; CARL ROWAN HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF TRYING TO DESTROY THE NAACP. 
BUT THE COLUMNIST SAYSHE IS ONLY AFTER CHANGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FULWOOD III, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you've ever heard that soothing voice or read those scholarly sentences, 
you'd know it's him. Syndicated columnist Carl Rowan has a signature style. 
</P>
<P>
 That jowly baby face and genial manner have been fixtures among the talking 
heads on PBS' "Inside Washington" since 1965. His voice can be heard on 25 
major-market radio stations broadcasting "The Rowan Reports," a daily radio 
commentary. He has written seven books, some of them bestsellers. 
</P>
<P>
 But lately, Rowan, an elegant and polished black man of 69 years who writes 
and speaks in the terse and precise prose common among the well-educated of his 
generation, has become something of an attack journalist on a self-appointed 
mission to bring down the current leadership of the NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
 His bitterly critical columns, distributed by the King Features Syndicate and 
published in 100 newspapers across the land, are the major reason the National 
Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People is facing its greatest crisis. 
NAACP Executive Director Benjamin F. Chavis was forced to resign late in the 
summer amid allegations first raised by Rowan -- that he used the 
organization's money to settle a sexual discrimination suit brought by a former 
employee, opening the organization's financial practices to unprecedented 
public scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Rowan's current target is NAACP Board Chairman William Gibson, who had been 
Chavis' most ardent supporter. By repeatedly demanding that Gibson resign, 
Rowan has set himself apart from most mainstream reporters -- black or white -- 
who tend to steer clear of pointed and determined criticism of the NAACP. But 
Rowan relishes the combat of writing to incite change -- regardless, he said, 
of whether his targets are white-led government institutions, such as the FBI 
under former director J. Edgar Hoover in the 1960s, or the current NAACP 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 During a wide-ranging interview conducted recently in the living room of his 
rambling northwest Washington home, Rowan defended his hard-edged columns. He 
called them "a service," written with the intention of educating the public and 
instigating reforms within an organization he views as necessary to the 
interests of African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Rowan rejected the argument that he is bent on destroying the NAACP. In fact, 
he says, the organization absolutely has a role in the post-civil rights 
generation. "Take this (recent mid-term) election. The NAACP in a good and 
normal time would have been out there for weeks trying to get blacks out to 
vote," he said. "They have been virtually paralyzed by all their money troubles 
and could only do a little trifling stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Once Gibson is out of office, Rowan said, and a new management team is in 
place, he will use his column to urge supporters to send money back into the 
NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a group preparing for the moment when (Gibson) steps down so they 
can say to the nation, as I will say, 'The time has come to rush to the rescue 
to the support of this organization because the United States would be a lesser 
place without an NAACP,' " Rowan said. "But no way will I ask anybody to give a 
nickel as long as (Gibson) is there at the head of the NAACP because I know the 
extent to which the meager funds of the NAACP have been abused." 
</P>
<P>
 Rowan also brushed aside suggestions he was an "Uncle Tom" or tool of the 
mainstream media, noting his 43 years as a Life Member of the NAACP. Among the 
highlights: Rowan "worked closely with (then NAACP attorney) Thurgood Marshall 
in the days way before Brown v. Board of Education." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For much of his life, Rowan has been defiantly confronting conventions of the 
day. He was one of the nation's first blacks to be a commissioned officer in 
the U.S. Navy, which enabled him to graduate from Oberlin College and to earn a 
master's degree in journalism from the University of Minnesota on the G.I. 
Bill. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked briefly at the Baltimore Afro-American, a black-owned newspaper, but 
left to become a copy editor at the Minneapolis Tribune and one of the few 
blacks working within the white press in the late 1940s. His reporting on race 
relations in the segregated South during the 1950s brought him fame and 
recognition, as well as close associations with such civil rights leaders as 
former NAACP General Secretary Roy Wilkins, Urban League President Whitney 
Young and Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1961, seeking to integrate the all-white diplomatic corps, President John 
F. Kennedy appointed Rowan to be deputy secretary of state. Later, Kennedy 
tapped him as a U.N. delegate during the Cuban missile crisis and ambassador to 
Finland. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Lyndon Johnson Administration, Rowan sat in on Cabinet and National 
Security Council meetings as director of the United States Information Agency. 
In that capacity, Rowan was privy to secret FBI documents on the activities of 
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., an issue that some within the NAACP have 
pointed to as proof of Rowan's cozy ties to Hoover and his passion for 
attacking the civil rights leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just hogwash," Rowan said. "Everybody in the world knows J. Edgar 
Hoover hated my guts and he made it known with a passion." 
</P>
<P>
 In his 1991 autobiography, "Breaking Barriers," Rowan made it clear he felt 
the same about Hoover. "The FBI director had turned his powerful agency into a 
ruthless foe of blacks and the civil rights movement because Hoover hated the 
idea of black equality and because King had dared to criticize him," Rowan 
wrote. "I knew that Hoover's hatred of this most articulate, most inspiring of 
all the civil rights leaders, and King's apparent vulnerability to Hoover's 
assaults, jeopardized not just my USIA budget but the whole campaign for civil 
rights and black equality." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about his relationship with Hoover and King, Rowan admitted to 
having "one disagreement" with King concerning the minister's sermons against 
the Vietnam War, which angered Johnson. "We were close friends," he said of 
King. "I tried to warn him about the things Hoover and the FBI were doing. 
President Johnson gave me permission to inform King about wiretaps and smear 
tactics used by Hoover, and I tried to persuade King to watch what he did and 
with whom he did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rowan said his fight with Gibson and the NAACP board pale in comparison to his 
battles with Hoover. "The Hoover business was more vociferous than this," he 
said. "But I felt just as secure then as I do now because I know what I'm 
writing is right and eventually it will all come out in the public." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But why is Carl Rowan airing the NAACP's dirty linen now? 
</P>
<P>
 "The time comes when you know that silence in the face of arrogant destruction 
makes you guilty to a great degree," Rowan said. "I have no agenda whatsoever 
for picking the next director or board chairman. But I do know they have got to 
reconstruct the board." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, he's won one battle toward that goal. 
</P>
<P>
 In an 801-word column released by the syndicate on Aug. 8, Rowan fired his 
opening shot. He wrote that he possessed documents suggesting an "adulterous 
relationship" between Chavis and a former employee, Mary E. Stansel. He also 
alleged the former executive director "used at least $64,000 of NAACP funds as 
initial 'hush' payments" to prevent her from filing suit against him and the 
NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
 That column scored a direct hit. Across the nation, in small towns and major 
urban areas, fax machines and grapevine gossip spewed word of Rowan's columns 
among NAACP members and supporters. Major newspapers such as the New York 
Times, the Baltimore Sun, the Wall Street Journal and the Los Angeles Times 
noticed as well, initiating their own probes into the NAACP's administrative 
and financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Rowan said he often sees his work slightly reworked or reproduced in 
newspapers without his byline. "That's all right because it's the service I'm 
providing," he said. "As far as I'm concerned that's a part of the job of 
getting the major media to focus on some of the things they would not 
necessarily focus on." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, the NAACP's troubles became a well-worked story. People were talking 
about Chavis' secret $332,000 settlement of a sexual harassment charge, about 
the NAACP's debts that were soaring into the millions of dollars. By late 
August, Chavis was history, forced out by the board of directors and bitterly 
complaining of unfair media attacks on his administration. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks following Chavis' firing, Rowan continued to pound away in this 
columns at Gibson. Citing unnamed sources and secretly obtained documents, 
Rowan wrote that Gibson "doubled dipped" thousands of dollars in expense 
reimbursements from the organization and used his NAACP-provided American 
Express card to live an elaborate lifestyle relative to most members of the 
civil rights group. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson, a Greenville, S.C., dentist, has denied Rowan's accusations.  
</P>
<P>
 Appearing last month at an NAACP South Carolina State Convention assembly in 
Florence, Gibson branded Rowan a "Judas Iscariot" and a "house nigger" to 
shouts of affirmation and support. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, that doesn't bother me," Rowan said, when asked about Gibson's comments. 
"I don't believe even a fraction of the blacks in this nation believe that. 
I've heard that all my professional life. My job is to tell the public things I 
think they ought to know and don't already know. If I see an injustice to 
African Americans, I feel it is my duty to tell the public about it. I make no 
apologies about that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Without question, Rowan has shaken public confidence in the NAACP's 
leadership, rattling its support, from the grass roots to its contributing 
foundations to its embattled executive suites. Grants from private corporations 
and philanthropic organizations have been curtailed pending an independent 
investigation into the NAACP's financial affairs. Money from local and state 
branches has stopped flowing into the national headquarters, forcing officials 
to furlough about 90 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Rowan said many of his sources have come to him after reading his columns in 
the State newspaper in Columbia, S.C., and the Baltimore Sun (Baltimore is home 
to the NAACP's national headquarters). Those papers have been important in 
generating new sources because NAACP members -- with knowledge of Gibson's 
activities in South Carolina and headquarters operations -- fax Rowan's stories 
to others across the nation and information to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is quite a network going on out there," Rowan said. "When members start 
asking questions, more and more people call me with information." 
</P>
<P>
 To prove his point, he rose from his living room chair to answer the telephone 
in another part of the house and returned a few minutes later, snaking fax 
paper behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is from the State newspaper in Columbia, S.C.," he said. "The State has 
written an editorial calling for Gibson to resign." 
</P>
<P>
 The largest newspaper in South Carolina had a lead editorial titled: "For the 
sake of the NAACP, Chairman Gibson must go." The editorial read: "Columnist 
Carl Rowan's accusations . . . is but one reason for his dismissal." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas N. McLean, editorial page editor at the State, said he has published 
every one of Rowan's seven columns attacking the NAACP since last summer. "I 
think Mr. Rowan's reporting is the basis of our decision here. . . . There 
wasn't much debate. Mr. Rowan's work has been pretty through and devastating." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the Baltimore Sun has run every one of Rowan's columns. But Barry 
Rascovar, editorial page director at the Sun, said the newspaper stopped short 
of calling for Gibson's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to be accused of trying to lop off the heads of every NAACP 
leader," Rascovar said. But, he added, "Carl Rowan is a known black columnist 
and the fact that he was reporting rather than columnizing gave him incredible 
credibility. A white columnist wouldn't have been given as much credibility." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For some critics of his work, however, Rowan's columns have no credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Carl Rowan is an absolute disgrace to the African American race," 
said Larry Carter, an NAACP board member from Des Moines, Iowa. "It seems like 
he's trying to take a short crawl back to the plantation. He's done the African 
American community an injustice." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Alexander Jr., who directs the NAACP's North Carolina State Conference 
and supports Gibson's leadership, said Rowan's columns create a buzz among 
NAACP members and reporters often before he has an opportunity to read them. 
</P>
<P>
 "He stirred the pot," Alexander said bitterly. "Every time the issues he 
raised came down from boiling to a simmer, he stirs the pot again so it comes 
to a boil again." 
</P>
<P>
 Hemphill Pride II, an attorney and former president of the NAACP branch in 
Columbia, S.C., is one of Rowan's supporters: 
</P>
<P>
 "Carl Rowan appears to be outraged about the shenanigans that have occurred at 
the NAACP under the watch of this generation of leaders." 
</P>
<P>
 Pride, a Life Member of the NAACP who is also filing legal challenges to 
obtain the financial records of the S.C. NAACP branches controlled by Gibson, 
said it took courage for Rowan to write about the NAACP in a critical fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one likes to criticize the NAACP because of the long and successful 
history of the organization," he said. "It's uncomfortable to air dirty laundry 
in public. But that's a sword that cuts both ways because if black leadership 
fails to be kept accountable, a lot of people will be taken advantage of in the 
process." 
</P>
<P>
 That's how Rowan sees it too. He said his columns provide a sense of 
empowerment to the rank-and-file membership of the NAACP to demand 
accountability from their leaders, even if it breaches the myth of maintaining 
racial solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Previously, black America hadn't paid much attention" to the inner workings 
of the NAACP and its board, Rowan said. "They didn't really know what was going 
on. I'm not the protector of anything. Eventually, I have to write the truth."

BY DESIGN; EIGHT IS ENOUGH; SPRING'S LEADING LOOKS

 Much to the disappointment of L.A. fashion acolytes, the season for wearing 
fall clothes is about as abbreviated as an Anna Sui shrunken T-shirt. Really, 
how comfortable is a fake fur or a mohair sweater on a 70-degree day? Clothes 
that work here are lightweight and pared down, the kind that American and 
European designers traditionally cook up for spring. 
</P>
<P>
 So, with bated breath, we watched over the past several weeks as designers 
here and abroad presetned their visions of What the Well-Dressed Woman Will 
Wear (Please!) next season. What we got was a view of fashion's collective 
unconscious at work, anointing a particular hemline, a favorite print, a shade 
of pink and a heretofore ignored erogenous zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like there was a manufacturer's run-over on snakeskin," muttered a 
photographer who, in one day, had snapped snakeskin shirts, snakeskin belts, 
snakeskin vests, snakeskin jackets and pretty horrific-looking snakeskin 
loafers. 
</P>
<P>
 We laughed but made a mental note to track down our very own snakeskin vest, 
skinny belt and knee-grazing skirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Because designers carry ideas from one season over to the next, strains of 
spring '95 can be found now. A Monday newspaper ad for Anne Klein's youthful 
A-Line collection, for example, featured a short-sleeved khaki sweater over a 
silk charmeuse slip skirt -- a look straight from the runway. Buying clothes 
that foreshadow next season's silhouette is the best insurance against ending 
up with an outdated wardrobe.DEBRA GENDEL

FAITH HILL: OFF TO AN 'AWESOME' START; POP BEAT: DURING HER FIRST YEAR, THE 
COUNTRY SINGER HAS ALREADY HAD TWO NO. 1 HITS. SHE PERFORMS WITH ALAN JACKSON 
TONIGHT IN ANAHEIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ask country singer Faith Hill whether she's ever been petrified during her 
dizzying ascent to stardom in the last year, and she starts rattling off a 
list. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first show I had with Reba; the first time I was on David Letterman; the 
CMA awards; the . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 But that same list leads her to conclude: "I've had a pretty awesome year. I 
don't think it could have been any better myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps not. The 27-year-old singer's debut album, "Take Me as I Am," released 
late last year, has yielded two No. 1 country hits. The first, "Wild One," 
stayed at that pinnacle four weeks, matching a record for a new female artist 
set by Connie Smith in 1964. The second single was her two-step remake of 
"Piece of My Heart," a tune last claimed by Janis Joplin in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 Her album has gone gold and appears on its way to reaching platinum soon. She 
was nominated for a Country Music Assn. Horizon Award, recognizing new talent. 
She's gotten to sing with George Jones and meet such other legends as Tammy 
Wynette and Loretta Lynn. She's toured with her vocal idol, Reba McEntire, as 
well as Brooks & Dunn, and is now on the road with Alan Jackson, with whom she 
appears at The Pond of Anaheim tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 If that weren't all nice enough, Hill was calling from a tour stop in Denver, 
having just had a day off in Aspen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pretty much coming from paradise, but we're excited to be coming out to 
Anaheim, though," she declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this woman diplomatic or what? 
</P>
<P>
 She's loving her tour with Jackson, who has penned a song for her that she 
plans to include on her sophomore album. She also loved touring with Brooks & 
Dunn, and certainly with McEntire. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was unbelievable for me. Can you imagine, getting to work with someone 
who was your hero? It was really a highlight of my career, by far." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It might seem a little strange for someone to be talking about her career 
highlights when she's been in the business for, what, a year? But like many a 
star, Hill worked at it for years before finding success. 
</P>
<P>
 She fell in love with music in church, growing up in Star, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know I wanted to be an entertainer as a career. I just know that I 
loved to sing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time she was in high school, she was singing at rodeos and other 
events. Then at 19, she moved to Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
 In many respects, Nashville is just a be-twanged version of Hollywood, where 
it seems every waiter and carhop is a star waiting to be discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of that there, but there are some just normal people there 
too," Hill asserted, with a laugh. "There are people who actually grew up in 
Nashville and just work there. But there are an awful lot of aspiring 
musicians, artists and songwriters in Nashville. It's the place of dreams, just 
like Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill found it hard for a would-be singer to land a day job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Employers didn't take you quite as seriously" if you were a musician, she 
said. "I didn't realize that at first. I went to several places for jobs and 
was turned away just for the fact of being honest and saying, 'Of course, I 
moved here to be a singer.'  
</P>
<P>
 "That quickly changed. When I went to apply for a receptionist position at 
Gary Morris' publishing company, I told them that I wasn't in Nashville to be a 
singer, just to go to school and work as a receptionist. And I got the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Though singer Morris wasn't instrumental in furthering her career, Hill 
remains grateful to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gave me a job for 3 1/2 years, and he gave me advice, and he didn't fire 
me when he did find out I'd come to Nashville for a singing career. To me, that 
kind of support is well needed as much as someone taking your tape to a record 
company." 
</P>
<P>
 She was also fortunate in befriending hit Nashville singer-songwriter Gary 
Burr (who currently has his name on three charting country singles). He hired 
her as a singer in his band and used her to record demos. When she got signed 
by Warner Bros., some of the songs Hill brought to her sessions were Burr's.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was basically responsible for getting me going in Nashville," Hill said. 
"He's the guy who heard me as a young teen-ager who had a lot of dreams. . . . 
He heard something there, I guess, and wanted to see what he could do to help 
me mature it and took me under his wing." 
</P>
<P>
 She hasn't been able to form as close a bond with the famous names she has 
worked with since, "simply because we're all working all the time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 When growing up, she said, her vision of country stardom came mostly from 
movies and awards shows. "I had these pictures of it as a life of party , just 
partying all the time and playing music 24 hours a day, and then a life of 
limousines and nice clothes. Some of that is true, but the reality is we work 
our butts off, and it's not all limousines and long, gorgeous dresses." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with performing, Hill says she takes an active hand in every aspect of 
her career, from the finances to the tour routing. She's not yet a millionaire, 
she says, and if she were, she probably wouldn't get to act like one for some 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything I've made this year has gone right back to the road, back into my 
organization. I don't have money to go spend like I'd want to, so I'm not at 
the point yet where I can go buy my mom and dad a new kitchen or my brother a 
new house or nothing like that, but I want to," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently she's been busy selecting songs for her second album. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm real excited about them. Hopefully you'll be able to hear a bit of 
maturity, just because I've got one album under my belt and have been on the 
road all year. I can't wait to go back in the studio." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the Jackson-penned tune, titled "I Can't Do That Anymore," there 
may be one of Hill's own songs on the album, though she isn't sure whether it 
will make the grade yet. She did co-write two of the songs on "Take Me as I 
Am." 
</P>
<P>
 Like a great many other contemporary artists, she's reliant on others to write 
the words she sings, and she's aware of that dependency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very thankful we have songwriters as good as we do, because that's my 
livelihood too," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Curiously, her countrified version of "Piece of My Heart" was recorded without 
her ever having heard the famed Joplin rendition. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you listen to my version I think that's real obvious," she said. "I was 
pitched that song on a demo tape, by someone who had recorded it country. I 
didn't even know another version existed. Isn't that hysterical?" 
</P>
<P>
 Though Hill is from a photogenic generation of young country stars who have 
all but crowded older country legends off the charts, Hill evinces a fitting 
respect for her elders. 
</P>
<P>
 "For people who are younger than I am who have aspirations of being an artist 
someday, I really wish they would have the opportunity to know George Jones and 
Tammy Wynette, Loretta Lynn, Merle Haggard and all the people we grew up 
listening to, and be familiar with that classic music we all grew up with," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The constant in country music through the decades, she feels is, "it's about 
real people, who experience real-life traumas and joys. It's about real-life 
American people." 
</P>
<P>
 It can be argued that the older generation of legendary hard-living country 
stars had more trauma and life experience to draw from than most of today's 
performers, to which Hill responded: "I could agree with that somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think there are people nowadays who are just as passionate about their 
music as Merle Haggard or Hank Williams, but maybe they view it from a 
different perspective than through the bottom of a bottle. You can't take 
anything away from Garth Brooks, George Strait or Alan Jackson, who are just as 
passionate about what they do.  
</P>
<P>
 "And these are different times. Even looking at rock 'n' roll, you don't see 
people acting like the Doors and Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix and all those 
people. There's only a few that still live that lifestyle, and there might be a 
few in country music that live that lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you know the way you have to work these days and as competitive as it is, 
you have to stay healthy or you won't be able to endure what you have to do on 
the road out here," she said. "It's a lot of work, and if you want to stay on 
top of things, you have to take care of yourself, just plain and simple." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's singing has often been compared to that of her hero, McEntire, but Hill 
doesn't necessarily hear that. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a really big influence on me, but I don't think I sound like her," 
she said. "I don't see a lot of comparison, unless you could say she's a really 
smart, hard-working woman who knows what is going on in her life, and I hope 
that's something somebody will be able to say about me in years to come." 
</P>
<P>
 What does Hill think sets her apart from the thousands of other young hopefuls 
still knocking on Nashville's door? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really know what makes me different than everybody else. That's a 
tough question," she said. "I only can tell you that I really love what I do 
and I've always wanted to do this as long as I can remember, and it's been a 
desire so strong that it has completely outweighed everything else in my life." 
</P>

WHY IS THE MOUSE SCURRYING ABOUT?; MOVIES: DISNEY EXECUTIVES CONCEDE THEY WANT 
TO CHANGE PERCEPTIONS ABOUT THE STUDIO BUT DENY THAT A 'SEISMIC SHIFT' IS 
TAKING PLACE. 
</P>

 What's come over Disney? 
</P>
<P>
 First, it publicly apologizes to Robin Williams. Then it shells out $6 million 
for Sharon Stone to star in "The Last Dance." And along the way it bids $3 
million for an unfinished novel called "The Horse Whisperer" for Robert Redford 
and nearly $2 million to acquire feature film rights to a series of graphic 
novels about Jack the Ripper. 
</P>
<P>
 This from a studio where penny-pinching and battling agents almost became an 
art form? This from a studio that became synonymous with low-budget 
high-concept movies? This from a studio actors often fled for higher pay and 
more artistic freedom? 
</P>
<P>
 It has now been three months since turbulence began at Disney with the 
rancorous departure of longtime studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg and the 
naming of producer Joe Roth -- the onetime movie head at 20th Century Fox -- as 
his successor. 
</P>
<P>
 In that time, Roth and his top filmmaking executive, David Hoberman, have 
engineered several big-money deals in an attempt to change the creative 
community's perception of Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Disney company had a persona to it that said, 'We're going to do business 
the way we want to, regardless of what the marketplace says,' " Roth said. "I 
would not call (what we are now doing) a seismic shift. We're going to do 
business the way we want. If we have to pay market price in order to do a 
particular piece of business, so be it." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Hoberman: "If someone wants to say we're loosening the purse strings and 
going crazy, I'd say that's not true. All we're doing is paying market price 
for things and trying to get some good material. Maybe we wouldn't have paid $3 
million for a book two years ago, but if we think there is a movie there, and 
there were four studios in the running for it, we'll go after it." 
</P>
<P>
 Some believe it is Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner who is behind the 
company's about-face on deals for A-level talent and material. Those sources 
question whether this aggressive new posture is Eisner's backdoor way of 
repudiating Katzenberg, who was known for his tightfisted, controlling ways 
with talent and filmmakers. Before he left, though, Katzenberg had already set 
on a course of making bigger films, after the studio suffered years of flops 
with formulaic comedies made for a price. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Roth stressed that Disney will still make its share of high-concept, modestly 
priced movies but noted that the studio will be cutting the number of films it 
releases. "Of those," he said, "there will probably be a higher proportion that 
will be packaged in more high-profile way." 
</P>
<P>
 In a wide-ranging interview, Roth and Hoberman both said that they do not see 
"seismic" changes in store for the studio under their leadership, and they 
insisted that the upheaval that followed Katzenberg's departure is beginning to 
subside. 
</P>
<P>
 "October was better than September," Roth said, "and November is better than 
October." 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank God," chimed in Hoberman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's now: 'Let's get down to the job,' " Roth added. 
</P>
<P>
 But insiders say the Disney lot in Burbank is still trembling from the 
aftershocks, which could reverberate for some months to come. 
</P>
<P>
 The tension there has yet to subside. Some Katzenberg devotees are said to be 
restless. After initially being told by Roth that they could get out of their 
contracts early, they discovered that Disney would not let them leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think because Jeffrey was so involved with so many people at the company, 
there probably is some restlessness going on," said one filmmaker on the lot. 
"But I also think it's probably wise for the company to say everyone is staying 
put. . . . However, you'll likely see some movement over the next six months to 
a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the matter of clashing egos. Only last spring, Hoberman, then 
president of Touchstone Pictures, was promoted by Katzenberg to president of 
motion pictures, overseeing all three Disney divisions. His power and prestige 
were enhanced enormously. Today, the question is how long he'll remain now that 
the spotlight is shining on Roth. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was massively screwed over," one Disney insider said of Hoberman. "He was 
given the keys to the kingdom and then had the rug pulled out from under him. 
David is determined to keep his image in this town. He wants to keep the 
perception of power." 
</P>
<P>
 Some say Hoberman is biding his time, waiting for the right high-profile job 
to open up elsewhere. Until then, Disney has no plans to jettison him, because 
his contract is so lucrative.

 "Disney is not going to buy out Hoberman's contract," one insider said. "It's 
a five-year deal, and with stock, probably worth $2 million a year. That's a 
$10-million buyout. Unless he decides to leave, everybody is going to be 
playing happy happy." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In their joint interview, Roth and Hoberman tried to dispel rumors that they 
can't work together and that Hoberman secretly chafes under Roth's supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth said he has given Hoberman increased responsibilities in marketing and 
distribution while Roth's job has expanded from supervision of live-action 
films to include that of the marketing and distribution of Disney's animated 
movies, the company's live theater endeavors, its record company (Hollywood 
Records) and oversight of Miramax Films. 
</P>
<P>
 As for how he and Hoberman interact, Roth explained: "There are overlapping 
responsibilities. We're partners. David is exclusively responsible for getting 
all those raw materials together, and then we are partners in what movies are 
actually going to get made. He is doing all of that. I'm doing a piece of it. 
On the other side, I am in charge of the business of the company." 
</P>
<P>
 As to who actually greenlights Disney movies these days, Roth replied: "It's 
not really clean," but he noted that he and Hoberman collaborate on which 
pictures to make, whom to make them with and how big the budgets will be before 
any decision is reached. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, Dave and I are in the middle of the first campaign that we're 
working on together -- 'The Santa Clause,' " Roth said. The film, starring TV's 
Tim Allen, debuted with $19 million at the box office last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is Roth himself. Some say he seems overwhelmed by the 
responsibilities of running a studio as huge as Disney. He himself likens it to 
"trying to catch up to a speeding train." 
</P>
<P>
 Some have noticed that under Roth, the studio has become "very 
compartmentalized." 
</P>
<P>
 "There used to be open access to Jeffrey under the old structure," one source 
said. "Now, the middle ranks and even some of the upper-middle ranks of 
executives do not have a tremendous amount of interaction with Roth. I imagine 
that's David's desire. He wants to preserve whatever possible dignity he can."

 Perhaps taking a cue from the wineries that commission artists to design their 
labels, Perrier is putting arty stuff on its mineral water during the holidays. 
The labels, attached to the bottle by an advanced shrink-wrap technology, show 
people drinking water, ice skating and cavorting in fairly funky styles that 
perhaps clash a bit with Perrier's classic Art Deco (all except Mr. Lime in his 
coat and tie), but Perrier is serious about this -- there's a nationwide search 
on for young artists to design next year's holiday bottles. In supermarkets 
this month, restaurants in December. Eeoo. Yucko. I'll Have Some More, Though.

A TURKEY WINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 L e Beaujolais Nouveau was invented in France, but it may be the best single 
match for the Thanksgiving table. 
</P>
<P>
 It is my personal choice since its forward fruit flavors work well with 
candied yams, sage dressing, raisins, cranberry sauce and mashed potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 If a white wine is preferred, an off-dry Gewurztraminer is a fine alternative, 
but bone-dry red wines are a tough match because of the sweet dishes we 
generally have at the traditional Thanksgiving table. 
</P>
<P>
 In red wine, after Beaujolais, only Zinfandel can hope to compete with the 
flavors and then I'd pick one loaded with richness. Zinfandel's raspberry-ish 
aroma works with some of the Thanksgiving meal, but it can also be astringent, 
a tough match for sweeter foods. 
</P>
<P>
 Gamay Beaujolais -- though made from a different grape -- has the cherry and 
strawberry flavors and the softness and quaffability of true Beaujolais, making 
it far more widely appealing than tart, tannic young red wine. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're into Cabernet and must have it with your turkey, be forewarned: Its 
flavors are obliterated by cranberry sauce and yams. DAN BERGER

WINE: THE SHOCK OF THE NOUVEAU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Probably the silliest but most vigorous ritual in the wine world is the race 
to market with the first wine of the year, Beaujolais Nouveau. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called vin de l'annee is the result of a swift harvest of the Gamay 
Noir grapes, a rapid fermentation, a hasty bottling and then a brief wait until 
the moment when it's legal to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Union Interprofessional des Vins de Beaujolais (UIVB), governing body 
for the area, formally recognized Nouveau Beaujolais in 1951, it settled on 
midnight, Nov. 15 as the date on which it's legal to sell the young wine. In 
1985 the date was changed to the third Thursday in November. 
</P>
<P>
 That, of course is today. And thanks to the difference in time zones, 12:01 
a.m. Beaujolais time is 3:01 p.m. on Wednesday West Coast time. Therefore, the 
French Embassy here decreed that bottles could be opened then -- about the same 
time some Paris cafes were pulling the corks on the 1994 wine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before 1951, nouveau Beaujolais was just a local tradition -- wine made fast 
to consume (often while still fermenting) while the more serious Cru Beaujolais 
was being made. The local popularity leaked out to cafes in Lyon, and by 1951 
was being demanded by Parisians. 
</P>
<P>
 The burghers of Beaujolais, not about to miss a trick, began to deliver the 
wine to market in all manner of ways -- horse-drawn carts, balloonists, 
helicopters, elephants, you name it. 
</P>
<P>
 When the New World got wind of the popularity of nouveau in the 1970s, the 
race to deliver nouveau went supersonic -- some wine was even flown in on the 
Concorde. Wherever it went, importers had to agree in writing not to sell 
bottles before midnight preceding the third Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 That such fuss should be accorded this simplest of wines is galling to some 
connoisseurs, who decry the entire ballyhooing scene of the third Thursday. But 
merchants and restaurateurs, on the European continent and here, love this day 
because it's the one day when wine, no matter how modest it is, grabs center 
stage worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs come out weeks before the Beaujolais actually arrives. In Paris wine 
bars, in suburban cafes, and in bar/brasseries, the signs blare, " Le Nouveau 
Est Arrive !"  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, some shops keep the signs up year-around, implying that the nouveau 
is enjoyable any old time. The fact is, it's one of the most perishable of 
wines. Six months after release, it begins to tire. A year later only the best 
are still worth consuming. 
</P>
<P>
 The fad of nouveau has grown so great that today a third of all the wine of 
the Beaujolais region, some 3 1/2 million cases annually, is nouveau. And its 
fame is such that many consumers have the notion that this evanescent potable 
is the only Beaujolais. 
</P>
<P>
 Beaujolais producers, therefore, find it difficult to trumpet this wine and at 
the same time remind the buying public that they also make the more serious 
wine, the far grander Cru Beaujolais that will not be sold until the following 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, this festive day annually attracts ever-newer promotional efforts. 
Dozens of restaurants and wine shops in every major city in the United States 
stage special tastings and dinners built around the young wine. Many of these 
promotional campaigns last for weeks or even months after the third Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What makes the American enthusiasm for Beaujolais Nouveau unusual is that, 
unlike Europe, we consume little red wine the rest of the year. Not much more 
than 25% of the wine we buy is red; the rest is white or pink. By contrast, 
nine bottles out of 10 sold in France, Italy and the rest of southern Europe 
are red. 
</P>
<P>
 Since America is simply not a red wine-consuming nation, one might wonder why 
we go crazy for nouveau. (As we do.) The answer is only too simple -- nouveau 
is really little more than white wine with color. The astringent tannins found 
in most red wine are not found in nouveau, which is made with very low tannins 
and intended to be quaffed, not sipped. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason Beaujolais is a perfect wine for Americans is that we prefer 
our drinks served colder than do Europeans, and Beaujolais is one of the few 
red wines that is actually better when chilled. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Beaujolais has a flavor profile that should be perfect for those 
looking beyond White Zinfandel. The faint berry-ish component in White 
Zinfandel is delicately spicy. Good nouveau has that same flavor profile, but 
in spades. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a drawback to nouveau it is price. Nouveau Beaujolais should never 
be an expensive wine, but in the late 1980s the weakness of the U.S. dollar and 
the greed of some marketing people pushed prices for some nouveau wines close 
to and over $10 a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 In France, such wines sell for the equivalent of 20 to 25 francs a bottle ($4 
to $5), and even less. And since it costs no more than $1 per bottle to ship 
wine across the sea, it's clear that at $10 the wine is overpriced. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's prices for nouveau, posted by a number of Los Angeles wine shops 
in advance of delivery, are roughly $7, a fair price for the best. 
</P>
<P>
 Gamay Beaujolais is also made in California, and a number of producers make it 
in a nouveau style. Among the most consistent of these are from Beringer 
Vineyards, Sebastiani Vineyards, Preston Vineyards and Robert Pecota Winery. 
Prices range from $5 to $7. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the promotion of nouveau is artificial, but it is the fraternity of the 
day that appeals to wine lovers, who can imagine the same celebration going on 
not only at their own local cafe, but in pubs, bars and bistros around the 
world.

TASTING NOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 1991 S. Anderson Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon "Richard Chambers Vineyard" ($46) 
-- This Stag's Leap District wine is in limited supply, but it's worth seeking. 
The aroma has currants and berries with traces of cedar, sandalwood and spices. 
The finish is almost sweet it's so complete. The 20-acre Chambers vineyard, 
shared by S. Anderson and Shafer Vineyards, is one of the budding stars of the 
Napa Valley and this wine accents fruit, not oak. Expensive, but dramatically 
good. 
</P>
<P>
 *1991 Spottswoode Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon ($39) -- The aroma is ripe and 
loaded with berry and cassis notes, with the classic dried herbs so typical of 
the Napa Valley. The fruit is dense in the mouth, but there is a grace rarely 
found in such a deeply flavored wine. As good as Cabernet as I have had in the 
last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Fess Parker Vineyards Pinot Noir ($15) -- The former screen and 
television star (Davey Crockett) has made a striking statement off with this 
handsome, fruity wine from his Santa Barbara County vineyard that leaps into 
the league with the best of the region. The aromas are cherry, strawberry and 
cranberry, and the wine has so much fruit it almost tastes sweet, with a hint 
of cinnamon and nutmeg in the delicate yet long finish. Marvelous depth and 
complexity here. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1992 Armida Vineyards Chardonnay ($11) -- Delicious spiced pear and apple 
aroma, a hint of toast from oak aging, and a fresh, mouthwatering fruitiness in 
the aftertaste. A broadly appealing wine that doesn't have the buttery or 
butterscotch-y taste some people like, but it goes with a wide variety of 
foods. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1990 Iron Horse Vineyards Cabernets ($16) -- A combination of Cabernet 
Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, this is the best such blend yet made by winemaker 
Forest Tancer off his family-owned T-bar-T ranch in Alexander Valley. The fruit 
is deep and rich with cassis, anise and blackberry aromas; the taste has a mint 
and herbal complexity. The wine is deeply flavored and rich, but not heavy with 
oak or tannin. A bargain in a wine that should be long-lived, yet is already 
drinkable. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1992 Monterey Vineyard Classic Cabernet Sauvignon ($6) -- Surprisingly 
complex and deep Cabernet character for the price, with traces of herbs 
enhancing the black cherry and anise aftertaste. An excellent wine with the 
accent on fruit, not weight. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Hogue Cellars Semillon ($7.50) -- Spiced pear and melon aromas are 
dramatic proof that Columbia Valley in southern Washington is one of the 
blessed places on earth for this grape that is widely planted in France's 
Graves and Sauternes districts. The wine is dry, but succulently flavored in 
the finish. A companion wine, 1993 Hogue Cellars Fume Blanc ($7.50) is also 
exceptional, with pear, pine and dried herb aromas predominating. DAN BERGER

 Looking for great-tasting low-fat alternatives to slim down that traditional 
Thanksgiving dinner? 
</P>
<P>
 Our low-fat version of traditional scalloped corn casserole combines corn and 
broccoli in a custard base made of creamed corn, nonfat milk and egg 
substitute.Crushed fat-free crackers tossed with just enough melted butter for 
flavor are sprinkled over the top of the casserole during the last 10 minutes 
of baking.  
</P>
<P>
 Custards such as this one are best when baked in a water bath for gentle, even 
heat that will help to prevent overbaking. When done, a knife inserted near the 
center of the casserole should come out clean. Then remove from hot water to 
prevent further cooking. CORN AND BROCCOLI BAKED CUSTARD 
</P>
<P>
 1 (8 1/2-ounce) can creamed corn 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup nonfat egg substitute (equivalent to 4 eggs)

</P>
<P>
 3/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/8 teaspoon white pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup fat-free saltine cracker crumbs (about 8 saltine crackers) 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons melted butter 
</P>
<P>
 Combine creamed corn, egg substitute and milk in bowl until blended. Stir in 
corn, broccoli and green onions. Add salt and white pepper. Pour into 2-quart 
casserole lightly buttered or sprayed with nonstick cooking spray.  
</P>
<P>
 Set casserole in baking pan large enough to hold it comfortably on middle rack 
of oven. Fill baking pan with boiling water halfway up sides of casserole. Bake 
at 350 degrees 40 to 50 minutes or until center is set. Toss together saltine 
crumbs and butter. Sprinkle over top of casserole during last 10 minutes of 
baking. Makes 6 servings.

THANKSGIVING FAMILY SECRETS; PANICKY POPOVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My mother claimed to enjoy holiday entertaining, but if this was so, she 
enjoyed it the way athletes enjoy a big race or actors enjoy a major 
performance: She liked mounting tension and a last minute rush of adrenaline, 
the bigger the better. Which is to say, after the turkey was roasted, the 
potatoes mashed, the onions creamed, the rutabagas pureed, the cranberries 
gelled, the pies baked -- just when there was a scant hour before we sat down 
to eat -- she had to make a batch of popovers. 
</P>
<P>
 It would seem, for a while, that the success of the whole dinner depended on 
whether or not these most temperamental of bread products actually "popped" -- 
although sometimes this tension was eclipsed by whether or not my Uncle Wes 
would arrive suitably dressed for company. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thanksgiving, I'd wake up early and help Mom get the turkey into the oven. 
My sister and I had the job of tearing bread slices for the dressing and I had 
the dubious honor of pulling pin feathers out of the bird. I might peel 
potatoes or wipe water marks off the silverplate, but basically, my mother's 
kitchen a one-woman show. My father ran errands for her -- fetched ice, 
last-minute groceries, liquor -- and invariably stayed away far longer than she 
thought he should, leaving her stalled midway through a cream sauce or a 
mincemeat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I remained in the kitchen as long as I could, watching in fascination as she 
stitched the turkey shut and set the guts to boil on the stove. Sooner or 
later, in the assembling of cranberry aspic with walnuts and sour cream, green 
salad or baked yams, my constant inquiries annoyed her.  
</P>
<P>
 "Art," she'd call. "Do something with the girls." 
</P>
<P>
 By noon, the atmosphere in the kitchen was so tense, you couldn't get near it 
without gasping for air. I could hear her moving in there: the creak of the 
stove, a low and continuous muttering punctuated by sharp epithets, the shoving 
of pots and pans, and an occasional cry to my father. 
</P>
<P>
 " Arrrrt . . . I told you to buy half and half. This is whipping cream!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My father would brave the fray, locate the half and half which he'd put on the 
wrong shelf in the refrigerator, and come out looking something like Woody 
Allen emerging from the Orgasmatron. For the most part, we -- my sister, my 
father and I -- laid low. 
</P>
<P>
 When the end was in sight, my dad would slip out to go pick up his brother 
Wes. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother would catch him on his way out. "Art, I want you to make sure your 
brother is decently dressed this time." (Wes, the family eccentric, dressed 
with a flair my mother did not always appreciate). 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, by the time my dad was en route to get Wes, the turkey was out of the 
oven, the guests were beginning to arrive and it was suicide to go anywhere 
near the kitchen, my mother would start her popovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Popovers aren't hard to make. A cup of milk, a cup of flour, two eggs, some 
butter. Dash of salt. My mother had an antique popover pan she'd bought in Port 
Angeles, Wash. It held 11 popovers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She would only make one batch; her mother would bring homemade yeasted rolls. 
But Mom loved popovers and wanted popovers and also maybe wanted to raise the 
pitch of tension one more notch -- at any rate, nobody could talk her out of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the popovers were in the oven, she'd pour herself a drink and sit down 
with whatever guests had arrived, although she'd be up and down, peering in the 
oven's window, fretting if the popovers would pop. Most of the time, they did, 
just like they're supposed to: They popped into little balloons of lovely, 
buttery crust, the interior hollow with moist, custardy walls. 
</P>
<P>
 One year, however, she used margarine instead of butter, and she pulled out 
squat little brown plugs. Other times, they didn't pop much. I was the one who 
passed judgment on whether they were popovers or pop-unders. 
</P>
<P>
 One Thanksgiving, I picked Wes up and drove him over to our house. I had made 
the ritual promise to my mother that he would be dressed well and I thought he 
looked just fine: a white sweater with red snowflakes, reasonably clean, and a 
pair of old wool dress slacks, also reasonably clean. We arrived just after my 
mother had put the popovers in the oven. The turkey was resting on the carving 
platter. She'd poured herself a Scotch and we were all sitting uneasily in the 
living room waiting for other guests to arrive. She'd already gotten up once to 
see if the popovers were popping but it was too early to tell. I sat next to 
Wes on the sofa. My mother was talking anxiously. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't let me forget to put the butter and jam out. And wineglasses? Oh, and 
I've got sour cream for the cranberries . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Her voice trailed off. She was staring at Wes' ankles. Soon, we were all 
looking down toward Wes' feet, where a ruffle of cloth emerged from his pants 
cuffs.  
</P>
<P>
 "Wes," my mother said sharply. "Are you wearing two pair of pants?" 
</P>
<P>
 He looked down at the telltale ruffle, then slowly up at my mother. He knew he 
had to come up with a good explanation, or she'd go through the roof before our 
very eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first pair was dirty," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As if on cue the oven timer went off: time to turn down the heat on the 
popovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky for us, they'd popped. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I'd been living on my own and cooking for years before I attempted a popover. 
After all those Thanksgivings, I thought they were as delicate and testy as the 
most temperamental souffles. I was stunned to discover they were only a little 
iffy. There are all sorts of techniques, I discovered -- starting in a cold 
oven, starting in a hot oven and turning down the heat, beating the eggs with 
the milk and adding flour, beating the milk with the flour and adding eggs. 
Almost all these methods have pretty good success rates. I also became fond of 
making one huge popover, really a kind a Yorkshire pudding without meat 
drippings, which for years I served as a breakfast treat, usually to guests. 
</P>
<P>
 The only time popover technique really became an issue for me was recently, 
when we tried to make my one huge popover in a skillet in The Times Test 
Kitchen. We produced failure after failure: flop-overs, I called them. (It 
should be noted that even the flattest, least inflated versions were avidly 
devoured by everyone who tasted them.) Back in my own kitchen, I made one more 
flop and then got down to business, reading cookbooks, and trying to remember 
how I used to make the giant thing. I finally tried a casual version of the 
Yorkshire pudding recipe in "Joy of Cooking" and by mixing the ingredients 
differently than for a regular popover, and altering the cooking temperature 
and time, I finally hit gold. Pulling that big crusty, buttery bubble from the 
oven, I felt like my mother on a triumphant Thanksgiving afternoon calling out 
to all assembled. "All right. Let's eat!"  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here is my mother's recipe, ever so slightly adapted from the "Settlement 
Cookbook."  
</P>
<P>
 POPOVERS 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup flour 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 2 eggs 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup milk 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon butter, melted 
</P>
<P>
 Sift flour and salt into bowl. Beat eggs with rotary beater in separate mixing 
bowl and add milk and butter. Sift in flour-salt mixture, then beat only enough 
to make smooth batter. 
</P>
<P>
 Fill hot buttered muffin tins 1/3 full of mixture. Bake at 450 degrees 30 
minutes, then reduce temperature to 350 degrees and bake 15 more minutes or 
until firm, brown and popped. Keep oven door closed while baking. Makes 13 
popovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Each popover contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 61 calories; 74 mg sodium; 36 mg cholesterol; 2 grams fat; 8 grams 
carbohydrates; 3 grams protein; 0.03 gram fiber. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 This recipe is adapted from the Y orkshire pudding recipe in " Joy of Cooking. 
" I say that it makes four servings, but two good eaters can dispatch one whole 
recipe painlessly. Don't worry if this flops: It still tastes great, and makes 
a perfect buttery vehicle for your favorite preserves.  
</P>
<P>
 ONE GIANT POPOVER 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup flour 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup milk 
</P>
<P>
 2 eggs 
</P>
<P>
 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons butter 
</P>
<P>
 Place 10-inch cast-iron skillet in 400-degree oven. 
</P>
<P>
 Sift flour and salt into mixing bowl. Add milk and beat on medium speed with 
electric mixer until smooth. Add eggs, 1 at time, and continue beating until 
large bubbles come to surface when you momentarily pause beating process, about 
30 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Put butter in heated skillet still in oven and allow butter to melt without 
browning. (Open oven as little as possible to keep oven hot.) Make sure butter 
coats bottom and sides of pan. Quickly pour batter into skillet. Bake at 400 
degrees 20 minutes, then reduce heat to 350 another 15 to 20 minutes. Serve 
immediately with jam and butter, if desired. Makes 4 servings. Each serving 
contains about:

 198 calories; 239 mg sodium; 119 mg cholesterol; 7 grams fat; 25 grams 
carbohydrates; 8 grams protein; 0.09 gram fiber.

THANKSGIVING FAMILY SECRETS; ONIONS: GRANDMA CREAMED 'EM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Remarkable, what a celebration can do for a child's palate.  
</P>
<P>
 Serve a little girl small boiled onions in cream sauce and she'll say, 
"Aaargh!" She'll make a scene. Seat her at her grandmother's Thanksgiving 
table, offer her small boiled onions in cream sauce from a cut-glass bowl with 
a large silver spoon for serving, and she'll daintily take a portion. 
</P>
<P>
 And she'll remember them -- inexplicably -- as the heart of her Thanksgiving 
feast. 
</P>
<P>
 Not her grandmother's gossamer mashed potatoes. Not the big bird pulled 
bronzed from the oven. Not the fascinating giblet gravy or the richly scented 
stuffing, nor the buttered Brussels sprouts nor the brown sugar-candied sweet 
potatoes, the ruby-colored fresh cranberry sauce, the tangy icebox pickles, the 
hot, ethereally light rolls, not even the velvety pumpkin pie nor the apple-y 
mince pie and the billows of whipped cream. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No, it's the creamed onions that first spring to mind when I think of my 
grandmother's Thanksgiving dinners. And what's even more curious is that the 
same thing happened with my children. The creamed onions were the first dish 
our eldest son always chose from the abundance on the table.  
</P>
<P>
 Taken in their parts, you can be sure whole baby onions are unfamiliar to most 
children. But right away, the onions' size is appealing -- they're in scale. 
And their construction is fascinating, layer upon translucent layer. Finally, 
their flavor is lightly sweet and vaguely earthy, right up a child's alley. As 
for the sauce, it is pure yet luxuriant, sublimely buttered and creamed.  
</P>
<P>
 Plus which, the onion bumps under a blanket are fun. When a child's fork hits 
a ball, chances are the ball will scoot, and "catch-the-creamed-onion" makes a 
great game -- if you're not caught at it.  
</P>
<P>
 At Thanksgiving, pressures of the everyday are off, the air is charged with 
laughter and conversation, and children share in the spirit by becoming 
adventurous at the feast -- the second dish our eldest son reached for was the 
Brussels sprouts. Although everyone's on company manners, Thanksgiving's 
company is family and friends. The purpose of the meal isn't nourishment. The 
purpose -- oh, joy -- is pleasure. To celebrate being together. To share good 
things. Gratitude.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I couldn't be more grateful for the traditions my grandmother handed on to me 
and mine. But she'd laugh if she knew it was the creamed onions that symbolize 
her splendid cornucopia at Thanksgiving.  
</P>
<P>
 My grandmother's onions were cooked according to the method given in her 1902 
copy of "Mrs. Rorer's New Cook Book" by Sarah Tyson Rorer. Rorer admonishes, 
"If the onions are not thoroughly drained, they will dilute the cream sauce, 
making it watery in the bottom of the dish." Rorer's onion-drying technique can 
be applied to almost any vegetable that will finish in a sauce.  
</P>
<P>
 If baby onions aren't available, cook two-inch white onions. Then just before 
blending with the sauce, slice them in half between root and stem ends. Their 
shapes are fetching.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, I've been adventurous myself at Thanksgiving. I add depth to the cream 
sauce by first simmering the half-and-half (today's version of Rorer's "light 
cream") with savory seasonings. Then I add color by stirring in fine shreds of 
carrots and finishing the dish with flecks of parsley. Although I know at first 
she'd sniff at my sassiness, in time -- I also know -- my grandmother would 
embrace the new tradition.  
</P>
<P>
 CREAMED ONIONS 
</P>
<P>
 2 pounds small white boiling onions  
</P>
<P>
 Salt  
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 scrubbed carrots, optional  
</P>
<P>
 Light Cream Sauce 
</P>
<P>
 Red or black pepper, preferably cayenne  
</P>
<P>
 Dash nutmeg  
</P>
<P>
 Small handful finely chopped parsley, preferably flat-leaf, optional  
</P>
<P>
 Drop onions into 3 quarts boiling water in broad heavy pot. Count 3 minutes, 
then lift onions out, reserving water. Peel onions by slicing off root end with 
knife, pulling off skin, finally snipping off any tag on top. 
</P>
<P>
 Stir scant 4 teaspoons salt into onion water and return to boil. Drop in 
peeled onions and cook, uncovered, at boiling point just until tender when 
pierced with thin skewer, about 15 minutes for small onions, up to 25 for 
2-inch onions.  
</P>
<P>
 Drain onions well. Return to empty pot and set over low heat, shaking pot 
frequently, until onions are thoroughly dry, about 5 minutes. Onions can be 
wrapped and refrigerated at this point.  
</P>
<P>
 Slice carrots crosswise 1/8-inch thick, then slice rounds 1/8-inch thick into 
strips, to equal 1 cup. Turn into medium-size skillet, cover with water, bring 
to boil. Then simmer, uncovered, just until tender, about 3 minutes. Keep in 
broth. Carrots can also be refrigerated. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 minutes before serving, blend onions and Light Cream Sauce in pot. 
Heat over boiling water or lowest heat, stirring occasionally. Season to taste 
with salt and pepper. Add nutmeg. If adding shredded carrots, heat carrots 
separately in pan. Then add when ready to serve, stirring just enough to blend. 
For carrot color to shine, shreds should not be swamped in sauce. Turn into 
heated serving bowl. Sprinkle with parsley. Makes 8 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 261 calories; 392 mg sodium; 60 mg cholesterol; 20 grams fat; 17 grams 
carbohydrates; 5 grams protein; 0.71 gram fiber. Light Cream Sauce 
</P>
<P>
 1 quart half-and-half  
</P>
<P>
 1 carrot, chopped  
</P>
<P>
 1/2 onion, chopped  
</P>
<P>
 1 leafy stalk celery, chopped  
</P>
<P>
 4 sprigs parsley  
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup butter, preferably unsalted  
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup all-purpose flour  
</P>
<P>
 In pot combine half-and-half, chopped carrot, onion, celery and parsley. Bring 
to simmer, stir, then simmer, uncovered, 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
Strain through fine sieve into quart measuring pitcher. There should be 2 1/2 
cups liquid. 
</P>
<P>
 Melt butter in heavy 4- to 6-cup saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour, 
turn heat to low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until raw flour smell goes 
away but before mixture colors, 2 minutes. Slowly whisk in half-and-half, 
carefully whisking until smooth after each addition. Whisk over medium heat 
until sauce thickens. Again turn heat to low and cook 2 minutes more, whisking 
frequently. Remove from heat. 
</P>
<P>
 If being prepared in advance, lay plastic wrap on surface to keep skin from 
forming. Refrigerate up to 24 hours.

THANKSGIVING FAMILY SECRETS; WHAT'S BREAD IN THE COFFEE CAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most of my family was living in California by the 1880s, and their various 
culinary heritages -- New England, Southern and Midwestern -- had begun to take 
on a uniform Californian quality by the time I was on the scene. But not my 
Perry grandfather, the only one of my grandparents not born out here. He came 
from a rather New England-y part of upstate New York, where Perrys westering in 
from Massachusetts had been thick on the ground since the early 18th Century, 
and a mere 60 years of living in California hadn't altered his tastes. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the Thanksgiving meal was a menu a lot of people would recognize: 
turkey with sage stuffing, cranberry preserves, mashed potatoes, candied yams 
(possibly due to my Southern grandmother's influence), succotash, green and 
Jell-O salads, corn bread and hot rolls. But for Granddad's sake, we always had 
brown bread. 
</P>
<P>
 Insofar as people outside New England know of brown bread, they think of it as 
something to make canapes and cream cheese sandwiches with, and possibly to eat 
with baked beans. To Granddad, and consequently to us, it was a bread -- a 
dark, sweet, dessert-like bread you ate at Thanksgiving and Christmas.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brown bread is more like an English steamed pudding than an oven bread. The 
traditional shape is cylindrical, because for many decades people have usually 
steamed it in an empty coffee can, rather than a pudding mold.  
</P>
<P>
 One theory is that New Englanders invented brown bread because they couldn't 
make an English risen loaf with cornmeal, and wheat often didn't do as well in 
the local climate as rye. Meanwhile, New Englanders always had a lot of 
molasses on hand due to their trade contacts with the Caribbean, so why not 
make pudding? 
</P>
<P>
 For Thanksgiving Grandmother often made her own starchy brown pudding from 
graham flour, which was like a cross between brown bread and fruitcake. When 
both were served at the same meal, we sometimes felt we'd reached the limit of 
how much dense, spongy, sweet brown stuff a person could eat. But it wouldn't 
have been Thanksgiving without brown bread. RAISIN BROWN BREAD 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup milk 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon white vinegar or lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup rye flour 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup cornmeal 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup whole-wheat flour 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup raisins 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon baking soda 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger 
</P>
<P>
 Ground cloves 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup molasses 
</P>
<P>
 In bowl mix milk with white vinegar. Let stand at room temperature 10 to 15 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mix rye flour, cornmeal, whole-wheat flour, raisins, baking soda, salt, ginger 
and dash cloves in large bowl. Stir in molasses and milk. Blend well. 
</P>
<P>
 Butter clean 12-ounce coffee can. Pour in batter. Cover mouth of can with foil 
and place in deep pot. Add boiling water halfway up can. Cover pot and steam 
over moderate heat, replacing water if necessary, until straw inserted to 
middle of bread comes out clean, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove from heat and let stand on rack 10 minutes, then unmold. While still 
hot, slice by drawing string around bread, crossing, and pulling ends. Can be 
reheated in 300-degree oven. Makes 10 servings.

THANKSGIVING FAMILY SECRETS; THE GRAYS' OYSTER CULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCHUYLER INGLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have to think that the Grays are responsible for my growing up with oyster 
stuffing on the table. My father's aunt Lilian married John Gray and moved from 
her home in Colville in northeast Washington state to a wheat farm in the Big 
Bend country of south central Washington. Washtucna was the nearest town. It's 
still there. And so too is the Gray farm though "young" Walt has retired and 
entered into a deal with the state Department of Natural Resources to put the 
land back into native grasses and encourage the deer and pheasant to thrive. It 
was Walt's grandfather, Walter Gray, who built the farm. And I suspect Walter 
Gray is responsible for oyster stuffing on the table come Thanksgiving. He was 
British, after all. 
</P>
<P>
 My father and his parents would drive from Colville to the Gray farm each 
Thanksgiving, an all day drive in the 1930s, a matter of a couple of hours 
today. They would stop in Spokane for hard rolls from the Davenport Hotel 
delicatessen and bakery and for Dungeness crab and Willipa oysters from the 
fish monger. Along the way they would cut a Christmas tree and tie it to the 
top of the car. If it had snowed by Thanksgiving, not an uncommon occurrence in 
eastern Washington, the going was precarious at best. 
</P>
<P>
 That first night of arrival would be taken up with eating the crab. The rolls 
and oysters were saved for the next day. John Gray would have visited a 
neighboring farm that morning and come home with a big turkey, now snoozing 
through its last turkey dreams out there in the chicken coop. Ingles and Grays 
would have eaten family style, passing big platters and bowls of food.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The next day the dining would be a bit more formal. The best linen, the best 
china, the best crystal, the best silver would all be laid out for the 
occasion. John Gray would stand at his end of the table. Lilian would walk in 
with a perfectly cooked bird. And then John Gray would both carve and serve 
from his place without getting a bit of meat or stuffing on the linen. He was a 
proud man. 
</P>
<P>
 And so too was his father, Walter. By the time I came along the only way I 
could distinguish John Gray from his brother Joe was that the one wheat farmer 
wore striped overalls while the other wore solid blue. They both fit right in 
on the sidewalks of Washtucna, squinting into the sun, sharing a bit of gossip. 
That is not how they started out, however. Old photos show young boys dressed 
in the style of Little Lord Fauntleroy, all curls, silks, and velvets. The two 
lads were packed off to a British boarding school for a proper education, 
though Walter relented soon enough. Instead, he shipped in young women tutors 
from Boston to teach his boys how to be businessmen and bankers. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Gray came from a British farming family with land that stretches back 
to Norman times. It is still in the family and is still farmed. In fact, the 
Gray family is responsible for one of Britain's best hard apple ciders. Walter, 
however, was not the eldest son. So he shipped out to Canada, then found his 
way down into the Oregon Territory, eventually opening a dry goods business in 
Sprague, Wash. By the time he built his dream farm replete with Georgian 
outbuildings he had retired from business save for his position on the board of 
the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Gray had a profound stutter and was always found with either a pair of 
gloves in his hands, or a swagger stick. He would use these objects to beat out 
the time in the palm of his hand while he spoke. He looked and acted the part 
of an English gentleman and must have been woefully surprised to have raised 
two red necked American wheat farmers for sons. Two things stuck with the lads, 
however. One was Walter's imperious attitude, particularly toward hired hands, 
and the other had to do with the food on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 There were chutneys and all manner of oddball savory puddings, mint sauce with 
lamb (and this in a neighborhood where to this day hardly any farm family will 
eat lamb), Yorkshire pudding with roast beef, trifle. And some of these dishes 
passed on from Lilian to her sister Jessie, my grandmother, and from there down 
through my own family to me. Oyster stuffing was just one such dish, and it had 
to be served with the turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 If I correctly recall the flavors of my youth, the stuffing was often green 
with sage and strong enough to bring on a gag response in a young boy cajoled 
into giving it a taste. It took me years to develop a fondness for oysters. And 
then Sharon Kramis turned up with this variation on the oyster stuffing theme, 
the original recipe coming from Heck Brown, Larry Brown's father. The sage is 
light. The oysters whisper of the ocean. And the hazelnuts somehow create a 
magical, flavorful bridge between shellfish and turkey meat. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Gray aside, I can't imagine a Thanksgiving without oyster stuffing. 
</P>
<P>

 This is an adaptation of HECK Brown's oyster stuffing, printed in " Northwest 
Bounty , " by Schuyler Ingle and Sharon Kramis.  
</P>
<P>
 OYSTER AND HAZELNUT STUFFING 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey giblets 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup water 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/4 cup hazelnuts 
</P>
<P>
 1 large onion, finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 2 stalks celery, finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 4 tablespoons butter 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced 
</P>
<P>
 1 (10-ounce) jar oysters, drained 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon poultry seasoning 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon ground thyme 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons ground sage 
</P>
<P>
 6 tablespoons melted butter 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons kosher salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
</P>
<P>
 2 1/2 quarts day old white bread cubes, diced  
</P>
<P>
 Chicken stock 
</P>
<P>
 In pan simmer giblets in water over low heat until tender, about 1 hour. 
</P>
<P>
 When giblets cool down, finely chop giblets. Reserve cooking liquid. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell hazelnuts, then spread hazelnuts in shallow pan. Roast at 275 degrees 25 
minutes. Remove and let cool. Remove skins by rubbing hazelnuts with kitchen 
towel. Coarsely chop. 
</P>
<P>
 In skillet saute onion and celery in 1/4 cup butter until tender. Add 
mushrooms. Continue cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 Chop oysters. In large bowl combine giblets, hazelnuts, onion, celery, 
mushrooms, butter from sauteing onion, poultry seasoning, thyme, sage, melted 
butter, salt and pepper. Add bread cubes and enough chicken stock to make 
stuffing moist, but not soggy. 
</P>
<P>
 Then stuff dressing into turkey just before roasting. If there is leftover 
stuffing, place in buttered casserole, cover, and bake about 1 hour. Makes 
enough stuffing for 20 pound turkey, about 10 servings.

THANKSGIVING FAMILY SECRETS; KUGEL, FRANCE AND MOI  
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Le Jour de Merci Donnant is French for Thanksgiving . . . at least according 
to Art Buchwald's now-classic column "The Pumpkin Papers," a hilariously 
literal English-to-French explanation of the holiday. In the four years I've 
been living in France I've offered that story to many of mes amis who have 
studied l'Anglais.  
</P>
<P>
 When Buchwald's tale of the Peaux-Rouges and the stalwart Kilometres Deboutish 
provokes terminal puzzlement, I simplify matters and talk about the Pilgrims 
and the harvest's end. I add -- as Buchwald also observes -- that Thanksgiving 
is the one day of the year when Americans sit down to a meal as long and as 
lavish as the typical French Sunday lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is something my friends here in the Gallic heartland can relate to. Every 
last one of them lives to eat. And since they regularly call upon me to defend 
American food against their stereotype of all Yanks living on "McDo" burgers, I 
consider it my patriotic duty at Thanksgiving to make them the traditional 
dinner of turkey and gravy, some sort of stuffing, sweet potatoes (though I 
would never expose my homeland to the derision a marshmallow topping would 
surely elicit) and cranberry sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 I should add that I'm primarily motivated by sentiment. Thanksgiving is the 
only holiday I cannot imagine not celebrating, especially while living in 
another country. (One virulent attack of homesickness accounted for my paying 
the equivalent of $15 for a box of honey grahams in Paris, plus another $8 for 
Saltines.)  
</P>
<P>
 And nostalgia alone mandates noodle pudding, or kugel, on my Turkey Day menu. 
Kugel has been part of my Thanksgiving meal as long as I can remember, starting 
with my grandma Sadie's version. Knock on wood, it shall always remain so. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Making kugel for my French friends long presented a problem, however. I was in 
central France. My heirloom recipe was in Greenwich Village, tucked into Vol. 
II of "Mastering the Art of French Cooking." So for three years I improvised -- 
going so far as to concoct a savory kugel using fresh goat cheese and chives. 
(Location also obliges substituting creme fraiche for sour cream and fromage 
blanc for cottage cheese.)  
</P>
<P>
 When I finally returned to Manhattan last year, crucial errands had to wait. 
First task: Get the noodle pudding recipe. Now I've got it. The real thing, on 
the original crumpled, grease-stained foolscap.  
</P>
<P>
 I wish I could say the recipe below is Sadie's. It is not. I baked Sadie's 
kugel for many years, but on or around 1978 I tasted a better kugel at a 
holiday buffet, spent the evening dogging the well-upholstered matron, Barbara 
Sackowitz, who made it, and at last got her recipe. I have been turning out 
this version ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadie's was easy to make and wonderful to eat -- real mittel-Europa stuff; 
dense, sit-on-your-stomach fare. Barbara's was, simply, the Platonic ideal of 
noodle pudding. The principles had been identified and abstracted, the flavor 
refined and the balance improved (chiefly because the eggs are separated and 
the whites beaten).  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, I now realize, Barbara's kugel is . . . rather French. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most kugel recipes, this one calls for baking at relatively low 
temperatures for two hours. It should not be runny (think of it as like bread 
pudding). It will feed a crowd of at least 10 hungry eaters.  
</P>
<P>

THANKSGIVING; PUMPKIN WITHOUT THE PIE

<P>
 I can't remember a Thanksgiving when I cooked all the food single-handedly. 
For the past few years, our family has enjoyed this day of feasting with good 
friends. What makes the celebration so special for all of us is that everyone 
shares in preparing and assembling the meal. Most often, the friends who host 
the dinner roast the turkey, while others volunteer to bring appetizers, side 
dishes and desserts. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu, always determined by a serious of telephone conversations, will 
begin this year with a wild mushroom tart, followed by herbed roast turkey, 
wild rice and apple stuffing, as well as corn bread and leek dressing. 
Vegetables and condiments will include acorn squash halves baked with a pecan 
and maple syrup glaze, creamed onions, broccoli florets tossed with roasted 
garlic and cranberry-orange relish. Pumpkin-caramel custard, pears baked with 
honey and orange and a glorious platter of fresh fruit will end the repast. 
</P>
<P>
 One of my contributions will be the custard, the recipe has been in my files 
for more than a decade. An assistant at my cooking school gave me the 
directions for this delicious creation several years ago, but it was not until 
this fall that I pulled the tattered and yellowed paper from a folder and 
decided to try it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The confection, made by caramelizing a souffle dish and then filling it with a 
mixture of sweetened evaporated milk, eggs, sugar, canned pumpkin and spices, 
is baked until firm, and then cooled and unmolded. It can be served as is or 
with whipped cream. The dish can be made a day in advance, alleviating 
last-minute holiday work, and if you are concerned about lowering fat grams 
(even on Thanksgiving!) you can use evaporated skim milk (as I did) and egg 
substitutes. PUMPKIN-CARAMEL CUSTARD 
</P>
<P>
 Sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup water 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup canned pumpkin, unsweetened and without spices 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups evaporated skim milk 
</P>
<P>
 5 large eggs or equivalent of egg substitute, lightly beaten 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
 1/8 teaspoon ground allspice 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup whipping cream, whipped until just firm 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare caramel, place 3/4 cup sugar and water in medium heavy saucepan 
over medium heat. Stir just to dissolve sugar. Bring mixture to boil, without 
stirring, until caramelized, 7 to 10 minutes. Immediately pour caramel into 1 
1/2-quart souffle dish or ramekin. Hold dish with potholders and tilt and swirl 
dish to coat bottom and sides well with caramel. Set dish aside. 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare custard, place pumpkin and 1 1/4 cups sugar in mixing bowl. Whisk 
well to mix. Whisk in evaporated milk and then eggs. Whisk in vanilla, 
cinnamon, allspice and salt until incorporated. Pour mixture into prepared 
souffle dish. Cover tightly with foil. Place dish in large baking pan and pour 
in enough hot water to reach halfway up sides of souffle dish. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake custard at 350 degrees until firm, about 1 1/2 hours. Cool custard, 
uncovered, to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate until well chilled. 
Custard can be prepared 1 day ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 When ready to serve, run knife around sides of dish and invert custard onto 
serving dish. Drizzle any caramel in pan over top. If caramel seems to be 
sticking to bottom of souffle dish, place dish in skillet of simmering water to 
melt hardened caramel. Cut custard into 8 wedges. Serve each with dollop of 
whipped cream. Makes 8 servings.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: THE TACO OLYMPIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you've had the slightest encounter with street food in Mexico, you know how 
good tacos can be: tortillas made to order from little lumps of corn dough, a 
scant ounce or so of meat snatched sizzling from the grill, a scattering of 
chopped onion and a splash of pungent salsa, laid on a napkin and handed to you 
with the meat still bubbling, the surface of the tortilla still glazed form the 
heat of the griddle. Even at the busiest stands down south, nearly everything 
is made to order and from scratch -- which is, unfortunately, made possible by 
extremely low wages. A holiday in someone else's misery, I believe Johnny 
Rotten once said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are a zillion taquerias in Los Angeles, and some of them are 
extremely good, strung out along the major boulevards in South L.A. and the 
east San Fernando Valley, sometimes forming little taco districts. 
</P>
<P>
 While not quite on the level of those Mexican walking streets where one vendor 
specializes in grilled beef, the next in roast pork and a third in tongue, Los 
Angeles taquerias have styles of their own. And on Olympic Boulevard, as it 
courses through East Los Angeles, half a dozen good taco stands are scattered 
along a couple miles of road, and maybe twice as many taco trucks. You can 
find, I believe, almost every kind of taco available in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Rustic: Blasting east on Olympic from downtown, you can smell Tacos Leovis two 
blocks before you see it, from the sweet whiff of roasting meat and burnt 
chiles that blasts through the internal combustion fumes on this heavily 
trafficked stretch of road. There are a lot of gypsy taquerias grilling meat 
over open sidewalk fires late on weekend nights, but this is the place to come 
in the afternoon, a battered metal cart where vertical spitfuls of pork rotate 
before a roaring fire in the al pastor -- shepherd's -- style. . . . I've seen 
stake-bed trucks make screeching U-turns when their drivers spot the grill.  
</P>
<P>
 Order a few tacos with grilled onions, grab a cold Mexican apple soda from an 
ice bucket and garnish the tacos yourself from a buffet-style salsa bar -- the 
tart green salsa is better than the lackluster red. You pay, and sit inside, at 
the counter of the restaurant proper behind the sidewalk cart. 
</P>
<P>
 Bargain: You can usually spot a bargain taqueria such as El Capitan Taqueria 
by the bold legend "2X100" painted on nearly every flat surface of the joint -- 
including the truck that usually serves as the restaurant -- and by the long 
line of people waiting for their food. A bargain taco, though cheap, can be 
tasty -- shavings of roast goat or grilled beef or whatever folded with green 
salsa and the usual cilantro-onion thing into a pair of silver-dollar-size 
tortillas. Essentially, it's another style of taco. What you taste is heated 
corn inflected by spicy condiments, a small amount of meat stretched into a 
meal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Specialist: Antojitos Denise's is a small, sweet taco stand near an 
elementary school, whose customer base consists largely of people waiting for 
the MTA at the bus stop right in front. A caricature of Denise is painted on 
one wall, and if you poke your head into the takeout window, there's Denise 
herself, chopping meat, working the register, folding her special burritos.  
</P>
<P>
 In a land dominated by carne asada , Denise's is where to go for pork, a 
bagful of one of the three or four different kinds of house-made chicharrones , 
fried pork rinds, perhaps, the pickled pigskin called cueritos or a pound or 
two of the roast pork carnitas . If you have a buck for a taco, you can taste 
what are among the best carnitas in East L.A., dense-textured, with the full, 
almost gamy flavor of slow-cooked pork. Also good are the tacos with 
chicharrones stewed in spicy tomato sauce, numbingly rich, a 1,500-calorie 
taco. 
</P>
<P>
 The Classicist: If the timing is right, Taqueria Tlaquepaque can come as close 
to a good Mexican taqueria as any place on the Eastside, serving freshly 
grilled tortillas rich with the flavor of toasted corn, chile-crusted bits of 
pork al pastor , a blazingly hot red salsa with a bracing jolt of vinegar, and 
a sweet onion garnish that has nearly melted away in the course of its 
sauteeing. These are the kind of tacos you may polish off before you find a 
table. There is a full range of Mexican sodas available, including the 
superior, sugar-sweetened Mexican Coke, a truck out back sells a full line of 
seafood cocktails and prices are reasonable. But the tacos can be inconsistent 
-- if you order three different kinds, only one will be great, sometimes the 
buche , sometimes the carne asada , and it's never the same one twice.

THANKSGIVING; 'TIS THE NUTSY SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROBERTS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The walnut harvest has just come to a close in California, where 99% of all 
U.S. production occurs. The walnuts grown in California are the European 
variety, actually called English walnuts. The first trees were planted in the 
late 1700s and the first commercial California crop was planted in Santa 
Barbara in 1867. 
</P>
<P>
 Walnuts are, arguably, the world's most popular nut. In fact, in several 
languages, French among them, the generic word for nut and the name of the 
walnut are the same. In English, walnut means "foreigner's nut." 
</P>
<P>
 The Greeks and Romans thought that walnuts, whose two meat halves resemble a 
brain, cured headaches. 
</P>
<P>
 In France and Italy, one finds dehusked fresh walnuts in the outdoor markets 
in September and October. The nutmeats have a lighter color, creamier texture 
and a less nutty flavor, milder than the mature nuts that we love. They are 
eaten raw, or cooked in syrup or pickled in a vinegar brine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Italy, fresh walnuts are used to make a sweet nut-flavored liqueur. Walnuts 
are great additions to cooked dishes. Soak the meats of mature, dry walnuts in 
milk overnight and you will regain much of their fresh flavor. I find that this 
technique greatly improves the results of dishes with cooked walnuts by 
diminishing any bitter aftertaste that the nuts might impart to a sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Walnuts can thicken sauces, both cooked and uncooked, as well as soups. Their 
flavor in a sauce for turkey, for instance, is perfect for this time of the 
year. I don't use the nuts to thicken the gravy, only to add flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 Try substituting walnuts soaked in milk for the usual pine nuts in an Italian 
pesto or French pistou. The result is subtle but noticeable, and the walnuts 
add a counterpoint to the intense basil flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 Walnuts in the shell will remain fresh and tasty for months if kept in a cool, 
dry place. Like other nuts, though, they turn stale and rancid if stored at 
room temperature. If not vacuum sealed, they should be stored in airtight 
plastic food bags in the freezer for up to a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My puree of Brussels sprouts soup, which I finish with a dash of Pernod and 
walnut oil, is a holiday favorite among my friends. The same trick works with 
other green "gassy" vegetables such as broccoli and even zucchini. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the most common culinary use of walnuts is in salads. Happily, the 
walnut harvest coincides with the first appearance of winter apples and pears 
as well as Belgian endive. The following salad plays on the flavor 
juxtaposition of nutty, tannic nuts, slightly bitter endive and the salty 
"high" flavor of Stilton cheese, all cleansed by crisp apples. 
</P>
<P>
 Walnut oil, the dark, toasted kind, is an indispensable staple in my fall 
kitchen. I use it in place of the usual oil and vinegar to dress salads. For a 
simple salad, toss Bibb lettuce with equal parts walnut oil and freshly 
squeezed lemon juice. WALNUT GRAVY 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup walnut halves and pieces 
</P>
<P>
 Milk 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey drippings 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup flour 
</P>
<P>
 4 cups low-sodium chicken stock 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon dried sage 
</P>
<P>
 Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Night before roasting turkey, soak walnuts in bowl with milk to cover. Then 
refrigerate. After turkey is roasted, set aside and place roasting pan on stove 
over medium heat. Add butter and drained walnuts and cook, stirring, 5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Add flour and stir until mixture is smooth. Cook 1 minute longer. Add chicken 
stock, sage and salt and pepper to taste. Cook, stirring, to reduce gravy until 
sauce-like in consistency, about 5 minutes. Scrape into gravy boat and serve. 
</P>
<P>
 To freeze, place gravy in lidded plastic container and place in refrigerator 
to cool. Cover and freeze up to 6 months. Makes about 4 cups. WALNUT, APPLE, 
ENDIVE AND STILTON SALAD 
</P>
<P>
 3 heads Belgian endive

 1/2 pound Stilton cheese, crumbled 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons walnut oil 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Cut endive into 3/4-inch rounds and place in salad bowl. Add apple. Toss with 
lemon juice. Add walnuts, apple, cheese, walnut oil, salt and white pepper. 
Toss well. Makes 4 servings. PUREE OF BRUSSELS SPROUTS SOUP 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium onion, diced 
</P>
<P>
 5 cups halved Brussels sprouts 
</P>
<P>
 4 cups chicken stock or low-sodium chicken broth 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons walnut oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 capful Pernod, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Melt butter in soup pot over low heat. Add onion and cook, covered, about 7 
minutes, without browning. Add Brussels sprouts. Cook, covered, stirring 
frequently to avoid browning, 25 minutes. Stir in stock, then salt. 
</P>
<P>
 Cover and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer 20 minutes. Strain soup and 
reserve liquid. Transfer Brussels sprouts to blender or food processor and 
puree until very smooth. Return puree to soup pot and add reserved liquid until 
soup is of desired consistency. Stir in cream. 
</P>
<P>
 To finish soup, add walnut oil and Pernod to hot soup along with any pepper to 
taste. Serve piping hot in soup tureen or individually in bowls. Makes 4 to 6 
servings.

 A nonreactive pan is one made from a material that won't react with acidic 
ingredients. Nonstick, stainless-steel, lined or anodized aluminum, lined 
copper and enameled cast-iron are the most common types. Avoid unlined 
aluminum, copper and cast-iron pans when a nonreactive pot is specified in a 
recipe.

HOME COOK: THANKSGIVING; EVERYTHING BUT THE BIRD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARION CUNNINGHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid all the preparations for a holiday meal, it's easy to lose sight of the 
basic reason for the celebration. The appeal of Thanksgiving is in the 
simplicity of the day -- being with people we care about and sharing good food. 
For those of us who like to cook, there is the extra pleasure of arising early 
Thanksgiving morning, rolling up our sleeves and starting to cook. 
</P>
<P>
 To make things easier, the table will have been set the night before, some of 
the small preparations will have been completed and the pie crusts will be 
ready and waiting to be filled and baked. Once the pies are in the oven, it 
will be time to prepare the vegetable side dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 I find that I am increasingly attracted to simple foods, and that over the 
years I've slowly changed my vegetable side dishes accordingly. For example, I 
have dropped fresh coconut or bits of orange sections from the carrots. These 
days I simply cook young carrots and finish them with butter and parsley. 
</P>
<P>
 Beets, which are naturally sweet, are mixed with capers and vinegar for a 
little contrast and snap. A traditional Thanksgiving dinner is enhanced by a 
compote of winter fruits, whose full flavor is tinged with a pleasant sourness. 
Baked squash with maple syrup is a real American dish that can be a pleasant 
change from sweet potatoes or yams, and cabbage with pine nuts will surprise 
anyone who has never given that kingly vegetable its due (it is also one of the 
quickest dishes to make). 
</P>
<P>
 And then there are pearl onions, without which many feel Thanksgiving is 
incomplete. In this version, they are baked in a creamy onion sauce with a 
crisp topping of bread crumbs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today, more than ever, most of us have nearby farmers markets or greengrocers 
that take pride in offering an abundance of very fresh produce. And when you're 
using such basically good ingredients, you don't have to worry about fussing 
with them too much. In these recipes, Mother Nature has done most of the work 
for us, providing us with another blessing for which we gather to give thanks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since it cooks for less than half a minute, this cabbage retains its lovely 
green color and crisp texture. Toasted pine nuts look pretty on top and add a 
little crunch.  
</P>
<P>
 CABBAGE WITH PINE NUTS 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup pine nuts 
</P>
<P>
 1 large head green cabbage, coarsely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
 Salt

 A tasty complement to the dark meat of a turkey, this dish comes directly from 
the Northeast, the cradle of the Thanksgiving celebration. The maple syrup 
lends a distinct sweetness and seems to heighten the buttered squash flavor. 
For special effect, serve in scooped-out and baked acorn squash halves.  
</P>

1 hour or until squash is easily pierced with fork. Scoop flesh into bowl. Mash 
squash with potato masher or fork until fairly smooth. Season to taste with 
salt and pepper. Keep warm. 
</P>
<P>
 In small saucepan, combine butter and maple syrup and cook over low heat, 
stirring until butter is melted and blended with syrup, about 2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>

 The snappy, sharp flavors of tarragon, capers and vinegar balance the natural 
sweetness of the beets. Tarragon varies in strength, so you may want to add 
more or less, depending on individual taste. This sauce should have a 
pronounced tarragon flavor.  
</P>
<P>
 TARRAGON BEETS 
</P>
<P>
 3 pounds beets, without tops 
</P>
<P>
 Water 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup tarragon vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh tarragon or 1 1/2 teaspoons dried 
</P>
<P>
 5 tablespoons unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons drained capers 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Place beets in large saucepan with water to cover. Bring to boil. Cook until 
tender when pierced with fork, 30 to 40 minutes depending on size of beets. 
Alternatively, wrap beets in foil and bake at 400 degrees about 1 1/4 hours, 
until tender. Peel beets and cut into 1-inch pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 In large nonreactive saucepan, combine 1/4 cup water with vinegar and 
tarragon. Bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat to moderate and simmer 3 
minutes. Add butter and stir until melted. Add beets and cook, stirring, until 
heated through, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in capers. Season to 
taste with salt and pepper. Toss and serve hot. Makes 8 servings.

THANKSGIVING; BACK TO COBBLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICK MALGIERI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though Thanksgiving and pies are more or less synonymous, I think most of us 
wind up in a "pie rut" after a few years of preparing the holiday meal. To keep 
things simple, we prepare the same pies over and over, with no thought to 
varying the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 This year I'm making cobblers -- a type of deep-dish pie baked in a shallow 
dish with only a top crust -- as well as a few pies, among them a walnut 
(instead of pecan) pie and a meatless mince pie. 
</P>
<P>
 Mincemeat, a remnant of the medieval custom of cooking meat with fruits and 
spices, is one of our major imports from British baking. I always have been 
repelled by American and British recipes that suggest using chopped boiled 
tongue, beef brisket or venison, excellent foods in their own right, but not as 
ingredients in a dessert pie. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until I checked recipes for mincemeat in Isabella Beeton's "Book of 
Household Management," the bible of British cooking, that I found that meatless 
versions were common as early as 1861, the year in which Beeton's cookbook was 
first published. 
</P>
<P>
 Her first of two recipes for mincemeat includes beef and suet (beef fat) among 
the typical ingredients of apples, raisins, spices and brandy, but strangely 
gives no instructions for cooking either the meat or the whole mixture. 
</P>
<P>
 The next recipe, "excellent mincemeat," lists suet only, but calls for cooking 
the fruit separately and combining all the ingredients together before aging 
the mixture for several weeks, as in the version with meat. 
</P>
<P>
 The filling in the recipe below substitutes a small amount of butter for suet 
(Beeton used one pound of beef fat in a seven-pound batch) and has as robust a 
flavor or texture as any version that contains meat. The dough for both pies 
and the cobbler is a classic flaky pie dough, easily made in the food 
processor. It's simple to create and always turns out flaky and delicate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Try either pie or the cobbler for your celebration this year for a change of 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is the best and easiest pie dough I have ever worked with. It is easy to 
prepare and to roll out. Though it is not much effort to mix by hand, I find 
that using a food processor to prepare the dough makes it almost an instant 
process.  
</P>
<P>
 The baking powder encourages the dough to puff slightly while baking so that 
it presses into a hot pan bottom and bakes through evenly, preventing an 
underdone bottom crust.  
</P>
<P>
 The amount of water added to the dough is always variable. When the flour and 
butter mixture is very finely rubbed together and a little warm, it will absorb 
less water; when it is dry and cool and a little under-mixed, it will absorb 
more. Too little water makes a flaky crust that will crack during rolling; too 
much water makes an elastic, bread-like crust that lacks flakiness.  
</P>
<P>
 FLAKY PIE DOUGH 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/4 cups bleached all-purpose flour 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/8 teaspoon baking powder 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into 8 pieces 
</P>
<P>
 2 to 3 tablespoons cold water 
</P>
<P>
 To mix dough by hand, combine flour, salt and baking powder in medium mixing 
bowl. Stir well to mix. Add butter pieces and toss once or twice to coat. 
</P>
<P>
 Use hands or pastry blender to cut butter into dry ingredients in tiny pieces, 
continuously pinching and squeezing butter into dry ingredients. Be careful to 
keep mixture uniform by occasionally reaching down to bottom of bowl and mixing 
all ingredients evenly together. 
</P>
<P>
 Continue process until mixture resembles coarse-ground cornmeal and no large 
pieces of butter remain visible. Scatter 2 tablespoons water on mixture and 
stir gently with fork. Dough should begin holding together. If mixture still 
appears dry and crumbly, add remaining water, 1 teaspoon at time, until dough 
holds together easily. 
</P>
<P>
 To mix dough in food processor, combine flour, salt and baking powder in 
processor work bowl fitted with metal blade. Pulse 3 times at 1 second 
intervals to mix. Add butter to work bowl. Process, pulsing at 1 second 
intervals, until mixture is fine and powdery, resembles coarse-ground cornmeal 
and no large pieces of butter remain visible, about 15 pulses in all. 
</P>
<P>
 Scatter 2 tablespoons water on mixture and pulse 5 or 6 times. Dough should 
begin holding together. If mixture still appears dry and crumbly, add remaining 
water, 1 teaspoon at time, until dough holds together easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Scrape dough onto lightly floured surface and form into disk. If doubling 
recipe, form into 2 equal disks. Place dough between 2 pieces of plastic wrap 
and press into 6-inch disk. Refrigerate dough until firm, or until ready to 
use, at least 1 hour. Makes about 10 ounces of dough, enough for 1 cobbler or 
(1-crust) pie. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This cobbler may be varied with other fruit in season. Try a combination of 
pears and apples for a change.  
</P>
<P>
 APPLE AND CRANBERRY COBBLER 
</P>
<P>
 Flaky Pie Dough 
</P>
<P>
 3 pounds tart apples, peeled, cored and cut into wedges, such as Granny Smith 
</P>
<P>
 1 (12-ounce) bag fresh cranberries, rinsed, drained and picked over 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup light brown sugar, packed 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons flour 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
 Milk 
</P>
<P>
 Granulated sugar 
</P>
<P>
 Prepare and chill Flaky Pie Dough. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile prepare filling by combining apple wedges and cranberries in large 
mixing bowl. Mix brown sugar, flour and cinnamon. Toss with fruit in bowl. 
Spoon filling into 2- to 2 1/2-quart baking dish or gratin dish. Dot top of 
filling with butter. 
</P>
<P>
 For top crust roll dough on floured surface to approximate size of baking dish 
and place on filling, making sure dough touches sides of dish all around. Brush 
top with little milk and sprinkle with granulated sugar to taste. Cut several 
vent holes in crust. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake at 375 degrees until crust is well colored and filling is gently 
bubbling, about 40 minutes. Cool slightly. Serve warm or at room temperature. 
Makes 8 to 10 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You may prepare the mincemeat several weeks in advance and store tightly 
covered in the refrigerator -- it will have a better flavor after aging. Two 
types of apples, Granny Smith for texture and McIntosh for flavor, make for a 
more interesting mincemeat.  
</P>
<P>
 MINCE PIE 
</P>
<P>
 Double Flaky Pie Dough 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound Granny Smith or other tart, firm apples, peeled, halved and cored 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound McIntosh apples, peeled, halved and cored 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium lemon 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium orange 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/4 cups golden raisins 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup currants or dark raisins 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup diced candied orange peel 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup light brown sugar, packed 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup dark rum or brandy 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons white vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger 
</P>
<P>
 1 egg, well beaten with dash salt for egg wash 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons granulated sugar 
</P>
<P>
 Prepare and chill Flaky Pie Dough in 2 equal portions. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile prepare filling by grating apples coarsely by hand or in food 
processor. Place grated apples in large non-reactive saucepan. Grate zest from 
lemon and orange. Then squeeze and strain juice and add to pan. Add raisins, 
candied orange peel, brown sugar, rum, vinegar, butter, nutmeg, cinnamon, 
cloves and ginger. Stir well to mix. Bring mixture to simmer over low heat, 
stirring occasionally, and cook, stirring often, until mixture is reduced to 
thick, jam-like consistency, about 45 minutes. Cool mincemeat. 
</P>
<P>
 For bottom crust, lightly flour work surface and dough and roll 1 portion of 
dough to 12-inch disk. Fold in half and ease dough into 9-inch glass pie pan. 
Unfold dough and press firmly into pan. Trim away excess dough at edge of pan. 
Spread mincemeat evenly in crust. 
</P>
<P>
 For lattice top, lightly flour work surface and dough and roll second portion 
of dough to 9x12-inch rectangle. Cut into 12 (9x1-inch) strips. Brush strips 
with egg wash. Arrange 5 strips, equidistant from each other, on top of pie, 
allowing excess dough to hang over edge of pie. Place 5 more strips 
perpendicular to first strips. Trim away excess dough at edge and flute edge of 
pie. Brush with egg wash. Sprinkle with granulated sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake pie at 400 degrees on bottom oven rack 15 minutes. Lower temperature to 
350 degrees. Move pie to middle rack and bake pie until crust is deep golden 
and juices are just beginning to bubble up, 20 to 30 minutes longer. Cool pie 
on rack. Serve warm or at room temperature. Makes 8 servings. 
</P>
<P>

GOOD COOKING: AS EASY AS FISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABBY MANDEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many cooks still shy away from preparing fish at home. But buying fresh fish 
is not mysterious -- and cooking it is a breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh fish (and shellfish) are highly perishable and must be maintained at 
proper temperatures. In the ideal fish market, the kind where you can rely on 
the recommendations of the fishmonger, you encounter a fresh, almost sweetish 
odor when you walk in the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring a market of that quality, consider fish that was flash-frozen at sea. 
It can be of better quality than many fish sold as fresh. Also try farmed fish, 
since the shipping time is typically far less than from a fishing boat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, fish should be cooked the same day it's purchased. Flash-frozen 
fish that has thawed should not be frozen again. 
</P>

<P>
 This simple, comforting chowder is a most delicious focus for an informal fall 
lunch or supper. Any mild skinless fillets will work well in this recipe.  
</P>
<P>
 CHUNKY FISH CHOWDER 
</P>
<P>
 2 thick slices lean applewood-smoked bacon, cut into 1/4-inch dice 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon butter  
</P>
<P>
 1 large onion, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 2 stalks celery, diced 
</P>
<P>
 5 small red potatoes, not peeled, cut into 1/4-inch dice 
</P>
<P>
 1 (8-ounce) bottle clam juice 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup water 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground nutmeg 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups milk (2% or regular) 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons cornstarch mixed with 2 tablespoons milk 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup corn kernels (cut off cob, frozen or canned, well drained) 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound skinless, firm-fleshed, freshwater fish fillets, such as pike or 
whitefish, cut into 1/2-inch chunks 
</P>
<P>
 In 2-quart saucepan, cook bacon over medium-high heat until crisp, about 2 
minutes, stirring often. Add butter. When hot, add onion and celery. Cook until 
onion is tender, about 4 minutes, stirring often. Add potatoes, clam juice, 
water, salt, nutmeg and pepper. Bring to boil. Simmer, covered, until potatoes 
are tender, about 20 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 Add milk, cornstarch mixture and corn. Cook gently until hot and slightly 
thickened, about 6 minutes, stirring often. Do not let chowder boil. Adjust 
seasonings to taste. Can be made 2 days ahead to this point and refrigerated. 
This chowder does not freeze successfully.  
</P>
<P>
 To serve, gently reheat chowder until hot, but not boiling. Add fish. Cook 
until fish is opaque, about 1 to 2 minutes. Adjust seasonings to taste. Serve 
hot. Makes about 4 servings.

 These crisp, light-tasting fillets are easy to prepare, even though they 
require last-minute cooking. The club soda (or sparkling mineral water) gives 
this thin batter a delicate crunch. Serve these fillets with shoestring 
potatoes or roasted herbed small red potatoes and creamed spinach.  
</P>
<P>

GARDEN FRESH: OL' CHICORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Belgian endive isn't an endive at all, it's a nearly wild sort of chicory 
known as witloof. This luxury bit doesn't exist in nature -- or if it does, 
it's by accident. Actually, we can thank an accident for the pleasure of these 
vegetables.  
</P>
<P>
 But which accident?  
</P>
<P>
 The first story has a Belgian farmer throwing some chicory roots into a dark 
stable (this is doubtless a fable). Weeks later, he stumbles over plump shoots, 
layers of thin crisp leaves that were whiter than celery's. He tastes: the 
leaves have a delicate slightly bitter flavor. The Belgian endive industry is 
born. 
</P>
<P>
 The second story involves the head gardener of a botanical garden in Brussels. 
Wanting more greens for winter salads, he lifts some chicory roots, cuts off 
most of the leaves (common practice when transplanting), and sets them in a 
sheltered spot. He is astonished when he comes across them a few weeks later 
that rather than the burst of green leaves they'd produced in summer, the roots 
have given him shoots that resemble elongated crocus buds. The Belgian endive 
industry is born. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You notice both stories begin with the roots of the plant. That's because what 
we call Belgian endive comes from a plant's second growth. The first time 
around, the plant resembles short romaine lettuce or a dandelion, according to 
the strain. (In fact, in gardening language, these shoots are called chicons , 
the French term for romaine lettuce.) The leaves can be exceedingly bitter. But 
the second time around, a Cinderella of a shoot emerges, fragile and exquisite. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Belgian endive enjoyed in this country -- expensive items -- come from 
their native land. But you can harvest shoots for a tiny expense, pristine 
fresh, a garden adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 Timing for sowing seeds of witloof chicory is crucial. Sown too soon, the 
plants flower, make seeds, and are prematurely finished. Where winters are 
mild, sow seeds in the garden in late summer. Where winters are cold, sow seeds 
indoors in May and transplant outdoors after frost.  
</P>
<P>
 Give plants full sun except where summers are ferocious -- there, provide 
shade in the heat of the day. The soil must be loose and rich. You can also 
grow witloof chicory in two-gallon containers filled with three parts potting 
mix and one part compost. Keep soil/soil mix moist all summer long. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In fall, when nights approach freezing -- or, lacking frost, when you can feel 
the roots are about eight inches long -- gently pull plants up. The roots will 
look like parsnips and should be at least 1 1/2 inches wide at the top. Trim 
leafy tops to an inch and trim off any scruffy root tips. This way, the roots 
can be stored through much of winter in a cold place in sand or ashes kept 
moist, and you can grow them into Belgian endive when desired.  
</P>
<P>
 To get the same sleek chicons you find at the market, you must grow the shoots 
in a box, cheek by jowl, buried in soil. However, Witloof Improved and Turbo 
Hybrid are strains that produce tight heads with no soil on top. For variety, 
Witloof Robin emerges pale pink. Chicons are most easily grown by planting 
three to five roots in a nine-inch pot, covering it with another pot that has 
its drainage hole plugged so no light can squeak through. Keep the pot between 
50 degrees and 60 degrees in as humid a place as you've got, and don't let the 
soil dry out.  
</P>
<P>
 It will take at least three weeks -- the strain of seeds and your growing 
circumstances make timing unpredictable. Harvest when the chicons are four to 
five inches tall, cutting it off at half an inch. Replant the root and grow as 
before -- you'll get another chicon , though it will be lower in quality. You 
can even try for a third and fourth. Once cut, chicons are perishable, so it's 
best to harvest just before serving. However, you can keep them crisp, pale and 
fresh for a couple of days in the refrigerator in a plastic food bag inside a 
brown paper bag, the top folded down to keep out light. 
</P>
<P>
 You know how delectable Belgian endive is in a salad. I can't imagine a finer 
foil for sunny gold olive oil and California lemon juice than Belgian endive 
sliced lengthwise in half. Chicons add texture to any mixed salad -- marvelous 
how the leaves are at once crunchy and silky. * 
</P>
<P>
 But have you cooked Belgian endive? Prepared with tender loving care, its 
brisk taste when raw becomes subtle and complex, a blend of cooked romaine 
lettuce and spring cabbage with a suspicion of leeks woven through. Nothing 
bitter about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless they've been buried in earth, don't rinse the chicons -- the leaves are 
so delicate they can bruise with handling. Cut with a stainless steel or silver 
knife. Some recipes ask you to half-cook the chicons before preparing them. 
Don't. That diminishes their flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 A classic French way with these lovely shoots is to roast them whole in a 
covered dish moistened with butter or mild oil in a 325-degree oven. They'll 
turn gold and be delectable, although considerably wizened. It takes a long 
hour to be tender. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd rather gently cook the chicons in a little butter in a covered skillet. 
The leaves exude tasty juices and the cooking time for a whole chicon is only 
about 10 minutes -- less, of course, when it's sliced. Season with salt, pepper 
and chervil or parsley and serve as you would any green vegetable. You can 
puree the cooked leaves with milk or half-and-half and thicken with sieved 
cooked potato to make a gorgeous soup. Or you can wrap a whole cooked chicon in 
a thin slice of ham, nap with a creamy sauce, sprinkle with cheese, and bake 
until bubbly. Any recipe for cooked lettuces or leeks can be adapted to Belgian 
endive. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One more thing. Do let a few plants stay whole over winter. Next summer, 
you'll have inch-wide single petaled flowers as a reward, the most azure in the 
garden.

 This is a superb dish for company. Though it appears and tastes rich, the 
Belgian endive, salmon and scallops are so low in calories and fat that most of 
us can afford the luscious sauce. Still, if your crowd is bent on leanness, 
omit the salmon and use all scallops and replace the half-and-half with milk.  
</P>
<P>
 The mixture can be served over brown rice -- its nutty flavor and chewy 
texture are a good complement. However, the mix of coral, pale yellow and ivory 
spilling from a puff pastry shell is wonderfully elegant (dough for puff pastry 
shells are in the market's freezer case).  
</P>
<P>
 For a special dinner party, offer bowls of Greek olives, branches of fennel 
and leafy red radishes with drinks. For the first course, there's a light 
consomme brightened with tomato puree and garnished with a small dice of 
pimento. Since the main dish contains the requisite vegetable, fish and starch, 
all that's needed is a baguette of French bread and perhaps tiny cornichon 
pickles. We drink our favorite Chardonnay or Chablis of the moment. To follow, 
there's refreshing watercress salad and some sort of crumbly veined cheese. For 
dessert, peeled slices of navel oranges sprinkled with orange flower water and 
garnished with curls of their finely shredded zest -- small crisp almond 
macaroons on the side.  
</P>
<P>
 SALMON, SCALLOPS AND BELGIAN ENDIVE 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound (1 inch-thick) salmon steak 
</P>
<P>
 2 pounds Belgian endive 
</P>
<P>
 5 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground white pepper 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound frozen scallops, preferably small, half thawed, include thawing juices 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup half-and-half  
</P>
<P>
 5 tablespoons all-purpose flour  
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon leaves  
</P>
<P>
 Skin and bone salmon. Cut into 1-inch cubes. This may be done several hours in 
advance and then refrigerate salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before cooking, wipe endive clean with damp soft kitchen cloth. Then trim 
root end. Slice endive crosswise 5/8-inch thick, keeping sections intact. 
</P>
<P>
 In large heavy stainless or nonstick skillet, melt 3 1/2 tablespoons butter. 
Add endive. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring with wooden spoon until most 
pieces are coated with butter. Season to taste with salt and white pepper. 
Cover, turn heat to low. Cook, stirring once or twice, until tender-crisp, 
about 6 minutes. Turn into bowl. Stir in lemon juice. Cover and reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Without rinsing skillet, add 1 tablespoon oil and warm over medium-high heat. 
Add scallops and salmon. Saute, stirring frequently with wooden spoon, until 
salmon chunks are thoroughly opaque and scallops are cooked, 5 to 6 minutes. 
Add to endive. Again, don't rinse skillet. 
</P>
<P>
 To make sauce, drain endive-fish juices into pint measure. Add half and half 
to make 2 cups. In skillet melt 2 tablespoons butter with 1 tablespoon oil over 
medium heat. Whisk in flour. Cook over low heat 2 minutes, whisking frequently. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Remove from heat. Very slowly add half-and-half and juices to paste, whisking 
until smooth after each addition. Do not rush or there will be lumps. Return to 
medium heat and whisk until sauce simmers and thickens. Add contents of bowl. 
Stir gently with large rubber spatula until blended. Bring to simmer over 
medium heat, stirring frequently. Season to taste with salt and white pepper. 
</P>
<P>
 Serve at once in puff pastry shells or over brown rice. Garnish with tarragon. 
Makes 8 servings.

 DEAR SOS: My husband and I had a fabulous fresh raspberry tart at Mona Lisa 
Cafe in Santa Barbara. Can you help with a recipe? 
</P>
<P>
 -- JAN 
</P>
<P>
 DEAR JAN: The Mona Lisa Cafe provided us with this recipe, which other readers 
will enjoy, particularly at this time of year. The highly perishable but 
delicious mascarpone , a sweet, Italian creamy cheese used in desserts, is 
available at Italian markets, gourmet cheese shops and many supermarkets. This 
tart would be wonderful to top off Thanksgiving dinner or any holiday meal. 
MONA LISA CAFE RASPBERRY TART 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups mascarpone cheese 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup sugar 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Baked Tart Shell 
</P>
<P>
 2 1/2 pints raspberries or strawberries 
</P>
<P>
 3 ounces white chocolate 
</P>
<P>
 In medium bowl of mixer combine mascarpone and sugar until smooth. Add sour 
cream and zest and mix until creamy. Spoon filling into cooled Baked Tart 
Shell, distributing evenly. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrange raspberries in concentric circles to cover all filling. Or, if 
desired, leave 1/2-inch border around outer edge and with additional mascarpone 
cream, pipe scallops or rosettes around edge.  
</P>
<P>
 Chop white chocolate and place in stainless steel bowl. Cover with plastic 
wrap. Place 1-inch water in saucepan. Bring to boil, turn off heat and place 
bowl of white chocolate on top. When chocolate begins to melt, remove from pan 
and mix until smooth.  
</P>
<P>
 Pour into cone of parchment paper or squeeze bottle with piping nozzle and 
pipe lines about 1/4-inch apart across tart. Repeat to form lattice. Chill 1 
hour. Cut and serve. Makes 6 to 8 servings. 
</P>

AN EARLY THANKSGIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN NATHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While most Americans will sit down to a Thanksgiving meal on Thursday, Nov. 
24, Dr. Ella Sekatau and her tribe of Narragansett Indians celebrated their 
Thanksgiving at an Indian Harvest festival meal on Oct. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact, we have a thanksgiving harvest festival every 28 days or so," says 
Sekatau, the medicine woman for her southern New England tribe. "Our people 
have been doing this for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years." 
</P>
<P>
 Other such harvest meals include a spring strawberry festival at corn planting 
time, a summer green bean and corn festival when the first squashes, string 
beans and corn are ready for eating, and in August, a green corn festival in 
which fresh fish are baked over seaweed and coals on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 At the October Thanksgiving meal, Sekatau, her seven children, 26 
grandchildren and other tribe members sit down, like other Americans, to a meal 
of turkey, cranberry sauce and sweet potatoes. But they gather as a community 
to eat in the Inland Long House where, in past times, several families settled 
together for the cold winter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditionally the October Thanksgiving meal took place after the hunting 
parties had brought in fresh meat, and the fruit, vegetables and fish were 
dried and stored for the winter," she says. "At all these festivals the Indians 
expressed thanksgiving to the Great Spirit and the Earth Mother." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to enjoying the meal together, adults and children dress in 
deerskin clothes and perform Narragansett dances around an outdoor fire. As 
medicine woman, Sekatau ("Firefly," "Song of Wine," "She Who Is in Mourning" 
are her translated Narragansett names) stands in the center of the dancers. Her 
face is decorated with white and red theatrical paint over her nose and under 
her eyes representing the spiritual and the living worlds. The black tattoo on 
her left cheek represents her turtle clan, a sign of one of the Narragansett 
royal families. She wears a copper bracelet, American glass beads, Indian 
acorns and a black wampum (quahog) necklace. An eagle and a duck feather 
protrude from behind her black, braided hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in South County, R.I., Sekatau spends most of her time teaching the 
language, arts and culture of her heritage to thousands of children each year 
in southern New England. 
</P>
<P>
 "My purpose is to re-educate Americans about the cultures existing in North 
America in the early 1600s and 1700s," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The month prior to Thanksgiving she is especially busy helping schoolchildren 
better understand what the first Thanksgiving of the Pilgrims was really like. 
The Pilgrims of the 17th Century first learned the foodways in their new land 
from the Native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Narragansett or Bay Indians," adds Sekatau, "date back thousands of years 
in South County." Today, about 3,000 recognized Narragansetts live in southern 
New England. 
</P>
<P>
 For the early Indians, dinner was the only formal meal of the day. Instead, 
they ate whenever they were hungry -- savoring newly picked berries in the 
spring, munching on dried fruit and vegetables in the winter or tasting the 
stew or fish chowder nearly always cooking in the fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
 During the evening the entire family ate together out of a communal bowl. Each 
person would use his own scoop-like spoon made from hard wood or an animal 
horn. First the father, then the grandparents, then the children, and finally 
the mother scooped their food. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to Roger Williams in his "Key into the Language of North America," 
written in 1643, the food was so abundant in the unpolluted waters of 
Narragansett Bay and off Cape Cod that Indian women merely waded out to gather 
lobsters, clams, oysters and quahogs. The story goes that the Pilgrims were so 
shocked when a green lobster emerged bright red from boiling water that they 
called it "the Devils' doin'." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pilgrims also ate eels, mackerel, cod, herring, haddock, flounder, 
sturgeon and salmon -- all of which were plentiful. Shellfish flavored their 
food, which was otherwise relatively bland by our standards. In winter they ate 
smoked dried fish unless someone was industrious enough to dig a hole in the 
ice to catch a fresh fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of their other foods included turkey, venison, seal, pigeon, duck, 
raccoons, rabbit, skunk cabbage, wild rice, Jerusalem artichokes, cucumbers, 
melons, corn, beans and squash. The Indians called the last-named the "three 
sisters" since they were planted at the same time. The beans would wind their 
stalks around the corn and the squash would run between the corn hills. 
Strawberries, cranberries, beach plums, swamp apples, grapes and maple sugar 
were all plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
 With no olive or vegetable oil, the Indians used porcupine, bear, black walnut 
and seal oil for cooking. They even used seal oil in summer as a protection 
against sunburn and mosquitoes, and in winter as an insulator against cold. 
Spices native to the area included wild pepperseeds, wild onion and bay leaf. 
Sassafras and pumpkin seed teas were considered sure cures for kidney 
infections, while cranberry juice, and rosehip and pine needle teas provided 
the necessary Vitamin C in their diet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of all these foods by far the most important to the Indians were corn and 
beans. Women scraped the kernels from the cobs with their fingers and 
bonescrapers, and then ground the corn into meal. They also parched the corn in 
ashes to make nokehick (pronounced no-ki-hick). Carried in corn pouches on long 
journeys, the corn formed a kind of patty when cold water was added. A person 
could subsist on three spoonfuls of nokehick per day when necessary, although 
when the men went hunting they carried a pouch containing dehydrated fruit, 
dried venison, huckleberries and nokehick.  
</P>
<P>
 Out of cornmeal they made Indian pudding and Johnnycakes. With no leavening 
agents, the cakes were cooked on flat stones and were similar to flat, 
unleavened bread. Somehow, through the years, the English, perhaps confusing 
nokehick with these cakes, called them "journey cakes," which became 
Johnnycakes. 
</P>
<P>
 At the harvest festival, Sekatau dips her Johnnycake, as we would crackers, 
into quahog chowder. In addition, she substitutes them for bread crumbs in her 
recipe for oyster stuffing for turkey. Her menu often includes squash dishes 
and Johnnycakes in which she uses cream, butter and salt, items omitted in 
traditional recipes. JOHNNYCAKES 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup white stone-ground cornmeal 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons maple syrup 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup boiling water 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup medium cream or half and half 
</P>
<P>
 Corn oil and butter for frying 
</P>
<P>
 In bowl mix together cornmeal, salt and maple syrup. Add boiling water and mix 
well. Thin down batter with cream. Batter should be thick and not runny. 
</P>
<P>
 Drop batter by tablespoonfuls onto medium-hot and well-greased griddle or 
skillet. Let stand 6 minutes. Turn Johnnycakes over and continue cooking about 
5 minutes more. Makes 8 to 10 Johnnycakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Note : Indians also prepared Johnnycakes substituting 1 cup clams or quahogs 
and juice for syrup and cream. NARRAGANSETT OYSTER STUFFING 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound pork sausage or other type 
</P>
<P>
 4 large onions 
</P>
<P>
 2 batches Johnnycakes, or 5 cups crumbled corn bread, or 4 cups cooked wild or 
brown rice, or 1 pound boiled Jerusalem artichokes, cut up 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound fresh grapes, or 1 cup raisins 
</P>
<P>
 2 unpeeled diced apples 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup cranberries 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 teaspoons seafood seasoning or to taste 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups oysters with juice 
</P>
<P>
 Dice sausage and brown with onions in heavy saucepan over medium heat, about 5 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mix together Johnnycakes or selected filling with grapes, apples, cranberries 
and seafood seasoning. Mix well. Add oysters with juice. 
</P>
<P>
 Either stuff turkey with filling or cook in covered flame-proof casserole in 
pan of water alongside turkey, basting occasionally with turkey drippings. 
Makes enough stuffing for 1 (20-pound) turkey. ROASTED ACORN OR BUTTERNUT 
SQUASH 
</P>
<P>
 3 acorn or butternut squashes 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup brown sugar or maple sugar, loosely packed  
</P>

TENDERS MERCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced recently with making dinner -- and no plan how to do it -- I searched 
the refrigerator, then the pantry. This is what I found: One package of chicken 
tenders, a few sprigs of basil sitting in a glass of water and covered with a 
plastic food bag, a lemon and a half bunch of broccoli. In the pantry, I found 
my usual staples of olive oil and rice. I decided that these few ingredients 
could make a decent meal. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm never very daring when it comes to dessert, but the pint of ice cream and 
bag of pecans in the freezer triggered the memory of a favorite sundae I loved 
as a college kid: ice cream, pecans and maple syrup. In the refrigerator, I 
found a bottle of maple syrup -- and a jar of applesauce. Oh, yes! Warm 
applesauce with vanilla ice cream melting down would be perfect with the 
crunchy pecans and the rich maple syrup. 
</P>
<P>
 Gremolata is a mixture of finely chopped parsley, lemon and garlic used as a 
seasoning in the classic Italian dish of slow-cooked veal shanks called osso 
buco. I like the fresh clean taste of gremolata and use it often to season 
soups or to sprinkle over baked fish fillets. It added just the right amount of 
zing to the sauteed chicken tenders. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Chicken tenders are the thick strip of chicken removed from the underside of 
each half chicken breast when the breasts are made into cutlets. I used to call 
these "fillets" when I removed them myself. But they are now conveniently 
packaged and sold already separated from the chicken breasts. If unavailable, 
substitute 1/2-inch-wide strips of boneless and skinless chicken breast. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 If basil is unavailable, use parsley to make the gremolata.  
</P>
<P>
 CHICKEN TENDERS WITH BASIL GREMOLATA 
</P>
<P>
 1 garlic clove, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1 strip lemon zest, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup lightly packed fresh basil leaves 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 (16-ounce) package chicken tenders 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
 Make gremolata by placing garlic, lemon zest and basil on cutting board and 
chop until very fine. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in large nonstick skillet until hot enough to sizzle when drop of 
water is added. Add chicken tenders, few at time, and adjust heat so that 
chicken will cook steadily. Arrange chicken in single layer. Season to taste 
with salt and pepper. Cook chicken until lightly browned on 1 side, about 3 
minutes. Turn chicken over and cook until lightly browned on other side, about 
1 minute. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add gremolata and cook, 
stirring, 1 minute. Stir in lemon juice. Makes 4 servings. PIGNOLI-RICE PILAF 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons pignoli (pine nuts) 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup chopped onion 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup imported or American basmati-style rice 
</P>
<P>
 1 (13 3/4-ounce) can reduced-sodium chicken broth 
</P>
<P>
 Toast pignoli in small skillet over low heat, stirring constantly, until 
lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine olive oil and onion in 10-inch skillet with tight-fitting lid. Cook, 
stirring, over low heat, until onion is golden, about 5 minutes. Stir in rice 
and cook 1 minute. Add broth and bring to boil. 
</P>
<P>
 Stir once. Cover and cook without stirring until broth is absorbed and rice is 
tender and dry, about 15 minutes. Sprinkle with toasted pine nuts. Makes 4 
servings. WARM APPLESAUCE AND MAPLE SYRUP SUNDAES 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup broken pecans or walnuts 
</P>
<P>
 1 (16-ounce) jar applesauce or homemade 
</P>
<P>
 1 pint vanilla ice cream 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup maple syrup 
</P>
<P>
 Heat pecans in small skillet over low heat just until toasted, about 3 
minutes. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat applesauce in saucepan or in glass measuring cup in microwave just until 
warm, about 2 minutes. Divide applesauce among 4 dessert bowls. Add 1 scoop 
vanilla ice cream to each bowl. Top with toasted nuts and drizzle with maple 
syrup, dividing evenly. Makes 4 servings.

TURKEY HERESY? GUMBO INSTEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEV BENNETT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanksgiving turkey reminds me of the television commercial in which people 
complain to the store manager that the frozen dinner he stocks provides too 
much food for one person. He responds by generously offering to come to dinner 
with his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as this particular brand of frozen dinner isn't designed to be skimpy, 
neither is a turkey. Anything short of eight guests guarantees leftovers. 
</P>
<P>
 You do have an alternative to setting more plates at the dinner table. Use 
turkey parts, buying only as much as you'll need. Instead of bringing a whole 
bird to the table, present a delicious turkey gumbo as the entree. The turkey 
flavor and essence are in the dish and you won't have to face the carcass for 
the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey gumbo uses smoked turkey drumstick as the base. It should be available 
in supermarkets this time of the year. If not, buy about eight ounces of smoked 
turkey, cut it into cubes and follow the directions. Unlike turkey, this gumbo 
improves in flavor on the second day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This recipes makes two to four servings, depending upon what other dishes are 
on the menu. I'd recommend corn bread or muffins; a salad of lettuce, walnuts, 
goat cheese; cranberry chutney or whole berry cranberry sauce; and pecan tarts 
for dessert. TURKEY GUMBO 
</P>
<P>
 4 slices bacon 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups okra, caps trimmed off, sliced into 1-inch pieces 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

 1 celery stalk, sliced 1/2-inch thick 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons flour 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups chicken broth 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or more to taste 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon crushed, dried thyme 
</P>
<P>
 1/8 teaspoon ground sage 
</P>
<P>
 1 bay leaf 
</P>
<P>
 1 (1-pound) smoked turkey drumstick 
</P>

 1 cup canned, diced tomatoes, or 1 large, peeled and diced tomato 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Fry bacon in Dutch oven until well-browned. Drain bacon on paper towel-lined 
plate, then crumble bacon. 
</P>
<P>
 Add okra to bacon fat and saute over high heat 2 to 3 minutes. Add onion, 
garlic and celery and. Saute over medium-high heat 5 minutes. Stir in flour and 
cook to paste. Stir in chicken broth. Stir well and cook over low heat until 
smooth and slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in 1/4 teaspoon cayenne 
pepper, thyme, sage and bay leaf. Stir well. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove meat from drumstick. Discard skin. Cut meat into bite-size pieces and 
add to pan along with tomatoes and bacon. Cover and simmer 30 minutes. Adjust 
seasonings to taste. Simmer another 5 minutes to blend flavors. Remove bay 
leaf. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve over hot cooked rice. Makes 2 
to 4 servings.
