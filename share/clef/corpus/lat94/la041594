MOVIE REVIEW; A LIGHT BUT LIVELY '60S 'BACKBEAT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before the Beatles were Fab or Yellow Submarined or Maharishied, they were a 
scrounging group just like other mortal rockers. "BackBeat" deals with the 
pre-Ringo years of 1960 to mid-1962, when Pete Best was the drummer and Stu 
Sutcliffe, on and off, played bass guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 Focusing primarily on Sutcliffe, played by Stephen Dorff, and his knockabout 
friendship with Ian Hart's John Lennon, "BackBeat" keeps fuzzing our memories 
of the Beatles with lots of unfamiliar shenanigans. The effect is both 
alienating and humanizing: They don't seem to be our Beatles, and yet these 
early struggles bring them closer to us. They were people before they were pop 
icons. 
</P>
<P>
 Would "BackBeat" have the same resonance if it were about a fictitious rock 
band? It's doubtful. The film plays off our knowledge -- and ignorance -- of 
the Beatles. It doesn't go into any particular depth about the relationships 
between Sutcliffe and Lennon and the other Beatles; it gives a 
once-over-lightly view of the Liverpool and Hamburg concert scene in the early 
'60s, where most of the action takes place. Director and co-writer Iain Softley 
is mostly interested in getting across the lurching, frenetic atmosphere of 
those days, when rockers were trying out their Elvis and James Dean poses and 
Pop was just around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its flash and bite, "BackBeat" is also a fairly conventional view of 
celebrity heartbreak. The goading, teasing subtext to this film is: Just 
imagine! Sutcliffe could have been a Beatle! 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Softley tries to have it both ways. He shows us how Sutcliffe, who died from a 
brain hemorrhage in 1962 after he had already fallen out with the Beatles, was 
actually a talented painter who found fulfillment with Astrid Kirchherr (Sheryl 
Lee), the Hamburg photographer whose photographs of the group helped fix their 
"look." (The haircuts were her idea.) 
</P>
<P>
 But Softley also plays up the sad sack side of Sutcliffe's story. He coulda 
been a contenda. The doom and gloom doesn't really jibe with what we're shown 
of his life with the Beatles (or, even more, with what's been documented about 
that period). After all, Sutcliffe, as the film shows, could hardly play the 
bass or sing; he joined the group as a lark, and, as he tranced into the 
Hamburg underground of unisex pop poseurs, he lost interest in taking the 
stage. Even if Sutcliffe hadn't lost interest, Paul McCartney (played in the 
film by Gary Bakewell) wanted him gone, and even Lennon, who threatened to 
leave if Stu were dropped, finally backed down. The heartbreak scenario that 
Softley twangs in "BackBeat" is misguided. If Sutcliffe had stayed with the 
Beatles, they would not have been the Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
 The film also takes Sutcliffe a bit too mythically. Dorff has the right 
bantamweight James Dean look -- it's the look that smote Astrid at first sight 
-- but he doesn't get behind the look. Sutcliffe was a paradox: He tried on 
rebellions as a pose -- he rebelled against his middle-class home, his art 
training, his rock career. And yet, as a painter, he was the real thing, even 
though the movie conveys his artistry in the standard bio-pic way. He attacks 
his canvases with a Van Gogh-like ravenousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Sutcliffe is the film's center but he's a centerless character. He takes on 
the colorations of the surrounding scenery. When Astrid, along with her 
long-term friend and lover Klaus Voormann (Kai Weisinger), dresses him up in 
modish existential duds, he seems most alive. He strikes attitudes, and that's 
probably part of what attracted Lennon to him; Lennon was trying on attitudes 
too in those days (and later too). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The unspoken sexual tension between Sutcliffe and Lennon is also lightly 
underlined in "BackBeat." It's supposed to be the mirror image of Sutcliffe's 
love affair with Astrid but it has more passion than anything going on with his 
fraulein . Ian Hart, who also played Lennon in "The Hours and the Times," is 
phenomenal in the role; he almost makes Lennon's grasping, desperate, 
overbearing relationship with Sutcliffe come alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart's Lennon is so volatile and self-hating and self-infatuated that he seems 
to be having a wild carnal affair with himself. It's a lot more exciting than 
the confabs between Sutcliffe and Astrid, which should be creepier than they 
appear here. Astrid, in her photos, was a zonked pixie, and she merged her look 
with Sutcliffe's as they grew closer together. Their love had the element of a 
twinship fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
 Most movies about rock are such dithery jobs that "BackBeat" may seem more 
impressive than it really is. It's lively and full of good music and it plays 
around with a fascinating subject -- the Fifth Beatle and his one true love. 
But it doesn't really illuminate that subject or those years or that music. 
It's a Pop treatment of Pop.

 Happy Birthday, Sir John: British actor Sir John Gielgud celebrated his 90th 
birthday Thursday at home in his elegant 17th-Century mansion northwest of 
London. He turned down a proposed West End theatrical tribute that had included 
talk of naming a theater after him, and instead spent the day quietly with his 
longtime companion Martin Hensler. Earlier this week, Gielgud, who made his 
theatrical debut in 1921 and was knighted in 1953, said: "I'd much rather work 
and show I can still do a bit, rather than just get congratulations on the 
past. (Such congratulations) would rather sound like my obituary." Gielgud 
recently played King Lear in a new radio version of the Shakespeare play 
broadcast last Sunday by the BBC. He won an Academy Award in 1981 as the butler 
to Dudley Moore's "Arthur." POP/ROCK

 Nirvana Sales Soar: As expected, last Friday's news of Nirvana leader Kurt 
Cobain's death by a self-inflicted shotgun blast triggered a sales run on 
Nirvana's music at retail outlets across the nation. The Seattle power trio's 
"In Utero" album, released last summer, shot to No. 27 on this week's pop 
chart, selling more than 40,000 copies -- twice what it sold the previous week. 
And sales of the group's 1991 breakthrough "Nevermind" album tripled to 20,000 
units, as did sales for its first album, "Bleach," which sold 9,500 copies. 
Nirvana's "Incesticide" EP sold 8,300 copies -- quadruple what it sold the week 
before Cobain's suicide. The figures are for the week ending last Sunday, and 
reflect only those units sold during the three days immediately following news 
of Cobain's suicide. Industry insiders expect next week's Nirvana sales figures 
to jump even higher. Also expected to do well next week is the new album by 
Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, and her band Hole.

 * Justices Reject Lyric Ban: A Washington state law designed to keep children 
from buying recordings that contain "erotic" lyrics is unconstitutional because 
it infringes on the free-speech rights of adults, that state's Supreme Court 
ruled Thursday. The law was approved in 1992 but never went into effect because 
of a lawsuit filed on behalf of dozens of musicians, record companies and the 
Recording Industry Assn. of America. The law proposed that county prosecutors 
ask judges to rule on individual recordings, which would then be labeled 
"adults only" if they were found to appeal to minors' prurient interests and 
offend community standards. The court found the law unconstitutionally broad 
because distributors across the state would be subject to injunctions whenever 
a recording was challenged. Such injunctions would amount to prior restraint 
and violate the music sellers' right to due process, the court ruled.

 * Eagles to Play MTV: The Eagles will kick off their much-publicized summer 
reunion tour with two shows to be taped April 25 and 26 at Burbank's Warner

performance" will feature Glenn Frey, Don Henley, Don Felder, Joe Walsh and 
Timothy B. Schmit performing classic Eagles hits, plus some new material.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'WHITE FANG' SINKS TEETH INTO ANOTHER ADVENTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although it is difficult to imagine anyone over the age of 10 getting caught 
up in "White Fang 2: Myth of the White Wolf," it just might connect with fifth 
and sixth graders. Parents would do well to consider dropping off their 
children at the theater and picking them up later rather than submit themselves 
to this less-than-riveting sequel of the 1991 success. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethan Hawke, star of the first film, appears at the beginning to sign off, 
writing to his pal Henry (Scott Bairstow) that he's going to stay in San 
Francisco to help rebuild the city after the 1906 earthquake. Thus Henry, up in 
the Alaskan wilderness, has become master to the noble White Fang, the 
half-dog, half-wolf super-canine. In no time the young man and the animal are 
caught up in their own adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 Native Americans of the Haida Tribe are facing starvation because inexplicably 
the caribou have vanished for two years. A Haida prophecy says that a wolf will 
lead them to the caribou, and when Henry miraculously survives a near-drowning, 
the Haida insist that the spirit of White Fang, whom they presume to have 
drowned, lives on in Henry. By the time White Fang pops up, no worse for wear, 
Henry, although understandably perplexed and decidedly uncertain how he can 
help the Haida, throws in his lot with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "White Fang 2" is politically correct with a vengeance that's stultifying. 
Director Ken Olin and writer David Fallon and their crew admirably go all out 
to re-create a Haida village authentically. But the actors playing the 
principal Haida -- Charmaine Craig as a beautiful, demure Native American 
princess and Al Harrington as her wise chieftain uncle -- are burdened with 
cliched characters. 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of Henry, soon an adopted Haida, all the other whites are 
villains of the deepest dye, led by Alfred Molina's fake preacher and his 
sidekick Geoffrey Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 Righting ancient wrongs against Native Americans on the screen has solid 
educational value for youngsters, but here it's been done too obviously and too 
heavy-handedly to engage adults. On the plus side Olin makes the most of the 
film's numerous action sequences. The scenery, photographed gleamingly by Hiro 
Narita, is gorgeous, and Henry, Craig's Lily and White Fang himself are 
appealing. "White Fang 2," however, really does need John Debney's thundering 
score, to keep its exceedingly simple story pumped up. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG, for mild action violence. Times guidelines: The film is 
suitable for all but very young children.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'COPS' A SUBVERSIVE FAMILY COMEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the surface "Cops and Robbersons" is the broad-appeal family comedy it 
presents itself to be, but its subtext is gratifyingly another matter. Its 
setting is a tract of unrelenting snug blandness, and a husband and father, 
Norman Robberson (Chevy Chase), who owns one of the homes, works at an office 
of equal uniformity. No one seems very happy or connected in the Robberson 
household, but its dominant figure, Norman's wife, Helen (Dianne Wiest), 
declares with finality that "Everything is fine!" 
</P>
<P>
 Seemingly, things are soon to get spectacularly better when Jack Palance's 
crusty veteran cop Jake Stone uses the Robberson house to stake out their new 
next-door neighbor (Robert Davi), an especially lethal double-crosser dealing 
in counterfeit money. Palance's rookie partner Tony (David Barry Gray) finds 
the attraction between him and the Robbersons' high school student daughter 
(Fay Masterson) mutual, and the two young Robberson sons (Jason James Richter, 
Miko Hughes) are as in awe of Jake as their parents are. 
</P>
<P>
 It so happens that Norman has always wanted to be a cop, at least in his 
fantasies, and is such a TV cop show fanatic that when he returns a "Police 
Woman" tape to a video store, he feels compelled to point out that 11 seconds 
are missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, Norman feels that his opportunity to be a hero has arrived at last, 
but he's such a naive klutz that he very nearly destroys Jake's operation at 
the start. (Never mind that he actually uncovered some pertinent information.) 
In essence, what writer Bernie Somers, in an exceptional first-produced 
screenplay, reveals is that the arrival of Jake not only underlines Norman's 
lack of respect within his own family, but also worsens it. With his satirical 
eye for the absurdities of American middle-class life and his special awareness 
of competition, so much a part of the American character, director Michael 
Ritchie is just the man to bring out the darkest side of Somers' script with 
much compassionate humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, Ritchie has erased from Chase that easy superciliousness that can 
drive you crazy if you're not one of Chase's die-hard fans. Chase consistently 
underplays, and gains immeasurably from doing so. His Norman longs for 
recognition but never grovels for it, although he may pursue it recklessly. He 
is a nice, decent guy who deserves better from his family, who loves him but 
doesn't pay much attention to him, especially his children. He's an office 
worker who has consciously or otherwise deferred running the family and the 
home to his wife. Well-meaning, she has taken on the role with missionary, 
perfectionist zeal. Helen can be a nit-picker, but Wiest shows us that she's 
really a good woman who's fundamentally devoted to her husband as well as her 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 So often cast as the villain throughout his long career, Palance has emerged 
in recent years as a hilarious comedian, starting with "Bagdad Cafe" and his 
Oscar-winning turn in "City Slickers." Jake may have a heart of gold lurking 
behind his tough-guy stance, but Palance plays his predicament in holding the 
Robberson family at bay while doing his job of surveillance with a comic 
gruffness that forestalls undue sentimentality. Jake is a showy, funny role and 
Palance really runs with it. So does Davi with his bad guy, who can be 
amusingly, disarmingly likable. The film's young actors provide winning support 
for the film's top-lined veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameraman Gerry Fisher has brought to "Cops and Robbersons" a deceptively 
bright, shiny look that's just right to set off the film's darker 
undercurrents. The great thing is that the film doesn't cop out at the finish: 
It's Helen, after all, who keeps her cool in a crisis, and when finally Norman 
wins his family's attention and concern, it's a display of compassion and 
congratulations for heroics attempted rather than accomplished. There's a tinge 
of sadness amid the laughter in this surprisingly subversive family comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG for mild violence, language and some comic nudity. Times 
guidelines: It is actually solid, surprisingly thought-provoking family fare, 
though it does include flashes of bare buttocks.

THEATER REVIEW; TWISTED, FUNNY VISIONS OF REALITY IN 'POT MOM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD STAYTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Has Orson Welles been reincarnated as Justin Tanner? Such psychedelic 
questions hover like hallucinations above Tanner's hilariously dysfunctional 
"Pot Mom" at the Cast Theatre. The twentysomething playwright-director's ninth 
play is a stoned parody of contemporary California suburbia that explores the 
blurred boundaries between television fantasy and daily reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pot Mom" rhymes with "sitcom" for a reason. Marijuana smoking becomes a sly, 
hip comment on the genre distorting American experience like pot distorts 
perception. Tanner's generation is neither X nor baby buster nor grunge -- it's 
bemused. No accident that wunderkind Tanner is currently adapting "Dazed and 
Confused," the cult film about 1970s teen-age Angst , for the USA Network. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is it an accident that the play begins with the soundtrack of an "I Love 
Lucy" rerun in a typical network series living room. If Lucy were modeled to 
today's housewife, then she'd probably resemble non -working-class mother Patty 
(Ellen Ratner). This mother barely copes, while constantly smoking joints and 
trying to decide who to kick out -- her grown-up kids or her lover. But with 
the end of unemployment, can Patty risk losing her boyfriend Richard's (Jon 
Palmer) steady income from driving produce trucks? 
</P>
<P>
 More significant, Richard has a greenhouse in the back yard that's a jungle of 
marijuana. Without the promise of such green grass, Patty might self-destruct. 
So she leans on her best friend and neighbor, Michelle (Elizabeth Ruscio), a 
contemporary Ethel Mertz. Stoned and munching on cold Pop Tarts (the toaster 
broke), mellow Michelle conceives her own plan: "I'm gonna get rid of that jerk 
that's been living with me ." 
</P>
<P>
 Patty's son Troy (French Stewart) works part time at the mall's 4-Plex 
cinemas: "Yes, I'm an usher, but I want to direct." Jealous sisters Lisa 
(Laurel Green) and Lorraine (Dana Schwartz) only stop feuding while scheming to 
drive their mother's control-freak boyfriend out of the house. Wanna-be rockers 
Gene (Gill Gayle) and Nick (Jon Amirkhan) roll into the living room like lost 
extras from "Laverne & Shirley," needing fuel before competing in the annual 
"Battle of the Bands." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tanner directs his ensemble with seamless naturalism, shrewdly allowing 
over-the-top farcical incidents to be heard off-stage but not seen. The gifted 
cast delivers the marvelously funny dialogue with delirious docudrama timing. 
Especially noteworthy are Ruscio's tour-de-force disintegration and Ratner's 
ditsy Mother Courage, whose teamwork deserves future drama awards. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't expect Welles' film noir classic "Touch of Evil." Tanner isn't 
drilling for deep meaning in "Pot Mom." Conflicts get manufactured and resolved 
in the arbitrary manner of sitcoms. There's more breadth than depth, yet it's 
brilliantly shallow. Tanner still hasn't come of age as a playwright, and the 
best is yet to come from this gifted, consummate youth of the theater.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'NAKED IN NEW YORK': SIMPLE PLEASURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dan Algrant, making his feature-film debut as co-writer and director in "Naked 
in New York," doesn't try to wow the audience with a lot of 
semi-autobiographical Angst. He's not big on wow in general. He's the kind of 
filmmaker who works in safe, methodical strokes, and the safeness is both 
calming and clotting in a filmmaker so new. He's made a friendly, 
disconcertingly tame debut movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Algrant may be short on Angst but his film still carries the flavor of 
something closer to his concerns than the latest grosses. It's about what 
happens when two college lovers, Jake (Eric Stoltz) and Joanne (Mary-Louise 
Parker), live together in Cambridge, Mass., after graduation and then apart 
when their careers conflict. He's an aspiring young playwright -- aren't all 
young playwrights in the movies aspiring? -- who makes the move to New York 
City when one of his plays is produced Off-Broadway. She's a photographer who 
stays behind in order to work for a well-connected gallery owner (played by 
Timothy Dalton, who has the kind of brittle British diction that really 
deserves a hearing on "Star Trek: The Next Generation" opposite Patrick 
Stewart's). 
</P>
<P>
 The film's time scheme, ranging from Jake's voice-over reminiscences in the 
present to flashbacks of his loopy childhood with his single mom (Jill 
Clayburgh) to places in between, is complicated but lucid. We're supposed to 
regard Jake's coming of age as a kind of tall-tale jaunt. He's an artist 
because he embraces his foolhardiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoltz has a shaggy grace and a couple of his confrontations with Parker's 
Joanne have the tang of real spats. Their living-apart situation, with Jake 
periodically calling her in moments of distress and getting her answering 
machine instead, have a familiar horror. Algrant stages a good arty party 
scene, and there's a sexual moment between Jake and his best friend Chris 
(Ralph Macchio) that is blessedly understated where leers might have 
substituted. Famous artist celebs like William Styron and Arthur Penn and Eric 
Bogosian keep popping up, and it's fun to see them playacting in their element. 
</P>
<P>
 But the film is stolen by Tony Curtis, as Jake's Off-Broadway producer, and 
Kathleen Turner, as the soap-opera diva who is all wrong for Jake's play -- and 
of course is cast in the lead. These two performers dig into their parts with 
such campy relish that they seem to be having an actor's holiday. (This is what 
can happen when two studio-savvy players have a fling in low-budget land.) They 
burst the film's carefully stitched seams, and the bursting is all for the 
best.

THEATER BEAT: NOISE WITHIN MEETS 'ALL'S WELL' CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD STAYTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "All's Well That Ends Well" sounds like a sunny proverb promising light 
comedy, but Shakespeare's most optimistic title belongs to one of his most 
pessimistic plays. It is also among the Bard's most difficult and least popular 
works, exiled alongside the other dreaded "problem plays." Fearful of 
alienating audiences, theaters generally focus on the love-conquers-all fairy 
tale surface of "All's Well." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, A Noise Within goes where other theaters fear to tread. 
Glendale's gifted classical repertory company boldly embraces Shakespeare's 
ironic ambiguities and dark cynicism, steeping Shakespeare's themes in 
Victorian sexual repression. It's an "All's Well" that plays well and ends with 
a modern portrait of a marriage made in hell. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Michael Winters offers provocative interpretations of the furtive 
flight from love by anti-hero Bertram (a splendidly subtle Steven Flynn) and 
the amorous pursuit by Helena (a radiant Ann Marie Lee). Bertram's confession 
that "I cannot love her" grows more sinister than an aristocrat's mere 
rejection of a commoner -- here it's homosexual panic. His cruel rejection of 
devoted Helena, coupled with his preference for army buddies, makes Bertram's 
motivations suspect. Then his devious seduction of a widow's daughter (an 
impressive Ann Marie Lee) is accompanied by a sadistic command: " . . . give 
thyself unto my sick desires." 
</P>
<P>
 Not least among the many motivational problems inherent within "All's Well" is 
Helena's obsession for such a liar. "Lust doth play with what it loathes," 
Helena shudders, yet is desperate to sacrifice herself to such loathing. 
Feminist scholars have made much of her character's masculine qualities and 
wiles, necessary to a woman's rise in a sexist society. Despite Helena's 
angelic pose, she must resort to aggressive, unorthodox deceptions to achieve 
her questionable victory. By the "happy-ever-after" ending, she's "become" 
royalty; but her prince resembles the "master-mistress" of the sonnets "who, 
moving others, is himself as stone." 
</P>
<P>
 Except for a protracted farcical sequence when Bertram's constant companion 
Parolles (an appropriately over-the-top Robert Pescovitz) is "unmasked," 
director Winters and company maintain a beautifully somber tone. Fallen leaves 
litter the stage, symbolic of the Victorian morality denying erotic freedoms. 
Rand Ryan's lucid lighting and Norman Mamey's elegiac score provide haunting 
counterpoint to the melancholy struggles. The notorious bed-trick scene, 
discreetly off-stage in Shakespeare's text, gets choreographed as a mute dance 
of the sexes, a menage-a-trois aching with sorrow and compassion. 
</P>
<P>
 * "All's Well That Ends Well," A Noise Within, 234 S. Brand Blvd., Glendale. 
In repertory; call (818) 546-1924 for schedule. Ends May 15. $15. Running time: 
3 hours, 15 minutes. Delivering the 'Canned Goods' 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a chance that Los Angeles Theatre Center's founding company did not 
go bankrupt and vacate the Spring Street arts complex in 1991? Eerie deja vu 
permeates "Canned Goods," a project of the Performing Arts Division of the 
Cultural Affairs Department, now at LATC's small Theatre 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Silas Jones' ambitious, impressive, heartfelt report from the battlefields of 
South-Central resembles a predictable after-school special -- at first. Midway 
through the docudrama about an Asian American grocer's retirement, theatrical 
ghosts begin populating the LATC stage. Such ghosts previously inhabited 
post-modernist plays that once dominated the former tenant's stages. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, an African American cowboy (portrayed with convincing heroism by 
Troy Anthony Cephers) in pristine white Western gear is speaking in a John 
Wayne twang while drawing his six-gun, reminding us of LATC's 1985 opening 
production, an all-black version of Sam Shepard's "Fool for Love." An ancestral 
ghost prowls the grocery, cursing the day she left Korea, reminiscent of David 
Henry Hwang's one-acts. A prostitute named Buddha Baby (a harrowing Fran 
DeLeon) is seen ritually casting spells, much the way heroines behaved in 
LATC-prodigy Reza Abdoh's epics. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, "Canned Goods" is no polite nod to multiculturalism. Jones, 
director Darryl Hill and company have embarked on a challenging presentation 
that refuses to reduce our city's complex crises into a simple formula. They 
defiantly reject politically correct liberalism and pious generalities, instead 
forcing us to examine the urban subtext. 
</P>
<P>
 If a grocer shoots a customer, or a customer kills a clerk, can it all be 
reduced to a police report? Only in tabloid journalism and the nightly news. 
And so effects are employed from cutting-edge American dramatists -- Suzan-Lori 
Parks, Abdoh, Jose Rivera, Regina Taylor. And so we experience a shock of 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes "Canned Goods" work so well is that such hallucinatory visions are 
dramatically earned. It is grocer Angel King's last day, but it is not a day 
for celebration. Consumed by regret, King suffers a psychotic breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon-Teck Oh's tragic performance as the schizophrenic grocer is a colossal 
achievement. His lyrical speeches accompany emotional roller-coaster extremes 
that require consummate discipline. Oh meets every challenge, becoming a 
poignant, unforgettable figure of forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Canned Goods" delivers the goods. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Canned Goods," Los Angeles Theatre Center Theatre 4, 514 S. Spring St., Los 
Angeles. Fridays-Sundays, 8 p.m. Ends April 24. $5. (213) 485-2437. Running 
time: 1 hour, 40 minutes. 'His Wife': Cute, Coy and Too Long 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "His Wife" at Deaf West Theatre Company is an after-school special in search 
of a network sponsor. An earnest, relentlessly upbeat American Sign Language 
adaptation by Beverly Nero of her musical "The Bimbetto Libretto," this 
ambitious staging never meets the challenge of its material. Any resemblance to 
actual divorce is purely coincidental while a coy, cute and sentimental tale of 
reconciliation unfolds. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite an impressively inventive set design by Jim Barbaley, "His Wife" 
remains tethered to the musical comedy genre. Ed Waterstreet's direction is 
lucid and his actors obviously committed to the material, but it's not enough 
to overcome an indulgent, overlong script. Scenes cry out for musical 
resolution -- or for abrupt blackouts. 
</P>
<P>
 * "His Wife," Deaf West Theatre, 660 N. Heliotrope Drive, Hollywood. 
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 3 p.m. Ends May 1. $15. (213) 660-4673 
(voice); (213) 660-8826 (TTY). Running time: 2 hours, 20 minutes. 'Bright 
Room': Sometimes Brilliant 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Kushner's first professional play, "A Bright Room Called Day," is 
belatedly receiving its Los Angeles premiere at the Odyssey in an appropriately 
academic context. In obtuse, self-conscious scenes about Nazism's rise in 1930s 
Germany, foreshadows abound of Kushner's "Angels in America." 
</P>
<P>
 Under professor Lew Palter's direction, the CalArts School of Theatre students 
adequately serve a sometimes brilliant, sometimes pretentious script by an 
obviously gifted beginner. Since admission is free, I recommend the experience 
to anyone interested in the development of one of America's most significant 
playwrights. "A Bright Room Called Day" teaches by example. 
</P>
<P>
 * "A Bright Room Called Day," Odyssey Theater, 2055 S. Sepulveda Blvd., West 
Los Angeles. Friday-Saturday, 8 p.m. Ends Saturday. Free. (805) 288-2132. 
Running time: 2 hours, 30 minutes. Tunes Don't Work in 'Generation Why' 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Stanley should forget fantasies of a singing career and focus on writing 
and acting. While Stanley performs a variety of characters in her imaginative 
"Generation Why" at Tamarind Theatre, hilarious insights about the so-called 
baby buster generation are abundant and dramatic. But when she breaks out into 
original songs, her solo show dissolves into embarrassing commercial breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, Stanley's talent is considerable. Her use of video is intrinsic to 
her portrait of a young advertising executive struggling to conceive automobile 
commercials appealing to her peers. Her Brechtian asides may provide possible 
insights into the suicide of Nirvana's Kurt Cobain. "Generation Why" smells 
like teen spirit but never sounds like it but . . . Oh well, whatever, never 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Generation Why," Tamarind Theatre, 5919 Franklin Ave., Hollywood. 
Mondays-Wednesdays, 8 p.m. Ends April 27. $10. (213) 883-1610. Running time: 1 
hour, 30 minutes.

MUSIC REVIEWS; CLEVELAND STRINGS AT SCHOENBERG HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cleveland String Quartet brought a tense energy to music of Beethoven, 
Brahms and Libby Larsen on Wednesday in Schoenberg Hall at UCLA. It was an 
energy not always appropriate to the styles of these differing composers. 
</P>
<P>
 Most persuasive was the playing in Larsen's "Quartet: Schoenberg, Schenker and 
Schillinger," composed in 1990 for the Quartet members -- William Preucil and 
Peter Salaff, violins; James Dunham, viola, and Paul Katz, cello. 
</P>
<P>
 The work affectionately traverses the compositional styles of these three 
composers and theoreticians. One suspects there are hidden puns, references and 
quotations that experts would detect in the piece as it advances from austere 
12-tone methodology to final obsessive, off-kilter rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly the stuck-in-a-rut consonances and never-arriving final cadence in 
the middle movement seem to tweak a bit the deep-structure theories of Heinrich 
Schenker. 
</P>
<P>
 There may be some question, however, whether anyone needs another testimonial 
to the shift in 20th-Century music from melody to rhythm, as Larsen explains 
her purpose in a program note, in an age sufficiently dominated by boom boxes 
and rap music. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the four played the work with masterly attention and commitment (even 
when Katz was required to slap the cello as if he were playing bass in a jazz 
band). 
</P>
<P>
 Beethoven's Quartet in G, Opus 18, No. 2, emerged with rugged poise, sunniness 
and insouciance, although also with some raggedness in ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 Brahms' Quartet in B-flat, unfortunately, suffered the most from a 
no-nonsense, impersonal and ultimately antiseptic interpretation offered by the 
four. Dunham tried to inject more expressivity when he had opportunities to do 
so, but Preucil would have none of it. Tension and drive replaced sentiment; 
mere clean execution replaced sweetness and charm. CHRIS PASLES

MUSIC REVIEWS; REVITALIZED BEAUX ARTS TRIO AT AMBASSADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Too often during the latter half of its nearly 40 years of existence, the 
Beaux Arts Trio could coast on the undiminished enthusiasm and talents of its 
pianist, Menahem Pressler, while his jaded colleagues were giving the 
impression of being engaged elsewhere, phoning in their parts, as the saying 
goes. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrival six years ago of cellist Peter Wiley signaled the start of a 
revival. And now that there is a new violinist as well, the redoubtable Ida 
Kavafian, Pressler returns to his rightful position, as part of a vital, 
perfectly matched ensemble rather than star by default. 
</P>
<P>
 With its present membership, the Beaux Arts again represents the gold standard 
for piano trios, as they demonstrated before what looked like a full house at 
Ambassador Auditorium on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Without stooping to didacticism, the artists presented a master class in the 
art of musical communication: with each other and with their appreciative 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening with Beethoven's Trio in G, Opus 1, No. 2, is a daring move. It's a 
long piece, moreover one that begins with an extended stretch of what in less 
comprehending hands might seem an almost impossibly convoluted exercise in 
harmonic noodling. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beaux Arts members patiently unraveled every oddly colored, fascinating 
thread, building to a coherent whole, with a quite astonishing range of soft 
dynamics, before allowing the fast main theme to kick in with tremendous vigor. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentimental charms of Anton Arensky's Tchaikovsky-inspired Trio in D minor 
were treated no less seriously as regards textural clarification, but with a 
richer ensemble sonority and with a feeling of cutting loose any emotional 
restraints, particularly in the scherzo's rollicking trio. 
</P>
<P>
 Felix Mendelssohn's familiar Opus 49 Trio, in D minor (a more Classical and 
refined D minor than Arensky's), sang, roared and sighed -- with grace, energy, 
flawless balances and not a trace of affectation. HERBERT GLASS

JAZZ NOTES: BIGGER NAMES ON NEW YORK CLUB SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dressed in black, her red hair pulled back, composer-arranger Maria Schneider 
sways slightly as she conducts her 17-piece big band on a recent Monday night 
at Visiones, one of the major Greenwich Village jazz rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The music composed and arranged by Schneider, instead of swinging, seems to 
amble, though sometimes the rhythmic pulse can be quite strong, and the group 
of tunes she's written, when played, often hang above the bandstand, creating 
their own architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 The 33-year Schneider's ensemble -- her lineup included trumpeters Tim Hagans 
and Greg Gisbert and saxophonists Rick Margitza and Tim Ries -- was typical of 
the name jazz activity that took place in Manhattan during early April. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the main difference between the L.A. and New York jazz scenes: There is 
simply more recognizable talent appearing in clubs in Manhattan than in Los 
Angeles, and that's because the jazz club tradition is older, more established 
and more artists live in the city. For example, during that first week of 
April, you could catch such notables as pianists Tommy Flanagan, John Hicks, 
George Cables and Joanne Brackeen; saxophonists Joe Lovano, Joe Ford and David 
Sanchez and trumpeter Art Farmer at such clubs as the Village Vanguard, Sweet 
Basil, Bradley's, the Down Beat and the Knickerbocker. 
</P>
<P>
 Business at these various rooms was somewhat stronger than in Southern 
California, but not much stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider, for example, drew packed houses for both Monday shows at the 
74-seat Visiones, where she's appeared weekly for a year, but no music charge 
was in effect -- she would have probably filled any similar-sized L.A. room. 
</P>
<P>
 That same night, drummer Pete (LaRoca) Sims' terrific Swingtime sextet with 
Sanchez, Jimmy Owens (trumpet) and Cables (piano) did scant business at the 
84-seat Down Beat, where the cover was only $5, while Hicks, Lovano and bassist 
Walter Booker filled the 100-seat Bradley's, the vaunted room adjacent to NYU 
where the music charge is $12. On Tuesday, Flangan's classy trio, with Peter 
Washington, bass, and Lewis Nash, drums, drew well at the 140-seat Tavern on 
the Green, where the cover was $17.50, and Bradley's was again full. 
</P>
<P>
 Compare these crowds to examples of last weekend's turnouts in L.A.: Vibist 
Milt Jackson played to good houses at the 125-seat Catalina Bar & Grill on 
Friday and Saturday ($15 cover); bassist Armando Compean did solid business at 
the 55-seat Le Cafe ($8 music charge) and the Elders (Herman Riley, John Heard, 
Phil Wright and Tootie Heath) packed the Club Brasserie (no cover). 
</P>
<P>
 If jazz draws better in Manhattan than in Los Angeles, the reasons seem to be, 
again, the plethora of quality talent, the strong club tradition and the 
proximity of the establishments to one another: Bradley's is a 20-minute cab 
ride from the Upper West Side, for example, and a 10-minute walk from Visiones, 
the Blue Note, Sweet Basil and the Village Vanguard. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider -- who possesses a master's degree from the Eastman School of Music 
-- says that she doesn't make money working Visiones, but it's how she gets her 
music played. The writer has been influenced by Gil Evans, whom she worked 
with, and Bob Brookmeyer, whom she studied with. She says she wants her pieces 
to grow organically. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than write a tune and set it up for solos, backgrounds, and so on, I 
like to take an idea, a germ and make it a building block for the entire 
piece," says Schneider, who can be heard on her fine new Enja release, 
"Evanescence." 
</P>
<P>
 "An idea can be expanded into movements, tensions and resolutions. I like use 
these ideas to grab someone, draw them in. I'm almost trying to create a being 
with each piece. Music is art in time, and to be fully observed, a piece of 
music has to keep a listener's attention from the beginning to the end." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hicks trio at Bradley's was in stark contrast to Schneider's ensemble. 
Here, Hicks, a pianist who wallops his instrument to issue dark, robust tones, 
chose the jazz classics for himself, Lovano and bassist Walter Booker to 
investigate. The audience might have been treated to Tadd Dameron's "Hot 
House," Thelonious Monk's "Rhythm-A-Ning" or Mal Waldron's "Soul Eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 On each, Lovano's breathy sound and smooth-then-angular ideas were a 
springboard to Hicks' dynamic improvisations, which were replete with groups of 
notes played so furiously fast they blurred in the air, and hard-hit clusters 
that seemed to stop time. 
</P>
<P>
 Critic's Choices: Trumpet great Conte Candoli and pianist Frank Strazzeri, a 
Bud Powell devotee, are members of guitarist Sid Jacobs' quartet, holding forth 
Tuesday at the Club Brasserie; Jacobs is also there Wednesday. Candoli can also 
be heard with altoist Bud Shank's sextet tonight and Saturday at the Jazz 
Bakery.

JAZZ REVIEW; GUITARIST MIKE STERN'S SHOW TAKES NO PRISONERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Guitarist Mike Stern didn't waste any time getting down to business in his 
opening night set at Catalina Bar & Grill on Tuesday. Before the audio 
equipment was barely warmed up, he had ignited a blistering, riff-based, 
contemporary examination of the Jerome Kern standard "Yesterdays."And that was 
just the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stern trio's bassist, Jeff Andrews, picked up the torch on the second 
number, "Seven-Thirty," and blazed through a breathlessly hyperactive solo that 
provided a perfect counter to Stern's take-no-captives improvising. Both 
players (as well as drummer Ben Perowsky) are astounding technicians. But what 
made their music so fascinating was their ability to place their technique at 
the service of probing, improvisational explorations. 
</P>
<P>
 In solo after solo, Stern -- who has been a regular with Miles Davis, as well 
as Blood, Sweat & Tears -- revealed a capacity to blend rapid-fire playing with 
hard, rhythmic swing and occasional dashes of wit and humor. As much as any 
guitarist since the early days of John McLaughlin, Stern brings life to both 
forms of music by merging the dramatic intensity of rock with the 
envelope-stretching demands of contemporary jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a continuously impressive performance by one of the most exhilarating 
artists of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mike Stern at Catalina Bar & Grill, 1640 N. Cahuenga Blvd., Hollywood. (213) 
466-2210. $12 cover; $15 tonight and Saturday, with two-drink minimum. Stern 
plays two sets each night, 9 and 11, through Sunday.

HOME TECH / CD CORNER: 'EDITH PIAF': LOVELY IN ANY LANGUAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Edith Piaf had just one Top 40 U.S. pop hit -- an English version of the 
classic "La Vie En Rose" in 1950 -- but she is one of the most celebrated 
vocalists of the modern pop era. Cited as an influence by artists as varied as 
David Bowie and Linda Ronstadt, Piaf combined a cabaret brightness, a blues 
soulfulness and a pop accessibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Her distinctive and affecting style is showcased in "Edith Piaf: 30th 
Anniversaire," a two-disc set from Capitol Records marking the 30th anniversary 
of her death. 
</P>
<P>
 Though most of the album is sung in Piaf's native French, the celebration and 
the occasional melancholic touches in her music easily transcend language 
barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, a few of the songs on the album should be well-known to older pop 
fans in the United States through hit English versions by other artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them: "Les Trois Cloches" (a U.S. hit in 1952 when retitled "Three 
Bells" and sung by Les Compagnons De La Chanson, who accompanied Piaf on the 
French version of the song) and "La Goualante Du Pauvre Jean" (a 1956 hit when 
retitled "The Poor People of Paris" and performed by the Les Baxter Orchestra). 
</P>
<P>
 Piaf's own story is almost as remarkable as her musical legacy -- though it is 
hard to find two accounts that agree in every detail. 
</P>
<P>
 As generally agreed, Piaf -- whose real name was Edith Giovanna Gassion -- was 
born in a working-class district of Paris in 1915. Her mother was believed to 
have been an Italian cafe singer and her father has been described variously as 
a circus acrobat and a traveling showman. 
</P>
<P>
 Abandoned by her mother, the infant was placed by her father in the care of a 
madam of a cheap Normandy brothel, according to the liner notes in the Capitol 
set. 
</P>
<P>
 She rejoined her father around the age of 7 and accompanied him on his circus 
travels, during which period he reportedly encouraged her to begin singing. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Lepee, the owner of a cabaret, later hired her as a performer. He was 
apparently the one who suggested the singer change her surname to the French 
word for sparrow. She landed a recording contract and soon became one of the 
most popular entertainers in all of Europe. She died in 1963.

HOME TECH / VIDEOS: 'PELICAN' GRIEF FOR RENTERS AND RETAILERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Renters will be happy to hear that Warner's "The Pelican Brief," co-starring 
Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington, is coming to home video on June 29. But 
there's some bad news too -- for both renters and small retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 The wholesale price on that title will be up a few dollars -- to the retail 
equivalent of about $103. Other video companies may follow Warner's lead, 
raising their prices too. What's ominous for renters is that this wholesale 
price hike may trigger a rise in rental prices this summer. Some retailers may 
have no choice but to pass the increase on to renters. 
</P>
<P>
 Warners hasn't been commenting on the impending increase, but distributors and 
retailers have been buzzing about it. Of course, it's the small retailers, many 
already operating on tight profit margins, who are most nervous about the 
prospect of being forced to raise rental prices. They stand to take the biggest 
hit. The chains that do big-volume business can more easily absorb a wholesale 
price increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Tech News 
</P>
<P>
 If you can't program your VCR, you're technologically challenged -- or just a 
dolt with machines. Those in this category will be happy to hear that VCR 
programming continues to get simpler. Once they're set up, some of these 
programming gadgets are easy to use. The problem is, though, that you have to 
be a rocket scientist to set them up. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony has a solution for part of the VCR programming hassle -- on two new VCRs 
due in June, you never have to set the clock. The VCRs pick up a continuous 
time signal from local PBS stations, which always have the correct time. As 
long as the machine is plugged in, it will automatically read the correct time. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially this feature will be available only on two high-end VCRs, selling 
for $600 and $650. Buyers will have to wait -- probably a year or two -- until 
this helpful feature trickles down to the cheaper VCRs. 
</P>
<P>
 Special Interest Videos 
</P>
<P>
 Orion's "Super Dooper Baseball Bloopers 2" ($15), part of the flood of 
baseball videos tied to the new season, showcases the lighter side of the 
sport. . . . KidVision's "There Goes a Fire Truck" ($11, 35 minutes) puts kids 
behind the wheel. A real rush for ages 3-8 -- and a kick for adults too. . . . 
Gluttons for punishment who want to relive the terror of the Jan. 17 earthquake 
will get a jolt from "Quake!" -- 40 minutes' worth of chilling CNN footage. On 
Turner at $15. . . . Despite a long-winded title, "1071 Fifth Avenue, Frank 
Lloyd Wright and the Story of the Guggenheim Museum" is an intriguing 
documentary about the architect's remarkable creation (Home Vision, $30). 
What's New on Video 
</P>
<P>
 "Carlito's Way" (MCA/Universal). This re-teaming of the star (Al Pacino) and 
director (Brian De Palma) of the camp classic "Scarface" is just OK 
entertainment if you like gangster movies. It's the simple story of a New York 
drug dealer trying to go straight. Its pluses are Sean Penn's performance as a 
slimy lawyer and two thrilling sequences -- a social-club shootout and the 
climactic chase. 
</P>
<P>
 "Malice" (New Line). Director Harold Becker has made a riveting, glossy 
B-movie. With a rapist on the loose in a small-town college community, a 
professor (Bill Pullman) and his wife (Nicole Kidman) take in a boarder (Alec 
Baldwin), who's a womanizing surgeon. Hardly anybody is what he or she seems to 
be. If you roll with the twists -- and some of them are real stretches -- 
you'll have a good time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cool Runnings" (Disney). The adventures of the Jamaican bobsled team in the 
1988 Olympics have been fictionalized and turned into an uplifting, 
kiddie-oriented Disney comedy. The late John Candy plays the has-been coach who 
has to teach a team of athletes from a hot-weather country a cold-weather 
sport. The umpteenth reworking of a formula plot -- "Bad News Bears," "The 
Mighty Ducks," etc. 
</P>
<P>
 "Visions of Light: The Art of Cinematography" (FoxVideo). These interviews 
with cinematographers, illuminating beautifully filmed sequences from such 
films as "The Grapes of Wrath" and "The Last Emperor," are a must-see feast for 
film buffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Upcoming 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Jones," "Flesh and Bone," "Ruby in Paradise," "The Saint of Fort 
Washington" and "Another Stakeout" (Wednesday); "Mrs. Doubtfire" and "Batman: 
Mask of the Phantasm" (April 26); "Ernest Rides Again" (April 27); "The Remains 
of the Day" and "A Perfect World" (May 4); "Addams Family Values," "The Three 
Musketeers," "Orlando" and "Into the West" (May 11); "A Dangerous Woman" and 
"Look Who's Talking Now" (May 18); "The Piano" and "Rudy" (May 25); "Short 
Cuts" (June 1); "Wayne's World 2" (June 8); "Six Degrees of Separation" (June 
22).

NATIONAL VIDEO RENTALS ; NO ONE'S CATCHING 'THE FUGITIVE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The competition is still having no luck chasing "The Fugitive," which 
continues to be the runaway rental champ. Many retailers are reporting that 
it's truly clobbering all challengers, renting about twice as fast as any 
others. Of course, rental outlets can afford to stock up on "The Fugitive," 
since its retail price is just $25. They can buy several copies of it for the 
price of just one rental copy of the average movie. "The Joy Luck Club," which 
did good box-office business ($32.4-million gross), opened strong on the chart, 
at No. 9. This drama about Asian American mothers and daughters is a solid Top 
5 candidate. It looks as if the Bruce Willis cop-action movie "Striking 
Distance" won't get closer than striking distance to the top of the chart. 
Despite being a strong Top 5 rental, it never reached No. 1 and now seems to be 
past its peak. And renters so far haven't been tickled by the comedy "Fatal 
Instinct," which debuted last week at No. 34 and stayed there. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some video retailers are predicting the suicide last week of Nirvana's Kurt 
Cobain will boost interest in the acclaimed new rental, "Dazed and Confused." 
Though it's about dazed and confused teens of the '70s, much of it is relevant 
to the current generation. Some of the characters in the movie, which features 
a cast of unknowns, grapple with the same kind of alienation issues that 
trouble today's teens--and also haunted Cobain. "Dazed" didn't really find an 
audience in theaters ($5.2-million gross) but could click as a rental. It 
debuted at No. 14. 03,25,06,08 Rank Weeks Last on the Week Chart 1."The

HOME TECH / LASER BIN: CORMAN'S 'USHER,' 'PIT' HOLD UP WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SALTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When director Roger Corman tried to sell B-movie mogul Sam Arkoff on the idea 
of bringing Edgar Allen Poe's "The Fall of the House of Usher" to the screen, a 
bewildered Arkoff, whose American International Pictures had made a fortune 
producing monster movies, asked him, "Where's the monster?" Corman was ready 
with the answer: "The house is the monster." 
</P>
<P>
 Satisfied, Arkoff approved the project and Corman, with his band of technical 
wizards, shot the film in 15 days on a budget of about $270,000, much of the 
money being spent on the wisest investment Corman ever made: hiring actor 
Vincent Price. It was the first of eight memorable Corman ventures into 
Poe-land and the film became one of the biggest hits of 1960, winning rare 
critical acclaim for B-director Corman. 
</P>
<P>
 Now "The Fall of the House of Usher" and the second film in the series, "Pit 
and the Pendulum," have been issued together in a digitally mastered widescreen 
edition presented in their original 2:35.1 CinemaScope and Panavision aspect 
ratios (Orion Home Video/Image Entertainment, $50, letterboxed), with excellent 
detailed liner notes. The good news is that they hold up surprisingly well. 
</P>
<P>
 Few ever did a better job of bringing the diabolical Poe stories to the 
screen. One reason was that Corman surrounded himself with first-rate talent. 
The key was the literate adaptation of the Poe novel by Richard Matheson, the 
veteran science-fiction writer who wrote "The Incredible Shrinking Man" and 
many fine "Twilight Zone" scripts. Matheson created words and Corman created 
cinematic images that never violated the original. Another key member of 
Corman's creative team was Daniel Haller, who had a legendary ability to find 
second-hand sets, scenery and props and turn them into expensive-looking 
backgrounds. Veteran cinematographer Floyd Crosby gave the films a lavish 
veneer with matte shots of the castle and exteriors. Musician-composer Les 
Baxter fashioned an appropriate score and Price and an articulate cast of 
actors did the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Corman also saved money and came up with a realistic beginning and ending by 
sending a second unit to then-burned Griffith Park to show a bleak, blackened 
landscape. Price is his menacing best as the doomed, sensory-sensitive Roderick 
Usher, who ultimately brings the house of Usher down, but even Price and Corman 
can't do much with the hokey, unrealistic fire at the climax of the film. That 
fire is the only indication that the film was done on a shoestring. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1961 "Pit and the Pendulum" reunited the principal "Ushers" -- Corman, 
Price, Matheson and Baxter, who created an atonal score for the frightening 
film. "Pit" has a more exaggerated look and feel than the first Poe film, from 
the broad gestures and dialogue to the set itself, which feels remarkably 
similar to the previous "House." But it's a frightening tour-de-force. 
</P>
<P>
 John Kerr ends up in the demented Nicholas Medina (Price) Inquisition-era 
torture chamber. Barbara Steele as Price's treacherous wife, who meets her own 
ignominious end, almost steals the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Art director Haller is credited with deciding that the rubberized blade of the 
pendulum had to be scrapped for one with a sharp metal blade for close-ups, 
something that may well have helped Kerr ("Tea and Sympathy") eventually choose 
law over acting. Vintage photos from both films accompany the handsome two-disc 
set. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you think docudrama started with television, take a look at another fine 
double bill, this one on MGM/UA Home Video starring Paul Muni: "The Story of 
Louis Pasteur" and "The Life of Emile Zola" ($60). These '30s biopics almost 
feel interchangeable in tone and approach, with Muni distinguishable as the 
French author Zola basically by a pair of pince-nez. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1936 "Pasteur" brought Oscars to Muni and to screenwriters Sheridan Gibney 
and Pierre Collings, under the direction of William Dieterle. At the time the 
film was made, when microbes seemed to be coming under control, Pasteur's 
achievements in developing vaccines for anthrax and rabies might not have 
seemed so significant. But in an era when AIDS research still seems in its 
infancy and bacteria and viruses seem to now be able to outwit science's most 
powerful arsenal, there may be lessons to be learned here. And they're told 
with great feeling and fine craftsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the 1937 "Life of Emile Zola" seems, unfortunately, to be as 
current as today's headlines. Injustice never seems to go out of style. 
</P>
<P>
 Dieterle again directed, with Oscars going to supporting actor Joseph 
Schildkraut as the wrongly accused Capt. Dreyfus (whom the novelist exonerated 
with his heralded "J'accuse" defense, which today would have made all previous 
court TV sensations seem like warm-ups). The film also features Gale 
Sondergaard, Donald Crisp and Louis Calhern in fine supporting roles. Writers 
Norman Reilly Raine, Heinz Herald and Gez Herczeg won Academy Awards and the 
film a best picture Oscar. Max Steiner's music covers up any historical 
inaccuracies. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-disc set includes the original theatrical trailers for both films, 
which are as sincere an effort in trying to be true to the original stories as 
Hollywood was capable of in the 1930s.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; GRIFTERS PUT THEIR STAMP ON DISTORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Grifters don't seem care so much about moving the masses as just getting 
through the day. And for this band of Memphis slackers -- looking a little more 
worn and menacing than most of their indie-band peers, like your older 
brother's slightly disreputable friends -- a day apparently can be a difficult 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
 From all indications, the group's set at the Alligator Lounge on Wednesday was 
designed as it went along, but inadvertently or not, it emerged as a musical 
representation of the passage from bleary awakening to charged activity to the 
onset of nightmares. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grifters' dense volumes of squalling distortion owe a debt to everyone 
from Sonic Youth to Pavement to the Meat Puppets to R.E.M., but the band really 
doesn't sound quite like anyone else. The spasms and shudders, the sudden halts 
and redistributions of sonic weight, seemed random at first, but they were too 
precisely placed to be written off as deconstructive anarchy. These guys have 
chops to spare, but after five years they're still operating at the purest 
levels of underground enterprise, which means you'll have to come to them.

ART GALLERIES; 'THE L.A. GUN SHOW' ABANDONS ITS ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KANDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The L.A. Gun Show," a group exhibition at Julie Rico Gallery of Los 
Angeles-based artists who explore issues relating to firearms, is a curious and 
ultimately depressing phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't the carnivalesque atmosphere -- the catchy rhythms of Keith Pirlot 
and Kevin Hurley's installation, in which the successive sounds of a shotgun 
blast and moment of impact circulate incessantly on an audio loop; or Joe 
Wolek's pastel-colored, handgun-shaped "soaps on a rope," hanging from the 
rafters like party streamers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is it the casual apoliticism of Tom Henry III's grid of monochrome 
paintings, wherein the N.R.A. logo is reduced to an incidental motif; or Henry 
Vincent's "Gun Fax," which seems somehow oblivious to its own imagery. 
</P>
<P>
 What's depressing are the show's broader philosophical implications. On the 
one hand, it is perfectly logical that artists should be attracted to guns. 
Guns are dangerous, and the avant-garde has long prided itself on subversive, 
transgressive attitudes and forms. According to the avant-garde's recalcitrant 
mythology, the art object is as threatening as any automatic weapon, if only to 
the bourgeois consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Art is, indeed, perilous, shattering, revolutionary or menacing purely on the 
level of the symbolic. Yet herein lies the rub. That the artists in "The L.A. 
Gun Show" feel compelled to turn to a subject that is quite literally explosive 
in order to experience their historic role (and to communicate it to an 
audience) speaks poorly for their faith in art. At least, it speaks poorly for 
that of curator Patricia Watts, who may have fashioned a trend where no trend 
exists. 
</P>
<P>
 Art is a process of symbolization. To abandon that, as this show seems to do, 
is to abandon art altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 * Julie Rico Gallery, 2623 Main St., Santa Monica, (310) 399-1177, through May 
8. Closed Sun. and Mon.  
</P>
<P>
 In Accord With Science: In 1914, the Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to Max 
Von Laue, who created the field of X-ray structural analysis. Albert Einstein 
called Von Laue's discovery of the means to investigate radiation by wavelength 
determination, as well as to study the structure of the irradiated material, 
"one of the most beautiful in physics." 
</P>
<P>
 In "Max Von Laue's Solid State Matter," Gloria Graham examines the notion of 
the beautiful, trapped since the 18th Century within the confining realm of 
aesthetics. In classical thought, beauty was never understood as an aesthetic 
effect, a residue of the art experience. Beauty connoted perfection, symmetry, 
definite limitations; these, according to Aristotle, "are the chief properties 
that the mathematical sciences draw attention to." 
</P>
<P>
 Graham does not wish to exchange one confining realm for another, to award to 
science that which aesthetics has for so long held hostage. Instead, the 
purpose of her project at Angles Gallery is to bring about a kind of accord. If 
the great problem of aesthetics is the nature of the relation between 
representation and object, appearance and reality, so, is it the long-standing 
dream of science. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering its rather spectacular ambitions, her series of graphite line 
drawings of the molecular structures of various crystals and minerals -- 
titanium, silicon, corundum, beryl, etc. -- is surprisingly understated. The 
forms are spindly and elegant, masquerading as geometric abstractions. As soon 
as one glimpses the text that runs down the side of the image, which elucidates 
each substance's chemical structure, they suddenly come into view as something 
far less generic. 
</P>
<P>
 The literalness of these images muddles their profound metaphorical quality, 
in fact, suggesting that all such antinomies are suspect. In Graham's work even 
the minimal appears minimal for only a moment. Then it swerves into the 
territory of dazzling complexity, as if it always belonged there.

 Slapstick: Adjective-friendly descriptions of art are often obfuscatory; 
unadorned descriptions, however, can be equally misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Gummer makes large, abstract sculptures of bronze and aluminum. The words 
alone are rather off-putting: dry, heavy, humorless. But Gummer's new work at 
the Fred Hoffman Gallery -- all slapstick angles, punctured planes, exaggerated 
lines and top-heavy proportions -- is far from a dour, Modernist exercise. If 
anything, it jabs affectionately at the Modernist legacy that informs it, while 
sidestepping the baroque tomfoolery favored by many younger abstract sculptors. 
</P>
<P>
 Constructivism is a reference point here, as it long has been for Gummer. So 
is Pop, in terms of the work's happily hyperbolic forms. Yet, Futurism weighs 
in most heavily -- not the art historical kind, but the Hollywood-ized 
interpretation. Think "Blade Runner," not Boccioni. 
</P>
<P>
 Each curve, dip, ripple and strut of metal comprises part of a space-age sign 
scape. The work seems to fashion a post-apocalyptic architecture in miniature: 
undulating hangars for off-world vehicles propped up on criss-crossing stilts; 
staircases leading onto M.C. Escher-esque paradoxes; quake-ready freeways that 
are already buckled and twisted. Gummer eschews the literal for the fantastic, 
which is quite a trick for an artist schooled in non-objectivity.

 Social Satire: A melting-pot scribe, Depression-era sage and sophisticate 
enamored of the rhythms of folklore, William Gropper was one of this country's 
preeminent Social Realist painters. Most active during the 1930s and 1940s, 
Gropper perfected a wide-ranging repertoire of social types: shifty lawyers and 
filibustering senators, dawdling Hasidim and yeasty bakers, millionaires in 
showy coats and the sweat-shop workers who clothed them. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most satirists, Gropper's swipes are painted with a broad brush. 
Industrialists are fat and leering, the poor are thin and tormented. Steeped in 
the Marxist dogma so seductive to artists of the period, Gropper was interested 
in illustrating the class struggle, which allowed for no shades of gray. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet unlike much contemporary political work, which all but eschews formal 
issues to focus on content (as if the two are indeed separable), Gropper 
remained attuned to questions of style. His work at Heritage Gallery shows how 
American artists of the first half of the 20th Century (even those for whom a 
social agenda was paramount) struggled to absorb European Modernist idioms. 
</P>
<P>
 His images boast Pablo Picasso's fractured planes, Marc Chagall's magic 
realism and Max Beckmann's emblematic grotesquerie. If this eclecticism 
occasionally feels like so much undigested aesthetic matter, Gropper's graphic 
sensibility carries the day. 
</P>
<P>
 This sensibility is represented in its purest form in the cartoons Gropper 
produced to accompany Robert Benchley's column in the New York American 
throughout the late 1920s and 1930s. These Jazz Age pictograms are the 
revelation of this fine show; nowhere else does Gropper's wit run so 
sure-footed and light.

FAMILY THEATER REVIEW; 'FINDING HOME' DELIVERS A MESSAGE OF UNDERSTANDING

 "It's like I'm Sega and they're Nintendo." That's how newcomer Burger 
describes his discomfort in South Coast Repertory's entertaining Educational 
Touring Production of the musical "Finding Home," when he can't understand the 
language or the customs in mythical Aboland. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's theme embraces the need to respect differences and find common 
ground for understanding; it isn't subtle (and the cast's musical talents are 
modest), but it is delivered with humor and visual excitement -- Dwight Richard 
Odle's wildly patterned, tropical fantasy costumes, giant puppet heads and 
veggie hats are terrific. 
</P>
<P>
 And, although the musical was written for the company's 1984 school tour and 
for a "Drama of Immigration" project by SCR's dramaturge Jerry Patch and 
Michael Bigelow Dixon, the revival is obviously timely -- despite its retro 
surfer hero Burger (Kevin M. Gregg) and his "gnarly," "hoe-daddies" 
surfer-speak. 
</P>
<P>
 Directed by John-David Keller, with music and lyrics by Diane King Vann and 
choreography by Diane Doyle, the show concludes that rather than a melting pot, 
a better metaphor for unity might be a salad bowl: "We're all different 
vegetables, but we come from the same garden." 
</P>
<P>
 The public can see the show free as part of the Imagination Celebration arts 
festival in Orange County, Saturday at Westminster Mall and April 30 at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center's back lot. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Finding Home," Westminster Mall, Bolsa Avenue and Goldenwest Street, 
Saturday at 10:30 a.m.; (714) 898-2558, and Orange County Performing Arts 
Center back lot, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa, April 30 at 12:10 p.m.;

RESTAURANT REVIEW; CAFE SUSHI: SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are two distinctly different dining experiences to be had at Cafe Sushi: 
the sushi bar and the dining room. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The small, pine-paneled Japanese restaurant is popular and often crowded. As 
the night progresses, the number of backward baseball hats increases, as do 
tattoos and pencil-thin young women. By 9:30 or so, seniority belongs to the 
hip 40-somethings. 
</P>
<P>
 The dining room is a series of booths and small tables divided by glass 
partitions etched with turtles, bat skates and shrimp. Once seated, you are 
handed a one-page laminated menu, a long printed sushi menu onto which the 
waitress will write your order, and another laminated board on which there's a 
pictorial display of house specialties, including such delicacies as the 
Tiger's Eye, a roll of salmon and squid and avocado and gobo root in a tube of 
boiled calamari that somehow manages to approximate the precise taste and 
texture of a rubbery hard-boiled egg. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting at one of the tables is a more insular and typical restaurant 
experience, and, as Japanese cafe experiences go, unremarkable. You order from 
good-natured young waiters and waitresses who do not even pretend to be sushi 
or Japanese food experts. (Once, after a discussion with the waitress about the 
sukiyaki, I order it and she brings me teriyaki instead.) Pork gyoza , Japanese 
dumplings, are just fine. Tempura is heavily battered and greasy. 
</P>
<P>
 The waitress warns me that the sukiyaki, a cast-iron kettle of glass noodles, 
bamboo shoots, enoki mushrooms and chicken chunks, suffers from a sugary broth 
and, when I eventually do get the dish, I find she's absolutely right. 
</P>
<P>
 But a combination of broiled fish includes a very generous portion of tuna, 
whitefish, shrimp and scallops -- the five plump, minimally cooked scallops 
alone are worth the price of dinner. Typically, the dinner comes with a 
Thousand Island-dressed mixed green salad. 
</P>
<P>
 Things are really much more fun and vital at the sushi bar. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not even that the sushi bar is that great; in fact, it's pretty 
workman-like. The first thing I notice is how worn the sushi planks are: 
They've obviously been used thousands of times. While some sushi bars make a 
point of collecting stunning bits and pieces of ceramics and lacquerware, Cafe 
Sushi's tableware collection is modest and a bit battered. 
</P>
<P>
 But this place does volume business: Five or six chefs, some of them notably 
handsome, work the bar at dinner. It's a good place for anyone intimidated by 
sushi protocol, or fearful of mispronouncing Japanese terms. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the mystique of sushi takes a beating here: One sees 
uniform lengths of crab shaken out of plastic bags. Oysters are pre-shucked. 
Monkfish liver comes out of an aluminum tube. Such disillusionments aside, 
there's a reason why this place is popular. The fish for the most part is 
nicely cut and tastes fresh. The chefs are attentive. 
</P>
<P>
 A salmon roll holds a lot of hot, crackly salmon and sweet, adorably crunchy 
gobo root. Spanish mackerel, topped with a pretty snarl of scallions, is juicy 
with a vinegary sauce. Monkfish liver looks like a 50-50 bar, a pretty swirl of 
orange and white held on rice by a seaweed wrapper. At its best, monkfish liver 
tastes like great foie gras ; Cafe Sushi's tastes like a pleasant, very mild 
pate .  
</P>
<P>
 I expected the tempura tuna to be like the tempura shrimp roll, a piece of 
fried seafood in a rice-and-seaweed wrapper, but in this case, the whole roll 
has been battered and fried, then sliced and served in a soy-flavored broth so 
that both the interior tuna and avocado are piping hot -- it's really quite 
good. 
</P>
<P>
 At this sushi bar, it's best to stick with old standbys: tuna, yellowfish, 
salmon and so forth. Bonito isn't available and when we order sea bass, the 
sushi chef says, "No! Halibut!" as if the two were interchangeable. Some of the 
house specialty rolls are a little over the top; the Deacon roll, named for a 
customer, is made with both tuna and yellowtail and winds up being the biggest, 
fattest roll I've ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 The only downside of sitting at the sushi bar is that you are virtually 
ignored by the wait staff -- and they control the much-desired water pitcher. 
</P>

dinner seven days. Beer, wine and sake. Major credit cards. Dinner for two,

ARGUING OVER ART; BEACHES: THE COASTAL COMMISSION IS EXPECTED TO RULE WHETHER 
SANTA MONICA CAN PLACE MORE SCULPTURES ON ITS SHORELINE. CRITICS OF THE PLAN 
SAY THE WORKS DISTRACT FROM THE SCENERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A longstanding feud over public art on Santa Monica's beaches was expected to 
be resolved Thursday by the California Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica Arts Commissioner Bruria Finkel said she would argue in favor of 
placing artwork on beaches, while Louise Gabriel, president of the historical 
society, said she would ask the panel to prohibit it. 
</P>
<P>
 Some pieces, such as "Singing Beach Chairs," are already in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Finkel and Gabriel have lengthy petitions to bolster their contention 
that people want -- or don't want -- the artwork. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them will go home unhappy. The way things are going, that is likely to 
be Gabriel, who has fought for years against Finkel's brainchild, Natural 
Elements Sculpture Park, a series of eight related pieces that are part of an 
overall coastal art plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Finkel says the sculpture garden complements nature and encourages public 
interaction with art. A trip to the beach "is not just sand in your sandwich," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabriel and her supporters are equally vehement in maintaining that the 
beaches' natural beauty is best left unadorned. Works of art "distract from the 
magnificent scenic view of Santa Monica Bay," Gabriel said. 
</P>
<P>
 She has already lost a round with the Santa Monica City Council, which last 
year voted 6 to 1 to approve a comprehensive plan that called for 16 pieces of 
art along the coast, 13 of them at the shoreline. The council acted at the 
request of the Coastal Commission, which balked at approving the beach artwork 
on a piecemeal basis in 1989, saying it was impossible to ascertain the 
cumulative impact. 
</P>
<P>
 By that time, the council and the commission had already given the go-ahead to 
several pieces, including "Singing Beach Chairs" and "Art Tool." 
</P>
<P>
 The chairs, on the sand close to the roadway north of Pico Boulevard, resemble 
lifeguard chairs and make sounds like a pipe organ when wind blows through 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby is "Art Tool," a 12-ton concrete roller with an intricate relief 
pattern of a cityscape. When pulled by a tractor, it imprints the cityscape on 
the sand. Most of the time, the roller sits inside a chain-link fence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coastal Commission staff is recommending approval of the city's art plan, 
which includes three more controversial works. But the staff suggests requiring 
separate approval by the commission for any further projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The three pending projects are a 14-foot statue of Mohandas K. Gandhi for 
Pacific Palisades Park; "Solar Web," a 52-foot-wide metal jungle-gym-like 
sculpture for the south beach area, and "Twilight and Yearning," featuring 
fishing boats strapped to pilings beneath the Santa Monica Pier. Finkel said 
this last work signifies the polluted state of the ocean; the boats will be 
unshackled when the pollution is cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coastal Commission staff report said the three proposed works would not 
impede public access to the beach.

EPA MAY MOVE MORE RESIDENTS IN DDT CLEANUP; ENVIRONMENT: FEARS ESCALATE AS 
HIGHER LEVELS ARE FOUND. THE AGENCY DELAYS DIGGING AND SAYS OTHER FAMILIES MAY 
BE SENT TO HOTELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Confronted with growing neighborhood unrest, the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency has temporarily postponed its excavation of DDT-tainted soil from two 
back yards near Torrance, and officials say it is possible that the agency will 
agree to move more families during the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Central to the dispute is a community group's request that the EPA relocate up 
to 17 families while the soil is removed. Three families already were moved 
temporarily from their homes to hotels Monday at federal expense. Two families 
have refused to sign agreements allowing the EPA to do the work. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the excavation has been planned for weeks, neighborhood fears 
increased sharply with the news last week that DDT levels in the two yards 
along West 204th Street east of Torrance city limits were more than seven times 
higher than previous tests showed -- and as much as 45 times higher than levels 
considered safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about a whole new ballgame here. More testing needs to be done 
before they start digging that up," said community leader Cynthia Babich, who 
as of Wednesday night still had not signed the agreement because of questions 
about the project's safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Babich's back yard is one of two scheduled to be excavated because high levels 
of the banned pesticide were found in them this winter. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA had hoped to break ground for the two-week project by Thursday but now 
says the work will be postponed at least until next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Babich said she and other residents negotiated a truce with the EPA on 
Wednesday that calls for the project to be halted while the federal agency 
addresses community concerns about safety. Two key issues, she said, are 
whether the EPA will agree to relocate more families and to build what she 
called a "wind-screen" around the project to contain the DDT-contaminated soil 
during the work. 
</P>
<P>
 Guillermo Aguirre, Babich's next-door neighbor, who also has refused to sign 
an agreement with the EPA, on Wednesday praised the agency for postponing the 
project and for what he called a more cooperative stance. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Donohue, an EPA spokeswoman, said it is "perfectly possible" that 
more families may be relocated to hotels temporarily but that no final 
decisions have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA also has agreed to the concept of building a wind-screen but must 
first study the screen's design and technical aspects, Donohue said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is being postponed, not only because two families have not signed 
agreements, but because of neighbors' questions, Donohue added. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a widely used pesticide, DDT was banned for most uses in the United 
States in 1972. It damages the reproduction of wildlife and is suspected of 
causing cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials recommend taking precautions when DDT concentrations exceed 
100 parts per million, and they consider 260 p.p.m. grounds for immediate 
cleanup. Based on earlier testing in the mid-1980s, the EPA had concluded that 
DDT levels in the area did not threaten public health. But the agency decided 
to remove the soil after tests this winter detected unusually high DDT levels 
-- 245 p.p.m. in Babich's back yard and 606 p.p.m. in Aguirre's yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests made public last Friday revealed even higher levels of the pesticide, 
reaching 4,509 p.p.m. in an area near Babich's back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials have said the excavation does not pose a health hazard and that 
the three families have been relocated so that they are not inconvenienced by 
the excavation work. 
</P>
<P>
 Although agency experts say the DDT found on West 204th Street may simply be 
an isolated deposit, or "hot spot," some residents suspect the substance may 
have traveled from the nearby site of the former Montrose Chemical Corp., where 
the pesticide was manufactured from 1947 to 1982. Montrose is now a federal 
Superfund site.

GROWING MYSTERY UNDERGROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The finger-pointing has already begun in the wake of the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority's admission Wednesday that parts of the new Red Line 
subway tunnels are misaligned and will need to be re-excavated. But regardless 
of who ultimately pays the price for this latest blunder, the seemingly endless 
series of problems that has plagued this project isn't going to do much to 
inspire public enthusiasm for the new mass transit system. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year a Times investigation found other safety-related problems on the Red 
Line, which currently runs from Union Station to MacArthur Park. It turns out 
that tunnel walls in parts of the recently opened stretch of Red Line were 
thinly constructed and as a result, some seismic experts say, might be 
vulnerable to earthquakes. Contractor Tutor-Saliba Corp., which blamed the 
problem partly on misalignment, agreed to make and pay for necessary repairs -- 
an appropriate move. 
</P>
<P>
 With the second phase of construction at hand, more bad news comes: Not only 
is the $165-million tunnel project nine months behind schedule, about a third 
of the 4.5-mile extension from MacArthur Park to Hollywood is out of alignment. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Shea-Kiewit-Kenny, the contractor, says that "anyone 
questioning the alignment problems . . . does not understand tunnel 
construction or has other motivations." That's possible, and surely the 
contractor will have its full day in the court of public opinion. But with 
millions of taxpayer dollars at stake, Los Angeles transportation officials 
have every right to question construction methods and project management. As 
one incredulous MTA board member wondered: "Is this yet another question of 
failure of construction management? . . . I thought we had been led to believe 
that problems had been resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 So had everyone else. But it would appear that nettlesome problems in quality 
control and construction methods continue to plague what is already the most 
expensive subway project in the nation. Franklin White, the chief executive 
officer of the MTA, who took the job only a year ago, now has another tough one 
in his in-box.

IT'S AN ADDICTIVE MENACE -- FACE IT; REAL ISSUE IN TOBACCO HEARINGS: NATION'S 
HEALTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The time for straight answers is here," said Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los 
Angeles) on the eve of hearings by his health subcommittee into what the 
tobacco industry is up to. Ah, yes. But calling for straight answers and 
getting them can be two very different things. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cigarette smoking is not addictive," testified William Campbell, president of 
Philip Morris USA, at Thursday's hearing. "We do not do anything to hook 
smokers or keep them hooked," averred James Johnston, chairman and chief 
executive of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Confronted with such straight-faced assurances, the eyebrows uncontrollably 
lift, the jaw drops, the gorge rises, the mind boggles. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of thousands of Americans die every year -- many of them in 
indescribable agony -- from diseases caused by smoking. Can anyone truly 
believe that in the years and decades before their deaths they stuck to their 
suicidal habit out of rational choice, the way one might choose between soup or 
salad to start a meal, rather than because they had become helplessly addicted 
to tobacco and the powerful drug it contains? 
</P>
<P>
 The solemn assurances once again given by tobacco industry officials, the 
suggestion that smoking is no more addictive than watching television or 
playing video games, are preposterous. The U.S. surgeon general, the American 
Medical Assn. and the World Health Organization, relying on countless studies 
by independent researchers, all have determined that tobacco is as addictive as 
heroin or cocaine. Indeed, some studies have suggested, kicking tobacco 
addiction is even harder than kicking heroin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Smokers are not drug users or addicts, and we do not appreciate being 
characterized as such," huffed and puffed one of the industry executives at 
Thursday's hearing. Strip any moral or character implications from that 
statement and assess it simply on the basis of pharmacologic fact: It is 
plainly false. Nicotine is a drug. It affects body chemistry and the mind, and 
smokers do become powerfully dependent on it, meaning they become addicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Any smoker or former smoker knows all this. To deny a truth that is so 
painfully evident to so many is impudent and insulting. 
</P>
<P>
 A key purpose of the subcommittee hearings is to try to find out whether 
cigarette makers manipulate the amount of nicotine in their product as a way to 
hook smokers. If the Food and Drug Administration finds that nicotine content 
is manipulated it could classify the chemical as a drug and move to regulate 
tobacco products. Compelling evidence indicates it's time for that step to be 
seriously considered.

MAKING A SATURDAY STATEMENT; A MARCH FOR MORE GUN CONTROL AND VIOLENCE 
PREVENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fifth-grader fatally shot himself in the head Wednesday at the front door of 
his Los Angeles elementary school with a semiautomatic pistol his father had 
kept under the mattress at home. Parents rushed to the school to check on their 
children, police officers and detectives filed the necessary reports and 
teachers struggled to continue with lesson plans. All were at a loss for words. 
</P>
<P>
 Another day, another senseless tragedy.  
</P>
<P>
 We wring our hands, we avoid a growing list of potentially dangerous places, 
we install metal detectors, alarm systems, more lights, more fences. We take a 
deep breath each morning as our children leave for school, praying they will be 
safe. We sprint to our parked automobiles. We cower in our homes. We shake our 
heads at the growing audacity of armed criminals, at the apparent valuelessness 
they place on life, at the ease with which everyone, including a 10-year-old, 
can lay hands on a gun. We cannot easily comprehend the frightful potential of 
the millions of guns stashed in our closets, in bedside drawers, behind store 
counters and in school bags. We feel impotent and terrified. Even worse, some 
of us are numb to the senselessness. Anger -- and determination to stop the 
madness -- is a healthier response. 
</P>
<P>
 To stand up for an end to street crime and to the easy availability of 
firearms that facilitates that violence becomes a powerful political statement. 
On Saturday Los Angeles-area residents have an opportunity to step forward and 
demonstrate how they feel about escalating gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Drive By Agony, supported by Women Against Gun Violence and the Violence 
Prevention Coalition of Greater Los Angeles, is sponsoring a march and rally 
"to show that violence is unacceptable in our community." The short march will 
begin at 10 that morning at Olvera Street Plaza and end at the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The aim of this annual march, now in its third year,is not only to remember 
victims of violence but also to stem the increase in their ranks by supporting 
more comprehensive and effective gun control and violence prevention. We can 
think of no worthier way to spend a Saturday morning.

AIDS WATCH; THE COST OF CARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The cost of caring for people with serious illnesses figures heavily in the 
national debate on health care reform, particularly when the question of 
whether employers can afford health insurance is involved. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical costs related to employees with the human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) or acquired immune deficiency syndrome long have been presumed to be 
especially high.That presumption has led to real-life stories that mirror the 
plot of the acclaimed movie "Philadelphia," in which a lawyer is fired because 
he has AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 A nearly identical allegation is playing itself out in a lawsuit in San Diego, 
and courts have awarded large settlements to AIDS victims or their survivors in 
similar cases in Pennsylvania and New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, an important study finds that the costs of HIV and AIDS to employers are 
much smaller than thought -- about $17,000 on average. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the report's authors adds that HIV and AIDS are "in the low mid-range 
in terms of overall costs to society" when compared to other catastrophic 
diseases such as cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The study was conducted under the auspices of the federal Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention by a Georgia State University health economist and a 
professor at the University of New Hampshire's School of Health and Human 
Services. Clearly this report is not the final word on the financial costs of 
HIV and AIDS cases, but it helps pierce the veil of ignorance and stigma that 
continues to surround this disease. It deserves a wide audience.

DEAD SEA SCROLLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Hershel Shanks' article, "Who Owns the Dead Sea Scrolls?" (Commentary, April 
4), failed to address the real issue of the scrolls: the immediate release of 
all scroll material in a way for all scholars to read their contents. It 
doesn't matter if the Jordanians, Israelis, Palestinians, British, or Americans 
own some or part of the scrolls.The whole world would be enriched by the 
scrolls being on exhibit in museums throughout the world. They cannot be the 
exclusive property of one religion, one people, or one culture. They belong to 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanks' Biblical Archaeology Society should be fighting all of the 
self-appointed editors who have kept most of the scrolls' contents from the 
rest of the world for the last 45 years. Of course, the Biblical Archeology 
Society did publish a large number of scroll photos in 1991, but has since then 
thrown in its lot with the "official" scroll editing team in Jerusalem. So far 
only Robert Eisenman and Michael Wise have published at least 50 of the most 
historically interesting unpublished scroll fragments. There has been nothing 
since. Why? The international lawsuits by the official self-appointed editors 
of the scrolls have tied up the scrolls' publication. 
</P>
<P>
 This is an international scandal and scholastic disaster.

</P>
<P>
 Here is the opportunity for the French Academy of Sciences to correct its 
error. It is about time that this courageous and brilliant woman was included 
in the Pantheon.Marie Sklodowska-Curie is truly among the giants of science. 
</P>
<P>
 The first person to be awarded two Nobel Prizes in science (physics and 
chemistry), she revolutionized the way we view the universe in a profound way 
and brought us into the Nuclear Age. Give her the honor she merits.

 "Now the question is whether the remains of Marie Curie's collaborator and 
husband, Pierre Curie, will join hers in the Pantheon. How delicious the irony 
if it takes a woman to bring a lesser male scientist like Pierre Curie into the 
Pantheon. He won only one Nobel Prize." 
</P>
<P>
 Pierre Curie shared his wife's first Nobel Prize but was not able to share her 
second because of his death in a tragic accident several years before.

BATES ON RANDOM SEARCHES FOR GUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As a moderate Republican, I was delighted to read the column by Karen 
Grigsby Bates ("A Little Inconvenience to Save Lives," Commentary, April 6). 
The random searches she describes to rid the state of guns would be an 
excellent way to attack crime in this state. Although such a search would 
probably be tempered by constitutional issues (i.e., the Second Amendment), a 
more realistic approach to remove all assault weapons and illegally owned 
handguns would not be a radical or fascist approach at all. Sacramento is 
already drafting legislation on assault weapons and handgun licensing that 
could support such searches. 
</P>
<P>
 As Californians, we must all face the reality that the inconveniences of such 
searches would easily be offset by the increase in business, property values 
and tourism that would result. As a physician, I fully support an attempt to 
root out the weapons of crime before they occur in the same way I give 
antibiotics to my patients to prevent their infections from overwhelming them. 
In California, crime is truly an infection that is spreading rampantly. 
</P>
<P>
 The local police, supported by the manpower of the National Guard, would 
attack illegal weapons caches in an organized and thorough manner that would 
make California a model in the war on crime. Bates clearly presents an idea 
whose time has come: that crime must be fought by all of us together, 
conservative and liberal, Democrat and Republican, and black and white. 
</P>
<P>
 KENNETH S. ALPERN 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * I do not regard armed troops patrolling our streets, stopping people at 
random and searching them for weapons as "a little inconvenient." Bates may 
regard the Constitution as a little inconvenient when advocating her police 
state, but that's a small price to pay, she thinks, for the freedom to walk the 
streets at night. Perhaps a less drastic solution would be to legalize drugs 
and make the corner drug dealer as hard to find as a bootlegger. Once we start 
trashing the Constitution, Bates may well find it's "a little inconvenient" to 
be a liberal woman of color. 
</P>
<P>
 DAVID DEMPSTER 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * I would like to congratulate The Times for your courage in allowing Bates to 
demonstrate the true liberal agenda; but, why stop there? Sending the National 
Guard into the streets to remove firearms from the hands of the citizenry by 
force is only the beginning. Let's then suspend the Fourth Amendment, which 
protects us against illegal searches, the Fifth Amendment, which assures us due 
process, the Sixth Amendment, which assures us a speedy trial, the Seventh 
Amendment, which assures us a jury trial, and the Eighth Amendment, which 
protects us against excessive bail and cruel and unusual punishment. But, if 
Bates doesn't agree with this tack, then let's suspend the First Amendment so 
we don't have to listen to her griping about her loss of rights.

JUSTICE BLACKMUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The long overdue departure of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun is 
very welcome news (April 6-7). And this time the President needs to nominate 
someone other than a lawyer as the replacement.Someone with a proven mind, 
ability and most of all common sense; all of which the Supreme Court is sorely 
lacking. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court must be made to start looking like America, and not in the 
nonsensical terms of race, gender or ethnicity, but in its diversity of 
experience and the grounding, reference and breadth of its wisdom. The 
President's choice must be a matter of picking the best brain available, and it 
doesn't matter from where -- business, science, the arts, sports even -- just 
so we get away from intellectual corruption and stagnation of the 
lawyer-politician monopoly.

 * One regrets the resignation of Blackmun from the Supreme Court. He was among 
few on the court who showed concern for the excluded, the marginal -- from the 
handicapped, the Haitians, to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be remembered for his stands on affirmative action, the separation of 
church and state and abortion rights, but above all he will be remembered for 
his approach to the death penalty. It is to be condemned, as Blackmun has said, 
because it is arbitrary and biased against the poor and blacks. With his stand 
on the death penalty, he has thrown a wrench into the machinery of death.

CONSUMPTION AND PROPERTY TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Joel Fox's "We Should Tax Consumption, Not Property" (Commentary, April 5) 
needs an update. New Hampshire isn't going to make Michigan's mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox lists us among states considering ways to abandon the property tax in 
favor of taxes on consumption. He may have had House Bill 1260 in mind, it 
being the only proposal within memory to suggest such a thing. It would have 
set a termination date on the property tax, and thrown school funding into the 
hands of a "high-level study committee." 
</P>
<P>
 The House dealt with it March 17, killing the "death knell" provision 219 to 
111. There will be a study, and all the usual consumption taxes Fox mentions 
are on the list of possibilities to be reviewed, along with a state property 
tax. 
</P>
<P>
 But the four-term legislator who filed the bill has since declared he will not 
run for reelection and, in saying so, sees a slim chance of such consumption 
taxes in New Hampshire's foreseeable future.  
</P>
<P>
 New Hampshire, it is relevant to add, is the property tax state by a 
considerable margin, depending more heavily on that source for state/local 
funds than any other state. It has neither a sales nor an income tax, is 
comfortably in the black without them, has cut its tax on business profits by a 
full percent, and is leading New England out of the recession, which hit all of 
us here in 1990 almost as hard as it hit California. 
</P>
<P>
 The property tax is not one tax, but two taxes that sometimes look alike but 
are actually quite different. The tax on homes, stores, factories -- all 
products of labor (so it is, in fact, a tax on labor) -- is the bad one we are 
working to eliminate gradually. The tax on land values, which government 
creates by its investment in services and infrastructure, is the good one. It 
collects only money to which government is entitled, by virtue of having made 
land valuable. 
</P>
<P>
 STATE REP. RICHARD NOYES 
</P>
<P>
 Salem, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fox's article ignores the fact that consumption taxes are extremely 
regressive, hit all renters and small homeowners, particularly those with 
children, very hard, and benefit mostly large property owners. The greatest 
beneficiaries of shifts from property taxes are the downtown property owners, a 
large percentage of whom are foreign corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few weeks ago The Times ran a lengthy article on home buyers being 
desperate to buy homes in areas with good schools, and paying a bonus for such 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Before conservatives support increases in our sales tax they should keep in 
mind the statement made by Adam Smith in "The Wealth of Nations": "Every 
increase in the real wealth of society, every increase in the quantity of 
useful labor employed within it, tends indirectly to raise the real rent of 
land."

A POET FELLED BY A MILLION EXPECTATIONS; KURT COBAIN: HE ROSE TOO FAST AND 
LACKED THE EGO OF A GENIUS, WHICH WOULD HAVE HELPED HIM DEVELOP A SENSE OF 
SELF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB GUCCIONE JR., Bob Guccione Jr. is editor and publisher of Spin magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I came to know Kurt Cobain well enough to tell you that he was sincere and 
incredibly honest, to a fault: He spoke without thinking about the commercial 
consequences. The much ballyhooed Nirvana "backlash" that preceded and 
enveloped their album "In Utero" was the creation of those people Cobain 
disappointed by not acting the role of rock star. Hell, when you become as 
successful as he became, you're not supposed to still be one of us. It's 
offensive to some consumer aesthetic or other to try. He wasn't supplying the 
requisite fantasy. He genuinely hated the success because he realized, with 
horror when he reached it, that it involved being an image other people wanted, 
no longer what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the part of the job description no one could prepare a guy like Kurt 
for. He didn't have the emotional structure to support the incredible weight of 
millions of peoples' expectations. Every artist wants to matter as much as they 
possibly can, but most take so long to get to that position that they develop 
their sense of self and perspective on the way. Rocks stars like Kurt are 
catapulted to positions of exaggerated importance so quickly that they can no 
more handle themselves perfectly than an astronaut can calmly walk around as 
his spaceship takes off. 
</P>
<P>
 His torment was real and so was his genius, another thing that he didn't 
understand. He lacked the ego of great genius, the self-belief, not necessary 
to make you create, but essential for you to believe that you should, to 
sustain you through the travails of being different. 
</P>
<P>
 We should not, while memorializing him, glorify or excuse that he took his own 
life or the fact that he was a heroin addict who tried, unsuccessfully, to kick 
it. But it would be just as wrong to villainize or dismiss him as an 
irresponsible screw-up. He was a tragic man and we should try to understand 
what we can never know. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the poet of this generation. It will be easy in the coming months, 
especially for older people, to downplay Kurt's significance and contribution, 
but that would be wrong. Like Rimbaud, he died too young, lived too 
unflatteringly and left too little compared with what we hoped for, but it was 
enough for him to be one of the pillars in the artistic pantheon. The horrible 
manner of his death and the anger we feel because he destroyed something we 
loved creates a cultural blood clot. Other heroes died mythical deaths. James 
Dean, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison and Janis Joplin flew too close to the flame. 
John Lennon was martyred. But Kurt Cobain blew his brains out. He pulled the 
plug on his pain and there's nothing remotely romantic or mythical about that. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching MTV's umpteenth airing of Nirvana's "Unplugged" the night after 
Kurt's body was discovered, I felt I was watching a ghost. He seemed that 
alive, that charismatic, simultaneously comfortable and painfully 
uncomfortable, insecure in front of his audience. Just that, insecure. A 
musical genius, equal to anyone in the history of rock 'n' roll but more 
delicate, finally unluckier than most of his peers, singing how "When bad boys 
die they don't go to where the angels fly, but to a lake of fire where they 
fry," oblivious to the irony that he was singing a twisted version of his own 
eulogy, or that this neutered format of acoustic grunge was the first 
opportunity for many people to understand the words to Nirvana's songs and see 
what a great writer he was, and what a great and special light has gone out.

 The conventional wisdom is still that Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and his 
Inkatha Freedom Party are crucial to the success of South Africa's first 
all-race elections April 26-28. Unfortunately, Buthelezi seems to care not 
about negotiating but about having his demands for a guaranteed and oversized 
share of power fully met. Many of his supporters are sensing this and backing 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 International mediation to quell violence that threatens the balloting 
collapsed Thursday after Buthelezi demanded a delay in the voting. A few days 
earlier, the intransigent chief was part of failed negotiations with President 
Frederik W.deKlerk, president-in-waiting Nelson Mandela and Zulu monarch King 
Goodwill Zwelithini on the elections and the future role of the Zulu monarchy. 
The more the government and the African National Congress try to accommodate 
Buthelezi, the more intransigent he becomes and the farther away he shifts the 
goalposts. 
</P>
<P>
 Each failure to agree brings more violence between Inkatha and the ANC. This 
delights white right-wingers, who use such opportunities to discredit the 
negotiations process. Last month, more than 500 people were killed in South 
Africa, more than 70% of them in KwaZulu. The atrocities included the 
executions, with automatic weapons, of whole families, even toddlers and 
infants. Each massacre leaves decent people nauseated; fear and disillusionment 
stalk the black community. A once near-uniform enthusiasm for the elections is 
fading and the number of people unsure who they will vote for, or if they will 
vote at all, is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
 South Africa's black population has paid for these elections with detentions, 
exile, imprisonment, death by hanging, death at the hands of the security 
forces, strikes, economic pain as overseas companies left South Africa and 
numberless other sacrifices since the struggle against apartheid and 
colonialism started in the 17th Century. If some areas remain so dangerous that 
voting cannot take place, the process itself will be discredited. This is just 
what the right wing wants. 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly, Buthelezi has exacted some worthwhile concessions. He forced the 
ANC to agree to separate elections for regional and national government, which 
will increase the diversity of representation. He alone won the regions 
substantial powers. He has persistently stood up to the secret deals between 
the government and the ANC, which were then shamelessly shoved down the throats 
of other players. 
</P>
<P>
 But his harm has come to outweigh his good. Buthelezi is both intransigent and 
mercurial in his demands. His party's links to the white right wing are 
hair-raising and he has refused compromise when every other political party has 
made concessions. He and King Zwelithini now demand a virtually independent 
KwaZulu. This is asking for a Zulu homeland, what Buthelezi rightfully rejected 
in the 1970s. He seeks increasing confrontation because he fears being 
humiliated by Mandela at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, time has run out on this game-playing. The political 
uncertainty, the states of emergency in Natal and KwaZulu and the continuing 
violence are hammering the economy. Foreign investors who a month ago were 
buying our stocks and securities by the bushel are now dumping them. The rand 
is diving against foreign currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse still, blacks are losing confidence in the system and the fragile 
democratic will could collapse at the slightest provocation. Giving in to 
Buthelezi will make things worse, causing a backlash from the rest of the black 
community. It is time now for the government, the Democratic Party, the ANC, 
the Pan-Africanist Congress, the smaller black parties -- everyone -- to tell 
Buthelezi: "This far and no further."

 COLOR IT BIG: The lineup for July's Orange County Fair includes more 
superstars than ever (F26). More variety too. It opens with Color Me Badd on 
July 8 and ends with Crystal Gayle on July 22. . . . In between are people like 
pianist-TV host John Tesh, the Neville Brothers, rapper Queen Latifah and 
country's Restless Heart. This year, all acts are at the Pacific Amphitheatre. 
Says spokeswoman Jill Lloyd: "We've spent more money this year trying to 
provide more top entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
 ANOTHER LOOK: The family of Gloria Ramirez, who died at Riverside General 
Hospital in February on the same night that mysterious fumes forced evacuation 
of its emergency room, has hired forensic pathologist Richard Fukumoto of 
Orange County to conduct a private autopsy today, now that her body has been 
released to them (A3). Fukumoto is a veteran of the autopsy table. He has 
performed thousands of autopsies for the county since the early '60s. Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Bryan Brown has said of him: "We're blessed in this county, but 
Fukumoto is just the best there is."

 CODY'S MOVIE: A funny thing happened when Madison Allen of Laguna Niguel 
boarded his 1-year-old wolf-hybrid dog Cody at a friend's kennel in Corona last 
year: Cody got discovered. Producers wanted him for "White Fang 2" -- a sequel 
-- which opens at 20 theaters in Orange County today (F6). . . . Allen, a 
22-year-old Saddleback College student, says he loved being on the movie set in 
Canada last year: "Cody loved it too. They train by food reward, and he got to 
eat all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 RED FLAGS: If you see someone at work wearing a red plastic nose today, it has 
nothing to do with this being deadline day for taxes. Red Nose Day USA is to 
call attention to sudden infant death syndrome. . . . Booster Leighann Faley of 
Mission Viejo has been raising funds selling those noses -- and badges that say 
"I'm too chicken to wear a red nose." Says Faley: "You're going to see red 
noses all over Orange County today."

 STATUS QUO: CSUN students Wednesday were obviously not in the mood for any 
major changes. They overwhelmingly opposed the idea of switching the school's 
nickname from "Matadors" to "Quakes," and narrowly voted against an increase in 
athletic fees (B3, C4). . . . Meanwhile, school officials say they'll try the 
fee proposal again this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 STAYING ALIVE: Score one round for the poor pigeons of Glendale. But the 
battle is far from over. City officials had planned to trap and kill the 
downtown birds, but residents and animal rights activists saw it as foul play 
and got the city to call it off. . . . So, instead, officials say they now 
favor non-lethal methods of pigeon control such as repellents, netting or 
plastic owls or falcons (B1). 
</P>
<P>
 BULLET: There's no crying in baseball, everyone knows that. But there's 
certainly some Cress. Missy Cress. The former CSUN softball star (above) has 
made the all-woman Silver Bullets, which will crisscross the country this 
summer playing hardball against men's minor league and semipro clubs. . . . 
"It's so exciting, but it's so hard," she said. "I never thought I would play 
baseball." (C1) 
</P>
<P>
 FILM DEAN: CalArts took its sweet time. Two years, to be exact. But it found 
the right man. He's Hartmut Bitomsky, who became the new dean of the school's 
film/video department last fall. . . . Bitomsky, a highly regarded documentary 
filmmaker from Germany, welcomed the opportunity. "In a way, it was the last 
chance to do something very different," he said. See Valley Life! Page 3.

<P>
 BASHING TIME: She's not Japanese, and she's not 400 pounds. So what? 
Free-lance writer Cindy LaFavre Yorks found out anyone can sumo wrestle. 
Actually, it's called sumo basho, a modified version of the popular Japanese 
sport. And, believe it or not, you can do it at a restaurant in Burbank. . . . 
Yorks, hardly the aggressive type, couldn't wait to basho her opponents. See

 TAX TIME: Attention procrastinators! Only three post offices in Ventura County 
will extend their hours tonight to accommodate late-filing taxpayers. . . . The 
much sought-after April 15 postmark is guaranteed until midnight only at the 
main post offices in Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley and the Oxnard branch on C 
Street. All other post offices will keep normal hours. Customer service manager 
Tom Casebeer expects a bigger than usual rush, given the economy: "People 
figure, if they owe money, they will wait until the last minute." 
</P>
<P>
 FAME AND FORTUNE: It's a career break that most lawyers only dream about. . . 
. First, Oxnard lawyer Mark Hiepler sued an HMO over denying a bone-marrow 
transplant to his sister Nelene and won a whopping $89-million judgment. Then, 
he received nationwide publicity, had a White House meeting with the President 
and tonight gets top billing on ABC's "20/20." But Hiepler's planning no office 
party. He describes his victory as bittersweet, given the loss of Nelene to 
breast cancer: "I would gladly trade all this for a few more months with her."

 HUMAN CHRONICLES: Ray Bradbury, the science fiction writer known for his 
inspirational speeches, will speak at Moorpark High School at 7 p.m. Wednesday. 
Last year, the author of "Martian Chronicles," and "Fahrenheit 451" filled the 
gym and raised $2,000 for the school library by selling his books and donating 
the profits. It's the second year that Margaret Blakelock, an enthusiastic 
English teacher, snagged Bradbury. She said: "He has a great sense of humor."

 UNITED THEY STAND: A group of former Ross Perot supporters in Thousand Oaks 
has found a candidate to challenge Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) 
in the fall. . . . The United We Stand chapter is supporting political newcomer 
Rhett Wooden, a Thousand Oaks film cameraman. But first, Wooden's backers must 
collect 10,000 signatures to get his name on the November ballot. Wooden, 43, 
say he's ready: "Somebody's got to do it."

KALASHNIKOV GETS $80 RUSSIAN PENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Boris N. Yeltsin has granted a monthly pension of $80 to the rifle 
designer whose name became a byword from Vietnam to the plains of Central 
Europe -- Alexei Kalashnikov. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's administration said the 74-year-old inventor of the Kalashnikov 
rifle would receive a payment of 145,000 rubles, equivalent to 10 times the 
minimum wage, for "special services to the Motherland." 
</P>
<P>
 The pension is considerably higher than average, but low by world standards 
for a man who designed guns that revolutionized the world arms market. A 
standard Kalashnikov rifle sells now for about $300 on the Moscow black market.

SACRAMENTO FILE: BILL WOULD LIMIT PUBLIC FUNDS FOR JUDGMENTS AGAINST OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Assembly has passed legislation prohibiting the use of public funds to pay 
judgments against elected officials who are sued for trying to influence the 
outcome of judicial proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 A 47-8 vote sent the bill (AB 2467) by Assemblywoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del 
Rey) to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure stems from $1.2 million in damages that Los Angeles County was 
ordered to pay last year as a result of charges that Supervisor Mike Antonovich 
tried to influence the outcome of a lawsuit by making a telephone call to a 
judge in charge of a case. The county has appealed the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The underlying lawsuit involved a dispute between two small businessmen, one 
of whom was an Antonovich campaign contributor.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; TOPPLING TREES, AND HARMONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People move to Orange County for various reasons: schools, jobs, the suburban 
lifestyle. And they pick their houses for various reasons: the ocean, nearby 
parks, mountain vistas. 
</P>
<P>
 Within Laguna Niguel's 151-home condominium association called Potomac 
Landing, the folks on the top of the hill picked their units for the ocean 
views, and paid an extra $100,000 or so for the seascape. Residents on the 
lower levels loved the eucalyptus trees, which provided shade, privacy and 
something for children to climb. The problem was that the trees grew to heights 
of 30 feet and blocked the ocean views. 
</P>
<P>
 This week the association's recently elected board of directors -- arguing 
that besides blocking the views the trees were expensive to tend and posed a 
fire hazard -- hired a tree service that felled 200 of them. The action 
provoked a furor. One homeowner brandished a shotgun -- he said it was unloaded 
-- at the tree cutters. Neighbors quarreled bitterly. Sheriff's deputies were 
called. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's decision to cut the trees was reached in a closed-door meeting, a 
foolish way to decide matters affecting hundreds of people. Homeowners are 
concerned about not just the economics of their major investment; they are 
emotionally attached to the place they call their own. Condominium boards often 
find it difficult to win majority approval for anything controversial, but they 
nonetheless must discuss troublesome issues publicly. Secret decisions just 
fuel the anger of those on the losing side. 
</P>
<P>
 The larger lesson is that while people may move to Potomac Landing and other 
communities in a search for a piece of paradise, they often find the problems 
that are common to people almost everywhere, like the need to get along with 
the neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Poet Joyce Kilmer wrote that "only God can make a tree." The homeowners found 
out what can happen when chain saws cut trees down. Acacia saplings have been 
promised to replace the eucalyptus. It will take them a long time to be fully 
grown. May the bad feelings among neighbors heal long before.

 Al Leiter sat on the Toronto Blue Jay bench Thursday night and couldn't help 
himself. He was not exactly rooting against his teammates, and there certainly 
was no joy in the 6-4 loss to the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 But on this night, there was not a soul who could blame him for praying for 
his his older brother's success. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Leiter, who his teammates say has more courage than they can imagine, 
stymied the Blue Jays' powerful lineup for seven innings and gained his first 
victory as an Angel. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be easy to say this victory was for Ryan, his 9-month-old son who 
died 10 days ago, but that, Leiter said, would be trivializing the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to dedicate this game, or any game, to Ryan," Leiter said. "I'm 
dedicating the rest of my life to Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ryan is the son I lost. There isn't a win, a no-hitter or a World Series 
championship that can make up for the loss of my son." 
</P>
<P>
 Leiter, facing the one American League team he had never defeated, yielded 
seven hits and three runs (two earned) in seven innings. It appeared that all 
he would get was a no-decision -- leaving with the score tied, 3-3. But he 
happily watched his teammates come alive in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Damion Easley, batting leadoff in place of the slumping Chad Curtis, broke the 
game open with a two-out homer over the left-field fence. Jim Edmonds, playing 
first base for the first time in his career after Eduardo Perez suffered a 
sprained left shoulder, followed with a single to center. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Salmon, who hit a three-run homer in his previous at-bat in the fifth 
inning, knocked Blue Jay starter Juan Guzman out of the game with a double to 
left. Chili Davis greeted reliever Woody Williams with a run-scoring double 
that bounced into the right-field seats for a 6-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Jays still managed to make it interesting for the 21,243 fans at 
Anaheim Stadium when they loaded the bases with none out in the ninth off 
reliever Joe Grahe. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Carter, the hero of the 1993 World Series, then hit a sacrifice fly to 
right field. When Salmon's throw skipped past shortstop Gary DiSarcina, Paul 
Molitor aggressively tried to take second. Third baseman Easley picked the ball 
up, threw to DiSarcina covering the bag, and Molitor was out for the double 
play. The game ended when John Olerud fouled out to Edmonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, my brother is pretty special," said Al Leiter, who also is a 
starting pitcher. "He's going to grieve throughout his life. It's good for him 
to get on with his life (rather) than dwell on other things. I think his wife 
(Allison) will need more support, and need help, but I think Mark will be all 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mental things that you go through as a baseball player will help. This is 
excellent therapy." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mark: "I wasn't so sure I did the right thing (pitching) in Milwaukee, 
but I got a lot of letters from people who said, 'You're doing the right 
thing.' Now, I'm sure I did." 
</P>
<P>
 These times are still painful, but Leiter never has backed down from a 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 He had three shoulder surgeries in 17 months, not even touching a ball for 
three years, then returned to baseball. He spent nine years in the minors 
before he made the big leagues to stay. He pitched against the Blue Jays as 
well as anyone this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not too easy," Blue Jay hitting coach Larry Hisle said, "because this 
lineup just doesn't have any weaknesses." 
</P>
<P>
 It was only a fluke that the Blue Jays were able to score their first two runs 
in the first inning. Molitor hit a two-out single in the first when Carter came 
to the plate. He hit a flare that just dropped over DiSarcina's glove into 
shallow left field toward the foul line. 
</P>
<P>
 Left fielder Bo Jackson tried to pick up the ball, bobbled it, and Molitor 
kept running until he scored while Carter reached second. Olerud followed with 
an RBI-single to left.

PIAZZA, DODGERS AT A LOSS; BASEBALL: STAR CATCHER FAILS IN POTENTIAL GO-AHEAD 
AT-BAT WHILE CONTINUING TO STRUGGLE IN A 9-8 DEFEAT AT ST. LOUIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Mike Piazza doesn't know why this is happening; he simply knows that it is. 
</P>
<P>
 He can't hit, no matter how hard he tries, which could be too hard. 
</P>
<P>
 He swings at bad pitches, something he seldom did last season. Thursday 
afternoon at Busch Stadium, he swung at a really bad one, leaving what would be 
the tying and winning runs on base as the Dodgers lost to the St. Louis 
Cardinals, 9-8. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to look at the positives -- there's not much there, but what can I 
say?" Piazza said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is pretty tough, but hopefully you can learn as much as you can by going 
through something like this. I've gone through slumps before, but at this level 
everything is amplified and there is no place to hide, especially with my 
position on this team." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday was supposed to be a day off for Piazza, a time for him to clear his 
head and give his .091 batting average -- it's now at .086 -- a rest. But the 
Dodgers, trailing, 9-2, after six innings, rallied for five runs in the eighth 
inning and another in the ninth. Piazza, pinch-hitting in the eighth, flied out 
to the warning track in right field, then stayed in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 With two out in the ninth, Raul Mondesi on second and Tim Wallach on first, 
Piazza came to bat again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said at the beginning of the ninth inning that if Mike's turn to bat comes 
up, we win the game," Manager Tom Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not this time. Against reliever Mike Perez, who had been flawless in his three 
save appearances, Piazza battled to an even count. Then he swung at a high 
fastball, and the walk back to the dugout was a long one. Perez had his fourth 
save. 
</P>
<P>
 Delino DeShields understands what Piazza is going through. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hit .238 my second year (in the majors), and I said it was never going to 
happen to me," DeShields said. "If you would have told me it was going to 
happen, I would say, 'Never!' " 
</P>
<P>
 During the winter, Piazza became the most celebrated rookie of the year the 
National League has had in some time, and clearly the biggest attraction the 
Dodgers have had since 1991, when Darryl Strawberry was signed as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza's photograph was on the cover of nearly every preseason baseball 
magazine as well as buses and billboards all over Los Angeles. And he continued 
to show his power in spring training, hitting better than .400 with nine home 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
 But in nine games since the season started, Piazza has struggled. Pitchers who 
faced Piazza last season aren't about to throw him anything good if they can 
help it. And, right now, Piazza probably couldn't hit it anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think (the Dodgers) want any more from me than I want for myself," 
said Piazza, who has three hits in 35 at-bats. "I will work just as hard, no 
matter where I am hitting in the lineup, because I still have to respond.  
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda, trying to get his entire team to respond, shook up the batting order, 
benching Piazza and DeShields, who had asked for the day off because of a sore 
thigh muscle. Wallach, batting cleanup, responded by going three for five, 
including a double and home run, with four runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 But not much happened against Cardinal starter Allen Watson (1-0) until the 
eighth inning, when he was tiring. By then, the Cardinals were ahead, 9-2, 
having scored six runs against Pedro Astacio (0-2) and three off Chan Ho Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Gwynn, pinch-hitting for Park, got the first of five hits as the Dodgers 
batted around and scored five runs. Wallach, who had homered in the sixth, hit 
a two-run double off the left-field wall, moving the Dodgers to 9-5. DeShields, 
also pinch-hitting, lined a two-run single through the hole in left. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ninth, Wallach grounded through the hole at third, scoring Brett Butler 
and moving Mondesi to second. And up stepped Piazza. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will continue to work extra hard and take extra batting practice and, 
hopefully, become a better player because of this down the line," Piazza said. 
"Hopefully, I will have more than 30 at-bats in my career. Like I said, the 
timing is not there, and it's one of those things I have to battle through."

NBA ROUNDUP; KNICKS MOVE TOWARD GOAL, BUT IT'S STILL FAR AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was no champagne, even though the New York Knicks clinched their second 
Atlantic Division championship in a row Thursday night with a 111-106 victory 
over the Washington Bullets at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 A division title wasn't exactly their goal back in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a nice accomplishment, but our minds are far ahead of that," Coach Pat 
Riley said. "We have to keep our eyes completely focused on the goal." 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is the NBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've won our division. Hooray, hurrah," said Rolando Blackman, who is only a 
season off the roster of the Dallas Mavericks, for whom every victory is cause 
for celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure we're having a good season, but we've got much more work to do. We have 
higher aspirations." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Ewing had 33 points and 13 rebounds and Blackman's three-pointer with 
61 seconds left broke a tie and enabled the Knicks to end a three-game losing 
streak. They also pulled even with idle Atlanta in the race for the best record 
in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to win that, but all that really means is that we're home if 
there's a seventh (playoff) game," Riley said. "It didn't help us last year 
(against Chicago) because we didn't get to the seventh game." 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 104, Sacramento 99 -- Hakeem Olajuwon scored 34 points at Houston and 
the Rockets set a franchise record with their 56th victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets, who also got career highs of 30 points and 14 rebounds from 
Robert Horry, won their sixth game in a row and defeated the Kings for the 23rd 
time in 24 games in the Summit. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte 112, Orlando 108 -- Alonzo Mourning, overshadowed statistically by 
Shaquille O'Neal, made the biggest shot of the game as the Hornets won at 
Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 Mourning made a 15-foot jump shot over O'Neal, who had scored 12 consecutive 
points to trim the Hornets' lead to 109-107 with just under a minute to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte won its fifth in a row and pulled within 2 1/2 games of the Miami 
Heat for eighth place in the East. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal led Orlando, which had a four-game winning streak snapped, with 37 
points and 16 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 101, San Antonio 90 -- Karl Malone scored 23 points and Felton Spencer 
had 22 points and 17 rebounds at Salt Lake City as the Jazz completed a 
five-game sweep of the season series against San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer capped a 9-0 run with a three-point play as the Jazz turned a 76-74 
edge into an 85-74 lead with 8:06 left. 
</P>
<P>
 David Robinson scored 31 points for the Spurs, but he had only six in the 
fourth quarter before fouling out with 3:19 remaining. Vinny Del Negro scored 
15 points, but only three in the second half for San Antonio, which fell four 
games behind first-place Houston in the Midwest Division race. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State 113, Portland 108 -- Latrell Sprewell scored eight of his 27 
points in the fourth quarter to help power a 32-17 surge that led the Warriors 
at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory moved the Warriors one game ahead of the Trail Blazers into sole 
possession of the sixth playoff spot in the Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprewell gave Golden State, which trailed 91-81 going into the fourth quarter, 
its first lead of the game, 101-100, with 5:54 remaining. Portland led by as 
many as 16 in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
 Clyde Drexler led the Trail Blazers with 29 points and Harvey Grant finished 
with 21.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART; ROME OWNS UP TO MISTAKE BUT HAS TO LIVE IT DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the cameras hadn't been rolling when a 6-foot-5 quarterback overturned a 
table and pushed a 5-10 sportscaster to the floor, it probably would have been 
an item somewhere in the back of the sports pages. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 30-second sound bite of the battle of the Jims -- Everett vs. Rome -- 
last week on ESPN2 made for great television. It led the 11 o'clock news on 
many stations across the country and subsequently made Page 1 sports columns 
for days. 
</P>
<P>
 And in this story that just won't go away, Everett comes off as the good guy, 
Rome as the villain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even my grandmother said she would have punched him," Everett said to laughs 
on "The Tonight Show" two days later. 
</P>
<P>
 Few besides some of Rome's hard-core followers, his "clones" as he calls them, 
have taken Rome's side. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Corsini, executive vice president in charge of programming for Prime 
Ticket, this week said he would never hire Rome. "There's no room for that type 
at Prime Ticket," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Rome's colleagues at radio station XTRA have been critical. Lee Hamilton 
said on the air the day after it happened that "Junior," his nickname for Rome, 
was "out of line." 
</P>
<P>
 A call this week to Roy Firestone drew harsh responses, even though Firestone 
is a Rome booster, having given the young, fast-rising radio sports talk-show 
host his first national exposure by using him periodically on "Up Close" on 
ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was angry when I saw it," said Firestone, who has been conducting sports 
interviews without incident for 14 years, five days a week. "It was a stupid 
thing and very unprofessional. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to treat your guests as if they are guests in your home. That's 
why they are called guests. 
</P>
<P>
 "My guests have been the life blood of my show. You develop relationships with 
your guests, and you want them to keep coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone also sees the incident as unfortunate for his protege. 
</P>
<P>
 "For most of the nation, this was their first exposure to Jim Rome," he said. 
"This is not what Jim Rome is all about. He is not simply a shock jock. For 
people to look at him as one-dimensional would be very shortsighted." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The day after the incident, Rome's excuses for goading Everett by repeatedly 
calling him "Chris," as in tennis player Chris Evert, were trite and 
unconvincing. During a conference call with television sports columnists and 
also on his radio show on XTRA, Rome said that although he regretted the 
incident, Everett had been warned what was coming, and he said he did what he'd 
done because he had been "challenged" by the quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 He only admitted that he probably shouldn't have called Everett Chris to his 
face a third time. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, after a week had passed, Rome was called to see if he had 
changed his stance. 
</P>
<P>
 His initial response was, "I don't want to talk on the phone. Can we meet 
after tonight's show?" 
</P>
<P>
 What did he have in mind? Rome had taken more media bashing in a week than 
Everett had taken in three years. So was he now looking to turn over a table on 
a critic, one he had called "Stewey the Clown," among other things, and one who 
was shorter than he? 
</P>
<P>
 No, what Rome wanted to do was totally fess up, to acknowledge he had messed 
up and messed up big time, to show that there is a human side to this 
smart-aleck 29-year-old, to say how sorry he was, and to begin repairing the 
damage that had been done to his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Rome talked about the uneasy feeling that was just starting to go away in pit 
of his stomach, about his sleepless nights, about his desire to apologize to 
Everett, about the nation's reaction to him, about how he was lucky he wasn't 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been only a week ago, but I feel 10 years older and much wiser," he 
said. "My goal now is to show the country I'm not that smug punk they saw in 
that 30-second sound bite. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still going to talk smack, I'm still going into the jungle, I'm still 
going to have an edge, but mark my word, you're going to see a different Jim 
Rome. I now know there's a fine line there and that you don't cross over that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have crossed over it in the past. I know that. I've done things that I 
shouldn't have done, like calling Monica Seles 'T-bone' (because she was 
stabbed with a knife). That was a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe this was all simply an act by a person trying to save his career, but if 
it was, then dust off an Oscar. During the entire interview, Rome couldn't have 
come across any more sincere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a grave mistake, but I learned a major lesson," he said. "It will make 
me stronger. I've been energized by this. I feel I have to start all over, but 
I'm determined to come back from this." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Firestone: "Jim faces a steep, uphill climb." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Basically Rome, who certainly isn't bashful, has good interviewing skills. And 
if he wants to hone them, he should study Firestone and Bob Costas. 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone may soften the questions, or come through the back door on a 
sensitive issue, but he gets to everything that needs to be addressed. Next to 
Costas, he may be the best interviewer in sports television. 
</P>
<P>
 Costas moved to the head of the class recently with interviews carried on 
NBC's new prime-time show, "Now." First was a probing interview with Indiana 
Coach Bob Knight and then an emotional one with Mickey Mantle, who talked about 
everything -- his drinking, the empty feeling he has because he believes his 
baseball career was cut short, and what a lousy father he was to his four sons. 
At one point, he used a tissue to wipe away a tear. 
</P>
<P>
 Costas made Mantle out to be a human being. 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone does that with sports celebrities nightly. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad part is that ESPN now carries "Up Close" at 9:30 p.m. and 12:30 a.m. 
That's fine for the West, but that's 12:30 and 3:30 a.m. in the East. With 
guests such as Bill Shoemaker coming up next week, and Barry Switzer, Troy 
Aikman and Michael Irvin to follow soon after that, the show deserves a better 
time slot.

BOOK REVIEW / SCIENTIFIC HISTORY; CAN DISEASE EXPLAIN OUR LEADERS' ACTIONS?; 
WAS GEORGE WASHINGTON REALLY THE FATHER OF OUR COUNTRY? A CLINICAL GENETICIST

<P>
 In 1928, Alfred Kroeber, founder of the anthropology department at the 
University of California, Berkeley, proposed a fascinating theory of culture, 
which he called "the superorganic." 
</P>
<P>
 Still hotly debated, his idea -- in greatly oversimplified form -- goes 
something like this: every act, every choice has, ultimately, some impetus from 
a previous experience. This process applies both to individuals and to large, 
interrelated societies. 
</P>
<P>
 We are all, in other words, the products of our personal and our collective 
histories, and if every scrap of data were fully known (which, of course, it 
never can be), there should emerge a rational explanation for what otherwise 
might be termed accident, whimsy or even free will. 
</P>
<P>
 Most scientists generally subscribe to this doctrine, inasmuch as their 
systematic search for answers is based upon the presumption of a logical order 
in the universe. Reason, more than fate, is regarded as the common denominator 
of modern existence. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Robert Marion operates very much in this tradition. In his intriguing new 
book, "Was George Washington Really the Father of Our Country?" he attempts to 
retroactively diagnose possible genetic maladies in six key historical figures 
and to suggest how these diseases might have impacted upon Western history. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, for instance, did England's King George III suffer periodic bouts of 
seeming insanity, and how did this problem affect the outcome of the American 
Revolution? The monarch suffered from an inherited form of porphyria, Marion 
tells us, which caused episodes of unpredictable pain, irrationality and loss 
of function. But for these incapacities (which can be traced both in the king's 
ancestors and royal descendants all over Europe), would the Colonies have 
succeeded in achieving independence? 
</P>
<P>
 And here's a stunner: Napoleon, who late in life seems to have gained a lot of 
weight and developed what can only be described as breasts, may have indeed 
been motivated to conquer the world because of an inferiority complex -- but 
not stemming from what most people think. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps he spent too much time alone as a child and maybe he was ashamed due 
to what one researcher euphemistically terms "organ inferiority." But what do 
you know? He wasn't short! It turns that an Austrian historian, not 
understanding that the French of that time used a different standard of 
measuring height, got confused about the not-so-little general's size and the 
error has been glibly repeated to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 Marion writes in a clear, conversational style that draws us in, and before we 
know it, even we English-major types are, against all odds, comprehending 
erudite scientific terms and theories. He educates, as do most fine teachers, 
by telling us a story that allows us to painlessly digest multisyllabic arcana 
-- in this case having to do with enzyme malfunction and genetic irregularity. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, we not only learn impressive anecdotes with which to regale 
our friends at the next neighborhood barbecue, but we finish his book -- don't 
be put off by the unwieldy title -- feeling a bit smarter about all those 
biochemical terms that have long intimidated us. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, along the way Marion set us up for a few too many red herrings: After 
basically convincing us that Abraham Lincoln looked as physically disjointed as 
he did because he had a joint-connection problem, Marion informs us that this 
probably wasn't the case. Lincoln was, apparently, simply gawky. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the speculations that don't go anywhere definitive are interesting, 
because they illuminate the methodology and rationale of any attempted medical 
sleuthing, past or present. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having settled upon a diagnosis," Marion writes, "the next question that must 
be asked is: What difference does any of this make? . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "What really must be determined is whether the presence of the features of a 
particular genetic disorder actually played any role in the formation of the 
character of the man who came out of the Illinois wilderness in early 1860 as a 
virtually unknown lawyer and, on a platform that supported his inherent belief 
that slavery was morally and ethically wrong, was elected President of the 
United States." 
</P>
<P>
 This issue is particularly relevant in the book's final section, which deals 
with John F. Kennedy. Marion persuasively argues that the very determination 
J.F.K. exhibited and honed early in his life in overcoming a serious physical 
ailment (he had a spinal problem known as Addison's disease) "reinforced Jack 
Kennedy's feeling that he was invincible, that he could accomplish any goal." 
</P>
<P>
 In such accounts, Marion weds science and history into a compound that 
provokes thought even as it stimulates curiosity.

HOME OWNERSHIP SEEN AS AN ANTIDOTE TO BLIGHT; NEIGHBORHOODS: STUDY CALLS IT THE 
KEY TO POST-RIOT RENEWAL. INNER-CITY RENTS ARE OFTEN CLOSE TO MORTGAGE 
PAYMENTS, BUT LENDING RULES ARE AN OBSTACLE. 
</P>

<P>
 Expanded home ownership opportunities are the top recommendations for 
improving conditions in Los Angeles' most neglected neighborhoods, according to 
a post-riot planning study by a coalition of multiethnic Los Angeles community 
organizations that develop subsidized affordable rental housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't stabilize blighted neighborhoods without building stake-holders," 
emphasizes the report released Thursday by the Coalition of Neighborhood 
Developers, an organization made up of 56 nonprofit grass-roots civic, church 
and economic development agencies based in Central and South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The report sets no price tag for the aid needed to help significant numbers of 
low-income residents purchase single-family homes -- nor does it downplay the 
necessity for additional inexpensive rental units in a city where officials say 
500,000 households cannot afford decent accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the report does emphasize that many inner-city residents could afford 
to purchase homes that are now rented if lending institutions were more 
flexible about their requirements for down payments and credit histories. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50% of the residents in inner-city neighborhoods pay rents near or 
equal to the median mortgage payment in their neighborhood, according to the 
report's editor, Denise Fairchild, director of the Local Initiatives Support 
Corp. office in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, unlike pricier West Los Angeles neighborhoods, where rental units have 
typically gone for 20% to 40% of the median mortgage price, renters in 
South-Central pay 60% to 80% of the median mortgage cost in monthly rents, the 
report shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key stumbling block is not (weekly wage) income but how we structure the 
financing," said Gloria Farias of the Pico Union Housing Corp., a member of the 
coalition's executive committee. "Banks have often been very slow in approving 
loans and they ask for too many things from people in these communities who 
don't have a long credit history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people who are low-income don't believe in buying a lot and owing a lot. 
But banks can sometimes see that as a negative in establishing credit." 
</P>
<P>
 The 18-month planning study was released at a news conference at which recent 
development projects of Coalition of Neighborhood Developers member agencies 
were highlighted.  
</P>
<P>
 Since 1987, coalition agencies have built 1,500 affordable rental housing 
units with the financial assistance of corporate investors who earn federal tax 
credits that more than offset their investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition's study also calls for new job opportunities and improved 
educational and recreational programs for youngsters as critical factors for 
rebuilding the city's long-impoverished neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Youth services providing an alternative to gangs, crime and drugs are a wise 
investment in communities where people under 18 years of age make up anywhere 
from 29% to 57% of the population, the study says. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the mayor's office and RLA have increasingly argued that the best 
way to revitalize inner-city neighborhoods is to nurture small businesses, the 
report argues that such an approach will fall short in "providing long-term, 
stable and high-volume employment opportunities in the near future." 
</P>
<P>
 The study calls for major employers in impoverished neighborhoods to hire more 
local residents. Of the 145 full-time employees hired after the Los Angeles 
Convention Center expansion, according to the report, only six lived in the 
nearby Pico Union and MacArthur Park neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 At the news conference, leaders of LISC, a national organization started by 
the Ford Foundation to channel private sector financial resources to nonprofit 
developers, announced a new $32-million commitment to the coalition's projects, 
including affordable rental housing, development of a commercial plaza to 
include a supermarket, and single-family housing. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, several initiatives have expanded home financing 
opportunities in neighborhoods that suffered the brunt of the spring 1992 
riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a $10-million program funded by the Federal National Mortgage Assn. and 
administered through First Interstate Bank, qualified residents of southeast 
Los Angeles County and East Los Angeles have been offered the chance to buy 
homes with down payments as low as 3%.  
</P>
<P>
 On Central Avenue in the heart of South-Central Los Angeles, Coast Federal 
Bank is scheduled to open a loan office in the historic Dunbar Hotel building 
on April 26. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Leimert Park, a loan-processing and financial counseling center 
sponsored by the Glendale-based Fidelity Federal Bank is due to open in May. 
The Operation Hope Vision Center will help needy clients build their credit 
ratings in order to qualify for first-time home purchase, according to 
Operation Hope Chairman John Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant, who founded the nonprofit banking consortium in the wake of the riots, 
said homeownership increases pride in neighborhoods and can also eventually 
provide access to capital needed to launch new businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "In most cases, start-up entrepreneurs use equity from their home as a 
leverage for starting a business," Bryant said. "And of all the structures 
burned or trashed in the civil unrest, not one of those was a home. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't burn that which you own." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the picture is entirely rosy.  
</P>
<P>
 "Even a 5% down payment is a big piece of change," said Sister Diane Donaghue 
of the Esperanza Community Housing Corp., citing neighborhoods such as 
Hoover-Adams where the annual median household income is $16,600. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, in a region where housing values have plummeted in recent years, 
prices have remained stable or increased slightly since 1990 in many inner-city 
neighborhoods. For example, the median price for a three-bedroom home in ZIP 
code 90044, a riot-wracked South-Central neighborhood between Vermont Avenue 
and the Harbor Freeway, actually increased from $120,000 in 1990 to $134,750 
last year, according to Dataquick Information Systems. Housing Needs 
</P>
<P>
 Home ownership opportunities are needed more than anything else to improve 
conditions in the city's most neglected neighborhoods, according to a new study 
by community development organizations. The map shows how the median rent 
payment in various areas compares to the median mortgage payment. Sources:

CHANGE OF SCENERY; BEACHES: BRUSHING ASIDE PROTESTS OF THOSE WHO FAVOR OPEN 
VISTAS, THE COASTAL COMMISSION APPROVES SANTA MONICA'S PLAN TO PLACE MORE 
ARTWORKS ALONG THE SHORE.

 The last thing John Farquhar wants to see between him and the sunset is a 
14-foot-tall statue of Mahatma Gandhi. 
</P>
<P>
 And his grandfather, Sen. John P. Jones, who donated the land for Pacific 
Palisades Park to Santa Monica to preserve its glorious views, would agree, 
Farquhar told the California Coastal Commission on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Farquhar's plea for the unadorned vistas of days gone by fell on deaf ears 
as the commission voted 9 to 0 in favor of a much-disputed public art plan for 
Santa Monica's coastline. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a perfect wedding of nature and art," said public-art supporter Nieta 
Fleisher, a Santa Monica resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Farquhar disagreed: "My grandfather loved to watch the sunset" and would have 
wanted it kept uncluttered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The approval of the long-range plan included the go-ahead for three 
controversial artworks for the beach area, including the Gandhi statue called 
"Avatar." 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the statue political correctness gone awry, W.G. Wells, president of 
the Miramar Sheraton Hotel across the street from the park, said in a letter 
that proponents "will turn Palisades Park into a dumping ground for the 
grotesque." 
</P>
<P>
 The other approved artworks are "Twilight and Yearning," consisting of four 
fishing boat hulls strapped to the pilings beneath Santa Monica Pier, and 
"Solar Web," a giant spider-web-like metal contraption that will rest in the 
middle of the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 16 new artworks are planned in the coastal zone, eight of them on the 
beach. Other sculptures include the existing "Singing Beach Chairs," to be 
displayed at the back of the beach north of Pico Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote by the commission settled a longstanding feud over public art on and 
around Santa Monica's beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the charge for the public art forces was artist and Santa Monica Arts 
Commissioner Bruria Finkel. It was her idea a decade or so ago to have a 
Natural Elements Sculpture Park, nicknamed NES Park, on the sand. Claiming 
victory on behalf of the people of Santa Monica, Finkel predicted that 
naysayers will learn to love the art they so disdain now. 
</P>
<P>
 Finkel's foe is Santa Monica Historical Society President Louise Gabriel. 
Gabriel and her supporters believe that art belongs in museums and should not 
be foisted on the public. After the vote, Gabriel said the people of Santa 
Monica are the losers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's outrageous," said Gabriel, who has lived in Santa Monica for 48 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Finkel says the sculpture garden complements nature and encourages public 
interaction with art. A trip to the beach "is not just sand in your sandwich," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabriel and her supporters are equally vehement in maintaining that the 
beach's natural beauty is best left unadorned. Works of art "distract from the 
magnificent scenic view of Santa Monica Bay," Gabriel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica City Council sided last year with Finkel, voting 6 to 1 for 
the comprehensive plan. Any additional artworks must go through a lengthy 
screening process and, while approving the plan in scope and concept, the 
Coastal Commission retained jurisdiction over each artwork beyond the three 
specified in the plan.

A SURVIVOR'S PAINFUL COMEBACK; WILDFIRES: AFTER FIVE MONTHS OF SKIN GRAFTS AND 
TORTUROUS TREATMENTS OF BURNS SUFFERED IN THE CALABASAS-MALIBU BLAZE, RON MASS 
STEPS OUT OF THE HOSPITAL. HIS ORDEAL IS NOT YET OVER, BUT HE SAYS FAMILY AND 
FRIENDS PULLED HIM THROUGH.

<P>
 Slowly, like a wounded soldier who had outlived the war, Ron Mass walked 
unflinchingly Thursday from a Sherman Oaks hospital where he had endured more 
than five months of surgery since being severely burned during last fall's 
Calabasas-Malibu wildfire. 
</P>
<P>
 His feet wrapped in bandages, his face, neck, arms and hands showing the 
blotchy red ravages of countless skin grafts, Mass ended a 163-day recuperation 
that was the longest inpatient stay in the 25-year history of the Sherman Oaks 
Burn Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his obvious pain, the brown eyes of the 40-year-old carpenter shone 
brightly in a flash of pride and recognition that he was indeed still alive.  
</P>
<P>
 On that November morning, Mass had rushed onto what was nearly ground zero of 
the blaze, a Topanga Canyon ranch in an unsuccessful effort to save his friend, 
British screenwriter and director Duncan Gibbins, who eventually perished 
trying to save his cat. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire scorched a wide swath of the Santa Monica Mountains, killing four 
people, charring 18,000 acres and causing millions of dollars in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Mass suffered burns to 75% of his body and spent the first eight weeks after 
the fire in a tortured half-sleep as doctors worked around the clock to salvage 
enough healthy skin to replace that which had burned away. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Christmas and then Easter passed, as winter turned to spring and the 
once-charred Malibu and Topanga canyons became green and filled with 
wildflowers, Ron Mass continued to heal. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, he moved to a nearby hospital to continue his physical therapy. 
To the applause of the hospital staff, Mass walked down a tiled corridor, out 
into the harsh sunlight and glare of television cameras. In the lot, his 
trembling right hand held by a sister he had not seen for 12 years before the 
fire, he stood silently and soaked in the adulation as if at a postwar victory 
parade. 
</P>
<P>
 In a weakened voice, Mass thanked his family and his doctors -- several of 
whom stood behind him -- for helping him reach deep inside himself to find a 
stubborn resolve not to die, not to let the flames have the final say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed by all this," he said, shooting a glance at 
his sister, Pat Anderson, who squeezed his hand. "Without the support of my 
family and friends, their being there all the time, I wouldn't have made it. I 
would not have pulled through." 
</P>
<P>
 Under a revealing morning sun, Mass showed the signs of his half-year battle. 
His black hair was matted. His face showed the pinkish blotches and veins that 
suggested that his new skin was still painfully thin. His purplish hands shook 
uncontrollably. 
</P>
<P>
 Conscious of his appearance, Mass had asked that cameramen refrain from 
close-up shots of his face, especially his burned nose and ears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ron still feels sort of funny about his looks," said friend Peter Alexander, 
who owns the 10-acre ranch where Mass once worked and lived in a trailer and 
where Gibbins had rented a small bungalow. "His most difficult moment came a 
month ago when he saw a reflection of himself in a pane of glass. He still 
doesn't want to look into any mirrors." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mass has come a long way from the morning of Nov. 2 when he was rushed to 
the burn center with what doctors say was "about a zero chance of survival," a 
patient whose feet were the sole part of his body left untouched by the fire. 
And they were later used for skin grafting. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting a 104-degree temperature, Mass began the first of 35 surgeries to 
combine donor skin with comparatively healthy skin from his chest and upper 
thighs to cover the rest of his body -- twice-a-week surgeries that became 
increasingly painful. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, there was more bad news than good. Mass developed an infection that 
caused some of the newly applied skin to slip away. "The more conscious he 
became," Alexander said, "the more he dreaded those operations." 
</P>
<P>
 As the skin finally started to heal, Mass began agonizing therapy to relearn 
how to move his wounded hands, which suffered such severe tendon damage that he 
needs help eating and writes a shaky, unrecognizable signature. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his recovery, Mass was haunted by images of his unsuccessful 
attempt to save Gibbins -- bitter scenes of flames roaring around him, melting 
the tires of his Jeep during his escape, forcing him to run the last 500 feet 
to safety with his arms held over his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He remembers that day but he doesn't like to think about it," Alexander said. 
"He doesn't like fire." 
</P>
<P>
 During his recovery, Mass was reminded of his friendship with the good-natured 
Gibbins, how Mass yelled at his rescuers that Gibbins was still somewhere in 
the fire zone. And how the director's last words to rescuers were about Mass: 
"Did they save my friend?" 
</P>
<P>
 But the most helpful tool of his recovery came when he awoke one day to see 
the faces of his long-estranged family staring over his bed. Anderson explained 
that a sister in the San Francisco area had seen a newspaper photograph of her 
brother covered in flames. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite 12 years of not knowing where Ron was living or what he was up to, the 
family rushed to his side. Mass recalls their presence as an island of calm 
amid his pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all started talking to me like we had never stopped talking, like the 
conversation had just kept going all those years," he said of his six sisters. 
"They were very supportive. They didn't bother me with questions about what I 
had been doing." 
</P>
<P>
 While doctors marvel at his recovery, Mass sees his survival as a chance to 
make up for past mistakes. And, most of all, to reunite with his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson says her brother's ordeal has taught her a lesson: "Don't ever let 
something silly come between you and your family. Do something now to make 
amends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't wait, like I did, until you almost lose them."

BOY, 10, WHO SHOT HIMSELF AT SCHOOL DIES 
</P>

<P>
 A 10-year-old boy who shot himself in the head in an apparent suicide attempt 
in a schoolyard was taken off life-support systems Thursday afternoon and died 
a few minutes later at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the boy -- whose name was withheld at his parents' request -- 
fired a single pistol shot into his temple as fellow students filed into class 
at the 49th Street Elementary School in South-Central Los Angeles on Wednesday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, who had no history of disciplinary problems, reportedly had received 
a one-day suspension Tuesday for using profanity in the classroom. He had been 
given a note asking his parents to come to the school Wednesday to discuss his 
behavior.

 "It's difficult to fathom that a note like that would create this kind of 
anxiety, unless there was something else bothering him in his personal life or 
home life," the school's principal, Lemuel Chavis, said Wednesday. "I certainly 
didn't see this coming, and I don't think the teacher did, either." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said that when the boy went home Tuesday, he apparently did not 
mention his trouble in class. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the boy apparently found the pistol where his father had hidden 
it, under a mattress. They said the boy loaded the gun with ammunition he found 
on the top shelf of a bedroom dresser and stowed the weapon in his backpack 
before his father drove him to school. 
</P>
<P>
 About 7:30 a.m., as his classmates strolled past him into the school, the 
sobbing boy pressed the .380-caliber semiautomatic pistol to his head and 
pulled the trigger, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm at a loss for words," Los Angeles Police Detective John Garcia said. It 
just kind of makes you shake your head."

FAMILY TURNS TO NEIGHBORS FOR BONE MARROW DONOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Jim Mastro woke in a daze after crashing his brand-new truck last December and 
heard a doctor's warning. 
</P>
<P>
 The deep cuts around his elbow would heal, the doctor told him, but he should 
have someone check his blood. His white blood count was six to 10 times higher 
than normal. 
</P>
<P>
 That is how the 18-year-old Camarillo man found out he had leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 Now his only hope for a cure lies in a bone marrow transplant. But first he 
must find a donor whose marrow is compatible with the complex genetic patterns 
of his. His three younger brothers don't match, and neither do his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Mastros are turning to the community, trying to raise money and test as 
many residents as they can. 
</P>
<P>
 "The doctor told me if I tested everyone in Ventura County, we probably 
wouldn't find a match for him," admits his mother, Cindy. "But we might find 
one for somebody else. I just wanted to move ahead and do the positive thing." 
</P>
<P>
 With an art-auction fund-raiser set for April 23, the Mastros join a network 
of families across the country who are building a national registry of bone 
marrow donors. 
</P>
<P>
 Started in 1987, the National Bone Marrow Program now has more than 1 million 
names and blood tests on file. Even so, thousands of families nationwide, and 
more than 100 in Ventura County, are still looking for a match, said Lynnette 
Chandler, who started a local chapter six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Mastro initially found three potential matches in the registry, but two 
have been ruled out. Even if the third donor matches all six of the antigens in 
Mastro's marrow, the individual could decline to donate. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, chemotherapy has brought Mastro's white blood count back to normal 
levels, down from 67,000 to about 6,700. "I don't want people to call me sick, 
because I'm not sick," Mastro said. "It's just something in my blood." 
</P>
<P>
 His wet suit still hangs in the garage, ready whenever he wants to surf. He 
dropped out of Ventura College after the diagnosis but has taken a job at a 
Jiffy Lube and plays in an adult softball league with his father. 
</P>
<P>
 He is planning to take his girlfriend, Ginger, to her senior prom at Camarillo 
High School next month and to the Eagles concert the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Mastro doesn't know how long the chemotherapy will stave off the effects 
of leukemia. And the treatment, in time, could weaken his organs, making his 
full recovery much more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, finding a marrow donor is just the first hurdle. What follows is a 
complex and expensive process in which doctors poison Mastro's diseased marrow, 
essentially killing his immune system. They then inject him with healthy marrow 
and keep him in isolation for two to four months. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether the process can cost $150,000 to $300,000, depending on the 
hospital. After that, the leukemia could still return within weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Mastro said she is not as concerned about paying for the treatment; 
insurance will cover most of the costs. And she is confident that her son is 
healthy enough to survive the transplant process. 
</P>
<P>
 But first they have to find a match. A simple blood test can provide the 
needed data but the analysis required costs $45. Many potential donors do not 
want to pay that much. The art auction would raise money so local residents 
could be tested for free. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve and Cindy Mastros, who were raised in Camarillo, hope to tap a range of 
friends and associates for the fund-raiser and the bone marrow registration 
drive. The couple graduated from Camarillo High School, as did Jim. Their other 
son, Jason, is a football star there. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy said she has already received a basket of checks and donations for the 
fund-raiser from nearly 30 businesses in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler, who heads the local chapter of the bone marrow program, said new 
donors typically know someone who needs a transplant. Chandler got involved 
when her daughter was diagnosed with a rare form of anemia. She estimates the 
chapter has registered more than 17,000 Ventura County residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler knows the frustration of the quest. "I've been searching for over six 
years and still haven't found a match for my daughter," she said. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The art auction benefiting Jim Mastro and others in need of bone marrow 
transplants is set for Saturday, April 23, at the Camarillo Community Center, 
1605 Burnley St. The artwork will be on view at 7 p.m., with the auction 
starting at 8. Items for sale will include works by Marc Chagall and Eugene 
Delacroix.

OPPONENTS OF SMOKING TO TARGET 2 MORE CITIES; LAWS: COALITION PLANS TO FOCUS 
EFFORTS IN OXNARD AND PORT HUENEME IN WAKE OF CAMARILLO'S APPROVAL OF A TOUGH 
ORDINANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After yet another victory -- this time in Camarillo, where the City Council 
adopted a tough new anti-smoking ordinance -- health advocates said Thursday 
they will turn their attention to Oxnard and Port Hueneme, which will consider 
similar laws later this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a four-hour-long public hearing, the Camarillo council voted 3-2 
Wednesday to adopt the tougher of two alternative ordinances, one that bans 
smoking in most public places in the city, including all restaurants and most 
other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 In voting for the ordinance, Camarillo joined a growing list of Ventura County 
cities that have adopted tough no-smoking laws -- a trend that delights 
Frederick H. Bysshe Jr., chairman of the Smoking Action Coalition of Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition, formed in 1987, has successfully lobbied for adoption of 
similar ordinances in the cities of Ventura, Thousand Oaks, Ojai, Moorpark, 
unincorporated parts of Ventura County and now Camarillo, Bysshe said. Only 
Simi Valley has declined to adopt a tougher ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very pleased and gratified by the council's actions," Bysshe said 
after the Camarillo vote. "It is in keeping with the core elements of the 
ordinances which we believe are designed to best protect the nonsmoking public 
-- those being bans in restaurants, businesses and other public places." 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition is made up of the executive directors and members of the Ventura 
County medical and dental societies and the Ventura County chapters of the 
heart, lung and cancer societies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We now are going to turn our focus to Oxnard," Bysshe said. "I wouldn't call 
what we are doing a full-on campaign, but it is our goal to see the cities in 
this county provide the protections to the non-smoker that they should." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez recently called for the City Council to examine a 
no-smoking ordinance and said he would tentatively favor an ordinance like the 
one Camarillo officials adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm leaning toward supporting an ordinance that would provide real 
protections against second-hand smoke," Lopez said. "The evidence is in and I 
think it's clear what kind of danger that second-hand smoke presents to 
nonsmokers." 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme Mayor Orvene Carpenter said he will ask his colleagues on the 
City Council to authorize city staff to begin studying a no-smoking ordinance 
at the council's May 4 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's time to look into this, and during the meeting I hope to ask 
staff to begin researching an ordinance that would be appropriate for Port 
Hueneme," Carpenter said. "I recognize the dangers of secondhand smoke, but at 
the same time, I don't want to do something that would unfairly hurt businesses 
in our city." 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike Oxnard and Port Hueneme, city officials in Santa Paula and Simi 
Valley said that they have no plans to beef up their current ordinances, which 
ban smoking in publicly owned buildings but do not affect restaurants or 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing's being considered at this time," said Santa Paula City Administrator 
Arnold Dowdy. "It's an issue that's not been raised by the council." 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, the City Council decided last October to leave its current 
ordinance in place, turning aside requests from residents to toughen the city's 
ordinance to include a ban on smoking in restaurants or other public places. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore city officials could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Camarillo council meeting Wednesday, officials had two options: 
</P>
<P>
 * A less restrictive ordinance that would have allowed smoking in restaurants 
and nonprofit bingo games so long as there were separate no-smoking rooms and 
separate ventilation systems. 
</P>
<P>
 * The ordinance they ultimately selected, which imposes an outright ban on 
smoking in all public places save tobacco shops, bars and private residences. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting before a near-capacity crowd, Mayor Ken Gose and council members 
Charlotte Craven and Stan Daily said they voted for the harsher ordinance out 
of concern for the public's health. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe now, as I always have, that this is a health issue and not a 
personal-rights issue," Craven said. "I believe this ordinance does the most to 
address the dangers and problems associated with secondhand smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 But council members David M. Smith and Michael Morgan dissented, saying they 
believed the tougher ordinance would place an unfair burden on the owners of 
restaurants and small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that most restaurants can't afford to make the changes this 
ordinance will require of them," Morgan said. "I think that we have an 
alternative here that largely achieves the same goals without imposing these 
kinds of burdens." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gose cast the final, deciding vote, saying he had thought about the 
ramifications of his action for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am still absolutely convinced that this is a serious health issue," Gose 
said. "For me, it's the only way I can justify supporting it." 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance will come back before the City Council for a second reading at 
its April 27 meeting and will become law 30 days later.

QUAKE AID FOR FILLMORE, SIMI CALLED SLOW; RECOVERY: FEMA AND SBA ARE CRITICIZED 
BY SOME WHO SAY THEY'VE BEEN WAITING MONTHS FOR HELP. BUT AGENCY 
REPRESENTATIVES SAY THEIR EFFICIENCY HAS BEEN PRAISED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Nearly three months after the magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck a sleeping 
Southern California, federal emergency aid is reaching most Ventura County 
victims, disaster officials and aid recipients say. 
</P>
<P>
 But some residents of Simi Valley and Fillmore -- the Ventura County 
communities hardest hit by the quake -- are still fighting with federal 
officials for the aid they say they expected long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley resident Mike Piper, for example, isn't sure which was more 
upsetting -- the earthquake that wreaked $60,000 worth of damage on his home, 
or the following weeks spent wrangling with federal disaster officials, trying 
to glimpse one penny of the emergency aid they promised him in late January.  
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'You've got to understand, we've got 400,000 of these cases,' " he 
said. "I said, ' You've got to understand, I can't live in my house.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But representatives of the Federal Emergency Management Agency say the 
efficiency of their response and the friendly attitude of their employees have 
won them satisfied customers across Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had people come in here, bringing us candy and cakes," said Joe 
Garriga, FEMA's spokesman in Fillmore. "When we take lunch breaks here, people 
see us with our IDs and they are very kind to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the Small Business Administration, which works with FEMA in 
awarding emergency home and business loans, say they had processed more than 
half their Ventura County home loan applications and about one-eighth of the 
county's business loan applications by April 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Brady, a spokeswoman for the SBA, said the agency tries to process home 
loan applications before dealing with business loans, figuring the home loans 
are a more immediate priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 7,556 home-loan applications filed with the SBA by Ventura County 
residents, 3,725 were processed and 2,660 loans were approved by April 5. Of 
the 869 business-loan applications filed with the SBA by county residents, 112 
had been processed and 65 loans were approved. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA figures are less precise. Officials say county residents have filed 7,723 
applications for FEMA disaster aid since the Jan. 17 quake, and they estimate 
that most residents either receive their check or an explanation of why they 
are not eligible within three weeks of their application. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore resident Irma Eyzaguirre said her grant check took two months to 
arrive, but she still has few complaints with FEMA. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA officials "were very pleasant," she said. "They reacted very quickly, I 
think, to the earthquake and to Fillmore." 
</P>
<P>
 Eyzaguirre's house suffered only minor damage in the quake. The grant check 
she received was under $1,000, or less than one-sixth the cost of the total 
damage. Still, she said, the grants are not meant to repair every crack, just 
make a house livable again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no problems," she said. "Then again, if my house had crumpled to the 
ground, I probably wouldn't have wanted to wait that long." 
</P>
<P>
 Not every applicant is satisfied with the wait or the service. Some residents 
and business owners say federal officials have lost their case files. In some 
cases, officials have sent key documents from the same file to different cities 
in different parts of the state, making applications impossible to process. 
Some complain they were awarded money with so many conditions attached that 
they could make out better at their local bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I have heard from Bill Clinton and (U.S. secretary for Housing and 
Urban Development) Henry Cisneros, they are taking their kudos far too early," 
Piper said. "They are spending a lot of their time patting their backs in front 
of the public, when those of us in Southern California are hurting, and their 
system is hurting us." 
</P>
<P>
 Piper's pain began at 4:31 a.m. on Jan. 17.  
</P>
<P>
 "The rafters came down through the ceiling like spears," he said. "The toilet 
turned upside down. And then, of course, there was all the standard cosmetic 
damage." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, his emergency relief case "has been one of those Murphy's Law type 
things," said Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), whose office has worked with 
Piper, a former Simi Valley city councilman, to get Piper's paperwork 
straightened out in the FEMA bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, weeks went by without a word from FEMA officials. So Piper started 
making phone calls on the Small Business Administration loan for which he'd 
applied.  
</P>
<P>
 Turns out, part of his aid request ended up in Pasadena and part landed on a 
desk in Sacramento. Nothing further could be done until both portions arrived 
in the same place, officials told him. 
</P>
<P>
 Calls from Gallegly's office and persistent requests from Piper eventually got 
the Pasadena package up to Sacramento -- where an employee opened it only to 
find it empty. FEMA officials told Piper he had two choices: He could either 
wait two months or so for them to locate the missing materials, or he could 
resubmit his application. 
</P>
<P>
 Piper put in yet another call to his congressman. "After being harassed by 
Elton's office, they suddenly did find my paperwork," said Piper, who on March 
28 received a package from the SBA saying that he'd been approved for a $45,000 
loan. 
</P>
<P>
 He's still waiting on the SBA loan for his quake-impacted telephone service 
business. SBA officials have lost his paperwork twice so far, he say. Officials 
say they will process his latest, faxed application within the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials say FEMA and SBA must be doing something right. Otherwise, 
local offices would be flooded with calls from irate quake victims.  
</P>
<P>
 As it is, Gallegly's office and local city halls have heard from some 
frustrated constituents. But many more, officials say, seem to be quietly 
dealing with FEMA on their own. In all, officials at Gallegly's office say, 
they have dealt with about 245 problem cases from individuals around the 
county. About 100 of those cases are still pending, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main problem I perceive," said Laura Herron, Simi Valley's deputy city 
manager, who fields most of the city's FEMA problem calls, "is people call up 
to find out the status of the application, and they're told it's pending, and 
that word pending is very vague." 
</P>
<P>
 Jess and Deana Gonzales know all about pending.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is the longest 10 days I've ever seen," Jess Gonzales grumbled nearly 2 
1/2 months after his promised FEMA grant was supposed to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Gonzaleses and their three toddlers live in a sparsely furnished, 
rented condominium atop a hill in Fillmore. The stained plaid couch, the 
children's beds, the blond wood dining room set -- -- all are donations from 
the Red Cross. The clothes on their backs were also bought with Red Cross 
money. Even the $995-per-month rent on the condo is subsidized by FEMA 
vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
 All this because the earthquake rattled their rented house into a red-tagged 
shambles. And they couldn't get at most of their clothes, or their furniture, 
and in fact their nerves were so rattled that Jess crashed his pickup later in 
the day. The resulting insurance money and the remainder of their savings went 
into buying what they call "the love boat" -- a lemon yellow, 1978 Oldsmobile 
Royale. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're more than happy with what we've gotten," Jess Gonzales said as the 
family's television, the only piece of furniture salvaged from their rented 
house, played a soap opera in a corner of the family room. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, ever since Jess, who is disabled, and Deana, who is on a leave of 
absence from her cashier's job, learned they might receive up to $12,000 in 
grant money, they have counted on the money to help them put their life back 
together. "I feel kind of cheated," Jess Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Gonzaleses feel cheated, Vernon Devitt, owner of a severely damaged 
motor home in Fillmore's El Dorado Mobile Home Estates, is pleasantly 
surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA and SBA were efficient as far as Devitt is concerned. Within two weeks of 
his application, they had mailed him grant and loan money he didn't recall 
asking for. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand what the inner workings are there," Devitt said of FEMA, 
acknowledging that he filled out lots of forms and may actually have requested 
the grant and loan money. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant, the size of which Devitt will not disclose, is sitting in the bank 
while he decides what to do with it. "I didn't know what else to do with it," 
he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Not that Devitt can't use some extra cash. His mobile home may have to be 
demolished, in which case the SBA loan money, at just over 3% interest, will 
come in handy. But he has earthquake insurance, and he expects that to cover 
many of his expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Devitt has nothing but praise for FEMA. "I was very satisfied with the 
operation the whole way through," he said. "What you have to take into 
consideration is a lot of these (applicants) are going to give bad reports 
because they're under a lot of stress." 
</P>
<P>
 Chappy Morris Sr. admits he's under a certain amount of stress, but lays at 
least part of the blame on his dealings with the SBA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their regulations and stipulations are making it impossible for us to utilize 
our money," said Morris, owner of William L. Morris Chevrolet and Oldsmobile, a 
downtown Fillmore institution that faces $2.5 million in earthquake damages. 
Morris' father started the business in 1929 on the day the stock market 
crashed, and today Morris and his two sons run the family enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris needs a low-interest emergency loan before he can even think of repairs 
on the massive scale the business requires. He's willing to put up everything 
he owns as collateral, but since he has the entire family on the ownership deed 
for estate purposes, the SBA says his assets alone are not enough to secure the 
loan.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are not asking for a gift or any subsidy, but a loan, and we are willing 
to pay interest," Morris said. "But we do not want to put everything in our 
family in jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
 Hank Carrillo, owner of yet another El Dorado park motor home severely damaged 
in the quake, decided, after waiting weeks to hear on his emergency loan, that 
the SBA's terms were so onerous he will go to a local bank instead. 
</P>
<P>
 For a loan large enough to cover the $25,000 worth of damage the structure 
suffered, Carrillo would have to pay more than 7% interest since his income is 
too high to qualify for the 3% or 4% interest rates some quake victims receive. 
Furthermore, if he accepts the loan, FEMA says, he will have to use the first 
$5,000 to pay back the grant the agency awarded him. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrillo said he's now leaning toward a local bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I was thinking, 'This is great,' " he said. "I didn't expect 
anything free. But some of the things they insinuated looked like a gift from 
the heavens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if people had been told, 'We will do the best we can and we will get 
you the answers when we can,' then that would have been OK," he said. "But 
that's not the impression I got. It sounded like very low interest rates, and 
the aid would be coming in right away. And now, immediately has turned out to 
be weeks and months."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: FAIRFAX DISTRICT; SONG, 
VIDEO PAY TRIBUTE TO STUDENT SLAIN IN CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A rap song and video called "Ban the Bullets" premiered at a Los Angeles high 
school Thursday, where a 16-year-old boy was shot to death by a classmate 
nearly 16 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The song, named for the coalition that sponsored its creation, was performed 
live at Fairfax High School by Inner City Poets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just feel that this is a good thing, because a lot of this violence has to 
stop," said Major Boy, a member of the group. "My sisters were almost killed 
last weekend in a drive-by shooting, but luckily, thank God, the bullets missed 
them. I just thank God for that. But so many kids aren't so lucky."  
</P>
<P>
 Fairfax football player Demetrius Rice was one of the unlucky. He was shot and 
killed Jan. 21, 1993, by another 16-year-old in Rice's English class. The youth 
had brought a handgun to school in his backpack. The shooting at the school 
horrified students, teachers and parents. The event was not just a tribute to 
Rice. Organizers also paid homage to Go Matsuura and Takuma Ito, college 
students from Japan who were shot to death in a Ralphs supermarket parking lot 
in San Pedro on March 25.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; COUNCIL 
ASKS AUDIT OF FEES SOUGHT BY PHILIP MORRIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council this week called for an audit of legal fees that 
a subsidiary of tobacco giant Philip Morris has asked the city to pay for its 
failed proposal to buy the Central Library. 
</P>
<P>
 Several council members said they consider the latest $221,000 bill from the 
law firms of Hunton & Williams and Morrison & Foerster to be excessive.The 
charges are in addition to $240,000 already paid to the firms, just a portion 
of the total of more than $1.3 million the city may end up paying on the 
scuttled deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a plan backed by the Community Redevelopment Agency and Mayor Richard 
Riordan, the Philip Morris Capital Corp. would have purchased the library and 
leased it back to the city in a financing gambit that might have saved the city 
as much as $11.5 million. The city would have retained control over all the 
library's operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council authorized negotiations on the proposal, but eventually 
killed it. Council members had agreed to pay $250,000 of Philip Morris' costs 
to get the deal going, but bills from the firm's lawyers now total $461,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The council agreed Wednesday to pay several related bills -- a total of 
$175,000 to three law firms that represented the city in the deal -- Orrick, 
Harrington & Sutcliffe, Grant & Duncan and Kane, Ballmer and Berkman. The City 
Council will take up the question of the tobacco subsidiary's billings in about 
three weeks, when the audit is complete.

 The Los Angeles Urban League awarded Police Chief Willie L. Williams its 21st 
annual Whitney M. Young Jr.Award on Thursday, recognizing the chief for his

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LA CRESCENTA; BOY DIES 
HOURS AFTER BEING STRUCK IN HEAD BY BASEBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 9-year-old La Crescenta boy -- who played three more innings after being 
struck in the head with a baseball -- collapsed and died several hours after 
the game, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy was scheduled to determine the cause of Timothy Richard Herman's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Lt. Ralph Martin, a friend of the family and a baseball manager in 
the Crescenta Sports Assn. league for the past 11 years, said the boy's 
parents, Robert and Karen Herman, doubted that the impact of the ball caused 
Timothy's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Timothy was wearing a batting helmet when he was struck in the 
head by a pitched ball Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "It glanced off his helmet," Martin said. "He hardly felt it. He ran to first 
base, and then pitched three more innings." 
</P>
<P>
 About three hours later, Timothy complained of a pain in his right leg and 
then collapsed, officials said. They said he was rushed to Verdugo Hills 
Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at about 11:45 p.m.

SPEAKING UP : A LOOK AT NOTEWORTHY ADDRESSES IN THE SOUTHLAND.  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Thomas Keneally, author of Schindler's List, spoke Monday at Claremont McKenna 
College. From his address: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the Holocaust's Relevance "The reason (Schindler's story) appealed to a 
novelist was that Schindler was so paradoxical. He was a great contradictory 
character and novelists like paradoxes and contradictions. The 
scoundrel/savior, virtue emerging in unexpected areas, these are the very 
subjects that novelists salivate over. Oskar was a great contradictory 
character and he remains contradictory to this day. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "They say that there's a moral failure in the West now over Bosnia. And 
possibly there is. There's a great deal of bona fide confusion, too, about what 
to do because we're not actually at war with Serbia. The question of what to do 
about what goes on in sovereign territories is one that's perplexed even people 
of good faith all along. But there seems to be something akin to the Holocaust 
in operation now in Bosnia, at least in intent. Because as Spielberg said on 
the set of 'Schindler's List' in Poland, 'I knew you wanted this film made 
earlier, but this is the best time to make it, because this is the first time 
since World War II that the term 'ethnic cleansing' has emerged again on the 
lips of government officials.' Not on the lips of some lout on a street corner, 
but on the lips of government officials. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "There are similarities between the Holocaust and what's happening in Bosnia, 
even though the Holocaust was the most thoroughgoing process of race-hate that 
we've probably seen in Europe and is morally unique specifically because of . . 
. the reduction of the process to a banal industrial mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oskar somehow dissented from that process, not only dissented but went to a 
lot of trouble to dissent, this imperfect, flawed man. And he, to talk about 
moral ambiguity, moral confusion and moral failure, he was one who didn't 
participate in what was a massive moral failure by the industrialists of the 
German empire. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Emilie Schindler, who is now 86 . . . was a hero, or heroine depending on 
your politics. She went forth and bought semolina with Oskar's money and 
hand-fed a lot of people. The women who came out from Auschwitz, many of them 
had typhus, many of them had dysentery and most of them were skeletal. A number 
of them remember being hand-fed by Emilie. . . . These were the only few square 
acres of Europe where these people were safe. Oskar's factory was shamefully, 
shamefully one of the few places in Europe where that sort of feeding was 
available. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 On Remembering the Past "Let's look at companies which are still in business 
and which were guilty of war crimes. German business had a great opportunity to 
dissent from what the SS were doing, but only a few factory owners did. . . . 
Look at Krupps, in whose plant at Auschwitz/Monewitz 25,000 young people died, 
generally teen-agers or people in their early twenties. . . . What did they die 
of? They died of exemplary beatings, they died of malnutrition combined with 
illness, they dropped on the factory floor, beaten where they fell, and so on. 
That's why chief executives of Krupps, and indeed the son of the Krupps empire, 
went to prison after World War II to pay for those crimes against humanity. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't behoove us to put pressure on the Jewish population to forget, 
because we all remember things that are much older. We remember Gettysburg, we 
remember, the Australians . . . Gallipoli . . . that's 1915. It ill behooves us 
to put pressure on the Jews to forget something that's so recent and a 
phenomenon of which Europe and indeed some Americans have not yet repented, 
that is, anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope that the Holocaust demonstrates to Gentiles, like probably most 
of the people in this room, that anti-Semitism is a dead-end. That 
anti-Semitism is not the answer to anyone's problem. That human problems are 
immensely more complicated. That economic rationalists are more responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking Ahead * Wednesday: Mike Davis, author of "City of Quartz," and Kevin 
Starr, author and historian, will discuss "The Next L.A." at the Sheraton 
Grande Hotel in Downtown Los Angeles, at noon. Their discussion will be 
sponsored by the public issues forum, Town Hall Los Angeles, (213) 628-8141.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 CHINESE DISSIDENT 
STOWAWAYS LAND HERE, AWAIT ASYLUM RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Chinese dissidents who had stowed away on a ship in Hong Kong arrived 
Thursday in Long Beach, where they were housed in a hotel while their 
applications for political asylum are processed by the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Shipping officials said the pair presented themselves to Capt. K. C. Jeon of 
the Korean container vessel two days out of Hong Kong.They carried with them 
newspaper accounts of their arrests for pro-democracy activities in Guangzhou, 
China, Jeon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two, identified as Guo-Heng Li and Song-Fa Wu, swept down the gangplank of 
the Hanji Marseilles without answering questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeon said the two had appeared in the ship's living quarters on April 1, 
saying they had been hiding in the bow as the ship made its way from Hong Kong 
to Kaohsiung, Taiwan, then headed for Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosemary Melville, director of the INS' Los Angeles asylum office, said the 
pair's applications for asylum would be processed as soon as papers are filled 
out and interviews are conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the shipping line is responsible for housing the stowaways and 
ensuring that they appear for interviews with INS officials, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their evidence that they are persecuted dissidents, Melville said, 
there are no guarantees that they will be granted asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no sweeping rules one way of the other," she said. EDMUND NEWTON

ON THE ISSUE: IMFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY'S TOPICS; A BETTER WAY SOUGHT TO DEAL 
WITH PIGEONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Despite a unanimous vote Tuesday by the Glendale City Council to contract with 
Los Angeles County to trap and kill pigeons that merchants claim have been 
dirtying the city's downtown business district, council members have announced 
they will investigate more humane methods of reducing the bird population. The 
decision comes in the wake of public criticism of Tuesday's vote and the 
disclosure that one of the county's extermination methods involves attaching 
bags of pigeons to car exhaust pipes. Residents and animal-rights activists 
argued that non-lethal alternatives exist to control the growing number of 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
 According to one national animal-welfare organization, extermination is 
largely ineffective as a means of controlling populations, although many cities 
in the United States still trap and kill pigeons. 
</P>
<P>
 Should communities attempt to reduce their pigeon populations by killing the 
birds? 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Peatrowsky, director of the Glendale Humane Society: 
</P>
<P>
 "If (the pigeons) have an unending food supply, they will continue to multiply 
at an unnatural rate. It is not against the law for (the city) to pass an 
ordinance that would stop people from feeding them. . . . (Droppings) show up 
more now because of all the glass (in the business district). They've got those 
big glass globes and they're covered. It looks terrible. The face of downtown 
has changed and there are all kinds of places for them to roost. . . . I'd 
really like to see them try alternative methods before they decide to euthanize 
them. They need to encourage people not to feed them." 
</P>
<P>
 Penny Scott, director of Balboa Park in San Diego, where the pigeon population 
was reduced about eight years ago by mixing bird feed with a birth-control 
substance: 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't need to (kill them). Birth control in the seed doesn't hurt the 
birds. It was very effective and we could probably do it again. It was very 
humane. We never would have considered (killing them). . . . We just felt that 
the most humane solution was birth control. It takes care of the problem and it 
doesn't hurt the birds. It just means the eggs don't mature and you don't have 
the babies. We don't want to eliminate the pigeons. We just want to have them 
in acceptable amounts." 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Gerstenfeld-Press, biologist for Washington D.C.-based People for the 
Ethical Treatment of Animals: 
</P>
<P>
 "There are better solutions. Fortunately, that's what (Glendale) is 
considering. More and more major metropolitan cities are realizing that 
(killing) is not an acceptable approach. Unfortunately, there are still cities 
that trap and kill pigeons. It's becoming less acceptable and it's becoming 
obvious to people that it's not an effective solution. The only way to control 
the pigeon population is to reduce the 'carrying capacity' of the environment 
-- that's the amount of food, shelter and breeding sites available to them in 
an environment. The way you reduce the carrying capacity is you look at where 
they get their food from. Pigeon feeders are not doing them a favor. . . . The 
claim is that they're a health problem and they're really not. They're an 
aesthetic problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Liddell, president of the Glendale Chamber of Commerce: 
</P>
<P>
 "The pigeon population is a significant problem for the retailers. It's the 
excrement and the damage they do to storefronts and the awnings. One of the 
best means to advertise your business is an awning and the pigeons are just 
ruining the awnings and the ledges in the front of the stores. They seem to 
congregate (downtown) because of the restaurants. It is a big problem and we've 
asked the city to do something about it. I have no interest in clubbing pigeons 
over the head or tying them to exhaust pipes, but we have to have a program 
that addresses this situation. I think the City Council has acknowledged that 
this is an issue with the public because of the outcry."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: STUDENTS JUMP FEETFIRST INTO HISTORY LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of fourth-graders from Newbury Park jumped into an earthen pit at 
Olivas Adobe Historic Park in Ventura this week and felt cool mud squishing 
between their toes. 
</P>
<P>
 It was part of a living history lesson for Cheryl Triplett's Maple Elementary 
School class to learn how Chumash Indian boys helped make adobe bricks more 
than 100 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your job is to be the mixers, just like the Chumash boys," said Doug Stults, 
an interpreter for the city of Ventura's Interactive Outreach Program. "But the 
No. 1 rule is: Don't fall down." 
</P>
<P>
 With squeals of delight from most and a little disgust from some, students 
sloshed around in a foot of mud and straw for about 15 minutes. June June Tung, 
10, who goes by J.J., was one of the most enthusiastic mixers in the bunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah!" he yelled. "It's all gooshy. This is a great field trip." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ryan Hill, 9, had a different opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is sick," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Triplett, who the children repeatedly urged to join them, said the experience 
helps history come alive for the students. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they see it in a book, it's just something they read," she said. "But this 
way, it's much more meaningful because they've experienced it." 
</P>
<P>
 The mud pit was one of three stops in the morning-long class on California 
rancho history at the Olivas Adobe. The 34 students also toured the home of the 
Olivas family and learned to grind corn for tortillas on a grinding stone. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than 20,000 students take part in this program each year," said Jonji 
Stone, who coordinates the program for the city. Class costs range from $1.50 
to $4 per student. Registration opens May 1 for classes for the 1994-1995 
school year beginning Aug. 15. For more information, call Stone at 658-4733.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: FILLMORE; CITY OKS WAIVER FOR REBUILDING HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quake-damaged homes in Fillmore that did not meet requirements for distance 
from the street or other building codes may be rebuilt as they were if work is 
begun before July 17 -- the six-month anniversary of the Northridge temblor, 
the City Council said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an ordinance adopted earlier this week, property owners whose homes were 
red-tagged will be allowed to rebuild on the foundations that existed prior to 
the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "And this will allow them to rebuild what they had, even though they are 
nonconforming uses, said Mayor Linda Brewster. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law extends for another 90 days an emergency three-month ordinance 
passed days after the earthquake that leveled much of downtown Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know there's a need for it," said assistant planner Kevin McSweeney. "The 
damage from the earthquake was mostly to our older homes, and those older homes 
were built before the current codes." 
</P>
<P>
 McSweeney said 80 residential buildings were red-tagged after the quake, and 
another 215 were yellow-tagged. But the city does not keep statistics on how 
many of those dwellings were built under nonconforming uses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Building Inspector Jack DeJong said that despite the emergency law and 
the three-month extension, much of the rebuilding has been slow in coming. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have a lot of red tags out there," he said. "Some (owners) have not 
decided whether to rebuild, and others are waiting for insurance or financing. 
We're still in a high state of unknowns." JEFF McDONALD

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: ANTELOPE VALLEY; 
STUDENT, 15, CHARGED IN POISONING OF TEACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prosecutors filed a felony charge Thursday against a 15-year-old Littlerock 
High School student accused of poisoning his English teacher by putting four to 
five drops of toxic cleaning fluid in her Diet Pepsi. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, whose name was withheld because of his age, faces a single count of 
poisoning or adulterating a food or drink, authorities said.If convicted, he 
faces a maximum sentence of five years in a juvenile detention center and an 
additional three years if it is determined that the act caused the victim, 
Susan Ennis, great bodily harm. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy is scheduled to be arraigned today in Sylmar Juvenile Court, according 
to the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Ennis, 32, an English teacher, was rushed to the hospital last week after she 
took a drink of the soda laced with dry-eraser fluid, prompting her to become 
violently ill. She was discharged from Palmdale Hospital Medical Center Tuesday 
afternoon in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies arrested her alleged assailant after students overheard him 
boasting that he had placed cleaning fluid in the soda can as a joke, sheriff's 
Sgt. Jerry Wolf said. The boy confessed to detectives during an interview that 
he had committed the act.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; LYLE 
MENENDEZ'S LAWYERS SEEK TRIAL IN 8 TO 12 MONTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lyle Menendez's newly assigned public defenders said Thursday it may be up to 
a year before they are ready for his retrial.  
</P>
<P>
 Terri Towery and Bill Weiss have filed a memorandum with Superior Court Judge 
Stanley Weisberg, asking him to set a trial date that is eight to 12 months 
from now. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need the time to go through the voluminous information," Towery said.  
</P>
<P>
 She and Weiss have been representing Menendez, 26, since last month, when his 
original attorney left the case to spend more time with her young daughter.  
</P>
<P>
 Menendez and his brother, Erik, 23, have admitted using shotguns to kill their 
parents on Aug. 20, 1989, at the family mansion in Beverly Hills. But they 
claim they fired in self-defense, believing that their parents were plotting to 
kill them.  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors want a jury to convict the siblings and recommend the death 
penalty. The defense claims the brothers should be found guilty of 
manslaughter.  
</P>
<P>
 Separate juries were unable to reach unanimous decisions in the case of the 
two young men, who have become household names in America thanks to books, 
magazine articles, "Saturday Night Live" parodies and national television 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Weisberg is expected to set a retrial date today.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; KING JURY 
CANNOT CONSIDER ENHANCED TAPE, JUDGE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During the first full day of deliberations, U.S. District Judge John G. Davies 
ruled that a federal jury in Rodney G. King's federal lawsuit against the city 
may not consider as evidence a copy of an enhanced audiotape of the beating.  
</P>
<P>
 Davies said he would not allow jurors to replay the tape because it was 
reproduced without court supervision.King's lawyers offered the tape as 
evidence that racial slurs were uttered during the beating by police on March 
3, 1991.  
</P>
<P>
 Without the tape, jurors will have to rely on a soundtrack of the videotape 
beating in which the sound is distorted by noise from a helicopter hovering 
over the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first phase of the trial, King's attorneys are asking the seven women 
and three men to award their client $15 million for his injuries. The city's 
lawyers say King should get about four times his medical expenses, or $800,000. 
After a compensation verdict is reached, the second phase of the trial will 
determine the individual liability of police officers and other defendants for 
punitive damages.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA STUDENTS DERAIL CSUN FEE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Students at the Ventura campus of Cal State Northridge derailed a plan to 
raise campuswide fees in their first-ever participation in student body voting, 
campus election officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In balloting on Tuesday and Wednesday, Ventura students voted 118 to 14 
against raising fees by a total of $40 over four years to help pay for the 
addition of two women's sports teams mandated by the state in a gender equity 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure failed by only 87 votes campuswide. Without Ventura votes, the 
measure would have passed by 17 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Those of us) doing the tally were shocked at the overwhelming opposition in 
Ventura," said Marc Blander, director of elections. "But it's understandable 
since they will probably never see or use the facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Wakelee, assistant director of the Ventura County campus, said students 
have complained in the past that they felt left out of main campus activities. 
</P>
<P>
 School administrators said they will try to place a similar proposal for a fee 
increase on the student ballot next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Failure of the measure may force the school to cut its football team to add 
the women's teams, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the same ballot, both main campus students and Ventura County students 
rejected a move to change the school's mascot name from the Matadors to the 
Quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, 1,334 students voted to keep the name Matadors, while 392 voted to 
become the Quakes. Another 172 voted for neither name. In Ventura, 99 voted to 
keep the name unchanged and 28 voted for the new moniker. Four voted for other 
names.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials from around Ventura County will discuss how local agencies will deal 
with an expected shortfall in next year's state budget at a seminar scheduled 
for Saturday in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 The public is invited to attend the luncheon meeting, which is sponsored by 
the League of Women Voters of Ventura County and starts at 10 a.m. at 
McCarthy's restaurant, 1101 E. Daily Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the speakers will be Ventura County Supervisor John K. Flynn, taxpayer 
advocate Mike Saliba and Camarillo's director of finance, Anita Bingham. 
</P>
<P>
 A key aspect of Gov. Pete Wilson's proposed $55.4-billion state budget is to 
shift a larger share of fiscal responsibility for social-service programs, such 
as Aid to Families With Dependent Children and Medi-Cal, to the state's 58 
counties. Flynn is expected to talk about how that will affect Ventura County's 
budget.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; STRATTON FILES APPEAL OVER BALLOT RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton filed an appeal Thursday with the California 
Supreme Court asking it to overturn a judge's decision to remove his name from 
the June 7 ballot as a candidate for county auditor-controller. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's over until it's over," Stratton said, adding that he hoped 
the high court would have a decision today. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Superior Court Judge William Peck ruled Monday that Stratton's 
master's degree in business administration from Cal Lutheran University does 
not qualify him for the auditor's job because the degree was not earned at an 
accounting school. William Baker, a certified public accountant and one of five 
other candidates for auditor-controller, filed a lawsuit challenging Stratton's 
qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the 2nd District Court of Appeal in Ventura upheld Peck's 
ruling, prompting Stratton to take his case to the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Local election officials are anxious for a decision by the state Supreme 
Court. The county must start printing sample ballots by Monday to meet a state 
mandated deadline for mailing sample ballots to voters, officials said. CARLOS

MORE FAMILIES TO BE MOVED IN DDT CLEANUP; POLLUTION: DURING HEATED MEETING, 
RESIDENTS OF TORRANCE-AREA NEIGHBORHOOD CRITICIZE THE EPA FOR NOT PAYING MORE 
ATTENTION TO POTENTIAL PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the residents of a 
DDT-contaminated neighborhood near Torrance edged toward agreement on Thursday 
on a plan to clean up tainted soil in two back yards. 
</P>
<P>
 As officials prepared for a tense meeting that wound up drawing more than 200 
people, EPA officials said they had decided to increase the number of families 
the government would temporarily relocate for the project, which was postponed 
this week because of the community's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighborhood environmental group had demanded that the government pay to 
temporarily house 17 families during the two-week excavation of two back yards 
on a modest block of West 204th Street. EPA officials already have moved three 
families to hotels but said Thursday they would raise the number to five and 
decide early next week whether to move the other 12 families, as the group, the 
Del Amo Action Committee, has requested. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that the number of people we've already agreed to relocate is 
satisfactory and is fully protective," said Nancy Lindsay, chief of the 
Superfund enforcement branch at the EPA's regional office in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the community is asking us is to go beyond that, to be more protective. 
We're listening because we need to build some trust and credibility with this 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 That message came across loud and clear at Thursday night's public meeting, a 
sometimes vitriolic gathering that had been organized by the EPA. Many 
residents voiced anger that the agency had not paid more attention earlier to 
their concerns about potential health problems from chemical contamination in 
their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 West 204th Street, a working-class neighborhood alongside an industrial 
complex, is flanked by two toxic waste sites, and some residents believe the 
current soil contamination problem may have migrated from one of them, a 
federal Superfund site where DDT was once manufactured. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA official John Blevins told residents at the meeting that the high levels 
of DDT in two back yards may be an isolated "hot spot" rather than a sign of 
widespread contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole neighborhood's a hot spot," retorted resident Jessie Frame, who 
demanded that the EPA quickly test other back yards. 
</P>
<P>
 It was that sort of sentiment that earlier this week prompted the agency to 
postpone the soil cleanup, a move that Lindsay said in an interview was rare 
for the EPA. The excavation had been planned for weeks, but neighborhood fears 
increased sharply after the news last week that DDT levels in two yards were 
more than seven times higher than earlier tests had shown, and as much as 45 
times higher than levels considered safe. 
</P>
<P>
 The new findings prompted the occupants of the two properties -- Cynthia 
Babich and Guillermo Aguirre -- to refuse to sign agreements for the EPA to 
proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 The two renters and their neighbors voiced concern about the project's safety, 
demanding that a wind screen be built around the cleanup site to contain 
contaminated soil -- a proposal that the EPA agreed this week to study. The 
residents also banded with a community group to lobby for more relocations, 
contending that other residents could be downwind from DDT-laden dust. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Thursday night meeting, other residents blasted the EPA for what they 
called a too-hasty plan to remove the DDT, while still others called for blood 
tests and other health screening, and for permanent relocation of families 
closest to the tainted back yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Some told the EPA they have had recurring problems with rashes, headaches, 
stinging eyes, nosebleeds, nausea and breathing difficulties. They questioned 
if chemicals from the two nearby toxic waste sites could be at fault. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials said they are reviewing health problems in the neighborhood and 
promised to test the soil from 100 to 300 back yards in the area later this 
year to assure that the DDT contamination is not widespread.

FLOWER MAY SINK GOLF PROJECT; RECREATION: PUTTING A CHAMPIONSHIP COURSE IN BIG 
TUJUNGA WASH WOULD HARM THE ENDANGERED SLENDER-HORNED SPINEFLOWER, WILDLIFE 
SERVICE RULES. THE DECISION MAY KILL THE $50-MILLION DEVELOPMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal wildlife officials have ruled that a proposal to build a championship 
golf course in Big Tujunga Wash, one of the most environmentally sensitive 
areas in Los Angeles, would jeopardize endangered wildflowers found there. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-awaited decision by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service deals a blow 
to plans of Cosmo World Inc. to build an 18-hole course in Big Tujunga Wash, 
situated in the extreme northern part of the city of Los Angeles. The area is 
marked by rugged terrain and, during rainy periods, fierce flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling increases the likelihood that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 
which has jurisdiction over the wash, will not issue the permit needed for the 
$50-million project as it is currently planned, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing that says they can't override our biological opinion, but 
they rarely do," said John Hanlson, a wildlife service biologist who has worked 
on the Cosmo World golf course project for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer is now studying the decision and deciding what to do next, said 
Mark Armbruster, an attorney for Cosmo World. A Cosmo executive did not return 
phone calls Thursday. Officials with the Corps of Engineers also did not return 
phone calls about the status of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it makes it very clear that there won't be a development here," said 
state Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), whose district includes the wash. "A 
lot of us in the Valley consider the wash to be a significant open space. It's 
the last free-flowing river in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, with the developer's eyes opened by this decision, I want to sit down 
with him and with the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and see if we can't 
put the wash in the hands of the park system." 
</P>
<P>
 Cosmo World, owned by Japanese business magnate Minoru Isutani, has owned 
numerous golf properties in Japan. But the company's luck with golf ventures in 
California has been bad, starting with its $841-million purchase of the Pebble 
Beach resort near Monterey in 1990. After two years, Cosmo sold the Pebble 
Beach property at a reported loss of $341 million. 
</P>
<P>
 At Big Tujunga Wash, Cosmo planned to build a championship golf course that 
developers said would be so stunning and challenging that it would lure the 
L.A. Open from its longstanding venue at the Riviera Country Club in Pacific 
Palisades. The company developed a cadre of supporters in the Sunland-Tujunga 
area who claimed that the golf course would give their communities a 
much-needed economic boost.  
</P>
<P>
 But biologists for the wildlife service concluded that construction of the 
course "is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the slender-horned 
spineflower." 
</P>
<P>
 A federal endangered species, the tiny spineflower grows in alluvial scrub 
habitat, which is itself a rapidly disappearing ecosystem. The Big Tujunga Wash 
area is also identified in the city's General Plan as one of half a dozen 
"ecologically important" areas. Another is the Ballona Wetlands in Marina del 
Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 To protect the golf course from being devastated by flooding, Cosmo proposed 
channeling and deepening Big Tujunga Wash. But this system of waterworks -- in 
conjunction with the existing Oro Vista levee -- would interrupt the periodic 
flooding of the acreage where the spineflower grows. Such flooding is critical, 
the biologists have contended, to the spineflower's existence. 
</P>
<P>
 To answer the agency's concerns, the developer had proposed setting aside 78 
acres within the golf course as a spineflower preserve. But this proposal, the 
biologists said, would be inadequate to sustain the population and would be 
"bisected by golf course features and a (golf) cart path." 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, Cosmo offered to try growing spineflower plants on a 100-acre 
site downstream from the golf course. But wildlife agency biologists asserted 
that there is no assurance that the spineflower would survive replanting. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the only way to build a golf course on the Cosmo site and save the 
spineflower would be to establish a 203-acre spineflower preserve next to the 
wash that would be "adequately buffered from direct or indirect effects of golf 
activities" and deeded to "a responsible public or private resource management 
entity," according to the agency opinion.

 "A ny way you can . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 It was chilly, but not cold enough for the long leather and fur coats worn by 
the people who made their way past Roger and into the white stucco building 
just behind him. But this was Georgia, the swanky, celebrity-studded restaurant 
on Melrose Avenue where the hip and the not-so-hip come to dine. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger, 16, watched glumly as the parking attendants, dressed in bright red 
vests, white shirts and black pants and black ties, dutifully took charge of 
such prized possessions as a jade green Range Rover, a silver Jag, a red 
Ferrari, a black Porsche and lots of Benzes. 
</P>
<P>
 It was about 9 p.m. On the adjacent corner, people were flowing into Matty's, 
an Italian restaurant owned by actor Tony Danza's brother. Across the street 
was Spike Lee's Joint and Mo' Better Meaty Meat Burgers, all lit up in colorful 
neon. Melrose was poppin', and in the flurry, Roger went almost unnoticed -- 
just a skinny, nondescript black kid trying to sell overpriced candy to 
overstuffed adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything I have to do . . . "  
</P>
<P>
 Roger is not alone. There are scores of children like him. 
</P>
<P>
 You've most likely seen them, some as young as 12, standing outside the 
automated bank teller machines, the video stores, the drugstores, the grocery 
stores, hawking $5 candy that their sponsors bought for a buck at a 99-cent 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 They say they are with some organization that sponsors free trips and 
excursions to help inner-city kids. That's usually not true. Mostly likely, 
it's just some adult working an old hustle who needs kids to make it work. The 
kids will tell you that they are trying to stay away from drugs and gangs. 
That's true. They are kids from poor families and gang-infested neighborhoods. 
Like Roger, they need a way out of the madness. 
</P>
<P>
 So, they follow the flyers posted in their neighborhoods promising "Jobs For 
Kids, 12 to 15 years old. Work Evenings and Saturday. Make up to $75 a week. 
Win Free Trips, Bonuses, Prizes." Sometimes, there are rare individuals like 
Roger's sponsor, Clayton, who actually follow through with the promises. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clayton's really in it for the kids," says Roger. "I've been with five 
organizations. Only two were legitimate. Clayton's not legitimate either, 
really, but he cares about us. He takes us to Magic Mountain, he gives people 
prizes, he takes us to dinner. He's trying to help. We need something. And 
right now, this is all we've got. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything you need to survive . . . "  
</P>
<P>
 Roger is a fixture outside of Georgia on Melrose. 
</P>
<P>
 "Excuse me sir, would you like to buy a box of candy to help kids stay out of 
gangs and off drugs?" comes the spiel. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger sells his candy, but hates it. He hates peddling his poverty to a bunch 
of well-dressed strangers. "It's embarrassing," he mumbles. "I'm too old for 
this. I'm ashamed to tell my friends and my girlfriend that I work here. My 
girlfriend and my homeys think I work inside." 
</P>
<P>
 But he's there almost every night. Some 20 job applications, including one at 
Georgia, have so far been fruitless. He's been doing this since he was 12 years 
old. These days, he says, it's not so much for the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, Roger just doesn't want to go home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything I can . . . "  
</P>
<P>
 Home, you see, is where the hurt is. It's a three-bedroom apartment where gang 
members hang on the steps drinking and smoking dope. It's where you get hassled 
and robbed and chased. It's where graffiti covers most buildings on the block 
and there's always trash in the street. It's a place of bad memories. 
</P>
<P>
 Dad is in jail, so is Roger's older brother. "He was trying to be like my dad, 
selling dope and stuff like that. I don't even think about them anymore." Two 
sisters, 4 and 14, are at home with his mother, now receiving a welfare check 
from the Department of Social Services, the place where she worked as a typist 
less than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 So, Roger doesn't go home much. 
</P>
<P>
 "I work every night because I'm trying to stay away from the gangs," Roger 
said to me as he pocketed a $10 purchase and tip from Los Angeles Lakers center 
Sam Bowie. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger says that when he recently took a few days off he got robbed and roughed 
up at a Chinese restaurant near his house. "That's what happens when I don't 
work. That's why I work every day. I leave early in the morning for school. 
When I get out of school, I go over to my friend's home and do my homework, and 
then I come here. I go home late at night. I don't like to go home before 11 or 
12, because they are still out there drinking and smoking before that. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing at home, so I stay out here."  
</P>
<P>
 "Anything I can. That's what I will do to stay alive."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; CITY WON'T BUY 80 ACRES ZONED FOR MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a closed meeting, the Simi Valley City Council decided not to buy 80 acres 
of hillside property that has been zoned to accommodate a long-planned a 
regional mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The council reached the decision this week after considering a proposal from 
three landowners offering to sell 80 acres of undeveloped land near the 
Radisson Hotel for an undisclosed amount. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Gary Seaton of Mitchell Realtors, representing the same 
landowners, offered to sell the city the land for about $8.8 million -- about 
the same square-foot price the city paid a month earlier for 32 acres nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 But City Manager Lin Koester rejected the offer, saying the city had achieved 
its goal of owning a key piece of mall land with the 32-acre purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-December the city officials agreed to pay $3.5 million for the 32-acre 
parcel, hoping they could use it to help lure a mall developer to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the city plan, a developer of the regional mall could lease or purchase 
the 80 acres that are up for sale. SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CITY WELCOME-SIGN PLANS TO BE REFINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They liked the colors, they liked the size and they liked the design. But 
Thousand Oaks council members could not agree on where to place new gateway 
monument signs welcoming motorists to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 And they could not decide exactly what the signs should say. 
</P>
<P>
 So, after approving the basic concept of a beige concrete sign adorned with a 
textured oak tree and mountain ridge, council members sent the proposal to the 
Planning Commission for further refining. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the Planning Commission's tasks: deciding whether the signs should 
welcome visitors to the city of Thousand Oaks or to its distinct neighborhoods, 
such as Newbury Park and Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Frank Schillo advocated tailoring the signs to each section of the 
city. "I don't think you can put up a Thousand Oaks sign (at the intersection 
of Borchard Road and Michael Drive) without a reference to Newbury Park," he 
said. "I don't think that would fly." 
</P>
<P>
 But Planning Director Phil Gatch argued that such distinctions would work 
against the signs' purpose. "I thought the idea was to make this a whole 
community, with continuity of signs," he said. "We do not need a more 
fragmented community." 
</P>
<P>
 Each gateway sign will weigh about two tons and will cost up to $5,000, 
including installation and soft lighting. The signs are designed for placement 
in median strips, not along freeways. STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; LINE OF QUARTERS TO BE GIVEN TO 
HOSPICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oaks mall, freshly spruced up with purple and green accents, will feature 
a shiny new decoration Saturday: a line of quarters placed side by side down 
the middle of the shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 Each quarter placed on the line of sticky tape will be donated to Hospice of 
the Conejo, a nonprofit organization providing support to terminally ill 
patients and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers hope to raise $7,500 in the Fill the Gap fund-raising campaign to 
cover a shortfall in the hospice's $145,000 annual budget. The group gets about 
14% of its budget from United Way and raises the rest through donations. 
</P>
<P>
 To attract pocket change in Saturday's quest for coins, organizers will offer 
prizes to donors who plunk down a quarter on predetermined, but secret 
locations along the line. Visitors to the Thousand Oaks mall will also get a 
chance to guess the length of the line and the number of quarters it will hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Donors need not bring their own change -- dozens of hospice volunteers will 
carry around $5,000 worth of quarters to swap for dollar bills or checks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never done anything like this before, and it's going to be fun," said 
Jean Heister, hospice volunteer coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Run mainly by volunteers, Hospice of the Conejo has served up to 80 families a 
year for 18 years. The group was honored with a Thousand Oaks City Council 
commendation this week. STEPHANIE SIMON

PASTOR SEEKS HELP IN RECOVERING STOLEN ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pastor asked for help Thursday in finding four African Christian prints 
stolen from his South-Central Los Angeles church.  
</P>
<P>
 The prints, valued at $2,250, turned up missing Wednesday afternoon from the 
Faith United Methodist Church, 1713 W. 108th St., the Rev. M. Andrew 
Robinson-Gaither said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stolen were prints of an African image of Jesus, Joy Smith's "Black Madonna 
and Child," Cornell Barnes' "Famous Faces" and a print titled "Crucifixion."  
</P>
<P>
 "The prints are very important to us, and we hope someone will call us or the 
Sheriff's Department if they know where they are," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The church "is one of the most profound Afrocentric congregations in Los 
Angeles," Robinson-Gaither said. "Several years ago . . . the congregation 
began dismantling all the Eurocentric religious images in its facilities, long 
before it was popular, and replacing them with African Christian art," he said.

CHILDREN'S PARADE TO OPEN CONEJO FESTIVITIES; THOUSAND OAKS: ORGANIZERS SAY THE 
EMPHASIS IS ON MAKING THE TWO-WEEK EVENT ACCESSIBLE TO FAMILIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Cowgirls in costumes, elaborate floats and country-Western dancing will mark 
the opening of the annual Conejo Valley Days festival at the traditional 
children's parade Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 About 300 children, all under the age of 14, are expected to march, ride 
horseback or walk next to floats as they make their way down Auto Mall Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Valley Days officials said the parade is an ideal event to open this 
year's carnival because of an effort to involve children in the events planned 
for the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our emphasis this year has been to make this event accessible to families," 
said Jennifer Cummings, organizer of Conejo Valley Days. "We want people to 
create an event that suits the entire family." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Conejo Valley Days officials said, the combination of a rowdy 
Western image and the perception that teen-agers dominate the fairgrounds has 
kept people away. 
</P>
<P>
 But festival organizers have vowed to push the 40-year-old event into a new 
era. 
</P>
<P>
 "This event has changed as the community has changed," said Pete Turpel, 
Conejo Valley Days general chairman. "It started as a tribute to this area's 
Western heritage, and it has grown to mirror the family environment that you 
find here today." 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings touts this year's event as the first to include a separate tent 
filled with crafts and games geared toward children. Yet the event still models 
itself after the original Conejo Valley Days from the 1940s and '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a history prepared by the Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce, the 
two-week extravaganza -- including the five-day carnival April 27 to May 1 -- 
is based on a community circus that was held in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 That included animal acts, music, dancing and the crowning of a circus queen. 
The circus has been replaced by a rodeo and other Western-theme events. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be having the rodeo and the chili cook-off and the Western wear just 
like other years," Cummings said, noting that the theme of this year's festival 
is "Boots, Buckles and Bandannas." 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want to make sure people feel comfortable coming out with their whole 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 To help accommodate the anticipated turnout of 60,000 to 70,000 people over 
the five-day carnival, festival officials were able to acquire three extra 
soccer fields at Conejo Creek Park, at the Moorpark Freeway and Janss Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Turpel said planners hope a high turnout will help bring renewed energy to the 
event and send additional funds into the community. Aside from a portion of the 
gate, the money raised at the event goes to local service groups and charities, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the event drew 40,000 people and turned a $20,000 profit. But two 
years ago, it lost more than $22,000, forcing the city of Thousand Oaks to lend 
festival organizers the money to pay for security and other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee is expected to repay the loan after this year's event. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're extremely optimistic that the turnout will be in record numbers this 
year," said Steve Rubenstein, president of the Conejo Valley Chamber of 
Commerce. "There's really a newfound interest in the event." 
</P>
<P>
 For the children planning to march Saturday, preparations are already under 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids are really looking forward to the parade and all of the activities 
this year," said Grace Hollow, who is helping prepare 13 neighborhood children 
to march as cowpokes this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all see this as a great time for Thousand Oaks," Hollow said. "The whole 
community comes together." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The children's parade will be held Saturday at the Westlake Automotive Center. 
Lineup for the parade begins at 9 a.m., and the parade begins at 10 a.m. Food 
and entertainment for children will be offered after the parade. Conejo Valley 
Days carnival will run from April 27 to May 1. For information, call 378-5596 
or 498-8585 to sign up children for the parade.

SHERIFF'S SUBSTATION IS PROPOSED IN MOORPARK; LAW ENFORCEMENT: COUNCILMAN IS 
CALLING FOR A DOWNTOWN SITE. CITY HAS THE LOWEST CRIME RATE IN COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Although Moorpark is the safest city in one of the safest counties in the 
country, City Councilman Pat Hunter says it needs a bigger police presence. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter is proposing that Moorpark spend about $30,000 to locate a Ventura 
County Sheriff's Department substation downtown in a bank building at High 
Street and Moorpark Avenue that has been abandoned since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not only important that people are safe, but that they feel safe," said 
Hunter, a deputy for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. "It's good 
for business and the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter is also calling for more funds from county coffers to cover the cost of 
increasing sheriff's patrols in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In a strongly worded letter to Supervisor Vicky Howard, Hunter said the 
county's decision to allocate the lion's share of Proposition 172 money to 
operate the new county jail near Santa Paula offered no benefit to Moorpark 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the county's 10 cities already had banned together to lobby for an 
increased share in the estimated $26 million in money from Proposition 172, 
approved by the county's voters last November. 
</P>
<P>
 "When voters in Moorpark voted on 172 they did so with the understanding that 
with the new tax they would see a very direct benefit, including enhanced 
patrols," Hunter said in an interview. "As it is, the county is actually 
raising the cost we must pay for our existing service. So if we don't want to 
see a reduction in the number of patrols we'll have to pay more." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter said money for law enforcement should be allocated on a per capita 
basis, leaving cities the opportunity to set their own priorities for policing. 
</P>
<P>
 "People here are very concerned about the amount of commercial trucking coming 
through the town," Hunter said. Patrols to crack down on truckers who violate 
local traffic laws might be more appropriate in Moorpark than targeting violent 
crime, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we want to spend money on that we should be able to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Sgt. Keith Parks, who helps manage the Sheriff's Department's 
20-member force in Moorpark, said beefing up patrols and staffing a substation 
would do more for the community's peace of mind than it would toward reducing 
the already low crime rate. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, there were about 19.2 serious crimes per 1,000 residents in Moorpark, 
compared to a countywide average of 38.3 crimes per 1,000 residents, Sheriff's 
Department statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I understand it, the substation is really not being designed to 
reduce crime," Parks said. "It's to provide a place for one-on-one contact with 
the community. This is not like Oxnard or Ventura locating storefronts in 
high-crime zones." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Hunter said the goal will always be to reduce crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason we have the lowest crime rate in the county is that we've made 
crime prevention a priority," he said. "The level of public safety is directly 
related to the number of police on the street. If that's how the people here 
want to spend their money, we should be allowed to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter has the support of downtown merchants and business leaders who see a 
downtown substation and more patrols as a way to enhance Moorpark's image as a 
safe place to work and shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great idea," said Francis Okyere, a local businessman and former 
president of the Chamber of Commerce. "It's not a high-crime area, but better 
to act now than to wait until crime becomes a problem. If you wait until the 
crime rate jumps, more patrols will be too late, and it will become a much more 
costly problem to correct."

POLITICAL BRIEFING: HERO'S WELCOME GREETS ROBERTI ON HIS RETURN TO THE STATE 
SENATE

 BACK FROM THE TRENCHES: Fresh from his recall victory, state Sen. David A. 
Roberti got a hero's welcome home when he returned Thursday to the ornate 
chambers of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Several fellow senators rushed over to warmly shake Roberti's hand or 
affectionately slap his back even before the Van Nuys Democrat could get 
settled in his seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the speeches started. First it was Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), then 
Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), then Sen. Nicholas C. Petris 
(D-Oakland), then Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles), then Sen. Tom Hayden 
(D-Santa Monica). 
</P>
<P>
 In between came the standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the string of Democrats was finished lauding Roberti, he was a 
courageous liberator of all senators who dare to stand up to a "threatening, 
dangerous . . . maniacal enemy." 
</P>
<P>
 That last characterization of Roberti's foes, voiced by Watson, was enough to 
push Sen. Don Rogers (R-Tehachapi) over the edge. He hadn't wanted to rain on 
Roberti's parade, he told the Senate, but enough was enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's remember that a lot of the people who voted for this recall are decent 
Californians who want to preserve their rights to have firearms to defend 
themselves," Rogers protested. "I think it's a God-given right." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti took Rogers' remarks in stride, thanked his Democratic colleagues for 
their congratulations, and took the opportunity to call for more controls on 
recall elections. 
</P>
<P>
 He urged the Senate to work toward laws requiring recall elections to be held 
on the same day as regularly scheduled elections, a move that would save 
taxpayers and candidates money. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti also noted in an interview afterward that he thought it might be a 
good idea to develop regulations to ensure truthfulness in the 
signature-gathering process. "I think the proof is in the pudding," he said. 
"They (his opponents) got more signatures than they did votes," he said. 
</P>

 INDEPENDENT STREAK: An active group of former supporters of Ross Perot in the 
24th congressional district has found a candidate to back as an independent in 
the fall campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks chapter of United We Stand American has decided to throw its 
support behind political newcomer Rhett Wooden, a Thousand Oaks film cameraman 
and grip, in a district represented by veteran Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson 
(D-Woodland Hills). The group must collect at least 10,000 signatures this 
summer to get Wooden on the ballot for the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is an independent," said Verne Balman, a leader of the group. "Rhett is a 
believer in representative government in true fashion. He believes in finding 
out what the people of the district believe and going and representing that, 
irrespective of his own beliefs." 
</P>
<P>
 Wooden, 43, previously registered as a Democratic and a Republican and is now 
an independent. A self-described centrist, he was active in Perot's 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody's got to do it," Wooden said Thursday. "What I tell people most 
often is that they keep looking for hope from the Democratic and Republican 
parties and how can they get hope from something that is the problem? So new 
leadership has to come from outside." 
</P>
<P>
 Wooden and his backers face numerous hurdles. They have raised little money. 
And other United We Stand chapters in the San Fernando Valley -- which makes up 
three-quarters of the district -- declined to join the effort to field an 
independent. 
</P>
<P>
 The organizers of the other chapters are divided between supporting Republican 
primary candidates Richard Sybert, a Woodland Hills attorney and former aide to 
Gov. Pete Wilson, and Robert Hammer, a Newbury Park investment banker. 
</P>
<P>
 The United We Stand chapters are planning to host a candidates' forum on May 5 
at Parkman Junior High School in Woodland Hills.

 BANKING ON HUFFINGTON: Putting pragmatism over philosophical differences on 
hot-button social issues, Rep. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita) has 
endorsed fellow freshman Rep. Michael Huffington (R-Santa Barbara) in the 
Republican U.S. Senate primary this June. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon acknowledged that his conservative views are closer to former Orange 
County Rep. William E. Dannemeyer on abortion and gay rights but he said that 
the more moderate, well-heeled Huffington would have a better chance to oust 
Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's in a neighboring district," McKeon said of the man who spent millions to 
best Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura) in 1992 and is expected to spend 
generously on his Senate campaign as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worked together. I think he's a good man. . . . He very much wants change, 
very much wants to see new people involved and very much wants to cut spending. 
And I agree with him on all of those things." 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon said that he wants to avoid a repeat of the 1992 Senate race when 
conservative commentator Bruce Herschensohn edged moderate Republican Rep. Tom 
Campbell in the GOP primary only to lose to liberal Democrat Barbara Boxer in 
the general election. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would rather have a Republican in there who would vote with me 70% or 80% 
of the time than a Democrat who would with me 5% or 10%," McKeon said. 
</P>

 RINGING UP THE NUMBERS: Valley area Reps. Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale) and 
Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) are cited in a new report on political 
contributions made by the so-called Baby Bells and long distance telephone 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Common Cause, a proponent of campaign finance reform, analyzed campaign 
contributions by the telephone firms in a report called "Dialing for Dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 The Baby Bells contributed $9.4 million between 1984 and 1993; the 
long-distance companies, $7.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The two interests are locked in a high-stakes battle over bills that would 
allow the Baby Bells to compete for and provide long distance services and 
enter the telecommunications equipment market. The long distance companies 
oppose the measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Common Cause found the telecommunication PACs were partial to members of the 
House Energy and Commerce and Judiciary committees -- the two panels that 
oversee telephone-related issues. Moorhead, the senior Republican on the Energy 
and Commerce Committee and a longtime Judiciary Committee member, received 
$27,090 from the Baby Bells and $16,750 from the long distance companies. 
Waxman, who chairs Energy and Commerce's subcommittee on health and 
environment, took in $24,750 from the Baby Bells and $17,000 from long distance 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consumers could be the ultimate losers in this turf war -- consumers whose 
voices are put 'on hold' by a campaign finance system that allows millions of 
dollars to be used to gain influence over telecommunications policy" said 
Common Cause President Fred Wertheimer. 
</P>
<P>
 Some lawmakers contend that the opposing sides tend to offset each other with 
such contributions. And Moorhead said that Wertheimer is off-base, at least in 
his case. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not an especially high amount over a 10-year period, especially when 
you consider that (telecommunications interests) haven't really had a lot of 
major legislation that's been considered until just recently," the veteran 
lawmaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for granting contributors special access, he said, "Everyone has access to 
my office. No one gets turned away. I'm about as easy to get ahold of as 
anybody in the Capitol."

ORGANIZERS HOPE OFFER IS MUSIC TO EARS OF CONCERT-GOERS; THOUSAND OAKS: 
VOLUNTEERS WANT TO FORM NONPROFIT GROUP, SELL $50 TICKETS FOR SERIES AT NEW 
CIVIC ARTS PLAZA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 With the opening this fall of the new Civic Arts Plaza in Thousand Oaks, a 
longtime tradition of bargain-priced concerts -- from classical to bluegrass to 
Broadway -- may be revived in the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Small groups of volunteers in Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks are now working 
together to establish a nonprofit association that would draw an eclectic mix 
of professional performers to the new 1,800-seat Civic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 The group plans to sell season tickets to a series of four concerts under the 
banner "Live From the Plaza." Although tickets to single performances would not 
be available, organizers are hoping the $50 price for the 1995-96 season will 
be viewed as a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an opportunity for more people and for families to be able to afford to 
see professional concerts at a reasonable price," said Dolores Didio, who is 
helping to organize the new group. 
</P>
<P>
 About 70 such organizations exist in California, all of which are overseen by 
Community Concerts, a New York-based talent booking agency founded 67 years 
ago. Although many of the independent associations are thriving, others have 
seen their memberships decline over the last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous Thousand Oaks association folded in 1988 because of low 
attendance, a lack of volunteers and difficulties in scheduling performances at 
Cal Lutheran University. That group was founded in 1961, when there were few 
other cultural offerings in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that time, it was actually easier for them to get memberships because 
there was nothing else," Didio said. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett Ascher, executive director of the Conejo Symphony Orchestra, which 
also brings guest performers to the area, said he was not worried about losing 
potential patrons to the concert series. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope they can do it. It's wonderful," he said. "You never know until you 
try." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the new Conejo Valley association said the next few months will 
be crucial in determining their success. They hope to sell enough season 
tickets by November to cover the $10,000 it would cost to put on four concerts 
during the 1995-96 season. Performances are booked a year in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 "In community concerts we have to have our money up front," said Carol Bowen, 
a past president of the disbanded Thousand Oaks group. "We have to get the 
appropriate artists within our budgets." 
</P>
<P>
 The $50 adult subscription price for the four-concert series compares with $25 
to $30 admission fees for other individual performances booked at the Civic 
Arts Plaza. Ticket prices for students, seniors and families have not yet been 
set. 
</P>
<P>
 If the membership drive is successful, it would encompass the 500-member Simi 
Valley Community Concerts Assn. Inc., which was forced to look for alternative 
venues after Simi Valley High School suffered earthquake damage. The group now 
plans to hold three concerts during the 1994-95 season at Royal High School, 
with the fourth booked at the Civic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to advertising for members in Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley, the 
new combined association would also serve patrons of a Van Nuys group that is 
now struggling with low membership and waning interest. Chartered buses may be 
offered to carry Simi Valley and Van Nuys members to the concerts in Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Mitze, executive director of the Civic Auditorium and Forum Theater, said 
the appeal of the new arts center may help the new association overcome the 
difficulties that led to the demise of the former Thousand Oaks group. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they need and haven't had to date is a first-class concert hall," he 
said. "A gym is great for basketball, but not for concerts." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitze said he believes the price of the concert series will be the main appeal 
to potential members. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the best bargains you can get if you're a concert lover," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 By moving to the Civic Auditorium, the association's supporters are also 
hoping to draw in more, younger patrons. Senior citizens have traditionally 
made up a large portion of the membership in community concert associations. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen said the effort to establish a new association was spurred, in part, by 
the results from 850 questionnaires sent to Conejo Valley residents in recent 
weeks. So far, about 150 have been returned, indicating support for a concert 
series, with about 40 people expressing an interest in helping with fund 
raising, she said.

GUSTING WINDS DON'T STOP ESTES FROM SHARE OF FIRST-ROUND LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fred Funk and Bob Estes battled differing conditions to the same result, 
sharing the lead Thursday in the opening round of the Heritage Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Funk took advantage of a tame Harbour Town layout devoid of its menacing 
winds.Estes played through more gusty conditions in the afternoon. Both were at 
six-under 65, one stroke in front of Masters runner-up Tom Lehman and Barry 
Jaeckel. 
</P>
<P>
 Favorite Greg Norman led a group of six at 67 in the $1.25-million event. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight of the top 11 teed off before noon, when soft greens and sunny skies had 
players zoning in on the pins. The greens dried out by afternoon and shots that 
landed nicely for birdie tries earlier were skidding off the greens. Only nine 
of the 32 golfers who shot sub-70 rounds began in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Funk birdied the 16th and 17th holes, two of Harbour Town's closing trio 
exposed to the unpredictable winds of Calibogue Sound. He said he was fortunate 
to get out before conditions changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you get some momentum here, you can really take advantage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Estes had four of his seven birdies on the back nine, when the wind picked up 
considerably. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any wind on this golf course makes you guess a little bit, especially when 
it's swirling around the greens," he said.

GOLF / PGA SENIORS' CHAMPIONSHIP; DENT HAS FEW NICKS IN HIS ROUND OF 66 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe it was because he needed the money, but Jim Dent played his best round 
of the year Thursday and had a two-stroke lead after the first round of the PGA 
Seniors' Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-hitting Dent shot a 66, six under par, on the 6,702-yard Champion 
course -- second longest on the Senior PGA Tour -- at PGA National Resort. 
Larry Ziegler, who often starts fast, and Jim Colbert were at 68. Most of the 
low scores were posted early, before the wind kicked up. Colbert, however, was 
one of the last to tee off and had a 33 on the tougher back nine. 
</P>
<P>
 Dent acknowledged being one of the senior golfers fined this week by 
Commissioner Deane Beman for purse-splitting. He said he didn't know how many 
violations he had, but it will cost him $2,000 per violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Charles, like Dent an early starter, headed a trio at 69. He played well 
after starting with bogeys on the first two holes, two of the easiest. 
</P>
<P>
 Another happy late starter was Raymond Floyd, also at 69, along with Bob 
Murphy, who birdied the first four holes. Floyd missed four putts of less than 
10 feet on the front nine but said he was extremely pleased. Floyd is in good 
position to make it two consecutive victories in senior majors. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Trevino was among six at 70. Others in that group included Walt Zembriski, 
Dale Douglass and Dave Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think the wind was too bad, but the crosswind got me at 15 when I 
went over the green in the water," Trevino said. "But I like my chances. I hit 
the ball today as well as I have in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Dent, who has been struggling this year, said he had met with a couple of old 
friends, Jimmy Ballard and Rick Bradshaw, who helped straighten out both his 
swing and his attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last couple of years here, I was drowning the ball on the par threes," 
Dent said. "Sometimes I've had sevens and sixes, but today I avoided the water 
and played them one under." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Jack Nicklaus revamped the course three years ago, water can be a 
problem on as many as 13 of the 18 holes. 
</P>
<P>
 The water disrupted Nicklaus on 15 and 17, both par threes. Nicklaus was three 
under going to 15, but put a six-iron shot in the water and did the same on 17. 
Each time he saved a bogey. He finished at 71, one under par and five shots 
behind Dent. 
</P>
<P>
 Dent didn't win a tournament last year, finishing second in the Ralphs at 
Rancho Park and the Tournament of Champions at La Costa. He says his change in 
attitude could change that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really feel pretty good about today's round," he said. "I think the last 
five holes are as tough a finishing group as we play. The two par threes are 
164 and 152, but if the wind's blowing you can really get into trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Ziegler led last year after the first round with a 66. The year before he had 
an opening 69. In his other six rounds those two years, he never shot better 
than 74. 
</P>
<P>
 A difference is that Ziegler, because of torn cartilage in his sternum, had 
not played for five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't hurt," he said. "But because I had not played, I didn't expect 
anything. I started hitting balls last Friday and used the woods Monday. I had 
been pretty wild for a couple of days, so I was pleasantly surprised. Maybe the 
solution is to stay relaxed and not expect too much." 
</P>
<P>
 The wind was probably responsible for some unusual rounds. Murphy birdied the 
first four holes, then bogeyed the first three on the back nine. Charles, known 
for his steady play, had one par, five birdies and three bogeys on the front 
nine. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion Tom Wargo shot a 72. Mike Hill, suffering back problems, 
double-bogeyed the last two holes, shot 78 and might have to withdraw. Arnold 
Palmer shot a 77.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; NEW MET LINTON GETS TWO GIFTS IN VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First Doug Linton was presented with a 1993 World Series ring by the Toronto 
Blue Jays, for whom he pitched in four games last season before being claimed 
on waivers by the Angels on June 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he was presented with a 10-9 victory over the Chicago Cubs by the Mets, 
his new team. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole day was a roller-coaster ride in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mets had an 8-3 lead, which was wiped out by Chicago's six-run eighth 
inning that featured home runs by Sammy Sosa and Steve Buchele. 
</P>
<P>
 New York won it in the bottom of the inning on a two-run homer by Jeff Kent, 
his second of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hit a mistake pitch," Kent said. "(Dan) Plesac threw a fastball down the 
middle and all I had to do was put the bat on the ball. I could see it in his 
face that he wanted the pitch back." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago reliever disagreed. "He had a good swing at every pitch I threw 
him," Plesac (1-1) said. "I wouldn't take it back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to keep it down and make him hit it in the middle of the field. He 
did. The only problem was that it went over 400 feet in the middle of the 
field." 
</P>
<P>
 Linton (1-0) was the fourth Met pitcher, getting the final two outs of the 
eighth inning on fly balls and turning the game over to John Franco, who got 
the save. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 6, San Francisco 1 -- Greg Maddux pitched a three-hitter at Atlanta as 
the Braves won for the ninth time in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie catcher Javier Lopez supplied most of the offense with two home runs 
and four RBIs for Maddux (3-0), who struck out nine. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 5, Philadelphia 0 -- David Nied allowed only two hits in seven 
innings and Dante Bichette hit his sixth homer at Philadelphia as the Rockies 
got the first shutout victory in their two-season history. 
</P>
<P>
 Nied (2-0) struck out four. Bruce Ruffin pitched the eighth inning and Darren 
Holmes the ninth for the Rockies, who were playing their 170th game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Phillies' Curt Schilling (0-2) had a one-hit shutout going with one out in 
the seventh inning before Bichette homered. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 8, Houston 2 -- Benito Santiago lined a three-run double and Kurt 
Abbott followed with a homer as the Marlins scored six runs in the first inning 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The feast-or-famine Marlins have scored 32 runs in four victories and nine 
runs in five defeats. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 4, San Diego 2 -- Dave Clark put the Pirates ahead with a pinch-hit 
triple and Andy Van Slyke preserved the lead with a highlight-film catch in the 
eighth inning as they finished a three-game sweep of the Padres at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 The Padres lost their fifth in a row. San Diego's 1-9 record is the worst in 
the majors.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; A'S ECKERSLEY GETS F'S IN GAMES AGAINST TWINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's getting to be habit-forming, and Dennis Eckersley wants to break the 
habit. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Twins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been snake bit by this team," Eckersley said Thursday after blowing a 
three-run, ninth-inning lead in the Athletics' 5-4 loss at Oakland. "That's 
baseball. I couldn't stop the bleeding again, just like I did last week." 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday at Minneapolis, Eckersley (0-1) failed to hold an 8-4 lead in a 
game the A's went on to win, 10-9. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Oakland led, 4-1, when Dave Winfield reached on an error by second 
baseman Junior Noboa. Scott Leius struck out and Rich Becker grounded out as 
Winfield took second. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Walbeck singled in a run, pinch-hitter Chip Hale singled and Alex Cole's 
double made it 4-3. Chuck Knoblauch then singled in the tying and go-ahead 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota Manager Tom Kelly said Eckersley's performance was atypical. 
</P>
<P>
 "A whole bunch of us would like to have Eckersley on our staff," Kelly said. 
"We'd be lined up to get him." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Trombley (1-0) pitched 1 1/3 innings to win, and Rick Aguilera got three 
outs for his third save. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 10, Chicago 3 -- Paul O'Neill hit two homers and drove in five runs 
for the Yankees at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill also had a double as New York ended its four-game losing streak while 
stopping the White Sox's four-game winning streak by roughing up 1993 AL Cy 
Young winner Jack McDowell (1-2) with four runs in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Key (2-1) improved to 18-7 against the White Sox. He gave up seven hits, 
including homers to Frank Thomas and Darrin Jackson, in 6 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 3, Detroit 1 -- Mike Mussina increased his lifetime record against 
the Tigers to 5-0, getting a home run from Brady Anderson as support at 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Mussina (3-0) gave up one run and four hits in 7 2/3 innings, striking out 
seven. He has a 1.64 ERA in eight starts against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Mills struck out Eric Davis with the bases loaded in the eighth inning, 
and Lee Smith pitched a perfect ninth for his fourth save. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore won two of three in Detroit, its first series victory at Tiger 
Stadium in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 7, Texas 2 -- John Jaha drove in four runs and Ricky Bones (2-0) 
pitched a five-hitter in beating the Rangers at Arlington, Tex. Kevin Brown 
(0-3) gave up five runs in the first inning and two in the second.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; RODGERS: BASEBALLS HAVE BEEN ALTERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel Manager Buck Rodgers is convinced that the baseballs are juiced this 
season and predicts this will turn out like the 1987 season in which the home 
run totals were greatly inflated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew from the first day of spring training that the balls were juiced," 
Rodgers said. "When you see opposite-field homers from people who don't hit 
opposite-field homers, that's when you know something's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Are baseball owners behind this to increase interest? 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't think someone in Haiti or Costa Rica just decided to turn up the 
crank, do you?" Rodgers said. "Someone has to tell them. The buck has to stop 
some place. How far up the ladder, I don't know.

 "It makes it more exciting for fans, but they're still paying for guys from 
'87. There were guys who got three- or four-year contracts just from that year; 
the Dodgers have got one (Tim Wallach) playing third base right now."

 Starter Frank Tanana, considered one of the finest pitchers in Angel history, 
has retired from baseball, his agent, Tony Attanasio, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanana, who was released March 20 from the Angels, quit working out two weeks 
ago and has abandoned plans to return for a 22nd season in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's retired," Attanasio said. "His specific instructions to me were not to 
call anybody. If somebody called, fine. If not, so be it. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one called, so he's retired." 
</P>
<P>
 Tanana, 40, was 0-3 with a 13.50 ERA this spring before the Angels decided he 
didn't fit in their plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanana, who ranks among the Angel career leaders in six categories, retires 
with a career 240-236 record.

 Starter Mark Langston, who underwent arthroscopic surgery Tuesday to remove 
three bone chips in his left elbow, began his rehabilitative therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to try to be as aggressive as I can with it," Langston said. "I 
don't even know if I'm supposed to flex it, but I haven't had any pain at all. 
I was prepared for the worst and have been very pleasantly surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows, maybe it will add three to four miles per hour to my fastball. 
That would be nice."

THOROUGHBRED RACING / BILL CHRISTINE; KANDALY COULD PROVIDE A RACY END TO THIS 
EQUINE SOAP OPERA

 In the few years since Risen Star almost swept the Triple Crown in 1988, the 
lives of Louie Roussel III and Ronnie LaMarque have played like a pot-boiling 
novel: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Roussel, co-owner and trainer of Risen Star, who had a tough-luck 
third-place finish in the Kentucky Derby before winning the Preakness and 
Belmont Stakes, broke up with his long-time companion, Vickie Bayley, who later 
had a romance with Roger Clinton, the president's half-brother, before Clinton 
married someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Michelle Armstrong, the brave young girl from Klamath Falls, Ore., who 
rooted for Risen Star and accepted the colt's Eclipse Award on behalf of 
Roussel and LaMarque at the Century Plaza Hotel in Century City in 1989, died 
after a long battle with leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Roussel and his father sold their racetrack, the Fair Grounds in New 
Orleans, for $25 million in 1990. A seven-alarm fire destroyed the track's 
ancient grandstand and most of the clubhouse on Dec. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 -- LaMarque, a New Orleans automobile dealer who also owned Risen Star and was 
the Triple Crown troubadour in 1988, serenading the colt from track to track, 
ended a 21-year marriage this week. Carmela LaMarque, his former wife, was 
given a suspended eight-year sentence last month after having been found guilty 
of conspiring with relatives to kill her estranged husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have forgiven, but I won't be forgetting," LaMarque said Thursday. "This 
has been a tough year." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On Dec. 17, a few hours before fire swept through the Fair Grounds, an 
unraced 2-year-old named Kandaly ran in a maiden race there. He won by 2 1/2 
lengths, starting a four-race career, and will race in Saturday's $500,000 Blue 
Grass Stakes at Keeneland. Roussel and LaMarque, the trainer and the 
troubadour, now own 50% of Kandaly and appear headed for another Kentucky 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 "Star was a champion," Roussel said. "This one is just hoping to be as good. 
But he comes from downtown (far behind), and I like that in a horse. Because I 
think he can get a mile and a quarter, his ticket's already punched for the 
Derby, no matter what he does in this race. Kandaly's a son of Alydar, who 
sired Alysheba and Strike The Gold to win the Derby. There's never a two 
without a three, is there?" 
</P>
<P>
 Roussel, a 48-year-old law school graduate who left banking and insurance to 
train horses full time a couple of years before Risen Star came along, is a 
prisoner of superstition, with a little predestination thrown in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that God is particular about who he gives great horses to," he said 
at his Keeneland barn, wearing some of the same clothes -- a cap and jacket -- 
that stayed with him throughout 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 At Thursday's post-position draw, Kandaly's breeder and 50% owner, New York 
literary agent Rosalind Cole, was looking for Roussel, but LaMarque told her 
that he would be a no-show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Louie believes that going to draws jinxes a horse," LaMarque said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kandaly drew the No. 3 post among seven horses in the 1 1/8-mile Blue Grass 
and was listed as the 5-1 third choice. Holy Bull, winner of the Florida Derby 
and beaten only once in seven starts, is the 4-5 favorite, followed by Valiant 
Nature, winner of December's Hollywood Futurity, at 9-5. Here's the way they'll 
line up in the gate, with jockeys and odds: 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull, Mike Smith, 4-5; Warn Me, James Bruin, 30-1; Kandaly, Craig Perret, 
5-1; Bonus Money, Earlie Fires, 20-1; Mahogany Hall, Willie Martinez, 20-1; 
Valiant Nature, Laffit Pincay, 8-5; Chimes Band, Shane Sellers, 10-1. All 
horses will carry 121 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 In late February, three weeks before the Louisiana Derby, Roussel and LaMarque 
became Cole's partners, paying what is believed to be in the low six figures 
for their 50% interest. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, in Kandaly's first race as a 3-year-old and his first appearance 
since his maiden victory, the colt rallied from 15 lengths back and finished 
second, a length behind the Roussel-trained Star Campaigner at the Fair 
Grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Kandaly ran one more time for his original trainer, Niall O'Callaghan, winning 
another Fair Grounds allowance, before he was saddled by Roussel and made up 12 
lengths to beat Game Coin by 1 1/2 lengths in the Louisiana Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 LaMarque, also 48, has composed a song in honor of Kandaly (can-DOLLY), just 
as he did for Risen Star in 1988. The Risen Star song, which LaMarque once sang 
on national television, borrowed music from "When You Wish Upon a Star," "Way 
Down Yonder in New Orleans" and "New York, New York," depending on LaMarque's 
mood. 
</P>
<P>
 LaMarque sang in a Baltimore crab restaurant the night that Risen Star won the 
Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing about Ronnie's singing is that he's brave," said Joe Hirsch of the 
Daily Racing Form. "Some people at the next table threw rolls at him, and they 
were even buttered rolls." 
</P>
<P>
 LaMarque's song for Kandaly is sung to the tune of the old Manfred Mann hit, 
"Doo Wah Diddy Diddy." LaMarque handed a copy of the lyrics to Rosalind Cole on 
Thursday and they attempted a duet: 
</P>
<P>
 Here he comes just runnin' down the stretch We're singing , Go Kandaly , Go 
Kandaly , go . Listening to those hoofbeats clickerty clackin' on the track 
We're singing , Go Kandaly , Go Kandaly , go Runs fast , runs fast Looks fine , 
looks fine Runs fast, looks fine, Derby bells are gonna chime . The morning 
line might be 5-1 on Kandaly, but LaMarque is looking at different odds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's 1-9 that I'll sing Saturday," he said. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Kandaly is not expected to run if there's an off track, but Saturday's Blue 
Grass weather looks favorable: Partly cloudy with little or no chance of rain, 
and temperatures in the high 50s. . . . Other important Kentucky Derby preps 
Saturday are the $500,000 Wood Memorial at Aqueduct and the $200,000 California 
Derby at Golden Gate Fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Go For Gin, who will be coupled with Crary in the Wood, is the 7-5 favorite, 
with Irgun at 8-5. Others running are Our Emblem, Presently, Bay Street Star, 
Shiprock, Jesse F and Code Home. . . . Dramatic Gold is the 8-5 favorite at 
Golden Gate, where Silver Music, Gracious Ghost, Double Jab, College Town, Bai 
Brun and Screaming Don are also entered. 
</P>
<P>
 In the $750,000 Oaklawn Handicap for older horses Saturday in Arkansas, The 
Wicked North is the 9-5 favorite. That field, in post-position order: Far Out 
Wadleigh, Glowing Crown, Myrakalu, Wallenda, The Wicked North, 
Eequalsmcsquared, Valley Crossing, Pistols And Roses, Hill Pass, Kissin Kris, 
Devil His Due, and Brother Brown.

LOS ALAMITOS; TOWN POLICY HIGHLIGHTS START OF 142-NIGHT STAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODY BERGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An abundance of horses for the stakes race and a dearth of entries for the 
others mark the opening quarter horse card at Los Alamitos, which begins its 
142-night stand tonight. Racing Thursday through Sunday, the track will offer 
nine to 14 races each night through Dec. 17.First post is 7:15 on weekdays and 
6:45 on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 A few appaloosa, Arabian and 4 1/2-furlong thoroughbred races will round out 
the mainly quarter horse cards.  
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's feature, the Town Policy Handicap, was originally scheduled as a 
$20,000 race for 3-year-olds at 350 yards. With 17 entries at Tuesday's draw, 
the Grade III race was split into two divisions, each worth $15,000.  
</P>
<P>
 The five other quarter horse events were not as easy to fill, and the draw 
stretched another day, closing Wednesday with six- and seven-horse fields 
dotting the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The horse shortage, common throughout horse racing, is usually most severe at 
the beginning of the Los Alamitos meet, then eases within a month. Because 
quarter horses last raced in Southern California in December, many horses have 
left to run in New Mexico and Oklahoma but will return to Los Alamitos later. 
</P>
<P>
 Some trainers moved their operations to a new track in Houston, which offers a 
shorter and unproven meet, but comparable purses and lower training costs. And 
still other horses remain in the area but are not ready to run.

NHL ROUNDUP; PANTHERS GET CONSOLATION PRIZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a case of too little, too late, and maybe that's why the Florida Panthers 
spent much of Thursday night at Miami in fights in a game that was virtually 
meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
 Jody Hull scored two goals and John Vanbiesbrouck broke out of a slump with 33 
saves in the Panthers' 4-1 victory over the New York Islanders, the team that 
edged Florida out of the NHL playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Tying the Mighty Ducks for the most victories, 33, and setting a record for 
most points, 83, by an expansion team was little recompense. The Panthers had 
hoped the final game of the regular season would be a showdown for the eighth 
and final playoff position in the Eastern Conference, but the Islanders foiled 
that plan Wednesday night by beating Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been in a small period of mourning," said Scott Mellanby, who scored 
the Panthers' first goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks ago, the Panthers seemed almost assured of a playoff spot but won 
only one of their last nine games (1-4-4) and squandered a six-point advantage. 
The Islanders got into the playoffs by closing with five victories and three 
ties in the last nine games and will face the New York Rangers in the first 
round of the playoffs beginning Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida swept the five-game series with the Islanders but finished a point 
behind New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Tampa Bay 5, Quebec 2 -- Petr Klima and John Tucker each scored twice and 
Daren Puppa made 31 saves as the Lightning won at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartford 3, Boston 2 -- Jocelyn Lemieux scored twice for the Whalers and the 
Bruins lost at Boston but still got what they wanted: home ice in their 
first-round playoff series against the Montreal Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston clinched fourth place in the Eastern Conference when Buffalo lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 3, Buffalo 2 -- Steve Konowalchuk, Kevin Hatcher and Dimitri 
Kristich scored first-period goals for the Capitals in their victory at 
Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 4, Ottawa 1 -- Tom Chorske scored twice in a 33-second span in the 
second period as the playoff-bound Devils capped their best regular season at 
East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelpia 2, New York Rangers 2 -- Dominic Roussel made 51 saves for the 
Flyers at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers, tuning up for their first-round game Sunday with the Islanders, 
went with their regulars and outshot the Flyers, 53-29. But they didn't have 
much luck against Roussel, who stopped breakaways by Mark Messier and Glenn 
Anderson and turned in a spectacular goaltending performance. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 3, Winnipeg 1 -- Brendan Shanahan finished the regular season with 
two more goals as the Blues beat the Jets at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blues were 1-2-1 in their last four games. Shanahan, who had three goals 
in a loss at Dallas on Tuesday, scored 12 goals in the last 10 games to finish 
with a career-high 52, one more than last season, and 102 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 6, Chicago 4 -- John Cullen and Wendel Clark scored two goals each as 
the Maple Leafs spoiled the Blackhawks' celebration of the last regular-season 
game at 65-year-old Chicago Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The two teams play each other in the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas 4, Detroit 3 -- Alan May scored the decisive goal in the third period 
at Dallas as the Stars finished the regular season with a franchise record 97 
points in their first season since moving from Minnesota. First Impressions 
</P>
<P>
 The Florida Panthers tied the record for victories and set the record for 
points by an expansion team in its first season. A look at the all-time

MANUFACTURING DEAL BETWEEN IBM, CYRIX MAY PUT A CHIP IN INTEL'S GRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Intensifying the microprocessor industry's assault on giant Intel Corp., IBM 
agreed Thursday to produce leading-edge computer chips designed by a small 
Texas company that has struggled for years to put a dent in Intel's dominance. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said IBM's deal with Cyrix Corp. of Richardson, Tex., could enable 
the companies to snag a significant share of the market for hot new 
microprocessors, which serve as the brains of personal computers. They added 
that consumers stand to benefit if the stepped-up rivalry with Intel continues 
to drive down prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the five-year contract, IBM will manufacture Cyrix-designed chips that 
are lower-cost versions of Intel's popular 486 microprocessors. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Cyrix will use IBM technology in its M1, an advanced chip yet to 
hit the market, and successive versions. The M1, which Cyrix said is due out by 
year's end, is expected to equal or surpass the speed of Intel's Pentium, the 
latest generation in the x86 family, but sell for much less. 
</P>
<P>
 Among investment analysts giving Cyrix shares a boost after the announcement 
was Michael A. Gumport, a senior vice president at Lehman Bros. in New York. 
Although he expects Intel to do "extremely well" during the next year, he said 
the IBM-Cyrix alliance will undoubtedly take business from the Santa Clara, 
Calif., company. Industry reports put Intel's share of the microprocessor 
market at 75% to 80%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like companies long-term who are gaining share, not losing it," Gumport 
wrote in a report Thursday. Gumport projected that Cyrix's 1994 earnings per 
share will amount to $1.30, or 5 cents ahead of his previous forecast. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, its first year as a public company, Cyrix reported earnings of about 
$20 million, or $1.06 per share, on sales of $125 million. By contrast, Intel 
made $2.3 billion on sales of $8.78 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In Nasdaq trading Thursday, Cyrix shares jumped $2.688 to close at $29.188. 
Intel tumbled $3.875 a share to $59.875. On the New York Stock Exchange, IBM 
gained $1.50 to $53.875. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cyrix has more to gain from the alliance, IBM profits by making use 
of idle factory space. In a statement, IBM acknowledged something widely 
suspected: that it has been making Cyrix's 486 microprocessors since September. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to supplying chips to Cyrix, which has no factories of its own, 
IBM also now has the right to make an equal number for its own use or for 
selling to other computer manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal follows IBM's decision in January not to manufacture Pentium chips 
for Intel. Under a 13-year agreement with Intel, IBM had been making x86 chips 
but had been constrained from selling them on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, the x86 represents an immediate market opportunity," said Ron 
Soicher, an IBM Microelectronics marketing executive. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Intel spokesman Howard High noted Thursday that "it's not automatic" 
that IBM's personal computer manufacturing company, for example, will buy 
IBM-made microprocessors. Intel is the chief supplier of microprocessors for 
IBM PCs. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel has been hit from several sides lately. It faces potentially stiff 
competition from the PowerPC, a speedy chip developed by Apple Computer, IBM 
and Motorola. Last month, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. won a pivotal victory 
against Intel in a long-running legal battle over copyright. In February, Intel 
settled several issues in a complex patent-infringement dispute with Cyrix.

CBS WIZARD OF PROGRAMMING SAGANSKY TO LEAVE NETWORK; TELEVISION: THE DEPARTURE 
OF THE ENTERTAINMENT DIVISION CHIEF COMES AS RIVAL ABC ADVANCES IN THE RATINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeffrey Sagansky, the programmer who led CBS from the ratings basement to No. 
1 and earned extraordinary financial bonuses in the process, is leaving the 
network. 
</P>
<P>
 Following months of speculation about his plans, Sagansky informed his bosses 
in New York last week that he is not renewing his contract. As expected, 
Sagansky will be succeeded by Peter Tortorici, his longtime lieutenant, who has 
been named president of CBS Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 The management changes occur at a pivotal time, with ABC mounting a challenge 
to CBS' three-year ratings dominance. ABC is wrapping up its best season since 
1978-79, has the most successful new shows of any network and is closing the 
ratings gap that separates it from CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Sagansky says he has no job plans but felt it was time to move on after 4 1/2 
years. "When it came right down to it, I was hired to do a very specific job," 
he said. "That was to return the network to profitability and a competitive 
position. I feel that has been accomplished. . . . I just wanted a new 
challenge, something maybe a bit more entrepreneurial." 
</P>
<P>
 Sagansky's name has been linked to top jobs at both Sony Pictures and MCA 
Inc., as well as a possible partnership deal at Savoy Pictures. He says he has 
"not had a serious conversation with anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 When Sagansky become president of CBS Entertainment in January, 1990, the 
network was bracing for a loss of more than $220 million, largely triggered by 
write-downs associated with football and baseball contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 The network's prime-time entertainment schedule was also in shambles. CBS was 
losing every night of the week except Sunday, when the stalwart "60 Minutes" 
and "Murder, She Wrote" still drew large, if decidedly older, audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Sagansky, the entertainment division rebuilt the prime-time schedule 
with younger-appealing shows on Monday, such as "Murphy Brown" and "Northern 
Exposure," and on Saturday with "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman." Last year the CBS 
network had an operating profit of about $250 million, its highest level since 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Sagansky was handsomely rewarded for such success due to a pay package that 
was pegged to the network's ratings and financial performance. In 1992 he 
earned $6.1 million for catapulting the network from third to first place and 
last year earned a total of $7.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 This week Sagansky receives his third sizable bonus, the amount of which will 
not be disclosed until next year's CBS proxy statement. 
</P>
<P>
 But CBS executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that if Sagansky 
had stayed, he would not have been given the same kind of lucrative contract he 
was awarded upon joining the company. CBS Inc. Chief Executive Laurence Tisch 
was "never going to give another contract like that," said one senior CBS 
executive. "That was clear from the start." 
</P>
<P>
 Sagansky may have personal reasons for moving on. His Santa Monica home 
overlooking the ocean was hit hard by the Jan. 17 earthquake, and several weeks 
ago he put the house on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Tortorici's appointment to succeed Sagansky was a foregone 
conclusion because it was guaranteed in his contract. The former trial lawyer, 
who was the network's chief programming strategist, is moving swiftly to put 
his own team in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Tortorici has brought in Larry Sanitsky, a partner in the independent 
production firm Konigsberg/Sanitsky, as executive vice president, overseeing 
all program development and production operations. In addition, Steve Warner 
has been promoted to senior vice president of scheduling and current programs. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS has also brought in David Himmelfarb, a senior vice president with 
Witt-Thomas Productions, as vice president of comedy development. Himmelfarb 
succeeds Tim Flack, who becomes vice president of creative affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sagansky, some observers think, may be leaving at CBS' high-water mark. 
Although CBS' prime-time ratings are up 6% this season, most of that is due to 
the 16 days of highly rated Olympics coverage. When Olympics and other special 
programming is excluded, ABC is only 0.2 ratings points behind CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, ABC attracts more viewers aged 18 to 49, which is the audience 
most coveted by national advertisers. And the network has this season's 
highest-rated new comedy series, "Grace Under Fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Tortorici disputed the notion that ABC is gaining momentum and said that much 
of its strength in new programs comes from scheduling them behind mega-hits 
"Roseanne" and "Home Improvement." He said that new CBS series such as "Dave's 
World" on Monday night and "The Nanny" on Wednesday night have shown strength 
without comparable lead-in programming. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS also announced Thursday that David Kenin has been named president of CBS 
Sports, succeeding Neil Pilson, who earlier had been appointed to a new 
position at the network.

 Haven't filed your tax return yet? There's still time and help available.  
</P>
<P>
 * Where to go for last-minute mailing: Internal Revenue Service employees will 
be at the following Los Angeles-area post offices today from about 6:30 p.m. to 
midnight to provide last-minute filers with tax forms and other help.These 
locations will also be open late to accommodate you if you need that important 
April 15 postmark.

<P>
 * 5800 W. Century Blvd., Westchester

</P>
<P>
 * How to file for an extension: If you can't make the deadline, file a Form 
4868, which gives you another four months to procrastinate. You are supposed to 
pay any tax that you think you still owe when you send in the extension 
request, but if you can't, don't. Interest on the amount you owe will accrue at 
a 7% annual rate, and there's a failure-to-pay penalty of half a percent a 
month, says Rob Giannangeli, an IRS spokesman. But starting this year, there is 
no longer a late-filing penalty -- that's the onerous 5%-a-month charge -- for 
failing to send a check. KATHY M. KRISTOF

SURVEY OF GARMENT INDUSTRY FINDS RAMPANT LABOR ABUSE; WORKPLACE: THE RANDOM 
INSPECTIONS TURN UP NUMEROUS VIOLATIONS OF STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a groundbreaking survey of workplace abuses, state and federal inspectors 
uncovered rampant violations of safety and labor laws among California garment 
makers, including cases of bosses locking fire exits and children as young as 
13 working nine-hour days. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, released Thursday in Los Angeles, is based on random inspections 
this year of 69 garment manufacturers and contractors. The survey found that 
all but two of the firms were breaking either federal or state laws or both. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an industry that ignores the law," said Maria Echaveste, the Labor 
Department enforcement chief for minimum-wage and overtime violations. 
</P>
<P>
 The statewide study -- which covered garment manufacturers from San Diego to 
the Bay Area to Stockton -- found the most widespread abuses in Los Angeles and 
Orange counties, which have the state's biggest concentration of garment sewing 
and fabric cutting shops. 
</P>
<P>
 State and federal authorities said the survey marks the first time government 
officials have taken a random look at an industry to determine the severity of 
its workplace safety and labor law abuses. They said they singled out the 
California garment manufacturing industry because of its size and rogue 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 The most serious violations were the use of child labor at two shops and about 
10 instances in which workers were at risk of being trapped inside in the event 
of a fire because doors were either locked or blocked. In all, more than a 
third of the 69 firms were said to have serious safety problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said their discovery of garment shops with locked or blocked exits 
brought to mind such tragedies as the 1991 fire at the Imperial Food Products 
chicken-processing plant in North Carolina, where 25 people were killed after 
being trapped inside the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, officials said, the garment shops routinely failed to pay minimum wage 
and overtime. In one instance, a contractor paid as little as $3 an hour, far 
below the $4.25-an-hour federal standard. 
</P>
<P>
 "If our survey results are indicative of the industry as a whole, then garment 
workers currently working in the sewing shops are owed tens of millions in back 
wages," said William Buhl, San Francisco-based regional administrator of the 
Labor Department's Wage and Hour Division. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, at a number of the firms inspectors found only 
record-keeping problems or minor safety violations that did not pose serious 
risks to workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Lax, president of the trade group Coalition of Apparel Industries in 
California, countered that government officials "are painting the whole 
industry with the same brush, but I do think there are a lot of people who obey 
the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Lax said he had not seen the survey, but he questioned whether it is truly a 
random sampling of the industry. He also complained that while industry leaders 
want to clean up abuses, government officials have refused to work with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their attitude is they're going to go on their own agenda and do what they're 
going to do without any industry input," Lax said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 69 firms in the survey, seven were ordered closed by authorities 
because they failed to buy workers' compensation insurance to cover employees 
hurt on the job. In addition, penalties totaling $1.14 million were imposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they will use the study's findings to judge the effectiveness 
of future efforts to crack down on apparel industry sweatshops, the worst of 
which tend to be small contractors. Echaveste said one of the key enforcement 
strategies will be to pressure the contractors' customers: big and often 
well-known garment marketers and manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, she said she plans to expand use of a 1938 law known as the "hot 
goods" statute, which bars interstate transport of goods made at companies that 
violate federal labor laws. In a major precedent in 1992, the Labor Department 
investigated Guess Inc., Southern California's biggest apparel firm, under the 
hot goods statute and extracted an agreement making the company responsible for 
its contractors' labor practices. 
</P>
<P>
 California Labor Commissioner Victoria Bradshaw, while also promising 
stepped-up enforcement, said the problems of the industry will persist until 
the flow of illegal immigrants to the state is curbed. She said that few 
undocumented workers who work in the industry file complaints against abusive 
employers for fear their immigration status will be discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a whole pool of people who are very vulnerable" to abuse, Bradshaw 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials contended that, notwithstanding the severity and frequency of 
violations found in the survey, there was some good news in the results. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, they noted that a casual, non-random survey of garment firms in 
1992 found that about 80% were failing to pay the minimum wage over proper 
overtime pay. By comparison, the survey released Thursday showed that 50% 
violated minimum-wage rules and 68% violated overtime requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 However, officials acknowledged that despite their efforts to ensure a random 
sampling of apparel firms, the biggest potential offenders -- firms operating 
completely underground and not paying taxes -- may have been under-represented 
in the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 The study was conducted under the Targeted Industries Partnership Program, an 
educational and enforcement program involving the Labor Department and 
California's divisions of Labor Standard Enforcement and Occupational Safety 
and Health. Workplace Abuses 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent survey of 69 California garment manufacturers and contractors 
chosen at random, investigators uncovered rampant violations of safety and 
labor laws. The following figures reflect the percentages of companies found to 
be violating the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Type of violations found: Health and safety: 92.8% Record-keeping: 72.5% 
Overtime: 68.1% Minimum wage: 50.7% Cash payments: 30.4% Illegal work at home: 
14.5% Child labor: 2.9% * 
</P>
<P>
 Violation facts: 
</P>
<P>
 * Employers that were investigated had an average of 4.17 violations each. 
</P>
<P>
 * On average, employers were found to owe $218.84 in back wages per employee 
for the period covering the 90 days preceding the investigation.

 Mortgage Rates Drop: Mortgage rates declined this week for the first time in 
two months as 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 8.26%, the Federal Home 
Loan Mortgage Corp. said. The rate was down from last week's 8.47%, the highest 
in nearly two years.This week's rate is still about 1.5 percentage points above 
the 25-year low of 6.74% seen in October. The last time rates dropped was the 
week of Feb. 17, when the 30-year rate slipped from 7.21% the week before to 
7.11%. On one-year, adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an average 
initial rate of 4.96% this week, unchanged from last week. Fifteen-year 
mortgages, a popular option for those refinancing mortgages, averaged 7.72% 
this week, down from 7.91% a week earlier.

BIRTCHER WEIGHS OPTIONS IN LIGHT OF DECLINING PROFIT MARGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE MICHAUD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After losing money for the past two years, Birtcher Medical Systems Inc. said 
Thursday that it is considering selling all or part of its operations, or 
attempting a recapitalization. 
</P>
<P>
 William E. Maya, president and chief executive of the Irvine-based maker of 
surgical supplies, said in a statement that the company is weighing several 
options. 
</P>
<P>
 "While evaluating these opportunities, Birtcher received an offer to purchase 
its Solos endoscopy division, as well as proposals from several different 
groups to purchase Birtcher's . . . physician office product line, Hyfrecator," 
Maya said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the company is also exploring the sale of shares outside the 
United States or seeking a loan. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the company's statement, Nasdaq trading in Birtcher shares was 
nearly five times the daily average on Thursday. The stock closed at $2, down 
25 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said Birtcher is most valuable in one piece and may be especially 
attractive to two competitors: Conmed Corp., a Utica, N.Y.-based maker of 
disposable medical devices, and Valley Lab, a division of pharmaceuticals giant 
Pfizer Inc. of New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Lab currently has a license to market Birtcher's argon beam coagulator 
technology, which cauterizes wounds during surgery with a tiny beam of argon 
gas. Mark Matheson, an analyst with Crowell, Weedon & Co. in Los Angeles, said 
Valley Lab would not want the technology to fall into the hands of competitor 
Conmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many manufacturers of medical products, Birtcher has been hurt by tight 
hospital budgets, analysts said. They added that the trend in the rapidly 
consolidating hospital industry is toward one-stop shopping for supplies from 
companies with diverse products -- from surgical tools to drugs to intravenous 
therapy equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Birtcher has had declining margins, declining sales and a difficult operating 
environment," said Evan Sturza, editor of Sturza's Medical Investment Letter in 
New York. "This is really too small a company to compete in this marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
 The company said the Solos endoscopic products division, which makes tiny 
instruments for small-incision surgery, in particular has had declining sales 
and profit. The company also said it has met with obstacles and delays in 
bringing new products to market. 
</P>
<P>
 Birtcher, which employs about 220 people in Irvine, reported a loss of $1.3 
million on sales of $20.2 million during the first six months of the year ended 
June 30. In 1993, the company lost $1.9 million on revenue of $42 million.

VIOLENCE HITS MOST FIRMS, SURVEY SAYS; WORKPLACE: MORE THAN HALF OF U.S. 
COMPANIES HAD INCIDENTS IN LAST FOUR YEARS. EARLY INTERVENTION IS NEEDED, 
ANALYST REPORTS. 
</P>

<P>
 Violence leading to serious injury or death has become a frightening reality 
in the workplace, with more than half of U.S. companies reporting incidents or 
threats of violence in the past four years, a survey says. 
</P>
<P>
 One-third of the companies said violence occurred more than once, according to 
the survey by the American Management Assn. made available Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The violence in the streets of America has opened the door and walked into 
the workplace," said Chris Hatcher, clinical professor of psychology at the 
University of California, San Francisco, who helped interpret the data. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the findings point to "the need to apply coordinated early 
intervention to prevent more incidents." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 589 human resources executives surveyed at the association's human 
resources conference being held in San Francisco, 26% said the most recent 
incident was instigated by an employee, with another 10% caused by a former 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Six percent said a client or customer created the problem, and 6% blamed 
outsiders with no previously known connection to the company. 
</P>
<P>
 More than one-third of the incidents resulted in death or serious injury, the 
survey showed. Death occurred in 16% of the incidents, with another 19% 
resulting in injuries requiring hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
 A greater number of reported incidents claimed multiple victims (45%) than 
single victims (38%). 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was the attacker's co-worker in 28% of the cases, companies 
reported. A direct supervisor was the victim in 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 The nature of the most recent incident involved threats of violence (45%), 
assault with a weapon (18%) and harassment (14%), the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most companies had to learn the hard way how to deal with violence, the survey 
showed. It was not until a serious incident occurred that 44% of them began 
training programs to deal with the problem, compared with only 20% of companies 
with no direct experience with workplace violence. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Eric Greenberg, the association's director of management studies, 
"there are usually early warning signs, particularly when employees are 
involved. All too often symptoms are ignored until the situation becomes 
severe." 
</P>
<P>
 A quarter of the respondents reporting violent incidents said early signs of 
trouble had been ignored by the eventual victim, and the same proportion said 
signs were ignored by others within the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey was conducted for the American Management Assn., a not-for-profit 
management education group, by Technometrica Applied Quantitative Research, of 
Emerson, N.J.

DOLLAR RISES AFTER GERMANY LOWERS RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dollar closed mostly higher against major foreign currencies Thursday 
after German and other European central banks lowered key interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue chip stocks rallied to close slightly higher after early losses spurred 
by news of the mistaken downing of two U.S. Army helicopters in northern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany's central bank lowered its discount rate to 5.00% from 5.25% and the 
Lombard rate to 6.50% from 6.75% effective today. 
</P>
<P>
 The greenback closed at 1.7103 German marks in New York, up from 1.7093 on 
Wednesday. A drop in foreign interest rates usually bolsters the dollar because 
it makes U.S. investments -- which are bought with U.S. dollars -- more 
attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lombard rate is the rate at which banks can borrow emergency funds from 
the central bank. The discount rate is the cheapest form of bank refinancing. 
Central banks in Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark 
also cut their rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Nelson, a foreign exchange dealer at the Royal Bank of Canada, said the 
dollar did not rally against the mark as much as expected because the mark was 
being purchased with other foreign currencies using the dollar as an 
intermediary. That is known as cross-trading. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 1.78 points at 3,663.25, having 
recovered from drop of more than 20 points. Declining issues led advances on 
the New York Stock Exchange, 1,215 to 923, but analysts said gains in oil 
company shares, including Dow components Chevron, Texaco and Exxon, boosted the 
index. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market largely ignored a Labor Department report that first-time 
claims for jobless benefits jumped by 12,000 last week to 348,000, the highest 
level in more than a month. Many analysts had expected a decline. 
</P>
<P>
 There was also little impact from a report that business inventories rose 0.5% 
in February while sales increased at a more rapid pace of 1.2% -- the biggest 
gain in either indicator since November. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mistakes in the Middle East were costly today," said Dudley Eppel, 
managing director of equity trading at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities. 
"That might have taken some of the traders out of the market." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, "As long as interest rates are not recovering, I think we're going 
to struggle with this market." 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury yields finished higher Thursday as the market grew jittery over 
economic figures due today that could give the Federal Reserve Board an excuse 
to raise interest rates again. The market is turning its attention to the 
somewhat obscure capacity utilization report due today. 
</P>
<P>
 The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond fell 11/32 point, or $3.44 per 
$1,000 in face value, while its yield rose to 7.28% from 7.25% on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among trading highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology issues fell for the third consecutive session, led by Motorola, 
which slid again following a disappointing earnings report Tuesday. Motorola 
fell 3 7/8 to 91 5/8. Hewlett Packard fell 1 3/4 to 78 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Traders linked the rise in oil stocks to the first news out of Iraq, but 
others said the shares were also helped by upbeat analysts' comments and higher 
oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevron, aided by a "buy" recommendation from Salomon Bros., gained 2 3/8 to 
88 3/8. Occidental Petroleum rose 7/8 to 16 1/8 after another Salomon upgrade, 
made because of optimism about the company's chemical business. Exxon rose 1 
1/8 to 62 7/8 and Texaco added 3/8 at 63 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May oil contract rose 26 cents to end 
at $16.23 a barrel, a new high for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets: 
</P>
<P>
 * Share prices in Hong Kong tumbled on profit taking, ending a string of six 
consecutive gains as turnover waned again, brokers said. The blue chip Hang 
Seng index ended just above the day's low, down 153.13 points at 9,600.63 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tokyo stocks ended mixed, but dealers said sentiment perked up as investors 
dismissed the yen's strength and Japanese political turmoil after Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa announced his resignation. The Nikkei average ended 
73.21 points lower at 19,987.20, dropping back below the 20,000-level. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold prices rose. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current 
delivery closed at $378.60 an ounce, up 40 cents.

CONTRACT TALKS TO REOPEN IN TRUCKING STRIKE; LABOR: TEAMSTERS WALKOUT WILL 
CONTINUE DURING RENEWED NEGOTIATIONS. PREVIOUS 'FINAL OFFER' IS SET ASIDE.

<P>
 Striking Teamsters and trucking firms Thursday agreed to resume negotiations 
next week and try to resolve the 8-day-old walkout involving 70,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Teamsters strike against 20 trucking firms will continue during the talks 
-- scheduled to begin Monday -- and the union was planning a separate campaign 
aimed at some of the transportation companies' financial backers and directors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're prepared to sit down at any time and talk about any of the problems," 
said Ron Carey, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. 
"Whether or not we can agree upon any of those issues is another question." 
</P>
<P>
 Talks between the Teamsters and Truck Management Inc., the bargaining arm for 
the struck companies, broke off March 31 over what management described as its 
final offer, which included proposals for using more part-time workers at truck 
terminals and making more use of rail freight. The companies also want to use 
binding arbitration to settle future grievances. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter sent to the Teamsters on Wednesday, the trucking firms indicated 
that the March 31 proposals no longer constituted a final offer, Carey said, 
and that led both sides on Thursday afternoon to agree to resume talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are delighted that we will now sit down and discuss all the issues so 
critical to our industry, our company and our employees," said Robert A. Young 
III, chairman of Trucking Management Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the U.S. Departments of Transportation and Labor were also in 
contact with both sides, seeking to revive the negotiations. Transportation 
Secretary Federico Pena spoke to Carey after the resumption of talks was 
announced, but the content of their conversation was unknown, Teamsters 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the strike continues, Teamsters will also begin protests aimed at 
companies, customers and officials linked to the trucking firms, Carey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The union said its members across the country will distribute leaflets outside 
the tax preparation offices of H&R Block today. The leaflets will point out 
that H&R president Thomas M. Bloch sits on the board of Yellow Corp., which 
operates Yellow Freight, the largest of the strck companies.

MCDONNELL DOUGLAS WINS $400-MILLION SATELLITE CONTRACT

 McDonnell Douglas Corp. said Thursday that it has won a contract from Motorola 
Corp. valued at more than $400 million to launch 40 communications satellites 
for Iridium, a proposed mobile phone communications system. 
</P>
<P>
 While the contract will generate some new jobs at Vandenburg Air Force Base 
near Lompoc, Calif., the Iridium award will not affect employment in Huntington 
Beach, where McDonnell Douglas manufacturers the Delta rockets that will carry 
the satellites into space. 
</P>
<P>
 The $3.37-billion Iridium system is one of several competing systems that 
promise to deliver wireless, hand-held telecommunications services via 
satellites. McDonnell Douglas plans to use eight Delta II launch vehicles to 
place 40 satellites in orbit. Each rocket will carry five satellites into 
space. The Iridium consortium intends to use rockets from Russia and China to 
launch the remaining 26 satellites. 
</P>
<P>
 The Iridium contract is the largest commercial launch contract ever won by 
McDonnell Douglas. The company has been launching military versions of the 
Delta rocket for 16 years and has had 48 consecutive successful launches since 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rocketdyne Division of Rockwell International Corp. in Canoga Park will 
build the Delta II's first-stage main engine. Aerojet's Propulsion Division is 
Sacramento is building the second-stage engine.

HIGHEST-PAID EXECUTIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The $203.1 million that Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner pulled down 
last year was the highest pay ever for a chief executive of a public 
corporation, Business Week magazine reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 He earned nearly four times more than the second-highest-paid executive in 
1993, Sanford Weill, head of Travelers Corp., who earned $52.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner, long among the highest-paid executives, earned the amount despite the 
fact that Disney's profit fell last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of Eisner's total package was $202.3 million in long-term 
compensation through the exercise of stock options. His salary and bonuses 
amounted to $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The following is a list of the 10 highest-paid U.S. chief executives and their 
total pay in 1993, according to the magazine's April 25 issue. 03,22,19,15

PRUDENTIAL INSURANCE'S RATING LOWERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A.M. Best & Co. lowered its rating Thursday of giant Prudential Insurance Co., 
citing uncertainty caused by the continuing legal woes of the company's Wall 
Street brokerage, Prudential Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts viewed the ratings drop, although small, as a sign that the 
brokerage's limited-partnership debacle is having an impact on the parent 
company.They also warned it could affect Prudential's competitive position in 
selling new policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Newark, N.J.-based Prudential is the nation's largest insurance company in 
terms of assets and number of policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Best lowered its rating of the firm's ability to pay insurance claims to A+, 
the rating agency's second-highest mark, from A++, its highest rating. Best 
said both ratings are considered superior. 
</P>
<P>
 It attributed the reduction to Prudential Securities' legal liabilities as 
well as the possibility that one of Prudential Insurance's own real estate 
funds may have to pay a large settlement to customers. Best also cited 
Prudential's "exposure to underperforming real estate investments." 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential disagreed with the downgrade, which it said "does not reflect the 
company's strong financial performance." The company noted that its total 
capital increased by $869 million to nearly $11 billion in 1993.

 Underfunding of Pension Program Up 39.5% in a Year: The Pension Benefit 
Guaranty Corp. said its pension protection program was underfunded by $53 
billion at the end of 1992, the most recent year for which figures are 
available.That's up 39.5% from the $38-billion shortfall at the end of 1991, 
according to the PBGC's annual report to Congress. The $53-billion shortfall 
for 1992, first reported in January, is the result of the PBGC's attempt to 
cover $11.3 billion of liabilities for pension payments with just $8.4 billion 
in its fund. While the PBGC has money to cover pensions under financially 
troubled plans now, it will run into trouble later unless the fund receives 
more money.

 Sales Outpace Inventories; Jobless Claims Jump: Business inventories rose in 
February for the sixth time in the last seven months, but they were outpaced by 
sales as both indicators scored their biggest gains since November. Analysts 
said the Commerce Department figures, generally in line with economists' 
predictions, indicate there is room for manufacturing expansion in the months 
ahead.In another report, the Labor Department said the number of Americans 
filing first-time claims for jobless benefits jumped by a surprising 12,000 
last week to the highest level in more than a month. Most economists, expecting 
an improving unemployment picture, had forecast a decline. The Labor Department 
said new applications for unemployment insurance totaled 348,000, up from a 
revised 336,000 during the week ended April 2.

 More Money Flows Into Money Market Funds: Faced with falling prices in the 
nation's financial markets, more money was funneled into money market funds in 
the week ended Wednesday, the Investment Company Institute said. Assets of the 
nation's money market funds increased by $6.34 billion, or 1.1%, to $607.36 
billion, from $601.02 billion on April 6, the institute said. The report 
provides more evidence that investors moved money from stock and bond funds, an 
ICI spokeswoman said.

 Philip Morris Considers Separating Tobacco Business: The company, responding 
to reports in the Financial Times, said the plan to separate its tobacco and 
food businesses will be aimed at enhancing its "business prospects," but it 
described the proposal as part of periodic reviews with the company's 
board.Separating its two main businesses was only one option being studied, the 
company said. The Financial Times, citing Philip Morris Chief Financial Officer 
Hans Storr, said the plan would aim to shelter the company's profitable foods 
operations from problems affecting the tobacco business. Storr said such a 
separation could enhance the value of Philip Morris' shares.

Target stores division, takes over as CEO immediately and will become chairman 
in July, the company said. Analysts said they do not think the action implies 
any change in corporate strategy and said there is no indication that the 
55-year-old Macke was pushed out. Target, which Ulrich headed since 1987, has 
become the company's fastest-growing division.

 Hamburger Hamlet Chief Resigns: Hamburger Hamlet Restaurants Inc. said 
Chairman and Chief Executive Thomas A. McFall resigned as part of an agreement 
with a major shareholder group. The faction, HAMB Investors Group, last month 
indicated it might seek McFall's resignation as part of a plan to try to 
improve earnings at the Sherman Oaks-based company.HAMB Investors owns 16.2% of 
Hamburger Hamlet, which operates 23 restaurants in California and 14 in other 
parts of the nation. The company said its directors elected fellow board member 
James J. Gaffney to replace McFall as chairman. Gaffney is chief operating 
officer of KDI Industries, a Cincinnati-based manufacturer of swimming pools 
and electronic components for military weapons systems. Another board member, 
Jack A. Lavine, was selected for the post of chief executive. Lavine founded 
the Chili's restaurant chain.

 Study Calls Natural Gas Cars Clean as Electric: Though air-polluting emissions 
at the tailpipe remain more than for electric cars -- which have none at all -- 
natural gas vehicles are "comparable" to electric vehicles when the total fuel 
cycle of each is compared, according to a study by the Gas Research Institute, 
a trade group. The institute called for amending the California Air Resources 
Board rules, currently under review, to count air pollution created at all 
stages of fuel consumption. That would have the rule cover pollution from 
electricity-generating power plants, not just electric cars.

 Bally's Health & Tennis Corp. Settles Charges: The nation's largest health 
club chain agreed to pay refunds to possibly thousands of current and former 
members to settle Federal Trade Commission charges of deceptive billing, 
cancellation and refund practices.Bally's, which has 4 million members 
nationwide, also agreed to pay $120,000 in civil penalties. It did not admit 
any wrongdoing. The FTC alleged that Bally's made it impossible for people to 
quit the clubs and charged members' credit cards or bank accounts without 
authorization. In February, a related company, Bally's Holiday Spa Health 
Clubs, agreed to pay $138,062 to settle charges of false advertising brought by 
the Los Angeles district attorney's office.

TURF WAR GROWS OVER MONITORING OF BANK MUTUAL FUND SALES; REGULATION: BOTH THE 
SEC AND COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY TELL CONGRESS THEY CAN DO A BETTER JOB OF 
PROTECTING INVESTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Banking regulators battled with the nation's top securities regulator Thursday 
over who can do the best job of protecting unwary investors who buy mutual 
funds through banks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a new ballgame with millions of new investors, many of them 
unsophisticated," Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. 
told the finance subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, whose 
leaders are backing a bill to give the SEC oversight over bank mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 But Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig, who regulates banks and does 
not want to cede any of his authority, insisted that "investor protection is 
central to our mission." 
</P>
<P>
 Ludwig said he is willing to get help from the National Assn. of Securities 
Dealers to train bank employees who sell mutual funds, but he told the 
subcommittee his agency should retain the final regulatory powers to search for 
any abuses in sales and marketing of funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Reserve Board Gov. John LaWare joined Ludwig in a solid front of 
opposition to new SEC activity at banks, saying the Fed "is committed to 
closely monitoring banks' securities sales practices." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue has erupted in the past two years as falling interest rates on bank 
certificates of deposits sent many investors, particularly retired Americans, 
in search of higher yields. Many of them began buying mutual funds through the 
banks where they had savings accounts. More than 1,000 mutual funds are 
available through more than 100 banks, and the funds' assets total $219 
billion, Levitt told the subcommittee hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Surveys show that many investors fail to understand that mutual funds lack the 
federal protection given to the first $100,000 in bank deposits. 
</P>
<P>
 Ludwig contends he can deal with that problem through an aggressive program of 
education and enforcement, forcing banks to disclose to customers in 
easy-to-understand terms that mutual funds are not insured and that the 
investment itself is at risk as markets fluctuate. 
</P>
<P>
 The comptroller would also send secret shoppers into banks, posing as 
investors, to see what bank marketers tell them about the safety and 
suitability of various investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The securities industry supports the SEC position that the same agency 
regulating stocks and mutual funds should continue to exercise control when the 
funds are sold through banks. The "growing duplication and overlap of 
activities of the securities regulators and the banking regulators must be 
eliminated," Joseph Hardiman, president and chief executive of the National 
Assn. of Securities Dealers, told the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar endorsement came from Matthew P. Fink, president of the Investment 
Company Institute, which represents the mutual fund industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as the brokers and mutual funds lined up in support of their regulators 
at the SEC, the banking industry backed the positions of its own regulators. 
The current system "is operating successfully," said Richard H. Jones of Fleet 
Investment Services, testifying on behalf of the American Bankers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a dissenter from the ranks, however. Mellon Bank, which is acquiring 
the Dreyfus family of funds, said it supports SEC regulation of bank mutual 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Banking regulators are likely to prevail, in the short run at least, because 
of congressional turf issues. The House and Senate Banking committees won't 
accept legislation taking power away from banking authorities and giving it to 
the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
 The advocates for change are the leaders of the Energy and Commerce Committee, 
which handles the SEC. When powerful committees clash, the result is usually 
stalemate.

 The speed and efficiency of overnight delivery services has attracted a new 
breed of customer: the con artist. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Consumers League reports that 46% of telemarketing scams now 
involve overnight delivery services, up from 5% less than two years ago. In 
raids of telemarketing boiler rooms in Los Angeles and Orange counties this 
week, authorities found evidence that express delivery services were used to 
pick up checks from victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is something we've been seeing more and more," said Lindsey Kozberg of the 
state Department of Corporations, which conducted the raids. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say such operations usually involve "investment opportunities" or 
"prize" promotions. After selling the pitch over the telephone, a telemarketer 
sends Federal Express or another delivery service to the person's home to pick 
up a check for payment. 
</P>
<P>
 The sums involved can be substantial. In several cases investigated by the 
Federal Trade Commission, investors have paid from $7,000 to $20,000 each for 
stakes in various partnerships developing wireless communications systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend is an embarrassment to overnight delivery companies, which have 
reputations for reliability and trustworthiness. A Harris Poll commissioned by 
the National Consumers League 18 months ago found that more than 75% of 
consumers believed an offer would be legitimate if delivered by Federal 
Express. 
</P>
<P>
 However, representatives of overnight delivery companies said they cannot 
refuse to deal with suspected con artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are required by law to treat customers equally," said John Handy, a 
spokesman for Seattle-based Airborne Express. "If we have information that 
something may be illegal, we turn it over to law enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
 There are several reasons con artists like to use overnight delivery services, 
authorities and consumer advocates say. For one thing, using a delivery service 
allows con artists to avoid prosecution under the federal law against 
fraudulent use of the U.S. mails. The mail fraud statutes are handy tools for 
prosecuting con artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you've shown a fraud has been committed, it is fairly easy to show the 
mail was involved," said Paula Prince, spokeswoman for the Postal Inspection 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Use of overnight delivery services also avoids glitches with over-the-phone 
credit card transactions. John Barker, National Consumers League vice 
president, said consumers can reverse credit card purchases if the merchandise 
or service is not delivered or proves unsatisfactory, making it hard for the 
con artists to collect. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is real easy is to send someone by to pick up a check," Barker said. 
"Once (con artists) get your check, it is very difficult to get it back from 
them." A consumer cannot stop payment on a check after it clears. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with the National Consumers League, Federal Express last fall began to 
deal with the problem. Its couriers distribute warnings about fraud to likely 
victims, generally package recipients in residential areas. "Beware," the 
warning notice says, adding that the company is "not part of any organization 
offering prizes, special purchases, loans or investment opportunities." The 
notice bears a toll-free phone number customers can call if they think they 
might be fraud victims. 
</P>
<P>
 On another front, five bills pending in Congress would make it a crime to use 
an overnight delivery service to commit fraud. Consumer activists and Federal 
Express support the legislation. 
</P>

 What the government giveth, companies sell: "State and Federal Posting 
Requirements," said the envelope from the California Poster Compliance Center. 
Inside was an order form for "mandatory state posters" and "mandatory federal 
posters." The order form notes: "Failure to post the above notices . . . may 
result in civil and-or criminal penalties." 
</P>
<P>
 That alone may be enough for an employer to send the Poster Compliance Center 
in Sacramento $24.50 for a set of posters about wage and workplace safety laws 
that all employers are required to display. But hold the pen! The government 
distributes these posters free. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Glazer, manager of Poster Compliance, said the company provides a 
service because employers frequently don't know which posters are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the California Chamber of Commerce will tell employers which posters 
they need. Joe Willman, marketing director for the chamber, notes that 
employers who don't want to call all nine government agencies can buy a set of 
posters from the Chamber for $10.

 Tax day note: The Washington-based Women's Law Center graded the states 
according to their tax provisions for families who must pay for costly child 
care or dependent-adult care. California was among 17 states receiving an F for 
having no child-care or dependent-care allowance or deduction. Minnesota was 
the only state to receive an A. The advocacy group said families spend between 
6% and 23% of their weekly incomes on child care.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: JAFFE, FORCED OUT OF PARAMOUNT, SUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As often occurs in corporate soap operas, Stanley Jaffe has moved from the 
boardroom to the courtroom. The former president and chief operating officer of 
Paramount Communications on Thursday filed a lawsuit charging that he was 
deprived of $20 million in stock options and other benefits guaranteed under 
his employment contract when Viacom Inc. acquired the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York state court case accuses Paramount, Viacom and its chairman, 
Sumner Redstone, of misleading Jaffe about his status and "wrongfully" 
frustrating his attempts to exercise stock options in a bid to "rob him" of 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom denied any wrongdoing in a statement Thursday, saying: "We believe our 
handling of Mr. Jaffe's agreement is entirely proper and we are complying with 
all provisions of his contract. We believe his claims are without merit and we 
are confident that we will prevail." 
</P>
<P>
 Jaffe, 53, was forced out of his job in February, after Viacom won the 
$10-billion bidding war for Paramount. At the time, published reports valued 
his exit package at about $60 million, but on Thursday, sources said his 
contract puts the amount closer to $35 million. That includes his annual salary 
and benefits of about $3.5 million through 1997, plus the stock options. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 14-page lawsuit, Jaffe says he first learned that his job was in 
jeopardy by reading "media reports." Subsequent efforts to discuss his status 
with senior Viacom executives were rebuffed, according to the suit. Jaffe says 
that his duties were "materially reduced" by mid-February, and that he was 
excluded from meetings of the company. Former Paramount Chairman Martin S. 
Davis finally gave him formal notice he had been fired on Feb. 28, the suit 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue in the case are 466,668 shares of Paramount stock that Jaffe says he 
had the right to exercise at $42.125 a share under his employment agreement. 
The lawsuit says Jaffe was "ready, willing and able" to exercise those options, 
but that Paramount refused to make the stock available, thereby depriving him 
of the chance to cash in at as much as $107 a share by the March 1 deadline 
that was established for Paramount shareholders to tender to Viacom. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say Jaffe and his attorney unsuccessfully tried to resolve the issue 
before the suit was filed. One source hinted that other Paramount employees may 
bring similar claims, but Viacom's stance appears to be that Jaffe's case is 
unique because he was seeking favored treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaffe was named Paramount's president and chief operating officer in 1991. He 
got high marks in some quarters for building the company's Madison Square 
Garden-based sports franchises -- the New York Rangers and New York Knicks -- 
but was criticized over the company's lackluster earnings, and had a reputation 
for imperiousness and a fierce temper. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaffe is seeking $20 million in compensatory damages, plus unspecified 
punitive damages. 
</P>

 After selling the rights to a still-unpublished novel for an unprecedented 
$3.75 million last year, best-selling author John Grisham may be poised to set 
another Hollywood record. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say the bidding is heating up over "A Time to Kill," Grisham's first 
and most personal novel. Warner Bros., Paramount Pictures and producer Jon 
Peters are among those said to be in the running. While Grisham's agent, Marti 
Blumenthal, and attorney, Keith Fleer, declined comment, one Hollywood source 
puts the asking price at close to $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Grisham's legal thrillers have translated well to the screen so far, which is 
the main reason for Hollywood's intense interest. "The Firm," purchased for 
$600,000 in 1991, grossed $158.3 million at the domestic box office for 
Paramount. And "The Pelican Brief" which Warner Bros. bought for $1.3 million, 
took in $100.7 million domestically. Warner bought the rights to "The Client," 
which it plans to release this summer, for $2.5 million. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 With United International Pictures facing an uncertain future in Europe, MGM 
is denying persistent rumors that it plans to exit the overseas distribution 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources have suggested that MGM might pull out as a way to relieve political 
pressure on UIP, which has been accused of dominating European theaters. The 
withdrawal could also save money for MGM, the weakest partner in the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides MGM, UIP distributes movies overseas for Paramount Pictures and 
Universal Pictures. Sources say that MGM's agreement allows it to leave UIP 
with one year's notice. Universal and Paramount are contractually committed to 
the distribution company through the year 2005. 
</P>
<P>
 MGM was able to negotiate the early exit clause because it was having 
financial problems when the partners renewed their UIP commitment in 1990, 
sources say. UIP controls roughly 18% of the European theatrical market. It's 
considered a convenient target for EU commissioners seeking to bolster Europe's 
film industry because it's the only distributor jointly operated by three 
Hollywood studios. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from the studios testified before the Monopolies and Mergers 
Commission in London last week, but any ruling is months away. At issue is 
whether an antitrust waiver for the distributor should be extended.

 Multimedia: In a deal that reflects the evolution of interactive 
entertainment, Los Angeles-based Activision has signed an agreement with 
"Demolition Man" co-screenwriter Peter Lenkov to write and develop a new series 
of CD-ROM computer and video games.Lenkov plans to create a futuristic "cyber 
universe" with characters and stories that may later be adapted to TV and film. 
As new technology has transformed games that were once crude and jerky into 
something more aesthetically akin to interactive movies, with highly realistic 
animation and live-action video, the evolution in plot and character has for 
the most part lagged behind. Now multimedia developers are beginning to turn to 
Hollywood writers to supply more sophisticated stories to match the technology.

 Softened silhouettes require jewelry that moves uninterrupted, notes Frank 
Liberto, a spokesman with Givenchy. "There's a lot of drama in simpler 
designs." Breaking away from its traditional classics, Givenchy responded with 
Les Courbes, a collection based on fluid round shapes finished in silver and 
22-karat gold. "This new direction is more modern (and) sculptural than we've 
done in the past. It has the look of hand-molten metal, not cold but warm." 
Prices are toasty too, ranging from $20 to $125. Party With Sense

 A beaded Versace number for $65? OK, so it's only for the night. But who wants 
to be seen twice in something fabulous? L.A.-based One Night Affair opens a 
super-store Saturday in Westminster, with a selection of rental designer gowns 
and bridal and bridesmaid dresses. It can mean getting into something your life 
savings could never cover. "This is the wave of the future," says owner Sharon 
Gilchrist. "Why not save money on the dress to spend elsewhere?" The 
9,800-square-foot store will also feature Gary's Tux and photography and limo 
services. In Decent Exposure

 Summer's crocheted swimsuits don't have to mean a Brazilian thong. Fuller cut 
maillots in nubby textured fabrics can make just as big a splash. "Women want 
suits that are adaptable and fit their figure," notes Kim Dean, buyer for 
JCPenney. In addition to plenty of texture, Dean says earthy hues set the tone. 
An example is Sessa's one-piece suit ($58). Superstar Revival

 The counterculture is finding Jesus, but it's not faith they're after. Images 
of Christ, the Virgin of Guadalupe and the Sacred Heart have become as trendy 
as wearing a cross. Mexican religious folk art and votive candles started the 
craze. Now street wear and accessory companies, like Hi-Fi, are offering 
several items in their collections. The Costa Mesa label has lighters, chain 
wallets, watches, T-shirts, shirts and chinos trimmed with picture buttons of 
the Holy Family. Designer Sean Barger, who grew up in a "really Catholic 
family," says he's "intrigued by the way people idolize these icons. It 
fascinates me how fanatical my family is." ROSE APODACA JONES

 Good Lord, the hats! They were everywhere! No wonder English women are 
fair-skinned. They live in perpetual shadow. Or so it seemed in the movie. Some 
of the chapeaux were flattering, but that enormous black one Andie MacDowell 
has on in the opening scene was enough to make Mr. Blackwell salivate. It 
looked like a combination LP record and 747 tire. I'm surprised she didn't get 
a compressed vertebra. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: But she (Andie MacDowell as Carrie) was a standout, right? With a topper 
like that, you and Kaleidoscope Eyes (Hugh Grant as Charlie) can't forget her. 
</P>
<P>
 Smart women know that the way to be noticed in a crowd -- especially when 
you're competing with a fetching bride -- is to wear something unforgettable. 
</P>
<P>
 The huge coal hat was the focal point of a classic silhouette that paired a 
flowing black and white, ankle-length skirt with a dramatic, double-breasted 
white jacket. Her only other accessory was a pair of antique drop earrings. Oh, 
and her Pepsodent Smile of course. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Well, OK, next time I go to a wedding I'll wear jockey silks and a diving 
helmet. Gotta get the women's eyes off that handsome groom, y'know. And just to 
make sure I'm thoroughly unforgettable, how about I wear a kilt? 
</P>
<P>
 Actually . . . that wedding at the castle in the Scottish Highlands with 
everybody in traditional Scottish regalia looked like loads of fun. Even for 
the women, it was an occasion to trot out the big plaid scarves and thistle 
pins. For the guys, though, crawling into all that stuff at the beginning of an 
evening like that almost requires a valet. Scottish dress has to be just so, 
and it seems as if there are a million little pins and clasps and buckles and 
chains and belts, all of which have some specific significance and therefore 
can't be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 But you have to wonder: Do all those guys keep that stuff in their closets for 
years just on the outside chance that they'll get invited to a highland 
wedding? 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: It was a movie , ducky. But back to Carrie for a minute. Her best look 
came when she attended the second wedding. Her figure-skimming oyster white 
suit, which was sashed at the waist and paired with a long, pencil-slim skirt, 
took the cake. 
</P>
<P>
 Tres Americain! It was perfectly off-white -- one shouldn't wear snowy 
bridal-white to weddings -- and wildly sophisticated. I saw a similar suit at 
Saks Fifth Avenue at South Coast Plaza recently. It was a summer white by 
Emanuel (Ungaro). I would have bought it -- and had my hair permed just to look 
like Carrie -- but the jacket wasn't tapered at the waist so it made me look 
thick. Carrie wore it with matching oyster stiletto pumps. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: The guys, for the most part, stuck closely to British wedding tradition 
and wore gray morning coats or understated dark suits. The happy exception, 
though, were the occasional magnificent waistcoat (we call 'em vests). 
</P>
<P>
 That big, bearded Falstaffian guy took the prize with a succession of satin 
brocade numbers that screamed across the room like a laser light show. Sure, 
they were gaudy as hell, but that's a guy you're going to remember. And, even 
though the colors were as vivid as colors can get when represented on cloth, I 
didn't think any of the waistcoats were in bad taste. Even Grant got into the 
act with a gold patterned one toward the end of the film. 
</P>
<P>
 So, if any buyers are listening, stock a few of those nifty vests this fall. I 
promise to buy several. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Did you notice -- of course you did -- that Andie MacDowell was 
showcasing the New Woman figure that Mirabella magazine talks about this month? 
Her hips are full. There's meat on her arms. And her face bares not one jutting 
cheekbone! I thought she looked great -- though I didn't care for her wedding 
gown a whit. Her beaded headband, yes -- a perfect frame for those obsidian 
curls. But her too-simple gown looked too big. And her beaded bolero looked too 
small. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: "New Woman" figure? That's gonna be good news for the people who make Dove 
Bars and double-filling Oreos. About time, sez I. I've never heard a guy say 
"Whoa! Check out the set of cheekbones on that number!" 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Guess it didn't matter what she was wearing in the final scene. There she 
and Charlie were, sharing an outpouring during a downpour. Her dove-gray suit 
and matching overcoat get soaked and she's so in love it doesn't matter. So it 
shrinks from a Size 10 to a Size 2. Who needs a perfect fit when you've got 
Kaleidoscope Eyes?

BEHIND THE WHEEL / PAUL DEAN: NEW DAWN FOR DIESEL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Diesel engines are the perfect power for London taxis, tuna boats, Southern 
Pacific locomotives and anything built by Kenworth. 
</P>
<P>
 But automobiles? Crushed velvet seats and push-button transmissions were an 
easier sell. 
</P>
<P>
 One major problem was perpetual engine clatter that suggested the crankshaft 
was developing compound fractures. Diesel owners were easily recognized in the 
dark because their clothes smelled like Kuwait. Everything on any American 
highway -- including joggers and 2-day-old road kills -- moved quicker than a 
diesel car. Whether by GM in the '70s or Volkswagen and Peugeot in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 And these sooty, shaking, pungent engines burn fuel-oil available only at 
service stations where attendants carry baseball bats and hold $10 bills up to 
the light. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which seems to have been lost on usually astute, traditionally cautious 
Mercedes-Benz, which has added a 3.0-liter, six-cylinder diesel sedan to its 
E-Class lineup for 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Stranger still, Mercedes is now selling the E300 Diesel in California, where 
airtight regulations virtually outlawed such cars for puffing more particulates 
and bad gases than bonfires and chain-smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mercedes -- a major player of diesel power since Daimler & Benz trucks in 
1923 and the 260D passenger cars three years later -- says its new engine meets 
all California emissions standards and is proof positive that glow-plug 
technology has cleaned up its act. 
</P>
<P>
 By using four valves per cylinder, by positioning the fuel preparation 
prechamber above the center of the piston face, combustion is fuller, more 
evenly distributed and much more efficient. So particulate emissions, i.e. 
smoke from unburned fuel, are reduced. As is engine clatter, even during cold 
weather starts. 
</P>
<P>
 A system of exhaust gas recirculation plus a ceramic catalytic converter -- 
rare in diesels -- further reduce those elements that offend eyes, bronchiole 
and the state Air Resources Board. 
</P>
<P>
 And diesel fuel has changed. Now there a lite fuel that's low on sulfur. There 
goes most of the whiff of eau d'Arabie . 
</P>
<P>
 Double overhead cams and multivalve technology -- whether on gasoline-powered 
or diesel engines -- always increase mechanical muscle. With the E300, they 
produce 134 horsepower, a solid boost on the 121 horses of the five-cylinder, 
2.5-liter diesel Mercedes has been selling in the United States -- but not 
recently in California -- since 1974. And that little workhorse was 
turbocharged. 
</P>
<P>
 The new engine's major attraction, however, is fuel economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercedes' E320 sedan burns super premium gasoline and delivers 19 m.p.g. in 
town and 25 m.p.g. on interstates. The E300 is powered by diesel costing about 
the same but squeezing 26 city and 32 highway miles from each gallon. 
</P>
<P>
 With a fuel tank holding 23.8 gallons, that translates to a minimum of 750 
miles between fill-ups -- or traveling from Los Angeles to Albuquerque without 
stopping for anything but coffee and personal recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Patrone, product manager for the E-Class, thinks that the public 
misperceives diesel cars and says that the E300 is overdeveloped in terms of 
durability and reliability: 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, we have sold 500,000 diesel cars in the U.S. market, with the bulk 
of 370,000 since 1978. About 93% of those diesels are still on the road . . . 
and our one-million-mile car is a diesel." 
</P>
<P>
 But despite vast improvements, no Mercedes diesel sings as softly as a Lexus 
400. Light it up in a garage, and one realizes that even low-sulfur fuel could 
use a good deodorant. Exhalations of engine and tailpipe still leave a faint 
layer of fine soot on the trunk, and, oddly, heavier, blacker slicks of carbon 
on its beautiful cast-alloy front wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners will need the E300's extended range because service stations pumping 
diesel fuel are entire neighborhoods apart. And 0-60 m.p.h. acceleration time 
of 13.7 seconds means most subcompacts will have its lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Why buy one? 
</P>
<P>
 Durability, reliability and the length of its legs are obvious advantages. At 
$40,000, the E300 also is $2,500 cheaper than its gasoline-propelled 
counterpart. Which, it must be noted, is no longer overpriced when compared to 
the $50,000 sticker shock of a Lexus or Infiniti. 
</P>
<P>
 And no matter the plumbing under the hood, the car carries every nuance and 
all the aura of a Mercedes; from an elegant hush and stolid ride to its broad 
hint of being handcrafted for each buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 But final success rests with the legion of diesel disciples, individualists 
all. Most are repeat owners with enormous dedication to type. They prefer 
practicality before prestige. They care not one whit of being several 
kilometers left of mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are fanatically loyal," Patrone notes. "And we have no intention of 
deserting them." 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from a chromium "Diesel" cutout on the rear deck, the mid-size E300 
shows neither internal nor external differences from gasoline-powered members 
of the mid-size E-Clan. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside are lines of the simple three-box design that is a Mercedes tradition, 
but softer and rounder these days. The interior is leather and wood with all 
control noises muffled, even silenced as the payoff of precision engineering. 
Which nobody does better than Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
 Driver- and passenger-side air bags are standard. So are anti-lock brakes, 
automatic air, power windows, alarm, central locking and cruise control. But 
there's no remote trunk release and a north-to-south transmission hump will 
buckle the legs of the center member of any rear-seat trio. 
</P>
<P>
 The car certainly is no performance monster, not from rest, not when one is 
trying to be innovative in the middle ranges. It certainly never sounds quite 
right. Fuel grime is still visible. 
</P>
<P>
 The essential truth is that if a fan of diesel motoring, this is a vehicle to 
buy as a 10-year purchase. Those with no allegiance to the memory of Rudolf 
Diesel will not be converted. 
</P>
<P>
 Diesel driving is indeed an acquired taste -- rather like bratwurst and dark 
beer. 
</P>
<P>
 "But," Patrone says, "the car doesn't give you as much gas."

BEHIND THE SCENES; CALIFORNIA SPRING STYLES BLOSSOM AT GARDEN SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid the tulips and topiaries, supporters of two charities attended a 
reception last Friday to launch the weekend's Crystal Court Garden Show in 
Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The Junior League of Orange County and New Directions for Women benefited from 
the garden show preview night. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests' attire wasn't as high-styled as that worn by those attending the 
colossal Chelsea Flower Show that opens the social season each spring in 
London, but the crowd of 300 did find ways to cultivate the Southern California 
spring look. 
</P>
<P>
 Women wore long, flowing skirts and cheerful, silk-flowered hats, while men, 
still wearing their stuffy office suits, ripped off their ties to create a 
hybrid look of relaxed professionalism.

INTO THE NIGHT / BILL HIGGINS: CALL IT JUST ANOTHER QUIET EVENING AT THE 
CHATEAU 
</P>

 The Scene: Wednesday's premiere of Gramercy Pictures' "BackBeat" at the 
Hollywood Galaxy Theater. A party followed at the Chateau Marmont hotel.The 
film covers the early, pre-success days of the Beatles in Hamburg. "The movie 
could have been a disaster or a success," co-star Stephen Dorff said. "By not 
thinking so much of the icons, not trying to impersonate the John Lennon or 
Paul McCartney of that time, there's a certain honesty to the film." 
</P>
<P>
 The Locale: The party, which went strong until well after midnight, was held 
in the hotel's lobby and adjoining garden. It's unclear how the hotel guests 
felt about the festivities right outside their windows. But as one party-goer 
mused, "It's not exactly IBM execs who stay here." Another said: "For the 
Chateau Marmont, this is a quiet night." 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: Co-stars Dorff, Ian Hart; writer-director Iain Softley; 
producer Finola Dwyer; plus 700 guests, including Keith Richards, Pia Zadora, 
Reese Witherspoon, Justine Bateman, Tori Spelling, Jennifer Tilly, Richard 
Edson, Billy Wirth, Soleil Moon Frye, Nigel Sinclair, Michael Kuhn and Gramercy 
President Russell Schwartz, who said: "With guests from Keith Richards to Tori 
Spelling, I think we covered the gamut." 
</P>
<P>
 Chow: Buffets from Babylon included falafel, humus, tabbouleh and chicken 
skewers. It was a very Roxbury Club-style, model-laden crowd, which led one 
woman to say: "I haven't eaten anything since I realized I'm the oldest, 
fattest person here." 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: Don Was, who produced the film's soundtrack and brought the Rolling 
Stones' Richards to the film, said: "It was like taking Lee Iacocca to see a 
movie about Fords."

STYLE FILE: USE A LOT OF TLC WHEN REMOVING EYE MAKEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA DeNATALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eyes have been known to captivate. After all, they are the face's focal point, 
something that tells us immediately about a person's persona. For this reason, 
women want to flatter their eyes -- enhance them with the most enticing 
cosmetics. 
</P>
<P>
 But women often sidestep proper eye care, says Joey Marie, an 
esthetician/electrologist of Unique Impressions Skincare and Electrolsis in 
Dana Point. "The eye area suffers the most from dryness and dehydration," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, the skin of the eye area is the thinnest of the entire body and has the 
least oil-producing glands. Consequently, proper eye care protection is 
essential on a daily basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Protection includes knowing how to correctly use makeup remover, she says. 
Here are several of her suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
 * Never let anyone use your eye cosmetics, particularly mascaras. Studies 
indicate that each time a tube is opened, airborne bacteria seeps in. Bacterial 
contamination increases when more than one person uses a product. 
</P>
<P>
 * After opening an eye product 21 times, the product automatically becomes 
contaminated with bacteria. Even if the container is not empty, it should be 
discarded at this time. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use an eye makeup remover that is free of mineral oils or petroleum. These 
can cause deep white bumps that form underneath the sensitive eye area. Also, 
heavy oils or creams that are used to smooth out fine lines underneath the eyes 
can cause puffiness. A light gel that is gently applied around the eyes with 
the ring finger is more effective and will adequately camouflage fine lines. 
</P>
<P>
 * To remove eye makeup, apply remover gel to a cotton ball. Close the eye and 
use gentle downward strokes. Avoid excessive rubbing or pulling. This can cause 
eye irritation, wrinkles or eyelash breakage. 
</P>
<P>
 * Soaps are not recommended. They do not sufficiently remove makeup or surface 
debris and are too harsh for the eye area. They also generally contain perfume, 
artificial colors and sometimes deodorants, which can cause skin irritation and 
severe dryness. 
</P>
<P>
 * Contact lens wearers are especially vulnerable to eye sensitivity caused by 
cosmetics. Don't apply hand cream before inserting lenses or use oils around 
the eyes. Both can leave a film on the lenses. Also, don't use lash-building 
mascaras; the fibers may become trapped in the lenses and cause irritation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Women with contact lens should always use a specially formulated eye makeup 
remover that is fragrance-free and is designed specifically for contact lens 
wearers. BARBARA DeNATALE

 What do you wear to a Sweat-A-Thon? 
</P>
<P>
 Absorbent aerobic wear and a headband, as did many of the 125 exercise 
enthusiasts who participated in a three-hour fitness marathon at Orange Coast 
College in Costa Mesa on Saturday to raise funds for AIDS research and patient 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 The event was part of the City of Hope National Medical Center's annual 
fund-raiser that draws thousands of people to 120 sites around the nation to 
"Workout for Hope" and raise $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Orange Coast College gymnasium, participants labored over back-to-back 
15-minute aerobic programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the mostly female crowd dressed in a practical way to keep cool: 
shorts, tank tops and headbands. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, chose wild, fun outfits: peekaboo leotards, matching printed 
outfits for the layered look, and bikini briefs over bicycle shorts.

 The Look: Loose, cool Chinese pajamas work even better outside the bedroom. As 
street wear, they're the perfect answer to hot-weather dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 Do It Big: Mandarin collars and delicate frog closures on white handkerchief 
linen are the signature details in the Krizia line. The Milan-based design 
house showed vests, jackets and long-sleeved, loose shirts over baggy 
drawstring pants. The shirt costs $465, the pants $380 at Neiman Marcus, 
Beverly Hills. The hat and sunglasses were made exclusively for the designer's 
fashion show. 
</P>
<P>
 Total price: $845 
</P>
<P>
 Do It Budget: The Chinese pajama look can be found in the malls at a variety 
of prices, but Chinatown, near Downtown Los Angeles, has the best deals. Golden 
Dragon Gifts in the ornate shopping square on Ginling Way, off Broadway and 
College Avenue, has an overwhelming assortment. The white rayon brocade set 
here costs $29.99. White and black cotton sets used by karate aficionados go 
for the same price.

 Total amount: $29.99 JOANNA DENDEL

SHRUNKEN SPRING LOOKS GIVE NEW MEANING TO DOWNSIZING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This spring, you can drop a size without losing a pound. Just add a pint-size 
T-shirt, micro-mini kilt, midget midriff sweater and teeny-weeny jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 To do this Lilliputian look, buy the smallest pieces you can squeeze into and 
still look smashing. Consider raiding the boys' departments for Jockey T-shirts 
or heading to Gap Kids. Or downsize with Calvin Klein's white cotton mini tees, 
$15 in the women's department at Neiman Marcus and I. Magnin in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Size up the situation, and you'll find that shrunken tops with fitted sleeves 
are perfect for today's looser, fluid pants. In other words, opposites attract. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why Isaac Mizrahi pairs tiny white tux shirts with oversized black 
"Marx Brothers" dinner jackets, or tiny viscose jersey tank tops with billowy 
taffeta ball skirts. 
</P>
<P>
 The gist is to look as if you outgrew your clothes eons ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But you'd better possess the youth and wit to pull it off. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shrunken silhouettes are very, very trendy, not very practical, and very, 
very young," says Allen Schwartz in Los Angeles, founder of ABS. "I don't 
really relate to them. They're almost like wearing a muscle jacket." 
</P>
<P>
 Littler sizes go best with younger ages, says Barry Goldsmith, Burberry's 
managing director in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market is somebody in her mid- to late-20s or dare I say upward," 
Goldsmith says. "Not everyone who wears them should." 
</P>
<P>
 Burberry's, a 70-year-old company known for conservative plaids, has reprised 
its wool kilt in signature tan, black, white and red windowpane, $430. 
Originally introduced in the late 1960s at 28 inches, it's now available at 15 
1/2 inches -- the shortest ever -- up to 22. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people who buy them are people who know they can wear them," Goldsmith 
says. "They're more your Christy Turlington-type buyer." 
</P>
<P>
 Burberry's isn't the only company offering kid-size kilts. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Tyler, designing for Anne Klein, has them in black leather, $555, and 
multicolored linen, $275, at Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus. Anna Sui 
takes a shine to silver leather, $319 for the mini kilt, with matching battle 
jacket, $484. Sold at Macy's, Bullock's, Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus and 
Anna Sui boutiques in New York and Los Angeles. Sui also does indigo denim, 
$140 at I. Magnin. 
</P>
<P>
 "The junior customer or the advanced customer who is fashion-forward will want 
a kilt, anywhere from 18 to 23 inches," says Hope Brick, fashion director for 
Foley's in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will go after that look in juniors. And for back-to-school it'll be a 
natural. You add opaque tights or thigh-highs and clunky lug-soled shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 Foley's plaid kilts in rayon and wool gabardine by junior labels Star City and 
Tracy Evans are about $44. Both labels will offer short suspender kilts by 
April, $38 to $52. 
</P>
<P>
 Burberry's mini kilt comes with a matching fitted patch-pocket blazer, a far 
cry from the oversized boyfriend jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely tailored, meant to fit, more shaped, more flattering, less 
slouchy, with very thin shoulder pads," Goldsmith says. 
</P>
<P>
 With notch collar, the three-button jacket retails for $655. 
</P>
<P>
 Also designed for the small set is the waist-length battle jacket such as Anna 
Sui's in silver leather with matching kilt, $484 and $319, respectively at 
Macy's, Bullock's, Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus and Anna Sui's stores in New 
York and Los Angeles. Or try a cadet jacket from ABS, in wool gabardine, denim 
or cotton twill, in sand, ivory, navy and white. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an Eisenhower jacket that looks good with long skirts or sailor pants," 
Schwartz says. "And it's small enough to work as a jacket and top at the same 
time. You just button up and you're off." 
</P>
<P>
 The cadet jacket, about $140 to $300 at Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, 
Bloomingdale's, Bergdorf Goodman and Macy's. 
</P>
<P>
 YES Clothing Company, a Los Angeles-based junior sportswear line, offers 
Munchkin-size denim jackets in indigo and black, about $35 in April at Macy's, 
Bloomingdale's, Burdine's, JC Penney and Merry-Go-Round. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're cropped, and there's no padding in the shoulders, so the whole thing 
is really scaled down," says George Randall, head of YES. "The younger girls 
from 15 to 19 love the crop because they have hard tummies." 
</P>
<P>
 At Foley's, tiny tops include Tape Measure's cadet blue short-sleeved crop top 
in cotton and Lycra, $56; Liz Claiborne's linen bolero vest striped in mustard, 
olive and cinnamon, $58; and Adrienne Vittadini's white cotton ribbed tank, 
$130. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't overdose on the itsy-bitsy, Brick says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything really body-conscious does tend to work better on somebody who's 
thin," Brick says, "but it's important to register this new proportion in 
dressing with one piece at a time. If you choose a tiny knit top, don't pair it 
with a tiny jacket. It'll look like proportion overkill."

A NEW DIRECTION; * HARTMUT BITOMSKY, HIGHLY RESPECTED FOR DOCUMENTARY WORK IN 
GERMANY, BRINGS INTERNATIONAL FLAVOR TO CALARTS FILM PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY KAPITANOFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Nancy Kapitanoff writes regularly

<TEXT>
<P>
 The first time Hartmut Bitomsky came to America in 1980, he went to Atlantic 
City, N. J., paid $1,000 for a 1973 Chevy station wagon and drove west to San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 All along the way, Bitomsky, this distinguished documentary filmmaker from 
Germany, accompanied by a film crew of four, stopped and talked to Americans 
from different walks of life. After five months on the road during the year 
when Ronald Reagan was first elected President, he returned to his Berlin home 
to edit his curious encounters with Americans into the three-hour documentary, 
"Highway 40 West." He had been commissioned to make the film for German 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he had never been to the United States before, Bitomsky had become 
familiar with several aspects of its culture at an early age. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a way, belonging to the generation after the war, in Europe, especially in 
Germany, you're in America all the time," Bitomsky, 52, said. "After the war, 
American culture was present first with cinema, then the literature, then the 
music. So it grows on you, the curiosity, since you're always confronted with 
it. It's not your culture; it's not your way of living; but you experience it 
all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 When World War II ended, Bitomsky was a small boy living close to the airport 
in Bremen, which was occupied by the American military. "Immediately after the 
war, they installed a cinema in one of these huge hangars, and every Sunday 
afternoon we kids were invited to see American films. And of course I went," he 
said. "So right from the beginning I've been exposed to American cinema." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he has an opportunity to influence it. Today, Hartmut Bitomsky is the 
dean of the School of Film/Video at California Institute of the Arts. Chosen 
for the job after CalArts conducted a two-year search, he arrived on the 
Valencia campus in October to run a department that encompasses experimental 
film and video, narrative and documentary video production, experimental 
animation and character animation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing we look for in a dean is the artistic quality of his or her 
own work," said CalArts President Steven Lavine. "Hartmut as a filmmaker is as 
major an artist as has ever taught at CalArts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely clear to me that he is a person of imagination and 
stubbornness. Stubbornness is a very important quality in a dean because you 
have to set your mind on what you want to accomplish and then just stick with 
it, whatever the vicissitudes along the way. When you're with Hartmut, you're 
aware that he's in it for the long haul. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beyond that, Hartmut has this broad range of experience. He brings an 
international perspective to the act of filmmaking. He is interested in both 
experimental work and in the best accomplishments of Hollywood and of 
commercial filmmaking. I think he'll bring a breadth of vision to our film 
school, which is very important because the film school itself is very 
diverse." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1962, after high school, Bitomsky moved to Berlin to study theater and 
German literature at the Free University. The Berlin Wall had gone up one year 
earlier. When the German Film and Television Academy opened in Berlin in 1966, 
he enrolled. In 1968, he was one of a group of students who occupied the 
school, renamed it for an old Soviet documentary filmmaker, and got expelled. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972, he became co-editor of the magazine, Filmkritik, for which he wrote 
essays and reviews. About the same time, he established his own production 
company, Big Sky Films, making more than 40 films including shorts, 
documentaries and dramatic features. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the documentaries is a trilogy -- "Images of German Pictures" (1983), 
"Freeway" (1986) and "The VW Complex" (1989) -- that incorporates clips from 
films shot during the Nazi era. The work investigates the history of labor in 
Germany since the 1930s and labor's connection to politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Though his company name sounds much like an homage to America's open spaces, 
the "Sky" actually represents the last syllable of his last name. The "Big" is 
from his wife's name, Brigitte, who is known to friends as Biggie. "And of 
course there's a film called 'Big Sky,' which I love," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 American movies are just one of many influences on his work. Other cinematic 
influences include filmmakers of the French Nouvelle Vague (New Wave) such as 
Jean-Luc Godard, and Italian neo-realist director Michelangelo Antonioni. 
</P>
<P>
 Bitomsky was teaching and making films in Berlin when CalArts gave him a call. 
"When they asked me for the first time if I would be a candidate for this 
position, I said no right away. I'd been rather successful in what I was doing 
over there in Germany, and I could almost regularly make a film once a year, so 
I was doing pretty well. But doing pretty well is tricky, because you are 
satisfied, and I was in a way too secure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suddenly something like this came up, and almost like a thorn in your skin, I 
constantly thought about it. After a while I said, 'Why, that's a big challenge 
which I guess won't be offered again in my lifetime,' and I was pretty sure 
later I wouldn't be able to handle it anymore. In a way, it was the last chance 
to do something very different." 
</P>
<P>
 At CalArts, he heads a department of almost 400 people, 320 of them students. 
"That's a lot of administration, which I have to learn by doing it," he said. 
"I'm still learning. What I've done so far is managing catastrophes." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Jan. 17 earthquake and subsequent aftershocks made it impossible to 
conduct classes on CalArts' Valencia campus, a makeshift film and video school 
has been set up in a vacant Lockheed research center in Rye Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Bitomsky had been through one small jolt in Germany, "but nothing of this 
scale," he said. "This was a real initiation. What we didn't know in the 
beginning was the scenario of it. You see, we were expecting the end of the 
world after the very first shock. We thought, everything is standing, so this 
must be the beginning of it. It will get worse and worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife -- she was scared a lot in the beginning -- she said, 'Let's go back 
to Germany. It's like California is a beautiful fruit from the outside, but in 
there, there's some evil. It's just the whole nature, which has some incredible 
evil depth which is calling for you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 For Bitomsky, it started "to get adventurous," he said. "In a way it 
intensifies your sensations. After a while this goes back to the normal, and 
you start to miss it, this being excited all the time. It's perhaps the same 
when you are making a film. You put so much in it, and when it's finished, 
sometimes it seems there's no purpose anymore for your life because you can't 
start right away with a new project because you're much too exhausted. But you 
miss this kind of excitement and investing all your forces and imagination into 
one focused spot." 
</P>
<P>
 Though no one seeks out catastrophes, the earthquake gave Bitomsky "a big 
chance to take a fast-forward look into the mechanism of this place," he said, 
referring to the whole of CalArts. "A lot of problems came from all directions 
at one time, and you had to be on alert. So many things I wouldn't have 
discovered -- how things were linked to each other in the school. Nobody would 
tell me, since for everybody else, it was the normal way. So in a way I was 
benefiting from it." 
</P>
<P>
 There are some benefits in the temporary campus as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "My school had been dispersed all over the old campus. For the very first 
time, we are almost under one roof," he said. "I think a couple of students 
have seen their dean for the very first time. So a very good atmosphere of 
belonging together has been created by that." 
</P>
<P>
 And the earthquake has served as a catalyst for future improvements. "We have 
had three different computer labs belonging to different departments of the 
school," Bitomsky said. In the Lockheed facility, they had to put two of them 
together. "To make it short, I could convince all my program heads -- who had 
territorial considerations -- I could convince them for the future to form one 
big, very efficient computer lab making better use of our resources. This could 
happen only because we were here." 
</P>
<P>
 Bitomsky likened his school to a "huge tanker, and it takes time to give it 
just a slight new direction." 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't say, 'Here's the master plan, now everybody has to fit into it.' 
I've seen a lot of people running film schools, coming there and trying to 
design everything. They failed because you deal with people, with structures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I rather see myself as somebody who's digging out the talents which are there 
and giving them a certain direction. But that is more or less of a 
philosophical kind -- how to handle things, reflect on them -- than to set a 
completely different set of goals for the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
 This semester, he is teaching a documentary class. He plans to teach "where I 
feel there is something missing," he said. "I teach a documentary class since 
there is nobody else who is teaching this area. And I think although students 
might not be interested personally in this area, it's still a healthy 
experience. Knowing something about documentary film could be something they 
will benefit from when they are making their own films. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I like teaching. I'll do it not only to escape from the administrative 
work, but because teaching is interesting. You always have to re-evaluate your 
position. Sometimes you meet some very old questions, which come up all the 
time, and every time there's something different to the question of students, 
and so it vivifies your own system of thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 He also sees potential for development in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of filmmaking here is strictly experimental, and experimental and 
narrative filmmaking seem to be in opposition. I'm astonished about that 
because there are a lot of highly advanced ways of telling stories," he said. 
"The 20th Century is full of writers who worked on different ways of telling 
stories and tried to reveal all the potential which is in narrative 
storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
 "But in cinema, it's still 19th Century concerning stories, always the same 
kind of structure. I think we can try to push narrative filmmaking in a 
different direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I would like to give back is the knowledge that we could do much more 
with our tools, with our means of expression. The range of what our tools 
permit us to do is much wider than the actual use of them."

HE HASN'T MISSED A BEAT; * DON RANDI HAS BEEN PLAYING THE PIANO AT HIS OWN 
CLUB, UNCOVERING TALENT AND KEEPING UP WITH THE MUSIC FOR 24 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pianist Don Randi has the honor of holding down what has to be the 
longest-running jazz job in Southern California: 24 years of performances at 
least once a week at the Baked Potato. And he doesn't have to worry about 
losing his gig -- he owns the joint. 
</P>
<P>
 The cozy, if not comfy, Baked Potato, a box of a nightclub on Cahuenga 
Boulevard just west of Lankershim, was first a refuge, then became a bastion, 
for contemporary jazz. That's what it's called when mainstream jazz is peppered 
with influences primarily from rock but also from blues, R & B and other styles 
of music. 
</P>
<P>
 Randi, a native of New York, was perhaps the first jazzman to play the 
contemporary mode, when, in 1966, he and his cohorts put out "Rubber Soul 
Jazz," covering the Beatles' smash 1965 album "Rubber Soul." 
</P>
<P>
 "We just approached the album like jazz players, except that we used the rock 
rhythms and played jazz lines on top of them," Randi remembers. 
</P>
<P>
 The contemporary style suited him, since he'd started out as a blues-based 
pianist, working Sunset Strip-area clubs such as the Losers, the Winners, the 
Capri and the Encore in the late '50s and early '60s. And he still employs it 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always tried to move with what's current," says Randi, a resident of 
Agoura, who leads his quintet, Quest, most Thursdays through Saturdays at the 
original Baked Potato. (There's a second Baked Potato now in Pasadena, co-owned 
by Randi and Bob and Gino Vella.) "Latin, rock, funk-type, I've always played 
those tunes." 
</P>
<P>
 In the '50s and '60s, Randi made a substantial living as a studio pianist, 
often working with renowned producer Phil Spector. He's featured on hundreds of 
pop tunes, among them the Beach Boys' "Good Vibrations," The Crystals' "He's a 
Rebel," the Righteous Brothers' "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'," Ike and Tina 
Turner's "River Deep -- Mountain High" and the Ronettes' "Be My Baby." His 
performances, as well as an interview and photo, are included in Spector's 
"Back to Mono," a 4-CD set on ABCO Records. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Randi doesn't do much studio work, which is fine by him. "I've 
accepted it, and besides, I get a lot of reuse checks from sessions I did years 
ago," when a song is used on a current film or TV show. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in his halcyon period, Randi looked forward to getting out of the studio 
and into a club. "I love playing so much," he says. "Performing for an audience 
has always been more important to me. I particularly like playing for young 
kids. They're very inquisitive." 
</P>
<P>
 His upbeat attitude toward youth goes farther. He supports young artists by 
hiring them at his establishments. "I don't have a big ego, and I love to be 
part of somebody new," he says. "In the '70s, there were Tom Scott, Larry 
Carlton, Lee Ritenour, Seawind. They all started at the Baked Potato. Now we 
have Cecilia Noel and the Wild Clams," a 14-piece band that appears Mondays at 
the club and recently signed with Epic. "And there's Robbie Longley. He's a 
guitarist with a New Orleans feel. I love to watch him play." 
</P>
<P>
 The open-eared policy demonstrated by Randi and his late partner, Sheldon 
Slusman, who managed the Baked Potato for two decades before succumbing to 
cancer, has influenced other clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 If there's one thing Randi stands for, it's having music reach people, no 
matter what style it is. "When everybody hated someone like Ornette Coleman," 
the adventurous saxophonist who arrived on the jazz scene in the late '50s, "I 
said, 'Why not? It's music, and this guy is going where no one else is going,' 
" Randi says. "A lot of people have put down Kenny G. Though I don't like all 
of his stuff, he's sold to an audience that a lot of jazz has never reached. He 
broke through, and there's nothing wrong with that. It's wonderful." WHERE AND 
WHEN

TAKING OFF THE BLINDERS; * IN 'THE POLITICS OF FAIRY TALES,' DIRECTOR STEPHEN 
MOORE USES THREE ONE-ACTS TO SHOW THE DUPLICITY OF FABLES AND NEED TO SEE 
BEYOND 'ROSE-COLORED GLASSES.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Parents and teachers don't always tell kids the truth. The favorite stories of 
childhood are not always what they seem. That fact is part of the message of 
juxtaposi tion of three one-acts in "The Politics of Fairy Tales," now playing 
at NoHo Studios. 
</P>
<P>
 Think about what are considered kiddie yarns. "Gulliver's Travels" is an 
intricate political satire of Jonathan Swift's era. "Huckleberry Finn" is a 
serious adult novel dealing to a great extent with race relations and slavery. 
Even nursery rhymes are based on social and political mores. Jack and Jill were 
being punished for adultery in the manner of their day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politics of Fairy Tales" director Stephen Moore has always been intrigued by 
what he calls in a press release "the duplicity of fairy tales." That's why he 
decided to produce and stage Dennis E. Noble's political satire "A Game" as the 
evening's centerpiece, and to press home his point with modern glances at the 
fairy tale genre. "A Game" details an experiment in which three people are each 
given a separate part of a room as their own, and instructions to recite a 
slogan: "This is my land. It is mine." The lesson is clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore explains, "It's about the dangers of excessive nationalism, in that if 
we're all taught to be excessively nationalistic, and say, 'This property is 
mine, and ain't nobody else getting on it, and nobody else touching it,' we run 
into a lot of problems. We're taught by the government, or somebody, to be very 
nationalistic, whether it's about our own neighborhood, or our own demographic 
group, or our own country. We tend to get ourselves into quite a bit of trouble 
by doing that. It's going on in Bosnia right now." 
</P>
<P>
 As the people in the "Game" are put in boxes, Moore feels that governments 
also try to put people in boxes. Nationalism, he says, is "very fairy tale-ish, 
in that we'd rather have blinders slapped on and told to rah-rah-rah for our 
group, and not see what it actually takes to get to be nationally superior. 
Never mind that that demographic group, or that country, has to be trod 
underfoot. Wear those blinders, those rose-colored glasses, and everything will 
be fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore discovered "Game" about 10 years ago and last directed it in 1991 in 
Baltimore. He says that the modern setting of the Noble work is a departure 
from the first two plays in the evening. The first play is Jean Anouilh's 
"Augustus," written with Jean Aurenche, about a young man who is able to say 
only one word each day. He is different from everyone else, and like the 
characters in "Game," is forced into another kind of box. In A.A. Milne's 
adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen's "The Ugly Duckling," this time about 
humans instead of birds, the plainness of the Princess puts her, romantically 
and socially, in yet another box. 
</P>
<P>
 "The audience will be surprised," Moore goes on, "maybe taken aback, at how it 
all fits together. The 'ugly duckling' is a very real subject. It has become a 
catch-phrase in our society for people who are made to feel by their parents, 
by their authority figures, to feel less attractive than they are." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It follows that stereotypes are ugly ducklings. The fairy tales suddenly start 
to get more serious in Moore's view. 
</P>
<P>
 They also get serious with his actors. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith Forte, who plays the Prince in "Duckling" and the Doctor in "Game," can 
be seen this fall as the lead in the upcoming feature film "No Ordinary Love." 
</P>
<P>
 "What I like about the plays," Forte says, "is what ties them together, what 
makes them adult. They are childhood fairy tales, but the entire through-line 
of the show makes it adult when you cap it off with 'A Game.' It's very evident 
in all the action that takes place that these are very adult themes." 
</P>
<P>

 Forte laughs when he admits that even with the adult themes, children would 
probably get the points being made quicker than their seniors, because they're 
not carrying all that adult baggage to confuse issues.

 Kitty McNamee was last seen on stage in Hollywood in the Tiffany Theatre 
production of "The Killing of Michael Malloy." She plays the Princess in "Ugly 
Duckling" and Augustus' love in the Anouilh play.

<P>
 "The fun of doing these roles," she explains, "is that I can let go of 
everything and simply do them. If I try to bring anything extraneous to it, it 
won't work. It's just very simple. I have to let go of a lot of baloney. Part 
of it is that the plays are very well written. It has to do with the archetypal 
images that are brought out in the plays. And the themes are so familiar to all 
of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Emotional adult baggage, baloney, blinders. They're what Moore is trying to 
find in his examination of these simple stories. "That's what fairy tales are," 
he says. "They are really rose-colored glasses. WHERE AND WHEN

A DARKNESS BENEATH; * DIRECTOR MICHAEL WINTERS SAYS IT'S 'THE ANOMALIES' HE 
LIKES IN SHAKESPEARE'S 'ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL.' 
</P>

<P>
 Don't tell Michael Winters that "All's Well That Ends Well" is one of 
Shakespeare's lesser works. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an odd, quirky play," allows the director, whose staging is playing at A 
Noise Within. "Certainly it's a comedy in name only, mostly because no one dies 
at the end. But it's a very sad story. It doesn't end happily -- unreservedly 
happily. I was also attracted because so many people don't do it. They say 
Shakespeare was lazy with it, that it's too much of a fairy tale, that someone 
else wrote it -- or parts of it. It's often dismissed out of hand. Well, I 
don't think it's entirely successful, but it's not dismissible." 
</P>
<P>
 The 22-character play, which is considered to be one of the last of 
Shakespeare's canon to be written, concerns a young nobleman, Bertram, whose 
father has just died; he's now been made a ward of the king. When a young 
servant girl, Helena, falls in love with Bertram and makes a deal with the king 
for Bertram's hand, the young man refuses. After he is forced to marry, Bertram 
runs away -- and Helena pursues him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most comedies end with the wedding," Winters points out. "Here, it's in the 
middle. It's not the end, but the beginning of the second movement." 
</P>
<P>
 A Noise Within company member Ann Marie Lee plays the determined Helena, a 
character investigation, she says, "that's turned into a love affair." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a great strength in her that I admire," says the actress, who played 
Ann in Shaw's "Man and Superman" at the theater last spring. "Strong but 
incredibly vulnerable -- and fallible. She makes her choices, and you wonder if 
they're right. Of course, as an actress playing her, I think they're absolutely 
right!" 
</P>
<P>
 Lee also sees a contemporary tone in the miracle-cure aspect of the play: 
"People today are really looking within -- or to some spirituality -- for 
strength, a miracle in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Winters, 50, is not a member of the company, but has acted with many of the 
group's members in past regional work. Born in Virginia, he grew up outside 
Cleveland and studied drama at Northwestern University. After a stint in the 
military, Winters spent time in San Francisco (at the American Conservatory 
Theatre), Santa Maria, Calif., Denver and Seattle, where he made his home 5 1/2 
years ago. For the past two years, he has shuttled between Seattle and Los 
Angeles, where he reprised his role in Robert Schenkkan's "The Kentucky Cycle" 
at the Mark Taper Forum in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, Winters returns to Seattle, where he will appear onstage in Jim 
Leonard's "Gray's Anatomy" and, later this season, in Alan Ayckbourn's "Man of 
the Moment." 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't directed for quite awhile," he acknowledges of his current detour. 
"But I did direct a student production of 'All's Well' 12 years ago at ACT, and 
I appeared in it eight or 10 years ago. It's the anomalies of this play that I 
like. Nothing is black and white; there's a lot of darkness under the surface. 
I'd much rather do this than the 18th (revival of) 'Twelfth Night.' " WHERE AND

LOOKING FOR FAIR OPTIONS; HEALTH SCREENINGS CAN BE A COST-EFFECTIVE WAY TO KEEP 
TABS ON PHYSICAL CONDITION, BUT CAN'T TAKE THE PLACE OF PERSONALIZED CARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 If you are curious about your cholesterol, worried about your blood pressure 
or bothered by bunions -- but dread spending the better part of the morning 
(not to mention your paycheck) in a doctor's office, there may be an easier -- 
and cheaper -- way. 
</P>
<P>
 You can get a variety of basic medical exams, advice and information for free 
or at low prices at health fairs, offered by hospitals and community 
organizations throughout the San Fernando Valley area. 
</P>
<P>
 Health fairs include head-to-toe basic screenings -- from vision checks to 
foot exams. You can find out if you are at risk for prostate cancer, learn how 
to do a breast self-exam or discover if your cholesterol is under control. You 
can get weighed and measured, rate your lifestyle according to its health 
quotient or have your children immunized and fingerprinted. You can pick up 
information on whatever interests you, join a support group for whatever 
worries you or be referred to a physician who specializes in whatever ails you. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother of all health screenings is the annual Health Fair Expo, held today 
through April 24 at hospitals, shopping malls and community agencies throughout 
Southern California. Sponsored by the American Red Cross and various 
organizations and hospitals, Health Fair Expo has served more than a million 
people in its 17-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 Height, weight and vision exams, as well as health displays, AIDS education 
and an assortment of screenings and services, are provided at all Health Fair 
Expo locations. Everything is free, except for prostate, cholesterol and other 
tests requiring lab work, which are usually available for about $20 to $25 
each. People who have abnormal test results will be asked to see their own 
doctor or referred to a physician. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can get a lot of things tested for very little cost -- and it is more fun 
to be checked at a fair than a physician's office," said Dr. Martin Smietanka, 
a Burbank family practice physician who regularly volunteers for Health Fair 
Expo. "Health fairs are focused on promoting health and preventing or catching 
diseases in their early stages. People enjoy them, they have a good time, and 
they learn a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 But in no way do health fair screenings substitute for personalized medical 
care, Smietanka said. "Health fairs are not the place to go if you have 
specific symptoms, such as chest or stomach pains or shortness of breath. You 
need to see a physician." 
</P>
<P>
 Fair-goers should also be aware that the hospitals' motives for throwing such 
events are not solely altruistic. The fairs are good advertising for the 
sponsoring facilities -- and they bring in patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "Health fairs identify people who have a life-threatening diagnosis -- and 
that, of course, leads to a hospital admission," said David Langness, vice 
president of communications for the Hospital Council of Southern California. 
"But the fairs do not pay for themselves by any means. Out of 1,000 people, 
maybe one will need treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 Hospitals typically spend thousands of dollars in labor, publicity, supplies 
and handouts for a single health fair, said Sue Wyninegar, director of 
marketing at St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank. "Some hospitals have dropped 
out of offering health fairs because they are not the most productive things in 
the world. You don't get a lot of business from them." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Wyninegar, nonprofit facilities sponsor the events as a community 
service -- and also as a way to prove their "social accountability," required 
to maintain tax-exempt status. "Part of our mission is to provide education and 
preventive care, and health fairs are a good way to do that," she said. "Plus 
they create top-of-mind awareness of the hospital. They get a lot of people 
into the medical center, and if they have a good experience, they will want to 
come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Health fair exams are certainly more pleasant and less of a hassle than a trip 
to the doctor's office, but they may not save a lot of money for people with 
adequate health insurance. A doctor's visit, including lab work, may cost just 
$5 or $10 through many HMOs. If your health plan pays 80% of health services, 
your out-of-pocket expenses at the doctor's office may be no more than what you 
would fork over at a health fair for a cholesterol check. 
</P>
<P>
 "Health fairs are helpful in that they offer screenings and information in 
less intimidating circumstances than a doctor's office," said Dr. Adelaide 
Randak, a Woodland Hills family practice physician. "But the flip side is that 
the information people receive may be inadequate. Health fairs are not set up 
to really question or interview patients, and the personnel administering the 
tests may not be qualified to interpret the results." 
</P>
<P>
 Randak believes that the best tests to seek at health fairs are those that 
yield uniformly accurate results, such as blood pressure, blood sugar, 
cholesterol, anemia and blood panels. "Assuming a good lab is used, those are 
all well-established tests that reliably indicate whether the patient needs 
follow-up or not," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Randak added that blood tests must be performed on an empty stomach; 
otherwise, the results will be skewed. "If you just had a taco and snow cone, 
your cholesterol and blood sugar tests will be wildly inaccurate," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One also should not expect individualized, in-depth care at health fairs, 
according to Dr. Martin Gelbard, a Burbank urologist. "In health fair 
situations you really don't have any time to discuss symptoms. You don't have 
an opportunity for detailed questions and answers. You don't get the patient's 
history that gives information you need. And that doctor-patient interaction -- 
not just a bunch of blood tests that you get from assembly-line screening 
programs -- is one of the most important factors in identifying a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 As a consequence, fair-goers may be unnecessarily alarmed when nothing is 
wrong -- or even worse, incorrectly reassured when there really is a problem. 
"Someone may have a slightly abnormal test -- but not cancer," Gelbard said. 
"And a small percentage of men who have (prostate) cancer may have a normal 
blood test." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their limitations, health fairs can be lifesavers. Smietanka remembers 
a fit, healthy-looking, 65-year-old fellow with no symptoms of illness. The man 
attended last year's Health Fair Expo on a whim, took part in a few screenings 
-- and learned that he had colon and prostate cancer. "Both cancers were caught 
in time, and he is still doing well," Smietanka said. Mark Your Calendar

THREE-RING FUN; * A CHILDREN'S THEATER PRODUCTION RELIES ON ACTORS AND A BIT OF 
IMAGINATION TO BRING THRILLS OF THE CIRCUS TO LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEATHER W. MORGAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Heather W. Morgan is a regular 
contributor to The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carol Allen wasn't sure how to respond when her 4- and 5-year-old boys asked 
if they would see real lions and tigers and bears at "The Circus Is Coming to 
Town," a children's production at the Storybook Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what to tell them, since we've been to birthday parties where 
ponies and farm animals are brought in to create instant petting zoos and 
rides. I guess almost anything is possible," said Allen, who lives in the 
Hollywood Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you know what? This was better," she said. "The show relied on pure 
imagination. And you cannot get much better than that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little nervous about what the show would be like since this was our 
first experience at children's theater and it wasn't a traditional fairy tale," 
Allen said. "But several friends had recommended it. They said, 'You can always 
count on Storybook Theatre.' " 
</P>
<P>
 With eight years under its belt and a mailing list that exceeds 2,000 
families, Storybook Theatre has earned the reputation among parents for 
producing positive children's theater. Everything from the props and costumes 
right down to the character of the villains is executed with a certain 
gentleness -- and silliness.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've been told that our plays remind people of me," said Barbara Mallory 
Schwartz, the creator of Storybook Theatre, who co-directs shows with her 
husband, Lloyd Schwartz, who writes the shows. "I'm kind of a primary color 
person. I like bold and happy feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "And besides, you really have to be careful when you're dealing with young 
children. They may be somewhat more sophisticated these days, but our audiences 
still only range from 3 to 8 years old," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And just like its creator, "The Circus Is Coming to Town" is a bold and happy 
show with an "I-can-do-anything" mentality. Its real emphasis is that kids can 
create anything, even a circus, with just a little imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Storybook also performs such traditional tales as "Hansel and Gretel," 
"Sleeping Beauty" and "Little Red Riding Hood" (with some minor variations on 
the standard themes), but staging original works is an exciting challenge, 
Schwartz said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun to create and work with other subjects besides the ones that 
everyone already knows," she said, adding that she often gets ideas for shows 
or themes from her sons, who are 4 and 12 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to keep things simple. The music is simple, even the dance steps are 
simple. I like songs that involve repetition so that kids can easily hum or 
sing them," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 And in "Circus," just like in almost every other Storybook production, the 
audience can count on at least one good chase scene up and down the aisles. 
"Kids love it," Schwartz said. "It really helps to keep a physicality about the 
show when you're dealing with young children." 
</P>
<P>
 And participation? Well, it's really the kids that end up making the circus 
acts, from juggling and tumbling across the stage to imagined tightrope walking 
and lion taming.

THE FINE PRINTS; * LILY YU EXPLORES THE SELF AND DIANE MCBRIDE THE EARTH IN A 
SHOW AT NEW CANYON GALLERY IN TOPANGA.

<P>
 The mystery and magic of the printmaking process have lured some artists into 
giving up painting and drawing. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane McBride of Woodland Hills discov ered the alchemy in printmaking 20 
years ago, finishing a master's degree at State University of New York at 
Stonybrook. 
</P>
<P>
 "Working in the studio, pulling a print off this plate, I was pinned by an 
electric jolt to that press," she said, speaking figuratively. "I'd struggled 
with painting. It wasn't quite right. I love metal, and I love line. I love the 
acids, the chemistry of printmaking -- the interplay of the chemicals, the 
plate, your own skill and knowledge of chemistry, time and your own hand. Your 
idea is constantly being challenged by the chemical process of printmaking." 
</P>
<P>
 West Los Angeles artist Lily Yu, who is pursuing a bachelor's degree in studio 
art at Cal State Long Beach, took up printmaking a year ago. She had been 
drawing and painting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really an experiment," she said. "You have this plate, the starting 
point. I love that moment where you peel off the paper from the plate and you 
peek at it, and the print is born. It is that magic moment. No matter how hard 
you try, each one is different because it's a hand process. I love the idea of 
variation and possibility."  
</P>
<P>
 McBride and Yu's separate but complementary printmaking explorations of life 
below the surface can be seen at New Canyon Gallery in Topanga. The show is 
titled "Above and Below, Explorations of Self and Earth -- Intaglio Etchings 
and Relief Prints." 
</P>
<P>
 Yu employs various printmaking processes -- woodcut, linoleum cut, aquatint 
etching, drypoint -- in her series of self-portraits, which reveal her 
"innermost fears and insecurities," she said. Though these prints delve into 
her psyche, "I feel with all my work I am speaking about women. In 'Liberation 
of Dollface,' I'm liberating myself and all women." 
</P>
<P>
 This linoleum-cut print depicts a Yu of strong body and mind. Holding 
marionette-like strings that have been cut, she forthrightly faces the viewer, 
a bit of bravado in her stance. 
</P>
<P>
 "This piece has become more and more dear to me. I am more and more embodying 
the spirit of it. This image gives me courage," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among her visions of self is the sculpture "Moving the Mechanical Dance." Made 
from prints and "bits and pieces from my home," she said, including chair-leg 
wheels and pieces of wood, this rendering from the waist down is almost all 
legs. It stands awkwardly on a small table, near a dance-step diagram.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's about movement and balance, about recognizing the rules and trying to 
break away from them," Yu said. Bothered by the fact that a print is only flat 
-- "in the end, it's just a piece of paper" -- Yu has incorporated prints into 
this three-dimensional work in an effort to "push printmaking past its 
conventional form." 
</P>
<P>
 McBride has chosen to break barriers in the content of her prints rather than 
in the printmaking process. "The image always has to be a little more important 
than the process," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the "very challenging" intaglio etching process, her imaginatively 
detailed views of life above and especially below the surface of the earth are 
"celebrations of the natural world," she said. "My work is very connected with 
people within the land. The confrontation of the human situation and the 
natural world fascinates me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wherever two edges meet, there's energy, and that's what interests me. Most 
of my work is done at the edge of humans peeking into the natural world. I love 
the layers of the earth, and I'm trying to image what might be under there." 
</P>
<P>
 "Chrystie Street" in New York City conveys a sense of what we see above 
ground, and the "eons of life forms, plants and animals that lie underneath," 
McBride said. For "Delancey Street," she took the plate and etching tool to the 
Lower East Side and created her first line drawing there.  
</P>
<P>
 Within the layers of earth that she creates through her fine lines, one finds 
various bird, animal and human forms, especially if one looks closely at each 
print. Sandhill cranes inhabit her "Inland Sea." Coyotes roam "Mojave," her 
attempt "to learn the language of the desert," she said. "In the desert, you 
see the bones, the structure of the earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each print is another question. I look for the answer in a subsequent print. 
Both Lily and I are searching. We're constantly amazed by the visual world. The 
work is an attempt to find out what it's about." WHERE AND WHEN

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: FOREST OF SAVINGS; * PHIL LEE NURSERIES IN MOORPARK IS 
MOVING ITS TREE FARM AND OFFERING BIG DISCOUNTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's a bargain-shopping trek to make on an especially sweet spring day. 
Trees at Phil Lee Nurseries in Moorpark have been dramatically discounted 
because the nursery is moving its tree farm from the 50 acres it is now leasing 
to land it recently purchased.  
</P>
<P>
 The owners would rather sell the trees than move them, so until they are out 
of trees, the sale is on. Trees in what they call 24-inch boxes (two-foot 
squares) are selling for $40 apiece although they go for $100 to $250 at retail 
nurseries around town. Trees in 36-inch boxes, which often retail for $400 to 
$700, are $175. 
</P>
<P>
 General manager Maureen Shea gave us a fast tour through the hilly tree 
forests. (Customers are driven to and from this massive area.) During the ride, 
she pointed out a row of about 100 stately Italian cypress trees, 18 to 20 feet 
tall; one man paid $99.95 apiece -- Lee's regular price -- for all of them. At 
several nurseries in town, similar-size Italian cypress trees are $200 to $250 
each. 
</P>
<P>
 In the $40 grouping of sale trees, you'll find crape myrtle, juniper, 
jacaranda, sycamore, California pepper, poplar, pear, olive, bottlebrush and 
birch, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all the trees were full and shapely, bug-free and obviously healthy. A 
dazzling array of colors was added by the blooming trees (plum, pear and potato 
vine).  
</P>
<P>
 The trees are marked so the shopper can note the name, number and location. 
The delivery charge is $10 to $25 per tree (depending on the size) with a $35 
minimum for the smaller $40 trees and $50 each for the larger $175 trees. If 
you plan to transport them yourself, Shea needs to be notified in advance so 
she can make sure she has enough help to move and load them. 
</P>
<P>
 A nice selection of roses, azaleas and smaller shrubs are not part of the 
sale, but the prices are excellent. WHERE TO SHOP 
</P>
<P>
 What: Tree sale at Phil Lee Nurseries. 
</P>
<P>
 Location: 6005 Grimes Canyon Road, Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Directions: Take Ventura Freeway west to the Moorpark Freeway; go north, exit 
at New Los Angeles Avenue. Head west on New Los Angeles, turn right on Grimes 
Canyon Road. Turn left at Phil Lee Nurseries sign. Follow road to entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday to Saturday, 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Sunday.

THROWING MY WEIGHT AROUND; * AN UNWARLIKE WOMAN IS TRANSFORMED INTO A 
BLOODTHIRSTY BLIMP TO SHOW WHO'S THE BOSS IN THE SUMO RING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Even though I'm hardly the aggressive type, I couldn't wait to wrestle 
complete strangers till their butts hit the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 What inspired me to new lows? It's all part of something called sumo basho. 
Invented by the Miller Brewing Co., the sport is a modified sumo wrestling 
experience for laymen and, er, women. In Japan, the wrestlers beef up (mostly 
on pricey Kobe steak) to their personal maximum (around 400 to 500 pounds) and 
train in an honorable tradition dating back thousands of years. 
</P>
<P>
 I took a shortcut. Though a Miller beer belly probably wouldn't hurt, it isn't 
required for sumo basho because special "suits" insulated with layers of 
padding protect and inflate average Joes and Janes who want to give it a go. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, basho matches are staged at Bobby McGee's in Burbank. Anyone game 
enough to try it can not only do so for free, but they can compete for in-house 
coupons and dinners. I tell friends what I'm up to, and their advisories are 
varied. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take plenty of Advil." 
</P>
<P>
 "How many beers will you down before you do it?" 
</P>
<P>
 "What time should I be there?" 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, having supporters to cheer you on -- and possibly drive you to the 
hospital (just kidding) -- makes for a more convivial creaming of your 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 When I arrive, husband in tow, I check in with the disc jockey, who promptly 
hands me a waiver absolving Miller of all liability should I be injured. Immune 
to liability jargon since I am married to a lawyer, I simply ask if anyone's 
ever gotten hurt. He says no, so I sign and wait for him to call me. 
</P>
<P>
 The waiver unnerves me a teensy bit, so I sip a beer. Employees lay padded 
mats on the wooden dance floor. Then they bring out the suits, bronze vinyl 
numbers that cover layers of foam with amusing visual enhancements like 
Fabio-esque pectorals and an attached thong-style belt, complete with Lite beer 
logo, similar in style to the belts authentic -- and mostly naked -- sumo 
wrestlers wear. 
</P>
<P>
 At Bobby McGee's, the whole thing is G-rated, not G-stringy. The suits, 
available in only a few hundred bars around the country, cost about $1,000 
each. (Only the kid in "Blank Check" could afford one of his own.) Personally, 
I'd rather have an Armani suit. I wonder if the irony of the Lite beer on the 
gigantic sumo belt is lost on everyone but me as I prepare to visually gain 
about 300 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally they call my name, and I head down to the mats in my stocking feet. My 
"coach" (the guy who helps me up when I inevitably belly-flop) tells me to lie 
on my stomach and climb into the suit, feet first. Initially, I get both legs 
stuck in one sumo leg and struggle to pull them out. I re-enter and succeed, 
then slip my arms into the suit's cavernous sleeves. The legs are so bulky my 
feet cannot touch the ground, so I feel like a bloated rolling pin. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach adheres the Velcro strips on the back of the suit and hoists me up. He 
slips on some padded mitts and a football helmet covered with lacquered hair 
made to look like a Japanese wig. First I had no neck, now I can hardly see. 
Friends and spouse are laughing hysterically as they gawk at me. I can't dwell 
on how funny I look, though -- I came to win! 
</P>
<P>
 I can barely bend my elbows and knees but Coach tells me not to worry. He says 
I can win easily if I use the force of my belly to slam my opponent and simply 
step out of the way if she comes at me. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds easy enough. My opponent is a petite, demure Generation X-er. I've been 
psyching myself up for this for days, but she seems to have been coerced at the 
last minute by friends. Anyway, this boomer is ready to kick her butt, as Tonya 
Harding would say. 
</P>
<P>
 The club's disc jockey, the basho emcee, explains the point system and lays 
down the rules, like no hitting above the shoulders. Good thing, too -- I don't 
want my mascara smeared.  
</P>
<P>
 The first time I bash the X-er, she falls flat on her face. I'm kind of 
worried -- is she all right? -- but the bloodthirsty crowd shouts, "Body slam!" 
That means I'm supposed to throw my padded belly onto hers -- on purpose! I 
worry about hurling my own poundage onto her tiny frame, but the crowd demands 
aggression. Tossing etiquette and concern for my fellow woman aside, I wallop 
her, and the crowd roars. Our coaches pick us up, and we regroup for Round 2. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, my adrenaline is rushing, and my husband and friends are nearly 
collapsed with laughter. Though my opponent gets me good a couple of times, I 
fall but once. I bash her twice more and win. 
</P>
<P>
 Victorious, I climb out of the suit, perspiring slightly, but thrilled with 
the experience. X-er temporarily loses an earring, which is promptly recovered. 
My moment of glory is over far too soon but I revel in the thrill of it.  
</P>
<P>
 I would basho again in a heartbeat. But I will remember a few key ingredients 
for a truly successful evening: 
</P>
<P>
 * Wear flexible, lightweight clothing if you want to wrestle. 
</P>
<P>
 * Skip jewelry, or take it off before a match. Bring plenty of friends to 
cheer you on -- or possibly take you on. Friends who bash each other seem to 
get more out of the experience. 
</P>
<P>
 * Most of all, make sure you talk a buddy into doing it so you can watch. My 
pals and hubby say it's twice as funny to watch a friend basho than it is to 
watch a complete stranger. They should know. 
</P>
<P>
 After seeing pictures of myself, only now can I appreciate how ridiculous I 
looked. One is a possible Christmas card, another a keeper for the fridge and a 
sure-fire diet incentive if there ever was one. WHERE AND WHEN  
</P>
<P>
 What: Sumo basho at Bobby McGee's, 107 S. 1st St., Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: Tuesdays and Sundays. Sign-ups begin at 8 p.m., but the action doesn't 
usually start until about 9.

HOUSE OF TREASURE; * THE HUNTINGTON LIBRARY, ART COLLECTIONS AND BOTANICAL 
GARDENS OFFER MORE THAN CAN BE SEEN IN AN AFTERNOON VISIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Huntington is one of those fabulous places that illustrate both the 
glories and limits of acquisition. The legendary library, art collections and 
botanical gardens in San Marino were once the private playground of one of 
America's wealthiest men -- Henry E. Huntington -- who inherited millions and 
amassed a fortune of his own as head of the Southern Pacific Railroad and 
Pacific Electric and as a speculator in real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 A multimillionaire in an age with little to fear from the tax collector, 
Huntington had an educated sensibility and the money to indulge it. A heroic 
spender, in historian Kevin Starr's apt phrase, Huntington bought himself a 
garden worthy of King Solomon and kept Sotheby's smiling with his purchase of a 
Gutenberg Bible and other literary treasures. His wife, Arabella, couldn't 
stand Southern California -- she would rather have been in Paris, thank you -- 
but eased the pain of living in a cultural wasteland with judicious imports, 
including a mansion full of 18th-Century British paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 Time, as it inevitably does, eventually separated the Huntingtons from their 
treasures (she died in 1924, he in 1927). But in death the Huntingtons 
practiced a kind of heroic generosity, opening their refined pleasure palace to 
the polyglot people who had underwritten their lifestyle with muscle and blood. 
The estate and its collections were transferred to a nonprofit educational 
trust. As one of the terms, Huntington insisted that the institution be open to 
the public free of charge, as it has been since 1928. If your timing is right, 
and no other gawkers are around, you can almost imagine yourself in Arabella's 
costly shoes, nibbling the extravagant delicacy of your choice under the gaze 
of Gainsborough's "Blue Boy." Today the Huntington suggests that visitors make 
a $5 donation ($3 for children). It's strictly voluntary and a small price to 
pay to experience the subtle beauty of the Japanese garden, to contemplate the 
mystery of how movable type revolutionized the world and to play the plutocrat, 
if only for an afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Know at the outset that you can't do justice to the Huntington in three hours. 
The gardens alone cover 130 acres and could keep you intrigued for a lifetime. 
With that caveat in mind, slather on the sunscreen and lace up your walking 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 1 p.m.: The rich are different from you and me. They have better gardens. The 
Huntingtons transformed a working ranch, covered with the sparse vegetation 
typical of the San Gabriel Valley, into a personal Eden -- perhaps the finest 
private garden in America. In fact, the Huntington has 15 distinct garden 
areas, featuring more than 14,000 different types of plants. Every day at 1 
p.m., a docent leads visitors through this botanical Disneyland, which changes 
with each of Southern California's subtle seasons. Depending on demand and the 
number of docents available, additional garden tours may be scheduled 
throughout the afternoon. You can find out by consulting the sign at the rear 
of the information pavilion. Plan on an hour and a half if you take the guided 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
 As an alternative, pick up a booklet (50 cents) that lets you explore the 
gardens on your own for an hour or more (similar guide-yourself booklets are 
available for each of the Huntington's principal attractions). Use the map to 
find such must-sees as the Shakespeare garden, which includes everything from 
the violets that all withered when Polonius died to the white roses that were 
the symbol of Richard III as a glorious son of the House of York. The rose 
gardens are one of the Huntington's treasures, a sweet-scented, 
three-dimensional history of roses that starts with centuries-old European 
varieties that bloom only in the spring and continues through the latest 
prize-winning hybrids. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the gardens has its own mood. Especially tranquil and lovely is the 
Japanese garden, with its elegant drum bridge and Japanese house. Spend some 
time in the adjacent Zen garden, in which pebbles have been raked to suggest a 
flowing stream. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huntingtons were hip about xeriscaping long before the rest of us. Perhaps 
the most remarkable botanical display is the 12-acre Desert Garden, which 
includes more than 2,500 species of succulents and other water-conserving 
plants. This is a garden of unlikely colors, bizarre shapes and plants that 
look as if they came from another planet. Much of the water for the gardens 
comes from deep wells on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 2 p.m.: I don't know about you but all that walking has made me hungry. The 
Huntington has a glorified snack bar that serves sandwiches and other light 
fare, but a far better option is the English-style tea, served daily in the 
Rose Garden Tea Room. The ambience is unadulterated Martha Stewart -- and the 
good news is you don't have to paint, stamp or bake anything yourself to 
achieve it. For $11, there is caviar on white bread with egg and scallions and 
other finger sandwiches, dainty sweets such as chocolate tartlets filled with 
lemon curd and, of course, tea. Note that tea at the Huntington is served 
earlier than its British equivalent -- from 1 (noon on weekends) until 3:30 
p.m. Reservations are recommended. Call (818) 683-8131. 
</P>
<P>
 2:45 p.m.: Until Aug. 30, the main exhibition hall of the soaring Huntington 
Library is home to an extraordinary exhibit called "The Last Best Hope of 
Earth: Abraham Lincoln and the Promise of America." One of the most 
comprehensive Lincoln exhibits ever mounted, it presents the Great 
Emancipator's life and achievements through 200 rare documents and artifacts, 
many from the vast private collection of Louise and Barry Taper. A 
collaboration between the Huntington and the Illinois State Historical Library, 
the show gives visitors a unique opportunity to consider both Lincoln's 
greatness and his complexity (there are no plans for the exhibit to travel). 
Some of the material takes you deep into goose-bump territory -- one of five 
copies of the Gettysburg address in Lincoln's hand, for instance. Here are the 
gloves the doomed President carried to Ford's Theater the night of April 14, 
1865 (he died 129 years ago today). Look closely, and you'll see what appears 
to be dried blood along one side. Vicious racist material illustrates the 
depths to which the supporters of slavery were willing to go to oppose Lincoln. 
And there is abundant evidence that Lincoln could be as scathing as he was 
eloquent. Consider the note he wrote to Gen. George M. McClellan two weeks 
before firing him. McClellan had complained that his horses were fatigued. 
Lincoln inquired: "Will you pardon me for asking what the horses of your army 
have done since the battle of Antietam that fatigue anything?" 
</P>
<P>
 Just beyond the Lincoln show in the library's west foyer is a small jewel of 
an exhibit on the advent of printing and the creation of a reading public. 
Three of the items on display, all from the Huntington's collection, speak 
volumes about the institution and its spectacular bibliographic holdings. They 
are the Ellesmere manuscript of Chaucer's "The Canterbury Tales" from about 
1410, a Gutenberg Bible and a first folio of Shakespeare's plays (1623). The 
exhibit continues through Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 3:45 p.m.: You only have 15 minutes left if you are really committed to this 
three-hour tour business. So hustle right over to the Huntington Art Gallery, 
once the residence of Henry and Arabella. The Main Gallery contains Thomas 
Gainsborough's "Blue Boy," an object of pilgrimage for most Huntington 
visitors. Facing the famous portrait is "Pinkie" -- almost as familiar -- by 
Thomas Lawrence. If you had more time, you could walk through the newly 
refurbished Virginia Steele Scott Gallery of American Art, which reopens 
Tuesday. But you'll have to save that for your next three-hour tour of the 
Huntington. WHERE AND WHEN

RESTAURANT REVIEW; CHANGE FOR THE BETTER; * A NEW CHEF AT CANYON BISTRO 
DRAMATICALLY IMPROVES AN AILING MENU. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Canyon, a new American bistro, got off to a rather shaky start, but today it's 
back on track. Here's how the story went down. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that the original idea was to bring the foods of David Slay, 
proprietor of the still-hot La Veranda in Beverly Hills, to the San Fernando 
Valley. So Slay came into the Canyon project as consulting chef, providing 
several of his more popular dishes, such as toasted ravioli, peppered rib steak 
and leg of lamb with white beans and a mint au jus . Slay's place in Beverly 
Hills has been wildly successful, and the hope was that the magic of his name 
would drum up crowds of customers. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't. So now Canyon's head chef Mark Baida, a talented young man with 
Trumps and Posto on his resume, has taken several of Slay's dishes off the menu 
and substituted dishes from his own repertoire. I must say the improvement has 
been dramatic.  
</P>
<P>
 This is not meant as any slight to Slay. A chef is understandably better off 
cooking the dishes he is most comfortable with, and that appears to be just 
what Baida is doing. 
</P>
<P>
 One Wednesday evening before the Great Change, my group of five constituted 
the only table in the restaurant, except for the one occupied by 
football-player-turned-actor Fred Dryer ("Hunter"), who was keeping himself 
company at one of the snazzy cloth-upholstered booths. When I returned with 
friends the following Saturday, though, the Great Change had taken place. The 
restaurant was crowded, and the kitchen was running more smoothly than 
expected. I'll bet you can guess which meal was better. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who visited Canyon in recent months may have noticed that five of the 
eight appetizers revolved around cheese. On the new menu, it's more like two 
out of seven. (Oddly, though, the acclaimed toasted ravioli didn't contain 
cheese before. These ravioli, a Slay specialty, now have a three-cheese filling 
instead of the minced chicken and veal of the original recipe.) 
</P>
<P>
 Today you might start a meal here with crisp calamari astride a smooth 
pesto-chile aioli or grilled Portobello mushrooms with a citrus sauce. And 
there is still the option of ordering the chef's delicious thin-crust pizzas, 
with exotic toppings ranging from pancetta with black olives, sun-dried 
tomatoes and Gouda cheese to a more recognizable pepperoni pizza, with good 
roasted red and yellow peppers thrown in for good measure. 
</P>
<P>
 That could explain why the pastas also work well. I'll miss Slay's penne with 
duck, but the excellent rigatoni in garlic marinara makes up for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The main courses, too, seem a little less overboard now. It's a pity that 
Baida had little success with the thin-sliced calf's liver with sherry vinegar 
onion marmalade and mashed potatoes. The liver was hardly sliced thin; the 
potatoes were gummy, and the marmalade, too sweet for the meat. But he's quite 
sensibly removed it from the menu, retaining the roasted pork tenderloin.  
</P>
<P>
 The chef has also added a terrific sesame-studded catfish with black bean 
sauce, a dish that manages to seem Chinese and Japanese at the same time. 
There's also a fine north Atlantic salmon with wild rice.  
</P>
<P>
 Desserts are in the process of being upgraded. At the earlier meal I was 
distressed to find my peach and blackberry cobbler broiled (practically welded) 
onto the dish, and our chocolate mousse cake with chocolate glaze seemed tired. 
But on the return visit, there was a tasty pear mousse cake of a vaguely 
Japanese pastry shop bent, plus good homemade ice creams. WHERE AND WHEN  
</P>

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; 9 STUDENTS FETED FOR EFFORT TO EXPAND 
LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tara Provencher, a fourth-grade student at Flory School in Moorpark, whispered 
to her friend Jihae Simmons that her cheeks hurt from smiling so much. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair, along with seven other Moorpark students, smiled broadly as they 
were awarded certificates and savings bonds from County Supervisor Vicky Howard 
on Thursday. They each won awards for their posters and essays to promote 
interest in a plan to expand the Moorpark Library. 
</P>
<P>
 "Books are your ticket to another world," wrote Ryan Harikul, a sixth-grader 
who won the $100 grand prize for the best essay. "I just pretended I was 
talking to someone, telling them how important the library is," said Ryan, who 
likes to read books by C. S. Lewis and write short stories in his spare time. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother did not know about the contest until her son told her that he had 
won. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's gotten praise for writing in the past but never anything like this," 
Robbin Harikul said. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest was created to increase interest in a telethon May 3 to raise 
money for the library expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moorpark needs a better library," Howard told the nine youths before she 
handed them their prizes. "It's important. I know I spent a lot of time in the 
library as a youngster, as I'm sure some of you do." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said state budget cuts have forced Ventura County to cut the library 
budget by almost 40%, while the growing community has demanded that the library 
keep pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a county pledge for a $260,000 contribution toward the expansion and a 
city pledge for another $65,000, Howard said the library would still be short 
by nearly $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers hope that the telethon will make up the shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said memorabilia donated by local celebrities, including Larry Hagman, 
Tom Selleck and Peter Strauss, will be auctioned during the televised event. 
Former President Ronald Reagan will also show his support with a videotaped 
statement that will be broadcast. SCOTT HADLY

POP NOTES / MIKE BOEHM: NEVILLE BROTHERS SET TO HEADLINE O.C. FAIR; ALONG WITH 
THE NEW ORLEANS GROUP, COUNTRY AND OLDIES BANDS WILL PLAY, FOR THE FIRST TIME 
IN THE PACIFIC AMPHITHEATRE.

<P>
 The nightly concerts at the Orange County Fair will have a bigger, fancier 
venue this year, but the musical slant and the profile of the performers remain 
about the same. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, headliners will perform in the 8,500-seat Pacific 
Amphitheatre, which the fair acquired last year in a $12.5-million buyout of a 
long-term lease held by the Nederlander Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most interesting performers booked for the 1994 fair, which runs 
July 8-24, are the Neville Brothers, a heralded R&B band from New Orleans; 
rapper Queen Latifah, and the veteran Jamaican reggae group Wailing Souls. As 
usual, there is a heavy country and oldies accent: Tim McGraw, Kentucky 
HeadHunters and Three Dog Night are on the list. Also as usual, the musical 
attractions are not hot-ticket acts but performers who play clubs and small 
theaters on their regular Southern California tours. 
</P>
<P>
 The schedule: 
</P>
<P>
 * July 8: Color Me Badd 
</P>
<P>
 * July 9: Three Dog Night 
</P>
<P>
 * July 10: Queen Latifah 
</P>
<P>
 * July 11: Michael McDonald 
</P>
<P>
 * July 12: Ben E. King, the Shirelles, Chuck (Tequila) Rio & the Champs, and 
the Monte Carlos 
</P>
<P>
 * July 13: Restless Heart 
</P>
<P>
 * July 14: Loverboy 
</P>
<P>
 * July 15: Neville Brothers 
</P>
<P>
 * July 16: Tom Scott and John Tesch 
</P>
<P>
 * July 17: Comedians Kevin Nealon, Steve McGrew and Steve Kelley 
</P>
<P>
 * July 18: Kentucky HeadHunters 
</P>
<P>
 * July 19: Wailing Souls 
</P>
<P>
 * July 20: Tim McGraw 
</P>
<P>
 * July 21: Marshall Tucker Band 
</P>
<P>
 * July 22: Crystal Gayle 
</P>
<P>
 * July 23: Jan & Dean 
</P>
<P>
 * July 24: Vicki Carr 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, fair headliners would play two shows each night in the 
6,000-capacity Arlington Theatre. This year, says fair media officer Jill 
Lloyd, there will be a single performance each night, at 8. Seating will be on 
a first-come basis; the amphitheater lawn, which can hold about 11,000 people, 
will not be used. There will be no charge for the entertainment beyond the 
regular fair admission, $5 on weekdays and $6 on weekends ($4 advance tickets 
will be available along with $2 children's tickets and $3 seniors' tickets). 
Information: (714) 708-3247.

EXPRESSING PASSION FOR A PAINTER; ART: BIOGRAPHER JAMES BRESLIN FELL IN LOVE 
WITH THE ABSTRACT STYLE OF MARK ROTHKO, HE TELLS A LAGUNA ART MUSEUM AUDIENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During the eight years that UC Berkeley English professor James E. B. Breslin 
toiled over the research and writing of the first biography of Abstract 
Expressionist painter Mark Rothko, people were always asking him why he was 
doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, as Breslin explained dryly during a lecture Wednesday night at the 
Laguna Art Museum, people asked him three questions: Why are you writing it? 
Why are you writing a biography (as opposed to, say, an art historical 
monograph)? And why are you writing about Rothko instead of Jackson Pollock or 
Frank Sinatra? 
</P>
<P>
 Breslin, whose "Mark Rothko" was published by University of Chicago Press last 
year, explained that his passion for Rothko dates back to a winter day in 1979 
when he happened to drop into the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, 
where the brooding painter famous for his floating rectangles of color from the 
1950s and '60s was having a posthumous retrospective. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fell in love with the kind of paintings Rothko began in 1949 and continued 
for the next 20 years," Breslin recalled. "I was swept up by these commanding 
paintings, with their spirituality, sensuality, emotional charge and aggressive 
edge. They were tremendously beautiful, but not merely beautiful. They made 
abstract painting come alive to me as a language." 
</P>
<P>
 But why, Breslin wondered, did Rothko -- who was 46 in 1949 -- suddenly begin 
to paint the rectangles after 25 years of being a relatively minor painter? 
(Rothko had worked in figurative styles and an abstract linear fashion similar 
to that of fellow Abstract Expressionist Arshile Gorky before developing the 
scattered, soft-edged shapes of color that immediately preceded the 
rectangles.) 
</P>
<P>
 For some art historians, reasons for Rothko's major stylistic shift can be 
found in the spirit of a particular time and place -- New York City in the '40s 
-- where a group of artists were searching for a newly powerful, distinctly 
American way of making their mark on canvas. 
</P>
<P>
 But Breslin, who is not an art historian, said he sought the answer at the 
point where "life and painting might coincide." The advantage of a biography, 
he noted, is that it can accommodate social, psychological and economic 
questions (such as the effect of the burgeoning art market during the 1950s and 
'60s on Rothko's production) as well as strictly artistic issues. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rothko was born Marcus Rothkowitz in the Russian town of Dvinsk in 1903, two 
years before the czar's soldiers brutally repressed a local demonstration 
against the anti-Jewish pogroms in other cities. When he was a sickly child of 
7, his father immigrated alone to the United States. Two years later, his older 
brothers followed the father and a year after that, the rest of the family was 
united in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, leaving Russia meant more freedom and security, Breslin said. 
But on the other hand, the child was removed from his home, his school, his 
street, his language, culture -- even his climate. Meanwhile, his father had 
fallen ill. Six months after 10-year-old Rothko came to the United States, his 
father died. 
</P>
<P>
 "What did this succession of losses mean to Rothko?," Breslin asked. Even 
though the artist-to-be was part of a huge wave of immigrants, "Rothko 
experienced his emigration as an event unique to him," Breslin said. "He 
resisted assimilation, as if he wished to pursue what he had left. . . . It was 
as if he assumed that he could best hold himself together by holding himself 
apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Pursuing this approach, Breslin quoted Rothko's remark about viewing his art 
as "unknown adventures in an unknown space -- a journey toward freedom." 
Breslin even remarked on the absence of people, places and objects in Rothko's 
paintings of the '50s and '60s as indicative of "solitude" and "loss," even 
though other artists (presumably carrying different biographical baggage) also 
had abandoned those elements. 
</P>
<P>
 Breslin described Rothko as "physically restless" with a "ravenous appetite" 
for food and alcohol and a need for "companionship from men, consolation from 
women and adulation from both." He was "very eager for (his paintings) to be 
loved -- in exactly the way he wanted." As the poet Stanley Kunitz remarked to 
Breslin, Rothko had "a great vacuum at the center of his being." 
</P>
<P>
 Breslin dwelt on the death of Rothko's mother in 1948 as a direct influence on 
the rectangles that began to appear in the paintings the following year, though 
he also proposed several other sources for the change in imagery, including 
Rothko's close friendship with painter Clyfford Still and the increasing use of 
abstraction by other painters of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "But why the rectangle?," someone in the audience asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the rectangles are "grave-like," Breslin replied. The death of 
Rothko's mother was both a "liberating" and "melancholy" experience. "I think 
(the paintings) are about mourning. They turn despair into this beautiful 
transcendence."

MOVIE REVIEW; RARE VITALITY SHINES THROUGH IN 'ALI'; FASSBINDER'S STORY OF 
INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE AND RACISM IS DRIVEN BY THE GERMAN FILMMAKER'S FERVOR AND 
HONESTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During the late '60s and early '70s, Rainer Werner Fassbinder was the tireless 
road runner of the German cinema. Between 1969 and 1973, the politically minded 
filmmaker churned out 19 movies, a prodigious amount by any standard. 
</P>
<P>
 Fassbinder didn't waste any time between projects -- he'd finish one in the 
morning and start another by afternoon. It was during this particularly fertile 
period that Fassbinder made "Ali -- Fear Eats the Soul," a story about an 
interracial marriage between an elderly German washerwoman and a younger 
Moroccan worker. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1973 release (screening tonight at Saddleback College) is characteristic 
of the Fassbinder style, meaning it explores injustice and intolerance in human 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Fassbinder has been described as a quixotic figure in the international film 
scene, simply because his commitment to creating challenging movies was often 
tested by a public, and even many critics, that neglected his work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A fuller appreciation of his career came after 1982, when Fassbinder was found 
slumped over an editing table, a cigarette between his fingers, apparently the 
victim of a drug overdose. He's remembered these days as a director with an 
irrepressible social vision and the willfulness to match. "Ali" was one of the 
early films that did reach a fairly large audience. It was his first to open in 
London and it went on to win the critics' prize at the 1974 Cannes 
International Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 The tale is melodramatic, which is typical of Fassbinder. Emmi (Brigitte Mira) 
meets the shy Ali (El Hedi Ben Salem) in an isolated bar she has ducked into to 
escape a rainstorm. Despite their backgrounds and ages (he's at least 20 years 
younger), they discover how alike they are. 
</P>
<P>
 Their openness and compassion link them, but their friends and neighbors 
aren't so generous. Ali and Emmi are ostracized, and Fassbinder uses that to 
probe his themes of racism and Germans' distrust of foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ali" is, like many of Fassbinder's movies, slight and messy, but it's driven 
by his usual fervor and honesty. There's a sense that he was working fast, 
through a compellingly personal inspiration, and that gives the film a rare 
vitality. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture also features one of Fassbinder's better-known scenes, coming soon 
after Emmi and Ali meet. They begin to dance, his cheek tight against her 
forehead, eyes closed in something approaching bliss. She clutches him but 
gazes out, a shade of anxiety to her face. The passage is about love and need, 
but it's also about fear and foreboding.

BOY CHARGED IN TEACHER'S POISONING; CRIME: THE LITTLEROCK HIGH STUDENT FACES 
ONE FELONY COUNT. HIS CONVICTION COULD BRING UP TO EIGHT YEARS IN A DETENTION 
CENTER.

<P>
 Prosecutors filed a felony charge Thursday against a 15-year-old Littlerock 
High School student accused of poisoning his English teacher by putting four to 
five drops of toxic cleaning fluid in her Diet Pepsi. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, whose name is being withheld because of his age, faces a single count 
of poisoning or adulterating a food or drink, authorities said. If convicted, 
he faces a maximum sentence of five years in a juvenile detention center and an 
additional three years if it is determined the act caused the victim, Susan 
Ennis, great bodily harm. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy is scheduled to be arraigned today in Sylmar juvenile court, according 
to the Los Angeles district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Ennis, 32, was rushed to the hospital last week after she took a gulp from a 
can of soda laced with dry-eraser fluid, prompting her to become violently ill. 
She was discharged from Palmdale Hospital Medical Center on Tuesday afternoon 
in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies arrested her alleged assailant after students overheard him 
boasting that he had placed cleaning fluid in the soda can as a joke, Sheriff's 
Sgt. Jerry Wolf said. The boy confessed to detectives during an interview that 
he had committed the act.  
</P>
<P>
 Reaction to the boy's arrest was mixed at the Antelope Valley campus, where 
several students, interviewed as they left school Wednesday, said they were 
surprised to learn which of their peers had been connected to the poisoning.  
</P>
<P>
 News of the arrest, however, came as no surprise to Pablo Vega, who said he 
was in Ennis' second-period English class when the incident took place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Him (the student) and that teacher (Ennis) didn't get along," Vega said. 
</P>
<P>
 One school official described the boy as "a loner," but also as "spontaneous" 
and as "an attention getter." 
</P>
<P>
 The youth was known to walk through the school cafeteria clapping his hands 
loudly in the air, said Bob Girolamo, superintendent of Antelope Valley Union 
High School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was somewhat of a kid who was just on his own," Girolamo said. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains unknown when Ennis, who is recovering at home, will return to 
school. Jim Gardner, president of the Antelope Valley Teacher's Assn., said 
that Ennis' doctor has recommended that she not return to her classroom for the 
rest of the school year, which ends June 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner said he told Ennis during a phone conversation this week that if she 
does choose to return she should consider having a special teacher's aide or 
security guard assigned to her classroom. He said he posed the suggestion out 
of concern that Ennis may face retaliation by friends of the accused boy, who 
has been suspended from school. 
</P>
<P>
 Girolamo said as a result of the poisoning, he is encouraging teachers 
throughout his district not to allow eating or drinking inside classrooms.

GLENDALE SEEKS ALTERNATIVES TO KILLING PIGEONS; ANIMALS: BIRDS ARE A NUISANCE 
TO DOWNTOWN BUSINESSES. BUT MANY CITIZENS REACT ANGRILY TO EUTHANASIA PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Two days after voting to stem the city's burgeoning pigeon population by 
trapping and killing the birds through methods that include carbon monoxide 
poisoning, Glendale officials Thursday said they are considering more humane 
ways to rid the downtown area of the pesky fowl. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they were deluged with calls from angry residents and 
animal-rights activists after Tuesday's unanimous vote to catch and euthanize 
hundreds of the prolific birds, and now consider euthanasia as "a last resort." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they said they are looking at non-lethal ways to curb the population, 
such as repellents, netting or plastic owls or falcons, which are supposed to 
scare the birds away. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were no alternatives presented to us in the first place because we were 
contracting with the county and the county said euthanasia was the only way to 
do it," said Councilman Larry Zarian. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's vote followed merchant complaints that pigeons had overtaken 
downtown office buildings and outdoor restaurants, dirtying awnings, ledges and 
benches and ruining the Civic Center's appearance. Officials also voiced 
concern about diseases transmitted via pigeon droppings -- notably salmonella 
and tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale, which would have contracted with Los Angeles County to trap and kill 
the birds, was the first city in the county to adopt such a sweeping 
pigeon-eradication measure. Outraged residents and animal-rights groups loudly 
protested when county officials disclosed that they would kill pigeons through 
carbon-monoxide poisoning by putting them in a bag and tying it to the tailpipe 
of a running vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are all kinds of impurities in vehicle exhaust that can burn their eyes 
and destroy their mucous membranes," said Leslie Press, a biologist with People 
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Press said that while the carbon-monoxide poisoning method is inhumane, it's 
not uncommon and is used by companies around the nation to control pigeon 
populations. However, she added, lethal methods do not work because they do not 
ensure that other pigeons won't return to roost in the area.  
</P>
<P>
 Richard Wightman, the county's deputy agricultural commissioner, said the 
carbon-monoxide method "has not been a common practice and it's not an old 
practice. We have simply used it several times when we needed an expedient way 
to get rid of birds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had used carbon monoxide for jobs at smaller buildings, but not on any 
larger scale like the Glendale job would be," Wightman said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the county is studying the use of lethal injection to control pigeon 
populations. The county Department of Animal Control would perform this 
procedure, which involves injecting each bird with a barbiturate that would put 
it to sleep in seconds.  
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Los 
Angeles said the group does not approve of the carbon-monoxide method but 
euthanasia by lethal injection is acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Glendale council's request, the city manager's office is drafting a 
report on alternative methods to rid the city's Civic Center of pigeons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because people have been calling and protesting our decision, we decided to 
get more information on alternatives to deter the pigeons," Zarian said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager David Ramsay said the report will include residents' ideas on how 
to control the city's pigeon population. Residents interested in providing 
advice to the city can write to City Hall at 613 Broadway. City staff will 
research each idea for its viability before placing it in the report, Ramsay 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the nation, cities have adopted methods other than euthanasia to 
control pigeons after residents and animal-rights groups complained about the 
method, which they termed cruel and unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1970s, San Francisco trapped hundreds of the determined birds, 
shipped them 100 miles north and let them go, said Carl Friedman, director of 
the San Francisco Department for Animal Care and Control.  
</P>
<P>
 The effort backfired because birds died in holding cages and others were said 
to have returned to the city, Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco has since enacted laws against trapping, releasing and killing 
the birds and also prohibits feeding the fowl in any but nine designated areas 
in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators in New York and Washington have contracted with a Boston firm, 
BirdMaster, to "bird-proof" theaters, hotels and government buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 BirdMaster draped a 30- by 45-foot net, guaranteed to last for the life of the 
structure, over the facade of the Federal Bureau of Investigation building to 
prevent pigeons from landing, said the company's John Pace. 
</P>
<P>
 The netting, invisible from a distance, also has been hung on the Lincoln 
Memorial, the Department of Agriculture and the Justice Department.  
</P>
<P>
 San Diego reduced the pigeon population in Balboa Park from 8,000 to 1,000 by 
spiking pigeon corn feed with a birth-control substance. San Clemente used a 
similar method to slow population increases in a flock inhabiting the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis officials installed six loudspeakers in the University City soccer 
facility to scare away the birds with ultrasonic waves -- which are inaudible 
to people but supposedly annoy birds and drive them away. 
</P>
<P>
 But some Glendale officials are leery of how effective some alternatives would 
be in driving the birds away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the suggestions only move birds from one place to another. We need a 
more permanent solution," said Mayor Eileen Givens.

MONTHS OF STUDY MAKE TAFT THE DECATHLON FAVORITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nine teen-agers from William Howard Taft High School changed their motto 
just before they headed off to New Jersey to represent California this weekend 
at the U.S. Academic Decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the long months preparing for their successful bids at the city and 
state competitions, the group daily looked at their own words of wisdom 
inscribed on coach Arthur Berchin's blackboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we do our best, we'll win," it read. "If we don't win, we didn't do our 
best." 
</P>
<P>
 But after the Taft team members returned from their win in Stockton last 
month, when they beat 42 teams from around the state, they altered their 
motivational slogan. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we try our hardest, we'll win," they wrote. "If we lose, we took too much 
time off." 
</P>
<P>
 Their two days off after their state victory must have weighed on their 
consciences. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Kimberly Shapiro, 16, explained the team's caution. "Only one team in 
the entire country can win nationals," she said. "What are the odds against 
you?" 
</P>
<P>
 In all, team members has worked hundreds of hours to prepare for their 
challenge, which begins today with a series of written exams. The team will 
compete against the best students from 41 other states in 10 events: math, fine 
arts, economics, science, literature, social studies, speech, essay, interview 
and Super Quiz -- an oral competition held game-show style. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme of this year's Super Quiz is the Documents of Freedom; students will 
be tested on a group of documents including the Declaration of Independence, 
the Camp David Accords and the May 16 Declaration from China's Tian An Men 
square. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on each team's scores at their state finals, the California team is the 
strong favorite going into the competition. But teams from San Antonio and 
Chicago, which are just behind the Taft team, are not ready to concede. 
</P>
<P>
 "The scores don't mean anything until Taft goes against my kids," said Adriano 
Gonzalez, a coach at Oliver Wendell Holmes High School in San Antonio. "They 
took the tests at different times, under different conditions."  
</P>
<P>
 Larry Minkoff, the coach at Whitney M. Young Magnet School in Chicago, agreed. 
"We're better now that we were at state," he said. "And we're ready to demolish 
Taft." 
</P>
<P>
 Students are placed into three categories, based on grade-point average: 
Students with a 4.0 G.P.A. are in Honors level, those with a 3.0 or better are 
called Scholastic, and those with a 2.0 or higher compete on the Varsity level. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at the Taft Academic Decathlon team:  
</P>
<P>
 DANIEL BERDICHEVSKY, Honors (Woodland Hills). The highest overall scorer at 
both the city and the state competition, Daniel, 17, is described as a natural 
team leader. His main interests are the theoretical sciences -- astronomy, 
physics and the like. But he hopes to combine his skills one day and be a 
writer in the vein of Isaac Asimov. "My entire high school experience has 
become defined by decathlon," he said. "It gives meaning to what you're 
learning. I learned how different people can come together and combine their 
talents to become something greater than they would be otherwise." Daniel has 
been accepted at Harvard University but is still considering attending 
Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 CHRIS HUIE, Scholastic (Tarzana). Chris, who hopes to attend Emory University 
or UC Berkeley and go into business, said up until decathlon, high school was 
not challenging enough. "I never studied that much," he said. "I didn't do that 
bad in my classes but I didn't care at times." Chris, 17, said decathlon also 
forced him to re-examine his thoughts about his own strengths and weaknesses. 
Although he has always liked math, he had a renewed interest in history because 
of his work with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 MICHAEL MICHROWSKI, Scholastic (Tarzana). Mike alternates between being the 
team plant manager and the team punching bag. When the others aren't counting 
on him to close up, lock up or otherwise keep things running, he gets a lot of 
ribbing. His nicknames are Herman (from TV's "The Munsters") and Mosh (origin 
unknown). "I had a chance that most people really don't have, to compete 
against the smartest people and to have the opportunity to go to the national 
competition," he said. "If we win, we'll be able to call ourselves some of the 
best students in the country." He hopes to go to Caltech and be a mechanical or 
electrical engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 SHELDON PEREGRINO, Varsity (Northridge). Sheldon, who hopes to be a 
psychologist one day, said the team has given him a lot of field work. He is 
the team support staff, the one who quietly gets along with everyone and helps 
the others along. His goals are as straightforward as his demeanor. "They're 
all so smart, I don't want to be so far behind them," he said. "I guess if you 
really think about it, it's not such a big deal. Just being part of a team is 
what is important." Sheldon, 18, said he hopes to attend UC Santa Barbara in 
the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 REBECCA RISSMAN, Honors (Encino). Becky, 17, said she ranks second only to the 
coach in terms of worrying about everyone. "It's my personality," she said. "I 
tend to take care of other people. And having seven boys on the team, someone 
has to keep them in line." Although she is not sure exactly what she wants to 
do when she gets out of school, which she hopes will be Stanford University, 
Becky said she cannot imagine herself in a traditional desk job. An exchange 
trip to Costa Rica last year piqued her interest in furthering her Spanish 
skills, and she said she might want to pursue international law. And in 
addition to the knowledge and maturity that she takes away from her experience 
on the team, Becky said she's had an additional reward: Her boyfriend, Andy, is 
one of the other Honors students. 
</P>
<P>
 ANDREW SALTER, Honors (Tarzana). Andy, who was the second-highest scorer 
overall at both the city and the state competitions, said he thrives on 
pressure. Like his teammates, Andy, 17, said he has learned more from his 
experiences than just a collection of facts. He said he is no longer afraid of 
public speaking, has increased his self-confidence and was able to become 
friends with people he otherwise might not have met. "With all this attention 
we're getting for ourselves and the school and the district, you've got to like 
that," Andy said. "Perhaps it will never again happen in my lifetime." Andy, 
who hopes to attend Harvard or Stanford, said he might want to go into business 
or public relations. 
</P>
<P>
 KIMBERLY SHAPIRO, Scholastic (Tarzana). One of the youngest members of the 
team, Kim, 16, is one of those who tries not to take it all too seriously. The 
preparation has been hard for all of them, she said, and has cut into her usual 
attempts to do a lot of different things with her free time. Gone by the 
wayside have been her sports, drama and even some friends. But there have been 
gains, too. After studying economics as part of the decathlon, Kimberly said 
she might revise plans to be a doctor like her father and instead go into 
business. She hopes to attend Duke University in the fall. "This is the hardest 
thing I've ever done," she said. "But I've matured a lot and learned to deal 
with a lot of obstacles." 
</P>
<P>
 STEPHEN SHAW, Scholastic (Tarzana). The team's only junior, Steve, 16, said he 
has no idea where he wants to go to school or what he wants to do when he 
finishes. Although he said he is not likely to participate again next year, he 
said he values the experience mostly because of the people he's met. It has 
also been a growing experience, he said. "I get hyped up about everything," he 
said. "Everyone goes through these emotions but I'm the one who shows it. 
Sometimes they appreciate it and other times they say it's immature of me. But, 
hey, I'm the young one." 
</P>
<P>
 SAGE VAUGHN, Varsity (Chatsworth). With his trademark tweed derby and baggy 
clothes, 17-year-old Sage has worked hard to be the team rebel. "I look more 
like a typical teen-age drug addict than a decathlete," he notes wryly. But 
while Sage has strived to cultivate that image, he has also worked hard to be a 
valued member of the team and earned six medals at last month's state 
competition. "I did it to prove to myself that I could do it," he said, 
explaining why he joined the team. "I never won anything before in my life. 
This was past luck -- this was working really hard to achieve something." Sage 
said he hopes to go to UC Santa Cruz en route to an eventual career as a 
small-town doctor.

HEALING JOURNEY; TOPANGA BLAZE: RON MASS EMERGES AFTER FIVE PAINFUL MONTHS AT 
BURN CENTER, THANKING HIS ONCE-ESTRANGED FAMILY FOR HELPING HIM ON THE ROAD TO 
RECOVERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Slowly, like a wounded soldier who had outlived the war, Ron Mass walked 
unflinchingly Thursday from a Sherman Oaks hospital where he has endured more 
than five months of painful rebirth since being severely burned during last 
fall's Old Topanga blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 His feet wrapped in bandages, his face, neck, arms and hands showing the 
blotchy red ravages of countless skin grafts, Mass ended a 163-day recuperation 
that was the longest inpatient stay in the 25-year history of the Sherman Oaks 
Community Hospital Burn Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite obvious pain, the 40-year-old carpenter's brown eyes shone brightly in 
a sudden flash of pride and recognition that he is still alive -- this dogged 
survivor who had finally beaten the cruel flames.  
</P>
<P>
 On that November morning, Mass had rushed into what was nearly ground zero of 
the blaze -- a Topanga Canyon ranch -- in an unsuccessful effort to save his 
friend, British screenwriter-director Duncan Gibbins, who eventually perished 
trying to save his cat. 
</P>
<P>
 Mass suffered burns on 75% of his body and spent the first eight weeks after 
the fire in a tortured half-sleep as doctors worked around the clock to salvage 
enough healthy skin to replace what had literally melted away. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Christmas and Easter passed, as winter turned to spring and 
once-charred Malibu and Topanga canyons became green and filled with 
wildflowers, Mass continued to heal. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, as he moved to nearby St. Joseph Medical Center to continue his 
physical therapy and long road to recovery, he embodied a final closure to the 
tragic fire that scorched a wide swath of the Santa Monica Mountains, killing 
four, charring 18,000 acres and causing millions of dollars in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 To the applause of hospital staff, Mass padded gingerly down a tiled corridor, 
out into the harsh sunlight and glare of television cameras. In an adjacent 
parking lot -- his trembling right hand held by a sister he had not seen for 12 
years before the fire -- he stood silently and soaked in the adulation that 
must have felt like some postwar victory parade. 
</P>
<P>
 In a weakened voice, Mass thanked his family and doctors, several of whom 
stood behind him, for helping him reach deep inside himself to find a resolve 
not to die, to not let the flames have the final say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed by all this," he said, shooting a glance at 
his sister, Pat Anderson, who squeezed his hand in gentle inspiration. "Without 
the support of my family and friends, their being there all the time, I 
wouldn't have made it. I would not have pulled through." 
</P>
<P>
 Under a revealing morning sun, Mass showed the vestiges of his half-year 
battle. His black hair was matted, his face showed the blotches and veins that 
suggested his new skin was still painfully thin. Dressed in a violet printed 
shirt that hung out over baggy black trousers, his purplish hands shook 
uncontrollably. 
</P>
<P>
 Still sensitive about his injuries, Mass had asked that cameramen refrain from 
close-ups of his face, especially his burned nose and ears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ron still feels sort of funny about his looks," said his friend Peter 
Alexander, who owns the 10-acre ranch where Mass once worked and lived in a 
trailer and where Gibbins had rented a small bungalow. "His most difficult 
moment came a month ago, when he saw a reflection of himself in a pane of 
glass. He still doesn't want to look into any mirrors." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mass has come a long way from the morning of Nov. 2, when he was rushed to 
the burn center with what doctors now say was "about a zero chance of 
survival," a patient whose feet were the only part of his body left untouched 
by the fire. They were later used for skin grafting. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting 104-degree fevers, Mass began the first of about 35 surgeries to 
combine donor skin with comparatively healthy skin from his chest and upper 
thighs to cover the rest of his body -- twice-weekly surgeries that became 
increasingly painful. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, there was more bad news than good. Mass developed an infection that 
caused some of the newly applied skin to slip away. "The more conscious he 
became," Alexander said, "the more he dreaded those operations." 
</P>
<P>
 As the skin finally started to heal, Mass began the agonizing therapy to 
relearn to move his wounded hands, which suffered such severe tendon damage 
that he needs help eating, injuries that still leave his shaky signature 
unrecognizable. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his recovery, Mass was haunted by images of his unsuccessful 
attempt to save Gibbins -- bitter scenes of flames roaring around him, melting 
the tires on his Jeep during his escape, forcing him to run the last 500 feet 
to safety with his arms over his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He remembers that day but he doesn't like to think about it," Alexander said. 
"He doesn't like fire." 
</P>
<P>
 For months, Mass has been reminded of his friendship with the good-natured 
Gibbins, how Mass yelled at his rescuers that Gibbins was still somewhere in 
the fire zone. And how the director's last words to rescuers -- "Did they save 
my friend?" -- referred to Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 But he received the most helpful therapy when he awoke one day to see the 
faces of his long-estranged family over his bed. Anderson explained that a 
sister in the San Francisco area had seen a newspaper photograph of her brother 
covered in flames. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite 12 years of not knowing where Mass was living or what he was up to, 
the family rushed to his side. Mass recalls their presence as an ocean of calm 
amid his pain. 
</P>
<P>
 His six sisters, he said, "all started talking to me like we had never stopped 
talking, like the conversation had just kept going all those years. They were 
very supportive. They didn't bother me with questions about what I had been 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
 While doctors marvel at his recovery, Mass sees his survival as a chance to 
make up for past mistakes. And, most of all, to reunite with his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said her brother's ordeal has taught her a lesson. "Don't ever let 
something silly come between you and your family. Do something now to make 
amends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't wait, like I did, until you almost lose them."

PUPILS SCORE HIGHER ON DISTRICT'S TEST; OXNARD: OFFICIALS SAY THE LOCAL EXAM 
REVEALS EIGHTH-GRADERS HAVE BETTER MATH SKILLS THAN STATE ASSESSMENT INDICATES. 
</P>

<P>
 Frustrated with its low scores on a new statewide test, the Oxnard Elementary 
School District decided to come up with its own test of student achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 The results are in: Oxnard students did much better on the district's test. 
The math exam, given to the district's 767 eighth-grade students, revealed that 
they have better math skills than the state test showed, district Supt. Norman 
R. Brekke said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14-question test was developed by a teacher who serves as the district's 
math mentor and principals of the district's two intermediate schools, Fremont 
and Haydock. 
</P>
<P>
 The exam was administered after results of the state's California Learning 
Assessment System test ranked Oxnard's eighth-graders 14th out of the 17 
districts in Ventura County that took the test. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that through the (district) test, we were able to verify and validate 
that our youngsters have basic math skills," Brekke said. "I was pleased with 
the response, and I would give them a B or B minus." 
</P>
<P>
 The test results, which were presented to the Oxnard school board late 
Wednesday, showed that 74% of the students answered 10 or more of the 14 
questions correctly, while 22% responded correctly to between six and nine of 
the questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The CLAS test measured students not against each other but according to 
performance standards set by a task force that included educators, school board 
members, business leaders, parents and testing experts. The tests were given 
statewide last spring in grades four, eight and 10. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials said Oxnard is the first district they know of that has 
reacted to the CLAS test by writing and implementing its own exam. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear that this test differs from the state test," said Susie Lange, 
spokeswoman for the state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 She said it would be unfair to compare the two tests because Oxnard's exam 
seemed to be measuring different skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the state test, which had open-ended questions that called for students 
to give an analysis with charts and graphs of how they solved the problem, 
Oxnard's test simply involved basic math problems, said district official Kathy 
Cooper, who helped develop the test. 
</P>
<P>
 "This test basically dealt with computation," Cooper said. "It dealt primarily 
with basic addition, subtraction, division and multiplication." 
</P>
<P>
 The district's test included two problems in addition, two in subtraction and 
two in multiplication. Four questions involved computations using decimals, and 
four involved fractions. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15% of the students answered all 14 questions correctly, but about 8% 
were unable to answer one of the two basic addition questions correctly, and 
about 20% were not able to solve one of the two basic subtraction questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Four percent of the students taking the district's test, which was given in 
English and Spanish, answered five or fewer questions correctly. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite achieving reasonable scores in the district's test, students showed 
deficiency in resolving basic math problems that involved decimals and 
fractions, Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did not perform well in multiplying and dividing decimals and 
fractions," she said. "They knew how to solve the problem but they put the 
decimal point in the wrong place." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper said that although the district will continue teaching students basic 
math skills, officials believe that students are ready to learn how to apply 
those skills in solving more complex mathematical problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers of the district exam selected questions from a textbook for 
seventh- and eighth-graders called "Mathematics Unlimited"; it is approved by 
the state and meets guidelines set by the state math framework, Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's tests were corrected by math mentor Barbara McFayden, who 
teaches eighth-grade math at Fremont, and a member of the PTA. 
</P>
<P>
 It cost the district about $300 to administer the test, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members, who were pleased with the results of the test, may decide later 
to give a similar test in reading to either seventh- or eighth-grade students, 
trustee Jack T. Fowler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fowler said he believes that the district test results show that students are 
doing well, but he said there is still room for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The test results were not anything to jump up and down about," said Fowler, 
who suggested that the district give its own test. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they showed that the best majority of our students really have a solid 
grounding in basic math concepts." 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Mary Barreto said she hopes that the test results will motivate 
teachers to raise the level of students' mathematical skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am hoping that teachers will look at the test results and increase their 
expectations," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly need to set higher goals. Having 74% of the students doing well 
is not enough; we need them all to do well." CLAS Eighth-Grade Test Sample

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: 9 RESIDENTS ARE HONORED FOR ACTS OF HEROISM 
</P>

 A year ago last February, truck driver John Sullivan was tooling along Oxnard 
Street in Encino when a horrifying scene unfolded in front of him: A man 
wielding a large knife chased another man across the street and began stabbing 
him. Without another thought, Sullivan sprung into action. He rammed the car in 
front of him to get it out of the way, then drove onto the sidewalk to where 
the two men were fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Encino resident pried the knife away from the assailant, and while the 
attacker was pinned under the body weight of the victim, applied a tourniquet 
to staunch the gushing blood of the wounded man. He yelled at onlookers to call 
for help. Police and paramedics arrived several minutes later and the attacker 
was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan and eight others were honored as heroes by two booster clubs 
affiliated with the Los Angeles Police Department, the West Valley and 
Devonshire Police Activity League Supporters (PALS), at an annual citizens 
recognition luncheon at the Airtel Plaza Hotel in Van Nuys on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were able to overlook the hazards to themselves and were able to do the 
right thing and get involved," said LAPD Sgt. Walt Kainz. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the honorees was Dennis D. Smith, who engaged in a shootout with two 
would-be robbers after one pointed a gun at him at his mother's Reseda 
locksmith business in August. Smith wounded one suspect and convinced the 
gunman to throw down his weapon and a diamond ring that they had yanked off the 
finger of Smith's mother, Jean Smith. The Los Angeles lawyer kept the suspects 
at bay until the police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers Brenda Panameno, Gloria Arenivar and Jesus Garay were toasted for 
spotting a child molester suspect at Lanark Park and stalling him until police 
came to pick him up. Their successful ploy was deceptively simple: They 
challenged him to a game of Ping-Pong. 
</P>
<P>
 Others honored included: James Zeigler and Troy Galloway, who followed armed 
robbers in Granada Hills and West Hills, respectively, and contributed to their 
eventual arrest; Richard Silberberg, who followed a hit-and-run driver in 
Northridge and directed a police officer to the driver, and Raider Alba, who 
helped the officer get him under control. KAY HWANGBO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: ACLU CHALLENGES DAY-LABORER LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union, seeking to overturn a day 
laborer law in Agoura Hills that could have far-reaching ramifications across 
the region, presented their challenge to a three-member panel of the state 
appellate court Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The city ordinance, passed in July, 1991, as a traffic safety measure, 
prohibits day laborers from soliciting work from cars in the roadway or 
gesturing from the sidewalk to passing motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 Rochelle Browne, the attorney representing the city, said the law is 
constitutional and that laborers can still solicit work from motorists parked 
in legal parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 The civil rights organization is arguing that the law is a smoke screen to 
conceal its true intention -- to prevent mostly Latino male laborers from 
standing along roadways or on sidewalks and seeking work anywhere in the city 
-- said Robin Toma, the ACLU attorney handling the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which provides police services 
under contract to the city, is named in the lawsuit brought by the legal 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have applied it in a way that is discriminatory," he said. In the past, 
deputies have forced day laborers from the cars of prospective employers, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome of the case is being watched closely by several cities in the 
Greater Los Angeles area and the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, which 
is considering a similar measure in the unincorporated area of Ladera Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 State Appellate Judges Earl Johnson, Mildred Lillie and Frederick Woods are 
expected to render a decision within 90 days, said attorneys for both sides.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; PIERCE POOL TO USE NON-CHLORINE SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last year, the Pierce College swimming pool nearly became history when Pierce 
administrators threatened to close it because of a lack of repair funds.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, thanks to $72,000 in state funds to install what could be the first 
ozone-bromine water sanitizing system in Los Angeles County, the pool is about 
to make history. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gone from an about-to-be-closed hole in the ground to one of the top 
aquatic facilities in Southern California," said Harald Johnson, president of 
Friends of Pierce Pool, a group formed last year to save the pool from 
extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 The pool water will be sanitized with an ozone-bromine system, which lacks the 
characteristics of chlorine that cause eyes to burn and turn red, hair to take 
on a greenish hue and skin to become dry and itchy. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of adding chlorine to the water, the system pumps ozone -- a pale-blue 
gas formed by passing compressed air through an electrical charge -- into the 
pool. The ozone burns up nearly all of the impurities in the water. Bromine 
pellets are added to further sanitize it. 
</P>
<P>
 Pool experts say the system has been around for several years, but is becoming 
more common as an alternative to chlorine gas, which is considered a hazardous 
material. The Los Angeles County Department of Health will monitor the system 
-- which is said to be the first one in use in the county -- as a test case.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; ARRAIGNMENT DELAYED FOR JACK NICHOLSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An arraignment for Jack Nicholson, who is charged with attacking a 
Mercedes-Benz with a golf club, was delayed for a second time Thursday so his 
attorney could continue working on a deal that would effectively dismiss the 
charges, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing in Van Nuys Municipal Court without the Oscar-winning actor, defense 
attorney Charles R. English was allowed to put off the arraignment until April 
26, saying he was trying to arrange a meeting between Nicholson and the driver 
of the Mercedes, according to Deputy City Atty. Jeff Harkavy. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson is charged with misdemeanor counts of assault and vandalism for 
allegedly using a 3-iron to smash the windshield and roof of Robert Scott 
Blank's car. Blank, a 38-year-old Hollywood resident, was near the intersection 
of Moorpark Way and Riverside Drive in Toluca Lake when the Feb. 8 incident 
occurred. Prosecutors have said Nicholson may have believed that Blank cut him 
off in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Blank subsequently filed a lawsuit against Nicholson, but the matter has been 
settled for an undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson is reportedly seeking a "civil compromise" in the criminal action. 
California law allows a judge to permanently stay misdemeanor criminal actions 
if the victim receives compensation in civil court. 
</P>
<P>
 A civil compromise effectively dismisses the charges in a case and prevents 
authorities from later prosecuting. 
</P>
<P>
 English refused to confirm that he is actively seeking a civil compromise, but 
the attorney acknowledged "that is one of the possible resolutions to the case 
given that Mr. Nicholson and Mr. Blank have settled their civil differences." 
</P>
<P>
 Stressing that he is not trying to single out Nicholson, Harkavy said that 
"due to the degree of violence," his office strenuously opposes this type of 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case went beyond property damage," Harkavy said. "As alleged in the 
complaint, Mr. Nicholson assaulted the victim, and he suffered some minor 
injuries." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said the golf club shattered Blank's windshield and several 
small pieces of glass struck his face. THOM MROZEK

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUNLAND; DONATIONS SOUGHT FOR NEW SCHOOL LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake derailed the completion of the new Mount Gleason 
Middle School Library, which had been scheduled to be finished next week, but 
school officials are trying to get donations for books to fill its shelves in 
time for fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were hoping the library might be open for the open house next week," said 
Wendy Osborn, the school librarian.But although she will not be able to show 
parents a new library, Osborn said she still planned to ask them for donations 
to restock the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sunland library had been destroyed almost three years ago by a fire set by 
thieves who did $250,000 in damage. A collection of 11,000 books and 300 
videotapes had been destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, a temporary library had been opened in a former school shop room. 
So far nearly 5,000 books have been collected, about half of what is needed for 
a workable school library, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where we run into problems is if a whole class is working on a particular 
subject and we don't have enough to go around," she said. Those who cannot find 
the books have to resort to using only encyclopedia articles. 
</P>
<P>
 Mount Gleason Vice Principal John McLaughlin said that construction of the new 
library -- which started in November -- would have been finished by next week, 
however, "nobody counted on Jan. 17." Although the construction continued, it 
had been slowed down as school district officials then had to focus on several 
different projects, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McLaughlin said the library may be finished by the end of the school year in 
mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least we can see the end in sight," McLaughlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborn said that she was hoping to buy more paperback books, adventure stories 
and nonfiction works. ED BOND FINANCES

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; MOTEL OWNERS, BRAUDE DISCUSS SECURITY ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of Sepulveda Boulevard motel owners and managers whose businesses have 
been ordered to hire security for allegedly allowing prostitution finally got 
the chance Thursday to meet one of their chief accusers face-to-face. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was clear that it would require more work before they could see 
eye-to-eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are pushing into a new area here and this is the way we have to solve 
society's problems with businesses and residents working together," Los Angeles 
City Councilman Marvin Braude said during a meeting with motel owners at the 
Carriage Inn on Sepulveda Boulevard. "I want a resolution, but I don't want an 
interminable delay." 
</P>
<P>
 Motel owners had come to discuss the problems of hiring security, one of 27 
conditions imposed by the city zoning officials on five Sepulveda Boulevard 
motels -- the Chateau, Town House, El Cortez, Cinema and Bali Hi. 
</P>
<P>
 The city action was initiated by Braude, who said his office had received 
several complaints against the motels from residents. Police also told city 
officials that the motels were magnets for crime, particularly prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 All but the Chateau have filed an appeal to the conditions, which will be 
heard Tuesday. However, motel owners said they believed they needed to get 
Braude to understand their plight before the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 At Thursday's meeting, Grace Lee, one of the owners of the Town House, told 
Braude that the motels could not afford the city condition for an 
eight-hour-a-day, 24-hour-on-call security guard for each motel. Lee said 
security company estimates for such service reached $15,000 for each motel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We support what you are trying to do to get prostitution out of the area," 
Lee said. "But we're living on a day-by-day basis. Our rooms aren't full." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee and the other owners suggested that they might find an alternative 
solution, such as hiring a security service to patrol all the motels on the 
boulevard. However, they were not sure if such a solution could be reached 
before Tuesday's appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Braude praised the motel owners for their efforts to meet with him, but said 
it is up to them to comply with the zoning department action, or come up with a 
reasonable solution of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not my job to make it clear to them what's acceptable," Braude said. 
"That's up to them to figure out." JEFF SCHNAUFER

 A 9-year-old La Crescenta boy -- who played three more innings after being 
struck in the head with a baseball -- collapsed and died several hours after 
the game, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy was scheduled to determine the cause of Timothy Richard Herman's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Lt. Ralph Martin, a friend of the family and a baseball manager in 
the Crescenta Sports Assn. league, said the boy's parents, Robert and Karen 
Herman, doubted that the impact of the ball caused Timothy's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Timothy was wearing a batting helmet when he was struck in the 
head by a pitched ball Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "It glanced off his helmet," Martin said. "He hardly felt it. He ran to first 
base, and then pitched three more innings." 
</P>
<P>
 About three hours later, Timothy complained of pain in his right leg and 
collapsed, officials said. He was rushed to Verdugo Hills Hospital, where he 
was pronounced dead about 11:45 p.m. ERIC MALNIC

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; WORK TO START ON WATER REUSE PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Workers will begin laying the pipeline for a $6-million water reclamation 
project sometime next week, Burbank officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project will include a 17,000-foot-long pipeline that will deliver water 
for landscaping at John Muir Middle School, McCambridge Park, the DeBell Golf 
Course, Stough Park, the Burbank Landfill and the Starlight Amphitheater.The 
water will not be used for drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 The water will come from the city's Water Reclamation Plant, which processes 
the city's waste water. When completed next February, the project will increase 
the amount of reclaimed water used in Burbank by 50%, Burbank Public Service 
General Manager Ron Stassi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reclaimed water is now being used around the city power plant, for highway 
landscaping by Caltrans and around the Media City Center Mall, recycling nearly 
350 million gallons of water a year, Stassi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will definitely mean that more potable water can be used for other 
purposes," Stassi said. 
</P>
<P>
 An official groundbreaking for the project was held by city officials on 
Tuesday morning, but preliminary work has been going on for about a month. An 
existing pipeline that now reaches the mall will be extended to the city's 
hillside neighborhoods. Two new pumping stations and storage tanks will also be 
built, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is being financed by state-backed low-interest loans and revenue 
bonds issued by Burbank's Public Service Department. ED BOND

CHICK URGES APPEAL OF AHMANSON RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Councilwoman Laura Chick said Thursday that she will ask her 
council colleagues to appeal a Superior Court decision that affirms an 
environmental report for the $1-billion Ahmanson Ranch development. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles was one of nine plaintiffs that sought to overturn the 
Ventura County Board of Supervisors' 1992 approval of the 3,050-home golf 
course community on the southeastern corner of Ventura County, near Chick's 
west San Fernando Valley district. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick, whose district would bear the brunt of a massive increase in traffic 
generated by the project, has in the past talked about appealing to force the 
developer to reduce the traffic impacts on adjacent streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But in her March 4 ruling, Ventura County Superior Court Judge Barbara A. Lane 
wrote that in approving the project, supervisors decided that the prospect of 
receiving nearly 10,000 acres of public parkland as part of the deal, along 
with other economic and recreational benefits, "outweighed the environmental 
costs." 
</P>
<P>
 Chick said she hopes that the other plaintiffs will join the appeal. The City 
Council has scheduled a private session April 26 to discuss litigation against 
Ventura County on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court decision on Ahmanson Ranch cannot be allowed to stand," Chick said 
in a statement Thursday. "The Ahmanson project must adequately take into 
account its severe impacts on the quality of life in the city of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Chick's major concern is that the project proposes to link Thousand Oaks 
Boulevard in Ventura County with Victory Boulevard in Woodland Hills, 
increasing daily vehicle trips on Victory from 1,250 to an estimated 19,200. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related matter, Chick and Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, a candidate for the 
Los Angeles County supervisor's seat representing most of the Valley, sent a 
joint letter to Harry Stone, new director of the Los Angeles County Public 
Works Department, asking him to reconsider the department's support for the 
connection of Thousand Oaks and Victory boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 "With new leadership . . . in your department and imminent changes at the (Los 
Angeles) Board of Supervisors, we encourage you to revisit this issue," the 
letter said.

CITY ATTORNEY ANNOUNCES PLAN TO CRACK DOWN ON PROSTITUTES; CRIME: THE PROGRAM 
ALLOWS JUDGES TO PROHIBIT CONVICTED HOOKERS, AS A CONDITION OF PROBATION, FROM 
ENGAGING IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES IN SPECIFIC 'HOT SPOTS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new program to curb prostitution on San Fernando Valley streets was unveiled 
by Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn on Thursday, who said it would also 
help cut down on drug trafficking and other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 But civil rights lawyers expressed concern about the program, which allows 
Valley-based uniformed officers to arrest certain prostitutes on a probation 
violation simply for attracting traffic during evening hours. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar program is already in effect in Hollywood. Both programs allow 
judges to prohibit convicted hookers from engaging in certain activities in 
specific "hot spots" as a condition of their probation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It expands the number of cops that can have an impact on prostitution by 
tenfold," said Capt. James McMurray of the Van Nuys Station, which patrols 
crime-ridden areas along Sepulveda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to keep them from returning to the same area where they have already 
got relationships with motel owners and make them go somewhere else where it 
may not be as easy to set up shop," said Hahn, who believes the program will 
also reduce street crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union voiced concerns about the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ACLU maintains that these conditions must be narrowly tailored to meet 
the needs of the society and the needs of the defendant," said Alan Friel, 
staff attorney for the organization. "We're concerned that the policy may be 
over-broad and we'll be monitoring its application." 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn said careful consideration was given to ensure that civil rights are not 
violated. "It's not the Wild West stay-outta-town condition," he said. "We're 
not banishing them from areas on the map, we're just restricting them from 
participating in the precursor to prostitution activity in those areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the old system, police and prosecutors said, convicted prostitutes were 
often able to return to the same profitable street corner and resume business. 
</P>
<P>
 "As it's been for some time, prostitutes have not been afraid of patrol 
officers who needed vice to come in and catch the girls in the act," said Lt. 
John Waters, vice coordinator for the Valley Bureau. "Now, if they see a girl 
in the area, patrol officers can take action." 
</P>
<P>
 With the new program, defendants who are convicted of prostitution in Van Nuys 
Municipal Court will be given maps marked with the areas where they will be 
forbidden to talk to, solicit or accept rides from motorists between the hours 
of 5 p.m. and 6 a.m. During those hours, they will also not be allowed to sit 
in a parked car in those areas with a motorist. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrol officers will be given lists of probationers banned from the areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Punishment for a violation will vary with each defendant's initial probation, 
according to Deputy City Atty. Laura Van Eyk, who works out of Hahn's criminal 
branch in the Van Nuys Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a prostitute originally sentenced to six months probation could 
end up serving six months unserved jail time upon a conviction under the 
program, Van Eyk said. 
</P>
<P>
 The geographical areas in which the restrictions apply are corridors of 
prostitution activity along Sepulveda Boulevard, Sherman Way, Lankershim 
Boulevard, Ventura Boulevard and Reseda Boulevard. The affected communities 
include Canoga Park, North Hills, North Hollywood, Northridge, Panorama City, 
Reseda, Sherman Oaks, Studio City and Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 The maps were drawn by the city attorney's office with the cooperation of the 
Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hahn could produce no statistics on the Hollywood effort, he said the 
program there drove away many hard-core prostitutes, as well as the drug 
dealers who accompanied them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It did have a dramatic effect on the visible streetwalking prostitution 
problem in Hollywood and we hope the same thing happens in the San Fernando 
Valley," Hahn said. "We hope that by reducing the visual streetwalking, that's 
going to reduce a lot of other types of street crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year deputy city attorneys at the Van Nuys Courthouse prosecuted a total 
of 416 prostitution cases. According to Deputy City Atty. Richard Schmidt, the 
number of prostitution cases this year is running 25% higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn said the program could be expanded to other areas of the Valley, 
depending upon its success.

CANYON COUNTRY MAN ARRESTED IN CARJACKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Suspected carjacker Ernest Samudio returned to the scene of the crime Thursday 
just a little too soon for his own good, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Samudio, 28, of Canyon Country, and an unknown male accomplice had taken a 
late-model yellow Honda Prelude from a woman in a parking lot on Soledad Canyon 
Road at Sierra Highway about 5:40 p.m., Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. 
Richard Lichten said. 
</P>
<P>
 Samudio had pushed the woman aside as she left her car and the accomplice 
smashed the passenger's side window apparently to get in quickly from his side, 
Lichten said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, an unidentified Canyon Country resident, told deputies that the 
two tried to run her over as they fled. 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later, Samudio returned to the scene to retrieve his car, and 
the victim recognized him, Lichten said. She wrote down his license plate 
number and contacted the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies spotted his vehicle and followed it to a house in the 27100 block of 
Crossglade Avenue, where they arrested Samudio, Lichten said. 
</P>
<P>
 Samudio was booked on suspicion of robbery and grand theft auto at the Santa 
Clarita sheriff's station, Lichten said. 
</P>
<P>
 The second man was still at large Thursday night, Lichten said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies said there have been few carjackings in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the fourth-safest city in America, you know," Lichten said. "All crime 
is unusual here."

PROUD MEMORIES; '82 DECATHLETES FOUND FRIENDSHIP, SELF-CONFIDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twelve years ago this weekend, eight students from Palo Alto High School took 
their place on the winners' stage as the victors of the 1982 U.S. Academic 
Decathlon.  
</P>
<P>
 That they competed against only 17 other states -- not the 41 that Taft will 
face this weekend -- did not cheapen their success. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, most remember glowing at being called the best students in the 
country and brimming with the possibilities the rest of their lives held. 
</P>
<P>
 Like hundreds of other teams before and since, the 1982 Palo Alto team was an 
eclectic bunch; decathlon rules require that each team be made up of students 
with A, B and C averages. All were smart, but they had varying degrees of 
success in high school and in the next phases of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 There was Julie Inness, the A student who rode a motorcycle as a way of 
expressing that she was more than just a brain. She ended up a college 
professor and just recently published her first book.  
</P>
<P>
 Noga Tarnopolsky was fluent in five languages but felt so displaced by her 
move to the United States from Switzerland that she was close to flunking out 
of school. She found happier times at Amherst College and now works in 
Jerusalem as a speech writer for the Israeli Minister of Communications.  
</P>
<P>
 Team rebel Billy Northway ended one of his competition essays with a quote 
from the punk band the Dead Kennedys: "Ask not what you can do for your 
country, ask what your country's been doing to you." He went to Stanford 
University with a near-perfect score on his SATs and the last anyone knew, was 
working at a Northern California computer company during the week and a muffin 
store on the weekend. His parents are not sure where he is now. 
</P>
<P>
 The other five teams members each went on with life having shared an 
experience they credit for helping them grow as students and as people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Decathlon gave us an achievement to look back on. . . . It gave us a standard 
to keep living up to," said former team member Jacqueline Kowtko, 29, who 
graduated from Harvard University and is finishing up her doctorate in 
linguistics at the University of Edinburgh. "I remember imagining what we would 
be doing in five or 10 years, and I imagined that most of us would end up at 
good colleges and then we'd get jobs doing something great." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Shalah Wolfsohn, who retired from teaching in 1986 but continued to 
coach the Palo Alto team until last year, remembered the process of choosing 
her team. The A-level students were easy picks; what was tougher was finding 
bright teen-agers who, for one reason or another, had B and C averages. Those 
were the students she could redeem academically. 
</P>
<P>
 The three C students included Tarnopolsky, who had moved to Palo Alto a year 
before and was alienated, miserable and increasingly depressed about her bad 
grades. It was her junior year, and she was beginning to think of herself as a 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Northway was another story. He was brilliant but rebellious. The son of a 
Stanford professor, he stayed up all night before his college entrance exams 
watching a punk rock movie and still had a near-perfect score, friends 
remembered. His poor grades, Tarnopolsky said, were a function of his boredom. 
</P>
<P>
 The third C student was Elizabeth McDevitt, a horsewoman and writer who was 
rebellious in a stubbornly quiet way. In the classes she liked, she would get 
straight As. If she thought a class was a waste of time, she did not go. 
</P>
<P>
 The three were fast friends. Northway and McDevitt helped Tarnopolsky out of 
her isolation. Tarnopolsky, who laughed as she remembered McDevitt teaching her 
how to cut classes, would remain their lifelong friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "The three of us, our main concern was how to get out of this hole we were 
in," said Tarnopolsky. "In a society like Palo Alto, when you come from the 
kind of families that we did with parents who were professors and such, it was 
a rebellion to flunk out. But decathlon was a good feeling. It was something 
successful and fun." 
</P>
<P>
 McDevitt, now 30, graduated from Wellesley College, went on to get a master's 
degree in book arts from Mills College and now works as a project editor for 
Apple Computer, overseeing production of computer manuals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember being completely disillusioned with school," McDevitt said from 
her home in Oakland. "Academic Decathlon sort of got me back into it. It got me 
back into studying and helped prepare me for college." 
</P>
<P>
 Northway, the only student on the team not interviewed for this article, still 
keeps in touch with his two former teammates, though neither of the women has 
spoken to him since last fall, when he quit his two jobs and went on his own 
isolated way. 
</P>
<P>
 At Stanford, Northway was actively involved in campus politics and 
participated in sit-ins and other acts of civil disobedience as part of the 
Sanctuary Movement, which helped refugees from combat zones in Central America 
enter the United States. Tarnopolsky recalled coming home for a college 
vacation and being summoned, along with her mother and McDevitt, to bail 
Northway out of a Palo Alto jail. He was wearing one of her Amherst T-shirts at 
the time of his arrest, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Northway enrolled in a graduate program in history at New York University, 
Tarnopolsky said, but did not finish. When she saw Northway last fall, she 
said, he told her that the two jobs would help him save some money so he could 
become a screenwriter. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither she nor McDevitt has spoken to him since. His mother said she has not 
spoken to her son and had no way to reach him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each one of us has his or her own lot in life," Tarnopolsky said. "And 
Billy's hasn't been simple."  
</P>
<P>
 The B students, Simon Hawkins, 28, and Marcantonio Ferrari, 30 -- who both 
graduated from Swarthmore University -- were both remembered by their teammates 
as being quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins, like Tarnopolsky and Northway, was a year younger than most of the 
team, and would come into his own in his second year of competition.  
</P>
<P>
 After college, Hawkins worked as a paralegal in Washington and then attended 
Clown College at the winter quarters of Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey 
Circus. He later served in the Peace Corps in Tunisia and now works as a 
research associate for the National Center for Improving Science Education, a 
think tank in the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrari had a different reason for being shy. Now an anesthesiologist at 
County-USC Medical Center, Ferrari remembers keeping to himself to guard his 
big secret: He was attending Palo Alto High School illegally. Every day, 
Ferrari would cross the border from Los Altos so he could take advantage of a 
Palo Alto program for advanced science students to take classes at Stanford.  
</P>
<P>
 Although he was reserved with his teammates, the competition nonetheless gave 
Ferrari a place where he could make friends, he said. Lest anyone find out his 
real address, he did not spend much time with his peers or go to parties. He 
recalled studying most of the time and using that as an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the A-level students, Kowtko is writing her dissertation at Edinburgh 
University in computer speech recognition. Her work to determine how a word's 
pitch affects meaning, she said, is a step on the road to having interactive 
speech with computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Rickard, 30, graduated from Swarthmore and earned her master's in 
business administration at New York University. She now is an associate dean of 
admissions at Swarthmore. 
</P>
<P>
 Inness, an assistant professor of philosophy at Mount Holyoke University, got 
her doctorate from Stanford in 1989, at age 25. Her first book, "Privacy, 
Intimacy and Isolation," was published in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 She no longer rides a motorcycle. "How we change when we become professors," 
Inness said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still have clippings stuck around somewhere. And when I look back at the 
pictures in the paper, I'm proud I was part of that back then."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; REPORT SAYS GUNSHOTS KILLED INTRUDER, 17

<P>
 An autopsy report concluded that a naked teen-ager who went berserk and tried 
to enter a Lancaster home hours after friends say he took LSD died from 
multiple gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Josue Oswald Morales, 17, was shot twice early Monday morning by Keith Wood, 
the owner of the home in the 700 block of East Avenue J-9 where the bizarre 
incident occurred, after he repeatedly tried to enter Wood's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Homicide investigators said Wood will not be charged in Josue's death. "He was 
acting in self-defense of his home," said Sgt. Stuart Reed. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators, however, will turn over their file on the case to the district 
attorney's office in Lancaster. "Given the circumstances, we should allow them 
to look at it." 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney will be given the file once the coroner's office has 
received the results of toxicology tests, Reed said. Those test results are not 
expected for at least a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Undoubtedly it will show some level of drug ingestion," Reed said. "It's too 
bizarre an incident for there not to be drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Josue's brother and girlfriend, who were with him before he was shot, said he 
had taken LSD, a drug the high school dropout had previously used. 
</P>
<P>
 After hanging out in a vacant field for a couple hours behind Wood's home, 
Josue went into Wood's back yard and tried to enter the house. Wood said he 
told the youth to leave and that he had called police and had a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Josue ignored Wood and kept trying to enter the home through several 
double-pane windows, one of which he finally dove through, nearly severing one 
of his legs, homicide investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood fired three shots at Josue, who at one point during the rampage took off 
his clothes and, saying he was going swimming, dove into Wood's concrete patio. 
</P>
<P>
 Josue died at a Lancaster hospital about an hour after the 1:34 a.m. shooting.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ELECTIONS / SANTA CLARITA CITY COUNCIL; SMYTH 
EDGES OUT KLAJIC BY 16 VOTES FOR 3RD SEAT

<P>
 In a City Council race with about 30,000 votes cast, a retired high school 
district superintendent has edged out an incumbent by 16 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 H. Clyde Smyth was declared the winner over Jill Klajic on Thursday morning 
after 174 outstanding ballots were tallied. 
</P>
<P>
 The uncounted forms were absentee ballots and provisional votes -- those cast 
by residents not listed on their precinct's voting rolls but believed to be 
registered -- turned in to Santa Clarita polling places Tuesday. Seventeen 
other ballots were submitted but declared invalid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now the hard work begins," Smyth, 62, said minutes after watching the vote 
count at Santa Clarita's temporary city offices. "It was an awfully close race. 
I would've liked to have had a much larger turnout." 
</P>
<P>
 Only 16% of Santa Clarita's 65,287 registered voters came to the polls, the 
lowest turnout in the city's six-year history. Each of the 10,426 residents 
could vote for three of the race's 13 candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Klajic, who did not attend the vote count Thursday, said she won't request a 
recount. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let the chips fall where they may," she said. "I don't want to cause any more 
money (to be spent) or trouble.' 
</P>
<P>
 Smyth's victory came 36 hours after incumbents Jo Anne Darcy and Carl Boyer 
were announced as the race's top vote-getters. 
</P>
<P>
 Smyth's election-night lead of eight votes was precarious, with 191 ballots 
needing to have signatures verified. Klajic and Smyth had traded their hold on 
the third seat throughout the evening, and the incumbent was leading in the 
absentee ballot count. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither candidate was predicting victory before the votes were counted 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought if the trend held, we would still win but it would be close," 
Smyth said. "Jill had done stronger than us on the absentee ballots." 
</P>
<P>
 Klajic said she will stay active in Santa Clarita issues, including the fight 
against a proposed dump in Elsmere Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The only council member to support a growth-control measure two years ago and 
a regular advocate of environmental concerns over business ones, Klajic 
expressed concern that the new council will strongly support development. 
</P>
<P>
 Although labeled pro-development in contrast to Klajic, Smyth said he only 
supports balanced growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Darcy easily won her third term in office, earning 5,460 votes or 18.7% of the 
tally. More than half of the voters cast one of their votes for Darcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyer placed a solid second for his third term with 4,216 votes or 14.4% of 
those cast.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MAN INDICTED IN BOMB THREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 60-year-old man who allegedly threatened to put a bomb at Edwards Air Force 
Base was indicted Thursday on federal extortion charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Glen Harmon Baker, a Tehachapi resident, called West Point Military Academy in 
New York on March 27 and said he was going to Edwards to put a bomb there with 
the intent of hurting a security guard, according to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that day, security police who were notified of the threat found Baker 
trying to get on the base, officials said. A loaded magazine for an M-16 rifle, 
but no M-16, was found in Baker's car, as were several small bottles that he 
claimed were nitroglycerin but were not, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker was arrested April 1 and pleaded not guilty to three charges of using 
interstate telephone lines to threaten someone with injury. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-count indictment handed down Thursday by a federal grand jury in 
Fresno stems from Baker's alleged calls to the Army academy, officials say. He 
first called and threatened to bomb the Fresno Police Department, according to 
the FBI. During his second call, Baker threatened a West Point duty officer and 
then called a third time saying he was going to place a bomb at Edwards AFB, 
said the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 For each conviction, Baker faces a maximum penalty of five years in federal 
custody and a $1,000 fine. A trial date has not been set.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; TELECOMMUTING FACILITY OFFICIALLY OPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three months after the Northridge earthquake temporarily severed Santa Clarita 
from the rest of Los Angeles County, a telecommuting facility has opened for 
dozens of employees to avoid the southbound traffic snarl. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's grand opening of the Santa Clarita TeleCenter included 
representatives from its major sponsors, contributing businesses and area 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valencia Industrial Park site has been operating since March 1 but has 
only had all five of its video-conferencing stations operating as of this week, 
according to Gary Johnson, technical adviser for the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 40 employees can use the facility's 20 workstations with IBM computers, 
five private offices, a conference room with 30-inch teleconference screen and 
office equipment ranging from facsimile machines to photocopiers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 earthquake hammered Southern California highways and generated new 
interest in telecommuting, which allows employees to work from a satellite 
location rather than drive a greater distance to a main office. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a whole lot of people who live here who work someplace else," Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clarita Valley Transportation Management Assn. secured two grants 
for the center from Los Angeles County's Metropolitan Transportation Authority 
-- $152,600 for 1994 and $158,300 for 1995.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 1 KILLED IN FIRE AT ROADSIDE HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One person was killed in a Thursday afternoon fire that destroyed one room and 
damaged five others at a roadside hotel across from Magic Mountain amusement 
park, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified victim is described as a male of unknown age whose body was 
badly burned in the blaze, which broke out shortly after 2 p.m. on the first 
floor of the Ranch House Inn in the 27400 block of Tourney Road, said Inspector 
Mario DeFina of the Los Angeles County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 firefighters battled the blaze at the two-story structure for about 
20 minutes before bringing it under control, DeFina said. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage was estimated at $140,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the fire is being investigated by arson investigators from the 
County Fire Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, DeFina 
said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: EAST VENTURA COUNTY; 
EARTHQUAKE AID IS CRITICIZED AS TOO SLOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly three months after the magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck a sleeping 
Southern California, federal emergency aid is reaching most Ventura County 
victims, disaster officials and aid recipients say. 
</P>
<P>
 But some residents of Simi Valley and Fillmore -- the Ventura County 
communities hardest hit by the quake -- are still fighting with federal 
officials for the aid they say they expected long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley resident Mike Piper, for example, isn't sure which was more 
upsetting -- the earthquake that wreaked $60,000 worth of damage on his home, 
or the following weeks spent wrangling with federal disaster officials, trying 
to glimpse one penny of the emergency aid they promised him in late January.  
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'You've got to understand, we've got 400,000 of these cases,' " he 
said. "I said, ' You've got to understand, I can't live in my house.' "  
</P>
<P>
 But representatives of the Federal Emergency Management Agency say the 
efficiency of their response and the friendly attitude of their employees have 
won them satisfied customers across Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had people come in here, bringing us candy and cakes," said Joe 
Garriga, FEMA's spokesman in Fillmore.

TAYLOR IS HONORED BY KINGS; HOCKEY: SEASON-ENDING 2-2 TIE WITH OILERS MARKS 
FAREWELL APPEARANCE FOR WING AFTER 17 SEASONS IN LOS ANGELES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The perfect and proper ending for Dave Taylor should have been one final trip 
around the Forum ice, hoisting the Stanley Cup high above his head. 
</P>
<P>
 But even though the Cup barely eluded Taylor's grasp, the conclusion of his 
17-season career with the Kings was greeted Thursday with warmth and admiration 
befitting a Los Angeles sporting icon in a ceremony before the Kings' 2-2 tie 
with the Edmonton Oilers in the season finale. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, who officially announced his retirement on Tuesday, was honored in 
pregame festivities and received a lengthy standing ovation from the sellout 
crowd of 16,005. Among those present for the on-ice ceremony were Taylor's 
wife, Beth, and daughters, Jamie and Katie, and his parents, Andy and Margaret. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was real nice; I sort of got choked up out there," Taylor said. "It meant 
a lot to me to go out there and thank the fans. It's something I'll always 
remember." 
</P>
<P>
 He has delivered many memorable moments in his 17 seasons in Los Angeles. 
Taylor was the final member of the Kings' vaunted Triple Crown line to retire, 
and he leaves with 1,069 points and 431 goals. The 38-year-old's retirement was 
hastened by a series of concussions, the last occurring on Jan. 4 after a 
collision with teammate Warren Rychel. 
</P>
<P>
 But Taylor was able to make one final appearance. He took the opening faceoff 
against Oiler center Jason Arnott, a 19-year-old. Taylor won it and the game 
was stopped. The puck was retrieved by teammate Luc Robitaille and Taylor shook 
hands with his teammates. The Oilers on the ice congratulated him too. For no 
apparent reason, the Forum public address system played Billy Idol's "White 
Wedding." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor said he was nervous because he had to speak to the crowd and thoughts 
of his Triple Crown linemates -- Marcel Dionne and Charlie Simmer -- were 
running through his head. He didn't skate in the pregame warmup and left his 
knee brace in the dressing room. "I can officially say my career is complete, 
someone cut the laces of my skates before the game," he said, smiling. "That's 
never happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the Kings (27-45-12) were unable to send Taylor off with a 
victory. But their season has been one long string of disappointments. They 
finished 22nd overall in the NHL and became the first team in 24 seasons to not 
make the playoffs after reaching the Stanley Cup finals the previous season. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the eighth time in 27 seasons that the Kings have missed the playoffs. 
The last time they failed to reach the postseason was in 1985-86, which was a 
54-point season. For the Kings, this was their 16th season with a record under 
.500. King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 At least five King players will be taking part in the World Championships, 
April 25-May 8, in Italy. Defensemen Rob Blake and Darryl Sydor and left wing 
Luc Robitaille will represent Canada. Defenseman Alexei Zhitnik is playing for 
Russia and forward Jari Kurri for Finland. Kurri, however, has been hampered by 
a broken toe since the middle of March. Left wing Mike Donnelly was invited to 
play for the United States and is considering the option. The United States 
squad wanted to invite King right wing Tony Granato, but he has sat out the 
final eight games of the season because of an injured back. . . . Wayne 
Gretzky, who sat out the final three games because of an injured knee, said the 
knee is improving with treatment. . . . With the Kings missing the playoffs, 
attendance slightly at the Forum. There were 32 sellouts in 41 home dates. 
Average attendance was 15,655, down an average of 179 per game from last 
season. . . . King defenseman Mary McSorley was scheduled to have abdominal 
surgery earlier this week in Vancouver, but instead will be operated on Friday, 
the team said. . . . Defenseman Doug Houda had surgery on his injured right 
shoulder Thursday by team doctor Ron Kvitne.

THE PRODIGAL'S RETURN ; SURFER, SNOWBOARDER, FISHERMAN AND ARTIST, TODD 
MARINOVICH WANTS TO BE A QUARTERBACK AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't the Sundays. Todd Marinovich, surfer, painter, idiosyncratic 
quarterback who once dyed his bright red hair black and surfed naked, could 
handle the hulking 350-pound men whose livelihoods depended on leaving him 
crumpled under their massive bodies during games. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't the fun days. Marinovich found the challenge of bonding with 10 
well-trained teammates who counted on him to be an overpowering tonic, as 
overpowering as victory itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was everything (else) that goes along with being a starting quarterback in 
the NFL (that) I was glad to be away from," Marinovich said this week, talking 
publicly for the first time since the Raiders released him Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not Sundays. I could do that Sunday thing forever." 
</P>
<P>
 But when does forever end? It ends unceremoniously on a practice field during 
the heat of Southern California's summer. It ends in frustration and 
disappointment, and yet undeniable relief. It ends after 19 consecutive 
football seasons. It ends quickly, quietly, far from the public eye. 
</P>
<P>
 It ends with a beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Without so much as a word, Marinovich disappeared into the hinterland -- 
surfboard, snowboard, rod and reel, video camera and art supplies in tow. He 
decided it was time to find out what he had missed by playing football since he 
was 5 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Raiders didn't release me, I don't know if I would have released 
myself," he said. "I was at the point where it was almost a pleasure (to 
leave). It was therapeutic, every month and every day of it." 
</P>
<P>
 His family, although disappointed, encouraged him to find himself, to travel a 
new, adventurous path. If he returned an artist, fine. If he returned a surfer, 
well, that was all right too. 
</P>
<P>
 So off he went . . . to Aspen, Colo.; Jamaica, South America and Hawaii. He 
spent peaceful days fly-fishing on Colorado rivers. In the Rockies, he 
reflected on a career that was shaped at Santa Ana Mater Dei and Mission Viejo 
Capistrano Valley high schools, then continued at USC for two tumultuous 
seasons before the Raiders selected him 16th in the 1991 draft.  
</P>
<P>
 Back home, Marinovich concentrated on painting for the first time. Before, 
there was the pressing need to train. The art always suffered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could get as creative as I wanted, without any obstructions like I've had 
my entire life," he said. "And if there was a killer swell that came in, I 
could (surf) and put the art aside for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 That's all he had to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was nice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And now Marinovich has returned. At 24, he is ready for another shot at the 
NFL. But is the NFL ready for him? 
</P>
<P>
 A quarter of the NFL teams needed starting quarterbacks during the off-season. 
All seven made changes, none that included Marinovich. And with spring 
mini-camps coming up, it is getting late to learn a new system. Yet, Marinovich 
says he will decide where to play by June. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the great thing about what I do," he said. "There's just not a lot of 
people who can do it. And I don't think there are that many good ones." 
</P>
<P>
 Marinovich, who started seven games in his second full season with the 
Raiders, has the potential to develop into an outstanding quarterback. But it 
never quite happened in Los Angeles, where Raider officials hinted that his 
off-field behavior, not his ability, was the reason he was demoted to third 
string and then released. 
</P>
<P>
 Marinovich's release did nothing to help an image already tarnished by his 
well-chronicled battles with Coach Larry Smith when both were at USC. When the 
Raiders, of all teams, gave up on Marinovich, others had to wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe (Raider owner) Al Davis would cut a great player," said Larry 
Lacewell, director of college scouting for the Dallas Cowboys. "If Charlie 
Manson could throw the ball, he'd keep him." 
</P>
<P>
 Said another NFL insider: "The Raiders are considered to be the most tolerant 
franchise when it comes to personal peccadilloes, troubled lives, and if he 
couldn't make it with them, where could he make it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Marinovich says little about why he was released. Before the Raiders told 
Marinovich he was gone, Davis tried unsuccessfully to reach Todd's divorced 
parents, Marv and Trudi. It was a courtesy from an old friend. Instead, Davis 
found Todd's grandfather, Henry Fertig, in the press box at the Coliseum.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've known Todd since he was a kid," Davis told Fertig. "He used to play with 
my kid. (But) I'm going to cut him. He's been missing meetings, not doing what 
he is supposed to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Fertig asked if the problem was drug-related. Rumors had shadowed Marinovich 
since January of 1991, when he was arrested for possessing cocaine and 
marijuana. The charges were dropped after he had completed a one-year 
counseling program for first-time offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said drugs weren't a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "His situation was whether or not he was going to be able to make himself 
responsible to the profession and to his career," said Steve Ortmayer, director 
of football operations for the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortmayer said lots of teams think Marinovich is too big a risk. The Raiders, 
he said, tried everything, including counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's had all that," Ortmayer said. "He's had large doses of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Marinovich said he has not experienced a backlash since putting himself back 
on the market. He says other clubs are not concerned about the Raiders. The day 
he was cut, he said, others called. He declined because he wanted time away. 
</P>
<P>
 But even Marv Marinovich, Todd's father and trainer, is surprised by the lack 
of a firm offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something that seems out of whack," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marinovich will not name the NFL teams that have shown interest, saying only 
that he will be playing anywhere from "Saskatchewan to Tampa Bay" next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, he is thinking of Manitoba, home province of the Winnipeg Blue 
Bombers, who hold Marinovich's Canadian Football League rights. Marinovich 
tried out at a Blue Bomber mini-camp in Tennessee last week. With his size -- 6 
feet 4 -- and talent, he has the potential to be successful in the CFL, but 
would be hard-pressed to start in Winnipeg, where Matt Dunigan is the Joe 
Montana of Canadian football. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Winnipeg coaches were impressed with Marinovich's performance -- on and 
off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Todd's done some growing up," said Mike Kelly, the Blue Bombers' offensive 
coordinator. "What I see is a young man who has been humbled, who is looking 
for another opportunity. He realizes he blew it and understands what he has to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Marinovich thinks he is doing it. He has been training in earnest with his 
father three times a week in Laguna Hills, and throwing with former Raider 
teammates on other days. 
</P>
<P>
 After he left the Raiders, Todd had little contact with Marv, the man who 
molded him into a pro-style quarterback from the crib. Marv said last January 
he did not know his son's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've tried to stay away and let (Todd) handle his own situation," Marv said 
at the time. "I just felt it would be better if he just started making those 
decisions and doing what he's going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The hands-off approach seems to have worked. Marinovich said he returned to 
his father's system because it is like returning to basics. 
</P>
<P>
 "By now, I know what's best for this body," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marv said his son has been more focused than in years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like being around him when he's like this," he said. "It is like he was 
when he was a kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Todd: "I feel good about myself. I do." 
</P>
<P>
 Subtle changes have shaped Marinovich's apparent transformation. He cannot 
pinpoint the defining moment but recalls a recent life-threatening experience 
on Oahu's North Shore as at least a lesson in survival, if not perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 After hooking up with professional body board rider Matt Allen, an old buddy 
from Mater Dei, Marinovich was challenging some of Hawaii's famous winter waves 
last January instead of testing NFL secondaries. One day he and Allen paddled 
out at a favorite North Shore break known as Off-the-Wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "This set (group of waves) popped up out of nowhere, and I couldn't make it 
out so I had to bail the board and was caught on the inside (of a wave) without 
a board to use as a flotation," Marinovich said. "Matt was up over the waves 
yelling at me, 'Paddle that way.' (The current) sucks you right down to 
Pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I knew it, I was looking up at these 12-foot waves. Right at Back Door 
(Pipeline) getting hit on the top of the head. Panic was about to set in and my 
legs started cramping. I finally hit the reef and had some leverage to push my 
way to shore. It was the (most scared) I've ever been. I think back on it, how 
you can be here one minute, gone the next. It's good for you." 
</P>
<P>
 At least, it was good for Marinovich, the one-time quarterback prodigy. It was 
good for the soul, good for him to realize how fleeting life can be. And how 
much fun football is. 
</P>
<P>
 It was never the Sundays.

OH, BROTHERS! YOUNGER GROFF, ROBBIE, MOVES UP TO INDY CARS, JOINS MIKE IN LONG

<P>
 For 23 years, the Groff brothers of Northridge, Mike and Robbie, have been 
racing and winning in a variety of vehicles, but they have never raced one 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike is (almost) four years older than Robbie, so when they were little, they 
were racing in different classes and we purposely kept them apart," said Howard 
Groff, their father. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt it would be time enough when they got to Indy cars. Now it's here."

 Mike, 31, and Robbie, 28, are entered in the 20th Toyota Grand Prix of Long 
Beach and will be on the track today for qualifying. The 165-mile race through 
the seaside streets will be run Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be Robbie's first Indy car race. After four years of racing Indy 
Lights, the younger Groff found enough sponsorship to run two races on the 
major league circuit, Long Beach and Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously, it was the Northridge earthquake that led to his finding financial 
support from the Calavar Corp. in Waco, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our family businesses (Northwest Excavating and Northridge Equipment) were 
both hit hard by the quake, but as far as I'm concerned personally, I guess the 
quake proves the old adage about every cloud having a silver lining," Robbie 
said. "All of the equipment we own was rented for the clean-up so we had a 
meeting with the Calavar people -- they manufacture all sorts of booms and 
lifts -- about purchasing some additional equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somehow the conversation turned to racing and the next thing I knew, I had 
some sponsorship money for Long Beach and Portland. I suppose it's fair to say 
that I wouldn't be racing this week in an Indy car if it weren't for the 
Northridge quake." 
</P>
<P>
 Robbie will be driving a 1993 Penske-Ilmor, which he calls "the best year-old 
car around," for Tony Bettenhausen. It is the same car that Paul Tracy drove 
for Roger Penske in winning at Laguna Seca last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really happy for Robbie," said Mike, a veteran of 39 Indy car races over 
the last four seasons. "He earned his chance, and Long Beach will be a good 
place for him to get his feet wet. We've both led a lot of laps there (in 
supporting races), although we've never won." 
</P>
<P>
 Robbie finished second twice at Long Beach, once in a Super Vee and once in an 
Indy Light. Mike has three seconds, twice in Super Vees and in 1989 in Indy 
Lights, the year he won the series championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike, who spent last season testing the new Honda Indy car engine for the 
Rahal-Hogan team, will drive a 1994 Lola powered by a turbocharged V8 developed 
by Honda Performance Development, Inc., in Santa Clarita. He finished eighth in 
the season opener in Australia and was sixth last Sunday in Phoenix -- his best 
Indy car finish. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Honda engine passed its oval test (at Phoenix) in good shape, but at the 
moment, I think it is better suited for a street circuit like Long Beach," Mike 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was chosen as No. 2 driver by Bobby Rahal, three-time Indy car champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike is an ideal team player," Rahal said. "I watched him for several years 
before we signed him. I was impressed for several reasons. He stays out of 
trouble and he does a good job in pressure situations. It was a tough job we 
asked him to do last year, testing the new engine, and he did everything we 
asked with no complaints." 
</P>
<P>
 To be closer to the team, Mike and his wife, Pamela, moved to Columbus, Ohio. 
This will be his first full-time Indy car season after a checkered career 
driving for Dick Simon, Euromotosport, A.J. Foyt and Derrick Walker. 
</P>
<P>
 Groff, driving for Walker in 1992, received praise for qualifying a car for 
the Indy 500, then turning it over to Scott Goodyear, the team's contract 
driver, after Goodyear had been bumped from the field. Goodyear finished second 
to Al Unser Jr. in the closest Indy 500 finish. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Mike was 10 and Robbie 6 when they were introduced to racing by their father, 
who had been a hot-rodder at the old San Fernando drag strip. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dad always told us that he had the hottest car in the valley when he was in 
high school," Robbie recalled. "I can't remember when we weren't racing or 
working on our cars. Nights, when he got home from work, Mike and I would go 
out in the garage and help him with the mechanical work. Weekends, we'd go 
racing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a track in Northridge right near where we lived. We'd go over there 
the way Little Leaguers go to the ballpark. Summers, we'd pack up and head out 
for the Grand Nationals. We went all over the country. Sometimes Mike and I 
would be in as many as six classes in the same event." 
</P>
<P>
 Robbie won eight state and national quarter-midget championships. Mike 
branched out to full midgets at Ascot Park, where he was voted rookie of the 
year in 1981 and most improved driver in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the brothers' early racing was a family operation. Their father was 
chief mechanic and their mother, Susan, was a timer and scorer and served as 
president of the Quarter-Midget Club in the early days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked a lot of hours building up my business, and I wanted the rest of the 
time to be with the family," Howard Groff said. "I loved cars, and right from 
the start it was easy to see that the boys loved them, too, so racing became 
our passion . . . and we never had to worry about where the boys were." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard is proud that his racing sons have moved up to Indy cars, but he has 
one reservation about their success. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up until last year, I did all the mechanical work on the quarter-midgets, 
go-karts, Formula Fords, midgets and Super Vees, whatever they were driving," 
he said. "Then last year, both of them were on teams with professional 
mechanics and there was nothing for me to do. Frankly, I'm bored." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, the senior Groff will be back as part of the Bettenhausen team. He'll 
be handling the pit board for Robbie. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, the Long Beach Grand Prix will be the first time Mike and Robbie 
have met in the same race, but 18 years ago they were on the track in 
Northridge at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was 10 and Mike 14 and when there weren't enough karts for two races, the 
officials combined the field," Robbie said. "Of course, Mike was in a heavier 
class, but late in the race I was leading (in class) and had another guy right 
on my tailpipe. I came up behind Mike and decided to lap him. I knew I 
shouldn't do it -- it was a risky move -- but I knew it was my brother and he 
wouldn't wreck me, so I dove under him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won, but as soon as we finished, Mike grabbed me by the shirt collar and 
said, 'Don't you ever do that to me again. If you try it again, I'll kill you.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Mike only smiled when reminded of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has the bragging rights, I guess," he said. "But don't forget that with 20 
horsepower engines, weight makes a big difference and we were in different 
weight classes."

CLIPPERS' 150-101 NIGHTMARE ALL TOO REAL; PRO BASKETBALL: WEISS GETS EJECTED 
EARLY TO NO AVAIL AS SEATTLE BOASTS RECORD 10 DOUBLE-FIGURE SCORERS IN VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Seattle SuperSonics must have seemed like the Clippers' worst nightmare in 
becoming the first team in NBA history to have 10 double-figure scorers in one 
game as they recorded the highest point total of the NBA season in a 150-101 
rout on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Detlef Schrempf scored 21 points to lead the scoring barrage for the 
SuperSonics, who moved a step closer to clinching the best record in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Coach Bob Weiss called two timeouts in the first four minutes of the 
game. That didn't slow down the SuperSonics, so Weiss left early when he was 
called for two technicals by referee Tommy Nunez and ejected with 6:31 left in 
the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The SuperSonics blanked the Clippers for 6:22 of the first half as Seattle 
went on a 17-0 run, stretching a 34-15 lead to 51-15 before Mark Jackson's 
basket. 
</P>
<P>
 The SuperSonics, 2 1/2 games ahead of Houston for the best record in the 
league, used a 33-5 run over an 11-minute span of the first and second quarters 
to build a 78-42 halftime lead. The Clippers never got closer than 30 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 The point total was the most since the SuperSonics scored 154 in a 
five-overtime loss to the Milwaukee Bucks on Nov. 9, 1989. The previous high in 
the NBA this season was 146 by Golden State against Minnesota on April 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Dehere scored 22 points for the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 The others in double figures for Seattle were Vincent Askew with 18, Shawn 
Kemp with 17, Kendall Gill with 16, Chris King with 15, Gary Payton with 14, 
Michael Cage and Nate McMillan with 12 each, Steve Scheffler with 11 and Ervin 
Johnson with 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The Philadelphia 76ers had nine players in double figures on Dec. 30, 1977 
against Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of good players that don't get much of an opportunity to play," 
Seattle Coach George Karl said. "Sheff (Steve Scheffler) was great out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheffler's layup on a feed from Chris King with 8.4 seconds left made him the 
10th SuperSonic to score in double figures. His teammates had told him to get 
open. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle also had 20 steals -- six apiece by McMillan and Payton -- and scored 
24 points off 25 Clipper turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle shot a season-best 62% from the field in winning its 13th game in 14 
outings. The SuperSonics equaled their season high with 41 points in the third 
quarter when they made 18 of 25 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew that if we had a good start, they might fold it up and go home 
early," Schrempf said.

EMBATTLED MCNALL SUED IN BACK RENT DISPUTE; HOCKEY: REAL ESTATE COMPANY SAYS 
KING OWNER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR $290,000 IN MISSED PAYMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The owner of the Century City building where Bruce McNall keeps his offices is 
suing the King owner, alleging that McNall is personally responsible for about 
$290,000 in back rent that was to be paid through a McNall-affiliated movie 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago real estate giant JMB Properties is alleging that Gladden 
Entertainment -- in whose name the offices at 10100 Santa Monica Blvd. are 
leased -- owed $169,954 in rent through February. McNall, who owns 10% of 
Gladden, maintains offices for his sports and other enterprises in the same 
sixth-floor suite described in the lawsuit filed in Superior Court in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Kenworthy, a lawyer who represents JMB, said that no further payments 
have been made since then. Court documents show that rent owed is accumulating 
at $60,500 a month, which would bring the current total owed to more than 
$290,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A McNall spokesman said: "We were surprised to hear this suit was still 
pending. Although we knew of its existence several weeks ago, we were told by a 
representative of JMB that it had been been dismissed. Bruce has neither been 
served a copy of this suit nor has he even seen it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kenworthy said the lawsuit is still pending and the dispute remains 
unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
 The March lawsuit filed by JMB is one of several filed by creditors recently 
alleging McNall has failed to make various payments. Other suits have been 
filed by two banks and Hollywood studio Twentieth Century Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 JMB claims in the lawsuit that its total damages exceed $5 million, an amount 
calculated by adding future rent and other fees allegedly owed under the 
contract for the 22,864 square feet of office space. JMB says that McNall 
personally guaranteed in writing that the rent would be paid. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall has maintained that he has reduced his stake in Gladden from 50% to 
10%, and is uninvolved in the movie production company's operations. His 
longtime partner in the venture has been one-time studio chief David Begelman, 
who now works through a similarly named company called Gladden Productions. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Hollywood's three major guilds went to U.S. Bankruptcy Court 
seeking to liquidate Gladden, alleging that actors, writers and directors are 
owed about $4.1 million in residuals. On Thursday, the guilds went to court 
seeking authority to question Begelman and review Gladden Entertainment 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, there had been expectations that the sale of 65% of the Kings by 
McNall to telecommunications entrepreneur Jeffrey P. Sudikoff and associate 
Joseph Cohen would close by today. That apparently will not happen until next 
week and the sides "are still working on it," according to a Sudikoff 
spokesperson. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the $60-million transaction are nearing completion. This move will 
help McNall shed a loan with Bank of America, which had extended him $90 
million in loans and credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudikoff and Cohen were interviewed last week by NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman 
in Los Angeles, one of the final remaining steps toward closing the deal. The 
sale needs to be approved by 75% of the league's Board of Governors.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; PARK LACKS CONTROL BUT STAYS CONFIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON , Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chan Ho Park made his second appearance of the season Thursday, and, as in the 
first, he struggled with his control. 
</P>
<P>
 Park entered the game at the start of the fifth inning with the St. Louis 
Cardinals ahead, 6-1, and gave up a run, a hit and two walks and hit Luis 
Alicea on the leg with a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 In the sixth, he gave up a leadoff single to Todd Zeile before Brian Jordan 
hit a two-run homer. He retired the next five batters before pitching out of a 
jam with runners on first and second. 
</P>
<P>
 After his first appearance last Friday night in Los Angeles, Park said he was 
nervous. But asked if he was still nervous on the mound, he answered, without 
an interpreter: "No way." 
</P>
<P>
 Park, who has given up a total of five earned runs and five walks in four 
innings for an 11.25 earned-run average, said it is a matter of learning the 
hitters. He said he is used to alternating between relieving and starting, so 
he already is comfortable with pitching out of the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that I don't know the hitters is difficult," Park said through an 
interpreter. "But I'm learning the batters now and getting better because of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Of his five walks, he said: "There is nothing I can do about those pitches the 
umpire felt were out of the strike zone. I will just have to find the zone that 
will make (my pitches) strikes, even if I'm not too thrilled about it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Dreifort has not given up a run in three appearances and 4 1/3 innings, 
but it's his unflappable nature that impresses his teammates. Dreifort pitched 
out of jams in each of the two innings he pitched Wednesday. In the eighth, he 
loaded the bases on his fielding error, a walk and a hit batter, but escaped by 
getting Zeile to pop up to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dreifort is so even keel," Brett Butler said. "He is so calm, it's like he 
has veins of ice. During the second inning of his first major league game, he 
was down in the bullpen eating a hot dog just loaded with stuff on it. And 
somebody said, 'Watch it, you might vomit out there on the mound if you go in.' 
And Dreifort said, 'Hey, I feel more comfortable out there on the mound than I 
do in here.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, when he is warming up to go in, he was asked if he was ready. Another 
rookie pitcher might have got a little nervous and thrown just a few more 
pitches. But Dreifort just said he was ready, and sat down to wait." MARYANN 
HUDSON

LOSS-PLAGUED MEDICAL FIRM BIRTCHER MAY BE UP FOR SALE; FINANCES: SEVERAL 
OPTIONS ARE WEIGHED. THE MAKER OF SURGICAL DEVICES MAY BE ESPECIALLY ATTRACTIVE 
TO TWO COMPETITORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After losing money for the past two years, Birtcher Medical Systems Inc. said 
Thursday it is considering selling all or part of its operations, or attempting 
a recapitalization. 
</P>
<P>
 William E. Maya, president and chief executive of the Irvine-based maker of 
surgical supplies, said in a statement that the company is considering several 
options. 
</P>
<P>
 "While evaluating these opportunities, Birtcher received an offer to purchase 
its Solos endoscopy division, as well as proposals from several different 
groups to purchase Birtcher's . . . physician office product line, Hyfrecator," 
Maya said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the company is also exploring the sale of shares outside of the 
United States or seeking a loan. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the company's statement, over-the-counter trading in Birtcher 
shares was nearly five times the daily average on Thursday. The stock closed at 
$2, down 25 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said Birtcher is most valuable in one piece, and may be especially 
attractive to two competitors: Conmed Corp., a Utica, N.Y., maker of disposable 
medical devices, and Valley Lab, a division of pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer 
Inc. of New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Lab has a license to market Birtcher's argon beam coagulator 
technology, which cauterizes wounds during surgery with a tiny beam of argon 
gas. Mark Matheson, an analyst with Crowell, Weedon & Co. in Los Angeles, 
predicted that Valley Lab would not want the technology to fall into the hands 
of Conmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many manufacturers of medical products, Birtcher has been hurt by tight 
hospital budgets, analysts said. Moreover, they added, the trend in the rapidly 
consolidating hospital industry is toward one-stop shopping for supplies from 
companies with diverse products -- from surgical tools to drugs to intravenous 
therapy equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Birtcher has had declining margins, declining sales and a difficult operating 
environment," said Evan Sturza, editor of Sturza's Medical Investment Letter in 
New York. "This is really too small a company to compete in this marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
 The company said the Solos endoscopic products division, which makes tiny 
instruments for small-incision surgery, in particular, has had declining sales 
and profits. The company also said it has met with obstacles and delays in 
bringing new products to market. 
</P>
<P>
 A product line purchased by Birtcher in December, 1991, for $20 million, Solos 
is worth about $2 million now, said Matheson, who makes a market in Birtcher 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Birtcher, which employs about 220 people in Irvine, reported a loss of $1.3 
million on sales of $20.2 million during the first six months of the year 
ending June 30. In 1993, the company lost $1.9 million on revenues of $42 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it is in negotiations with "strategic parties" concerning a 
sale but would not be more specific. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said a Birtcher sale could fetch anywhere from $3 to $5 a share.

WESTERN NATIONAL TO OFFER PUBLIC STAKE IN REIT; REAL ESTATE: THE ORANGE-BASED 
APARTMENT DEVELOPER AND MANAGER PLANS TO SELL 8.3 MILLION SHARES AT $20 EACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Western National Group, the largest apartment developer and manager in Orange 
County, expects to offer investors an estimated $167-million stake in a real 
estate investment trust, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission 
filing. 
</P>
<P>
 The privately held company, which has more than $1 billion in assets and 
27,000 apartment units under management, said it hopes to sell its REIT this 
year. In doing so, it would be following in the steps of other developers, 
including the Irvine Co., which sold most of its apartment business to outside 
investors last year in a successful $200-million public offering. 
</P>
<P>
 In its SEC filing, Western National, based in Orange, said it expects to sell 
as many as 8.3 million shares at a projected price of $20 apiece. Its 
underwriters would be New York investment bank Morgan Stanley & Co. and 
Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the REIT market is volatile, the actual price of the Western National 
shares would probably vary from the projected price, depending on when the 
issue comes to market. The shares would trade on the New York Stock Exchange 
under the symbol WNG. 
</P>
<P>
 The company plans to use the proceeds of the offering to repay debt and 
purchase properties for more apartment construction, the filing states. 
</P>
<P>
 Western National had a 1993 profit of $10.2 million, compared to earnings of 
$10.5 million in 1992, the filing states. The company attributed the 2.9% 
income drop to an increase in operating expenses and a decrease in revenue, 
which fell to $80.7 million from $81.7 million in 1992. 
</P>

 Before the REIT can be approved by the SEC, the state Department of 
Corporations must approve a proposal by the company to consolidate the assets 
and liabilities of its 65 existing partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 REITs, which offer developers a way to raise capital, have been popular 
recently on Wall Street. The appeal for investors is that REITs can pass on 
most of their income to shareholders without being taxed, though the higher 
returns also mean greater risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said Thursday that the Western National REIT, depending on how it is 
structured, should be well received by investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The REIT market is still very responsive," said Mike Kirby, a principal with 
Green Street Advisors, a Newport Beach research firm that tracks REITS. 
</P>
<P>
 "By most measures, Western National will stack up well in terms of expertise. 
The issues around this deal will pertain to structure and pricing." 
</P>
<P>
 The REIT would own and operate 71 multifamily housing properties with 10,489 
units in Southern California, 79% of them in Orange County, according to the 
filing. The company said 94.7% of those apartments are now occupied. Western 
National would continue to manage for third parties 87 properties with 16,150 
apartment units. 
</P>
<P>
 The new company also would purchase land in Southern California and build 
seven more apartment communities, adding 1,800 units, according to the filing. 
The REIT also might purchase a general-partner stake in a 316-unit multifamily 
property now being developed in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 60% of Western National's apartments are in northern Orange County, 
where the scarcity of undeveloped land and growth limitations "present an 
excellent opportunity to increase rental rates and occupancy rates," according 
to the filing. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of the company's 71 properties were built in the 1970s, and a few 
were built in the 1960s. The properties range in size from 30 apartments to 
500, with the average being 148 units. All 940 employees of Western National 
would be absorbed into the REIT, the filing states. However, Western National's 
home-building arm, Western National Homes, would not be included. Western

IRVINE APARTMENT COMMUNITIES REPORTS QUARTERLY PROFIT; REAL ESTATE: RESULTS ARE 
UP FROM $1.6 MILLION TO $1.8 MILLION. IRVINE CO. IS TRUST'S BIGGEST HOLDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 At its very first shareholders meeting Thursday, Irvine Apartment Communities 
Inc. reported a profit of $1.8 million for the first quarter ending March 31, 
up from the previous year when the company's income was $1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The real estate investment trust, which has 43 apartment communities with 
11,300 units in Orange County, reported quarterly revenue of $32.3 million, a 
5% increase. For the same period last year, the REIT posted a profit of $1.6 
million on revenue of $30.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 First-quarter funds from operations, a widely used measure of REIT 
performance, came to $12.2 million, or 40 cents a share, for the latest 
quarter, compared to $11.7 million, or 39 cents a share, for the first three 
months of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The REIT has started construction on one of five new apartment projects it is 
planning, and those additions will increase its size by more than 2,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Irvine Apartment Communities can continue this pace, given the large 
inventory of land on the (Irvine Ranch)," said Donald Bren, owner of the Irvine 
Co., Orange County's largest landowner and holder of a majority stake in the 
REIT. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe we have built the best apartments in America, and they are located 
in the most desirable locations in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Apartment Communities began selling shares to the public on Dec. 8 and 
raised $187 million with its initial offering. Although REITs involve some risk 
for investors, they are advantageous because they can pass most of their income 
on directly to shareholders without being taxed. 
</P>
<P>
 For all of 1993, the company had revenue of $124.8 million, compared to $121.2 
million for 1992. Average rents for Irvine Apartment Communities' apartments 
was $963 a month for 1993, up from the previous year's average of $950. Irvine

BRIEFCASE: AUTOMOBILES; FIERO OWNERS CLUB'S NEW HEADQUARTERS FEATURE A 
2,000-SQUARE-FOOT MUSEUM 
</P>

<P>
 The short-lived Pontiac Fiero (General Motors made only 1984 through 1988 
models) did not sell well enough to keep Pontiac officials happy, but it sure 
seems to have made fans of many of its owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Pontiac built 375,000 of the mid-engine, two-seat, wedge-shaped sport coupes 
before discontinuing production. About 2,000 of the people who bought them are 
paid-up members of the Fiero Owners Club of America -- founded in 1983 by 
enthusiast Phil Huff and headquartered in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Lots of automotive nameplates have fan clubs, but Huff has transformed the 
Fiero club into a going parts and accessories business as well. Club members' 
$29 annual dues get them a membership, a quarterly magazines and access to 
Huff's catalogue of Fiero goodies. 
</P>
<P>
 And now they've got a Fiero museum as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Expansion of the Santa Ana Freeway has forced the club out of its 
3,000-square-foot facility in Orange, and Huff has moved to a 7,000-square-foot 
building near Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The new headquarters of the Fiero Owners Club, at 2165 S. Dupont Drive, Unit 
1, Anaheim, include a 2,000-square-foot museum, a picture gallery with 2,500 
square feet of wall space covered with Fiero-related photos and advertising 
art, club offices and magazine production facilities as well as a 
3,500-square-foot warehouse that serves Huff's $200,000-a-year parts business. 
</P>
<P>
 For the grand opening April 30, the museum will have six cars on display, 
including a 1984 Fiero Indianapolis 500 pace car with only seven miles on the 
odometer, a 1988 top-of-the-line Formula Fiero made especially for Huff and 
signed on the chassis by 350 workers at the plant, and a Fiero from Colorado 
that has undergone an engine transplant and now sports the 325-horsepower, 
supercharged Quad 4 engine that Pontiac would have made available if it had 
kept building the cars.

 Dwindling Dealerships: In the things-that-should-not-be-overlooked department: 
Orange County's recession has not been kind to the automobile retailing 
industry. There are 116 new-car dealerships in the county today, down from 149 
in April, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 That represents the loss of some 2,900 jobs for sales agents, managers, parts 
specialists, mechanics and other dealership employees whose total wages and 
benefits would have pumped about $82.5 million a year into the economy, said 
Kevin Allen, director of the Orange County Motor Car Dealers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 On the bright side, the 116 dealerships that are left each employ an average 
of 90 people -- almost 10,500 jobs -- and sell about 2,000 new and used cars a 
year -- 232,000 total, Allen estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 The dealerships have gross combined annual revenue of almost $3.5 billion, or 
$30 million each, and their combined payrolls approach $300 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big business," Allen said.

KOLL REAL ESTATE GROUP SUED OVER $20.8-MILLION TAX LIABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Abex Inc. and Wheelabrator Technologies Inc. has sued Koll Real Estate Group 
of Newport Beach for allegedly failing to contribute $20.8 million to a recent 
tax settlement with the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed in Delaware Chancery Court, contends that the three companies 
-- all formerly affiliated with Allied-Signal Inc. -- had an agreement to 
jointly settle a federal income tax dispute.Abex and Wheelabrator, both based 
in Hampton, N.H., contend in the suit, filed late Tuesday, that Koll is making 
"an eleventh-hour effort to avoid payment." Wheelabrator is now a subsidiary of 
WMX Technologies Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit says the settlement, which was announced March 24, requires the three 
companies to pay $72 million to the IRS. Abex agreed to pay $21.5 million and 
Wheelabrator $29.8 million, the suit says. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit asks the court to force Koll Real Estate to make the $20.8-million 
contribution to which it allegedly agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Koll Real Estate officials weren't available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit says the tax dispute stems from the early 1980s, when Abex and 
Wheelabrator were part of Henley Group Inc. Allied-Signal spun off Henley Group 
in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Koll Real Estate assumed tax liability in the settlement after it took over 
management of Signal Landmark Properties, formerly part of Allied-Signal, in 
1990, an Abex spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit describes the tax settlement as a disentangling of tax liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "At each step along the road to independence, the parties and their 
predecessors faced the thorny issue of allocating tax liabilities," the suit 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Koll Real Estate Group's principal assets include the Bolsa Chica property in 
an unincorporated coastal area next to Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheelabrator provides pollution-control services to industrial markets. Abex 
is a maker of industrial and aerospace products.

REBELS FLEX MUSCLES AS BOSNIA CRISIS DEEPENS; BALKANS: 17 U.N. PEACEKEEPERS 
CAPTURED, HEAVY ARTILLERY RECOVERED. BID TO PROVOKE A SHOWDOWN FEARED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb rebels intensified their menacing of U.N. forces throughout 
Bosnia on Thursday, stirring fears that nationalist hard-liners are trying to 
provoke a showdown with what they see as an impotent, drifting mission. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO jets screeched low over this tense capital in what appeared here to be an 
attempt to intimidate the defiant rebels who have kidnaped, physically 
threatened or restricted the movement of almost 5,000 U.N. personnel in anger 
over recent U.N.-ordered air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebel gunmen crept into a weapons containment site before dawn, captured 17 
peacekeepers at gunpoint and presumably recovered the heavy artillery that the 
U.N. soldiers had been safeguarding. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest U.N. personnel to be taken captive by the Bosnian Serbs include 14 
Canadian troops and three military observers, U.N. Protection Force spokesman 
Maj. Rob Annink said. Their capture heightened concern that the Serbs may be 
plotting to use the peacekeepers as human shields or targets of retaliation in 
the event of further air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian forces also retaliated for the limited NATO bombardments earlier this 
week by shelling U.N. troops and Bosnian civilians in the northern city of 
Tuzla, forcing the command center here to deploy three tanks and a forward air 
controller to the targeted Tuzla airfield, signaling that more bombing raids 
may be in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
 French Cmdr. Eric Chaperon said no requests had been made for what is known in 
military jargon as "close air support," but added that the controller and armor 
were moved forward "to be in a position to do anything that may be necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 In another incident of hostility toward U.N. troops, a French soldier on 
patrol at the front-line Bridge of Brotherhood and Unity was wounded by sniper 
fire, Chaperon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, Serbian forces who had duped U.N. monitors into leaving at least 
one operable tank at their disposal inside a 12-mile weapons exclusion zone 
around Sarajevo moved the armor to another U.N. post in the village of 
Krivoglavci. There they threatened to fire the weapons unless soldiers turned 
over the artillery arsenal under their guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebels also surrounded Russian troops at a second weapons depot in the suburb 
of Hresa to demand back the heavy armaments surrendered for U.N. containment in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels earlier had given up their tanks, howitzers and rocket-launchers to 
avoid threatened NATO air strikes against any artillery left within the 
exclusion zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are not allowed to give weapons back," Chaperon said, when asked what 
orders the encircled peacekeepers had been issued. "That means if the Serbs try 
to get the weapons back by force, our soldiers would have to use force to stop 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 The increasing incidence of hostile acts compelled U.N. officials to 
acknowledge for the first time since the tense standoff developed after Sunday 
and Monday air strikes that the Serbs may be calling the bluff of an 
international community that remains reluctant to intervene with a punishing 
blow. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is happening is unbelievable. It is time to use massive force against 
the Serbs," complained one U.N. official, accusing the mission command of 
putting the lives of troops, aid workers and other foreigners at risk in a 
gamble that the Serbs' belligerence is only posture. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. commander for Bosnia, British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, has described 
the kidnapings, detentions and physical threats to his forces as "an 
administrative matter" he prefers to work out quietly while the more important 
aim of restarting peace talks is pursued. 
</P>
<P>
 Some officers conceded, though, that the severity of the Serbian harassment 
has intensified. 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation is certainly more serious than yesterday. Things are 
escalating," U.N. spokesman Maj. Dacre Holloway said. "It is no longer just a 
case of people restricted to their houses. When shells are being lobbed into 
our areas, like in Tuzla, and people are being taken over, probably by force, 
things are getting serious." 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. and other Western mediators huddled to reconsider their strategy a day 
after Russia's special envoy, Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly S. Churkin, said 
he was close to getting Serbian compliance with a cease-fire in embattled 
Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Western mediators who spent Thursday in Belgrade to consult with leaders 
of Serbia who are believed to have influence over their Bosnian Serb allies 
were to return today to the rebel stronghold of Pale, just east of here. 
</P>
<P>
 European Community envoy Lord Owen and U.N. representative Thorvald 
Stoltenberg were to hold talks with Bosnian Serb leaders. They hoped that the 
sessions would include Yasushi Akashi of Japan, the special representative of 
the U.N. secretary general. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic announced after the air strikes that he 
was breaking all contacts with U.N. officials, effectively scuttling peace 
negotiations, and that his fighters now considered U.N. troops to be 
adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorazde, which was deemed a U.N. safe area nearly a year ago but has never 
been provided with protective troops, was calmer than in most days of the 
Serbian offensive that began March 30. But it continued to be racked by 
small-arms fire and sporadic shelling, Chaperon said. 
</P>
<P>
 One shell fired from Serb-held territory landed on the eastern outskirts of 
the city, killing three children. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly one-third of Gorazde's 65,000 residents and refugees have been uprooted 
by the latest offensive, said Kris Janowski, Sarajevo spokesman for the Office 
of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 He said 18,330 people have flooded into the already crowded center of the 
enclave after fleeing or being expelled during the Serbian encroachment. 
Unknown numbers of sick and elderly had to be left behind as the rebels 
captured southern suburbs and villages, Janowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no way aid agencies could contact or assist those behind the battle 
lines, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a further sign of their emerging isolationist policy, Bosnian Serbs banned

ELABORATE SAFETY MEASURES FAILED TO AVERT DISASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The downing of two U.S. helicopters by a pair of American warplanes over Iraq 
occurred despite a host of systems designed precisely to avert that kind of 
mistake, Pentagon officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The systems, which have evolved with the march of technology since World War 
II, range from the simple to the highly sophisticated, and should have begun 
with a meeting on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under military procedures, the pilots of friendly aircraft flying within the 
same hostile zones are to meet the day before to discuss their missions. Once 
airborne, the pilots could also rely on four different means of radio 
communication. And finally, the jet pilots could have depended upon visual 
identification. 
</P>
<P>
 As the United States set about the grim task of notifying the families of 
those killed in the latest incident of "friendly fire," U.S. military 
investigators began poring over hours of recorded information from the cockpits 
of the two F-15C jets and from the nerve center of an airborne command post to 
determine what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 It is, for the moment, a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 The circumstances of the downing do little to explain the breakdown. The 
F-15Cs' missile attack took place in clear daylight, with an AWACS plane -- a 
sophisticated aerial command post -- in control of operations. 
</P>
<P>
 It occurred in an area that had seen little Iraqi military activity. As a 
result, the air crews involved are unlikely to have been in a high state of 
alert or distracted by enemy forces, as a Navy crew argued had occurred in a 
previous tragic case of mistaken identity -- the downing of an Iranian airliner 
in 1988 by a missile fired from the U.S. guided-missile cruiser Vincennes. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the American commander of the U.N. operation, Air Force Brig. Gen. 
Scott Pilkington, had checked the safety procedures himself the day before 
Thursday's tragic accident -- and apparently found all was in order. 
</P>
<P>
 "Strange things happen," said retired Adm. James Winnefeld of the RAND Corp., 
an expert in the command and control of combat forces, upon learning of the 
accident from a reporter. "Something like this is the result of a breakdown 
somewhere in the system. It's really disappointing because we managed to do 
Operation Desert Storm so well with many, many more opportunities to blow it. 
For something like this to happen under these circumstances is a real tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it appears that several systems set in place to avoid such "friendly 
fire" failed. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Lt. Gen. Richard F. Keller, chief of staff of the U.S. European 
Command, said the pilots of the AWACS plane, the F-15Cs and the Blackhawk 
helicopters should have been "tied in tightly" as a result of a meeting that 
was scheduled to have been held Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In that forum, the details of each aircraft's flight plans -- altitudes and 
times and the radio frequencies they would monitor during flight -- should have 
been coordinated and discussed by air crews that would be in command of planes 
aloft at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Keller said that "as a matter of routine," it is safe to assume the meeting 
was held. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blackhawk choppers were hopscotching from town to town in northern Iraq, 
carrying senior American, French, British and Turkish military officials and 
several Kurdish leaders, according to Keller. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Pentagon officials suggested the choppers may have deviated from their 
announced flight plan, or that the AWACS plane and the F-15Cs may have lost 
track of the helicopters as they made their numerous stops. Under such a 
circumstance, the F-15Cs and AWACS plane could have failed to recognize the 
choppers when they reappeared on their radar. 
</P>
<P>
 But had that happened, the pilots of the F-15Cs, as well as their controllers 
aboard the AWACS plane, should have had other means of determining identity. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the Blackhawks, like all aircraft not directly engaged in combat 
operations, should have been broadcasting a continuous signal of identification 
over an international civil navigation frequency. This "squawking" signal alone 
could have tipped off the combat aircraft to the choppers' identities. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that broadcast, the F-15Cs or the AWACS plane had three other 
electronic signals that they could have used to confirm the choppers were 
friendly. The Air Force planes should have been able to use a sophisticated 
"identification friend or foe" system that sends out an electronic "Who goes 
there?" query. The Army helicopters are equipped with corresponding systems 
designed to respond automatically with a friendly identification message. 
</P>
<P>
 But the systems must be turned on, operating correctly and accurately 
programmed. Under conditions of military tension, including those that may have 
existed above Iraq on Thursday, an aircraft may be presumed hostile if it fails 
to respond affirmatively to such a challenge of a fellow aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 The "identification friend or foe" system now in use aboard U.S. warplanes can 
operate in any one of three electronic modes, all of which should have been 
available to all the aircraft involved in Thursday's incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Military experts, including an experienced F-15C pilot, on Thursday said they 
were mystified that none of the four electronic procedures designed to elicit 
the choppers' identity as "friendly" revealed that vital information. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there is the most low-tech means of identification: the eyes of the 
two F-15C pilots, who are trained to recognize most enemy aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Keller pointed to one feature that may have helped deceive the pilots -- the 
Blackhawk helicopters were carrying external fuel tanks to extend their range; 
those pods appear to heighten similarities between the Blackhawk and 
Soviet-made Hind helicopters flown by the Iraqi air force. 
</P>
<P>
 Procedures such as the electronic signaling that should have taken place 
Thursday helped U.S. military and allied aircraft in the Persian Gulf War 
operate without a single "blue-on-blue," or "friendly fire," casualty. That was 
the case even though hundreds of dissimilar aircraft from several countries and 
many different services operated in close proximity to one another. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, "friendly fire" claimed dozens of casualties among ground units 
in the Persian Gulf; those units operated in the confusion of fast-moving tank 
battles without benefit of identification systems as sophisticated as those 
used by allied warplanes. In the wake of the Gulf War, an Army-led working 
group has sought to improve the procedures and the technologies used to 
distinguish friend from foe. Safety Beacons in the Sky 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. aircraft in the region are equipped with "identification" friend or foe 
systems" that are supposed to alert pilots that they are dealing with American 
aircraft. Beacons at Work 
</P>
<P>
 1. The devices receive and transmit constant electronic pulses. 
</P>
<P>
 2. If a U.S. aircraft wanted to double-check an aircraft's identity, it could 
send a pulse that would query the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 3. A device would then provide a visual indication that they were being 
"queried," and would automatically send back a signal indicating they were 
friendly. What Went Wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 It is possible that one or all of the systems were not working right, or they 
may simply not have been turned on.

GLOBAL TRADE PACT WON'T BE CHEERED BY ALL IN U.S.; COMMERCE: TWO PENNSYLVANIA 
FIRMS EPITOMIZE FEAR OF FOREIGN COMPETITION. ANTI-DUMPING LAWS URGED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and officials of 124 other 
nations gather in Morocco today to sign the most far-reaching trade agreement 
ever written, don't expect a hearty cheer to rise with the searing heat of 
molten steel from the floor of the Bethlehem Steel factory. 
</P>
<P>
 And don't look for an appreciative nod of gratitude in neighboring Allentown, 
where the spick-and-span, climate-controlled workrooms of the AT&T 
microelectronics plant turn 100-pound ingots of silicon into thousands and 
thousands of computer chips every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bethlehem and AT&T are at opposite ends of the U.S. industrial 
spectrum, they have some important things in common: dependence on 
international sales and stiff competition from foreign manufacturers. And both 
grumble that the new trade pact will help their foreign rivals and cut into 
their own business overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 Their complaints may not be serious enough to turn the politically powerful 
steel and semiconductor industries into sworn opponents of the agreement, 
initialed by negotiators from every corner of the globe in December after eight 
years of bitter, divisive talks. 
</P>
<P>
 But they go to the heart of trade politics as it is practiced in the 1990s and 
reflect the narrow, winding path that the Clinton Administration must follow as 
it sends to Congress an international trade plan, which, in its vast scope, 
will dwarf the North American Free Trade Agreement -- only narrowly ratified by 
Congress last autumn. 
</P>
<P>
 Approval by Congress is the only obstacle still standing in the way of the 
global trade agreement. In the end, Congress is widely expected to accept the 
pact if President Clinton can come up with a way to make up for the $11 billion 
or so in import taxes that would be lost over the next five years as a result 
of tariff reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the White House prepares to make its case to the House and Senate, says 
former Rep. William Frenzel, a Minnesota Republican who helped the 
Administration guide NAFTA through Congress, "all of the people with interests 
at stake are trying to get something better. Even those who will profit 
enormously are trying to get one more little thing for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 What the steel and semiconductor industries are trying to get is legislation 
declaring in no uncertain terms that the United States reserves the right to 
take legal action against foreign competitors that dump products on the U.S. 
market at lower cost than they charge at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicle for such language would be the bill that Congress passes to 
implement the new trade pact. Alan Wolfe, a trade lawyer representing the steel 
and semiconductor industries, said that the precise wording of the implementing 
bill is crucial. Until the two industries see the bill, he said, they can only 
say that they conditionally support the international accord. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade agreement, completed in Geneva, would slash import taxes around the 
globe, open markets for food and consumer goods and extend the rules of 
international trade to the growing business of cross-border financial services. 
</P>
<P>
 From a global standpoint, that means "more trade, more investment, more jobs 
and larger income growth for all," said Peter Sutherland, director general of 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Geneva-based organization that 
supervises international trade rules. "Economic operators across the globe will 
benefit. Producers and consumers, investors and traders everywhere will gain." 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, proponents say, the trade pact would boost the gross 
domestic product -- the measure of the nation's goods and services -- by 
anywhere from $100 billion to $200 billion, an increase of 1.5% to 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Although those figures are questioned by some -- economist Thea Lee of the 
Economic Policy Institute in Washington said such numbers "seem completely 
outrageous" -- few question that the trade pact will produce a significant 
increase in global economic activity. And few, if any, industries got 
everything they wanted from the Geneva negotiations, although some are clear 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer manufacturers, aerospace companies and retailers appear to be among 
big winners. Pharmaceutical manufacturers, whose patents have been ripped off 
by foreign companies, are looking forward to protection for the fruits of their 
intellectual labors. 
</P>
<P>
 The probable losers include such struggling, labor-intensive industries as 
textile manufacturing, which fears that the loss of protective tariffs will 
doom it to extinction in the United States within a generation or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere in the middle are semiconductors and steel. 
</P>
<P>
 Bethlehem Steel, despite converting to a high-tech, robot-dependent operation, 
represents the heart of U.S. industrial history, where strong-muscled men work 
amid flame, smoke and the roar of blast furnaces operating at 2,300 degrees 
Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T's semiconductor plant, barely five miles to the west, represents the 
clean, new industry born out of U.S. creativity and a swiftly growing demand 
for computer-driven machinery around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 For all their differences, the steel and computer chip manufacturers agree 
that the new rules of international trade will strip away their protection 
against foreign products that are dumped on the U.S. market at a loss (to drive 
U.S. competitors out of business) or at prices subsidized by foreign 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. steel industry is worried that it will be cheated out of the fruits 
of the last decade of wrenching adjustment as it modernized its plants and shed 
thousands of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today we are the low-cost, high-quality producer in the market," Bethlehem 
Chairman Curtis H. Barnette said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Dumping has little impact on consumers, reducing the average cost of a car by 
no more than $12, U.S. steel companies maintain. But it can kill U.S. companies 
that must drop their prices to meet the foreign competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Frenzel, for one, is unsympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The complaints of the steel companies have been echoing through the corridors 
of Congress for almost as long as we've been making steel," said Frenzel, now a 
guest scholar at Washington's Brookings Institution. 
</P>
<P>
 If the trade agreement makes it easier for steel manufacturers to file 
anti-dumping suits, he said, the chief effect will be to shelter them from 
competition -- a sure-fire formula for industrial flabbiness. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the U.S. semiconductor industry, it has been battling the Japanese 
practically ever since scientists launched the modern electronics revolution by 
learning to etch complicated circuits on tiny silicon chips. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1980s, the vertical conglomerates in Japan that produced a 
particular semiconductor known as a dynamic random-access memory chip flooded 
the U.S. market with their tiny products priced at below cost. 
</P>
<P>
 To fight back, Micron Semiconductor of Boise, Ida., cut its work force in 
half, cut salaries and eliminated benefits, Chairman Steven R. Appleton said in 
a recent appearance before the Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had state-of-the-art technology, high-quality, low-cost manufacturing and 
a dedicated work force, and yet we could not contend with Japanese prices," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the Japanese prices were low enough to knock nine of 11 U.S. 
companies out of this segment of the market, which the Japanese companies now 
dominate. It was only through eventual lawsuits filed under U.S. anti-dumping 
legislation that Micron was able to fight back, now employing more than 5,000 
people at restored wages and benefits, Appleton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A major . . . goal of Japan and its satellites was weakening anti-dumping 
enforcement," Appleton told the committee. "We will not allow this to happen. 
In drafting implementing legislation, this committee must adopt the standard 
that U.S. law be as strong as the new code permits." 
</P>
<P>
 The alterations in the international anti-dumping codes are written in the 
arcane, technical language of trade law dealing with pricing, production costs, 
standards of complaints and profits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The litigators describe it as death by a thousand cuts. The cumulative effect 
of all the small technical changes make it extremely difficult to file an 
anti-dumping case," said Daryl Hatano, vice president for international trade 
and government affairs of the Semiconductor Industry Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, said John Boidock, executive director of the Alliance for GATT Now, a 
multi-industry lobbying group, satisfactory legislation can protect the 
semiconductor and steel industries. 
</P>
<P>
 In Allentown, that means the 3,000 workers at the AT&T microelectronics plant 
can continue turning out thousands of chips destined for answering machines, 
cellular telephones and telephone switching networks. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Bethlehem, where the steelwork's employment is down to 3,500 from about 
10,000 in the early 1980s, 1 million tons of steel will continue to roll out of 
the mills each year.

COLUMN ONE; OUTRAGE MAY REVIVE RAPE CASE; FIVE MEN TOOK ADVANTAGE OF A DRUNKEN 
WOMAN WHO THOUGHT THEY WERE HER FRIENDS. THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AGREED TO 
MISDEMEANOR PLEAS AND FINES OF $750. 
</P>

<P>
 There are men in this world who would enjoy having sex with a drunken woman 
passed out at their feet like some sodden rag doll, and at least five of them 
were acquaintances -- and even friends -- of Krista Absalon. 
</P>
<P>
 They all had been carousing that Friday night at the Casablanca, a popular 
hangout in this isolated town near the Canadian border. Partying often went on 
past the bar's closing time, with the doors locked and the liquor free. 
</P>
<P>
 It had been a lousy week, and Absalon meant a binge to be a wonder drug for 
her troubles. Her boss had not given her the raise she wanted. Worse yet, she 
and her ex were arguing again about custody rights to their two little ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital lab technician began the evening with an empty stomach and then 
went on to fill it with beers and a double shot of rum and a whiskey sour. 
After hours, the amiable, young manager -- Mario Pistolesi -- allowed her free 
belts of alcoholic concoctions known as Kamikazes and Alabama Slammers. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Pistolesi, a friend, who later found Absalon reeling in and out of 
consciousness in the ladies room, with her jeans around her ankles. She kissed 
him, he recalls. He helped her to one of the bar's padded booths, where he and 
the others then took turns with her as they snacked on beer and sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly three years have since passed, but the attack on an incapacitated woman 
has kept this town at the center of a moral cyclone, not so much for the crime 
-- awful as it was -- but for the punishment, which last June was 
plea-bargained against the victim's wishes to a misdemeanor and $750 fines. 
"That's it?" Absalon cried out in court. "Are you serious? Oh, my God." 
</P>
<P>
 In Gouverneur, there was little matching outcry; prevailing attitudes are like 
a wagging finger that suggests a woman who drinks too much forfeits the right 
to say no. But the case has carried across the Adirondacks and come to 
represent nationally so much of what goes awry in acquaintance-rape cases: a 
preoccupation with judging the victim's conduct instead of the perpetrator's. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rape isn't like robbery; rapists somehow get protected by our prejudices, 
with the idea being that the victim deserved it," said Alice Vachss, a former 
New York City prosecutor and author of a recent book about sex crimes. "In this 
case, Krista was drunk. So she wasn't a nice enough victim." 
</P>
<P>
 Absalon has been tenacious, however. Now 26, she has vented her anger and pain 
everywhere she could, making appearances, writing, phoning. And today, a judge 
in Canton, N.Y., will hear some very unusual arguments in a very unusual motion 
by the state attorney general. He has asked that the misdemeanor pleas be 
thrown out and that the original charges of felony rape be reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
 There may yet be a trial in which a jury hears the evidence against the five 
men Krista Absalon once thought of as friends. "All I've ever wanted was my 
fair day in court," she said last week. "Regular, everyday people -- a jury -- 
ought to hear what these men did to me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About 4,300 people live in Gouverneur, and most jobs are in the surrounding 
dairy farms and the zinc and the talc mines. The town has been best-known as 
the birthplace of Edward G. Noble, the inventor of Lifesavers. A car-sized 
replica of "the candy with a hole" welcomes the traffic into downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 While Gouverneur may be an oasis amid expanses of white pine and hemlock, 
there are not many nightspots except for the restaurants and bars owned by the 
Pistolesi family. The Casablanca sold good steaks and homemade pasta. Its bar 
was long and serpentine and the crowd was friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 Krista Absalon's assailants are now known locally as the "Casablanca 5." But 
if there is a common run of compassion in town, it is neither for the victim 
nor the "5" but the genial Italian immigrant who owns the bar, Tony Pistolesi. 
The case has cost his establishment its liquor license. 
</P>
<P>
 Gouverneur's mayor, Donna Scozzafava, is typical of most when she said, 
"Everyone knows everyone else here, and there are some sympathies on both 
sides. But everyone feels for Mario Pistolesi's father (Tony). He's worked so 
many years in the restaurant trade and now he has been made to suffer." 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Pistolesi assesses the crime in terms of lost business and, echoing 
general sentiments, indeed presents himself as a pitiable figure. "I was home 
sleeping and I'm the only one been hurt by all this," he said. "To this day, I 
wouldn't know how (the assault) started or how it ended." 
</P>
<P>
 For quite some time, Krista Absalon was herself in the dark. Two of the men 
had given her a ride home that morning. She recalls feeling wet and sore, but 
attributed that to her menstrual cycle. She said she had no hint of what had 
gone on until 13 days later. A friend had heard talk. The men were boasting. 
</P>
<P>
 To make sense of it, Absalon rummaged through her memory but much of that 
night was only a deep pool of emptiness. "I thought it was impossible, no way, 
these guys were my friends," she said. "I knew them from school and from the 
Casablanca on Friday nights. The idea of it made me an emotional wreck." 
</P>
<P>
 So she phoned the one she felt closest to, Mario Pistolesi. "What the hell 
went on?" she asked him. "People are saying all sorts of rotten things." 
</P>
<P>
 He answered her sternly, she recalled. "Listen Krista," he said. "If you can't 
remember, then nothing happened." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Krista Absalon, however articulate, is not an assertive woman. She was not 
inclined to report anything, but a friend -- a state trooper -- had heard the 
stories, too. He urged her to file a complaint at the state trooper barracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators first questioned bartender Greg Streeter, now 29. He confirmed 
that an attack had occurred, though he initially denied taking part in it 
himself. "I thought the girl was passed out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His statement was crucial. It allowed police to squeeze confessions from three 
of the other four. One was Mark Hartle, now 27. He also comes from one of 
Gouverneur's leading families, working in his dad's construction business. His 
signed statement largely coincides with those of the others. It reads: 
</P>
<P>
 "At about 2:30 a.m., Mario Pistolesi was told by someone that there was a 
woman passed out in the girl's bathroom. Mario went in and brought her out and 
helped her to a booth where she layed down. At the bar at the time was myself, 
Mario, Greg Streeter, Mike Curcio and David Cummings. Everybody else had left 
the bar and gone home. 
</P>
<P>
 "All five of us went to the back and proceeded to remove Krista's clothes. I 
decided to have intercourse with her and I went first. I only had intercourse 
with her for about 1 1/2 minutes . . . I decided not to continue. After I was 
done, Mike Curcio was next. . . . He was followed by Greg Streeter, and then 
both Mario and David Cummings took turns. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "When we were done, we all helped dress her. She was awake now and she had 
regained consciousness several times while we were having intercourse with her. 
We all went back to the bar and finished our beer and sandwiches. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to add a few things. . . . We would stay a few seconds when somebody 
was (assaulting) her and then go into the bar to drink some more. I also 
remember that Greg asked for a beer while he was (assaulting) Krista. I think 
Mario is the one that carried the beer back to him. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I am glad that I am finally able to talk about this as I have felt very 
guilty about doing this to Krista. I would not want anybody to do this to my 
sister." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It would be months before the police made arrests. All the while, Absalon 
ached with self-loathing. "I was a nut case, a psycho, running scared, dealing 
with all kinds of emotions. I blamed myself for a long time. I still blame 
myself. It was stupid being in that bar and getting that drunk." 
</P>
<P>
 She missed a lot of work. She drank heavily. "I had so many questions: Who did 
what and why? I felt betrayed in such a strange way. I would sit in the corner 
of the bedroom and cry all the time. My kids would ask what's wrong, and I'd 
say that somebody hurt me, and they'd tell me to hurt them back." 
</P>
<P>
 The crime had been reported in the local newspapers without using Absalon's 
name, but many people certainly knew that she was the victim. She could sense 
the staring and hear the whispers. "Krista jokes" were circulating. 
</P>
<P>
 One whisper was that the Pistolesis wanted to buy her silence. In an effort to 
verify that, investigators arranged for Absalon to phone Mario as they recorded 
the call. He denied the offer, but their taped exchange reveals two friends 
struggling over one's bad faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Krista: Why did you guys do that? 
</P>
<P>
 Mario: Why do we all do it? I don't know. I'm sorry. 
</P>

 By the time rape charges were filed -- five months after the assault -- 
Absalon had sought help at a rape treatment center 25 miles away in Canton, the 
county seat and a college town. Counselors there were used to rapes where 
people blamed the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case was too painful for some people to believe," said Jennifer Baird, 
who runs the center. "The Pistolesis are a nice family. That goes against the 
stereotype." 
</P>
<P>
 Absalon herself was born in Gouverneur to working-class parents. Her mother 
and two sisters have stood by her from the start. "Women are still suppressed 
here," said one sister, Clover Forsythe. "In the North Country, we're just 
starting to realize there's such a thing as sexual harassment." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the months, Absalon began to feel better about herself. She liked the 
word the counselors used: empowerment. She picked a lawyer from the phone book 
and filed a civil suit against the five men and Tony Pistolesi for $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Empowering as that may have felt, there was an unwanted repercussion. The 
Watertown Daily Times, so scrupulous about not publishing the name of a rape 
victim, went ahead and identified her as the plaintiff in the lawsuit. Gone 
forever was even the pretense of a victim's anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went out to get annihilated, and I drank and I took some pills and I 
would've succeeded in killing myself if I hadn't vomited it up," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A year after the arrests, Absalon was so frustrated with the justice system 
that her mind seemed to be on fire. She had no idea of what was happening. 
Dist. Atty. Richard Manning did not answer her calls. He had never spoken with 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 Elected in 1991, Manning had problems of his own. His assistant who handled 
sex crime cases had recently quit, complaining he had slandered her. A former 
secretary had sued him for sexual harassment, claiming he engaged in "outbursts 
of obscenities" and favored profanity in describing women. 
</P>
<P>
 Absalon did not get word of what was going on until last May. Newspapers 
reported that a plea was in the works, reducing the charges to misdemeanor 
sexual misconduct. That crime -- defined similarly to rape as "sexual 
intercourse with a female without her consent" -- was punishable by no more 
than a year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering such a plea would require some doing. Legally, Manning could not 
bargain a Class B violent felony down to a Class A misdemeanor. He would have 
to drop the first charge and file the misdemeanor charge with a village or town 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
 In rural New York, town judges are elected to handle minor violations. They 
commonly have no background in the law. In this instance, the case was 
scheduled for June 5 before Town Judge Wallace Sibley, a fertilizer salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 With that date set, something of a gasp rippled across the county. Women's 
groups in Canton were outraged. The idea of it -- a misdemeanor! There was talk 
the "5" might get off with only a few months behind bars or even probation. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Saturday morning of the trial, 100 protesters -- mostly out-of-towners 
-- lined the sidewalks outside the Gouverneur fire station, which sits beneath 
the town court. Children held signs marked in crayon: Don't Hurt Girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Sibley was ushered into the building with a police escort. Two of the 
defendants took seats right in front of the Absalon family. "You get the hell 
out from in front of us," shouted Krista's mother. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge warned against further disruptions. He expected order. If the victim 
wanted, she could present an "impact statement" before sentencing. Absalon had 
written one but was too upset to read it. Her sister Clover took over: 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel as if I have fought a losing battle for the last 19 months of my life. 
First, I had to deal with the fact that I was raped by five men -- or should I 
say five animals -- that I thought were my friends. Then came the media that 
slandered me with my name, my family, and then to top it off, I was raped again 
by the law system. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "How come justice can't be served? What in God's name did I do wrong? They 
raped me when I could not consent. I was passed out and they raped me. They are 
pigs. They will walk free to do that again. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Ask them if they have had to go to a counselor every week for the last 19 
months. Ask them if they have a hard time getting out of bed to go to their 
jobs. Ask them if they have to explain to their 4- and 5-year-old children why 
their mother is crying for no apparent reason. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I guess this statement is my last shot of hope, my last cry for the justice 
system that everyone is supposed to live by to finally do what is right and 
discipline these so-called men with something besides a slap on their hands. 
Sincerely, Krista Absalon." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most everyone considered the sentences -- fines of $750 for each of the five 
and $90 more in court costs -- to be startling in one way or another, including 
Judge Sibley. His caseload usually dealt with barroom scraps and speeding 
tickets. He had never meted out this big a penalty, he announced gravely. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone among the spectators answered that by shouting, "That's it? No jail? 
No probation?" Even prosecutor Manning took exception. "I feel that there 
should have at least been a maximum fine ($1,000) and at least a year of 
conditional discharge, if not probation," he told the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning himself could sense the heat. He would soon be under attack and he 
chose to face his critics with bluster. A plea-bargain was struck because 
"there was no corpus delecti, no proof that a crime had been committed," he 
explained. He called reporters "pandering, pustulant press idiots" and claimed 
that Absalon's lawsuit proved "she has dollar signs in her eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten days later, the prosecutor oddly apologized for his outbursts, if not his 
entire handling of the case. He offered regrets "to the victim of this heinous 
crime" for any misconstrued statements about her "harrowing ordeal." He said he 
should have demanded that the "5" get a year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 This solace was late. The sentencing had been a new low point for Absalon. Her 
mood was desperate. "A lot of people were sending flowers to my house," she 
recalled. "It was like someone had died and, when I thought about it, I said, 
yeah, a part of me has died. And the price on it was $750." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Absalons were unwilling to let things settle over the slow drift of time. 
They had support in this from a vanguard in Canton. Angry calls were made to 
the right people around the state. A month later, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo asked for 
a review of the case from a special investigations commission. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, there were some charges of back room deals, but that has not been 
proved. Dick Sterling, news editor of the weekly Gouverneur Tribune-Press and 
himself a town judge, believes the plea was just a matter of too many people 
taking the assault of a woman too lightly. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Judge) Sibley was duped by the big shot attorneys for the defendants and Mr. 
Manning," Sterling said. "They presented everything to him beforehand, and I 
think Sibley honestly felt he was giving out a stiff sentence." 
</P>
<P>
 The gross mismatch of crime and punishment inevitably brought national 
exposure. Last summer, the NBC news magazine "Now" did a segment. The 
defendants have otherwise been publicly silent, but the TV crew was able to 
persuade one, Michael Curcio, to appear on camera. 
</P>
<P>
 He proved an impenitent spokesman. "The truth is it was a gangbang," Curcio 
said. "Gangbangs have been going on since the turn of the century." 
</P>
<P>
 In Gouverneur, this TV program finally flushed out some additional sympathy 
for Absalon. By then, however, most people also wanted the case simply to be 
over. It was time for the town to go back to being the birthplace of 
Lifesavers. 
</P>
<P>
 That desire has been thwarted by the state's intervention. Cuomo's commission 
recommended that a special prosecutor be appointed. Atty. Gen. G. Oliver 
Koppell was named and he made this assessment: The town judge had no 
jurisdiction and the guilty pleas can be legally rescinded. 
</P>
<P>
 In place of those pleas, the state will today ask to reinstate the 
first-degree rape charges. The crime carries prison terms of up to 25 years. 
Prosecutors believe the defendants' confessions are sufficient evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers, for their part, intend to argue that all this violates their 
clients' right not to be tried twice for the same crime -- or double jeopardy. 
They say Cuomo and Koppell are posturing for votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's political grandstanding and they haven't a chance in hell to pull it 
off," said lawyer Gary Miles, who represents Hartle. "Even if a district 
attorney screwed up, you can't just waltz into court later and say that justice 
hasn't been done. It violates every concept of due process." 
</P>
<P>
 There are several possible outcomes, and some of them leave Krista Absalon 
very apprehensive. The guilty pleas could be thrown out without any new charges 
ever being sustained. There is that gamble. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, she is bracing herself for her own day on the witness stand, 
either in a criminal case or the civil suit. "They're going to put me through a 
long, dirty hell," she said. "I'm no nun and I've never lived like one." 
</P>
<P>
 There are plenty of people in Gouverneur ready to throw mud her way. Tim 
Markwick, the bass player in a rock band, said he has already taken one 
attorney on a tour of the bars that have banned Absalon for misbehavior. "I've 
seen her passed out so many times, you wouldn't believe it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlton Yedinak, bartender at the Fore by Four, is a spout for stories about 
how liquor turns Absalon into a vamp. "I've seen her in action, and it's quite 
an act to see," he said. "With a little to drink, she gets pretty free with 
herself." 
</P>
<P>
 He is yet another here who sees what took place in the Casablanca through the 
peculiar refraction that focuses blame on the victim: "No one will tell you 
that what happened to her was right, but c'mon, a girl that drunk, what did she 
expect?"

U.S. MISTAKENLY DOWNS 2 ARMY COPTERS OVER IRAQ; MIDEAST: 15 OF THE 26 DEAD ARE 
AMERICANS. DESPITE GOOD VISIBILITY, F-15S TARGET BLACKHAWKS AS IRAQI CRAFT IN 
'NO FLY' ZONE. PENTAGON IS BAFFLED. CLINTON VOWS TO 'GET THE FACTS.'

<P>
 Two U.S. jet fighters mistakenly shot down a pair of U.S. Army helicopters 
over northern Iraq early Thursday morning, killing 15 Americans and 11 foreign 
officials in an episode that left U.S. military officers baffled as to how the 
tragedy could have occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said the helicopters, both Army UH-60 Blackhawks, were ferrying 
a team of foreign officers and Kurds on a routine visit to remote Kurdish 
villages. They said the pilots of the U.S. jets -- both Air Force F-15C Eagles 
-- somehow mistook the helicopters for Iraqi aircraft despite good visibility. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton expressed "deep sorrow" over the tragedy and pledged to "get 
the facts" to the American people and to U.S. allies. 
</P>
<P>
 The downing of the helicopters occurred despite elaborate procedures 
established by the military to prevent such misidentifications. 
</P>
<P>
 All four aircraft were under the control of an Airborne Warning and Control 
System (AWACS) command plane, and the pilots had rehearsed their duties. 
Blackhawk helicopters also normally are equipped with electronic devices that 
identify them to friendly aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Pentagon officials declined to describe current rules of engagement 
-- for fear of compromising military security -- experts said the jet pilots 
probably were required to receive the approval of AWACS controllers and to 
identify the aircraft visually before opening fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Although indications were that the pilots had fulfilled both conditions, 
analysts suggested that either the pilots had made a mistake in identifying the 
aircraft or had spoken to a different controller aboard the AWACS than had the 
helicopter pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident was all the more startling because the area where it happened -- 
the "no fly" zone from which Iraqi aircraft are excluded under terms set by the 
allies at the end of the Persian Gulf War -- has been quiet for more than a 
year. The last time a U.S. plane shot at an Iraqi aircraft over the region was 
in December, 1992, when a U.S. F-16 shot down a Soviet-made MIG fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thursday's action, both of the Blackhawk helicopters were downed by U.S. 
missiles. One of the F-15Cs used a radar-guided AMRAAM missile, while the other 
used a Sidewinder, which homes in on the heat from its target -- in this 
instance, the helicopter's engine. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said that an American search-and-rescue mission recovered all 
26 bodies, and the U.S. European Command, which oversees allied air operations 
in the region, is dispatching a team of high-level investigators to the crash 
site today.  
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials did not hide their bewilderment over how the tragic mistake 
had occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly something went wrong," Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters at a briefing. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from the human tragedy, the episode was a setback for the military, 
which has been enforcing a "no fly" zone in the region for more than three 
years without major accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 The zone, established by the United States and its allies in April, 1991, was 
set up to protect Kurds in northern Iraq from raids by Iraqi troops. Iraqi 
aircraft are prohibited from flying in the zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's episode occurred in a barren region 35 miles north of Irbil, an 
Iraqi city near the Turkish border. U.S. military teams landed at the crash 
site later and were guarding it while the investigation was under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Military officials said there were no survivors. The recovered bodies were 
flown to a U.S. air base in Turkey. The Pentagon said the names of the dead 
will probably not be made public until today.  
</P>
<P>
 The 11 foreigners aboard who were killed consisted of two Britons, one 
Frenchman, three Turks and five Kurdish leaders. Most of the passengers 
apparently were military officers who were assigned to U.N. military and relief 
efforts for the Kurds. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry postponed a scheduled trip to South Korea 
today because of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry told the Public Broadcasting System's "MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour" later 
that he had ordered interim changes in the procedures used to enforce the "no 
fly" zone that he said are designed to "minimize the risk" until the actual 
cause of the accident is known. 
</P>
<P>
 He said investigators will probably be able to piece together a 
minute-by-minute account of the incident in a few days but warned that it could 
take longer to uncover the underlying problem. "It's clear that there were some 
serious errors made," the secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
 Army Lt. Gen. Richard F. Keller, chief of staff of the U.S. European Command, 
said it was not immediately clear whether the allies will continue their 
patrols without interruption. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials said later that the United States has no plans to abandon 
enforcement of the "no fly" zone, particularly in view of stepped-up harassment 
of the Kurds by Iraqi forces in the last few months. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the "no fly" zone in the north, the allies have set up a similar 
flight ban in southern Iraq, this one to protect Shiite Muslims, who also have 
been the target of Iraqi attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. warplanes consistently have shot down Iraqi aircraft that have violated 
the "no fly" restrictions and have bombed Iraqi radar batteries that have 
targeted U.S. or allied jets while they were on patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not immediately clear why the F-15C pilots mistook the U.S. Army 
helicopters for Iraqi aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry said the two F-15C pilots asserted in interviews later that they had 
positively identified the helicopters as Iraqi Hinds and even listed them that 
way in the reports that they filed after they landed.  
</P>
<P>
 Military officials said the Blackhawks can look something like Soviet-built 
Iraqi Hinds when equipped with extra fuel pods, as they were on Thursday, but 
that the two aircraft still have some distinguishing features. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the two helicopters had been flying below the F-15Cs and 
crashed about 220 yards apart. But they said they would be unable to provide 
other details, such as the altitude at which the four aircraft were flying, 
until sometime today or tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 In Incirlik, Turkey, where the F-15Cs are based, officials said that four of 
the allied officers killed were colonels, while the others were majors and 
lieutenant colonels. A U.S. political official may also have been aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Serchil Qazzaz of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan said that the officials had 
been scheduled to land in the town of Salahuddin for talks with leaders of the 
two primary Kurdish guerrilla groups in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses described the crash site near the city of Irbil as a grisly scene 
littered with the charred remains of aircraft and bodies burned beyond 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurdish officials said they initially believed that the helicopters had been 
shot down by Iraqis. Some said they could not believe that the pilots of the 
U.S. jet fighters could have mistaken the Blackhawk helicopters for Hinds. 
</P>
<P>
 Iraqi activity against the Kurds, which fell off for a while in 1992 and 1993, 
reportedly has intensified. Kurdish groups said earlier this week that they had 
arrested two Iraqi agents with orders to attack the few foreigners still 
helping Kurdish villagers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon said Thursday that it plans to ask military officials of Britain, 
France and Turkey to accompany its investigating team to examine the crash 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 Times special correspondent Hugh Pope in Istanbul, Turkey, contributed to this 
report. Mistaken Identity

 The Pentagon is investigating the downing of two U.S. Blackhawk helicopters by 
U.S. F-15C fighters enforcing the "no fly" zone over northern Iraq early 
Thursday morning. All 26 on board were killed when the fighters fired missiles

 Researched by DAVID F. MONTESINO / Los Angeles Times The Danger Zone 
</P>
<P>
 The two U.S. helicopters downed by "friendly" U.S. fire were traveling in a 
"no-fly" zone in northern Iraq. THE MISSION 
</P>
<P>
 The allies have been enforcing the "no fly" zone with some 70 U.S., British 
and French warplanes based at Incirlik in southern Turkey. The zone was set up 
by the allies to protect the Kurds from Iraqi vengeance for an ill-fated 
uprising after the Gulf War. THE KURD REBELLION 
</P>
<P>
 The Kurds are seeking a separate nation, opposed by Iraq, Turkey and other 
nations where they have sizeable population. In March 1991, after half-century 
of failed rebellions against Baghdad, separatist Kurdish guerrillas rose and 
seized key towns. By April, Baghdad government crushed the rebellion. THE U.N. 
EFFORT 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. Security Council has demanded that Iraq end repression of all of its 
civilians and permit unimpeded delivery of humanitarian supplies. But that 
council demand was not part of the Gulf War cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations carries out major humanitarian relief operations in the 
north. About 200 U.N. civilian police guards are deployed in the north to 
protect humanitarian aid workers there. Accidental Deaths 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 25% of the American deaths in the 1991 Persian Gulf War were attributed 
to "friendly fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Number of U.S. troops killed by friendly fire: 35

HOSPITAL CHAIN AGREES TO SETTLE FRAUD PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 National Medical Enterprises said Thursday that it has tentatively agreed to 
pay more than $300 million to settle federal and state investigations into 
allegations of widespread fraud and other misconduct at some of its hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed agreement would be the largest health care fraud settlement ever 
won by federal officials, who have made a high priority of cracking down on 
costly fraud and other misconduct practices in the medical industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint probe of National Medical was disclosed in a dramatic and widely 
publicized fashion in September when hundreds of FBI agents led raids on the 
company's Santa Monica headquarters and other facilities around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, if completed, would resolve all state and federal civil and 
criminal investigations of the company, National Medical officials said. But it 
would not rule out the possibility of criminal charges being brought against 
current or former National Medical employees. Federal investigators have said 
privately that they were exploring evidence that wrongdoing within the hospital 
company may have been orchestrated by senior executives who are no longer with 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington attorney Charles F.C. Ruff, a former Watergate special prosecutor 
who represents National Medical, declined to say whether the agreement would 
require the company to acknowledge wrongdoing. "All I can tell you," he said, 
"is that the company expects to dispose of all its liabilities -- criminal, 
civil and administrative." 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement follows months of talks between National Medical, the Justice 
Department and the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the 
Medicare program. A National Medical official said Thursday that the company 
has persuaded federal agencies not to bar it from Medicare or other federal 
programs -- an action that could have crippled the company. 
</P>
<P>
 A Justice Department source said the government was "near agreement" with 
National Medical but declined further comment. Health and Human Services 
declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The company had been reeling since 1991 -- before the federal probe was 
disclosed -- from widely reported allegations of insurance fraud and patient 
mistreatment at its psychiatric hospitals. Insurers sued the company, accusing 
National Medical of submitting nearly $1 billion in fraudulent claims. And in 
dozens of other lawsuits, patients and former employees accused the company of 
various misdeeds designed to cash in on patients' insurance benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more startling of those allegations were claims that National 
Medical employees sometimes paid "bounty fees" of up to $2,000 a patient to 
probation officers and clergy members who brought patients to their hospitals. 
Some patients alleged that they were held in National Medical facilities 
against their will -- even strapped down by leather restraints in "seclusion 
rooms" -- or subjected to unneeded medical tests. 
</P>
<P>
 After a management shake-up in June that led to the ouster of company 
co-founders Richard K. Eamer and Leonard Cohen, new Chief Executive Jeffrey 
Barbakow moved quickly to resolve the legal problems. National Medical has 
already paid more than $230 million to settle all lawsuits brought by insurers 
and most of the patient cases. 
</P>
<P>
 To help meet legal expenses, the company has sold 85 of its 135 hospitals and 
clinics, including the recent sale of 47 psychiatric hospitals to Charter 
Medical Corp. for $200 million. National Medical's main focus now is operating 
35 general acute-care hospitals, which include Century City Hospital and USC 
University Hospital in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of the federal settlement -- which is still subject to final 
negotiations -- would surpass any health care or defense fraud settlement in 
history. The biggest settlement to date in a health care fraud case involved 
National Health Laboratories, a San Diego medical testing firm that agreed to a 
$111.4-million settlement in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Christi R. Sulzbach, National Medical's associate general counsel, said the 
company decided to disclose the tentative agreement Thursday as part of a 
required quarterly financial filing with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbakow conceded that the company does not yet have an agreement in writing 
with the federal agencies. "But we believe the negotiations have gotten to the 
point where we could estimate our liability." 
</P>
<P>
 The company estimated that it would cost $375 million to settle all pending 
state and federal litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbakow said he was "very happy" with the amount of the tentative settlement. 
Ten months ago, he noted, "This company was truly under a deathwatch. . . . 
After making all the payments for settling these past problems, we'll be left 
with a very strong business, an incredibly strong balance sheet and a great 
management team." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbakow said some former and current employees will remain "under a cloud" as 
long as state and federal investigations continue. Earlier this year, 
authorities in Topeka, Kan., indicted two former National Medical employees.

TAX DOCUMENTS RAISE NEW QUESTIONS ON WHITEWATER; INQUIRY: REAL ESTATE COMPANY'S 
RETURNS DO NOT REFLECT LOSSES CLAIMED BY PRESIDENT CLINTON AND HIS WIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Newly released tax returns for the Whitewater Development Corp. raise fresh 
questions about the assertion by President Clinton and his wife that they 
poured tens of thousands of dollars into the losing venture and received 
nothing in return. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons have consistently defended themselves against critics by arguing 
that they lost $46,636 on the land development project during the 1970s and 
1980s. Most of the money they spent, they have said, consisted of large 
interest payments made for Whitewater Development from their personal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the corporate tax returns of Whitewater Development, made public for the 
first time earlier this week, do not show evidence of payments anywhere near as 
large as the Clintons have said they made. Instead of documenting the $46,636 
that the Clintons say they lost on the Whitewater project, the tax records and 
supporting documents show only about $13,000 in such payments by the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
 Tax accountants said the corporation would have been obligated to reflect the 
full amount if it was adhering to standard accounting practices. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons' personal tax returns for the years in question show that they 
claimed $46,636 as tax deductions, though no canceled checks or bank statements 
have been released to substantiate the deductions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons have said the payments they claimed on their personal returns 
were made directly to banks holding Whitewater mortgages or to other 
corporations owned by James B. McDougal, the Clintons' partner in the 
Whitewater venture. In that case, the payments also should have shown up on 
Whitewater Development's corporate tax returns, according to independent tax 
accountants who reviewed the corporation's financial records. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a good job of bookkeeping was being done, you would find some record or 
some notation in the tax returns that the corporation was being relieved of its 
obligations," by the Clintons, said Mark Rogers, a Little Rock, Ark., 
accountant hired by The Times to review the Whitewater Development returns. 
</P>
<P>
 The apparent discrepancy between the personal and corporate tax returns raises 
more questions about central issues posed by the Clintons' chief GOP critics: 
Did the President and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton actually lose large 
sums of money on the Whitewater project, as they have said, and did they 
receive tax benefits to which they were not fully entitled? 
</P>
<P>
 The corporate tax records seem to support assertions made in recent months by 
McDougal. McDougal has claimed that the Clintons only invested about $13,000 in 
the Whitewater project, not the larger amounts cited by the President. (Clinton 
originally had said that he and his wife contributed $68,900 to the Whitewater 
endeavor, but he later revised the figure.)  
</P>
<P>
 So far, the White House has released no supporting materials, such as canceled 
checks or bank statements, to document the payments listed in the Clintons' 
personal tax returns. Tax experts said the corporate tax returns should have 
included entries corresponding with the payments listed in the personal 
returns, but they do not. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House declined to comment on the discrepancies. A source familiar 
with the Clintons' tax records said he could not explain why the full $46,636 
was not reflected in Whitewater Development's corporate returns. 
</P>
<P>
 There could be several possible explanations for the discrepancies between the 
personal and corporate tax returns. Whitewater Development bookkeepers could 
have failed to properly record all of the payments made by the Clintons or a 
tax preparer might have overlooked them. Similarly, the Clintons' records might 
have been faulty. Indeed, the Clintons and McDougal have characterized 
Whitewater Development's record-keeping practices as somewhat haphazard. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitewater Development's corporate returns show that in 1980, Hillary Rodham 
-- the name used by the First Lady at the time -- made $10,131 in interest 
payments on behalf of Whitewater Development. In 1979, the returns show, Bill 
Clinton made a loan to Whitewater Development of $2,900. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, however, Hillary Clinton received $15,185 back from Whitewater 
Development, according to the corporate tax records. The entry indicates that 
the payment was in the form of land owned by the corporation and not in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary Clinton took out a $30,000 loan from a McDougal-controlled bank to 
build a model home on one Whitewater lot, according to documents released by 
McDougal along with the corporate tax returns. But the corporate returns 
indicate that the property was not considered an asset of the corporation. 
Hillary Clinton later sold the property herself. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whitewater Development tax returns also call into question findings 
contained in a report issued by the Clinton presidential campaign in March, 
1992, in response to disclosures about the Whitewater controversy. The report, 
prepared by an accounting firm hired by James M. Lyons, a Denver attorney and 
old friend of Clinton, exonerated the Clintons of any misrepresentations.  
</P>
<P>
 Financial information in the corporate tax returns conflicts sharply with the 
figures in that report. For example, the report stated that the Whitewater 
venture suffered losses during years in which the corporation's tax returns 
show that it made money. And the corporate returns indicate that Whitewater 
Development was bringing in as much as $60,000 annually from land sales during 
years in which the Lyons report said that no land was sold. 
</P>
<P>
 The accounting firm that prepared the 1992 report clearly had access to the 
Whitewater Development tax returns. The campaign report said the analysis was 
based on the returns and many of the line entries in both the report and the 
Whitewater Development tax returns are identical.  
</P>
<P>
 The White House has distanced itself from the 1992 report in recent months but 
still uses many of its basic findings to defend the President and Hillary 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers said there is nothing in the Whitewater Development tax returns, the 
Clintons' personal tax returns as released by the White House or the campaign 
report that explains the discrepancies between the documents.

CIGARETTE CHIEFS STEADFASTLY DENY SMOKING KILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 In an often hostile exchange with congressional questioners Thursday, top 
tobacco company executives emphatically denied that they raise nicotine levels 
in cigarettes, insisted that nicotine is not addictive and said they remain 
unpersuaded that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer, emphysema, heart disease 
and other life-threatening ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have looked at the data . . . (and) it does not convince me that smoking 
causes death," said Andrew H. Tisch, chairman and chief executive officer of 
the Lorillard Tobacco Co. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the House Energy and 
Commerce subcommittee on health and the environment, berated the executives for 
their failure to acknowledge what medical experts have documented 
scientifically for many years: that cigarettes are addictive and that they kill 
more than 400,000 Americans annually. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is an astounding, almost incomprehensible statistic," Waxman said. 
"Imagine our nation's outrage if two fully loaded jumbo jets crashed each day 
killing all aboard. Yet, that's the same number of Americans that cigarettes 
kill every 24 hours." 
</P>
<P>
 The tobacco executives, appearing together before Congress for the first time, 
did so largely to respond to growing reports that the industry manipulates the 
level of nicotine in cigarettes to maintain smokers' addictions. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, momentum has been building on Capitol Hill and in other 
parts of the federal government to regulate cigarettes -- a product that has 
remained virtually unregulated, unlike foods, drugs and almost all other items 
in the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Food and Drug Administration officials recently announced that they believe 
the agency has the statutory authority to regulate cigarettes as drugs because 
of the addictive nature of nicotine, and the agency is actively exploring the 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "This hearing marks the beginning of a new relationship between Congress and 
the tobacco companies," Waxman said. "The old rules are out. The standards that 
apply to every other company are in." 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco companies have never acknowledged a link between cigarettes and health 
dangers and have maintained in lawsuits that smoking is not a matter of 
addiction but of freedom of choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Over and over again Thursday, industry officials denied that they manipulate 
nicotine levels to keep smokers addicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not do anything to hook smokers or keep them hooked," any more than 
coffee manufacturers manipulate caffeine, said James W. Johnston, chairman and 
chief executive officer of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. "This company is not 
engaged in some sinister plot to deceive the American smoker." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicotine, he added, only "enhances the overall smoking experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, all of the executives acknowledged that nicotine concentrations 
could be adjusted through blending different tobaccos -- a practice that they 
said their companies all engage in when manufacturing cigarettes to accommodate 
different tastes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, people will get different concentrations of nicotine in cigarettes 
depending on the blending process," said Alexander W. Spears, vice chairman of 
Lorillard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our smokers want a consistent product," Johnston said, insisting that the 
formulas are followed to maintain the individual qualities of each particular 
brand. "Our smokers want Winstons to taste like Winstons -- yesterday, today 
and tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 They also denied that nicotine is an addictive substance -- despite scientific 
evidence to the contrary -- maintaining that more than 40 million Americans 
have been able to quit the habit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Smokers are not drug users or addicts and we do not appreciate being 
characterized as such," said William Campbell, president of Philip Morris 
U.S.A. "I have a common-sense definition of addiction. I'm a smoker and I'm not 
a drug addict." 
</P>
<P>
 After being pressured by several subcommittee members, the tobacco officials, 
who have been accused of suppressing research showing the addictive qualities 
of nicotine, reluctantly agreed to turn over all of their animal research, 
notes, internal memoranda and other data to the subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 In a testy exchange, Johnston refused to provide materials deemed 
"proprietary," that is, containing trade secrets. He was met with the threat of 
a congressional subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
 "You will submit the data," Waxman demanded. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward J. Horrigan Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of Liggett Group 
Inc., said that he was "appalled by the conduct of the hearing," and Campbell 
called the session "theater bordering on circus." 
</P>
<P>
 The executives had at least one supporter on the subcommittee, Rep. Thomas J. 
Bliley Jr., the body's ranking Republican, who represents a district in the 
tobacco-growing state of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am proud to represent the thousands of honest, hard-working men and women 
who earn their livelihood producing this legal product," he said. "I am proud 
of all their positive contributions to my community. And I'll be damned if they 
are sacrificed on the altar of political correctness."

BROWN HARRIED BY CONTROVERSY OVER TEACHER FORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>

<P>
 The California Labor Federation, AFL-CIO, announced its endorsement of state 
Treasurer Kathleen Brown's gubernatorial bid Thursday amid continuing 
allegations -- vigorously denied by Brown campaign staffers -- that the 
candidate cheated in her effort to win another key endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 At a morning news conference, John Henning, the labor federation's executive 
secretary, said Brown won the group's support by an overwhelming margin because 
of her management skills, her social conscience and her "impeccable integrity." 
But moments later, Brown found herself defending that reputation as reporters 
asked her to respond to a letter from her chief Democratic rival, Insurance 
Commissioner John Garamendi. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi's letter, addressed to Brown but distributed widely to reporters, 
alleges that before a California Teachers Assn. forum in January, Brown tried 
to gain unfair advantage over Garamendi and Gov. Pete Wilson by arranging to 
receive in advance the questions that would be asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if true, the allegations do not rank on an all-time list of political 
dirty tricks. But Garamendi partisans contend that Brown's need to obtain the 
questions in advance underscores her lack of confidence and inability to think 
on her feet. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, CTA political director Alice Huffman confirmed that she worked 
with Brown "more than anyone else because she needed it more than anyone else" 
because Brown seemed less familiar with the CTA's views on key issues. But 
Huffman, who has been criticized because an independent political action 
committee she controls received $175,000 from the Brown campaign earlier this 
year, said there was nothing improper about the briefings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted her to have a fair shot. Our position is, 'We want you to know what 
we believe is the right answer.' I felt like Kathleen needed extra help and I 
gave it to her," said Huffman, who said the final questions were not written 
until about 20 minutes before the forum "so there was nothing to give anyone, 
no sheet of paper." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's vague responses to Garamendi's repeated charges have allowed the CTA 
forum three months ago to become a continuing irritant for her campaign. Even 
on Thursday, when Brown presumably expected to be asked about Garamendi's 
letter, she offered a confusing account. "In every interview with every 
organization that I seek support from, I have been fully briefed, have received 
questions and have always sought to find out what the issues of importance are. 
. . ," said Brown, who called the flap over the CTA forum an attention-grabbing 
tactic of her "desperate" opponent. "I never received a list." 
</P>
<P>
 But a few minutes later, Brown said, "I was given, as with every single group 
that I meet with, an itemization of what their top questions and concerns were. 
. . . I did my homework." When a reporter asked whether she thought it was fair 
that she had received such an "itemization" when other candidates had not, 
Brown balked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't given it," she said, adding later: "I did not receive anything 
inappropriate to my knowledge whatsoever. . . . I am not aware of any special 
treatment that I've received." 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, Michael Reese, Brown's spokesman, hastened to clarify, telling 
reporters: "What she was referring to were lists that were compiled prior to 
the forum by members of the (CTA) organization of possible questions and issues 
of concern." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's opponents quickly pounced on her response. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she didn't get the questions, wouldn't the answer just have been, 'No'?" 
asked Dan Schnur, spokesman for Wilson's reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Darry Sragow, Garamendi's campaign manager, agreed. "The question is very 
simple: Did she cheat on the exam?" he asked. "Either she cheated on the exam 
or she didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown's allies at the CTA said Brown did nothing wrong. When asked to 
explain what Brown referred to as an "itemization," Huffman said Brown "is not 
able to distinguish between all the prepping we gave her and the (final) 
questions. . . put together 20 minutes before the forum." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman said that while she worked with Brown, she assigned a staff member to 
work with Garamendi. "I don't believe (Brown) had any unfair advantage unless 
people think having me was an advantage," Huffman said. (Wilson was offered a 
briefing, but declined). 
</P>
<P>
 According to Sragow, the only CTA official that Garamendi had access to was 
Frank Graham-Caso, a member of the executive board who on a single occasion 
discussed education with Garamendi over a cup of coffee. Sragow said that at 
the time, Huffman refused to return his telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, after Garamendi first made public his concerns about Huffman's 
role in the CTA endorsement process, the CTA announced that it would not 
endorse a candidate in the June 7 primary because no candidate had won 60% of 
delegates' support. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to Garamendi's charges, the CTA last month reviewed the $175,000 
contribution that Brown made earlier this year to the political action 
committee headed by Huffman. Garamendi's campaign alleged that the contribution 
was made to unfairly sway the union to endorse Brown. But the CTA review found 
"nothing to support a charge that Alice Huffman or any (other) CTA staff person 
acted inappropriately."

OFFICIALS SAY FUMES PROBABLY DID NOT CAUSE WOMAN'S DEATH; MYSTERY: BODY OF 
GLORIA RAMIREZ IS RELEASED FOR BURIAL BY RIVERSIDE COUNTY OFFICIALS, WHO SAY 
HER REMAINS PRESENT NO HEALTH HAZARD. THEY SAY HOSPITAL IS NOT BELIEVED TO BE 
THE SOURCE OF WHATEVER KILLED HER. 
</P>

<P>
 County officials released the body of Gloria Ramirez to her family Thursday, 
saying they are "90% sure" they know the cause of her Feb. 19 death -- and that 
it probably was not linked to the mystery fumes that forced the evacuation of 
the Riverside General Hospital emergency room where she died.  
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Bradley Gilbert, the Riverside County public health officer, wrote the 
family, saying that scientific and medical experts have concluded that the body 
does "not currently present a public health hazard" and can now -- eight weeks 
after her death -- be handled by a mortuary in preparation for burial. 
</P>
<P>
 But finding a mortuary willing to accept the body proved more difficult than 
the family expected. Ronald Schwartz, the family's attorney, said a local 
funeral director declined Thursday afternoon to immediately accept the body. 
The funeral home became anxious, Schwartz said, because it received a call from 
Cal/OSHA offering advice on what precautions to take in dealing with the 
corpse. 
</P>
<P>
 The mortician at the funeral home, Acheson and Graham, "is a little concerned 
now, and he wants a little time to see what this involves," Schwartz said. No 
one in a position to speak on behalf of the funeral home could be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney representing the county said Thursday it was unlikely that the 
source of the mystery fumes will ever be known. But he hinted broadly that 
experts are focusing their attention on Ramirez as the source, rather than a 
toxic source at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the Ramirez family said a private autopsy would be conducted 
today in their own effort to learn the cause of death of the 31-year-old mother 
of two. But Schwartz conceded that the autopsy may be of little value because 
the unembalmed body has decomposed. 
</P>
<P>
 The family's attorneys had hoped to win a court order Thursday forcing the 
Riverside County coroner's office to turn over its investigative file on the 
death of Ramirez and the findings of its probe into the source of fumes that 
sickened six emergency room attendants, two of them seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Julie Gorchynski had to be hospitalized for 13 days for breathing lapses 
and muscle spasms after treating Ramirez, and she returned to a hospital this 
week for surgery to restore blood circulation to her knees. Gorchynski said the 
condition was brought on by exposure to the fumes. Nurse Sally Balderas was 
hospitalized for 10 days and continues to complain of nausea, headaches, 
breathing lapses and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside Superior Court Judge Victor Miceli rejected the request that the 
coroner's files be turned over. He scheduled an April 26 hearing on whether to 
order members of the coroner's staff to be available for depositions by the 
family attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, however, much of what the family hopes to learn may already have been 
released. Bill Ritner, an attorney representing the county, said the coroner's 
office is within two weeks of issuing a death certificate and that officials 
are now 90% sure they know the cause of her death, but he would not elaborate.  
</P>
<P>
 But Ritner said the experts are virtually certain that the woman's death was 
not attributable to the fumes that sickened the emergency room staff. "The 
fumes did not cause her death," he said. "She would have died anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Ritner said it was likely that investigators may never find the source of the 
fumes, partly because "we're probably dealing with a substance that 
evaporated." But he said he believed that the hospital itself was not the 
source of the unknown poison because nobody working there fell ill until 
Ramirez -- complaining of nausea and breathing difficulty -- was brought in. 
</P>
<P>
 Ritner said it was the consensus of the county's medical and scientific 
experts that the drawing of Ramirez's blood into the pre-sterilized syringe 
triggered the bizarre episode. 
</P>
<P>
 Ritner said the most credible witness to the event was Gorchynski, whom he 
characterized as an alert and healthy emergency room physician. After a nurse 
smelled the blood-filled syringe and complained of an ammonia-like odor before 
she fainted, Gorchynski put the syringe to her own nose and took a deep whiff. 
</P>
<P>
 "She went down virtually immediately," Ritner said of Gorchynski's response to 
smelling the blood. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked whether that meant that Ramirez was therefore considered to be the 
source of the mystery fumes, Ritner said it did not. But she has not been ruled 
out as the source either, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Ritner said that in its unprecedented effort to get to the bottom of the 
mystery, the county had sent evidence to a federal government laboratory that 
has the capability of analyzing minuscule levels of chemicals.  
</P>
<P>
 Only a few tests remain to be completed before the county will conclude its 
investigation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz said the family's own autopsy would be conducted today by Dr. Richard 
Fukumoto, a forensic pathologist for Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the autopsy proves fruitless, Schwartz said, the release of the body 
to the family and allowing the casket to be opened "means we can see if she's 
really in the container" -- an issue that, he said, had troubled the family 
until now.

1998 ELECTRIC CAR DEADLINE BACKED; POLLUTION: STATE AIR BOARD'S STAFF REBUTS 
CONTENTION BY THE AUTO INDUSTRY THAT TECHNOLOGY IS NOT FAR ENOUGH ALONG. THE 
BOARD WILL TAKE UP THE MATTER NEXT MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Laying the groundwork for a contentious vote next month, the staff of the 
California Air Resources Board recommended Thursday that the state go forward 
with its mandate for mass-produced electric cars beginning in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Resources Board meets May 12 and 13 in Los Angeles to decide whether 
automotive technology has advanced enough to uphold a standard that requires 
major car companies to begin selling thousands of electric vehicles in 
California every year. 
</P>
<P>
 While the U.S. auto industry contends that batteries will remain too unrefined 
and costly to meet the deadline, the ARB staff insists that several advanced 
technologies can be ready for commercial production by then. Thursday's 
recommendation to the board echoes technical findings that the ARB issued in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the state's standard, 2% of vehicles sold by each major manufacturer in 
California each year must be emission-free beginning in 1998. That amounts to 
20,000 to 25,000 cars. The volume increases to 5% in 2001 and 10% in 2003. 
Companies violating the standard could lose their certification to sell cars in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 As the deadline approaches, auto makers -- particularly Detroit's Big Three -- 
have been putting increasing pressure on California to grant delays. At a 
five-hour workshop in March, U.S. car makers said they could not be ready until 
at least mid-2001. 
</P>
<P>
 ARB officials said Thursday, however, that the timetable can be met. 
</P>
<P>
 Electric vehicles "are more possible than ever before," James Boyd, the ARB's 
executive officer, said Thursday. If the mandate is weakened, auto makers will 
not be aggressive in bringing cleaner-burning cars to California, the staff 
said in its report.

<P>
 "Tremendous technological progress has been made over the last few years," the 
ARB report says, "and . . . the mandate is the reason that much of this 
development has taken place." 
</P>
<P>
 The ARB must review its zero-emission mandates every two years. Next month's 
decision is pivotal, because it is the last realistic chance the auto companies 
will have to delay the standards before they must make major investments in 
manufacturing plants. If they fail, the industry's only other option is to 
persuade Congress to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 ARB members, led by Gov. Pete Wilson's newly appointed chairwoman, Jacqueline 
Schafer, so far have showed strong support for the mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 ARB staff members say it is not technology that is impeding electric cars but 
the reluctance of U.S. car makers to invest adequately. The car companies, 
however, say they are worried they will have to rush to market with a product 
that is not viable for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 A reasonably priced, high-energy battery is considered crucial to the success 
of electric vehicles. Without it, cars must be frequently recharged. Today's 
lead-acid battery packs can power a car for about 100 miles, while more 
advanced prototypes have a range of more than 200 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 "EVs (electric vehicles) have three problems: cost, range and infrastructure," 
John Williams, a General Motors engineer who represents a consortium of the Big 
Three auto makers and battery producers, told the ARB last month.  
</P>
<P>
 The companies need more time, Williams said, mainly because high-energy 
batteries are available only as expensive, hand-crafted prototypes. Getting 
them ready for affordable, high-volume manufacture will take about seven years, 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The low-cost batteries have low energy and the high-energy ones have high 
costs," he said. "What we're trying to do is get today's $40,000 battery down 
to $6,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said the companies expect to have an advanced, well tested battery 
pack prototype in 1996, a production plant starting up in 1998 and enough 
batteries to meet the mandate in mid-2001. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, Williams warned, "it is a high-risk" venture, since the rest of the 
car still must be attractive to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Battery manufacturers, however, are more optimistic than the U.S. car makers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're completely confident that we can meet all the goals by 1998, including 
the cost. . . . We have no intention of waiting until 1998 to produce these 
batteries," Michael Fetcenko, vice president of technology for Michigan-based 
Ovonic Battery Co., recently told the staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Ovonic's advanced nickel-metal-hydride batteries, he said, are "already in 
high-volume production" for laptop computers, and in a road test in GM's Impact 
electric car, one ran 250 miles without a recharge. 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing the cost down for cars, he said, "is achievable within three to four 
years" -- several years sooner than GM's Williams predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Little is publicly known about how far Japanese auto makers have progressed, 
because they have been much quieter than their American counterparts. The ARB 
staff, however, says it considered confidential information from Japanese 
companies in its recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 The ARB concedes that cost will be a problem, but only initially. In the first 
few years, electric cars will cost $5,000 to $10,000 more than a 
gasoline-fueled car, but the ARB maintains that as more vehicles are produced, 
prices will become comparable. 
</P>
<P>
 The operating costs will be virtually the same -- 6.3 to 9 cents per mile for 
an electric car compared with 7.7 cents per mile for a conventional Ford 
Escort, according to the ARB report. 
</P>
<P>
 The oil industry has argued that using cleaner-burning gasoline and 
alternative fuels such as methanol and natural gas is a more practical and 
economical way to clean California's air. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ARB staff maintains that zero-emission cars are perhaps the only way 
to eliminate enough exhaust to achieve health standards.

EX-SEN. CARPENTER SEIZED IN COSTA RICA; FUGITIVE: THE FORMER LEGISLATOR FLED 
EARLIER THIS YEAR AFTER BEING CONVICTED OF POLITICAL CORRUPTION. PROSECUTOR IS 
CONFIDENT HE WILL BE EXTRADITED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former state Sen. Paul B. Carpenter, who fled the country earlier this year 
after his conviction on political corruption charges, was arrested Thursday in 
Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Atty. Charles J. Stevens said that Costa Rican authorities found 
Carpenter living in a condominium in a suburb of that nation's capital city, 
San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter's attorney, Charles F. Bloodgood, said the 66-year-old former 
Democratic lawmaker from Downey apparently expected to be caught, but perhaps 
not quite so soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloodgood said he received a vague note some weeks ago in which Carpenter 
apologized for his flight. Carpenter wrote that his attorney from an 
unidentified country would contact the Sacramento lawyer "when the FBI catches 
up with me." 
</P>
<P>
 "I hadn't expected they would find him so soon," Bloodgood said. "Paul 
Carpenter is a very intelligent, resourceful individual. The FBI got him 
comparatively quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Bloodgood said he believes that Carpenter left the country with no more than 
$8,000 in savings and without prospects for additional income. Federal 
prosecutors last month obtained a court order that in effect cuts off 
Carpenter's state pension. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't in very great financial shape," said Bloodgood, who noted that 
legal expenses had depleted Carpenter's savings. "It was a very, very 
low-budget flight." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Stevens said his office, working with the U.S. State Department, 
has asked that Carpenter be held without bail while awaiting extradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens was confident that Carpenter would be returned to the United States, 
where he faces sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a straightforward, slam-dunk extradition request," Stevens said, 
pointing out that the United States has an extradition treaty that has 
generally been honored by the Costa Rican government.  
</P>
<P>
 In February, Carpenter failed to show up at a sentencing hearing after his 
conviction on 11 counts of extortion, racketeering and conspiracy. He faced a 
maximum sentence of seven years and three months in prison on those charges, 
and he was awaiting a retrial in a separate corruption case as well. He is also 
facing possible charges relating to his flight that could add up to 10 years to 
his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 After Carpenter fled, he sent a note to federal District Judge Edward J. 
Garcia saying that he was leaving the country for alternative treatment for 
terminal prostate cancer. In the handwritten note, Carpenter wrote: "I find my 
drive for survival stronger than my sense of obligation to your legal system." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Bloodgood said he always expected that Carpenter would one day 
voluntarily return for treatment of his disease in California, where he was 
covered by medical insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 After Carpenter's flight, the FBI issued a postcard-size wanted notice, which 
it distributed around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens said Carpenter was first spotted in late February, living in a hotel 
in San Jose under a false name. Earlier this week, when all the necessary 
papers were filed and Costa Rican authorities moved in for the arrest, 
Carpenter had checked out of his hotel without leaving a forwarding address. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were concerned that he had gotten wind of the extradition request and fled 
Costa Rica," Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Costa Rican authorities soon found him again, living in a condominium in a 
suburb of San Jose, and arrested him. 
</P>
<P>
 A source close to Carpenter indicated that he may have felt safe from 
extradition in the Central American country. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stevens said that extradition difficulties are more likely to occur in 
cases where a fugitive has been accused of a crime but not convicted. 
"Typically, if the request is based on a conviction, (extradition) should be 
more streamlined." 
</P>
<P>
 Bloodgood predicted that Carpenter will fight extradition. "He's looking at a 
lot of trouble," he said.

LATIN AMERICA; U.S. MILITARY IN EL SALVADOR AT CENTER OF ANOTHER SCANDAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The civil war is over, and the presence of U.S. Army advisers is being 
substantially reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet suddenly, for the second time in three months, the U.S. military here 
finds itself at the center of scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 First, an American defense attache leaving a party shot and killed his 
Salvadoran bodyguard; the army major was whisked out of the country but may be 
court-martialed. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, an American lieutenant colonel tried to prove to Salvadoran police that 
a grenade he was holding was a dud. He pulled the pin, and the explosion killed 
him and wounded four Salvadoran policemen and bodyguards. 
</P>
<P>
 During the long war that the U.S. government helped fight against El 
Salvador's Marxist guerrillas, such incidents probably would have been kept 
quiet. But now, in a sign of how times change, the cases are being widely 
publicized and criticized -- by the left, to be sure, but even more 
vociferously by the right and the institutions of a government long bolstered 
by the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggesting that alcohol or drugs were involved in the cases, the head of the 
Salvadoran police -- a force built largely with U.S. money -- went so far as to 
demand that all U.S. Embassy personnel submit to drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of these people were once in Vietnam," said Jose Maria Monterrey, chief 
of the National Civilian Police, "so I think it would be appropriate for them 
to take dope-detection tests." 
</P>
<P>
 Monterrey based his comments on a report from chief coroner Juan Mateu Llort, 
who claimed that U.S. Army Lt. Col. Julio Rivera was under the influence of 
three drugs when he detonated the grenade. This week, however, the U.S. Embassy 
said drug tests were negative. When questioned, an agitated Monterrey 
responded, "The courts, not the embassy, are the authority here." 
</P>
<P>
 Since El Salvador's civil war formally ended in 1992, members of El Salvador's 
right-wing government have become increasingly angry at the Clinton 
Administration, which has released incriminating documents about the right's 
war-time involvement in death squads.  
</P>
<P>
 Police say Maj. Ismael Lopez, an assistant army attache assigned to the U.S. 
Embassy, killed his bodyguard, Jose Crescencio Diaz, on Jan. 21 after becoming 
drunk at a party. Diaz had taken away Lopez's gun, but then returned it and was 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 What most rankled Salvadorans was that Lopez, who enjoyed diplomatic immunity, 
was immediately put under the protection of the U.S. Embassy and sent out of 
the country in a U.S. military aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Monterrey accused embassy personnel of interfering with the 
investigation. Supreme Court President Mauricio Gutierrez Castro, who himself 
has been accused of botching cases in the past and is under international 
pressure to resign, suggested that laws were broken in spiriting Lopez away. 
The Salvadoran Foreign Ministry demanded an explanation of the procedure used 
in arranging his departure. 
</P>
<P>
 Embassy officials deny tampering with the investigation but have agreed to 
more formal clearance of military air traffic in the future, according to 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 They also sought to assure the Salvadorans that Lopez would be submitted to 
U.S. military justice. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing is scheduled next Wednesday to decide whether Lopez will be 
court-martialed on a charge of unpremeditated murder, according to a spokesman 
at U.S. Southern Command headquarters in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as the Lopez case was fading from public awareness, Rivera was killed 
April 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Salvadoran guards were stopped by police for speeding and jailed when 
police found a hand grenade and other weapons on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivera was summoned to the police station to take them into custody, but he 
first tried to prove that the grenade was a dud. When it exploded, it killed 
him and wounded two policemen and two of the Salvadoran guards. 
</P>
<P>
 The embassy, expressing "dismay" over the accident, flew the two police 
officers who were most seriously wounded to Texas for treatment.

ASIA; KHMER ROUGE STILL A THREAT IN CAMBODIA; GUERRILLAS LOST THEIR 
HEADQUARTERS TO GOVERNMENT TROOPS. BUT THEY COULD MAKE A COMEBACK WITH 
MONSOONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Despite the loss last month of their headquarters in the gem-mining town of 
Pailin, the Maoist guerrillas known as the Khmer Rouge still pose a formidable 
threat to the government in Phnom Penh, according to diplomats here. 
</P>
<P>
 Government troops marched into the town, which lies on the border with 
Thailand, on March 19. It was the first time since 1989 that the town has been 
back in government hands. 
</P>
<P>
 To get there, the Cambodian army had to detour around nearly 20 miles of road 
-- land that has been described as the most heavily mined in the world. The 
Khmer Rouge has clung tenaciously to their unofficial capital for good reason: 
The rubies and timber produced in the region put millions of dollars into the 
movement's coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 The government is now rushing reinforcements into Pailin because the arrival 
of the annual monsoon rains in a month or two will make the rough-hewn track 
that now links Pailin with the outside world virtually impassable. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the rains come, diplomats say, the government's advantage in tanks and 
armored cars will disappear, and the battle will be fought on conventional 
guerrilla terms, which could tip the advantage to the field-hardened Khmer 
Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has staked its prestige on holding the town, and its loss could 
represent "another Dienbienphu," in the words of King Norodom Sihanouk, 
referring to France's catastrophic defeat to Vietnamese insurgents in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the battle at Pailin had begun, the government seized the Khmer 
Rouge border camp called Anlong Veng in northwestern Cambodia, only to lose it 
again a week later. That battle showed that the Khmer Rouge has plenty of fight 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 One Western analyst compared fighting the Khmer Rouge to punching a pillow -- 
you create an indentation in one place but the pillow expands into another. 
After Pailin, the rebels did not surrender but merely dissipated to the north 
and west. Perhaps this lingering threat helps explain why Hun Sen, one of the 
government's two prime ministers, called for a cease-fire to mark this week's 
Cambodian New Year celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a million Cambodians died from starvation, disease and mistreatment 
under the Khmer Rouge, which ruled Cambodia from 1975 until 1979. As a result, 
the group is widely despised but also feared. 
</P>
<P>
 The Khmer Rouge refused to cooperate with the U.N. peace effort in Cambodia 
and boycotted the May, 1993, elections, which resulted in a coalition 
government in Phnom Penh. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition has produced a new army, said to number about 120,000 men, made 
up of soldiers from the old Phnom Penh regime and two non-Communist guerrilla 
groups. The army chief of staff, Gen. Ke Kim Yan, is widely regarded as one of 
the most able men in the country, and he had the independence to choose an 
officer of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front, his former adversary, 
as his ground commander for the Pailin campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 But the government is close to running out of ammunition and has been cut off 
from virtually all the military aid it received in the past from Russia and 
Vietnam. Paradoxically, the Khmer Rouge, which tried to implement Maoist 
economic reforms when it governed Cambodia, has raised considerable cash and 
has been able to buy plenty of military hardware, spare parts and ammunition on 
the open market. A Rebel Escape Hatch 
</P>
<P>
 Cambodia's Khmer Rouge guerrillas have survived in part, officials say, 
because Thailand has allowed them to slip across the border to safety. 
</P>
<P>
 1. The Khmer Rouge have been flushed from their headquarters in Pailin. 
</P>
<P>
 2. The Thais have opened their borders to the Khmer Rouge rebels and do 
business with them, allowing the group to survive, diplomats said.

HOLIDAY CELEBRATIONS TEMPERED IN ISRAEL; MIDEAST: MILLIONS OBSERVE INDEPENDENCE 
DAY DESPITE ISLAMIC EXTREMIST THREATS. FUNERALS HELD AFTER SUICIDE BOMBING OF 
BUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With daylong displays of air force acrobatics and thousands of barbecues 
nationwide, millions of Israelis on Thursday defiantly answered Islamic 
extremist threats to attack Israeli targets on Independence Day with picnics, 
parties and pronouncements of national pride. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the celebrations, which filled the nation's parks, beaches and back 
yards, were more subdued than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day Israel commemorates its creation in 1948 -- traditionally the 
biggest party of the year, but a day that Palestinian fundamentalists had vowed 
last week to "turn into hell" -- there also were funerals and condemnations 
after the second of two suicide bombings in a week on a passenger bus deep 
inside northern Israel left six dead in Hadera on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police investigators reconstructing the attack on the packed commuter bus 
concluded Thursday that it was the work of a Palestinian fundamentalist 
suicide-bomber. He was from a village near the Green Line separating Israel 
from the occupied West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The attacker was waiting for the bus in Hadera, investigators said. He boarded 
it carrying one bomb after planting another explosive device on a nearby bench. 
The second bomb was timed to detonate about 11 a.m. Wednesday, when sirens 
sounded throughout Israel to mark its Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian sources and a leaflet from the fundamentalist Palestinian group 
Hamas identified the suicide bomber Thursday as Ammar Amarneh, 22. Reports from 
his village -- Yabad, in the occupied West Bank near the border with northern 
Israel -- said he left a note in a local mosque appealing to his family not to 
mourn his death. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hamas leaflet claimed the young farmer as a member of the group's armed 
wing, Izzadine Qassim; it proclaimed him "our heroic martyr." Black flags of 
mourning flew throughout the village, and most of its 10,000 residents paid 
condolence calls on Amarneh's family. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the Israeli dead, police said Thursday, was an Arab woman from Hadera: 
Bilha Boutin, 49. She apparently was standing beside the suicide bomber when he 
detonated the powerful charge. Boutin absorbed most of the blast, which 
forensic experts said prevented even higher casualties on the bus, packed with 
almost 70 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the five Israeli dead, only one was identified as a soldier. He was Sgt. 
Ari Perlmutter, who was buried in Rehovot on Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 But even in Hadera on Thursday, there were many more picnics than funerals. 
The mayor there decided the Independence Day celebrations should go on, despite 
the grief, anger and fear in the working-class town of 50,000. Top Israeli 
officials also urged the nation to go forward in Independence Day interviews 
and speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 President Ezer Weizman called on the nation not to dwell on the recent terror 
and death, but to focus on Israel's economic and diplomatic growth since the 
international community carved it out of British-ruled Palestine after the Nazi 
genocide of Jews in the 1930s and 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite the terror, despite the uneasiness, despite the situation now . . . 
we have a great country," he said on Israel Radio, as Israeli pilots in F-16 
jet fighters conducted dizzying acrobatic displays in the skies. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite the recent wave of terrorism that Hamas has said is meant to 
retaliate for a Jewish settler's massacre of about 30 Palestinians at prayer in 
a Hebron mosque on Feb. 25, Weizman insisted that security in Israel is better 
than it has ever been. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin echoed Weizman's expressions of pride but 
also reaffirmed his vow to continue the peace process with the Palestine 
Liberation Organization, despite opposition in the aftermath of the suicide 
attacks. Hamas opposes the process, and Rabin said the bombings are politically 
motivated "to murder peace." 
</P>
<P>
 In a series of interviews and talk-show appearances, Rabin asserted that an 
even higher level of violence and terrorism is the only alternative if the two 
sides do not reach their long-delayed accord, which promises an Israeli 
withdrawal and Palestinian autonomy beginning in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 As he spoke, Israel's security forces remained on heightened alert, 
aggressively enforcing the government's strict closure of the occupied 
territories. A large-scale redeployment of Israeli troops also began in the 
West Bank on Thursday, as officials heeded Rabin's decision -- made after the 
Hadera bombing -- to move soldiers protecting Jewish settlements in the 
territories back across the Green Line to reinforce security in sovereign 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin said Thursday that security forces are still responsible for the safety 
of the more than 120,000 Jewish settlers who moved into government-financed 
settlements in the occupied territories after Israel conquered the lands in the 
1967 Arab-Israeli War. But he added that residents of sovereign Israel took 
precedence over the settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 To protest that decision and the "Gaza-Jericho first" accord, several thousand 
Jewish settlers marched in Gaza on Thursday. Police said the demonstration was 
peaceful.

NEWS ANALYSIS; COPTER TRAGEDY TARNISHES LUSTER OF GULF WAR SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By HUGH POPE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 The American "friendly fire" that shot down two U.S. helicopters over the 
mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan on Thursday also blew a gaping hole in a fragile 
success story that has grown out of the 1991 Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 As the hours of silence lengthened after the midmorning tragedy, reports here 
strengthened that U.S. pilots had probably killed all four allied colonels -- 
American, British, French and Turkish -- who had spearheaded Western efforts to 
protect the 3.5 million ethnic Kurds of northern Iraq from the armies of the 
vengeful Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
 The helicopters carrying the colonels and the other victims crashed north of 
Salahuddin, an old summer mountain resort. The passengers on the doomed 
helicopters apparently were due to land in the town for a lavish feast and 
talks with leaders of the two main Iraqi Kurdish guerrilla groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Such meetings are usually a pleasant, monthly routine for the high-powered 
military mission, which is based in a small house behind a sandbagged perimeter 
in Zakhu, near the Turkish border in northwestern Iraq. These are the forward 
elements of Operation Provide Comfort, the successor to allied operations in 
northern Iraq after the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 The operation's mission is to ensure that Hussein's army does not advance over 
front lines with Iraqi Kurdistan and repeat the attacks that drove 1.5 million 
Iraqi Kurdish refugees into the wintry mountains of Turkey and Iran after the 
collapse of their post-Gulf War revolt. 
</P>
<P>
 To accomplish these goals, the allies' chief step has been to declare a "no 
fly" zone north of the 36th Parallel, incorporating most of Iraqi Kurdistan. 
(Allied planes have been enforcing a similar air umbrella over southern Iraq, 
south of the 32nd Parallel, to protect Shiite Muslims since August, 1992.) 
</P>
<P>
 The allies have been enforcing the "no fly" edict with a force of American, 
French and British warplanes based in Incirlik, near Adana in Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 An American spokesman at Incirlik declined to say how many U.S. warplanes fly 
into Iraq, though the number is believed to be between 20 and 30. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. helicopters are based at another Turkish air base in Diyarbakir. Ground 
support crews make up the bulk of about 1,700 service personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Under this allied protection, the Kurds have made amazing progress, 
considering the circumstances of the international embargo against Iraq, 
regional hostility and a harsh blockade from the Baghdad-controlled south. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of the thousands of Kurdish villages dynamited by Hussein's engineers 
have been rebuilt. Reasonably democratic elections have been held. An 
autonomous administration is gradually establishing itself -- to the extent 
that it stamps passports and has posted some representatives abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 But entry signs saying "Welcome to Kurdistan" also send shivers in neighboring 
Middle Eastern states such as Turkey, Syria and Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 All these countries have restive Kurdish minorities, totaling more than 20 
million people; the Kurds commonly are called the world's largest nation 
without a state. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, Iraq has not given up on its Kurdish mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The two main Kurdish groups said in a joint April 12 statement that they had 
arrested two Iraqi agents with orders to attack the few foreigners still 
helping or monitoring developments in Iraqi Kurdistan -- U.N. guards, workers 
for aid agencies and foreign journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Under interrogation, the two men were said to have confessed to playing a part 
in an upsurge in attacks on foreigners in the last month, specifically the 
murder of German reporter Lissy Schmidt on April 3 and the shooting and 
injuring of two Austrian U.N. guards on March 27. In a separate incident, a 
bomb exploded in the car of a Swedish reporter, who was slightly hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Kurdish officials initially expressed their belief that the 
Iraqis had shot down the U.S. helicopters as part of this campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the smaller-scale efforts that the Kurds say they have detected, other 
analysts in the region also see signs of increased threatening moves by the 
Iraqi dictator, who has made clear his unhappiness with the U.N. Security 
Council's extension last month of the 3 1/2-year-old trade sanctions that are 
strangling Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, analysts say Hussein has strengthened his northern army, 
which rings the western and southern boundaries of the 19,300-square-mile, 
allied-protected enclave. 
</P>
<P>
 After moving up as many as two divisions of his elite Republican Guard -- 
equipped with battle tanks and helicopter gunships, backed by other armored and 
mechanized infantry units -- Hussein has between 150,000 and 280,000 troops in 
the north, the Associated Press has said. 
</P>
<P>
 These troops are facing 30,000 or so lightly armed Kurdish guerrillas who call 
themselves peshmerga, or "those who face death." 
</P>
<P>
 Kurdish officials, the AP said, have reported that in recent weeks many of the 
estimated 3 million people living in the enclave are packing their bags and 
preparing to flee because they fear that the unpredictable Hussein will move 
against them once again. 
</P>
<P>
 Hussein's brutal repression against the Kurds has sparked a global outcry. 
Thousands of Kurds died of starvation and exposure in the northern mountains 
after Hussein's forces crushed their rebellion in April, 1991.

GERMAN TYCOON DISAPPEARS, TRIGGERING PROBE; EUROPE: 40 CREDITOR BANKS AGREE TO 
KEEP MAJOR REAL ESTATE FIRM AFLOAT DESPITE HIS LEAVING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF 
DEBT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARJORIE MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 German authorities launched an investigation Thursday into the finances of one 
of the country's biggest real estate moguls and his wife, who disappeared over 
the weekend, leaving behind billions of dollars of debt and an empire in 
disarray. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives of the abandoned Dr. Juergen Schneider holding company met in 
Frankfurt with representatives of more than 40 creditor banks seeking ways to 
avoid bankruptcy and to complete unfinished construction projects. They agreed 
to keep the company afloat, at least for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
 The Schneider group owns some of the most prominent commercial properties in 
Frankfurt, Leipzig, Wiesbaden and other German cities. Its collapse could put 
thousands of workers out of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Chancellor Helmut Kohl warned the banks against rushing the 
company into bankruptcy. If bankruptcy is declared, the group's estimated 
$5-billion debt would reportedly make it one of the biggest in Germany since 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 German newspapers, which once called owner Schneider the "Construction King" 
for his 80 or so projects nationwide, now have dubbed the 59-year-old tycoon a 
"Gentleman Bandit" and a "Fine Cad." 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider and his wife, Claudia, had sole control over their companies' 
accounts. He left his holding company a letter last Friday saying he had fallen 
ill over Easter and was told by his family doctor to retire from business 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the couple disappeared, owing an estimated $3 billion to banks and about 
$150 million to contractors and suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody said he's in Paraguay and someone else saw him in Dresden," said 
Hildegard Becker-Toussaint, spokeswoman for the Frankfurt public prosecutor's 
office, which launched the fraud investigation. "He's also in the Bavarian 
woods. He's seen everywhere at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider is also said to own properties in Switzerland, Brazil and the Canary 
Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankfurt prosecutors began their probe after receiving a complaint from 
Deutsche Bank that Schneider had secured a credit for a Frankfurt shopping 
center based on false documentation. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank, which was not publicly commenting on the case Thursday, said 
Schneider had obtained a loan claiming that the fancy Zeil-Galerie center had 
more than twice the space and seven times the rent-earning potential than it 
actually had. Deutsche Bank was the Schneider group's largest creditor, with 
loans estimated at about $757 million. The bank lent the company $241 million 
for the Zeil-Galerie. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just one little bit (of the fraud), and Deutsche Bank started with 
this. It's only one bit. It will come piece by piece," Becker-Toussaint said. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the meeting between bankers and Schneider managers, Michael Kramer, 
a director of Deutsche Bank, said a coordinating committee had been established 
to keep company projects going. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coordinating group is ready to supply the necessary personnel and 
administrative costs within limits," Kramer said. "Based on the given 
information, we have to assume that the companies won't be able to run in the 
long term." 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider was known as a vain man and dapper dresser, with gray temples under 
a black toupee and rectangular reading glasses. He lived in a fairy tale villa 
called Andreae in posh Koenigstein, outside of Frankfurt. He traveled the 
country by private Lear jet. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a construction firm owner, Schneider was an engineer who worked for 
several years at the Frankfurt-based Philipp Holzmann building group before 
founding his own company in 1981. He was known for paying his bills late, but 
bankers considered him a trustworthy businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 German newspapers criticized the banks for lending so freely to Schneider with 
so little scrutiny of his business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once again, one has to wonder about the behavior of the money houses: The 
bankers monitor medium-size companies minutely regarding credits, (and) with 
the big ones they turn two blind eyes," wrote the Berlin newspaper, Der 
Tagesspiegel. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, 120 banks were forced to put up about $2 billion to bail out the 
Metallgesellschaft metals and engineering group, which had about $5.5 billion 
of debt. Deutsche Bank was the biggest creditor there too and also a member of 
the board. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, most of the loans to Schneider are believed to be secured by 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure is not expected to hurt the banks as much as small businesses and 
workers, particularly in the eastern city of Leipzig, where Schneider had huge 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider was fond of buying dilapidated historical buildings and renovating 
them. But he would keep them and collect rents, rather than sell for high 
profits as is normal among developers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Design, this is my life's elixir," Schneider told the Frankfurter Rundschau 
newspaper in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 German newspapers and television reported workers on Schneider construction 
projects in tears and worried subcontractors pulling their machinery out of 
buildings that they feared might be seized by creditor banks. Schneider 
accounts are frozen, and company managers have no funds to pay workers or 
debts. 
</P>
<P>
 German television quoted the head of the state of Hesse, Hans Eichel, as 
saying that he had been told by Deutsche Bank's Chief Executive, Hilmar Kopper, 
that Schneider projects will be completed.

KIDNAPED MEXICAN FINANCIER MAKES PLEA FOR RANSOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kidnapers of financier Alfredo Harp Helu vowed in a published letter Thursday 
to execute the president of Mexico's biggest bank if a ransom is not paid 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't pay the ransom you will know you have made a mistake . . . when 
the body is in front of you," said the typed letter addressed to the board of 
directors of Banco Nacional de Mexico, known as Banamex. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter did not say how much ransom was being demanded. 
</P>
<P>
 The warning came with a second handwritten letter from Harp Helu that ended a 
monthlong public silence over the fate of the 50-year-old financier, whose 
abduction on March 14 rocked Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pay the ransom, my life is in danger," Harp Helu pleaded in a letter to bank 
executives, which was written in black ink and accompanied by a photograph of 
the gaunt-looking and bearded hostage. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters and photograph were retrieved in a packet found off a Mexico City 
street by the newspaper Reforma, acting on an anonymous telephone call. 
</P>
<P>
 Harp Helu's personal fortune has been estimated at as much as $1 billion.

FOREIGNERS, BELGIAN TROOPS FLY OUT OF SHATTERED RWANDA; AFRICA: MORTAR SHELLS 
FALL ON AIRPORT AS THEY BOARD PLANE. THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES STREAM INTO 
NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES.

 Mortar shells slammed into Kigali airport Thursday, threatening attempts by 
foreigners and Belgian troops to escape Rwanda's slide into gruesome anarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 As a tide of tribal slaughter raged into a second week, a total of 10 mortar 
rounds hit taxiways and the perimeter of the international airport while the 
last of 400 Belgian troops were pulling out. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the rounds screamed in while what Belgian officers said was the last 
planeload of 40 foreign passport-holders and journalists to leave the capital 
was boarding. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20,000 people are estimated to have died since fighting broke out 
between the army and the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front a week ago. The fighting 
and the mayhem in Kigali are deeply rooted in the decades-old feud between the 
majority Hutu and minority Tutsi ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the Rwandans wept during the flight to Nairobi, mourning slain 
relatives and reliving the horror of their escape from the city. Others simply 
stared in silence, too shocked to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 "More and more of the civilian population armed with machetes are ruling the 
streets, and the army can't control them," said Phillippe Gaillard of the 
International Committee of the Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 In Geneva, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent 
Societies said that at least 30 Rwandan Red Cross workers were killed in the 
fighting in Rwanda and that the toll could rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy fighting between the army and RPF rebels broke out at dawn Thursday and 
raged on for much of the day despite heavy showers. 
</P>
<P>
 Belgium was the only Western country with forces still in the remote central 
African state, a former Belgian colony. 
</P>
<P>
 Aid agencies said tens of thousands of refugees were fleeing into neighboring 
Tanzania, Burundi, Uganda and Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Rescue Committee humanitarian organization reported an 
eight-mile-long column of people streaming out of Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 About a third of the capital's 300,000 people are believed to have fled. 
</P>
<P>
 Amnesty International accused the United Nations and Western countries of not 
doing enough to protect Rwandans.

MEDIATION EFFORT COLLAPSES IN S. AFRICA; ELECTIONS: ZULU CHIEF'S DEMAND TO 
DELAY VOTING CAUSES INTERNATIONAL GROUP TO DROP MISSION TO DEFUSE CONFLICT IN 
NATAL PROVINCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A long-shot effort at international mediation to defuse the fierce 
pre-election conflict in Natal province collapsed in embarrassment and disarray 
here Thursday before the high-profile mediators had held their first formal 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, the leader of the seven foreign 
jurists, academics and diplomats, said the group was reluctantly abandoning its 
mission because of the apparently non-negotiable demand by Zulu Chief 
Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi that South Africa's first all-race elections be 
postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our group was unanimous that at no stage and under no circumstances would we 
involve ourselves with the question of the election date," Kissinger said. 
"That date is for South Africans themselves to decide. . . . We leave it to the 
politicians." 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by a private business group, the mediators arrived two days ago amid 
a fanfare of publicity as a last-minute attempt to forge a compromise between 
Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party, which is boycotting the April 26-28 
elections, and the African National Congress, which is expected to sweep the 
vote and head the first post-apartheid government. 
</P>
<P>
 The group flew in from six nations, apparently after being told that the ANC 
and Inkatha had hammered out an agreement Sunday on "terms of reference," or 
the stated guidelines, for mediation. 
</P>
<P>
 The visitors hoped to resolve the disputes over Inkatha's demands for 
constitutional amendments to provide for greater provincial autonomy and the 
restoration of the Zulu monarchy after the dismantlement of the 
apartheid-created Zulu homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 But on arriving, they found that the guidelines were still a matter of fierce 
debate because Inkatha insisted that the election be delayed as well, while the 
ANC and the government of President Frederik W. de Klerk adamantly refused. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we came here, we found that the terms of reference had either been 
reopened or were not fully agreed as we had believed," Kissinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 So instead of retiring to a game lodge Wednesday to mediate, the group cooled 
their heels in a Johannesburg hotel. Then Buthelezi appeared to harden his 
position, insisting that even if the mediation led to agreement on other 
issues, he wanted the balloting postponed so his party would have time to 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with the impasse that has bedeviled South Africans for months, the 
foreign mediators quickly threw in the towel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that it has failed fills me with sadness," said Lord Carrington, a 
former British foreign secretary and a mediator. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides, predictably, blamed the other for scuttling the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is quite clear to us that they (Inkatha) were entering into the mediation 
process with the sole objective that the elections be postponed," said Cyril 
Ramaphosa, the ANC's secretary general. 
</P>
<P>
 Inkatha's negotiator, Ben Ngubane, accused the ANC and the government of 
negotiating "in very, very bad, bad faith." He added: "The door has been 
slammed in our face. The chances of an inclusive negotiated settlement is over. 
I'm just as concerned as any other South African." 
</P>
<P>
 The debacle -- following the public failure of a peace summit last Friday 
among Mandela, Buthelezi, De Klerk and the Zulu king, Goodwill Zwelithini -- 
gives little reason to expect further compromise in the 12 days before the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 213 Zulus have died in factional fighting in Natal province -- the 
main battleground of the ANC-Inkatha rivalry -- since De Klerk declared a state 
of emergency there two weeks ago to curb the violence and ensure free 
campaigning.

RUSSIA POSTPONES JOINING PEACE PLAN; MILITARY: 'PARTNERSHIP' PROGRAM CALLS FOR 
COOPERATION WITH NATO. CLINTON ADMINISTRATION CONCERNED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The escalating warfare between Bosnian Serb forces and U.N. peacekeepers in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina claimed another casualty Thursday: plans for greater 
cooperation between Russia and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian Foreign Minister Andrei D. Kozyrev announced in Moscow that he has 
postponed Russia's entry into the "Partnership for Peace," President Clinton's 
program for increased cooperation between NATO and the former Communist nations 
of Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said the Clinton 
Administration is concerned about the Russian decision and hopes that it does 
not mean a definitive reversal of Russia's decision to join the partnership. 
Clinton has made Partnership for Peace the centerpiece of Western efforts to 
promote stability in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozyrev called off a scheduled April 21 visit to Brussels, where he was to 
enroll Russia in the program, and tied the decision to his government's 
complaint that it was not fully consulted in advance of NATO air strikes 
against Bosnian Serb positions earlier this week. He told reporters Thursday 
that Russia first needs to define its conditions for collaborating with NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are interested in much more serious relations, which would rule out 
surprises and unilateral measures, especially military ones, in those areas 
where we should be cooperating more closely," Kozyrev said. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior U.S. official said it was unclear whether Russia's decision to stay 
out of the partnership will last long. "There have been some indications that 
they would like to trade membership (in the partnership) for closer ties to 
Western economies . . . but we don't know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russians were upset by the NATO air strikes against the Serbs, and U.S. 
officials were annoyed by the Russians' reaction, he said. Nevertheless, the 
two governments are still cooperating in diplomatic efforts in Bosnia, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian special envoy Vitaly S. Churkin has been trying to persuade the 
Bosnian Serbs, who look to Russia as an ally, to return to peace talks, and the 
Administration backs his efforts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Serbs' abduction of U.N. peacekeepers Thursday only underscored the 
limits on Moscow's leverage -- coming only one day after Churkin announced that 
the Serbs assured him that they would not "throw down the gauntlet to the 
international community." 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that the Russians are working in furtherance of the objectives 
that we too have -- which is an end to the fighting wherever it's occurring . . 
. resumption of discussions about cessation of hostilities and continued 
pursuit of an overall political settlement that the international community can 
then help enforce," McCurry said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to suggest that on every aspect of the negotiation under way do 
we necessarily see things the same way," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Clinton urged the Bosnian Serbs to stop attacking U.N. 
peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Serbs would be making a mistake to start treating the United 
Nations and NATO forces as adverse combatants," Clinton said. "That is not what 
we are doing. We are trying to get them to honor their words." 
</P>
<P>
 McCurry denied that the Administration is threatening any specific retaliation 
for attacks on U.N. forces. But, he added, "I think the Serbs have come to know 
in the last several days that there is an 'or else.' "

NEW HEALTH REFORM COMPROMISE HINTED; LEGISLATION: TREASURY SECRETARY SAYS 
PLAN'S PHASE-IN COULD BE PROLONGED, AND BENEFITS PACKAGE CUT. CLINTON'S CORE 
ELEMENTS WOULD REMAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In perhaps a new signal of White House willingness to compromise on health 
care reform, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said Thursday that Congress might 
well prolong the full implementation period and even scale back the proposed 
standard benefits package. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bentsen also indicated that the Clinton Administration intends to stand by 
the three central elements of the President's proposal: mandatory work-based 
coverage, large consumer-based purchasing pools and caps on insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury secretary declined, however, to elaborate on possible areas of 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to do horse-trading with the committees here," Bentsen told 
health care reporters invited to the White House. "There's no question that 
there will be adjustments made by the committees." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bentsen also predicted that the final legislation "will have . . . the 
basic things that the Administration has proposed." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Bentsen who revealed in January the President's intention to compromise 
on a key issue. In a speech to business leaders the morning after Clinton's 
State of the Union Address, Bentsen said that the Administration was prepared 
to consider allowing many more corporations to opt out of the proposed 
insurance-buying alliances. Companies in the alliances would be able to pool 
their insurance-buying power to get lower premium rates for employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen's comments Thursday came during a frenetic day of posturing by various 
interest groups with a major stake in health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Treasury secretary was speaking to reporters, the National Federation 
of Independent Business -- one of the Administration's chief foes on health 
reform -- released a report predicting a job loss of between 850,000 and 4 
million if employers are required to provide coverage for their workers.  
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen disputed those numbers, saying: "I don't think that's going to happen. 
I think there'll be some shifting of jobs, but not a net job loss." 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Thursday, three dozen corporations and health, labor and senior groups 
sent letters to Congress urging it to support the employer mandate, which would 
require businesses to pay at least 80% of a worker's health insurance premiums, 
with individuals paying the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Clinton's proposal, firms would pay as much as 7.9% of their payrolls 
for health premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 The organizations that signed the letter called the mandate "the most 
practical and realistic approach" to universal coverage. They included the 
American Assn. of Retired Persons, Chrysler Corp., Ford Motor Co., the 
corporate parent of American Airlines, Archer Daniels Midland Co., Bethlehem 
Steel Co., USX Corp., the American Hospital Assn., the Catholic Health Assn., 
Safeway Inc., and the Assn. of Private Pension and Welfare Plans, which 
represents many Fortune 500 firms. 
</P>
<P>
 No provision in Clinton's 1,342-page Health Security Act has drawn as much 
opposition as the employer mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 The President and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton have said repeatedly that 
there is no other way to achieve universal coverage short of a broad-based tax 
or a requirement that individuals carry insurance -- both unacceptable to the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton wants to extend coverage to the estimated 38 million uninsured 
Americans by 1998. Bentsen declined Thursday to say whether the President is 
willing to delay that date, replying to a question about phasing-in of the 
mandate: "Obviously the shorter the better, from our standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the mandate, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National 
Assn. of Manufacturers, have warned that it would impose a crushing burden on 
small entrepreneurs and deter business start-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies on the job impact of an employer mandate have yielded wildly 
conflicting results, ranging from the independent business group's latest 
projection of 4 million lost jobs to claims of a job gain of 660,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office continued its economic analysis of 
the Clinton plan's leading rival, which was authored by Rep. Jim Cooper 
(D-Tenn.). Cooper's bill hews more closely to the theory of "managed 
competition," which holds that competition can be increased in the health care 
system by banding consumers into large purchasing cooperatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget office Director Robert Reischauer had said earlier that he expects the 
Cooper bill to increase the deficit more than the Clinton plan because it does 
not rely on government-imposed price controls. Cooper and his allies said that 
the budget office is not giving credit to the market forces that would be 
unleashed by his plan -- which already are working in some states to hold down 
medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget office is not expected to release its final report on the Cooper 
plan until next week. Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office disputed a 
report in Thursday's Washington Post that its preliminary estimates indicated 
that the Cooper bill would add roughly $150 billion to the deficit over six 
years. That would be about twice the increase it estimated for the President's 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can say quite clearly that those are not our numbers," spokesman Mark 
DeSautels said.

RETIREMENT AS 4-STAR ADMIRAL URGED FOR KELSO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended Thursday that Adm. Frank B. 
Kelso II, the Navy's top officer, be allowed to retire as a full admiral 
despite damage done to his record by the Tailhook scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 20-2 vote, the committee recommended to the full Senate that Kelso retire 
at four-star rank, as recommended by President Clinton. If the Senate accepts 
the recommendation, Kelso would retire with an annual pension of $84,340. 
Rejection of the proposal would mean that Kelso would retire at two-star rank, 
which would reduce his pension by $16,873. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the committee members accepted Kelso's statement that he did not 
witness any of the misconduct at the Las Vegas hotel where the 1991 Tailhook 
Assn. convention was held. The convention of Navy and Marine fliers led to 
scores of complaints by women that they were sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be totally out of character for him to deliberately deceive the 
investigators," Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sens. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) and Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex.) voted against 
the four-star retirement.

HIGH LEVELS OF STRESS REPORTED AMONG GAY AFRICAN AMERICANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 African American men and women who are gay suffer levels of stress that are 
exceeded only by members of that group who also have AIDS, and their emotional 
needs are not being met by mental health professionals, according to UCLA 
researchers. 
</P>
<P>
 And lesbian African Americans suffer from stress more than their gay 
counterparts, often contemplating suicide, said UCLA psychologist Vickie Mays, 
co-author of a report appearing this week in the American Journal of 
Psychiatry. 
</P>
<P>
 Study co-author Susan D. Cochran, a psychologist at Cal State Northridge and 
at the Institute for Social Science Research at UCLA, said Thursday that the 
20-question survey cannot diagnose depression. But it gives an indication of 
chronic strain, "a chronic feeling that life is hard." 
</P>
<P>
 The findings were based on levels of depressive distress measured through such 
indicators as the blues, loneliness, fears, physical symptoms, relationship 
problems and frequency of suicidal thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey of 829 men and 603 women who identified themselves as homosexually 
active African Americans showed them to have substantially higher levels of 
chronic strain than heterosexual blacks or whites. The comparisons were based 
on studies of depressive distress among straight and gay white men and straight 
blacks of both sexes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This study shows that distress and depression are problems that for African 
American homosexually active men and women have gone unaddressed," Mays said. 
"Clearly, homosexually active men and women represent a highly stressed 
population with specific needs for mental health intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a population we haven't heard from before," she added. "African American 
gay men are just coming to our attention as a result of HIV."

RISING MIDWEST RIVERS CHASE HUNDREDS FROM THEIR HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Meramec River surged higher Thursday, threatening an interstate highway, 
and some residents driven from their homes for the third time in a year waited 
out the high water at a church shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wrap your lifetime around a house," said Jim Thayer, who has lived here 
since 1953. "But it's getting so expensive to rebuild that a lot of people are 
going to have to give up." 
</P>
<P>
 Midwestern rivers fattened on snowmelt and fed by days of spring rains flowed 
out of their banks this week, forcing people from their homes and reviving 
memories of last summer's devastating floods. 
</P>
<P>
 The flooding has been blamed for four deaths in Missouri and one each in 
Illinois and Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
 Thayer and his neighbors, who took shelter at Sacred Heart Church, cheered 
when they heard that the National Weather Service had downgraded its crest 
prediction for the Meramec. Instead of cresting at 39 feet today, it topped out 
at 37.4 feet Thursday night -- 21 feet above flood stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Meramec has already forced about 1,000 people -- one-fourth of the town -- 
from their homes and threatened to sweep over Interstate 44, which slices 
diagonally across the state from Springfield northeast to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 In southern Illinois, several families were plucked to safety by helicopter 
after the Mississippi River pushed through a levee near Miller City. Hours 
earlier, crews had finished adding 10 feet to the levee to reinforce it. 
</P>
<P>
 In Prairie du Rocher in southwestern Illinois, residents piled sandbags atop a 
levee holding back the Kaskaskia River. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't want our house to get flooded again," said Erin Huntley, a high 
school freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 The retreating Embarras River left a slimy, brown mixture of mud, water, 
gasoline and oil coating the streets of Villa Grove in east-central Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of the town's 1,000 homes were flooded, and the water supply 
was tainted. On Main Street, residents filled jugs from a 1,200-gallon tank of 
drinking water perched on a trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois officials called up 150 members of the National Guard and another 
1,000 were on standby. 
</P>
<P>
 In St. Louis, the Mississippi River crested at 6.5 feet over flood stage.

NEWSPAPER EDITORS CONVENE, AND ARE TORN BY DOUBTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS B. ROSENSTIEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's newspaper editors, gathering here for their annual convention, 
seemed racked by collective anxiety about nearly everything. 
</P>
<P>
 In their formal panel discussions and their less formal gatherings around 
hotel bars and lobbies, participants at the American Society of Newspaper 
Editors meeting expressed uncertainty about the content of their papers, about 
cost-cutting pressures from publishers, and about readers' opinions of the 
press. At a well-attended session on political correctness in the newsroom, 
they heard themselves criticized for being at once too liberal and too 
conservative -- too mean and too cowardly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone is searching for what is the next path, the next door, for 
the industry, said Maggie Balough, of the Austin (Tex.) American-Statesman. 
"The answers used to be more readily on people's tongues and some of these old, 
quick solutions don't seem so helpful." 
</P>
<P>
 In a panel entitled "Are Newspapers on the Right Track?" Eugene C. Patterson, 
the former editor of the St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times had harsh words for the 
very things editors have emphasized at these gatherings for a decade -- namely 
color graphics and short writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The newspapers on the wrong track have a certain set of characteristics: They 
are trying to mimic their electronic competitors. . . . They are given to short 
takes instead of explanation of complex issues. . . . They tend to be too 
spooked by the electronic superhighway and fail to look at our strengths and 
their weaknesses," Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 What then, the panel moderator asked, should editors say to publishers who 
suggest that people -- especially young people -- are increasingly pressed for 
time and no longer read long articles. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the best arguments is to look at history," argued Eugene L. Roberts, 
the newly appointed managing editor of the New York Times, who has criticized 
the industry's drift away from writing and content. "There was a big movement 
toward tight writing and an abhorrence of stories that jumped pages in the 
1950s and 1960s," and it passed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The day President John F. Kennedy was killed in Dallas, the Dallas Morning 
News had a rule that no story could jump, he pointed out. "One of the most 
important stories of this century occurred in their city, and they didn't jump 
the goddamn story!" 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the editorial direction of their papers, the editors expressed 
uncertainty about the tone of their political coverage. Even the president of 
the group, William A. Hilliard, the retiring editor of the Portland Oregonian, 
warned the editors about "a cancer of mean-spiritedness." 
</P>
<P>
 What is mean and what is not, however, is unclear, as epitomized by the 
reactions to an encounter between one member and President Clinton on 
Wednesday. The editor asked whether the President's sometimes faltering answers 
to questions about the Whitewater land deal sounded like a child who made 
excuses for failing to do her homework. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the perfect question," whispered one editor at a nearby table. 
Surprised, the editor next to him turned and said angrily: "That is an 
obnoxious question." 
</P>
<P>
 In another expression of their concern over the role of newspapers, editors 
invited as speakers two prominent public figures who recently charged that 
press malice and laziness drive good people from public service. 
</P>
<P>
 C. Lani Guinier, the University of Pennsylvania law professor who was 
nominated to be assistant attorney general for civil rights, attacked the 
reporters who covered her for being ignorant and unwilling to learn her real 
views. Bobby Ray Inman, who withdrew his name as nominee for defense secretary 
earlier this year, recounted what he called inaccuracies and knowing disregard 
of the truth in the coverage of him. 
</P>
<P>
 The editors also expressed uncertainty over issues involving the use of 
language and photographs. In a session on political correctness, editors were 
told about a newspaper that refused to report in a headline that former Lakers 
star Magic Johnson had vowed he would "beat" AIDS. The reason? Some staff 
members feared it would give people with AIDS false hope.  
</P>
<P>
 Scholar Elizabeth Fox-Genovese said that the press is "giving in to threats" 
from the left and accused the media of failing to adequately cover conservative 
views in the black community and anti-abortion sentiment in the nation. She 
also complained that coverage of feminism too often is limited to the views of 
the National Organization for Women and the National Abortion Rights Action 
League. 
</P>
<P>
 Many editors seemed to agree. Bob Haiman, the president of the Poynter 
Institute in Florida, said that he had written to 55 editors he knew asking 
whether they thought political correctness was "killing open debate in their 
newsrooms." Of the 41 respondents, 38 said yes.

GAMBLING GOVERNOR WON $308,000 IN '93 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Edwin W. Edwards won $308,000 at the gaming tables last year, according 
to his 1993 federal income tax return released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's salary is set by law at $73,440, although Edwards drew only 
$64,995 of that last year, the return showed. 
</P>
<P>
 An ardent supporter of legalized gambling in Louisiana as the answer to the 
state's fiscal woes, Edwards periodically holds high-stakes poker games at the 
governor's mansion and plays at Las Vegas casinos. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor releases his tax returns annually to fulfill a campaign promise. 
His income from gambling was $126,000 higher in 1993 than in 1992, according to 
his returns. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to horse racing, Louisiana has legalized off-track betting, video 
poker, a statewide lottery, riverboat gambling and a land-based casino in New 
Orleans.

D'AMATO'S SENATE FLOOR ATTACK ON CLINTON DRAWS SWIFT REBUKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Whitewater controversy overflowed onto the Senate floor Thursday when Sen. 
Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.), one of President Clinton's most acerbic critics on 
the subject, accused the President of hypocrisy for seeking to raise taxes for 
most Americans while dodging his own. 
</P>
<P>
 The caustic attack drew immediate rebuke from Senate Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell (D-Me.), who accused D'Amato of debasing the tradition of Senate 
debates by making knowingly false and distorted allegations to score political 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 In his remarks, D'Amato said: "The President has sought to tax everything that 
moves and some things that don't. . . . Now that the President has raised 
everyone else's taxes, we discover that he had not paid all of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like the President never met a tax he didn't like -- except his 
own," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although such combative sarcasm is not unusual for D'Amato, it was a measure 
of the partisan tension that Whitewater has aroused in the Senate that Mitchell 
strode quickly to the floor to issue what was for him an unusually stinging 
rebuke. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking issue with the assertion that Clinton had raised "everyone else's 
taxes," Mitchell said that D'Amato "surely knew his statements to be obviously 
false and untrue" but made them to "cause political damage and embarrassment" 
to the President. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whitewater, Whitewater, Whitewater. That is the Republican program in the 
spring of 1994," Mitchell said, accusing the Republicans of seeking to use the 
Clintons' involvement in a real estate venture in the Ozarks to sabotage health 
care reform and other items on the Administration's agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the partisan tension lay a dispute over when and how the Senate will 
honor Republican demands for hearings into the tangled Whitewater events. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) is pressing Mitchell to agree to 
appoint a special committee to begin Whitewater hearings as early as next 
month. But Mitchell, while promising hearings, has said they can occur only 
when Robert B. Fiske Jr., the special counsel named to investigate Whitewater, 
indicates that a public inquiry will not endanger his criminal investigation.

OWL HABITAT PLAN FILED; OK FOR LOGGING SOUGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration on Thursday filed a plan to protect the old-growth 
habitat of the northern spotted owl and asked a judge to lift a ban that has 
halted federal timber sales in the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plan outlines a strategy for preserving our natural resources, while 
recognizing the role timber plays in the Northwest economy," Agriculture 
Secretary Mike Espy said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the forest plan, Administration officials said they filed a 
motion asking U.S. District Judge William Dwyer in Seattle to lift his 1991 
order banning sales of federal timber in the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of timber on federal land in Washington, Oregon and Northern California 
have been virtually halted since the order was issued in connection with a 1989 
lawsuit filed by environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "We applaud President Clinton's efforts," Audubon Society Vice President Brock 
Evans said. "However, we are disappointed by his failure to fully protect the 
country's last remaining ancient forest, salmon and other old-growth dependent 
species."

SEOUL DROPS ENVOY EXCHANGE AS CONDITION FOR NUCLEAR DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking to break a tense nuclear standoff with its rival to the north, South 
Korea said today that it would no longer press North Korea to exchange envoys 
as a precondition for further talks. 
</P>
<P>
 The envoy swap, along with full nuclear inspections, has been a key 
precondition for high-level talks between the United States and North Korea on 
improving ties and resolving the dispute over the North's suspected nuclear 
weapons development program. 
</P>
<P>
 While showing keen interest in improving ties with the United States, the 
hard-line Communist state has refused to exchange envoys with Seoul, arguing 
that its capitalist rival has no right to get involved in the nuclear dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Seoul officials said the move to drop the demand for an envoy exchange would 
put more pressure on Pyongyang to clear suspicions over its nuclear program, 
which it insists is peaceful, by opening all of its nuclear facilities to 
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "North Korea's attitude clearly shows that it has no interest to exchange 
envoys," Unification Minister Lee Yung-duk said after a meeting of 
security-related Cabinet officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Tensions have been high on the Korean peninsula over suspicions that the North 
is developing nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Pyongyang denies the allegations, but its yearlong refusal to allow U.N. 
inspections of suspected sites has heightened suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Seoul officials, North Korea has deployed 80% of its 1.1 million 
troops and more than 8,000 artillery and rocket systems closer to the border 
with South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Seoul, where one-fourth of South Koreans live, is within an hour's drive of 
the border. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Koreas never signed a peace treaty after the three-year Korean War 
ended in 1953.

FLASHLIGHT MAGNATE VOWS TO CARE FOR PARTNER; COURTS: BUT BUSINESSMAN INSISTS HE

 Sobbing on the witness stand and cradling his head in his hands, flashlight 
magnate Anthony Maglica vowed at his palimony trial Thursday to care for Claire 
Maglica until the day she dies, but he insisted that he has no legal obligation 
to do so.  
</P>
<P>
 "I ask this jury to believe that I will provide for Claire as long as she 
lives, so she will never have to work. This I feel I will do, so God help me," 
said Anthony Maglica, 64. "I feel so ashamed, like a child -- to cry -- but 
inside of me I hurt, because I know the truth."

 The Maglicas were never married, but Claire, now 60, took Anthony's name and 
they lived together for 23 years. She says she deserves half of Mag Instrument 
Inc., a $300-million flashlight empire they built together, because Anthony 
Maglica promised her from the time they met in 1971 that they would share 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
 He maintains that Mag Instrument Inc. belongs entirely to him and that he 
never promised her anything during their lengthy relationship. Still smarting 
from a divorce settlement when he met Claire Maglica, Anthony Maglica said he 
was adamant about never losing control of his money, and in 1977 the couple 
signed an agreement to keep their assets separate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ladies and gentlemen, believe me. I work hard for my business, and I never 
wanted to again split it with anyone," he testified. "I didn't pull any tricks 
on Claire or anybody else. . . . I have been fair to Claire. I treated her 
better than any husband would." 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts say that if Claire Maglica prevails, she could be awarded the 
largest palimony judgment ever. Since common-law marriage is not recognized in 
California, the case hinges on breach of contract, and whether jurors believe 
Claire's version of the 1971 oral agreement, or Anthony's version of the 1977 
written one -- which her attorneys contend is fraudulent. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, Anthony Maglica's attorney, Dennis M. Wasser, sought to have Orange 
County Superior Court Judge Robert J. Polis dismiss the case partly because the 
evidence presented by Claire's attorneys has revolved around common-law 
marriages, not breaches of contract. Polis denied the motion. 
</P>
<P>
 While Anthony Maglica testified that he "had no intention of dumping Claire, 
and she knows that," her attorney, John W. Keker, suggested during his 
cross-examination that she only believed as much because she trusted his 
promise to share all their assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Keker alleges that Claire Maglica's trust eroded when he told her in January, 
1992, that she was merely his employee, not his wife or business partner. Until 
that time, Keker says, Anthony Maglica treated Claire like a wife and co-owner 
of the Ontario-based, 600-employee company, where she is still executive vice 
president. She claims to have supervised advertising, marketing and packaging. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maglicas, Keker suggested, were the only ones at the company not 
participating in the employee profit-sharing plan. Anthony Maglica set Claire's 
salary in such a way as to reinforce her belief that she is entitled to half of 
everything, Keker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was paid like a wife, wasn't she?" Keker asked Anthony Maglica in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wasn't paid like a wife. She was paid like my best friend," Maglica 
answered, adding that she was "well compensated" and could have built a nest 
egg with her salary.

SCHOOL TRUSTEE FACES DRUG, DRUNK DRIVING CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police pulled over a school board trustee for erratic driving and in his van 
found illegal drugs and videotapes of sex partners, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon E. Flores, 42, a member of the New Haven district board for nine years, 
was charged Thursday with misdemeanor counts of possession of methamphetamine 
and driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs. But Alameda County 
prosecutors did not charge him in connection with the tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he is an elected official, he cannot be removed from the school board 
unless he is convicted or resigns, Supt. Guy Emanuele said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it certainly isn't the kind of role model that you'd want in any 
organization that deals with children," Emanuele said.  
</P>
<P>
 Police said they discovered homemade videotapes of several women, including 
Flores' wife, taken on a water bed in his Union City home. The tapes were in a 
bag marked with the name of a private school that Flores owns. 
</P>
<P>
 "His wife says she did not know she was being videotaped," Police Capt. Mike 
Lanam said. "She's offered to help identify the other women if she can." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Flores told them "at least two of the three knew I was doing it 
(taping) at the time," Lanam said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are trying to contact the women to determine if they were taped without 
their knowledge, which would be illegal. And Lanam said Flores may have made 
additional tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are possibly other victims out there," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Lanam said police had received several earlier reports that Flores was selling 
and using methamphetamines, and found a bag containing the drugs in his van. 
They asked him if he sold the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got out of that four or five weeks ago," police quoted Flores as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no indication that Flores sold any drugs at schools, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Flores was stopped at 1:45 a.m. Wednesday when officers spotted 
him making erratic U-turns. The officers said his pupils were dilated and that 
he smelled of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 He owns a private elementary school named Free to Be II, and has been on the 
board since 1985.

O.C. TREASURER SAYS CRITICS PERIL COUNTY'S CREDIT RATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County Treasurer Robert L. Citron charged Thursday that his political 
opponents have embarked on a "dangerous" course to undermine the county's 
financial standing with an influential Wall Street credit rating service. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron said the political attack has been led by Chriss Street, a Newport 
Beach contributor to the treasurer's opponent in the upcoming election, 
financial planner John M. W. Moorlach. Street acknowledged that in several 
recent phone calls to Standard & Poors Ratings Group in New York, the Wall 
Street Journal and Forbes magazine, he has expressed concern about the safety 
and stability of the county's $7.5-billion portfolio, managed by Citron's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron's political opponents said they saw nothing wrong with the contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Citron said Street's allegations could damage the county's credit rating, 
which could in turn force 187 school districts, cities and other public 
agencies -- all members of the county investment pool -- to pay millions more 
in interest costs to borrow money in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like somebody passing on false information about a financial 
institution, causing a run on the bank," Citron said. "These kinds of people 
are dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Citron, facing the first opposition for his seat in 24 years, has been under 
intense attack from Moorlach in recent weeks over his investment strategies. 
His allegations in an interview Thursday marked his first major offensive in 
the increasingly bitter campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 His comments came one day after it was disclosed that the city of Tustin has 
pulled out its entire $4-million stake in the county's investment pool because 
of potentially risky investments. The city's move was coordinated in part by 
Tustin Councilman Jeffrey Thomas, a political ally of Moorlach who serves on 
his campaign finance committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Street, himself a former candidate for the county treasurer, confirmed 
Thursday that he has made at least half a dozen calls to Standard & Poors to 
discuss Citron's management of pool funds, specifically $50 million in bonds 
borrowed by the Newport-Mesa School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorlach said he talked with Street about his inquiries, adding that he 
believed Street acted out of concern for his own community and in support of 
the campaign against Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe there is some synergy there," Moorlach said. 
</P>
<P>
 Street, chairman of a local health care company that operates 10 hospitals 
around the country, said he fears that a risky investment strategy used by the 
county could endanger the bonds and leave the Newport-Mesa school district in 
default. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (Citron) would like to sue me for slander," Street said, "then tell him to 
come on down. But I'm looking at the possibility of my kids going to schools 
with no teachers. I'm concerned about the schools in my community. In the event 
of a default on these bonds, who takes the loss?" 
</P>
<P>
 The school district borrowed the bonds last year and gave them to the county 
pool to reinvest in hopes of earning a higher rate of return. Street said he 
told Standard & Poors of his fears about the county's use of an investment 
strategy called a "reverse repurchase agreement." He said the strategy could 
endanger the school funds during a time of rising interest rates and 
fluctuating stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the complex strategy, the investor typically borrows U.S. Treasury bonds 
against existing collateral and then sells them to invest in higher-yielding 
bonds. As long as the investor borrows at a lower rate than the return on the 
security in which it invests, the strategy remains profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron said he has been using the tactic for at least 15 years without failure 
and promises Newport-Mesa that it will earn $1 million on its investment by 
June 15. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Street, who declined to comment about his discussions with reporters 
at the Wall Street Journal and Forbes magazine, said Citron's techniques should 
be the subject of greater scrutiny, especially during uncertain financial 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing worse than a gambler who goes to Vegas and wins the first 
time," Street said in reference to Citron. "The next time he's back with all 
the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Brosen, of Standard & Poors' municipal finance department in New York, 
said she spoke with Street at least three times in the past two months but 
remains fully confident in the Orange County accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Brosen said she had been in close touch with Orange County officials during 
the past few weeks, adding that the county's credit rating remains "very high 
and very strong" with Standard & Poors. Orange County maintains a AA credit 
rating, with AAA the highest mark. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have confidence in Mr. Citron," Brosen said. "We have confidence that the 
notes issued by Orange County will be paid in full." 
</P>
<P>
 While carrying some risk, reverse repurchase agreements are widely used as 
investment tools by managers of public funds, financial analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The treasurer's race has become a most unlikely venue for the recent string of 
political charges and countercharges exchanged so far this season. It is 
traditionally a low-profile office that attracts little or no attention at 
campaign time.  
</P>
<P>
 Citron, the 68-year-old treasurer, is the only Democrat holding elective 
office in county government, and he described the recent developments as part 
of a "grand political scheme" by local Republicans to discredit him.  
</P>
<P>
 The machinations, he maintained, included the city of Tustin's recent decision 
to withdraw about $4 million from the county investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they ordered the pullout, citing concerns for the county's 
use of reverse repurchase agreements as investment tools. Councilman Thomas, 
the Moorlach ally, played a role in the decision to withdraw, but Tustin 
Treasurer Ronald A. Nault said politics was not involved in the ultimate 
transfer of funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Nault said the city's decision was not meant as a comment on Citron's ability 
but only a reflection of the city's extremely conservative financial 
philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Citron and Assistant Orange County Treasurer Matthew R. Raabe 
said they have spent much time recently answering questions about the county's 
portfolio from reporters, Wall Street firms and a range of government 
officials. Those questions, officials believe, have been prompted by charges 
from Moorlach's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way they can win is to try to convince people that we are doing 
something wrong," Citron said. "Your credit rating is a reflection of your 
position in the marketplace. These are very dangerous attacks these guys are 
making. . . . The sky isn't falling."

WILDFLOWER RULING A BLOW TO VALLEY GOLF COURSE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal wildlife officials have ruled that a proposal by a controversial 
Japanese developer to build a championship golf course in Big Tujunga Wash, one 
of urban Los Angeles' most environmentally sensitive areas, would jeopardize 
endangered wildflowers found in the rugged stream course. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-awaited decision by the Fish & Wildlife Service deals a blow to plans 
of Cosmo World Inc. to build an 18-hole course in Big Tujunga Wash, located in 
the extreme northern part of the city of Los Angeles and marked by rugged 
terrain and, during rainy periods, fierce flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling increases the likelihood that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 
which has jurisdiction over the wash, will not issue the permit needed for the 
$50-million project to be built as planned by the developer, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing that says they can't override our biological opinion, but 
they rarely do," said wildlife service biologist John Hanlon, who has worked on 
the Cosmo World golf course project for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very much a biological opinion reached after consultation with the 
corps," said Cynthia Barry, associate manager of endangered species for the 
Pacific region office of the Fish & Wildlife Service. "We wouldn't have 
anything in there (the opinion) that the corps didn't think was reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
 The developer is now studying the decision and deciding what to do next, said 
Mark Armbruster, an attorney for Cosmo World. A Cosmo executive did not return 
phone calls Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the Corps of Engineers also did not return phone calls about 
the status of the project. The corps must issue a permit before the project 
could be built. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it makes it very clear that there won't be a development here," said 
state Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), whose district includes the wash. "A 
lot of us in the Valley consider the wash to be a significant open space. It's 
the last free-flowing river in the area." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now with the developer's eyes opened by this decision, I want to sit down 
with him and with the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and see if we can't 
put the wash in the hands of the park system." 
</P>
<P>
 Cosmo World is owned by the reclusive Japanese business magnate Minoru 
Isutani. Cosmo World, which has owned numerous golf properties in Japan, has 
had bad luck with its golf ventures in California, starting with its 
$841-million purchase of the Pebble Beach resort near Monterey in 1990. After 
two years, Cosmo sold the Pebble Beach property for a reported $341-million 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 At Big Tujunga Wash, Cosmo planned to build a championship golf course so 
stunning and challenging that it would lure the L.A. Open from its longstanding 
venue at the Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades, backers said. The 
company developed a cadre of supporters in the Sunland-Tujunga communities who 
claimed the golf course would give a much-needed economic shot in the arm to 
their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the recently issued finding, construction of the Cosmo golf 
course in Big Tujunga Wash "is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of 
the slender-horned spineflower." 
</P>
<P>
 A federal endangered species, the tiny spineflower grows in alluvial scrub 
habitat -- which is itself a rapidly disappearing ecosystem. The Big Tujunga 
Wash area is also identified in the city's General Plan as one of a half-dozen 
areas that are "ecologically important." 
</P>
<P>
 To protect its golf course from being devastated by flooding, Cosmo proposed 
channeling and deepening Big Tujunga Wash. But this system of waterworks -- in 
conjunction with the existing Oro Vista levee -- would interrupt the periodic 
flooding of the acreage where the spineflower grows. Such flooding is critical, 
the biologists have contended, to the spineflower's existence. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of these (flood control) features would result in an alteration of the 
current dynamic hydrological regime of the Big Tujunga Wash flood plain 
critical to the long-term perpetuation of Dodecahema leptoceras (the 
spineflower)," the 29-page report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 To answer the agency's concerns, the developer proposed setting aside 78 acres 
within the golf course as a spineflower preserve. But this proposal, the 
biologists predicted, would be inadequate to sustain the population and would 
be "bisected by golf course features and a (golf) cart path." 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, Cosmo offered to try growing spineflower plants on another site 
of 100 acres located downstream from the golf course. But the wildlife agency 
biologists asserted that there is no assurance that the spineflower would 
survive replanting. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the only way to build a golf course on the Cosmo site and save the 
spineflower would be to establish a 203-acre spineflower preserve next to the 
wash that would be "adequately buffered from direct or indirect effects of golf 
activities" and deeded to "a responsible public or private resource management 
entity," according to the agency opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Under this configuration, the golf course would be placed in the southern 
portion of the property and separated from the preserve by a new flood levee. 
Moreover, the agency insisted that the existing Oro Vista levee be removed. 
</P>
<P>
 The issuance of a jeopardy opinion, one which concludes that a project is 
likely to adversely affect an endangered species, is a rarity itself. "Our 
region issued 496 formal biological opinions in 1993, and I could count on one 
hand the number that were jeopardy opinions," said Barry of the wildlife 
agency. The region Barry oversees comprises six states -- California, Nevada, 
Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Cosmo -- frustrated by years of infighting with bureaucracies -- last year 
threatened to invoke a little-known law that, it said, gave it the right to 
remove the spineflower from its property. But after environmentalists and 
lawmakers protested, Cosmo backed down. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, The Times reported that then-Mayor Tom Bradley, who received nearly 
$30,000 in campaign contributions from Cosmo World and its affiliates, and his 
aides had intervened on several occasions with Planning Department executives 
to expedite the review of the complicated project.

LANDLORD ACCUSED OF ARSON CLAIMS HE IS JUST A SCAPEGOAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The La Habra landlord accused of setting two of his apartment buildings on 
fire and attempting to burn another proclaimed his innocence in a jailhouse 
interview Thursday and said fire investigators are making him a scapegoat 
because they can't find anyone else to blame for the blazes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at the police report and I said to myself, 'My God, I don't do 
that.' They never have proof," said Gheorghe Alexandroai, a 63-year-old 
Romanian immigrant. "Police not found anybody else, so they think the owner is 
guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexandroai pleaded not guilty Tuesday to eight arson-related charges and is 
being held at the Orange County Jail on $1-million bail. Alexandroai allegedly 
set the two fires and twice attempted to burn another building to collect 
insurance payments, Orange County Fire Battalion Chief Dan Runnestrand said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 During a half-hour interview in the jail, Alexandroai, dressed in an orange 
jail uniform, appeared calm, repeatedly and emphatically denying all the 
accusations against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not true," he said, shaking his head. "Absolutely not true." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexandroai said he believes disgruntled tenants he evicted at each location 
are responsible for starting fires that damaged five of his properties in the 
past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have evidence of evictions in each building that caught fire," he said. "I 
believe people were against me. These people got me in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexandroai was arrested shortly after an April 7 blaze that caused $50,000 
damage to one of his eight-unit apartment complexes on Ball Road in Anaheim. 
Prosecutors contend that Alexandroai set that fire and another one in January 
that caused $12,000 damage to a building in the 8600 block of Cerritos Avenue 
in Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexandroai is also charged with attempted arson on Nov. 18 and March 2 at a 
second property he owns in the 1500 block of Ball Road in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Riverside County authorities have reopened their investigation of 
a September, 1992, fire at a single-family home in Mira Loma owned by 
Alexandroai. The fire was originally attributed to electrical problems and 
caused $25,000 in damage, mainly to the home's attic. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said there are also similarities between those fires and an 
early morning blaze in August, 1992, at another apartment building Alexandroai 
owns in the 8600 block of Cerritos Avenue in Stanton. Alexandroai has not been 
charged in that fire, which was also attributed to electrical problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't officially reopened our investigation of that fire," Runnestrand 
said. "But we have taken note of the similarities, and it's possible that he 
could be charged." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors also have said they are considering whether to file attempted 
murder charges against Alexandroai. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire investigators from Garden Grove, Anaheim and the Orange County Fire 
Department began comparing notes last month after they noticed the similarities 
in the incidents at the buildings owned by Alexandroai. 
</P>
<P>
 They were preparing to serve a search warrant against him when the April 7 
fire on Ball Road occurred, officials said. On March 2, the search warrant 
said, firefighters responding to tenants' calls that they smelled gasoline at 
1541 W. Ball Road in Anaheim found seven one-gallon plastic milk jugs filled 
with gasoline in the attic. 
</P>
<P>
 They also found plastic cat litter pans that contained gasoline and receipts 
for some of the items, allegedly purchased at a store half a mile from 
Alexandroai's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexandroai said Thursday that he knew nothing about the milk jugs and had not 
bought them. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no deaths or injuries in any of the fires. But in the two most 
recent ones, tenants, some of whom were sleeping, were quickly evacuated from 
the buildings by other residents and firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Many tenants expressed shock and anger after learning of the landlord's arrest 
last week. Alexandroai said he is willing to relocate any fire victims into 
vacant units in his other buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank God, nobody is dead," he said. "I feel very bad. I don't understand 
anything that happened. I put my hands on my heart and I say I don't understand 
anything that happened." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have portrayed Alexandroai as a threat to society, a man who 
showed little regard for life and property when he allegedly set the fires. 
They asked that his bail be set at $1 million because they fear that he may 
flee to his native Romania, where his three grown sons live. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Alexandroai described himself as a hard-working man who has never 
had trouble with the law during his 20 years in the United States, "except for 
a few parking tickets." He also said he has no intention of trying to leave the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pay my bills ahead of time," he said. "I've never had a problem with a bank 
or with credit cards or for not paying anything. I take care of my business." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexandroai said he has about $1.5 million in assets and has no reason to want 
to collect insurance money. In 1992, he received $217,000 in insurance money 
from Farmer's Insurance Group for a fire at one of his Stanton properties, 
according to the search warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't take that money for myself," Alexandroai said of the settlement. 
"People think I put that money in my pocket. That money went to a contractor" 
who, Alexandroai said, repaired the building. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to the search warrant, a Stanton building inspector told 
investigators that the repairs made with the insurance money were unnecessary 
or upgrades that tenants had asked for before the fire struck. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted on all charges, Alexandroai faces up to 20 years in prison. But 
that possibility did not appear to worry him Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe I will never have to be in jail, because they have to prove this," 
he said. "I can prove that I was not there. I was home when the Fire Department 
called."

WOMAN DENIES RUNNING HOTEL PROSTITUTION RING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO ROMERO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman who police say ran a prostitution ring out of a local hotel denied the 
allegation in a jailhouse interview Thursday, saying she was just "one of the 
working girls" who took orders from another woman in charge of the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Cira Rauda Sanchez, 18, a Mexican national, was arrested at the Granada Inn 
Hotel last week, together with six other women and four teen-age girls, 
following a police undercover operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rauda faces more serious charges than the rest of the group, which police say 
was recruited largely from Mexico. But she offered a far different account 
Thursday of her role than the portrait presented by authorities earlier this 
week in announcing her arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 She claimed in the interview that she was simply one of the prostitutes 
working at the hotel under the supervision of a woman she called Ellie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was mistaken for the woman who (handled) the girls," she said, adding that 
she thinks Ellie might have set her up. On the night of her arrest, she said, 
Ellie asked her to take over the operation for "an hour or two" before the 
police raid. 
</P>
<P>
 She claims Ellie and two other women then escaped through the hotel rooms' 
back windows when they saw the police arrive. She did not think Ellie had been 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Rauda said she found it relatively simple to run the operation for those two 
hours. She had to show photos of some dozen prostitutes to clients, charge them 
a fee of $70 to $80 once they made their choices, and send them to the right 
room at the motel, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "But I was not in charge of anything. I was one of the working girls," she 
said, adding that she was regularly paid to have sex with six to seven men each 
day.  
</P>
<P>
 But police investigators said Rauda was the one who regularly handled the 
operations at the hotel for a ring that might operate in other areas of the 
county. They said they are also investigating any connection between the ring 
and the owner of the hotel, Ravji Patel, who could not be reached for comment.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Matt Anderson said Thursday that he might take Rauda's 
statements into consideration in prosecuting the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evidence we have is sufficient to file the charges we did," Anderson 
said, "(But) clearly, we are still looking at this case (and) and I am willing 
to listen to what she has to say (through) her lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 Rauda's court-appointed attorney, Deputy Public Defender Ronald Klar, declined 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Rauda pleaded not guilty Monday to 20 felony counts of pimping and pandering. 
Her preliminary hearing is scheduled for April 22 in Orange County Municipal 
Court in Fullerton, and she could face a maximum of about 10 years in prison if 
convicted on all charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The other six adult women pleaded guilty Monday to misdemeanor counts of 
living in a house of prostitution and were sentenced to 10 days in jail and 
placed on three years' probation. The teen-age defendants remain in custody at 
the county's Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Rauda said Thursday that she had been working at the hotel since March 28, 
only days after she and a female friend were recruited for the job in Mexico 
and then took a bus from San Jacinto, in the west coast state of Guerrero, 
Mexico, en route to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The recruiter, she said, was a tall, handsome woman with short hair who 
approached her and her friend as they were leaving an adult school and asked 
them if they knew anyone who needed a good job. 
</P>
<P>
 The recruiter soon revealed what the job entailed, telling them that she 
herself had made $6,000 to $7,000 in three months as a prostitute, Rauda said. 
Attracted by the prospects of making good money in such a short time, she and 
her friend quickly accepted, Rauda said. 
</P>
<P>
 The recruiter bought them each a pair of jeans, a blouse and tennis shoes for 
the bus trip to Tijuana, which cost $125 each. When they arrived in Tijuana 
around March 25, she said, they were met at the bus station by an elegant blond 
woman wearing black pants and jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, they heard the woman telling them their wages depended on their 
performance, and they froze, Rauda said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said she had spent a lot of money on us and we had to come through," she 
said. "I began to feel afraid. We had no other choice. We knew no one there (in 
Tijuana). We had no money. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friend had told me she had heard several girls (from their hometown) had 
made the trip but had not returned and were never seen again, and I imagined 
the same thing could happen to us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, Rauda said, a "coyote" or alien-smuggler hired by the prostitution ring 
smuggled her and her friend into the United States at night through the hills 
south of San Diego. She and the friend, who Rauda said is one of the juveniles 
in custody, were then dropped at a house in San Ysidro. From there they were 
taken to the hotel in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Rauda said she has a 10-month-old boy whom she left with her grandparents in 
San Jacinto and has yet to baptize. The need to sustain their families amid 
"lots of poverty," she said, forced her and the other women to prostitute 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 While she was in school, Rauda said, she worked as a maid in well-to-do homes 
for $5 a day. "You know what you can buy with $5 today in Mexico? Almost 
nothing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all came to make money to send it back to Mexico. Our families have great 
needs," she said. "I repent for what I did, but what else could I do?"

NATURAL REORDER OF THINGS; FARMLAND CONVERTED BACK INTO HABITAT CREATES PRIDE, 
PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four years ago, the land was planted with crops. Part of Rancho Mission Viejo, 
Orange County's largest surviving cattle ranch, it featured furrowed rows of 
tomatoes, barley and carrots. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today, an entirely different vista greets visitors to this 61.4-acre patch of 
the 40,000-acre ranch. Where vegetables and grains once grew, a verdant forest 
of cool willows, sycamores and oaks now stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobcats, deer, mountain lions and owls now regularly inhabit the place. And 
covering the land almost to its horizon, the lush greenness connotes a natural 
abundance not seen here for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very proud of what we've done," says Gilbert Aguirre, executive vice 
president of the ranch, which is managed by the Santa Margarita Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the Canada Gobernadora Mitigation Area, the Santa Margarita 
company's effort to re-create some much-needed natural habitat, while turning a 
profit in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 In anticipation of next week's Earth Day, company officials unveiled the 
project Thursday by taking journalists on a tour by hay wagon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're putting this land back to the way it was," Aguirre said. "I think we've 
added a lot to the area." 
</P>
<P>
 In transforming former farmland into wetlands and riparian woodlands, the 
company has also satisfied some of its legal obligations, and improved its 
financial outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 The project was conceived in 1990 when, in exchange for permission to pursue 
specific developments in the town of Rancho Santa Margarita, various federal 
and state agencies exacted promises from the company to create 29 acres of 
mitigating natural habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 In researching the process, company officials say, they discovered that many 
other developers were under similar orders from the U. S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service as well as other government agencies. So, following its entrepreneurial 
instincts, the company decided to begin dedicating additional land and selling 
its services to other development agencies that likewise needed to re-create 
natural habitat.  
</P>
<P>
 To date, according to Richard Broming, the company's vice president for 
planning, three other development agencies have paid a total of about $3 
million to the Santa Margarita Co. for habitat that has cost the company about 
$1 million to provide. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, in addition to the 29 acres of nature-like habitat that the company was 
obligated to create as mitigation for housing development and last year's 
extensions of the Oso and Antonio parkways, an additional 28 acres was created 
for the Foothill/Eastern Transportation Corridor Agency to mitigate the 
environmental impact of portions of the Foothill tollway. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 4.4 acres have been evenly divided between Saddleback Valley Unified 
School District and Caltrans to mitigate for the building of a new school and 
construction on Ortega Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Broming said that more than 88 acres is still available for habitat 
development, some of which is already the object of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the 61.4 acres already developed, he said, the company has spent the 
last four years planting it with 10,000 willow trees, 1,000 sycamores and 300 
to 500 oaks. Other plant species now growing at the site include mule fat, 
mugwort, wild rye, deer grass, Mexican elderberry, California coffeeberry, 
lemonade berry and melic grass, as well as a grove of 60 oak and sycamore trees 
relocated from other areas rather than planted from cuttings. 
</P>
<P>
 The new bird life attracted to the area includes rafters, redwing blackbirds, 
hawks and turkey vultures. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a start," Broming said. "It's a philosophy and frame of mind. It's the 
beginning of something that may extend further." 
</P>
<P>
 To help the new plants get started, he said, the company made use of an 
extensive irrigation system, much of which was already in place. The result is 
a wide expanse of gently sloped green land that, in some areas, has already 
exceeded predictions of growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very excited," said Diane Gaynor, a company spokeswoman. "The growth is 
phenomenal." 
</P>
<P>
 While the area will never be open to the general public, she said, it will 
eventually be made available to biologists, people doing field research, 
various private groups and tours by area schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which makes company officials very happy at what they consider a job 
well done. "We want to give ourselves a pat on the back," Aguirre said Thursday 
before climbing aboard the truck-drawn hay wagon for the wilderness ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've taken care of this land for 110 years and done a good job, but this 
mitigation project has been an eye-opener for all of us," he added. "You can 
see how pretty it is; how many places in Orange County can you come and see 
that?" Restoration Residents The Santa Margarita Co. spent about $1 million to 
create and restore a 61-acre riparia woodlands and wetlands habitat. Some of 
the plant and wildlife that can be found there: Animals: Bobcats, deer, 
mountain lions. Birds: Owls, tri-colored blackbirds, rafters, hawks, turkey 
vultures. Trees: About 10,000 willows, 1,000 sycamores, 300-500 oaks. Plants: 
Mule fat, mugwort, Mexican elderberry, California coffeeberry, Lemonade berry.

UCI COST-CUTTING ARGUMENTS TRAVEL INTERNET FRONTIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As today's deadline approached for responses to two UC Irvine task force 
reports on cost-cutting recommendations, a barrage of electronic messages 
bombarded UCI cyberspace and ushered in a growing forum for campus debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees, students and others debated -- via electronic mail -- about which 
UCI programs should be sacrificed so the rest of the university can stay afloat 
through tough economic times. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time there has been a campuswide discussion like this," UCI 
spokeswoman Linda Granell said. "It couldn't have happened before. It would 
have been a heck of a phone tree." 
</P>
<P>
 Professors across the campus debated the importance of teaching vs. research 
and graduate students pleaded for the survival of threatened departments such 
as Education and Comparative Culture, all on messages posted on an electronic 
bulletin board accessible to almost anyone logged on to the Internet through a 
computer and a modem.  
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 messages had been posted on the conversational bulletin board by 
Thursday. By this morning, UCI spokesman Scott Nelson said, more than 300 
official responses to the task force reports -- some electronic, others on 
paper -- are expected to have reached the executive vice chancellor's office.  
</P>
<P>
 Karen Young, another spokeswoman for the university, said that the 300 letters 
had not been compiled and categorized, so there was no way of knowing how many 
were related to the proposed closure of UCI's education department, or how many 
opposed or favored that proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Academic Planning Council will examine all responses they receive by 
today's deadline, and will submit recommendations to Chancellor Laurel L. 
Wilkening by June 1, Nelson said. Some on the 20-member council, which is made 
up of professors, students and staff members, also have been skimming the 
public bulletin board, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone can read comments on the bulletin board, but people who subscribe to 
the board get postings on their computers soon after they are sent. Nelson said 
336 people are subscribed to the free service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where else but at a university would this type of discussion happen?" Nelson 
asked. "It's a multimedia public debate. People have talked over the bulletin 
board, at open meetings, town hall meetings . . . and at discussions either 
formal or informal." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The bulletin board has produced other benefits, Nelson said. Early messages 
that questioned UCI's mission, for example, have resulted in talks about 
redrafting the school's mission statement, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI's E-mail system is more extensive than those of other local universities 
and colleges. Administrators often send memos electronically, to save time and 
the expense of paper. 
</P>
<P>
 And through the "gopher," a computer program that helps users maneuver through 
bulletin boards and resources on the computer system, people can read 
information ranging from enrollment statistics to the latest releases of 
animated Japanese videos at the campus bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force bulletin board was created in February after the two 
cost-cutting reports were released, UCI officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The academic task force recommended that three departments be "disestablished" 
-- education, comparative culture and physical education. It suggested moving 
the teaching credential program to UC Extension or the California State 
University system, as well as merging several interdisciplinary programs and 
academic departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Contracting with private companies for some services that have been handled by 
university staff members was among the suggestions in the non-academic report. 
</P>
<P>
 Feedback to the task force bulletin board has been favorable, Granell said, so 
the computer forum will stay open after today's deadline for responses passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the messages are impassioned, others detached, academic and logical. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Balkanization of ethnic studies at UCI is a terrible step backward," 
wrote one Comparative Culture graduate student. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Evans, associate director of the UCI education department, has posted 
his own messages on the bulletin board. He said in an interview that the board 
is an excellent device for "getting the word out for how you feel," but he 
added that messages sometimes miss "that human touch." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of its value also depends on whether those who subscribe to it are really 
those who can affect decisions at the university, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of that, the bulletin board has advantages. Without it, Evans said, 
"we would've been limited to sending out written memos to whomever we felt it 
important to hear our side of things."

ANAHEIM'S MAYOR TARGET OF RECALL PLAN; ELECTION: POLICE UNION IS UNHAPPY WITH 
TOM DALY'S RECORD ON LAW ENFORCEMENT. HE LINKS EFFORT TO CONTRACT TALKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Anaheim Police Assn. has voted to start a recall effort against Mayor Tom 
Daly to show its displeasure with his leadership on law enforcement issues, 
union officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has shown a total lack of support for public safety in the city of 
Anaheim," union President Bruce Bottolfson said. "His focus has been on the 
(Los Angeles) Rams and construction projects in the city, not the citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 The union is expected to file a recall petition sometime within the next two 
weeks, Bottolfson said. The recall campaign comes at a time when Daly, who 
still has two years left on his council term, is gearing up for his mayoral 
reelection bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly said Thursday he has heard rumors about the union's intentions, but was 
not aware of the reasons behind the recall. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly said he thought the recall movement was probably "fallout" from the 
city's recently completed salary and benefit negotiations with rank-and-file 
police officers. The negotiations between the union and city were acrimonious 
and resulted in several police demonstrations, including a "blue-flu" job 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the police were hoping for more money, and I'm sympathetic to their 
desire," Daly said. "I will not be critical of the police, because I am on 
their side and I think that many of the officers know that." 
</P>
<P>
 Bottolfson, however, disputed Daly's assumption. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as we're concerned, the negotiations are over," he said. "We're doing 
this because we have yet to see any new innovation or commitment to public 
safety and the cops on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 The union's political-action committee last week voted 7-0 to pursue the 
recall. No other vote of the union's 335 members is expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Bottolfson said the union is not only upset with Daly's actions but is also 
dismayed by the leadership from the rest of the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know who the friendly faces are anymore," Bottolfson said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the union plans to play an important role in the upcoming City 
Council elections in November. The union's political-action committee dues have 
been increased from $1 to $10 a month per member. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should be building up a pretty nice war chest," he said, noting that the 
union currently has about $6,000 in its political-action account. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, another group called Neighborhoods Opposed to Street Vending 
in Anaheim had threatened to recall Daly because it, too, was frustrated over 
crime issues. Nothing, however, became of that recall effort. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, Daly defended his commitment to law enforcement, saying that in 
the five years since he has been on the council the police budget has grown 
from $37 million to $51 million. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Daly also said that he believes public safety issues are more 
important than trying to keep the Rams in Anaheim. He pointed to his action 
last November when he made a motion, which was unanimously approved by the rest 
of the council, to expand the Police Department by hiring 50 additional 
officers. The council, however, did not address how to raise the estimated $4 
million needed to hire the new officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bottolfson said Daly has made no effort to fulfill his hiring goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want him off the council," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to City Atty. Jack L. White, the union must notify Daly of the 
recall and its reason for pursuing it. Daly would then get an opportunity to 
respond to the union's charges and have his response included in the recall 
petition.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; BRASS RUBBING TO BE TAUGHT AT MISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brass rubbing, an art form from the Renaissance period, will be practiced at 
Mission San Juan Capistrano for the next two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting Monday, the London Brass Rubbing Centre will teach groups and 
individuals how to create brass rubbings, an art form that was popular in 
Europe during the 14th and 15 centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an art form that seems to appeal to all ages," said Richard Etches, the 
English director of the London Brass Rubbing Centre. "You don't have to be 
particularly artistic. It's simple and quick to produce a really lovely piece 
of artwork." 
</P>
<P>
 In Renaissance Europe, it was common for the gentry to commission an image of 
family members or scenes taken from brass plaques. Brass rubbing is the 
practice of rubbing special wax over paper, which is laid over casts of the 
plaques. The image on the plaque is re-created on paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rubbings are an accurate picture of the past," Etches said, "telling us 
about social customs, armor, trades, professions and family stories. They 
depict a 350-year period of England's history." 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit and art demonstration will continue at Mission San Juan through 
June 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission to the mission, instruction and materials for a small etching costs 
$7.50 for adults, $6.50 for senior citizens over 55 years old and $5.50 for 
children under 14. 
</P>
<P>
 The brass rubbing takes about 45 minutes. Larger etchings are available for a 
higher price that can take up to eight hours to complete, said mission 
officials.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; CITY WON'T CONTRACT FOR FIRE DISPATCHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rejecting a proposal to privately contract for some of its emergency services, 
the City Council this week approved the hiring of 18 Fire Department 
dispatchers to staff a communications center. 
</P>
<P>
 It will cost $1.2 million to pay for the positions. 
</P>
<P>
 As approved by the council on Tuesday, Anaheim will pay 45% of that total, 
while the other four cities in the North Net Fire Communications Center -- 
Buena Park, Fullerton, Garden Grove and Orange -- will share the rest of the 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Fire Chief Jeff Bowman said in a staff report that privatizing 
emergency dispatch services would provide scant savings and could hurt employee 
morale. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim, which will take over management of the North Net system this summer 
from the city of Orange, was considering contracting for dispatch services. 
Instead, it will hire 17 dispatchers now employed by the city of Orange, plus 
one new employee. 
</P>
<P>
 A city study found that a private contract for dispatch service would save the 
city $58,331 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the privatization proposal set off protests from members of the Orange 
County Employees Assn., who said the move would create a high turnover rate 
because dispatchers would lose a host of city benefits.MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; MOVIE STAR MIXES WITH HIS FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Until this week, few students at Martin R. Heninger Elementary School had ever 
met a movie star, and probably none had ever been licked on the face by one. 
</P>
<P>
 But that changed Tuesday morning, when about 750 excited students greeted one 
of their favorite stars of the silver screen, a 9-year-old golden retriever 
named Ben. 
</P>
<P>
 During his visit, the friendly dog, who played "Shadow" in the lead role of 
Disney's 1993 movie "Homeward Bound," performed tricks and acted out scenes 
from the film to the cheers and wild applause of students. 
</P>
<P>
 The assembly was part of a four-day series designed to pique students' 
interest in careers dealing with animals, said teacher Martha Gonzalez, who 
helped organize the event. During the assemblies, which conclude today, 
students have also heard animal trainers, veterinarians, farmers and police 
officers talk about their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Ben was the biggest hit with the students. Gonzalez said the children 
were so excited about Ben's visit that "all of them went home and bought the 
movie (video)." 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw a movie star dog, and he was fun," said Jaime Benavides, 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaime, who said he wants to be a veterinarian, added: "I like dogs. What I 
like about dogs is that they're nice to people." 
</P>
<P>
 During the visit, Ben's trainer, Nancy Mulica, guided him through several 
tricks such as barking on command, waving at the crowd, playing dead and 
growling. She also offered children tips on dealing with unfamiliar dogs and 
avoiding being bitten. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't run. Nasty dogs like the idea of chasing and knocking down" people, she 
said. She also advised children to clench their fists in the presence of an 
unfamiliar or threatening dog. When people strike dogs they usually do so with 
a slap, she said, and the animals can misconstrue the open hand of a stranger 
as a threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, children should ask a person's permission before petting or hugging an 
unfamiliar dog. They should show the dog that they are friendly by scratching 
its neck and underneath its chin with palms facing up. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Gonzalez, 8, took a few photos of Ben and said he was pleased to make a 
new friend: "He's nice. I like him." 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from the way Ben nuzzled Roger, the feeling was mutual. JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; LANDLORD GETS JAIL TERM FOR VIOLATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County Municipal Court judge has ordered an Anaheim landlord to 
serve a 30-day jail term for failing to adequately maintain his property. 
</P>
<P>
 Dat Ba Nguyen, 29, pleaded guilty last week to charges that he violated the 
city's public nuisance laws by failing to paint one of his buildings, leaving 
it open to dry rot and termite infestation, said Anaheim code enforcement 
supervisor Richard La Rochelle. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Martin Hairbedian in the Fullerton Municipal Court placed Nguyen on 
three years' probation and ordered him to immediately bring his six Anaheim 
properties up to city codes, according to Mark Logan, senior assistant city 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 In three separate inspections last year, code enforcement officers cited 
Nguyen for 30 violations for unsanitary conditions on his properties, including 
dry rot, inadequate roofing and failure to install smoke detectors. Nguyen's 
properties are at 801, 904 and 909 E. Balsam Ave.; 723 and 729 W. Bywood Ave., 
and 711 W. Hall Ave., Logan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen's jail term begins May 20. His lawyer could not be reached for comment.

 The state Integrated Waste Management Board recently designated Anaheim Canyon 
Business Center as a recycling market development zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The designation entitles businesses within the 2,400-acre area to low-interest 
loans and other state assistance. The businesses manufacture products from 
recycled materials such as glass, plastic and paper. 
</P>
<P>
 The business center contains the largest material-recovery facility by volume

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; MISSING MAN FOUND UNHURT OUTSIDE MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 57-year-old man missing for three days was found alive and well at a city 
shopping mall Thursday morning, according to Laguna Hills police. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Dan Stack of the department's missing-persons unit said police 
received a call Monday morning from Parkview Terrace, a Laguna Hills board and 
care home, about the disappearance of one of its residents, John Kay Sorensen. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloodhounds, a helicopter and about 20 officers searched the neighborhood for 
Sorensen, who suffered a brain injury several years ago and has the mental 
capability of a young child, Stack said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Laguna Hills patrol deputy found Sorensen about 10:30 a.m. Thursday, asleep 
in bushes in front of the JC Penney store at the Laguna Hills Mall, about a 
mile from the home. He recognized Sorensen from a missing-persons alert put out 
by the police, said Stack. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorensen, reportedly in good health, told the deputy he was planning to go 
north to visit family. He had a small bag filled with personal items, but how 
he fed himself is unknown, Stack said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Physically, he can do anything, but mentally . . . he couldn't tell you his 
name," Stack said. "I have no idea how he survived, but he must have eaten." 
</P>
<P>
 Stack said it was no surprise that Sorensen was found at the mall because he 
apparently "liked to be around people."AILEEN CHO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; SCHOOL DISTRICT BALANCES BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in five years, the Westminster School District has been 
able to staunch the flow of red ink and prepare a budget in which its income 
matches its expenses, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, spokeswoman Audrey Brown said that accumulated savings made from 
years of staff and class reductions, and by eliminating a school, made the 
financial turnaround for the 1994-95 fiscal year possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a huge relief. The (school board) is ecstatic and our budget director 
can't stop smiling," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, the district has been forced to spend about $1.7 million from its 
cash reserves to supplement its general fund. That fund covers expenses 
including salaries, benefits, materials and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, the district is expected to spend about $27 million from its 
general fund, about the same amount it will receive from the state, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the district's financial troubles resulted from years of reduced 
state funding combined with the recession. The current budgetary estimates show 
that the district probably will not need to dip into its reserve through 
1998.JON NALICK

 Parents of the Westminster School District may apply to send their children to 
any district school during the open enrollment period from Monday to April 29, 
a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications are available at all district schools. 
</P>
<P>
 To apply, parents must fill out the form and have it signed by principals at 
both the home school and the new school. Forms should be returned to the 
student's home school. Parents will be notified by May 13 whether the request 
has been approved, said district spokeswoman Audrey Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an opportunity that many of our parents still don't know about or 
understand," said Assistant Supt. Barbara Fileto. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the program "gives great flexibility to parents who, for example, may 
need to find a school near their day care provider."JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; LATINO GROUPS WANT BAN ON RACIST MAILERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking to prevent racist political hit pieces from appearing in the coming 
election, the leaders of two Latino groups said Thursday that they are asking 
the U.S. Postal Service to develop a policy that keeps such materials from 
being sent through the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter dated Wednesday to U.S. Postmaster Marvin T. Runyon, the 
presidents of the local chapter of the League of United Latin American Citizens 
and Los Amigos of Orange County seek a policy that would "stop the escalation 
of hate mailers." 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that hate mailers and voter intimidation do not fall under the 
protection of the First Amendment, Freedom of Speech," the groups wrote. "The 
intensity and hostility of past and recent printed hate literature can only add 
to the fuel and flames of ethnic and immigrant bashing occurring in Orange 
County, California and the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a proposed "Election Hate Crimes and Voter Intimidation Postal 
Policy," the groups suggest that violations carry fines of $5,000 per 200 
pieces of mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Arturo Montez, president of the LULAC chapter, said Thursday that he also 
asked the U.S. Department of Justice to assist in developing such a policy that 
would deter the spread of what he called "political pornography." 
</P>
<P>
 Montez said he has not yet received a response from the Postal Service or 
Justice Department. He said he hopes such requests will put political parties, 
candidates and consultants "on alert" against using racist literature in 
campaigns leading to the June 7 election. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a mailer "perpetuates a climate and atmosphere hostile to people of 
color," he said.ANNA CEKOLA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; FALLING ENROLLMENT TO MEAN FUND LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Huntington Beach Union High School District stands to lose up to $2.1 
million next year because enrollment continues to decline, board members were 
told this week. 
</P>
<P>
 But school officials said there is no need to panic. 
</P>
<P>
 The district governs all public high schools in Huntington Beach, Westminster 
and Fountain Valley. All those high schools have been declining in enrollment 
in recent years, and the overall district has dropped from 19,709 students in 
October, 1979, to 12,916 students in October, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials on Tuesday night gave the school board a gloomy forecast 
for continued loss of students through this year and the next. The officials 
said no increase in enrollment is predicted until 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials have previously attributed the decline in enrollment to the 
high cost of housing and have said there are fewer homes with school-age 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the loss of enrollment causes financial problems for school 
districts because state funding is based on a complex formula geared to daily 
attendance. Enrollment in the district dropped by 455 students between 
September and March. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. David Hagen told the school board that a state law protects districts 
with declining enrollment from loss of money during a one-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good news is that we are still able to claim our prior year (state 
funding base)," said Hagen. 
</P>
<P>
 That means the district suffers no immediate money loss for the decline of 
students in the current school year. But Hagen and acting Asst. Supt. Werner 
Deffner warned that the current-year loss will require painful budget cutting 
for the district in the 1994-95 school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Deffner said: "Our decline is much more severe than we anticipated. For this 
next year, the (continuing loss of students) will cost us about $2.1 million. 
Before we get out of the gate for the next (school) year, that's how much we 
will lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Deffner said that by the 1995-96 school year, the district should have a 
slight increase. "Hopefully, at that point things will get a little better for 
us, but we've still got a pretty hard road ahead of us before we get there," 
Deffner said. District Decrease Huntington Beach Union High School District has 
generally suffered declining enrollment since 1979. The only year-to-year 
increases came in 1984 and 1991. Annual October enrollment: '92: 12,916 Source:

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; POLICE COPTER USED IN FIREFIGHTING EXERCISE 
</P>

<P>
 A city police helicopter dropped thousands of gallons of ocean water onto a 
remote canyon Thursday as part of a training program to prepare public safety 
personnel to fight a major brush fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The exercise was prompted by last year's Laguna Beach firestorm, which came 
close to burning some of the rolling coastal hills of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were lucky for some winds that came out of nowhere," Sgt. Andy Gonis said 
of the Laguna fires. "We want to be prepared" for the next brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's training exercise involved both the fire and police departments. It 
was designed to give the helicopter crew experience in scooping up the ocean 
water and dropping it on land. 
</P>
<P>
 The water is collected in a "Bambi bucket," a plastic device that resembles an 
upside-down parachute. While the helicopter hovers over the ocean, the bucket 
is dropped into the water, where it can collect more than 100 gallons of 
liquid, Gonis said. The crew then flies the copter to the target point, and the 
water is released. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters and police Thursday ran the practice drop more than 20 times as 
part of the exercise. The drop point was Muddy Canyon, a secluded area to the 
east of Newport Coast Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Chief Timothy D. Riley said that portions of both Newport Coast Drive and 
Corona del Mar would benefit greatly from a water-dropping helicopter because 
fire engines have trouble gaining access to the remote areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an added resource because some areas lack roads where we can get in 
and apply the water," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department has two helicopters. They are used almost every night to 
make patrols and assist police on the ground, Gonis said. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; NEW SENIOR CENTER IS READIED FOR USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Lakeview Senior Center's gala grand opening was last week, but seniors 
will not be able to use the facility until Monday, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers are spending this week transporting furniture and equipment into the 
30,593-square-foot complex, which includes an adult day care center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are moving in at this point," said Judy Wright, a program specialist for 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's grand opening Saturday drew more than 4,000 people to the site, 
on the shores of a lake in Woodbridge. Television personality Art Linkletter 
and other entertainers capped a daylong celebration that included a dedication 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 The $7-million center has meeting rooms, an auditorium, a library, a dance 
floor and a large kitchen that will be used to prepare food for a 
meals-on-wheels program. 
</P>
<P>
 Exercise classes, health seminars and other activities will begin at the 
center Monday. Wright said that some arts and crafts classes will be offered 
within a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The library's opening will probably be delayed by a month. It will be stocked 
with general-interest books as well as many volumes dealing with retirement and 
careers for senior citizens, Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, officials would like to devote a section of the library to 
Chinese-language books, in recognition of the city's large Chinese elderly 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 A periodicals section is also planned, but Wright said the center does not 
currently have the funds to buy newspaper and magazine subscriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 The adult day care facility, which will offer medically supervised services to 
frail and ill seniors, is scheduled to open in July, said Clarence Nedom, 
chairman of the Irvine Senior Citizens Council. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: STANTON; COUNCIL LEGALIZES FIREWORKS SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council voted 3 to 2 this week to legalize fireworks in spite of 
protests from residents and the County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton becomes one of five cities in the county to allow state-approved 
fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Sal Sapien and Councilmen Harry Dotson and William C. Estrada voted to 
allow the sale and use of fireworks. They said they want nonprofit 
organizations to be able to sell fireworks to make money as the groups did 
before residents voted in 1988 for a ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Sapien said residents already buy fireworks in Garden Grove, which borders 
Stanton on three sides. "We get all the drawbacks of fireworks, but none of the 
benefits," Sapien said. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick McIntosh, assistant fire marshal, showed charts to the council to 
demonstrate that the number of fireworks-related fires has dropped by more than 
50% in the last 12 years. The number of fireworks-related injuries has fallen 
from 37 to three in the same time, he said. Those numbers include both legal 
and illegal fireworks, McIntosh said. He urged the council not to legalize 
fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County is set for a disaster at any time during those summer months," 
McIntosh warned. "There are safer ways to raise money than selling fireworks." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis C. Revell, a consultant for two fireworks manufacturers, said the 
number of accidents involving fireworks has decreased because of public safety 
education and not because of fireworks bans. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul McCarville spoke on behalf of the Knights of Columbus to appeal for the 
chance to sell fireworks. He said his group could make up to $3,000 from sales 
during early July, adding about 30% to the money raised each year through 
pancake breakfasts and donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight groups will be allowed this summer to sell state-approved fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sapien said the city must recover all of the estimated $11,060 to $13,860 
cost of hiring extra firefighters and licensing the fireworks booths. 
</P>
<P>
 Vendors will be charged up to $1,730 for a permit. Joan Thomas, director of 
the chamber of commerce, said the steep fees could eat up more than half of her 
group's anticipated profits if they sell fireworks and may make it not 
worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved fireworks sales for July 1-4. Fireworks will not be sold 
after 9 p.m. and may not be used after 10 p.m. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; MAN IS ARRESTED IN THEFTS AT PRESCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies have arrested a Tustin man on suspicion of stealing purses 
and wallets from cars of parents dropping off their children at South County 
preschools. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvaro Sosa Lizarraga, 25, was arrested Wednesday at a Tustin fast food 
restaurant.At the time, Lizarraga was with his 2-year-old son, who police said 
was used to help Lizarraga blend in to the preschool crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really bothered us that he was using his child," said Lt. Dan Martini. 
</P>
<P>
 Lizarraga was being held on $10,000 bond at the Orange County Jail on 
suspicion of theft. The child was placed in his mother's custody. 
</P>
<P>
 "Evidently, his wife had no idea this was going on," Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police contend that, since December, Lizarraga went to at least 10 preschools 
in Mission Viejo, Lake Forest and Laguna Hills. While parents, mostly mothers, 
dropped off their children, Lizarraga allegedly entered their unoccupied 
vehicles and took purses and wallets, removing cash before discarding them near 
the schools, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses' descriptions led deputies to Lizarraga and his son, Martini said.

FLASHLIGHT MOGUL TEARFULLY DENIES MARITAL RELATIONSHIP; COURTS: ANAHEIM HILLS 
MAN CONTENDS HE'S NOT LEGALLY OBLIGATED TO SHARE FORTUNE WITH LONGTIME 
COMPANION. WOMAN IS SEEKING HALF OF $300-MILLION EMPIRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Sobbing on the witness stand and cradling his head in his hands, flashlight 
mogul Anthony Maglica vowed at his palimony trial Thursday to care for Claire 
Maglica until the day she dies, but he insisted that he has no legal obligation 
to do so.  
</P>
<P>
 "I ask this jury to believe that I will provide for Claire as long as she 
lives, so she will never have to work. This I feel I will do, so God help me!" 
said Anthony Maglica, 64, of Anaheim Hills. "I feel so ashamed, like a child -- 
to cry -- but inside of me I hurt, because I know the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 The Maglicas were never married, but Claire, now 60, took Anthony's name 
anyway and they lived together for 23 years. She says she deserves half of Mag 
Instrument Inc., a $300-million flashlight empire they built together, because 
Anthony Maglica promised her from the time they met in 1971 that they would 
share everything. 
</P>
<P>
 He contends that Mag Instrument belongs entirely to him and that he never 
promised her anything during their lengthy relationship. Still smarting from a 
divorce settlement when he met Claire Maglica, Anthony Maglica said he was 
adamant about never losing control of his money, and in 1977, the couple signed 
an agreement to keep their assets separate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ladies and gentlemen, believe me. I work hard for my business and I never 
wanted to again split it with anyone," he testified. "I didn't pull any tricks 
on Claire or anybody else. . . . I have been fair to Claire. I treated her 
better than any husband would." 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts say that if Claire Maglica prevails, she could be awarded the 
largest palimony judgment ever. Since there is no common-law marriage in 
California, the case hinges on breach of contract, and whether jurors believe 
Claire's version of the 1971 oral agreement, or Anthony's version of the 1977 
written one -- which her attorneys claim is fraudulent. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, Anthony Maglica's attorney, Dennis M. Wasser, sought to have Orange 
County Superior Court Judge Robert J. Polis dismiss the case partly because the 
evidence presented by Claire's attorneys has revolved around common-law 
marriages, not breach of contract. Polis denied the motion. 
</P>
<P>
 While Anthony Maglica testified that he "had no intention of dumping Claire, 
and she knows that," her attorney John W. Keker suggested during his 
cross-examination that she believed that only because she trusted his promise 
to share all their assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Keker alleges that Claire Maglica's trust eroded when he told her in January, 
1992, that she was merely his "employee," not his wife or business partner. Up 
until that time, Keker contends that Anthony Maglica treated Claire like a wife 
and co-owner of the Ontario-based 600-employee Mag Instrument Inc., where she 
is still executive vice president. She also claims to have supervised 
advertising, marketing and packaging. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maglicas, Keker suggested, were the only ones at the company not 
participating in the employee profit-sharing plan, and Anthony Maglica set 
Claire's salary in what he described as a random fashion, reinforcing her 
belief that she was entitled to half of everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was paid like a wife, wasn't she?" Keker asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wasn't paid like a wife. She was paid like my best friend," Anthony 
Maglica answered, adding that she was "well compensated" and could have built a 
nest egg with her salary rather than spend it on extravagances. 
</P>
<P>
 As the plaintiff's case concluded, Anthony Maglica's attorneys put him on the 
stand briefly Thursday to talk about his life. Though born in New York City in 
1930, he said he soon returned with his Croatian mother to a tiny island in the 
Adriatic Sea that his family has called home for generations. 
</P>
<P>
 In great detail, Maglica recounted in a hoarse voice the hardships he 
encountered as he struggled to make something of his life. He said that he 
survived near-starvation and confrontations with German soldiers during World 
War II. He recalled slaving long hours for little pay as a machinist when he 
returned to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked hard. It didn't come by itself," Anthony Maglica testified.

AGENCY BACKS OFF ON TRASH HAULER FEE HIKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN RAY BALLOU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's Waste Management Commission on Thursday reversed a recent 
recommendation for increasing the dumping fee for county trash haulers and 
appointed a committee to look into ways of keeping the fee at current levels. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 12-2 vote, the agency that manages county landfills rescinded last 
month's recommendation that the Board of Supervisors increase haulers' gate 
fees from $22.75 to $27.66 per ton of trash brought to the landfill, beginning 
July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase would have boosted all county residents' trash collection fees 
one dollar per month. Residents typically pay between $9 and $15 monthly for 
trash pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report prepared shortly after last month's 8-7 vote in favor of raising 
the dumping fees, commissioners who voted against the hike listed four 
"high-expenditure" programs in which the commission could achieve savings, 
rather than pass costs on to residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The report was enough to sway the opinions of many who had previously voted 
for the fee hike, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission member Larry Nelson blasted County Waste Management Director Murry 
Cable -- who had initially voted for the fee hike -- for changing his stance on 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I voted for the increase because you supported it," Nelson told Cable. "My 
confidence in the staff is greatly shaken. I still think an increase is in 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, we're basically saying that everything we believed in back then was 
wrong," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cable said the committee's initial decision was made without scrutinizing 
the alternatives to raising fees thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought that we had a time limitation to make our decision, so some things 
were not looked into as closely as they should have been," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The costs of meeting increasingly stringent environmental regulations, the 
success of recycling efforts and a sluggish economy have combined to cut into 
the agency's cash reserves and the volume of waste going into landfills, 
officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
 An independent report by Hilton, Farnkopf & Hobson, a Newport Beach consulting 
company, stated that to keep pace, the agency must charge more to handle the 
refuse coming into its landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission on Thursday selected a five-member committee that will look 
into ways to reduce operating and capital costs, targeting the four 
high-expenditure programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those programs are federally mandated regulatory requirements, which 
will make it difficult for the commission to cut back those programs, officials 
said.

WETLAND PROJECT REPORT HEAVILY CRITICIZED; ENVIRONMENT: FIVE AGENCIES SAY 
COUNTY'S EVALUATION OF KOLL HOME-BUILDING PLANS IS INSUFFICIENT REGARDING BOLSA 
CHICA RESTORATION, AND SHOULD BE DONE OVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A host of governmental agencies have charged that an environmental impact 
report done by the county on a proposal to build 4,800 homes and restore Bolsa 
Chica wetlands is so incomplete that it should be redone. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The criticism was leveled in February by five environmental agencies, 
including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which claimed in a letter to 
Orange County Planning Director Tom Mathews that the report was "inadequate as 
a basis for local and state decision-making." 
</P>
<P>
 Also involved are the state Department of Fish and Game, National Marine 
Fisheries Service, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the state Coastal 
Commission staff. The state and federal fish and game agencies asked that the 
report be redone. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Environmental Management Agency prepared the impact report 
on a development proposed by Koll Real Estate Group, which has proposed 
spending $48 million to restore 1,100 acres of wetlands in exchange for the 
right to build homes. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, the county apparently failed to disclose important biological 
survey information, especially about birds that nest on the property, such as 
the western snowy plover. 
</P>
<P>
 "They claim the biological information exists but they don't tell you what it 
is," said Jack Fancher, a federal fish and wildlife supervisory biologist based 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Fancher said that benefits the report claims would result from restoring the 
wetlands are insufficient. He said the nesting area of the snowy plover, which 
the federal government has listed as threatened with extinction, might be wiped 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 The exclusion of such significant data from the report, Fancher said, "leaves 
a whole series of doubts that would make it irresponsible to make a decision 
based on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews was out of the office Thursday and unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Coastal Commission staff, the Koll proposal does not comply 
with the Coastal Act and does not provide information needed to determine the 
net benefit of the proposed wetland restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 In another letter to the county in February, the National Marine Fisheries 
Service said the proposed development "is an inappropriate use of this scarce 
resource." In addition, agency officials said it is not clear what acreage is 
being counted as restored wetlands in the county's environmental report. 
</P>
<P>
 Koll's estimated cost of creating the new wetlands system was not addressed in 
the impact report and "it is not clear how the estimate was determined," the 
fisheries agency wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the EPA told the county planning director that there are "several 
less environmentally damaging alternatives than the proposed project analyzed 
in the EIR . . . which would involve no residential development in the 
lowlands." EPA officials say the agency will provide detailed information in 
its own environmental impact statement for the Bolsa Chica proposal.

ESTRANGED COUPLE CRITICALLY HURT IN SANTA ANA DOMESTIC DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A domestic dispute between an estranged couple in the 800 block of South 
Cypress Avenue left both parties hospitalized with serious injuries Thursday, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight began when Vertaldo Victerio Cestelan, 48, arrived at the home of 
Josefina Lucero Madin, said Sgt. Dick Faust. In the ensuing melee, Cestelan and 
Lucero attacked each other with knives and two bedposts, Faust said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Cestelan and Lucero were critically injured. Police found Lucero in a 
nearby carport and Cestelan in the apartment. Cestelan was taken to Western 
Medical Center-Santa Ana; Lucero to UCI Medical Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither person has been arrested or charged, Faust said. The case is under 
investigation.

 First on the agenda is a fair Saturday at UC Irvine featuring displays by 30 
environmental organizations, including the Bolsa Chica Foundation, California 
Native Plant Society, Friends of Newport Bay, Nature Conservancy, Surfrider 
Foundation and the Orange County Bird of Prey Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our hope is to generate real strong public interest in public issues," said 
Randy Lewis, UCI's director of student activities. "I think this is part of the 
university's mission." 
</P>
<P>
 Earth Day, an annual event scheduled this year on April 22, grew out of a 1970 
speech by U.S. Sen. Gaylord Nelson proposing a series of environmental 
teach-ins on the nation's college campuses. After an auspicious beginning, the 
event languished for two decades until 1990 when promoters celebrated its 20th 
anniversary amid great hoopla. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's observance, said Dawn Matthews, spokeswoman for Earth Day USA 
based in New Hampshire, is being planned as a "springboard" for next year's 
25th anniversary, which is expected to involve more than 200 million people 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was really feeling the urgency to pull something together," Matthews 
said of this year's event, themed The Time Has Come. "The key words for 
programs we want people to develop and launch are education, action and working 
toward sustainability." 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, environmentalists are planning a series of events beginning with the 
UCI fair. The event, to be held in conjunction with the annual Celebrate UCI 
day, is expected to draw 18,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is not being pegged as an official Earth Day observance, a 
ribbon-cutting is set for Saturday by the Bolsa Chica Conservancy to mark the 
imminent opening of its long-awaited interpretive center at the Bolsa Chica 
wetlands. The day will also celebrate the annual return of the California least 
tern, an endangered species, to the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, supporters of the Upper Newport Bay Ecological Reserve will offer 
music, entertainment, nature tours, environmental exhibits, canoe rides and 
contests at Shellmaker Island on Back Bay Drive a quarter-mile north of Newport 
Dunes. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Sunday, Anaheim will have its fourth "Let's Make a Difference" 
Environmental Faire for adults and children from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Peralta 
Canyon Park, 115 N. Pinney Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The event will feature more than 40 environmental information booths, an 
island art area for children, music and entertainment by a drum band and 
cartoon characters. The event is free. Information: (714) 254-5191. 
</P>
<P>
 Earth Day observances resume Tuesday at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa. 
Students plan a series of displays and speeches, many of them centered on the 
theme of legalizing marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 "We consider this a major environmental issue," said Lee Wilson, one of the 
event's organizers. Hemp, the plant that produces marijuana, has many 
environmental uses including fuel, fiber, food and medicine, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, students at Golden West College in Huntington Beach will weigh 
in with entertainment, information booths and fund-raising food sales from 10 
a.m. to 2 p.m. Entertainers will include Native American musicians and 
storytellers. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday and Thursday, Cal State Fullerton will host six bands and display 
25 exhibits focusing on such issues as recycling and conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't done anything this big before," said Karena Gibbs, one of the 
student organizers. "We just thought our campus needed to wake up." 
</P>
<P>
 Wild hawks will be released during one of the county's last Earth Day 
observances, on April 23. Members of Earth Save Orange County, a local group 
that promotes vegetarianism, will hike to the Holy Jim Falls area of South 
Orange County to release the birds, which had been injured and have now been 
rehabilitated. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're doing," said chairwoman Sandy LaBedz, "is reconnecting people with 
nature. We want them to have a reverence for life and the interconnectedness of 
everything on the planet."

ANAHEIM TO OPEN O.C.'S 1ST TELECOMMUTING WORK CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The county's first telecommuting work center is scheduled to open here by the 
end of May, city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The new facility would give county residents with lengthy commutes the option 
of working from the center instead of driving to their places of employment. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be equipped with 20 workstations and will feature facsimile machines, 
a copy center, computer labs, a conference room and two-way video telephones. 
It was planned by the city with public grants and there will be a monthly 
charge to users. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tele-center will allow people to commute via the electronic highway 
instead of a congested freeway," said Kathleen Reavis of the city's Public 
Works Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved the plans for the Downtown Anaheim Telecenter 
Agreement on Tuesday night. The facility will be in the Kraemer Building, 201 
Center St. 
</P>
<P>
 The city received two grants totaling $212,000 from UC Davis and the South 
Coast Air Quality Management District to develop the project. 
</P>
<P>
 URO Investments, an Irvine property management company, will operate the 
center. The city, the Redevelopment Agency and the Irvine firm will jointly 
market the center.

NEWSWIRE: ORR TELLS IOWA STATE HE'S RETIRING AT 66 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Johnny Orr, basketball coach at Iowa State for 14 years, announced Thursday 
that he would not return for a 15th season. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting back tears, Orr, 66, said at Ames, Iowa, that he will remain at Iowa 
State as associate athletic director to fulfill the last year of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 218-200 at Iowa State -- 14-13 last season -- and 209-113 in 12 seasons 
at Michigan before that. A 39-33 record in three seasons at Massachusetts gives 
him an overall coaching record of 466-346. 
</P>
<P>
 Orr's best record at Michigan was 26-4 in 1976-77, when the Wolverines won the 
Big Ten championship and were ranked No. 1 nationally. Miscellany  
</P>
<P>
 The Office for Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Education has accused 
Fresno State of failing to provide women with athletic opportunities comparable 
to those offered men. 
</P>
<P>
 The university was cited for 11 violations, most dealing with the lack of 
adequate facilities and sports for women athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 A summary of the federal report said women made up 54.3% of Fresno State's 
full-time undergraduates in 1990-91, the year the study was made, but only 
27.3% of the athletes.

SOFTBALL ROUNDUP; VILLA PARK, MCARTHUR BEAT FOOTHILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Villa Park softball Coach Dave Shelton is happy his Spartans had 16 games to 
prepare for the Century League race. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our girls finally learned how to bunt properly and because of it we are 2-0 
in league," Shelton said Thursday after two sacrifice bunts set up the only run 
of the game against Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
 Heather Culver singled home Julie Riley with one out in the seventh inning to 
give Villa Park a 1-0 victory. The Spartans are 11-7, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley opened the bottom of the seventh with a single down the left-field line. 
Tammy Kincaid was safe when her bunt was mishandled. Silvia Salgado's bunt 
traveled less than a foot, but it was enough to move both runners over. Culver 
then singled to left center. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandee McArthur (6-3) pitched a two-hitter but had to survive a shaky first 
inning. Foothill (13-6, 1-1) loaded the bases when Laureen Bayer was safe on a 
passed ball after a strikeout and Gieron and Amie Barnes walked. McArthur 
struck out the next batter -- her third strikeout of the inning -- to end the 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
 McArthur helped herself by catching a line drive and turning it into a double 
play in the second inning. Only one Foothill runner reached base -- on a walk 
-- in the final five innings. MIKE WOJCIECHOWSKI

TENNIS ROUNDUP; EL TORO GETS VICTORY AS SAN CLEMENTE'S SKID CONTINUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What began as a promising week for San Clemente's fifth-ranked tennis team has 
turned disastrous. The Tritons entered the week at 8-1 and tied for first place 
in the South Coast League at 2-0. But Thursday's 13 1/3-7 2/3 loss to El Toro 
was San Clemente's second in a row, and the forecast for next week isn't much 
brighter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tritons (8-3, 2-2) will play second-ranked Dana Hills and fourth-ranked 
Corona del Mar, and will be without Jeff Shoemaker, their second-best doubles 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoemaker gutted it out Tuesday in a loss to Capistrano Valley and Thursday 
played at about 50% efficiency. Shoemaker and his partner, Jason Gavilan, lost 
4-6, 7-5, 6-0, Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was using a springboard to do some stuff shots and, after hanging on the 
rim, he fell flat on his back and bruised his pelvis," San Clemente Coach Bob 
Gustafson said. "It was pretty great that he even came out here today. I told 
him before the match that if he didn't play, we didn't have a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tritons might have had a better chance with a healthy Shoemaker, but they 
might have lost to a rapidly improving El Toro team anyway. El Toro (9-3, 3-1) 
took eight of nine singles sets and won four of nine doubles sets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers' most impressive and significant doubles victory came early, when 
junior Andy Chen and freshman Travis Blank handed Daniel Roditi and Eli Engle 
their first loss of the season, 7-5. Roditi and Engle had won their first 18 
sets together. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of pressure on our kids because we knew how good they were," 
El Toro Coach Bob Bachelor said. Roditi and Shoemaker figure to be one of the 
top-seeded teams at the Ojai tournament next Thursday, providing Shoemaker's 
pelvis heals in time. 
</P>
<P>
 In another South Coast League match: 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo 13, Mater Dei 8 -- Mission Viejo (4-7, 2-2) used its doubles 
play to get the victory. Christian Fernandez and Fernando Machuca won, 6-3, 
6-0, 6-1. Cuong Tran and Josh Fair won, 6-0, 6-1, 6-1, and Dave Beydler and 
Tofer Patton won, 6-0, 7-5, 6-1. Mater Dei is 4-6, 0-4. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Century League: 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill 13, Canyon 8 -- Jack Huang swept his singles matches, 6-3, 6-2, 6-1, 
to lead No. 6-ranked Foothill over No. 8-ranked Canyon. Huang has lost only two 
sets all season. The No. 3 doubles team of Thomas Lin and Lance Stern came from 
behind in two sets to win two of three, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4, for Foothill (14-1, 
5-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park 14 1/3, Santa Ana Valley 6 2/3 -- Ryan Hollis won, 6-0, 6-0, 6-0, 
Chad Smith won, 6-0, 6-0, 6-1, and Brandon Louie won, 6-1, 6-2, 6-2, to lead 
Villa Park (10-2, 3-1). 
</P>
<P>
 In the Garden Grove League: 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove 21, Los Amigos 0 -- In singles, Binh Nguyen swept his sets, 
losing no games, 6-0, 6-0, 6-0, for Garden Grove (11-2, 5-0). In doubles, Nima 
Vazin and Jimmy Nguyen also won all their games, 6-0, 6-0, 6-0. The Argonauts 
are ranked 10th in the Division II Southern Section poll. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Pacific Coast League: 
</P>
<P>
 Estancia 21, Century 0 -- Rob Horansky led an Estancia sweep by winning his 
singles sets, 6-0, 6-0, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Sunset League: 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View 13 1/3, Fountain Valley 7 2/3 -- Jakub Pietrowski swept No. 1 
singles, 6-0, 6-0, 6-0, and Paul Choi swept No. 2 singles, 6-0, 6-0, 6-1, to 
lead host Ocean View (10-3, 8-2).

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK: DISBRO FINDS HIS NICHE AT CHAPMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Until he discovered Chapman University last fall, Donny Disbro's college 
baseball career was a wash. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't supposed to turn out that way. Disbro batted .367 as a junior at 
Mission Viejo in 1989 and accepted an 80% scholarship to Division I Santa Clara 
before his senior season, passing up offers from Oklahoma, Pacific and Cal 
State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 But things didn't work out at Santa Clara for Disbro, a first baseman. He 
played sparingly as a freshman -- "I had no numbers I want to share with 
anyone," he said -- and was a redshirt as a sophomore when it became apparent 
he wouldn't play much that season either. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a frustrating couple of years. Friends asked him, "Why worry? Who cares 
if you're not playing as long as your tuition is paid?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Disbro said he couldn't be satisfied sitting. His father, Russ, who pitched 
for Oklahoma in 1966-68 and ranks fourth on the Sooner all-time complete-game 
list with 22, had set a standard he wanted to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 So he gave up his scholarship and transferred to Rancho Santiago. But the 1993 
Dons, who would win the State championship, already had a starting first 
baseman, so Disbro only worked out with the team in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago Coach Don Sneddon pointed him toward Chapman, a program making 
a transition from Division I to Division III. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided after all my transitions, I just wanted to find a place to play," 
Disbro said. "It didn't matter if it was Division I, II or III. I just wanted 
to show people I could play." 
</P>
<P>
 After shedding 30 pounds to get down to 230, Disbro, who is 6 feet 3, is 
proving himself worthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman Coach Rex Peters said Disbro has been the most consistent Panther 
batter. Batting fourth, he is leading the team in batting average (.293), runs 
batted in (27) and total bases (55). The Panthers (10-23-1) play host to 
Westmont today at Hart Park, then finish the season Tuesday at home against UC 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The season finale will give Chapman a chance for redemption: the Tritons, 
ranked third in Division III, swept a three-game series from the Panthers last 
week. 
</P>

 Southern California College softball pitchers Beth Howard and Shannon Saylor 
continue to shut down opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Saylor extended her scoreless-inning streak to 45 with two shutout 
victories over Biola. Howard, who earlier in the season had a 55-inning 
scoreless streak, allowed only one run in each of two victories over Biola and 
shut out Point Loma Nazarene, 11-0, in a game shortened to six innings by the 
mercy rule Saturday. Saylor's scoreless streak ended in the first game against 
Point Loma. She took a 5-3 loss, but didn't allow an earned run. 
</P>
<P>
 Saylor, a junior from Diamond Bar, was named the NAIA District 3 pitcher of 
the week. Howard, a senior from Cypress High, was named the Golden State 
Athletic Conference pitcher of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering the week, Howard and Saylor led the district in earned-run average. 
Howard's was 0.63 and Saylor's 0.72. 
</P>
<P>
 SCC's Angie Vega, a sophomore center fielder from Savanna High, was named the 
conference player of the week after going four for five with a triple, two RBIs 
and two runs in the doubleheader against Point Loma.

HE'S FINALLY A HIT; STATON BATTLES ILLNESS, INJURY TO REACH THE PADRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During his state-of-the-Padres address before spring training, Manager Jim 
Riggleman said Dave Staton would have to hit to keep his job as the starter at 
first base. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first at-bat of the spring, Staton crushed a towering home run that 
gave everyone plenty of time to admire it and Riggleman cause to reflect on his 
good decision to give the rookie a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 You see, Staton is not very fast. OK, he's slow. And he's probably not going 
to win any Gold Gloves. OK, he hasn't got a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 But he can hit baseballs a long, long way. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask the folks in Las Vegas. Last season, Staton hit a shot off the top of 
the scoreboard there that was so prodigious, the front office hired a survey 
team to figure how far the ball would have traveled if the scoreboard hadn't 
been in the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get lucky once in a while," Staton said, smiling. "You catch the ball just 
right, and it goes out of the ballpark, and people like to watch that, but 
that's just an extra. I don't go up there trying to do it. Sometimes it just 
happens. 
</P>
<P>
 "That one in Vegas was the best ball I ever hit. Plus, the ball travels there 
better than most places. They estimated it would have gone 580 feet." 
</P>
<P>
 Staton, who regularly made baseballs disappear when he played at Cal State 
Fullerton, Orange Coast College and Tustin High, is finally getting an 
opportunity in the big leagues after major injuries slowed his progress through 
the minors. 
</P>
<P>
 He cracked a vertebra in his back while swinging at a pitch near the end of 
the 1991 season at Las Vegas. The injury did not require surgery but required a 
lengthy and ongoing rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, while throwing a ball from the outfield in 1992, he almost tore his 
rotator cuff in half. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shoulder injury cost me a whole year," he said. "To give you an idea of 
how bad it was, I had twice as much surgery as Orel Hershiser. You know how 
long and severe his was, well, mine was twice that bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was a pitcher, my career would be over." 
</P>
<P>
 As it was, his wife, Liz, fed, bathed and dressed him for two months after the 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Staton learned long ago how to be a patient patient. During his sophomore year 
at Tustin, he was diagnosed with systemic lupus, a disease that affects joints, 
muscles and organs and can cause abnormalities in the immune and nervous 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Blood clots formed in his legs, and he was hospitalized four times for periods 
up to three months. Eventually, his spleen had to be removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors told him to give up baseball. Instead, Staton gave up his rights to 
sue the school district and signed a medical release form so he could play for 
the Tillers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing baseball is all I ever wanted to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So he wasn't about to let a little -- or even huge -- rip of his shoulder 
muscles stop him from making it to the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Staton's arm is not yet up to 100% strength, but with a limited throwing 
regimen during the spring, he believes he will be able to make it through the 
season at first base. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only question is how my shoulder reacts to playing every day, to throwing 
day in and day out for week after week," he said. "I watch it really closely. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sometimes stiffens up a little bit, but it doesn't really bother me. 
There's no real pain factor. And swinging the bat has always been fine ever 
since I first picked up a bat after surgery." 
</P>
<P>
 That big swing -- and San Diego ownership's salary-cutting fire sale last year 
-- have put Staton in position to play his way out of a starting job after only 
42 major league at-bats before this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "From one standpoint, the situation with this organization did work in my 
favor," Staton said. "Still, it's hard for me to look at it like that because 
I've been hit with two severe injuries, so it's hard to say things have gone in 
my favor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean I'm confident enough in my ability that I think I should have been 
playing at this level a year and a half ago. In any case, I'm not going to 
dwell on my past problems or how my opportunity finally presented itself. There 
are a lot of ifs, ands and buts in this crazy game, and if you sit and worry 
about when you will get your shot or why you haven't gotten a shot, your shot 
may never come. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody here has had to go through some roadblocks. Some guys are fortunate 
enough to have to go through fewer. To this point, I haven't been the guy with 
the fewer, but all I can do is make the most of this chance now. And I feel 
good about my chances." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of that optimism stems from his brief stint with the Padres last season. 
Staton was called up on Sept. 6, and his first big league hit was a pinch-hit 
homer off the Dodgers' Kevin Gross. The ball landed in the second deck at San 
Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Staton hit four more homers in the final days of the 1993 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got an awful lot of pop in his bat," pitcher Andy Benes said, "and now 
that he's healthy, he can be a real impact hitter for us. It's just a matter of 
staying in a good frame of mind and not getting too down if things don't start 
off too well." 
</P>
<P>
 Staton is struggling with a .160 average and Benes hopes he hasn't started 
pressing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope he knows that he'll be out there," Benes said, "so it's not a matter 
of, 'I have to hit right now.' I hope that helps him relax and just go out 
there and have fun." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Staton thought the fun had ended after his senior year at Tustin when USC 
Coach Mike Gillespie informed him that he couldn't help the Trojan program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a great year as a senior in high school (hitting .525) and I really 
wanted to go to USC," Staton said. "I was really disappointed. I've talked to 
him since, and I think he's changed his opinion about that, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope he's just one of the coaches who are kicking themselves now for not 
giving me a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Orange Coast College Coach Mike Mayne, now a scout with the Seattle 
Mariners, showed "tremendous interest," Staton says, but "no one else cared." 
</P>
<P>
 So Staton went to OCC and two years later became a Titan because Fullerton was 
the only Division I school to offer a scholarship. He was named a second-team 
All-American designated hitter after his only season at Fullerton in 1989, 
hitting .361 with 18 home runs and 72 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I had a spectacular year there, and I have happy memories, but it 
wasn't my first choice," he said. "I just didn't have any other options." 
</P>
<P>
 It was for the same reason that Staton ended up at OCC, but that experience, 
he says, is one of the major reasons he's in the majors today. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was far and away the best decision I ever made and the biggest boost to 
my career," Staton said. "Mike Mayne taught me exactly what I needed to set me 
on course. 
</P>
<P>
 "He taught me what I needed to know about the game, and he showed me how to 
polish my skills. Most important, he re-motivated me in that I developed an 
understanding of what the game is all about and what can be accomplished in 
this game." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the Padres haven't accomplished much. A 1-9 record isn't the kind 
confidence-building beginning they hoped would jump-start this young team and 
put an end to discussions of the organization's downfall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have to face the full brunt of the whole season last year, just the 
last month," Staton said, "but this year I don't sense any of the negativity 
that I read and heard so much about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the guys are ready to put that behind them. You never know what's 
going to happen with the new playoff format. Heck, if you can stay healthy and 
put consistent players on the field, in a four-team division, who knows? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really difficult to keep a team healthy over the course of 162 games. 
God knows I haven't been able to do it. Hopefully, this will be my first year, 
and everyone in this clubhouse will do it too."

EVERY DAY IS LADIES' DAY; EX-CSUN CATCHER CRESS HOOKS ON WITH WOMEN'S 
PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Missy Cress became a professional baseball player last week, but her story is 
nothing like the movie "A League of Their Own." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There'll be no charm school for the former Cal State Northridge softball 
catcher. She won't be wearing a dress either. And her manager isn't a washed-up 
curmudgeon with a drinking problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the players in the popular 1992 film, when Cress takes the field for 
the first time for the Colorado Silver Bullets next month, the all-female team 
sponsored by a beer company will be playing it straight. And against men. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is no April Fools' thing and it's not a beauty contest," Manager Phil 
Niekro said. "These are strictly baseball players. Once the program gets going, 
women all over the country will be playing baseball and they'll get away from 
that softball." 
</P>
<P>
 Niekro, a knuckleball pitcher who won 318 games over 24 major league seasons, 
has assembled a big-league cast to coach the women. Former big leaguers Joe 
Niekro (Phil's brother), Paul Blair and Joe Pignatano serve as coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The 24 Silver Bullets will play a 50-game, cross-country exhibition season 
that starts May 8 against the North League All-Stars in North Carolina and 
includes stops at Candlestick Park in San Francisco and Mile High Stadium in 
Denver. Lining up against the women will be men's minor league (Class A and 
Rookie league teams) and semipro clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Each player will earn traveling expenses and $20,000. The Bullets will earn 
every penny if their initial reception is any indication. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the Bullets played their first practice game, squaring off 
against the Austrian national team. The Bullets won, 7-6, which didn't make the 
Austrian men very happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the final out, Cress said, several Austrians referred to the 
Bullets by using a vulgar term. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure some people will feel like women don't belong out here," Cress said. 
"We really don't know what to expect so right now I'm just thinking about what 
a great opportunity it is. 
</P>
<P>
 "People come up to us and say, 'Gosh, you guys are making history.' I would 
like to have had female players to look up to when I was growing up. It's 
great." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, but not everyone will embrace the Bullets with open arms. A 
well-known columnist for a top sports publication already took a shot at the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even people who love the opportunities for expression that sports gives women 
must wonder why a women's professional baseball team would want to play 50 
games against minor league and semipro men's teams," Dave Kindred wrote in The 
Sporting News. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe if the guys are called out in one strike and the women get seven 
strikes. . . . maybe if the women run 45-foot base paths and pitch from 35 
feet. . . . maybe if a woman's foul tip is counted as a home run. . . . maybe 
if the women get nine outs an inning and the men get one. . . . maybe then the 
men will win by scores of 15-3 instead of 32-0 every night." 
</P>
<P>
 The comments are unfair and premature, Niekro said. He refuses to predict how 
many games the Bullets will win, but believes the team will be competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really just don't know because some days they look fine and some days they 
look like they're still making adjustments," Niekro said. "But statements like 
that really bother me a lot because we should at least have the opportunity. 
Maybe after he sees us play some games he will change his mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Niekro has treated his players as though they were big leaguers. In one scene 
from "A League of Their Own," which chronicles one season in a women's pro 
baseball league during World War II, Tom Hanks, the reluctant and drunken 
manager, complained: "I don't have ballplayers, I have girls." 
</P>
<P>
 The coaching staff has been nothing but supportive, Cress said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was first class and the coaches always treated us like 
professionals," she said. "It really felt like I was a major leaguer." 
</P>
<P>
 Cress was one of 1,300 women invited to try out for the team and was among 49 
finalists flown to Orlando, Fla., last month to compete for a spot on the final 
roster. The site of the tryout was Tinker Field, former spring training base of 
the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I kept thinking was, 'Wow, the field is so big!' " Cress said. "It's 
like, I'm going to play here ?" 
</P>
<P>
 That from an athlete who last year played in the College Softball World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is so much more challenging," Cress said. "Even when you hit the ball, 
you have to run 90 feet instead of 60 and you have to throw so much farther." 
</P>
<P>
 Cress, who also played softball at Royal High and Moorpark College, made the 
Bullets' final cut at catcher last week. 
</P>
<P>
 She was a starter as a senior at Northridge last season and had a .270 batting 
average with 17 runs batted in and three home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first day I saw her behind the plate, she was above all the other 
catchers we saw," Niekro said. "She's very talented. Her biggest problem has 
been to throw from the plate all the way to second base." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullets train seven days a week, three hours a day in their home base in 
Winter Haven, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so exciting but it's so hard," Cress said. "I never thought I would play 
baseball. A lot of this is so new to me. I am walking away from this with so 
much more respect for baseball players." 
</P>
<P>
 The transition from softball to baseball hasn't been easy, Cress said. Wooden 
bats are heavier than the aluminum ones used in softball. Baseball dimensions 
are tougher to navigate, and the ball is so much smaller and travels faster. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the etiquette issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "In baseball you don't run from the batting circle like we do in softball," 
Cress said. "Our coach said to walk coolly. You gotta be cool, I guess. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, and you don't stand up and cheer in the dugout like we do in softball. 
The first day Phil said, 'I've never seen an entire team stand up in the dugout 
and scream so much.' In baseball you just sit there quietly." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting the women to adjust wasn't easy, according to Niekro. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took us quite while to get the softball flavor out of their mind," he 
said. "We still are to a certain extent. But they're like sponges, they learn 
so quickly. They're very coachable. The public has to be patient because this 
is the first time there's been women versus men." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the Bullets are scrutinized all season and get whipped by the 
opposition, Cress believes the experience will be positive. The monthlong 
tryout alone, she said, was exciting if for no other reason than the media 
hoopla. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullets were filmed eating dinner, practicing and just hanging out. 
They've been on television and more than 50 publications have written about 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Geena Davis, star of "A League of Their Own," sent the Bullets a letter 
wishing them good luck, and some of the Bullets even have their own baseball 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't been Michael Jordan-esque, but we've had a steady stream of media," 
said Kathleen Christy, the organization's director of media relations. "We get 
about 100 calls a week and the ladies have done a lot of interviews." 
</P>
<P>
 Those have been fun, but nothing Cress said compares to Blair's request. The 
former Gold Glove center fielder for the Baltimore Orioles asked that each 
member of the Bullets sign his baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kept saying, 'Can you even imagine you'd be one of his autographs,' " 
Cress said. "That was just amazing."

RESEDA HIGH'S GALAN ACCEPTS CSUN VOLLEYBALL SCHOLARSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pat Galan, a 6-foot-4 outside hitter from Reseda High, has accepted a 
scholarship to play volleyball at Cal State Northridge, his father said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Galan is the first Reseda player to sign with the Matadors since middle 
blocker Coley Kyman chose to play for Northridge in 1990. Kyman became a 
three-time All-American. 
</P>
<P>
 Galan, who took up volleyball as a sophomore, was a second-team All-City 
selection last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Justin Hamilton, from Clovis High in Fresno, said he also has signed with 
Northridge. Hamilton, a 6-6 left-hander, has been converted from an outside 
hitter to setter. MIKE HISERMAN

ATHLETIC OFFICIALS AT CSUN PLEDGE NOT TO GIVE UP; FINANCES: HIEGERT VOWS TO 
BRING THE FUNDING REFERENDUM, WHICH FAILED BY 87 VOTES, TO THE BALLOT BOX AGAIN 
NEXT FALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Athletic administrators at Cal State Northridge have altered an age-old 
rallying cry in the wake of a failed attempt to secure additional funding for 
the school's sports programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wait till next year" has become instead, "Wait till next semester." 
</P>
<P>
 A proposed fee increase for athletics was narrowly rejected in a vote by 
Northridge students this week, but Athletic Director Bob Hiegert pledged 
Thursday that similar legislation will be on the ballot again next fall. If a 
fee increase is not passed, the school faces the loss of its football program, 
Hiegert said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to come back with another referendum and we're going to get it 
passed," Hiegert said. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure failed, 993-906, although it passed, 892-875, among students 
polled at Northridge. Swinging the vote were results tabulated from the 
school's satellite campus in Ventura, where the proposal lost by a 118-14 
count. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next time we need to send our team to that campus," said women's volleyball 
Coach Lian Kang Lu, who had his players canvassing Northridge polling areas. 
"I'll drive them in my car." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal called for fee increases of $6 per semester beginning in the fall 
and growing to $40 by the fall of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Also failing, and by a far more lopsided margin, was a proposal to change the 
Northridge nickname. Only 392 votes were cast for a switch from Matadors to 
Quakes, a name that proponents argued would help the school capitalize on the 
Jan. 17 earthquake from a marketing standpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting to retain the nickname were 1,334 students, and 172 voted to change to 
another, unspecified nickname. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic officials had anticipated a close vote on the fee increase proposal. 
Last month, Judith Brame, Northridge's associate athletic director, challenged 
Northridge coaches to "play this one like it's a championship game" at a 
meeting during which the proposal was unveiled. 
</P>
<P>
 Several coaches took the advice to heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Softball and football players were required to vote before they were allowed 
to practice. As a result, the start of Northridge's first spring football 
workout was delayed more than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The future of football at Northridge hangs precariously in the balance as 
athletic officials begin to review their strategy for a second attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Gender-equity requirements that call for schools in the Cal State system to 
reach funding and participation parity in men's and women's sports by the 
1998-99 school year have left Northridge officials playing catch-up in a 
lopsided numbers game. 
</P>
<P>
 With additional funding, Northridge planned to add soccer and at least one 
other sport to its list of offerings for women. Without more money, Hiegert 
said, the school might be forced to slash its largest and most expensive men's 
program -- football -- to reach compliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of an agreement reached in October between the CSU system and the 
California chapter of the National Organization for Women, the 19 CSU campuses 
with NCAA athletic programs must: 
</P>
<P>
 * Provide athletic opportunities for women proportional to the number of 
NCAA-eligible female undergraduates on each campus, within 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Provide scholarships for women's sports in proportion to the number of 
eligible female undergraduates on each campus, within 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fund men's and women's sports programs within 10% of each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, about 65% of Northridge athletes are men, and male sports teams 
account for roughly 60% of the athletic program's budget for salaries, 
operations and scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the school's 1992-93 athletic budget, the elimination of football would 
have placed Northridge within the agreed funding guidelines and almost 
qualifying in terms of participation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out," Hiegert said. "Your 
resources wind up dictating your participation numbers. If you don't have the 
resources, you end up taking people off the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Similar dilemmas have forced the demise of football programs at Cal State Long 
Beach, Cal State Fullerton and Cal State Hayward. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayward announced the elimination of its football program earlier this year 
after students rejected a proposed fee increase similar to the one at 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, San Francisco State and Chico State have 
passed fee increases for athletics in recent years. However, none of those 
campuses faced a series of economic blows comparable to those absorbed by 
Northridge in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last five years in the state system have been ugly," said Gary Torgeson, 
the softball coach, "and here it's been worse because the earthquake left a lot 
of students around here out of work. Now is not exactly the best time to be 
asking for more money." 
</P>
<P>
 However, at least one factor -- a small voter turnout -- seemed to favor 
athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a department, we were relying on apathy," one coach said. "If you put 
ballots in people's hands (the proposal) goes down in flames. It's not even 
close." 
</P>
<P>
 Men's volleyball Coach John Price said the key for a second successful attempt 
will be voter education. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you get a referendum on the ballot that says, 'Do you want your fees 
increased?' you're going to get a lot of no votes," he said. "We need to get 
people out explaining the issue so the students can make an informed choice. If 
they understand it, they'll vote for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lu, who came to Northridge from UC Santa Barbara, advised school 
administrators to be persistent in their push for a fee increase. An athletics 
fee at Santa Barbara was rejected four times before it passed last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have good organization, you will win," Lu said. "'Failure is the 
foundation for success. When you fail, you learn."

ON BALANCE, SIMI VALLEY IS BETTER THAN BUENA; HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL: SEVEN 
PIONEERS REGISTER TWO HITS EACH DURING 17-7 VICTORY IN CAMARILLO TOURNAMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 If James Melcher and Jason Kimble had been in Simi Valley High's lineup 
instead of Buena's, they might have had spectacular games instead of merely 
impressive ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Melcher, the Bulldog left fielder, hit two homers and Kimble, the first 
baseman, hit one. Each scored three runs but the rest of Buena's hitting paled 
in comparison to that of the Pioneers, who pounded 16 hits Thursday and turned 
a close game into a 17-7 rout in the opening round of the Camarillo tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley (12-2) will play Canyon in the semifinals today. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena (8-5), which had 11 hits, trailed, 6-5, entering the bottom of the 
fourth but the Pioneers took advantage of defensive mistakes to score six and 
five runs in the fourth and fifth innings, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs committed four errors in those two innings and all but two runs 
off reliever J.C. Holt were unearned. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven Pioneers had two hits each and every starter but Aric Porro and Tim 
Nykoluk scored at least twice. 
</P>
<P>
 The offensive attack helped offset a sub-par pitching performance by Kary 
Kozlowski. In 3 1/3 innings, Kozlowski gave up three homers, including one to 
Melcher to open the game, and walked four. He gave up five earned runs.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were just hoping to get a few innings out of him," Simi Valley Coach Mike 
Scyphers said. "(His throwing arm) was a little tender and sore and he never 
(bounced back after the first inning)." 
</P>
<P>
 Kozlowski's teammates weren't worried. "We always seem to allow homers in 
every game," Nykoluk said. "And we always seem to recover." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pioneers didn't exactly use the long ball to blow open the game. 
Designated hitter Jeff Michael's fourth-inning triple and catcher Brian 
Kavanaugh's first-inning double were the only extra-base hits for Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of these days we were going to hit the ball really well, it was just (a 
matter of) when," Kavanaugh said. "But we always seem to come around enough at 
some point. It was a lot today," 
</P>
<P>
 While Simi Valley was scoring runs in bunches, Scyphers brought closer Jeff 
Weaver in early to slow the Bulldogs. Weaver gave up only one hit and no runs 
in 1 2/3 innings and picked up his first win. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even the prospect of facing left-handed pitching fazed the Pioneers. Both 
starter Mark Stehle and Holt are left-handers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I actually got fooled by a pitch on my second time around, but we didn't seem 
to have any problems," Kavanaugh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimble's homer came after he was sent to first base after only three balls in 
the count. The mistake was corrected and Kimble hit the second pitch over the 
left-field fence.

TAFT'S DESAUSSURE VIOLATED RULE, SAYS NCAA OFFICIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An NCAA official confirmed Thursday that Taft High sprinter Andre DeSaussure 
violated an NCAA rule regarding tryouts of recruits when he ran a leg on a 
400-meter relay in the Quincy Watts Invitational at USC last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule violation occurred March 26 when DeSaussure ran on a team that 
included Watts, the 1992 Olympic gold medalist in the 400 and 1,600 relay. 
Because the unattached team competed in a race that included teams from USC, 
Fresno State, Iowa and Boise State, DeSaussure's appearance violated an NCAA 
rule that prohibits schools from holding tryouts for a "prospective 
student-athlete." 
</P>
<P>
 If the meet had been considered an open competition -- in which college, club 
and high school athletes running unattached could have competed -- as opposed 
to a college meet, DeSaussure would not have broken any rules, according to 
Stan Wilcox of the NCAA legislative services offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as the meet is open to all competitors, whether they're from the 
club, collegiate or high school level, there would be no violation," he said. 
"But it is considered a tryout if a high school athlete participates in a meet 
which is considered a collegiate competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Lipkis, DeSaussure's personal coach, said he checked with the California 
Interscholastic Federation and the NCAA compliance office to be sure DeSaussure 
would not break any rules by competing in the meet. Apparently, he received 
incorrect information. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Tessalone, USC's sports information director, said earlier this week that 
the school informed the NCAA of the violation. The school has ceased recruiting 
DeSaussure and declared him ineligible to participate at USC but has petitioned 
the NCAA to restore his eligibility. It remains unclear if the NCAA will 
penalize USC or DeSaussure. 
</P>
<P>
 DeSaussure, the 1993 City Section champion in the 100, 200 and 400 meters, has 
personal bests of 10.72 seconds, 21.1 and 47.11 in those events. He was 
runner-up in the 400 in last year's state track and field championships. 
</P>
<P>
 A standout wide receiver, he also hopes to play college football.

BURROUGHS' SALLINEN CLEARS 16-0 1/4 IN VAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Burroughs High senior Esa Sallinen moved into a tie with Brian Goodman of 
Agoura for sixth place on the regional all-time pole vault list by clearing 
16-0 1/4 on his first attempt in a Foothill League dual meet Thursday at 
Burbank High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Finnish exchange student won the competition by clearing 13-0 on his first 
vault of the afternoon, and then had the bar raised to 15-8 -- one inch higher 
than Jon Switzer's school record set in 1976 -- which he also cleared on his 
first attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the record jump, the bar had been moved to 16-0, but another 
measurement yielded the additional quarter inch.

SALMON LOOKS LIKE HIS OLD SELF; ANGELS: A THREE-RUN HOMER AND FOUR RBIS HELP 
OUTFIELDER BREAK OUT OF EARLY-SEASON DOLDRUMS.

 Tim Salmon ended 1993 with a bang -- well, actually a slam. His grand slam 
Sept. 15 off Seattle's Tim Leary was a most fitting finale to a 31-homer, 
95-RBI Rookie of the Year season. 
</P>
<P>
 Until about 9 p.m. Thursday, however, 1994 pretty much had been one two-week 
whimper.

 In 34 at-bats before coming to the plate with two on and two out in the fifth 
inning Thursday, Salmon had struck out 13 times. In his previous 25 at-bats, he 
had managed only three singles. And Salmon was facing Toronto right-hander Juan 
Guzman, who has made more than his share of right-handed hitters look feeble 
and had already struck out Salmon in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 But Salmon, ahead in the count, 2-0, got a pitch he could handle and muscled 
it over the 370 sign in left field to give the Angels a 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in the seventh inning, Salmon got the best of Guzman again. With Jim 
Edmonds on first and two out, Salmon turned on an inside pitch and lined a shot 
inside third base and into the left-field corner to send Edmonds scampering 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 On those two swings, Salmon drove in as many runs has he had in any single 
game of his career -- you guessed it, Sept. 15, 1993 -- and increased his 1994 
runs-batted-in output by 200%. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was beginning to wonder if you guys were ever coming back," Salmon said to 
the crowd of reporters around his locker. "It's great to break out of it with a 
couple of hits and RBIs. It's a monkey off my back." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, runs batted in were the three little words the Angels had in mind 
when they signed Salmon to a four-year, $7.5-million contract in March. Last 
year had been a dream season for Salmon, who set club rookie records in home 
runs, doubles (35), extra-base hits (67) and walks (82) and became the 19th 
rookie in major league history to hit 30 or more home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Thursday night, however, the American League's rookie of the year was 
on a pace to drive in 36 runs. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was panicking about Salmon's slow start. In fact, Manager Buck Rodgers 
had predicted earlier this week that his young right fielder would soon be 
emerging from his funk. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to welcome him back," Rodgers said. "But you could see him coming 
around. He's been swinging the bat better, hitting the ball harder. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I'm not concerned about the strikeouts. Tim is going to strike out 100 
times and he's going to walk 100 times. You have to take the good with the bad 
with the RBI guys." 
</P>
<P>
 RBI guy. It has a nice ring to it for Salmon, who has been doing his best to 
block out some of the less complimentary descriptions he has heard lately from 
some of the fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just kept telling myself to be patient," he said. "I've been playing this 
game long enough to know it's just a matter of time. I start slow every year 
and it's just a matter of staying relaxed in the box and finding the rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys have been pitching me pretty tough and I've been helping them out by 
swinging at some bad pitches. But perspective is the biggest thing. In the 
past, I've been able to build on each month and hopefully, this will be another 
season like that."

RAMS MAKE A PROPOSAL TO OILER RECEIVER JEFFIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Following Wednesday's departure of wide receiver Henry Ellard to the 
Washington Redskins, the Rams have rekindled interest in Houston's Haywood 
Jeffires. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffires' agent, Fred Joseph, confirmed Thursday that the Rams have made a 
contract proposal to the unrestricted free agent. The proposal is believed to 
be a three-year deal worth $3.9 million, about $700,000 a year less than 
Jeffires has been seeking. 
</P>
<P>
 "We received a proposal from the Rams today (Thursday)," Joseph said. "And now 
we're talking to the Oilers to see what they offer. We also have other teams 
we're looking at. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably won't know anything until (Friday) morning. I still haven't had a 
chance to sit down with Haywood and talk about what we should do next." 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Zygmunt, Ram senior vice president, confirmed the Rams' proposal to 
Jeffires, saying only that it was a multiyear deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no feel for it," Zygmunt said. "We could be a phone call away from 
dropping it, or a phone call away from signing him." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington and Denver also pursued Jeffires, but the Broncos signed former 
Charger Anthony Miller in March, and the Redskins signed Ellard to a two-year, 
$1.8-million deal Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffires, who earned $900,000 last season with Houston, has indicated he would 
like to stay with the Oilers. Houston has made him a tentative offer worth $1.3 
million a year, but salary cap problems could prevent the team from increasing 
the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers' salary cap situation also has led to a major snag in the Rams' 
trade talks for Houston tackle Kevin Donnalley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers also are reluctant to deal Donnalley because they would still have 
to apply his $1-million signing bonus to their $34.6-million salary cap. 
Houston recently restructured backup quarterback Cody Carlson's contract and 
are trading starting quarterback Warren Moon and his $3.25-million contract to 
Minnesota because of cap problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a secret that we really like the guy (Donnalley)," Zygmunt said. 
"But I don't know how Houston could do it. That issue ($1 million in cap money) 
preempts it. But if they are willing to do something, so are we." 
</P>
<P>
 According to sources in Houston, the Rams offered one of their two 
second-round picks (47th overall) in the April 24-25 draft for Donnalley, whom 
the Rams planned to start at left tackle. But the Oilers have indicated they 
want the Rams' other second-round pick (32nd overall). 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have been interested since February in Donnalley, who was a 
restricted free agent until the Oilers signed him last week. The Rams had 
signed him to an offer sheet, but the Oilers matched it and then signed him. 
</P>
<P>
 In other news, the Rams have scheduled a Tuesday workout for free-agent wide 
receiver Wesley Carroll of the Cincinnati Bengals.

COLLEGE BASEBALL ROUNDUP; DAVIS, CANYONS SLAM DOOR ON PIERCE, 13-9 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Johnny Davis hit a two-out grand slam in the bottom of the ninth inning 
Thursday to give College of the Canyons a 13-9 victory over Pierce in a Western 
State Conference game at Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyons, which trailed, 7-0, in the second inning, chipped away at the deficit 
with a pair of runs in each of the second, third and fifth innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce (18-13, 10-6 in conference play) increased its advantage to 9-6 with 
two runs in the sixth, but Canyons (11-15, 7-9) again pulled to within one with 
two runs in the bottom of the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyons tied the score, 9-9, in the eighth inning when Tommy Nickels' two-out 
single drove home Davis.  
</P>
<P>
 Nickels was three for five and drove in four runs, including two with a 
second-inning homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Milligan of Pierce was three for four with five RBIs, including a 
three-run homer in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuesta 9, Oxnard 6 -- Robert Sanchez went two for three and drove in a pair of 
runs, Jess Olivares went three for four, and Jason Young doubled twice and 
drove in a run for the Condors (12-16, 7-8), but it wasn't enough in a WSC game 
at Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Joey Vargas (4-4), coming off of a 12-inning victory in his last start, took a 
4-2 lead into the seventh inning for the Condors, having scattered five hits. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom dropped out for the knuckleball pitcher when Cuesta rallied for 
three hits and a walk to start a four-run rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark 15, Santa Barbara 1 -- The Raiders (14-13-1, 7-7-1) scored all their 
runs in the first five innings of a WSC game at Moorpark.

</P>
<P>
 Aaron Fischer had two hits including a home run and three RBIs.

game of the season for the Vaqueros (10-15-1, 8-7-1) in a WSC game at Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The sophomore left-hander struck out five, walked four, and scattered nine 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Armando Mesa drove in three runs for the Vaqueros in a two-for-three 
performance, and sophomore Lance Evans drove in two more runs while hitting a 
pair of doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield 8, Valley 1 -- Bakersfield parlayed three hits, an error, two 
walks and a hit batter into a five-run fifth inning that led the Renegades to a 
WSC victory at Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Vic Seper was two for three and drove in Marlon Hamilton with the only run for 
Valley (9-15-1, 7-9) in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Baptist 3-2, The Master's 2-4 -- Kenya Hunt hit a pair of home runs for 
The Master's during an NAIA District 3 doubleheader split at Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunt hit a two-run home run in the first game and a solo shot in the second. 
He has five home runs this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Davis (3-1) picked up the victory in the second game, allowing five hits, 
two runs, striking out three and walking four in 6 2/3 innings of relief for 
the Mustangs (11-25-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Beck pitched a seven-hitter and struck out 11 in the first game but took

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: CLINTON HAS A WINNING DISPOSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Newbury Park High right-hander Ray Clinton swears he's not doing it on 
purpose. His teammate, Keith Smith, doesn't particularly care why he's doing 
it, as long as it keeps working. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who is 7-3, is three victories away from tying the school 
single-season record, but three of his victories have been in games Smith has 
started. Twice, Smith has left the mound, handing a lead to Clinton, only to 
watch Clinton blow it and earn the victory for himself when Newbury Park came 
back to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying not to do that," Clinton said. "I'm really trying to get the 
hitters out." 
</P>
<P>
 Against Simi Valley on April 6, Smith handed Clinton a 6-3 lead in the 
seventh. The Pioneers tied the score off Clinton, but the Panthers won, 8-6, in 
extra innings. Against Thousand Oaks on Wednesday, Smith left with a 5-3 lead 
in the sixth. Again, Clinton allowed the tying run to score, but the Panthers 
won the game, 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also relieved Smith with the score tied, 3-3, on March 23 against 
Channel Islands. Newbury Park won that game, 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care," Smith said. "He's doing a great job. If I can't get the win, 
let him get it. We're 5-0 in league and that's all that matters." 
</P>
<P>
 All five league victories, by the way, belong to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park and Thousand Oaks players shook hands before their game 
Wednesday, abiding by the intent of the new rule that prohibits postgame 
handshakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Not coincidentally, several television stations had cameras at the game to do 
stories on the much-publicized rule. CHANNEL LEAGUE

 Digging in the Dirt 
</P>
<P>
 When Oxnard traveled south of the border to play a doubleheader against 
Plantel Mexicali II, the Yellowjackets were surprised when they saw the field. 
It was all dirt. No grass anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rocks, glass, the whole deal," Oxnard Coach Jack Dalton said. "I told the 
guys that if we didn't do well, they'd let the bulls out." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard must have learned how to play the field as the day went on. After 
losing the first game, 13-4, the Yellowjackets won the second, 7-6. NORTHWEST

 Greentree Plays Defense 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Greentree is holding his ground. Those who believe his Chatsworth boys' 
basketball team had a disappointing season simply don't know the details, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A rival coach went so far as to say that the Chancellors were as talented as 
any team in the City Section 4-A Division, with the possible exception of 
eventual champion Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Greentree, who resigned as coach last week to spend more time with his family 
and pursue his various real estate ventures, cites the teams the Chancellors 
played en route to a 13-8 record. Dorsey, San Diego Lincoln and nationally 
ranked Oak Hill (Va.) are but a few. Dorsey and Lincoln advanced to a section 
final or beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those preseason (tournament) games were for the development of the team," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chancellors, who picked up a slew of young transfers last fall, didn't 
play together in the spring or summer seasons. Most of the team's top players, 
including sophomores Eddie Miller and Jerome Joseph and junior Tariq Hill, have 
plenty of basketball ahead of them. Point guard Isaiah Thomas played on the 
varsity as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio already helped Chatsworth win the West Valley League title. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played lots of good teams in those tournaments," Greentree said. "I still 
think we had a good season. This was a young team." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Just about the last thing on Darren Angel's mind after he hit his first shot 
Monday afternoon was a course record at Knollwood Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 The Granada Hills junior recovered from a bogey on the first hole in a match 
against Simi Valley to shoot a course-record 63 on the par-72 course. Angel was 
10 strokes under par over the final 15 holes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the first shot was not a thing of beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was absolutely horrible," Angel said. "It went about 150 yards and wound 
up near somebody's backyard. I just hit it so bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Angel may have been helped by a home-court advantage. Knollwood is the home 
course for the Highlanders and Angel tied the previous course record with a 64 
two weeks ago.

 Trivia question: Who holds the regional record in the 300 intermediate 
hurdles? Hint: He won a Heisman Trophy. FOOTHILL LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Overlooked Effort 
</P>
<P>
 He did not win any events like Jeremy Fischer of Camarillo (high jump), Jamaal 
Chase of Quartz Hill (long jump) or Esa Sallinen of Burroughs (pole vault), but 
Jason Medearis of Hart might have had the most impressive performance by any 
area athlete during the Arcadia Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 Medearis finished third in the 110-meter high hurdles and second in the 300 
intermediates with school-record times of 14.12 and 37.42 seconds. He also ran 
a strong 400 leg on the Indians' distance medley relay team that placed fifth 
in 10 minutes 28.82 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Medearis' times in the hurdles moved him into fifth on the all-time regional 
list in the intermediates and seventh in the highs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Charles White. He ran 36.4 in the 330-yard intermediates as a 
San Fernando High senior in 1976. The time is equivalent to a 36.2 clocking for 
the 300-meter intermediates. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff writers Steve Elling, Jeff Fletcher, Michael Lazarus and John Ortega 
contributed to this notebook. Joining the Chase 
</P>
<P>
 Jamaal Chase of Quartz Hill moved to sixth on the all-time regional list in 
the boys' long jump when he leaped 24 feet 2 1/4 inches to win Saturday's

TURNING IT AROUND; FOOTHILL'S CHURNOCK CONQUERS NERVES, PULLS HER SOFTBALL GAME 
OUT OF THE DIRT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE LACQUES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was nearly two years ago, but Foothill High junior shortstop Michelle 
Churnock remembers the 1992 Southern Section 4-A softball championship game 
against Newhall Hart as if it were yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
 Churnock, then a freshman starting on a senior-dominated team, had struggled 
at the plate and in the field that season, and was hoping to reverse her 
fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Starting as a freshman in a CIF championship game, I was very nervous," she 
said. "I told myself that I was ready to play, but deep down, I wasn't. Then 
you get out there, and there's all sorts of people in the stands. It was 
overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember the first grounder hit to me during warm-ups. I threw it in the 
dirt." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the game started. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were wearing our white jerseys that game," she said, "and one of the first 
plays I had was a ground ball to short. I got the ball and looked up, and the 
first white shirt I saw was someone standing in the dugout, and I threw it 
toward them instead of at the first baseman." 
</P>
<P>
 When Churnock returned to the dugout after her error, "she was a basket case," 
Foothill Coach Joe Gonzalez said. "We told her 'just make the plays' . . . and 
she did." 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill went on to win the game and the title, 5-2, and Churnock has since 
calmed her nerves and improved her abilities enough to become one of the 
premier shortstops in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Her turnaround has been remarkable. Her freshman year, Churnock had the lowest 
batting average on Foothill's team (.216), and committed the most errors (16). 
</P>
<P>
 But last year, she more than doubled her average (.437), cut her errors to 
seven, and stole 26 bases to earn first-team Times Orange County and 
all-section Division I honors. Foothill, however, was eliminated by Marina in 
the second round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, her improvement has continued. Coming into this week, she was 
fourth in the county in batting average (.538), fourth in stolen bases (17), 
and has been a steadying influence defensively on a team with no seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 So how did Churnock transform herself from a no-hit, poor-field freshman to a 
top-notch junior? 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never seen a kid who works like she does," Gonzalez said. "She takes 
hitting lessons once a week, and she always wants to take extra ground balls. 
If we don't cut her off at 100, she'll be there till dark. As soon as batting 
practice is over, she goes to the weight room and works out." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the extra hitting and fielding practice Churnock takes, it might be 
her work in the off-season with Mater Dei assistant Doug Myers that has helped 
her the most. Myers has helped Churnock increase her speed, and Gonzalez says 
that's what makes her so valuable to the ninth-ranked Knights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Softball is a game dominated by pitchers, so when you've got someone with 
that kind of speed, she can dominate a game," Gonzalez said. "She has an 
ability to get us something that might not be there. If she bounces the ball 
twice to the shortstop, she's on. And when she gets on, we win." 
</P>
<P>
 Churnock demonstrated this Tuesday in Foothill's Century League opener against 
Orange. Foothill pitcher Marie Gieron didn't give up any runs, and Orange's 
Lindsay Huebner had trouble only when Churnock got on base. In the first 
inning, she beat out a bunt single, stole second and scored on a single. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second, Churnock came up with two outs and a runner on third. She 
bounced a grounder to short that should have gotten Orange out of the inning. 
But Churnock blazed down the line, extending herself to beat the throw and give 
Foothill another run. The Knights won, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 While Churnock has handled her on-the-field chores with relative ease, she was 
handed the unexpected burden of providing team leadership this season when Amy 
Tessman, the Knights' only senior and top pitcher, abruptly quit two weeks ago. 
Tessman was 6-1 with a 0.81 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 But Churnock said Tessman's departure has only helped get her ready her for 
next year, and hasn't curtailed the team's goals this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "When she officially quit, it was a disappointment to everybody," Churnock 
said. "But the team has pulled together, and you move on and better yourself. 
It's a way for me to prepare for next year, because that's (leading the team) 
what I'll be doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to see my team accomplish a league championship, and win (a section 
title)," she said. "I think we have a good chance to take CIF. Hopefully, 
league will prepare us for that. We have a lot of ability, and potential. I 
think we're pretty strong and we can handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 And should Foothill (13-6) reach the final again, you can bet Churnock will be 
a lot more composed.

 The fall shows that ended here Wednesday won't go down in history as a 
compendium of the most uninspired, sleazy and at times absurd fashions, but not 
for designers' lack of trying. 
</P>
<P>
 Never have designers dithered so much over hemlines and silhouettes and 
fabrics -- will neoprene ball gowns herald the new millennium? -- only to come 
up with solutions that grown-up, modern women have no earthly use for. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more incomprehensible was how the front-row fashion dragons in their 
dark, prim suits and sensible pumps could embrace crotch-high skirts or dowdy, 
just-below-the-knee styles that made Kate Moss look like a PTA president; Day 
Glo-bright fake fur; slutty schoolgirl outfits (shrunken mohair sweaters, tiny 
plaid kilts and over-the-knee stockings) and spike-heeled high boots that 
haven't been seen since "Barbarella." 
</P>
<P>
 As conceived by Seventh Avenue, the new fall woman eschews broad-shouldered 
tailored suits like those worn by her husband for babyish sweater dresses 
appropriate for her preteen daughter. She adores plaids, pin stripes and very 
bright orange. She has clothes for every occasion -- skintight rubberized gym 
wear, ski caps and shearling coats, flippy satin dance dresses -- but hardly 
anything to wear to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the more outrageous numbers, of course, evaporate after their 15 
minutes of runway fame. They're served up to amuse and titillate the audience 
and reap reams of publicity. Veteran fashion hounds know that those tiny, 
sawed-off skirts and some of those shrunken sweaters will grow a few inches 
before being shipped to stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know to take what's on the runway with a grain of salt," said Joan Kaner, 
senior vice president and fashion director of Neiman Marcus. "After one of the 
coldest winters on record, do you really think stores are going to endorse 
little skirts and bare legs?" 
</P>
<P>
 If there was one designer to write home about in a week of disappointments, it 
was Richard Tyler, who, next to Mel Gibson, is probably the best thing 
Australia ever exported. 
</P>
<P>
 Both his Anne Klein and signature collections solidified his reputation, not 
just as a superb tailor but as a designer with a clear, distinctive vision. His 
clothes were lean, young, thoroughly contemporary and a touch romantic. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler's Anne Klein line epitomized snappy, all-American sportswear, with its 
medley of textures -- pebbly knits, gauzy wools, Ultrasuede and velvet -- and 
streamlined silhouettes that emphasized narrow, fitted jackets over tapered 
pants or little flared skirts. 
</P>
<P>
 His spare, fitted suits (whose jackets were a tad shorter this season) and 
deep-hued, autumn palette of charcoal, brown and loden were enlivened by little 
details, such as Tyrolean embroidery or shearling collars and cuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to his Anne Klein line, Tyler's eponymous collection was less sporty, 
more expensive and filled with such sybaritic fabrics as cashmere and brocade. 
It offered the same controlled tailoring, but with a bit more romance. 
</P>
<P>
 An opening series of military-style, olive-drab shirt-dresses and officer's 
jackets, accessorized with jaunty caps and riding boots, gave way to the frock 
coats, patterned vests and jodhpurs that dominated the collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Outfits were assembled in tranquil, muted colors -- misty gray, mocha, celadon 
-- and myriad textures: A pale pink wool riding jacket was paired with a deep 
rose brocade vest, a soft green chiffon blouse and olive jodhpurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Less satisfying were the evening styles by the designer, who divides his time 
between New York and Los Angeles. They included bias-cut satin slip dresses and 
embroidered bathrobe coats that summoned visions of Jean Harlow. But a simple 
black velvet dress with a fishtail train was a knockout. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Lauren's wholesale pillage of English history, from King Arthur's court 
to Edwardian country manors, was a regrettable example of how a talented 
designer can cross the line that separates clothes from costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 One more velvet tunic embroidered with a gold cross, one more stiff white 
Edwardian ruff and one more jacket shaped to look like medieval armor would 
have been one too many. 
</P>
<P>
 Lauren succeeded when he stopped rummaging through the ancestral attic and 
concentrated on the refined, classic sportswear that put him on the map. In 
this category would be his little kilts in lush plaid mohair, his impeccably 
cut tweed riding jackets and tailored pantsuits, his angora sweaters, and some 
of the best brass-buttoned coats around. 
</P>
<P>
 No one would have been surprised to see tears trickle down the cheeks of the 
pale, frail models who padded down the runway in Calvin Klein's dark, 
minimalist collection, which was given a polite, if unenthusiastic, reception 
by a puzzled audience. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's big shocker was the hemlines on shifts or empire dresses and 
pleated skirts that hovered around the knee or a mite below. Klein was on the 
right track in lowering hemlines -- if skirts get any shorter they'll wind up 
as belts -- but why he chose the dowdy length favored by middle-aged matrons is 
mystifying. 
</P>
<P>
 There were some lovely pea jackets and camel coats and a few stunning navy 
pantsuits. But how one longed for them to be in gentler colors, with just a 
whimsical detail or accessory to lighten things up and make the models look 
fresh and beautiful, like they used to in Klein's shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Karan's best idea was to enlist a variety of models -- Veruschka, Patti 
Hansen, Isabella Rossellini, fortysomethings Dayle Haddon and Beverly Johnson, 
plus the usual youth brigade -- for the final show of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Her worst idea was to outfit them in her fall collection. Its key look was a 
black satin "Butterfield 8" slip dress throbbing beneath a black leather trench 
coat. Sheer black stockings, spike-heeled shoe-boots and a tough, 
don't-mess-with-me expression completed the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna, Donna, Donna, how could you? Is this the same designer who gave us the 
jersey bodysuit, the sexy sarong skirt, all the modern, streamlined separates? 
The Donna who liberated executive women from their Mildred Pierce uniforms? Who 
now espouses tight jersey skirts teamed with see-through bodysuits revealing 
lacy, uplift bras? Or hot-colored angora suits that cling to every curve? 
</P>
<P>
 More sedate were Karan's new asymmetrical wrap dresses. They dipped in pointy 
folds on the sides, looking somewhat busy and awkward, but won points for being 
wool, not satin and lace.

FAUX JEWELRY, REAL VALUE; SOME COLLECTIBLES ARE WORTH THEIR WEIGHT IN . . . 
WELL, YOU GET THE PICTURE

 A Madame Gripoix necklace made and sold in the 1960s for less than $100 
recently brought $1,955 at a New York auction. Why so much for a piece of 
costume jewelry? 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, the name Gripoix, a designer who worked with couture houses to 
accessorize their pricey clothes, carries weight with collectors. And so does 
workmanship. Costume jewelry made from the 1920s to the 1960s was often created 
in the same way as fine jewelry, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1920s, designers stopped making fakes to look like jewelry from 
Tiffany, Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels and started creating original pieces 
from non-precious stones. The material shortages during the Depression and 
World War II initially gave them impetus. But later, costume-jewelry designers 
broke away and made pieces that were bolder, livelier and brighter than their 
more expensive cousins. (Coco Chanel is credited with coining the term "costume 
jewelry"; she and other apparel designers preferred creating faux bijoux to 
complement the look of specific outfits.) 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the designs made for top fashion houses such as Chanel, Hattie 
Carnegie and Schiaparelli, upscale costume pieces were made by Miriam Haskell, 
Eisenberg and Trifari in the '30 and '40s. Mass-market lines, such as Coro, 
Napier and Weiss, proliferated in the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 With fabulous fakes selling for hundreds and thousands of dollars now, is it 
too late to start a collection? No. Antique shops, flea markets and auctions 
offer myriad pieces at reasonable prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "A piece is worth what you get for it," said Nina Khodorovsky, owner of 
Antiques 4 U in Newport Beach. "I have collectors who will buy any jewelry by 
Miriam Haskell over the phone without even seeing it." 
</P>
<P>
 What should one look for in a piece of vintage costume jewelry? 
</P>
<P>
 The most important element is a good, strong design. It should be detailed, 
extravagant and glamorous. 
</P>
<P>
 Make sure the stones are prong-set, not glued, and that each stone is in 
place, with no obvious repairs. Each pearl in a necklace should be individually 
knotted in place. Keep in mind that movable parts on a brooch or necklace add 
to the value. Turn the piece over to check for joints and open-back settings, 
because they also indicate craftsmanship. Signed works often go for more, but 
not always. 
</P>
<P>
 Another way of getting started is to rummage through shoe boxes in relatives' 
houses and to check antique stores and garage sales for a rare, well-designed 
piece. You may have a story to tell like the one of a dealer who sold a Madame 
Gripoix faux pearl and glass diamond necklace at 6 a.m. for $80. In the next 
hour, another dealer bought it for $450. By the end of the day, it was going 
for $1,500.

WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT AHAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Things to know when shopping for a low-priced alpha hydroxy acid product: 
</P>
<P>
 * AHAs generally cause less skin irritation than prescription Retin-A 
products. Still, stinging may occur.And some users report an increase in 
blemishes for the first few weeks as impurities are brought to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drugstore cosmeticians (see Directory, E4) can offer additional information 
on products and help consumers choose the best items for their skin types. 
</P>
<P>
 * People with sensitive skin should consider face products with the minimal 4% 
concentration. 
</P>
<P>
 * Contents are listed in decreasing order of concentration. Look for a product 
that has a fruit acid as one of the top four ingredients, manufacturers 
suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 * The concentration isn't always clearly stated on packaging. Some companies 
offer the information through their consumer hot lines; others don't. Says a 
L'Oreal spokeswoman: "We don't talk about percentages." 
</P>
<P>
 * A product's overall effectiveness may hinge on non-AHA ingredients as well 
as on its pH level. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some products contain ingredients that may be mistaken for AHAs. The Revlon 
Results line, for example, contains a neutral, not acidic, molecule. Product 
literature says it offers the benefits of AHAs without the stinging. KATHLEEN

SMOOTHER FOR CHEAPER; YOU DON'T NEED TO SPEND A MONTH'S WORTH OF LUNCH MONEY TO 
FIGHT WRINKLES. FRUIT-ACID PRODUCTS PROMISING TO DO THE TRICK FOR LESS ARE 
HERE.

 Wrinkle-fighting creams with alpha hydroxy acids, the hot new thing in 
cosmetics, can have price tags as breathtak ing as the promises in their 
advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
 Estee Lauder's Fruition Triple ReActivating Complex is $42.50 per ounce, and 
Chanel's Day Lift Oil-Refining Complex costs even more. But these and other 
high-end products face growing competition. Dozens of lower-priced creams and 
gels containing the natural fruit acids known collectively as AHAs are getting 
prominent, if inelegant, displays on the shelves of grocery, drug and 
health-food stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The makers of these products, some one-fifth the price of their 
department-store cousins, want to convince age-conscious consumers that they 
don't need to break the bank or resort to chemical peels to slow the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the fruit-acid wrinkle-reducers available or expected soon in 
drugstores: 
</P>
<P>
 * Pond's Age-Defying Complex, $10.99 for two ounces, out since February. 
</P>
<P>
 * Alpha Hydrox's Enhanced Gel Complex, $9 for two ounces, to join the 
company's lineup of six AHA products in May. 
</P>
<P>
 * L'Oreal's Plenitude ExCELL-A3 label, also to roll out in May and include a 
Skin Revealing Lotion ($11.50 for two ounces) and Skin Revealing Cream ($11.50 
for 1.4 ounces). 
</P>
<P>
 * Jason Natural Cosmetics' In Harmony With Nature line, including day cream, 
night cream and other products, in health-food and drug stores. Its 10% AHA 
night cream is $25 for one ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cosmania's the Nature Club Skin Renewal System, launched in December with 
five products. The Daily Moisture Complex is $7.99 for four ounces. 
</P>
<P>
 The low-end AHA business is exploding, a cosmetician for a large San Fernando 
Valley drugstore says. She gets regular telephone inquiries about the 
availability of specific products and has trouble keeping the shelves stocked. 
Alerted by advance advertising, some customers call for an item that has yet to 
arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Makers of these new, cheaper lines aim to bury what they call the "If it's not 
expensive, it can't work" myth. Why spend $40, they ask, when 10 bucks or less 
might do just fine? 
</P>
<P>
 There lies the rub, of course. Not everyone agrees that the cheaper formulas 
will do as good a job of diminishing facial lines and other date-of-birth 
clues. The lower-end formulas contain AHA concentrations of 4% to 10%, 
contrasted with 8% to 15% in more expensive ones. The latter also include 
ingredients essential to firming and toning, their proponents say, as well as a 
better "vehicle" to deliver the acids to the skin. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder consumers struggle to decide: Which AHA product will best help me 
lie about my age? Those tempted to take the ostrich approach and wait for the 
next miracle potion should know that many experts echo the observation of 
Jeffrey Light, president of Jason Natural Cosmetics: "AHAs are a part of our 
lives, from now on." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the beauty business always seems to have another miracle in the 
works, even manufacturers eyeing that next hush-hush line or ingredient say AHA 
sales will likely boom for quite some time. "At the rate it's going, retail 
sales of AHA products could total a half-billion dollars this year," says Allan 
Mottus, publisher of the Informationist, a New York-based industry newsletter. 
Other observers believe $300 million is closer to the mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Although their commercial popularity is recent, AHAs have been around since 
Cleopatra, who reportedly bathed in sour milk to reap the benefits of lactic 
acid, one of the acids commonly listed in AHA products. (Others include 
glycolic, malic, tartaric and citric acids.) 
</P>
<P>
 Fast-forward to 1992, when Avon introduced its Anew Perfecting Complex, which 
took in $70 million its first year. Prestige lines of AHAs soon began popping 
up in department stores. Today, AHAs seem to be everywhere and in everything: 
moisturizing face creams for day or night, face washes, gels, 
toner-astringents, and hand and body lotions. Next up will be cuticle 
treatments and shave creams containing fruit acids, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Although formulas vary, glycolic acid is the current darling of most 
manufacturers, especially for face products. "By and large, glycolic acid 
molecules are more active," says Dr. Howard Murad, a UCLA assistant clinical 
professor of dermatology who produces his own line of AHA products. 
</P>
<P>
 The fruit acids work, experts speculate, by loosening the bonds among dead 
cells on the skin surface and speeding the natural shedding, or exfoliation, 
process. The shedding, in turn, exposes new skin, which feels softer and 
smoother and holds moisture better, Murad says. 
</P>
<P>
 "You start to see a smoother texture," says Alex Znaiden, who helped develop 
Avon Anew and works for Chesebrough Ponds. Over time, AHAs can help soften the 
skin and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, manufacturers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Better results can be had via the more concentrated fruit acids dispensed by 
aestheticians and dermatologists. For severe wrinkles, a chemical peel with up 
to a 70% acid concentration might be needed, says Dr. Robert Kotler, a Beverly 
Hills facial plastic surgeon who developed a buffered chemical peel. Such a 
procedure requires a general anesthesia, substantial recovery time and can cost 
about $5,000, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Inexpensive products probably can't hurt, Kotler says, and they might be a 
good starting point for some consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 The cosmetic industry uses the word cosmeceuticals to describe AHA products, 
implying a cosmetic-drug hybrid, but the Food and Drug Administration regards 
them strictly as cosmetics. The agency has looked into AHA products, spokesman 
Mike Shaffer says. "We're not aware of any injuries," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 If the right product for a specific skin type is applied faithfully, what can 
a consumer realistically expect? 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost everyone will have smoother, softer skin," Murad says, adding: "The 
worse you look to start, the better you can expect to look." 
</P>
<P>
 Some changes for the better may show up within two weeks of regular use, some 
manufacturers say, with the reduction in the appearance of fine lines occurring 
around the two-month mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Murad has compared "before" and "after" photos of patients using his products 
-- ranging in AHA concentration from 8% to 15% -- for at least two years. The 
appearance of new wrinkles in that time was virtually nil, he says. But he 
tells patients that AHAs are only part of the story -- using sunscreens and 
taking care of the body, inside and out, are essential to minimizing the 
effects of aging. 
</P>
<P>
 Those wary of trying AHAs should consider a short trial run, experts say. 
"After three to six months, if you are not happy (with the results), seek a 
consultation with a health professional," Kotler suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 And if fruit acids don't make a difference, a consumer can always hope for the 
next miracle cream to close the gap between expectations and results. Although 
Pond's Znaiden expects AHAs to be hot for a long time, he's already tinkering 
with a new wrinkle remedy. The next buzz product? Phytic acid. Found in nuts 
and seeds, and a natural antioxidant, it's "being investigated as the next 
generation of cosmeceutical," he says. AHA Products for $25 or Less

NOW SELLING: STREISAND PRIME SEATS; POP MUSIC: SIX AREA CHARITIES HOLDING 
TICKETS TO THE ANAHEIM CONCERTS SAY LACK OF PUBLICITY ON THEIR AVAILABILITY IS 
HURTING SALES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The frenzied public sale of Barbra Streisand tickets last month was over in a 
flash, but it only marked the beginning of a slow and laborious process for six 
area charities. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 500 prime seats for each of six shows May 25 through June 4 at the 
Pond in Anaheim were set aside to be sold by the organizations, providing a 
chance for each to make as much as $325,000. But some of the charities are 
worrying that sales are going too slowly, and they blame a difficulty in 
publicizing the tickets' availability. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting the word out is hard and none of us wants to spend tens of thousands 
of dollars on advertising," says Richard Walden, president of Operation USA/LA 
Earthquake Relief, which holds 450 tickets to the June 2 concert. So far, 50 of 
them have been sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the charities was given the chance to pay face value -- $350 -- for 
the tickets, which then could be sold for as much as $1,000 each. The 
charities' profit from each ticket would be tax-deductible for the buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Walden said he and his staff have called ticket brokers in the area 
anonymously and have found that equivalent seats are selling for $1,200 to 
$1,500. However, he said, "we don't have the money the ticket brokers have to 
advertise. We've been forced to be very creative about how we find people." 
</P>
<P>
 He said his efforts have been coordinated with those of other charities to 
avoid an "arms race"; a joint ad recently was placed in the Western edition of 
the New York Times. A paid ad taken out by Operation USA will appear in 
Sunday's L.A. Times Calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles has sold 75 of its 500 tickets, but 
President Charles Palmer sounded less concerned than Walden, saying he expects 
sales to pick up as the concert approaches. He agreed, though, that greater 
publicity would make for a more successful effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand's strategy for assisting charities is an unusual one. A spokesman 
for the singer said one goal was to partially circumvent the efforts of brokers 
by forcing them to compete with charities who have direct access to prime 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spokespersons for all the organizations contacted said the system has some 
benefits beyond a straight monetary donation. For instance, each organization 
will be spotlighted during one of the Anaheim concerts, leading to greater 
publicity and a higher profile. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort "has been a real shot in the arm for our staff, who often don't get 
this kind of recognition for their work," Palmer said. "We are of course very 
grateful. Like many groups, we have had to operate under terrible financial 
straits as a result of recession." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very happy about it," Walden said. "Of course, we'd prefer to be sold 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 * The following charities have Streisand tickets available: For May 25, the 
National Resources Defense Council/Pesticide Campaign, (310) 996-1188; for May 
27, the Alliance for Children's Rights, (310) 393-5600; for May 29, Girls' 
Voices Women's Lives, (310) 478-3002; for May 31, the Legal Aid Foundation, 
(310) 477-0672; for June 2, Operation USA/LA Earthquake Relief, (310) 559-6370; 
for June 4, United Friends of the Children, (213) 651-2988.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: TO CRITICS OF 'SOUTH CENTRAL': WHAT A JOKE; TELEVISION: THE 
FOX SERIES HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF PERPETUATING STEREOTYPES ABOUT BLACKS AND

 On the stage, a black comic is simulating receiving oral sex. As the black 
studio audience hoots, his body becomes a fast-pumping piston, his eyelids the 
fluttery blur of someone having a seizure, his voice a guttural expression of 
orgasmic grunts.

 Memo to critics of "South Central," the rewarding new Fox series about a 
heroic black single parent and her three kids battling for survival in a 
relatively volatile section of Los Angeles: 
</P>
<P>
 Tune in "Russell Simmons' Def Comedy Jam" on HBO.

 Public protests against "South Central" have come mostly from blacks who 
accuse the half-hour comedy/drama hybrid of advancing a stereotype of them as a 
savage, dysfunctional underclass and the area of the city the series depicts as 
little more than a crime-ridden war zone. To put it in terms that Hollywood 
understands, "South Central" is lousy P.R. 
</P>
<P>
 Unsaid but surely implied by much of the criticism is that "South Central," in 
a broad sense, presents blacks driven entirely by animal urges alien to 
civilized (translation: white) society. The series doesn't do that, of course, 
preferring instead to humanize its black protagonists in ways that make 
outsiders understand their problems, admire their close bond and care for them 
deeply. But the eye of the beholder is the reality that counts most. 
</P>
<P>
 How curious that "Def Comedy Jam" -- which airs at midnight on Fridays -- 
seems to have escaped the harsh laser light of "South Central" detractors. It 
certainly has eluded their stinging criticism. How is it that a 
well-intentioned series like "South Central" gets verbally dynamited in some 
circles while the race-mocking, female-debasing "Def Comedy Jam" -- a weekly 
half-hour that ghettoizes black stand-up comics in a "Soul Train" of semen 
jokes and rapspeak that makes the Kingfish of "Amos 'n' Andy" sound like James 
Earl Jones -- gets off bruise-free? 
</P>
<P>
 A New York-based showcase for black stand-ups, "Def Comedy Jam" begins its 
fourth season in July with Joe Torry replacing muck-mouthed Martin Lawrence 
(the star of Fox's "Martin") as host. Until then HBO will continue airing 
reruns, and most recently has been showing episodes from the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
 From the opening "Whaz happenin'?" to the final credits, "Def Comedy Jam" is 
verbal mud wallowing that proudly wears its in-your-face machismo smut like a 
chest full of medals. It's television's equivalent of a public toilet where 
crude words and expressions are gratuitously spoken instead of being scrawled 
on walls. Not only does the "S" word for defecation hit the fan, but so do a 
host of other tailored-for-cable expletives. During a recent three-episode 
span, Lawrence and his co-comics spewed the "F" synonym for sexual intercourse 
a combined 37 times and the "MF" word 40 times. These words roll off their 
tongues like spittle. Not far behind are coarse synonyms for male and female 
body parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the monologues, and nearly all of Lawrence's comments, project raunchy 
sex and communicate through lewd body language that reminds you of a couple of 
doggies doing it. Probably 90% of the comics are male, and led by Lawrence 
himself, their sex-slinging routines refer mostly to faceless women (not 
infrequently referred to as "bitches") servicing men in ways that reduce 
females to notches on a gun handle. 
</P>
<P>
 "A horny woman is the scariest thing on the planet," a stand-up named Mike 
Bonner said on a recent show in which he described arriving home and finding 
his "woman" standing before him "butt-ass-naked" and desperate for oral sex. On 
another recent show, comic Kenny Howell warmed up by smacking his lips over 
"pretty ladies" with "big old" breasts before undertaking the primary theme of 
his monologue -- a detailed description of a male bringing a female to orgasm. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same episode, comics Bill Bellamy and George Willborn took on the topic 
of jailed former heavyweight champ Mike Tyson, both charging that he was set up 
by Desiree Washington, the 18-year-old beauty contestant he was convicted of 
raping in the wee hours of the morning. In a routine reminiscent of Nation of 
Islam Minister Louis Farrakhan's televised women-mean-yes-when-they-say-say-no 
sermon at a "Free Mike" rally included in Barbara Kopple's award-winning NBC 
documentary about Tyson, Willborn began: 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike in jail. And why? Why, ladies? Three o'clock in the morning. Come to my 
house at three o'clock in the morning. Come to my house at noon." The studio 
audience howled. "It don't make no damn sense!" Willborn added before doing his 
impression of Washington having sex with Tyson, and loving it. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, someone will depart from the penis jokes and other carnal 
material to deliver a monologue with social bite. For example, Bonner's routine 
included a section about feds staked out at an airport mistaking him for a drug 
dealer merely because he was black. On tonight's rerun, moreover, Lester Barrie 
briefly refers to a roach-infested ghetto and the "slavery flashbacks" he has 
around his white friends, and blacks on welfare are part of J.B. Smoove's 
monologue. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet any social awareness is short-lived and myopic, for "faggot" jokes fly 
here with such abandon (echoing the earlier gay-insulting monologues of Eddie 
Murphy) that you need a chain saw to cut through the homophobia. 
</P>
<P>
 "That homosexual thing," as a comic named Royale labels it tonight, is 
generally exemplified on "Def Comedy Jam" by male stand-ups walking with 
mincing steps and affecting an exaggerated effeminate manner, to say nothing of 
simulating homosexual sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics of "South Central" faulted the premiere's opening joke about the 
black neighborhood's "smell of gunpowder in the morning," saying the humor was 
misplaced and created the wrong impression. Yet after joking tonight about 
having an altercation with a member of the audience during his last club gig, 
Royale displays a revolver shoved into the waistband of his trousers, adding, 
"We're not going to have any of that tonight, are we?" Although done with the 
same humorous intent as the "South Central" joke, the message to all races in 
the national audience -- about blacks resolving conflicts through violence -- 
is strong and unmistakable. 
</P>
<P>
 As it was on an earlier show when stand-up Michael Colyar described the 1992 
Los Angeles riots as an "uprising" that was long overdue. However, he urged 
blacks in Los Angeles to not destroy their own community but instead to aim 
their wrath at Simi Valley and "---- them up!" 
</P>
<P>
 It was a convoluted message that he delivered, though, in following his plea 
for black empowerment with a crude joke about a female body part. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it seems to reach out and touch the present, a book from the past 
applies here. Published in 1952, "Invisible Man" is Ralph Ellison's wise and 
perceptive account of a racist society whose controlling whites see blacks not 
as individuals but as a monolith whose components are a blur. Four decades 
later, ironically, "Def Comedy Jam" is using its contemporary black voice 
mostly to expand that obscurity by making sure that individuals are eclipsed by 
their sexual equipment. These aren't people, it seems to be telling America, 
these are lust machines. Compared with that, "South Central" offers little to 
complain about.

TONY. TONY? TONY!; SUDDENLY HIP CROONER, 67, WOOS THE MTV CROWD ON 'UNPLUGGED' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MILWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When word got out that Tony Bennett would be featured on MTV's popular concert 
series "Unplugged," the 67-year-old singer was quick to point out the obvious: 
"I've always been unplugged." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday night, near the end of the show's two-hour taping at the Sony 
Studios here, Bennett took the concept one step further by turning off the 
microphones. As he sang "Fly Me to the Moon," his voice hovered above the 
unamplified piano like a hummingbird before streaking to a finale that brought 
the crowd to its feet. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd think the Equator would have to move before MTV would devote an hour to 
a man who could be Beavis and Butt-head's grandfather. For "Unplugged," Bennett 
was joined for a song each by k.d. lang, Elvis Costello, the Lemonheads' Evan 
Dando and Dinosaur Jr.'s J Mascis. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of that overshadowed hearing Frank Sinatra's favorite singer 
introduce MTV's audience to material drawn from what he called "the great 
American songbook." An hour after the taping, Bennett pushed the envelope ever 
further by appearing on a syndicated radio talk show, "Modern Rock Live." 
</P>
<P>
 After the MTV performance, which is expected to be aired by next month, 
Costello said, "You can imagine the fear and trembling that comes when standing 
up to sing next to Tony Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
 "But make no mistake," the younger singer added, "this is not about kitsch but 
about a singer who's emotional and sincere, and that's the truest kind of 
style. He was modern to begin with, and the rest of us are just catching up." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the "Unplugged" duets, the best by far was by Bennett and lang, who traded 
verses on "Moonglow" and joined for especially sweet harmonies. Bennett and 
Costello (dressed for the occasion in a three-piece suit) made for a pleasingly 
odd couple exchanging lines on "They Can't Take That Away From Me." 
</P>
<P>
 Dando, sporting a new short haircut, sat on a stool and bashfully sketched out 
his half of "Solitude." Instead of singing, Mascis joined Bennett's trio to 
contribute a blues guitar solo on "St. James Infirmary" -- a song that he later 
said was new to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett's emergence as an alternative-rock icon is no accident. For the past 
15 years he's been managed by his son, Danny Bennett, 40, who remembers being 
awakened in the middle of the night by the sound of his father and Count Basie 
jamming in the basement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tony said he wanted to follow his passion and to feel uncompromised in his 
pursuit," says the younger Bennett, who used to play guitar in rock bands and 
who also manages a group called Tribe. Toward that end, he got his father 
booked not just on "The Tonight Show" but also on "SCTV," "The Simpsons" and 
David Letterman, and engineered a return to Columbia Records that reunited the 
singer with his voluminous catalogue.  
</P>
<P>
 Bennett's recording career built momentum with a four-CD retrospective 
collection in 1991 that set the table for two Grammy-winning albums in a row -- 
"Perfectly Frank," a selection of songs associated with Sinatra, and "Steppin' 
Out," which featured tunes introduced by Fred Astaire. 
</P>
<P>
 Both collections are songbooks in a style that recalls Ella Fitzgerald, and 
both have gone gold, more than doubling the sales of Bennett's other recent 
recordings. It should come as no surprise that Bennett's next album will be 
drawn from the "Unplugged" performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett couldn't be more tickled by this unusual turn of events. At the end of 
last year, making concert appearances with such alternative-rock bands as Belly 
and Smashing Pumpkins, he was shocked to be met with standing ovations and 
chants of "Tony, Tony, Tony." Then he won a Grammy in a category, traditional 
pop, that everybody figured belonged to Barbra Streisand's "Back to Broadway." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I'm accepted as a fashion of the day," says Bennett, who cut his first 
record in 1952, "and I'm still singing my Cole Porter songs." 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after Bennett cut his signature hit, "I Left My Heart in San 
Francisco," the Beatles and Bob Dylan redefined popular music by making it all 
but essential for singers to write their own songs. Bennett asked Count Basie 
for advice. Recalls Bennett: "He said, 'Why change an apple?' " So he didn't, 
bolstered by his conviction that "when a songwriter sings his own songs it can 
be so much more mediocre than when a singer like Lena Horne knocks it out of 
the ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, Bennett would record four songs in 3 1/2 hours. The two-day 
session for "Steppin' Out" produced 25 songs. Producer David Kahne, who's 
crafted hits for the Bangles and is currently recording Shawn Colvin, was 
exhilarated by sessions in which his primary task was to focus maximum 
attention on Bennett's singular voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "On most rock recordings," Kahne says, "you punch in vocal overdubs to get a 
particular spin on a performance. With Tony, his tone is so strong that you get 
all the dynamics out of his voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tony's taught a lot of people about the sheer physicality of singing. With 
highly amplified music, you lose the fact that people create a lot of tone with 
their body and can use their voice to create all kinds of dynamics. When Tony's 
singing in a room, you can literally feel the air moving." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett says his heroes are people such as Bing Crosby, Duke Ellington and 
Pablo Picasso -- "artists who lived long and worked up to the day they died." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett is happy to follow their lead. The singer is also an accomplished 
painter who takes out his brushes every day, just as he devotes at least 20 
minutes to vocal scales. For Bennett, this is not work but the rejuvenating 
disciplines of a life that's still in full swing. And the payoffs are grand. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anything," he says, "I have more control than ever over my voice, because 
I know how to feel more, and because I have wisdom."

<P>
A FEW CHOICE WORDS FROM SHELLEY BERMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE CHRISTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nobody ever drew more of a bum rap from show-biz history than Shelley Berman. 
</P>
<P>
 When he first came up during the mid-to-late '50s, he was still too young for 
the Maniacal-but-Established category, which embraced people like Red Skelton, 
who once climbed a tree outside his Bel-Air home and waved a pistol at anyone 
approaching, and Sid Caesar, who once dangled Mel Brooks by his ankles outside 
a 10th-story window. 
</P>
<P>
 And later he was too old for the generation of rockers and other touring 
talents who, owing to the combustible mix of drugs, extreme youth and overnight 
success, routinely trashed entire hotel suites (Berman's wrath, quaint in 
comparison, was restricted to tossing unneeded bath soap into the wastepaper 
basket and then complaining to management). 
</P>
<P>
 He was part of a new wave of comedians -- Mike Nichols and Elaine May, Mort 
Sahl and Lenny Bruce among them -- who were embarking on an all-new course of 
social commentary. Their material didn't simply amuse and divert; it held up a 
mirror; it was dark and edgy and a little dangerous. And when Berman was seen 
angrily ripping a telephone off a wall in a famous 1963 documentary, people 
realized something about the new comics that they hadn't seen in the old 
reliables like Jack Benny and George Burns: They weren't just telling truths 
about pain and embarrassment and a kind of universal post-war confusion -- they 
were implicated in those truths. The tummler had chilled the party. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish to hell we could all be comfortable working together in this world," 
Berman would say in an interview 20 years later, "but I can't be comfortable." 
Berman was an angry man. Anger only works in show business if you're very young 
or very dead, or if you can send the surreptitious signal to your interviewer 
or the viewing public that underneath it all you're a sweet guy and it's really 
an act. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman will work two one-man shows Sunday at North Hollywood's Academy Plaza 
Theatre, a plush state-of-the-art venue that seats nearly 600 (the theater is 
now home for the "Show of the Month" celebrity series, of which Berman is a 
part). 
</P>
<P>
 He'll perform a couple of his telephone routines, two of his classic sketches 
-- the painfully evocative "Insomnia" and the poignant routine about a Jewish 
father reluctant to surrender his son to the sure pain of an acting career in 
the big city -- and perhaps one segment about a forgetful man calling his 
doctor in a panic. 
</P>
<P>
 " You can call them classic. Won't the audience just think they're old?" 
Berman said, challenging his interviewer. At 68, he still likes to stir the 
waters. But clearly the plaintive combativeness of old has at last been banked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't dislike being a comedian," he says. "I love it. But people tend to 
forget that I started out (at the Goodman Theater) as an actor. The most 
comforting thing for me is to be working in an ensemble of good actors in a 
well-written play, or even a medium play. I was happy putting on age makeup and 
leaving off my rug to play a movie mogul in 'L.A. Law.' You don't mind going 
broke, just so long as you can do what you're meant to do." 
</P>
<P>
 And Berman has done well as an actor, playing around the country through the 
years in musicals such as "Fiddler on the Roof," "The Rothschilds," the 
national company of "Two by Two," and "La Cage aux Folles." He's done a lot of 
Neil Simon. He was critically well-received in the Chicago (his theatrical home 
base) production of Jeff Sweet's "The Value of Names," and was a 1990 Joseph 
Jefferson Award nominee, also in Chicago, for his role in "I'm Not Rappaport." 
Last year he played in "Love, Dreams and Lost Uncles" at the Court Theater in 
Hollywood. There have been film parts and the usual run of guest star TV shots 
available to "names" in the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman's success as a comedian was, however, spectacular. Three gold records. 
A Grammy. Carnegie Hall. It's been his relationship with the public as a person 
who takes emotional risks that has bedeviled his career. In the end, people 
like their comics cuddly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something has happened to stand-up comedy. It's set-up and punch that begins 
'Didja ever . . .?' or 'I don't know about you, but my mother . . .' People 
laugh at the punch line. They have a good time. But it has nothing to do with 
the material. It'd be easy to blame the comedians, or even the audience, but I 
don't think that's the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has happened, I think, is that the heirs of the tradition of outspoken 
comedy have adopted the trappings -- the raunch, the language, the 
outrageousness -- without understanding their content. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every comedian articulates his time. An unpopular war and a Supreme Court 
decision that said there's no such thing as separate but equal -- which led to 
no action -- created a climate of deep skepticism and anger. Then you had a 
George Carlin to come along and examine language, and a Richard Pryor to come 
along to show the edge of racism. And Steve Martin and Robin Williams the young 
to play up the nonsense of the period. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're not addressing is the fears of our time, the new self-censorship, 
the damning of the intellectual. I believe that comedy is still found in the 
real world, like the fear of carjacking or being killed. I'm worried that we've 
given up the awareness of the world around us." 
</P>
<P>
 These are some of the concerns he'll discuss. Not the career. Not anymore. 
He's still ahead of the curve. 
</P>
<P>

GERMANY DEPORTS 2 NEO-NAZI KFI-RADIO GUESTS; BROADCASTING: HOST BILL HANDEL HAD 
SCHEDULED THE SKINHEADS TO SPEAK AT A HOLOCAUST PROGRAM IN MUNICH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pair of American neo-Nazis accompanying KFI morning personality Bill Handel 
to Germany earlier this week were refused entry and deported upon arrival in 
Munich, where Handel broadcast his morning show about the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 Handel and other station officials arrived in Munich Tuesday and went on to 
broadcast in Poland today from Auschwitz, where Handel's grandparents were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
 John Metzger and Tony McAleer, representatives of the Fallbrook-based White 
Aryan Resistance organization, were supposed to have been guests on Handel's 
show in Munich Wednesday and at Auschwitz, but were detained and sent back to 
the United States just after the group landed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Metzger, 26, has been involved in many neo-Nazi activities -- including white 
supremacist rallies and hate crimes -- in the United States. In 1991, a 
Portland jury ruled that he and his father Tom Metzger had incited the beating 
death of an Ethiopian student. In a civil suit after the fatal beating, both 
Metzgers were ordered to pay $12.5 million to the student's family. 
</P>
<P>
 After receiving word from the German government, officials at the German 
consulate in Los Angeles explained the deportation as being in the public 
interest of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Metzger is a well-known figure all over the world and the entry of Mr. 
Metzger was against the public interest of Germany because he was known as a 
right-wing political activist and suspected of (conducting) undesirable 
political activity in Germany," said Uwe Petry, German consul for press 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is stipulated by our laws that whenever such a public interest can be 
specified, people can be denied entry. Mr. Metzger was known to German 
authorities and there are records of him on different levels, including secret 
agency information." 
</P>
<P>
 Petry did not have any details on McAleer, a Vancouver resident. The two 
neo-Nazis were sent back to the U.S. on a plane to Chicago, after being 
detained in Munich for four hours.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time Metzger has been refused entry into a foreign 
country. Both he and his father were deported upon entering Canada in 1992 
where they planned to speak at a Canadian white supremacists rally. Canadian 
immigration officials called them "a danger to the public."  
</P>
<P>
 KFI's Handel had devoted the entire week to discussion of the Holocaust, with 
two planned European broadcasts, culminating in this morning's emotional show 
from the memorial at Nazi Germany's Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
 KFI program director David Hall said Thursday that he had no idea the two 
skinheads would be barred from entering Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like out of a spy novel," Hall said. "(Metzger) never told us he 
didn't think he'd get in, but I have the impression he was not surprised by 
this. We were surprised. We certainly didn't expect this. We don't know Mr. 
Metzger. Except for this one project we really don't have anything to do with 
him. I guess there's a lot about him that we really don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Reached at his Fallbrook home Thursday, Metzger said he had alerted station 
officials to his problems getting into Canada, but was assured that he had 
received clearance to go to Germany. He also said the station lost about $5,000 
for his and McAleer's plane fare. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little upset at some of the management at KFI insinuating that the 
blame has been shifted onto me and Mr. McAleer," said Metzger who hosts a cable 
access show called "Race and Reason," which is seen in 10 states. 
</P>
<P>
 Metzger denied that he had any political activities planned in Germany, but 
said that a current highly publicized German court case in which skinheads are 
charged with fire bombing foreign students made their entry "sensitive." 
</P>
<P>
 "I can understand they wouldn't want to inflame the political situation at the 
moment," Metzger said. "But that's not to let them off the hook. We were just 
going to broadcast. We weren't going to go around and raise hell. I just wanted 
to do the radio show and go to Poland. If I wanted to go to Germany again I'm 
fairly confident that with our network I could be smuggled in through another 
country. I'm sure that's still an option, but not at the moment." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the station was blasted Thursday by the B'nai B'rith 
Anti-Defamation League for "providing a platform to an avowed hater." 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles-based KFI radio's attempt to facilitate a meeting between German 
racists and an American hatemonger is merely the latest effort by the station 
to exploit hate for ratings," said David Lehrer, regional director of the ADL. 
</P>
<P>
 Lehrer urged KFI to "stop providing bigots with opportunities to magnify their 
significance."

A TWIST ON THE FAB FOUR THAT'S OFF THE BEATEN PATH; MOVIES: THE 'BACKBEAT' AD 
MAKES REFERENCES TO THE BAND, BUT THE FILM IS REALLY ABOUT LIFE BEFORE LENNON 
AND MCCARTNEY WROTE TOGETHER, BEFORE RINGO, AND BEFORE BEATLEMANIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They look like the Beatles (kind of). They dress like them. And the "BackBeat" 
logo resembles the real band's typeface. What's more, this movie is set in the 
Hamburg era of the Fab Four -- when they were five and included bassist Stuart 
Sutcliffe and drummer Pete Best not Ringo Starr. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, oddly, references to the Beatles in the movie's promotional campaign 
could best be described as oblique. The black-and-white photos of black 
leather-jacketed musicians. The Union Jack. And the one-line slogan: "5 guys, 4 
legends, 3 lovers, 2 friends, 1 band." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who pay attention to feature stories about "BackBeat" will learn of the 
connection. Some movie ads feature critics' quotes that mention the Beatles. 
Otherwise, reference by the filmmakers to the Beatles in this context is 
verboten.  
</P>
<P>
 "Beatles" is a trademark and as such, cannot be used without express 
permission from the owners, which the British filmmakers decided wasn't worth 
the time, trouble (and presumably expense) of getting, they were advised by 
attorneys for Polygram Pictures in Britain and for U.S. distributors Gramercy 
Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 As it was, one of the movie's producers, Finola Dwyer, said "out of courtesy," 
copies of the script were sent to Paul McCartney and George Harrison before 
filming for their comments -- and only Harrison responded. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Through his intermediaries, Dwyer recalled that "he didn't want to be 
involved, but wished us good luck anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Beatles are world famous and, by legal definition, public figures, 
the filmmakers say they were comfortable taking free license creatively with 
their version of the band's vainglorious beginnings in and around Hamburg's 
avant-garde club scene circa 1960-61. (Also, as precedent, other Beatle-themed 
movies have been made, notably "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" and "The Hours and 
Times.") 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Dwyer said, "BackBeat" is really less about John, Paul, George, Stu 
and Pete than it is about Lennon's intensely close friendship with best friend 
Sutcliffe and the confusion and dissension within the group when Sutcliffe 
decided he'd rather paint and hang out with his German lover, Astrid Kirchherr, 
a photographer, than play bass and do covers of other musicians' songs. This 
slice of life is pre-Beatlemania and before the Lennon and McCartney 
songwriting collaboration. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirchherr also figures prominently in the film's acknowledgments, as do 
members of Sutcliffe's family. It was they who director and co-screenwriter 
Iain Softley met with when he began to track the story behind the story of 
Kirchherr's now-legendary black-and-white stills of the teen-age Liverpudlians. 
 
</P>
<P>
 No reference to anything Beatles in the end crawl, either. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even the music of "BackBeat" is either original, and scored by Don Was, or is 
a cover of an oldie such as "Please Mr. Postman" or "Twist and Shout," 
performed by what is best described as an alternative rock supergroup assembled 
by Was. 
</P>
<P>
 In the "BackBeat" band are Nirvana's Dave Grohl (drums), R.E.M.'s Mike Mills 
(bass and backing vocals) and Soul Asylum's Dave Pirner (McCartney's vocals), 
among others. A cross-promotion is under way with Virgin Records, which is 
releasing the soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite appearances and Dwyer's argument "that the (involvement of the) 
Beatles wasn't crucial to the film working," it did seem to make the 
co-producer happy that Lennon's first wife, Cynthia Lennon, and their son, 
Julian, attended the recent premiere for 800 of "BackBeat" in London earlier 
this month and said they "loved it." 
</P>
<P>
 Others in the audience included rockers Bob Geldof and George Michael, actor 
Bob Hoskins and director Ridley Scott. The post-premiere party was held at the 
Waldorf Hotel, where the gritty atmosphere of German bars was re-created. 
</P>
<P>
 "BackBeat" opens today in Los Angeles and New York in limited release and will 
go into a slow rollout to other major cities a week later.  
</P>
<P>
 If "BackBeat"-mania develops, it may go wider still.

MINING PAST FOR THE FUTURE; FORMER STRAY CAT BRIAN SETZER HITS A CHORD IN '80S 
BY PUTTING NEW TWIST ON ROCKABILLY, AND HOPES TO DO SAME WITH BIG-BAND SWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It would seem that Brian Setzer was born in the wrong era. 
</P>
<P>
 The former front man of rockabilly revivalists the Stray Cats lately has been 
mining even deeper into America's musical past with the 17-piece Brian Setzer 
Orchestra, which is introducing big-band swing to a new generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Setzer, who performs to a sold-out crowd tonight at the Coach House, confesses 
that leading a big band has been a long-time dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always seem to go back and find this great music that's not been done, or 
not been done (the way I hear it)," he said in a recent phone interview from 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like a lot of new music too, but I always seem to parallel it with the 
older stuff. Rockabilly, I paralleled with punk. I thought it had that power 
and drive. This, of course, is a whole different thing, but it occurred to me 
what a great idea it would be to lead a big band with an electric guitar and a 
rock foundation. . . . People are ready for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Setzer, 34, grew up on New York's Long Island, with access to the eclectic 
variety of live music offered up nightly in New York City. Big-band jazz was a 
part of that scene that stayed with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a kid, I'd spend one night going to the Village Vanguard to catch 
the Gil Evans Band, and the next night going to CBGB's to see (rock band) 
Television," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, a lot of my guitar teachers were jazz players," he said. "I guess 
that's where this all started, but one way or another, I would have discovered 
it eventually, because it's such great music." 
</P>
<P>
 The Setzer orchestra's new album (released by Hollywood Records) runs the 
stylistic gamut from Wynonie Harris' jump blues classic, "Sittin' On It All The 
Time," to the jazz standards "Route 66" and "Nightingale Sang in Berkeley 
Square" to four swinging originals, including the finger-popping, Bobby 
Darin-esque "Lady Luck." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I listen to this record, I really think I pulled off something that's 
unique," Setzer said. "At the very least, I led a big band with a guitar. I 
like the way it sounds. It's really clean." 
</P>
<P>
 Setzer could also be leading the way to another roots-music explosion, much as 
the Stray Cats had done a dozen years earlier when the hits "Stray Cat Strut" 
and "Rock This Town" hit the top of the charts. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of performers are playing their own versions of revitalized jump 
blues and swing: Buster Poindexter has completed his third album in the genre, 
Canadian singer-guitarist Colin James has just put out one for Virgin Records 
and other lesser-known acts have releases on various indie labels. 
</P>
<P>
 The Derby, a popular club in Hollywood, books jump, swing and jazz 
exclusively, and has been the subject of profiles on CNN and a slew of 
newspaper and magazine articles. 
</P>
<P>
 But due to the critical and popular backlash against the overnight success of 
the Stray Cats, Setzer's not sure if a full-scale revival is such a healthy 
thing for big-band music. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost kind of dread that happening, because it stung -- and it still 
stings -- that rockabilly became a trend and a fashion and a fad, and then 
everybody hates it and it's over with," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions jumped on the rockabilly bandwagon in the early '80s, then turned on 
the Stray Cats, grumbling that Setzer, bassist Lee Rocker and drummer Slim Jim 
Phantom had become rockabilly caricatures. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, so the Stray Cats had a lot of hair, and we had tattoos and earrings, but 
that's the way I (expletive) like to look!" Setzer said. "I don't think it 
would have changed anything if we had been less flamboyant. Things go under -- 
that's the natural course of things in this business, and that's the part I 
don't like." 
</P>
<P>
 While Setzer said he doesn't rule out a Stray Cats reunion, he is happy with 
the more adult-oriented music he's making -- for now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely see a couple more records in this," he said. "I can say 
absolutely at least one more, because I'm already starting to get ideas. But do 
I want to do this the rest of my life? All I know is that I want to play guitar 
for the rest of my life. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I look at people's faces out there in the front tables at the shows, see 
their expressions and say, 'Yeah! I'm onto something again.' " 
</P>

COUNCIL OKS $200,000 FOR POND SCULPTURE; ART: THE UNTITLED WORK OF GLASS AND 
TILE FOR ARENA'S PLAZA IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN SEPTEMBER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The City Council has approved $200,000 for a piece of sculpture on the plaza 
outside the Pond in Anaheim. The untitled work by Richard Turner of Orange and 
Ann Preston and Michael Davis, both of Los Angeles, is in the preliminary 
design stage and is expected to be finished by early September. 
</P>
<P>
 The piece is to consist of a 20-foot-high central component -- a slender, 
abstract fiberglass form on a thick glass column -- surrounded by a sloping 
plane of glass or tile mosaic. Lights concealed in the top of the column are to 
illuminate the sculpture so that it will appear to float. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the artists' proposal, the fiberglass form -- which will resemble 
a Rorschach test ink blot in the round -- is meant to suggest such images as an 
athlete in motion and the frozen silhouette of a stream of bubbling water. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a bit of perceptual trickery (anamorphosis) known to Renaissance 
artists, the artists plan to circle the base of the column with distorted 
mosaic images of Greek athletes that will be properly readable to viewers only 
as reflections on the shiny surface of the column. An outer ring of tiles will 
depict "the dance of the sea nymphs." Such classical references are 
"reminiscent of the antique traditions of the arena and the spectacle of mass 
entertainment," according to the artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounding the sculpture, a band of colored concrete will contain more shapes 
derived from ink blots as well as granite medallions etched with "perceptual 
puzzles" in keeping with interactive theme of the piece, which is meant to 
mirror "the dynamic of the spectator-event relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 The artists were selected by the City Council and the Citizen's Art Advisory 
Committee in September. The piece, to be located on the plaza's southeast 
corner, will be the second component of the arena's art plan, initiated in June 
with Nam June Paik's "Video Arch."

 Summer movies -- Wednesday's article about independent film companies' summer 
releases misstated the release date for the 1990 AIDS drama "Longtime 
Companion"; it was Memorial Day weekend, not in August. The date of the Samuel 
Goldwyn Co. release was notable, as it challenged the longstanding notion that 
only major, commercial films could be launched successfully on the weekend that 
traditionally marks the beginning of the lucrative summer movie season.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'COPS' A SUBVERSIVE FAMILY COMEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the surface "Cops and Robbersons" is the broad-appeal family comedy it 
presents itself to be, but its subtext is gratifyingly another matter. Its 
setting is a tract of unrelenting snug blandness, and a husband and father, 
Norman Robberson (Chevy Chase), who owns one of the homes, works at an office 
of equal uniformity. No one seems very happy or connected in the Robberson 
household, but its dominant figure, Norman's wife, Helen (Dianne Wiest), 
declares with finality that "Everything is fine!" 
</P>
<P>
 Seemingly, things are soon to get spectacularly better when Jack Palance's 
crusty veteran cop Jake Stone uses the Robberson house to stake out their new 
next-door neighbor (Robert Davi), an especially lethal double-crosser dealing 
in counterfeit money. Palance's rookie partner Tony (David Barry Gray) finds 
the attraction between him and the Robbersons' high school student daughter 
(Fay Masterson) mutual, and the two young Robberson sons (Jason James Richter, 
Miko Hughes) are as in awe of Jake as their parents are. 
</P>
<P>
 It so happens that Norman has always wanted to be a cop, at least in his 
fantasies, and is such a TV cop show fanatic that when he returns a "Police 
Woman" tape to a video store, he feels compelled to point out that 11 seconds 
are missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, Norman feels that his opportunity to be a hero has arrived at last, 
but he's such a naive klutz that he very nearly destroys Jake's operation at 
the start. (Never mind that he actually uncovered some pertinent information.) 
In essence, what writer Bernie Somers, in an exceptional first-produced 
screenplay, reveals is that the arrival of Jake not only underlines Norman's 
lack of respect within his own family, but also worsens it. With his satirical 
eye for the absurdities of American middle-class life and his special awareness 
of competition, so much a part of the American character, director Michael 
Ritchie is just the man to bring out the darkest side of Somers' script with 
much compassionate humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, Ritchie has erased from Chase that easy superciliousness that can 
drive you crazy if you're not one of Chase's die-hard fans. Chase consistently 
underplays, and gains immeasurably from doing so. His Norman longs for 
recognition but never grovels for it, although he may pursue it recklessly. He 
is a nice, decent guy who deserves better from his family, who loves him but 
doesn't pay much attention to him, especially his children. He's an office 
worker who has consciously or otherwise deferred running the family and the 
home to his wife. Well-meaning, she has taken on the role with missionary, 
perfectionist zeal. Helen can be a nit-picker, but Wiest shows us that she's 
really a good woman who's fundamentally devoted to her husband as well as her 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 So often cast as the villain throughout his long career, Palance has emerged 
in recent years as a hilarious comedian, starting with "Bagdad Cafe" and his 
Oscar-winning turn in "City Slickers." Jake may have a heart of gold lurking 
behind his tough-guy stance, but Palance plays his predicament in holding the 
Robberson family at bay while doing his job of surveillance with a comic 
gruffness that forestalls undue sentimentality. Jake is a showy, funny role and 
Palance really runs with it. So does Davi with his bad guy, who can be 
amusingly, disarmingly likable. The film's young actors provide winning support 
for the film's top-lined veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameraman Gerry Fisher has brought to "Cops and Robbersons" a deceptively 
bright, shiny look that's just right to set off the film's darker 
undercurrents. The great thing is that the film doesn't cop out at the finish: 
It's Helen, after all, who keeps her cool in a crisis, and when finally Norman 
wins his family's attention and concern, it's a display of compassion and 
congratulations for heroics attempted rather than accomplished. There's a tinge 
of sadness amid the laughter in this surprisingly subversive family comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG for mild violence, language and some comic nudity. Times 
guidelines: It is actually solid, surprisingly thought-provoking family fare, 
though it does include flashes of bare buttocks.
