 CALABASAS CUP: Forget about the action at the Rose Bowl. What happened at the 
Pellegrini household in Calabasas, where husband Ronaldo and wife Mercedes 
squared off for World Cup bragging rights? Well, Mercedes, who was born in 
Brazil got the last laugh this time. . . . And just a few hours after the 
Brazilian victory, "I told him now we have to wait four more years to beat 
Italy," she said.

 RESCUE MISSION: For six months, Joel Greenberg, who owns a photography studio 
at the quake-damaged Laurel Plaza in North Hollywood, had followed orders and 
stayed away. But on Monday, enough was enough. He took out thousands of 
portraits and negatives from his store (B1). . . . It's probably safe to say 
that his customers who filled out the "rush" orders found in the studio gave up 
long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 UPDATE: Roya Saberzadeh (above) has a right to be depressed. Who wouldn't be? 
She owns Rochie's Greek Row in Northridge, and like some other stores, business 
has been a big bust since the quake. So bad, in fact, she's had to borrow from 
dad. "I'm going to owe him into the next lifetime," she said. . . . Meanwhile, 
for others, business is booming. See Valley Business, Page 12. 
</P>
<P>
 BUYER'S MARKET: In June, it was the same old story with Valley home sales. On 
the one hand, the news was encouraging as more homes closed escrow -- in fact, 
it was close to the best showing in five years. . . . But, at the same time, 
prices went down yet again. This time, the median price slipped 14% from June, 
1993. See Valley Business, Page 5. 
</P>
<P>
 LOVE CONNECTION: It was love at first sight, and it's been love ever since for 
Allan and Rene Gottlieb who, on Sunday, celebrated 50 years together. The 
Calabasas couple met on a dance floor in England during the war (B3). . . . 
Allan was smitten by her English accent and pea green stockings. Rene says her 
accent was genuine, but the stockings were originally khaki, turning to pea 
green accidentally after too many washings. Michael Arkush

 Snyder Inks CBS Deal: It looks as if CNBC host Tom Snyder will indeed host a 
late-night talk show for CBS following David Letterman's "Late Show." Despite 
previous public statements that he would stay with cable's CNBC, Snyder has 
signed "an agreement in principle with CBS," sources confirmed Monday. Plans 
call for Snyder, the choice of both Letterman and his producers to fill the 
late-late slot, to host the show from Los Angeles. Snyder's CNBC contract runs 
until the end of December, and sources said it still is not known if the cable 
channel would let Snyder out of his contract early. CBS declined comment on the 
negotiations.

 Returning to Space: "Lost in Space" actress June Lockhart got an 
out-of-this-world feeling on Monday while talking to astronauts on the Columbia 
space shuttle. "I'm not lost in space anymore . . . I'm right here in Mission 
Control!" Lockhart said, squealing in delight and thrusting her arms into the 
air as she conversed with Shuttle Cmdr. Robert Cabana. Lockhart, 69, visited 
Mission Control in Houston after participating in a panel discussion marking 
the 25th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing. She played the mother of a 
space-wandering family in the 1960s TV series. POP/ROCK

"The Pink Panther" at a memorial service for the late composer on Sunday that 
was attended by 300 at UCLA's Schoenberg Hall. Among those paying tribute to 
Mancini, who died on June 14 of cancer, were composers David Raksin and Irwin 
Kostal, and lyricists Arthur Hamilton and Alan Bergman. The event also included 
a film tribute to Mancini from the American Society of Composers, Authors and

SCREENING ROOM; 'COMING OUT' DOCUMENTS WWII GAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arthur Dong's informative, consciousness-raising "Coming Out Under Fire" (at 
the Nuart Thursday through July 27) documents the experiences of nine gay and 
lesbian World War II veterans amid a plethora of archival footage and framed 
within the context of the recent and ongoing debate over gays in the military. 
</P>
<P>
 All the men and women state that they had no problems getting along with 
straights, many of whom assumed their sexual orientation and were not upset by 
it, but that they lived in constant fear of being denounced and subjected to 
the Draconian anti-gay regulations established early in the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Most left the service with well-earned honorable discharges, but several were 
not so fortunate, bearing scars from those experiences to this day. Yet if a 
gay male didn't lie to get into the service, the alternative was to be sent 
home bearing the stigma of "sexual pervert." 
</P>
<P>
 Dong, who based his film on Allan Berube's 1990 book of the same name, makes 
clear that World War II was the first time gays and lesbians were brought 
together in large numbers; this breaking down of isolation laid the foundation 
for the eventual gay liberation movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Dong's film is only 87 minutes long, he might well have interviewed 
straight World War II veterans as to their attitudes toward gays and lesbians 
in the ranks and also underlined the fact that ongoing discriminatory policies 
in the military provide impetus for other kinds of anti-gay legislation.

 To Austin for Music: In a thoroughly captivating, laid-back way Tara 
Veneruso's "Janis Joplin Slept Here" (presented Thursday by EZTV at RESOLUTION 
Gallery, 6518 Hollywood Blvd.) chronicles the last three decades or so in the 
amazingly vibrant, varied and enduring music scene of Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 In the course of interviewing, in a mere two hours, 74 musicians, artists' 
managers, club owners, DJs, critics and even a simpatico retired cop, Veneruso 
reminds us of what a major music capital Austin has long been, cradle of 
everything from blues to punk rock to current alternative music. 
</P>
<P>
 "Janis Joplin Slept Here" makes you wish you had been to local landmark clubs, 
past and present, where you could enjoy everyone from Muddy Waters, the Sex 
Pistols, Johnny Winter, Bruce Springsteen ("when he was just a long name"), 
Stevie Ray Vaughn to Joplin herself -- not to mention scores more. Joplin was 
just one of numerous Texas performers who would migrate to San Francisco in the 
late '60s; at that time Austin also produced several key masters of psychedelic 
poster art.

 Malcolm X Documentary: "Brother Minister: The Assassination of Malcolm X" (at 
the Sunset 5 at noon only for one week starting Friday) is a powder keg of a 
documentary directed by Jack Baxter, a former private investigator, who 
co-produced and co-wrote the film with Jefri Aalmuhammed, a Black Muslim who 
was a consultant on Spike Lee's "Malcolm X." 
</P>
<P>
 In a series of interviews with Malcolm X's colleagues, coupled with much 
potent and often rare archival materials, the filmmakers raise many unanswered 
questions surrounding the assassination of Malcolm X in February, 1965, in 
Harlem's Audubon Ballroom, where the charismatic Black Muslim leader, who had 
broken from Elijah Muhammad and his Nation of Islam, was to speak to followers 
of his own Organization of Afro-American Unity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brother Minister" brings considerable clarity to an exceedingly complex, 
highly charged event, pointing a lot of fingers along the way and suggesting 
that the death of the ever-evolving Malcolm was a tragic loss to the ranks of 
African American leaders. At the very least, the film makes a strong case for a 
congressional investigation into Malcolm's assassination.

TV REVIEW; 'PASSIN": A ROMANTIC LOOK AT THE PANTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Black Panther Party, whose presence has been felt far longer than the 
organization's actual active life, tends to stir up deep, almost irrational 
passions in America's far political wings. While both sides have railed for and 
against the Panthers, a reasoned, objective history of the group's rise and 
fall has yet to be written. And we're no closer to the unvarnished truth with 
Peter Miller's and John Valadez's "Passin' It On," on PBS' "P.O.V." series 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, "Passin' It On" appears to be the left's latest media effort to rile 
up the right. Miller's and Valadez's film is a model of agit-prop, and the 
right-wing Center for the Study of Popular Culture has fired back, labeling the 
film a "promotional" piece for the film's subject and New York Panther 
organizer, Dhoruba Bin Wahad. 
</P>
<P>
 It is indeed that, and Miller and Valadez indeed show (sometimes laboriously) 
that Wahad was the likely object of a rushed police attempt to nail the leading 
Panther spokespersons on less-than-solid evidence of conspiracy to murder. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That a New York jury acquitted the so-called "Panther 21" in a 1971 conspiracy 
trial, and that the courts eventually overturned Wahad's conviction (for the 
murder of two New York City police officers) bolsters this film's claims that 
the Panthers were unjustly targeted for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Passin' It On" not only obviously turns Wahad into a martyr figure, it 
also romanticizes the Panthers. Panther veteran Jamal Joseph explains that the 
group provided free meals and health care along with political education for 
ghetto youth. In fact, the Panthers, as the angry children of a civil rights 
movement devastated by the Martin Luther King Jr. assassination, adapted Mao 
Zedong's tactics of community organizing and recruitment for the eventual armed 
struggle -- but you won't hear that here. "Passin' It On" also fails to explore 
the group's ethic of "self-defense," which justified armed struggle against 
what was perceived to be the occupying force of the police in the ghetto. In 
1994, the ethic echoes the pleas of a National Rifle Assn. supporter or 
neo-Nazi militias who also claim they are victims of government spies and 
counterintelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Passin' It On" airs at 10 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28.

AL MARTINEZ: DAYS OF DRUMS AND TAMBOURINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I had an epiphany the other day. I was lying on the beach in Malibu trying to 
avoid listening to the calamity around me when I realized that there's too 
damned much noise in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a realization born in bedlam. Not far away, young men were beating 
bongo drums. On the other side, kids were banging tambourines. To my rear, 
tone-deaf teen-agers were playing loud rock music on a car stereo. For a 
terrible moment, I wished hammers on their empty heads. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when I had the epiphany. Like Jesus suddenly realizing that water is no 
substitute for burgundy, it struck me that noise is making us crazy, and the 
madness is making us violent. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not that enthusiastic about the beach in the first place. Lying in the 
sun makes me feel like a spit-broiled rump roast. I went at the behest of my 
friends Nicole, Travis and Shana, all under 10, who like to play in the surf 
and punch each other in the stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's your vacation," my wife, Cinelli, said. "Have fun." 
</P>
<P>
 "God never intended me to have fun," I said. "That's why he made me a 
journalist." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, go anyhow. Maybe the Fuji Film blimp will crash in the surf. You can 
watch the sharks eat the crew." 
</P>
<P>
 I've been reading Dennis McDougal's startling new book, "In the Best of 
Families," about rape and murder among macrobiotic vegetarians, and figured the 
ocean front at least would allow me a moment to enjoy the rest of it. It's my 
kind of story. The Brady Bunch in Hell. 
</P>
<P>
 But the pandemonium around me was so intense, all I could do was lie there and 
ponder noise-induced madness. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I heard once that certain fish produce unpleasant sounds by grinding their 
bones together and expelling the noise through their swim bladders. This may 
seem like the beginning of a Howard Stern joke, but I'm not making it up. The 
resultant discord confuses the fish's enemies and causes them to fight each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked a psychologist friend, an unfrocked Jesuit with an unreasonable fear 
of seeing his name in print, if it is possible that noise is behind the general 
disorientation of L.A.'s population, the reason we are doing so much killing 
and maiming.  
</P>
<P>
 He said excessive noise has been a factor in certain character disorders and 
could probably be applied on a mass scale. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you're talking about is confusion," he said. "It goes along with noise. 
We are confused and disoriented by pandemonium based on the unreal events 
around us. Could that lead to violence? Sure. Both noise and violence are 
disruptions. Why, are you hearing voices in your head?" 
</P>
<P>
 No, I'm hearing drums and tambourines, and the more I think about them, the 
more I realize they're a metaphor for the madness that surrounds us. And their 
intensity has increased in the past few weeks. It's due to the O.J. Saga. 
</P>
<P>
 The unreality of one of America's sports heroes being charged with the murder 
of two people has created a clamor almost unparalleled in L.A. The vision of 
Simpson's hangdog expression will be a logo for this generation of jocks for a 
long time to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Being away from the fray gave me better perspective on just how we reacted to 
it. The preliminary hearing was reality-soap of the lowest order -- every sad 
and chilling word. Television banged the tambourines. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If violence is a disruption, we're growing accustomed to it. A woman named 
Lisa Zuckerman tells me about having lunch at a restaurant in Van Nuys. As she 
stared out a window, sirens split the air, a car crashed out of range and two 
policemen shot into view. They tackled a man running from them, and, after a 
furious fight, handcuffed him at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 The encounter was bloody and violent. "But you know," she said, "it didn't 
bother me at all. I've seen so much of that in the movies and on television, I 
was used to it. It was like watching a show." 
</P>
<P>
 Even kid films bang drums of violence. I took Nicole, Shana and Travis to see 
"Baby's Day Out." I wish I hadn't. Writer-producer John Hughes makes money by 
combining children and mayhem on the big screen. Setting someone's crotch afire 
is his idea of humor for pre-pubescents. The drumbeat is deafening. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as Forrest Gump says, that's all I have to say about that. I stayed at 
the beach long enough for the guys with the bongos to leave, for the kids with 
the tambourines to go home and for the owner of the car stereo to drive off. It 
was just me and my kids and a wisp of fog drifting down from the north. 
</P>
<P>
 Serenity to die for.

THE NUMBERS TELL A STORY; QUAKE STATISTICS ARE LIKE NOTHING ANYONE HAS EVER 
SEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sheer magnitude of the Northridge quake's impact demands an extensive 
review of the now six-month-old recovery effort by federal, state and local 
officials. Simply put, there is nothing in the recent memory of the nation that 
compares with the January temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 These are not the self-serving impressions of the hometown newspaper. The 
facts come from the Clinton Administration, which said last month that the 
effect of the Northridge quake was bigger than the combined impacts of the 
Midwest floods, Hurricane Andrew, the Loma Prieta earthquake and South 
Carolina's Hurricane Hugo. Since then, the Northridge numbers have continued to 
grow -- and so the growing concern. 
</P>
<P>
 It is typical after a major disaster, for example, for there to be a huge gap 
between the number of loan applications issued and the usually far lower number 
actually filled out and turned in. But, again, it is the magnitude of the 
Northridge numbers that beg questions: 497,225 applications issued, 197,867 
actually filed. In terms of businesses alone, there were 135,049 applications 
handed out and just 43,657 filed. 
</P>
<P>
 The gap is just too large, and the number of employers and employees too 
great, to avoid an investigation of why so few were turned in. Was the 
paperwork too daunting, the process too discouraging? Were language barriers a 
factor? Answers to such questions are badly needed, well before the extended 
loan-application process ends. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, we know that the Small Business Administration is examining the high 
number of loan applications that were withdrawn (14,157 or about 12 times more 
than for the Midwest floods or Hurricane Andrew). We know that the SBA is also 
re-examining about 17,000 loans that were previously denied. In that regard, we 
note that the loan denial rate for Northridge has been higher than previous 
natural disasters as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Certain factors deserve consideration. It is arguable, for example, that 
California's deep recession was greater than anything faced by the Midwest 
before its floods, or by Florida before its hurricane. Did the downturn in the 
economy disqualify applicants who otherwise might have deserved aid? Perhaps 
the loan standards could be relaxed commensurately, to acknowledge the unusual 
recent lows of the state economy. 
</P>
<P>
 A plan pitched last week by U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown would offer 
California businesses funds that could be leveraged into greater amounts. The 
proposal could help some businesses become better loan prospects. Sounds good, 
but it's a relatively small program. 
</P>
<P>
 We also know that the SBA is attempting to give priority to the loans of 
businesses located in the ghost towns that have evolved since the quake. That's 
good, but when one visits such areas, one realizes that many merchants are 
still in the dark concerning the larger workings of government. Northridge 
quake victims need a specific telephone number -- just one, only one -- that 
they can call to obtain information. The only number now is mainly useful in 
directing people to one of the 10 quake-recovery service centers still open. 
That's not good enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The questions here are simply stated: Is there enough aid, and is enough being 
done to get it to those who need it? This must be closely examined in 
Washington, Sacramento and here at home, and soon.

BETRAYAL BY THE MILITARY IN NIGERIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Nigeria the death toll is climbing as police battle striking oil workers 
and others who are trying to pressure the military government to free a 
democratically elected president from prison. Much of the West African capital 
of Lagos is paralyzed by protests and lack of domestic fuel supplies. It does 
look as if Nigeria is descending into chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 Moshood Abiola would be president today if the military rulers had not voided 
democratically held elections in June, 1993. Abiola is charged with treason 
because he dared to claim the presidency. Threats forced him to flee to London. 
He bravely returned, only to be jailed. The military, in power for more than 10 
years, promise Abiola his freedom, but only if he relinquishes any claim to the 
presidency and silences his supporters. Why should Abiola concede to such an 
insane demand, and why should he believe promises of military leaders who 
threaten to jail him for life? 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, it is Nigeria that led African support of democracy in South 
Africa, and actively opposed apartheid. Closer to home, Nigerian troops led the 
successful West African regional peacekeeping force that helped end the civil 
war and promote elections in Liberia. Nigeria also voted in the U.N. Security 
Council to support democracy in Haiti, which of course also has an elected 
president who has been frozen from power. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for democracy, the tug of war between autocrats and self-rule 
has dominated Nigeria's government since independence in 1960. In this latest 
round of military rule, the generals have run the country for more than a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Few Nigerians are better off. Nigerian drug smugglers peddle heroin around the 
world. Guns proliferate in Lagos. Mismanagement threatens many of the economic 
gains of Nigeria, which was once oil-rich, relatively well-educated, powerful 
and the pride of sub-Saharan Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 As the protests threaten to turn to riots, the generals promise democracy 
again. The military rulers also tout another constitutional conference. Their 
words have proved worthless. 
</P>
<P>
 Civilian rule won't cure all the ills. But Nigerians, led by their rightful 
president, Moshood Abiola, deserve a say in how they are governed. By 
positioning itself as the enemy of democracy, the military government is the 
enemy of the people -- and thus the enemy of Nigeria.

WARD VALLEY: WORTHY FIGHT FOR FEINSTEIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nothing is more important to the economic health of California than the 
state's infrastructure. And no component of that infrastructure is more 
important than a safe water supply. Sen. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.) has 
mounted a sudden, back-door threat to an indispensable California water source, 
and Sen. Dianne Feinstein has got to join Sen. Barbara Boxer in stopping him. 
</P>
<P>
 The water source in question is the Colorado River. The threat to it is a 
low-level radioactive waste dump proposed for Ward Valley, 20 miles from the 
river and connected to it by ground water. Could radioactivity migrate from the 
dump to the river? 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert O'Brien is worried that it could. On 
June 16 he ordered the state to "suspend all approvals or activities relating 
to this project that could result in any change or alteration to the physical 
environment" until the state had addressed -- not pro forma but in a serious 
"pre-approval setting" -- his key concern: "Will the Colorado River be 
contaminated?" Because of "the extraordinary importance of what is at stake 
here, i.e., radioactive waste and drinking water," the judge argued, "any doubt 
must be resolved in the form of caution." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnston, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has 
introduced legislation that would sweep O'Brien's well-grounded caution aside 
and force the Clinton Administration to transfer the federally owned Ward 
Valley site to the state without waiting for the environmental review O'Brien 
ordered. If the Louisianan succeeds, the President will be forced to break his 
repeated promise to California that he would wait for court review to conclude 
before proceeding with his own evidentiary hearing under Interior Department 
auspices. 
</P>
<P>
 A National Academy of Sciences review, commissioned by Interior Secretary 
Bruce Babbitt, is now in progress. But the results of this review, along with 
those of the review O'Brien has called for, are not an alternative to the 
Interior Department's own evidentiary hearing. On the contrary, those results 
are parts of the evidence that Interior must be given time to consider. 
</P>
<P>
 Many related issues remain unresolved, but don't expect Johnston to consider 
them. His hearing (beginning today) on legislation probably -- in the Senate's 
patented backdoor manner -- to be introduced as an amendment to an 
appropriations bill is by invitation only and will not consider any of the 
topics that are of such concern to Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 As listed in a letter from Boxer to Johnston, these topics include, besides 
the contamination threat: the fear that US Ecology, with its abysmal track 
record, cannot be trusted to operate the facility; the fear that California 
taxpayers will face crushing liability if pollution occurs; the fear that the 
state does not accurately understand the nature and volume of the wastes 
destined for the site, and the fear that if pollution occurs remediation will 
be impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Feinstein, are you listening? This is not Sen. Boxer's issue. This is a 
California issue. And this is not just an environmental issue but also an 
utterly crucial economic issue. Both senators should rally their colleagues 
against this sneak attack on California's water supply.

PENTAGON PROCUREMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I had to smile when I read the editorial, "Is This the End of the $400 
Hammer?" (July 2) because it only focused on the use of "unnecessarily detailed 
technical specifications" in Defense Department procurement practices. Being in 
defense procurement, I agree that going to commercial standards is a step in 
the right direction, but it's merely a drop in the bucket! Much larger cost 
savings can be achieved by reforming the entire acquisition process. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense procurement is a large bureaucratic nightmare and it starts at the top 
with federal acquisition laws. In January, 1993, a Department of Defense law 
advisory panel released a report that reviewed over 600 statutes and determined 
that half of them could be amended, repealed, deleted, or consolidated. If 
these recommendations were adopted it would create a "waterfall effect." Fewer 
less complicated statutes would lead to less government oversight and 
bureaucracy. Less oversight would mean less contractor overhead. Less overhead 
leads directly to less cost. 
</P>
<P>
 If we can potentially save $12 billion per year by eliminating derailed 
technical specifications, just think what we could save by true defense 
acquisition reform. Hey, maybe enough to pay for President Clinton's health 
care plan!

GERMAN TROOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * German troops in Bosnia? Is the author of your editorial intentionally 
disregarding the lessons of history learned in a hard way when he calls ("Let 
Bosnia Be the Starting Place," July 13) for German troops? Does he know about 
German aspirations to control the Balkans -- the shortcut between Central 
Europe and Near East -- better known as their Drang Nach Osten policy, evident 
for at least a century? 
</P>
<P>
 These plans failed to materialize in World War I when German (and 
Austro-Hungarian) aggression against Serbia was characterized as 
"imperialism."Hitler's dreams, after occupying and dismembering Yugoslavia in 
the wake of World War II, were short-lived as well. Then they were labeled as 
"fascism" and "Nazism." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, 50 years later, under the "New World Order" doctrine, Germany is eagerly 
pushed to send troops on the soil of previous defeats -- in former Yugoslavia, 
for dismemberment of which it bears foremost and major responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 So, the "final solution" for the Serbian nation is unveiled by your editorial 
-- with the first step to defeat and destroy Bosnian Serbs (preferably the 
Serbs in Serbia proper as well). While the U.S. will provide air support, 
ground troops will be contributed by the coalition of European NATO allies (now 
with its key player Germany) and by invigorated and armed (the arms embargo 
will be overridden unilaterally, if needed) Bosnian Muslims, with substantial 
help of mercenaries from Islamic states all over the world. So much for 
impartiality of the United States and the United Nations regarding the civil 
war in former Yugoslavia!

 * Regarding the article on "Insight Tours" for foreign journalists (July 7): 
</P>
<P>
 I'm a gray-haired, Anglo-Saxon type, native Angeleno. I used to go to plays at 
the Inner City Cultural Center and Dia de Los Muertos celebrations at Self-Help 
Graphics.I used to take visitors to see Simon Rodia's Towers in Watts. Today? 
No way. Even nearby Koreatown puts out no welcome mat, and I am embarrassed for 
visitors to see what has happened to MacArthur Park and Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from political rhetoric aimed at fund-raising and tourist bucks, the 
often-proclaimed "wonderful cultural diversity" of Los Angeles, in reality, 
amounts to mean little pockets of mutual suspicion and fear. I'm sure that from 
the dollar standpoint, neighborhood tours for visiting World Cup journalists 
was a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 However, why doesn't someone come up with some neighborhood tours to help us 
Los Angeles residents rebuild our civic pride? Our own restored pride would be 
the kind of good advertising money can't buy.

HEALTH-CARE CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The Times is correct to warn Congress that failure to enact national 
health-care reform will bring on many ill-considered state initiatives 
(editorial, July 11). But The Times is mistaken if it believes that political 
compromise and halfway measures can even begin to address the complex and 
deep-rooted problems of the health-care system. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the dilemma of health-care reform: that the threat of unintended 
consequences hangs like a sword of Damocles over every halfway measure. These 
issues demand more than political philosophy; they demand workable solutions. 
We need universal coverage and genuine reform, not a political snow job.

<P>
 * In "Single-Payer Plan for Health Care Sparks Furor" (July 10) you write that 
the cost of the single-payer initiative, starting at $100 billion per year, 
would dwarf the state budget of $57.3 billion, which includes the county health 
program. A thoroughly accurate, unbiased story would indicate that with the 
adoption of the single-payer plan, there would no longer be a cost factor of 
health care in the county budget. Workers' compensation medical costs as well 
as auto insurance medical bills would also be covered, resulting in major 
savings in taxes and auto insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The ideal story would have also included the fact that as of June 22, the 
single-payer initiative was unanimously endorsed by the State Legislative 
Committee of the AARP (American Assn. of Retired Persons), whose California 
membership is about 3 million. When you consider the fact that AARP derives a 
sizable income from its health insurance program, its support of the 
single-payer initiative reflects the overwhelming support of its membership for 
the plan.

 * The Times' report on the opposition to the single-payer health reform ballot 
initiative (July 7) is well balanced, but fails to mention the massive role of 
insurance industry interests in the coalition of "business groups" opposing the 
single-payer plan. The National Underwriter issue for June 27 reports that over 
half a dozen insurance industry associations have roles in the 
anti-single-payer crusade. 
</P>
<P>
 And no wonder. The single-payer plan is able to achieve universal 
comprehensive coverage without overall cost increases precisely because it 
eliminates the role of the insurance companies, their enormous profits and 
administrative waste and the expensive billing bureaucracy and medical care 
micromanagement that they impose on health-care providers.

 * Harry M. Goldin's commentary on financial incentives and restraints built 
into health maintenance organizations (" 'Gatekeepers' May Be Hazardous to Your 
Health," July 11) inaccurately represents how HMOs work. Goldin cites an HMO 
patient whose primary care physician handled a dermatological disorder instead 
of referring to an outside specialist, as an example of HMO financial 
incentives coercing doctors to undertreat patients. No responsible physician 
would postpone needed treatment for financial reasons, because doctors are 
professionals dedicated to patients' well-being, and because postponing 
necessary care ultimately leads to higher costs when patients experience more 
serious illnesses that could have been detected early or prevented. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial incentives are at work in medicine, as in most professions. 
Traditional fee-for-service medicine rewards practitioners for providing 
multiple services, needed or not. HMOs, however, reward doctors for practicing 
preventive care, keeping people well, continually improving quality of care and 
adhering to the best practices. The fact is that HMOs provide physicians with 
powerful incentives to prevent illness and treat patients early on. 
</P>
<P>
 HMOs believe that referrals should be based on medical needs and encourage 
appropriate use of specialists to prevent further complications. The point is 
to know when to refer and when not to refer. By reducing the frequency of 
unnecessary referrals, HMOs help patients avoid the risks of overtreatment 
without compromising needed services and quality of care. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldin incorrectly claims that physicians who are "at risk" for care face a 
conflict of interest. HMOs pay physicians a competitive compensation to provide 
all necessary care. If a physician denies appropriate care, that physician is 
violating his or her professional ethics and may be committing malpractice. 
</P>
<P>
 HMOs have a proven track record of providing affordable, high-quality, 
comprehensive health care in California over the past 60 years. Five years ago 
California HMO enrollment stood at 8 million. Today, nearly 12 million 
Californians receive quality health care from HMOs.

PERSPECTIVE ON ISLAM; A WITCH HUNT IN THE NAME OF ALLAH; EXTREMISTS USE 
SANCTIMONY TO JUSTIFY BARBAROUS ACTS, LIKE ENCOURAGING THE MURDER OF TASLIMA 
NASRIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MILTON VIORST, Milton Viorst, author of Sandcastles: The Arabs in Search of 
the Modern World (Knopf, 1994) is working on a book about Islam. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The government of Bangladesh would have us believe that if Islamic extremists 
carry out their threat to kill novelist Taslima Nasrin, who is alleged to have 
made a blasphemous remark about the Koran, then she certainly has it coming to 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 Nasrin, a 32-year-old feminist whose writing has offended conservative 
Bangladeshis, is currently in hiding from the fanatics who have put a bounty of 
$10,000 on her head. The government, far from protecting her, is searching for 
her so that it can subject her to its own charges of insulting religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Bangladeshi ambassador to Washington denied that his 
government, in pursuing Nasrin, was capitulating to fundamentalism. He 
acknowledged, however, that "voices are being raised making blasphemy 
punishable by death," implying that his government is considering such a law. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard-line fundamentalists, whose audacity has been growing steadily in the 
Islamic world, defend their zealotry toward Nasrin with the claim that they are 
upholding the purity of their faith. In fact, Islam has lived very nicely for 
1,300 years without imposing a death penalty for blasphemy, and it surely faces 
less jeopardy from Nasrin's literary indiscretions than from the excesses of 
her persecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether in Bangladesh or elsewhere in Islam, the fundamentalists are not so 
much promoting piety as seeking political power. They differ from other 
political parties only by their exploitation of religion. In contrast to the 
tolerance of the Koran, they have shaped their own doctrine, calling it the 
"true" Islam. Self-righteous and mean-spirited, it contains a strain of 
violence that threatens to undermine all of Islamic society. 
</P>
<P>
 This violence is directed not simply -- perhaps not even predominantly -- 
against the body. This extremism targets its terrorism on the mind, seeking to 
keep Islamic society in the intellectual backwaters where it has stagnated for 
centuries. The extremists' aim is to stifle any challenge to orthodoxy, any 
loosening of the cultural status quo. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, extremists killed Farag Foda, one of Egypt's creative Islamic 
thinkers. In Algeria, they have murdered scholars and poets. In Turkey, their 
target has been outspoken journalists. Their success can be measured by the 
silence of Muslim intellectuals in Nasrin's case, and earlier in Salman 
Rushdie's. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt the secular politics that the fundamentalists decry has been a 
disappointment to Muslims. In the decades since decolonization, the governments 
of the Islamic world have been overwhelmed by the problems of overpopulation 
and underdevelopment, which they have aggravated by their own incompetence and 
corruption. The need for a new vision is obvious; the fundamentalists have been 
quick to seize the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 What they offer, however, is little more than a slogan: "Islam is the answer." 
Meanwhile, they have no economic program to confront the problems, and while 
demanding elections, they acknowledge that they will suppress democracy as soon 
as they take over. Society needs to punish Nasrin's impiety, they say; but 
would Bangladesh, long pitied for its intractable poverty, be any better off 
after she is gone? 
</P>
<P>
 The Bangladeshi ambassador said that what his country does with Nasrin is none 
of the world's business. But the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights, representing 
current international standards, affirms her right to free thought and 
expression, and the world can hardly accept the fundamentalists' claim that 
their harsh view of Islamic law supersedes it. 
</P>
<P>
 Support for human rights is a pillar of American foreign policy, practiced in 
behalf of dissidents in the Soviet Union and, more recently and with some risk, 
in China (leading to a confrontation from which we backed away). But in dealing 
with Islamic extremism, the Clinton Administration has adopted a notably low 
profile. Does it hold that Nasrin's rights are of a lower order than the rights 
of dissenters to communism? 
</P>
<P>
 Some Islamists have argued that the West, since the Soviets' fall, has made 
fundamentalism its new bogey. Such a claim begs the issue. The quarrel involved 
here is not with religion or its interpretation. It is with the sanctimony that 
the practitioners of extremist doctrines have adopted to justify barbarous acts 
-- like encouraging the murder of Nasrin. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage that Islamic extremism can inflict is not limited to Muslims. Human 
rights and democracy are an uncertain vision in dozens of countries. Triumphant 
extremism in Islam can inspire a worldwide rise of terror that undermines these 
values everywhere. The reverberations of the Nasrin case go beyond the borders 
of Bangladesh. They should be a warning to all of us.

COLUMN RIGHT/ CAL THOMAS: HIT LIMBAUGH, AND YOU HIT MID-AMERICA; HE GIVES VOICE 
TO PEOPLE WITH HONEST VALUES WHO WON'T BE DEMEANED TO COVER LIBERAL LAPSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Rush Limbaugh doesn't need me to defend him. He does well enough speaking for 
himself on the 648 radio and 250 television stations that carry his message, 
and in the 6 million copies of his books that are in print. He is a network to 
millions of people who have for years wanted something or someone in the media 
to reflect their views and values. Now that they've found him, they're 
rewarding Limbaugh with their allegiance, which translates into big ratings and 
lots of book sales. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, his detractors have begun what appears to be a coordinated 
attempt to discredit him. Newspaper columns and paid newspaper ads allege 
"factual errors" in some of his comments (would that someone held the big media 
accountable for their very real and numerous factual errors and unprofessional 
editorializing disguised as "reporting"). 
</P>
<P>
 The liberals' counterattack on Limbaugh is flawed in at least two ways. They 
are lowering themselves to the very name-calling they claim he engages in, and 
by labeling him a "jerk" and "charlatan," they are demeaning the middle-class 
people who are his greatest fans and adding to the view that liberals are out 
of touch with middle America.  
</P>
<P>
 From reading some of what his critics write, it seems clear they have not 
listened to his show, at least not long enough to become familiar with its 
rhythms and the deeply held beliefs of those who call and who truly love him. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, that's right, love him. The intensity of their loyalty and gratitude for 
expressing what they believe, but can never communicate to a mass audience 
because the elite media block or distort their voices, is misunderstood by the 
left at its own peril. 
</P>
<P>
 Limbaugh's critics are furious that he has beaten them at their own game. They 
are angry that he is exposing what they have tried to cover up, namely, fraud 
and hypocrisy in their own government and inside the education, political and 
media Establishments. They are especially furious that he does not fit the 
conservative stereotype they've worked so long and hard to create: that of a 
three-piece-suit-wearing, white-sock-clad, Bible-thumping, snake-handling, 
book-burning, uneducated, humorless dunderhead who drives a pickup truck with a 
gun rack. In fact, Limbaugh is intelligent and incredibly fast on his feet, and 
he is having a good time while making gobs of money. His roots are Midwestern. 
I've met his mother and his brother, who is an attorney, on a trip to his 
hometown, Cape Girardeau, Mo. They are salt-of-the-earth people with senses of 
humor, the type most hard-working Americans would identify with. They aren't 
flashy, just decent folk who go to church on Sunday and think their government 
wants to replace God as the most powerful force in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 What most people don't realize is that Limbaugh is a humorist and satirist -- 
with much more bite than Will Rogers. He hasn't used his invented word, 
femi-Nazi, on the air in a year because, he says, he wanted to see how many of 
his critics were actually listening. Not many, it appears, as most who write or 
speak against him constantly mention the term, which he has said was never 
intended to smear all women or even all feminists -- just the tiny core of the 
most radical among them. 
</P>
<P>
 In a USA Today column, Limbaugh says he thinks jealousy is the reason most 
liberal journalists enjoy attacking and misquoting him. That's part of it, but 
there is a more profound reason. The left knows it has lost the culture war and 
the idea war over America's political, economic and foreign-policy direction. 
To keep from being held accountable, it must create bogymen (bogypersons?) to 
shift the public's attention from its failed record to the perceived "threat." 
</P>
<P>
 On rare occasions when critics debate him on "Nightline" or in some other 
forum, Limbaugh blows them away in an avalanche of facts and pugilistic 
rhetoric. It is an awesome sight, something like watching Margaret Thatcher 
destroy her Labor Party adversaries during debates in the House of Commons when 
she was prime minister.  
</P>
<P>
 Limbaugh should challenge some of his most visible critics to a public debate, 
not about him, but about the mess they have made of America. If they want to 
blast the generation that gave us Ozzie and Harriet, let him make the liberals 
defend Beavis and Butthead. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep it up, Rush. Their words can never hurt you, but your verbal sticks and 
stones are killing them. That's why they are reduced to calling you names 
instead of owning up to their responsibility as unindicted co-conspirators in 
the wrecking of this once-great nation.

COLUMN LEFT/ JONATHAN FREEDMAN: SAVE OUR STATE? IT'S MORE LIKE SPITE OUR STATE; 
THIS INITIATIVE, BRAINCHILD OF A MAN WHO WAS BURNED BY AN ILLEGAL CONTRACTOR, 
WOULD AMOUNT TO ETHNIC CLEANSING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN FREEDMAN, Jonathan Freedman is a writer in San Diego. He won the 
1987 Pulitzer Prize for commentary on immigration and amnesty. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California is in a borderline state of mind between desperation and 
xenophobia. The unease of feeling like aliens in our own land is partly due to 
our federal system, which forbids states from controlling their borders; partly 
due to the geocultural reality of a region that ethnographer Joel Garreau calls 
"Mex-America," a former Mexican territory slowly being reabsorbed by la 
reconquista. Where once American migrants from the Dust Bowl sought the 
California Dream, now their embittered descendants scapegoat immigrants for its 
changing reality. In the fat years, California beckons undocumented immigrants 
to pick its strawberries, make its motel beds and nurture its babies. In the 
lean years, we demonize the strangers in our midst, blaming them for 
pestilence, unemployment and criminality, including the crime of being born. 
</P>
<P>
 The grapes of wrath are being cultivated anew by a group calling itself Save 
Our State, which has qualified an initiative for the November ballot. The SOS 
initiative is vintage 1994 California white Zinfandel with a blush of populism 
and a nutty nativist flavor. It is being marketed with great success -- a Los 
Angeles Times poll shows 62% favor it -- as a tonic for California's ills. Its 
provisions are designed for purgative effect: SOS would purge undocumented 
children from public schools, where bilingual programs teach them to read and 
write English; purge their mothers from MediCal clinics, where they receive 
life- and cost-saving prenatal care; purge poor undocumented families from Aid 
to Families With Dependent Children, plunging their American-born children 
deeper into poverty. This is not only irrational; it is also unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1982 Supreme Court decision, upholding the right of undocumented children to 
receive public education in Texas, would almost certainly invalidate key parts 
of the California initiative. Why, then, put so much effort into getting it 
passed? The answer is simple, and troubling: SOS was born out of spite. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was conceived by Ron Prince, an obscure accountant in Orange County 
who lost half a million dollars in an aborted house construction project. 
Prince says he was bilked by the contractor, who, he later discovered, was 
neither licensed nor a legal resident. Prince asked local authorities to 
prosecute, to no avail. Frustrated, he stood in front of a supermarket with a 
homespun petition; few people signed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew something needed to be done, but I didn't know what," Prince said. If 
the disgruntled accountant had dropped it there, California might have been 
spared the "Spite Our State" campaign. But Prince teamed up with two Reagan-era 
immigration officials now working as lobbyists. Harold Ezell and Alan Nelson 
knew how to hit hot buttons for political profit. They helped draft the 
Draconian provisions that would turn teachers into border guards, disrupt and 
create a permanent alien underclass vulnerable to pogroms. 
</P>
<P>
 The flaw of this misguided initiative is that it confuses immigration policy, 
solely a federal responsibility, with policies for immigrants, which are under 
federal, state and local control. This distinction is important. It is 
appropriate for a nation to choose whether to open or close its borders to 
immigrants. But it is hypocritical for citizens en masse to subvert immigration 
laws by inviting illegal immigrants to do their dirty work and then hound their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 The place to halt immigration is at the border, where the Clinton 
Administration is focusing increased manpower. The second line is employer 
sanctions, punishing bosses who knowingly hire undocumented workers. Employer 
sanctions are the law of the land, the very law Ron Prince unwittingly broke by 
hiring an undocumented contractor to build his house. If millions of 
Californians continue to knowingly hire undocumented workers while moving to 
violate their children's basic rights, our collective house is in sad shape.  
</P>
<P>
 California's border anxiety reflects deep ambivalences about our identity, 
ethnic composition and place in the world. These conflicts cannot be resolved 
by cutting off our nose to spite our face, but by looking in the mirror and 
seeing the reality of who we are, how we got here and where nativist fears are 
taking us. People who feel frustrated and powerless are easily manipulated by 
false saviors to turn on their neighbors. It happened in Europe during the Nazi 
era; in Cambodia under Pol Pot; it's still happening in Bosnia and Rwanda. A 
bloodless ethnic cleansing masked in the trappings of a democratic vote can 
happen here. Save our state from SOS.

JULIAN SCHWINGER; NOBEL PHYSICIST, PROFESSOR AT HARVARD AND UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Julian Schwinger, a Wunderkind of physics who earned his doctorate at 21, was 
a full professor at Harvard at 29 and won the Nobel Prize when he was 47, died 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the UCLA physics department said Monday that Schwinger -- who 
came to the university full time in 1972 -- was 76 when he died of pancreatic 
cancer at his Bel-Air home. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwinger, who was then teaching at Harvard, shared the 1965 Nobel with 
Richard Feynman of Caltech and Shinichero Tomonaga of Japan for work on the 
theory of quantum electrodynamics. The exceedingly complex theory deals with 
the fields and interactions of elementary particles. 
</P>
<P>
 Mildly eccentric, Schwinger in his early years was known for preferring to 
sleep during the day and work at night. 
</P>
<P>
 At a 60th-birthday tribute to him in 1978, a colleague recalled that when 
everyone else working at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's radiation 
laboratory during World War II was leaving at 5 p.m., "Julian was just 
arriving." 
</P>
<P>
 Schwinger was working on radar projects at MIT and later joined the Manhattan 
Project, which developed the first atom bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 His awards were numerous. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson presented him the newly created National 
Medal of Science. In 1951 he was one of two young scientists selected for the 
first Albert Einstein award, established by the Institute for Advanced Study at 
Princeton, where Einstein was in residence. And the National Academy of 
Sciences, to which he belonged for 45 years, awarded him its Nature of Light 
prize in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwinger, the son of a dress manufacturer, was a child prodigy who skipped 
three grades of public school and entered City College of New York at 14. He 
transferred to Columbia University and received a bachelor of arts degree when 
he was 17, then studied at the University of Wisconsin and Purdue University 
before earning his doctorate at Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved to Berkeley, where he worked with J. Robert Oppenheimer before 
returning to teach at Harvard. When he became a full professor there, he was 
one of the youngest to have achieved that rank in the 300-year history of the 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond his contributions as a scientist, Schwinger was considered one of 
UCLA's best and most beloved teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He directed more than 70 doctoral theses and is the ancestor of at least four 
generations of physicists," said David Saxon, UCLA professor emeritus of 
physics and president emeritus of the University of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of those students went on to win their own Nobel Prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Julian was a gentle, cultivated man and one of a handful of scientists whose 
magnificent contributions made science the great intellectual adventure of the 
20th Century," Saxon added. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Chancellor Charles E. Young said Schwinger "will be remembered as one of 
the great intellectual leaders of UCLA." 
</P>
<P>
 Schwinger's friends said he loved music as well as physics. He was an ardent 
pianist who studied for most of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "If something is worth doing, it is worth doing badly," he once said of his 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife, Clarice.

HANNS KORNELL; NAPA VALLEY WINE PIONEER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hanns Kornell, a pioneer winemaker who got out of a Nazi concentration camp 
and eventually made his way to the United States, where he was to bring 
sparkling wine to the Napa Valley, has died at his home at age 83. 
</P>
<P>
 The German-born Kornell, third generation of a Rhine Valley wine-making 
family, had been in ill health for the last six years, since suffering a 
serious head injury while working in the winery he founded in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 Kornell was imprisoned at the Dachau concentration camp in 1938 with his 
Jewish parents. The British consul to Germany appealed for eight months to win 
his release, with the stipulation that he leave Germany within 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 He fled to England, where he worked as a dishwasher to save money for passage 
to the United States. The ship he took was torpedoed by a German submarine, but 
Kornell was rescued and landed in New York with $2 in his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 He hitchhiked to California and began working at odd jobs, and was soon making 
sparkling wine for other winemakers while saving his money for his dream winery 
in the Napa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1952, working after hours at his own small, rented facility, Kornell 
finally produced the bubbly bearing his name. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1958, Kornell had saved enough money to acquire the historic Larkmead 
Cellar south of Calistoga, a stone building that reminded him of his native 
Germany. He renamed it Kornell Champagne Cellars. 
</P>
<P>
 The wine that made Kornell famous was a Riesling-based bubbly made like the 
German Sekt of his youth, a wine he began making in 1972. It was called Sehr 
Trocken, which in German means 'very dry.' 
</P>
<P>
 A downturn in the sparkling wine market in the late 1980s, however, placed the 
winery in financial straits. Kornell and his wife, Marylouise, filed 
bankruptcy. The winery eventually was sold to Napa Valley winemaker Koerner 
Rombauer and its name was changed back to Larkmead Cellars. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his wife, Kornell is survived by a daughter, Paula, and a son, 
Peter. Funeral services in the Napa Valley are pending.

<P>
 Crayola crayons, one of the most familiar smells of childhood, are about to 
throw the younger generation for a fruit loop. 
</P>
<P>
 Binney & Smith Co. is introducing 16 crayons containing miniature capsules 
that burst with aroma as they are used. The scents include cherries, chocolate, 
licorice, bananas and bubble gum. "This idea smelled like a winner from day one 
because it brought a whole new dimension to the coloring experience," spokesman 
Brad Drexler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Binney & Smith turned up its nose at some scents, including blue cheese, 
leather, new car, peanut butter and skunk.

 T-Bill Rates Fall: The Treasury Department sold $12.4 billion of new 
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 4.31%, down from 4.50% last 
week. Another $12.4 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average 
discount rate of 4.71%, down from 4.94%.The three-month bill rate was the 
lowest since they sold for 4.20% on June 27, and the six-month bill rate was 
the lowest since they averaged 4.60% the same day. The new discount rates 
understate the actual return to investors: 4.42% for three-month bills, with a 
$10,000 bill selling for $9,891.10, and 4.89% for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,761.90. The discount rate reflects the price discount received when 
government securities are purchased at less than face value. T-Bill Auction

STABLE DOLLAR BRACES STOCKS; DOW UP 1.62 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The stock market drifted higher in thin trading Monday. Some wary investors 
were encouraged by lower interest rates, a steady dollar and good corporate 
earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.62 points to 3,755.43. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones about 10 to 
9 on the New York Stock Exchange. Big Board volume came to a light 227.46 
million shares, down from the 275.86 million shares traded Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 There was little news to guide investors, so they looked to the bond market, 
said James Melcher, founder and president of Balestra Capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very slow day with little happening," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lower bond rates boosted credit market prices. The Treasury's bellwether 
30-year bond yield dipped to 7.50% from 7.54% on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 That was good for stocks, because lower rates cut the cost of borrowing money 
and make share prices more appealing relative to interest-bearing investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar rose in New York to 98.35 Japanese yen, up from 97.85 yen on 
Friday. Against the German currency, the dollar closed at 1.547 marks, down 
from 1.554. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. currency's performance was also encouraging, analysts said. The 
greenback has ridden a rocky road downward against some other major currencies 
in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar's decline raised fears of inflation and thus higher interest rates 
down the road as the cost of imports rises. Its stable performance Monday meant 
investors didn't have to focus on the direction of interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Profit news, meanwhile, drove the stocks of some companies. Midlantic rose 7/8 
to 30 3/8 and Upjohn rose 1/2 to 30 5/8 on the NYSE. Both released reports of 
strong quarterly earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Hays, investment strategist at Wheat First-Butcher & Singer, said that 
since Wednesday, when second-quarter corporate earnings reports began in 
earnest, 612 companies have weighed in. Of those, 72% showed results better 
than those of last year's second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, however, investors were cautious Monday, said Alfred Goldman, director 
of technical market analysis with A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. Last week, the Dow 
average rose 44.67 points, and the Nasdaq composite index ended 13.90 points 
higher for the five trading days. 
</P>
<P>
 "A little rest is only natural," Goldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Melcher said many market players were reluctant to make significant moves 
before Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan gives his semiannual 
testimony on monetary policy and the economy before the Senate Banking 
Committee on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks ended mostly higher abroad. Tokyo stocks closed lower in thin trading, 
with the Nikkei 225-share average falling 52.51 points to 20,717.64.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; SOUNDGARDEN AT THE OLYMPIC : PATIENCE IS ITS OWN REWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell looked anything but patient as he paced like 
a caged tiger Sunday on the stage of the refurbished Grand Olympic Auditorium.  
</P>
<P>
 He pounded his fist on his guitar while singing songs whose tones ranged from 
petulant ("Mailman," which he said was about "killing your boss") to 
spiritually anxious ("Superunknown"). And later he leaped into the audience to 
go after some guy annoying him with a flashlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the unstated message of the concert was 180 degrees opposite of that 
scene, and of the mood of the youthful audience the band represents: Patience 
pays off. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Seattle scene that Soundgarden comes from has been marked by the 
"instant" blockbusters of Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains, this tortoise 
of a band has steadily evolved and matured into a powerful, eloquent, 
first-class act. With the recent album "Super-unknown" having sold 2 million 
copies and now residing in the Top 10, Sunday's show had the feeling of a 
long-awaited coming-out party. 
</P>
<P>
 As it has been since the band emerged in the late '80s -- well before its 
Northwest comrades -- Cornell's confident command was the most compelling 
element of the show. But now the rest of the package has risen to his level. 
</P>
<P>
 The songs from "Superunknown," which dominated the concert, are hypnotic, 
forceful blends of undulating riffs and mystical imagery, covering an 
impressive range of moods. 
</P>
<P>
 And the tight yet raw playing of guitarist Kim Thayil, bassist Ben Shepherd 
and drummer Matt Cameron is finally transcending the blatant Zeppelin-Sabbath 
roots, complementing Cornell's rock-operatic wail and charged presence. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The secret of the show, though, was how Cornell embodied that tricky man-child 
paradox of youthful frustration and mature control. The nearly two-hour set was 
preceded by a short film showing a boy cycling on his Stingray through a 
mystical world directed by strange gods. In the show, Cornell was both that 
confused boy, trying to fathom the forces that shape his life, and a rock god 
looked to for answers by his fans. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a timeless dichotomy, the very stuff on which rock 'n' roll was founded. 
But Cornell at his best makes it his own. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who have watched as the band slowly, steadily realized its potential 
over the years, it was worth the wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Patience will also be required if the Olympic, hosting its first rock concert 
in years, is to become a regular venue. The 6,000-capacity room offers both 
reserved seating and an open floor for the hyperkinetic moshers. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Sunday the sound was muddy and booming, and the staff seemed at a loss 
directing people to their seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-billed Rev. Horton Heat's hyper-speed Texas psychobilly proved 
impressive for his fleet-fingered guitar work, but he and his two band mates 
lacked the variety or originality to be anything more than a curiosity.

THEATER REVIEW; HOUSEWIFE'S LAMENTS MAKE FOR A LAMENTABLE 'HEARTBEATS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whoever advised songwriter Amanda McBroom to build her 1986 revue "Heartbeats" 
into a full book musical must have introduced Faye Dunaway to Andrew Lloyd 
Webber. 
</P>
<P>
 Most famous for writing the pop standard "The Rose," a good song tacked 
shamelessly onto the end of the show, McBroom stars as Annie in this saga of a 
housewife on the eve of her 20th wedding anniversary and about to turn the big 
Four-O ("the O stands for Oh My God"). The show, with book also by McBroom, is 
at the Pasadena Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Familiar cannot describe the concerns of Annie's household; each detail seems 
to have been weighed for highest possible banality content. 
</P>
<P>
 Annie worries about her roots (hair, that is), her sit-ups and the car 
insurance. She realizes that her life's not so bad when she opens the paper and 
sees that people are killing people. Her husband, Steve, (played by McBroom's 
actual husband, George Ball) watches too much football. Rock musicians and the 
IRS make him mad. His favorite catalogue? Could it be, I don't know, Victoria's 
Secret? It could and it is. 
</P>
<P>
 The actors playing their two college-age children seem to be doing some kind 
of imitation of wild youth today, as conceived by Pat Boone. The daughter 
performs bogus rap steps while describing Rocky, who is both "cool" and "a 
really awesome boyfriend." 
</P>
<P>
 One wonders what all-American problems might befall this household. Will their 
son's bad grade endanger his pole-vaulting scholarship? Will their daughter and 
Rocky get tattoos? But, most important, will Annie and Steve learn to talk to 
each other again and save their marriage, particularly after Annie's dangerous 
visit to a nightclub that features male waiters with bare chests?  
</P>
<P>
 "Heartbeats" is particularly misguided because McBroom is entirely capable of 
writing songs that illuminate and distill the poignancy in ordinary situations. 
One ballad, "Ship in a Bottle," sung by the teen-age Annie (Michele Maika), is 
a haunting folk song for a sheltered young woman who hungers for the world. It 
could, however, be any young woman, and is in reality not a theater song 
because it has nothing to do with character. 
</P>
<P>
 If the ballads are touching but wrong, the up-tempo songs are embarrassing 
(some of the music has been provided by other composers). "I Like to Look," 
with music by Gerald Sternbach, is an ogling number for Annie and her two 
friends as they drop napkins to better check out their waiters' butts. "The 
Shopper's Fugue," also by Sternbach, is completely perplexing -- three grocery 
clerks tap dance in sequined aprons and sing about what's on sale. The number 
looks like an outtake from the new show at the Ralphs theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 As a performer, McBroom deserves better writing than she can provide herself. 
She's classy but chilly, rather like the latter-day Mary Tyler Moore, whom she 
resembles, but without the material. She and Ball approximate marital stupor 
with authenticity.  
</P>
<P>
 The other four actors perform a variety of roles. Only Michele Maika stands 
out, an unusually graceful presence. She needs to lose some of the excessive 
vibrato (suggesting she played Eponine in "Les Miserables" for just a shade too 
long) and the effect of her beauty would be greater if her awareness of it were 
less. But she seems destined for far bigger game. 
</P>
<P>
 Director and choreographer Bill Castellino seems to be staging the big summer 
show at Bob Jones University. The actors stride across the stage and telegraph 
the importance of the lyrics with meaningful glances, clenching their fists and 
raising their arms, sometimes in unison, sometimes each in their own separate 
Angst .  
</P>
<P>
 Linda Hacker has designed a set that could have been effective, if anything 
else was. The wooden frames of Annie's house are visible, and the walls are 
made of black-and-white photos, some torn out in the shape of puzzle pieces.  
</P>
<P>
 At their best, McBroom's songs take small things, turn them over and reveal 
how rich they in fact are. "Heartbeats," conversely, takes small things and 
makes them so infinitesimal as to be invisible. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Heartbeats," the Pasadena Playhouse, 39 S . El Molino Avenue, Pasadena, 
Tuesday-Friday, 8 p.m., Saturday at 5 p.m. and 9 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m. and 7 
p.m. Ends August 21. $33.50. (818) 356-7529 or (213) 480-3232. Running time: 2

ART REVIEW; PAINTERS PUT WRY SPIN ON HIGH, LOW CULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Good news for fellow travelers in the summer art wasteland: Griffin Fine Art 
in Costa Mesa is showing hip yet endearing abstract paintings by two young Los 
Angeles artists through July 31. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Roden and Daniel Manns have worked out personal styles based on such 
disparate things as wordplay, early-'60s color schemes, computer graphics, Zen 
pattern-making and a tongue-in-cheek replay of Color Field painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Roden graduated from the Otis Art Institute of Parsons School of Design in 
L.A. in 1986 and earned his master of fine arts degree at Art Center College of 
Design in Pasadena. Manns is an Orange County native and attended Orange Coast 
College. Both artists have been in exhibitions at several critically 
well-regarded L.A. area galleries, including "Germinal Notations" at Food House 
and "Sawtelle" at Domestic Setting. 
</P>
<P>
 Roden's paintings on small (and very small) wood panels play little visual 
games with words. The irregular, hand-drawn lettering mingles with decorative 
devices and ghostly snatches of imagery that often seem trapped beneath layers 
of beeswax or urethane. I found them instantly captivating for purely visual 
reasons; only later did I concern myself with what they may mean. 
</P>
<P>
 Details coolly recall early-'60s fabric patterns (bull's-eyes, elongated 
ovals, pinwheels), Abstract Expressionist painting cliches (wiry, tangled 
lines) or pop culture objects (martini olives, tears). Made with the help of 
computer-generated imagery, the compositions have a dreamy, subconscious 
quality -- like a cross between doodling and writing the first draft of a poem. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a couple of works ("Iambic Pentameter," "The Last Poem of John 
Clare") refer directly to poetry. Painted on tin, the latter work has a 
flickering metallic sheen. The outline of a tall, stacked shape reminiscent of 
a Russian Suprematist construction accompanies a trio of echoing words: nest, 
vessel, rest.  
</P>
<P>
 The shape recalls the painstaking job of "building" a poem; the sheen evokes 
the luminous effect of getting it right. Clare was an impoverished English 
19th-Century landscape poet who worked as a day laborer and spent the last 
decades of his life in an insane asylum writing what some believe was his best 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Inconsiderable Things," the word silent appears three times, along with 
three beach balls and a couple of meandering ornamental flourishes. The 
painting encapsulates a random yet arbitrary universe in which words, images of 
objects and apparently meaningless designs share the same space. Why should the 
letters s-i-l-e-n-t and the stripe pattern signifying "beach ball" be more 
meaningful than several elaborate squiggles? Because everything depends on our 
tacit understanding of signs and symbols. 
</P>
<P>
 Silence and emptiness -- scrutinized in a wryly clinical way, as if putting 
quotation marks around the self-pitying modes of adolescence and bad poets -- 
are leitmotifs of Roden's paintings and his 39 drawings in colored pencil on 
index cards. One of the drawings contains the phrase "tears were standing in 
our eyes," with a group of capital I's standing around like lonely figures in 
an empty landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nine years ago, Manns' work in a student exhibition was awarded "best of show" 
by then-Laguna Art Museum director William Otton. These days, Manns is having 
fun with a bunch of familiar pop culture and modern art devices, ranging from 
lipsticked "kiss" prints to striped swatches of fabric that playfully erode the 
high seriousness of stripe paintings from the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 In these untitled paintings, low culture subsumes high culture in the most 
beguiling ways. Veering-on-cheesy color combinations (yellow and tan, peach and 
green, purple and green) evoke the curious popular tastes of the early '60s. 
Those years were also the heyday of Color Field painting, envisioned as a 
coolly rational alternative to the Sturm und Drang of Abstract Expressionism, 
as well as Pop Art. 
</P>
<P>
 Big-scale motifs that look like unraveled skeins of yarn (a popular '60s craft 
medium) variously suggest viscera, DNA and the huge image of canned spaghetti 
in Pop artist James Rosenquist's famous 1965 painting of contemporary American 
life in overdrive, "The F-111." 
</P>
<P>
 In one of Manns' paintings, a row of giant gray comma shapes superimposed on a 
tangle of skeins recalls Supergraphics, the commercial Pop spinoff; below, a 
small swatch of striped fabric amusingly mimics a bar code. 
</P>
<P>
 As smart and witty as this work is, it also communicates beautifully on a 
purely visual level. Manns' exuberant compositions keep the eye roving and the 
senses revved up. If he still lived in Orange County, he'd cream the 
competition; as it is, he is one of a glorious crop of younger L.A. artists 
whose work we too rarely get to see down here. 
</P>
<P>
 * Paintings by Steve Roden and Daniel Manns are at Griffin Fine Art, 1640 
Pomona Ave., Costa Mesa, through July 31. Hours: 6 to 11 p.m. Thursdays ; 10 
a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturdays ; noon to 5 p.m. Sundays; or by appointment.

 The California Arts Council has raised the grant rankings of two Orange County 
music organizations. The Pacific Chorale went from a 4- last year to a 4 on the 
CAC's 1 to 4 scale, while the Pacific Symphony moved from a 3+to a 4-.They have 
requested $39,632 and $221,283, respectively, in state arts support this year. 
The council's rankings of two other groups were unchanged from last year: 
Master Chorale of Orange County, 3- (requesting $39,000); and Opera Pacific, 
4-($221,283). Rankings are used to determine grant amounts, which the council 
will announce at its Sept. 8 meeting.

THEATER REVIEW; DANCE-HAPPY 'NANETTE' SAYS YES, YES TO FRIVOLITY AND FUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Early in "No, No, Nanette," the title character is warned to avoid flappers 
"who think life is one long giggle." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those flapper girls have nothing on "No, No, Nanette," the 1920s musical so 
light and frothy it makes "42nd Street" look like Greek tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 High kicks and soft-shoe, lame jokes and "Tea for Two" -- these foolish things 
have sustained Vincent Youmans' three-act lollipop, off and on, for 70 years. 
It is not the oldest musical in American theater history, but at times it 
certainly feels that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Civic Light Opera has mounted a lavishly appointed, cheerfully 
acted revival of Burt Shevelove's celebrated adaptation, an improbable hit on 
Broadway in the early '70s. Revised or not, "Nanette" feels very out of step 
with the dark, literary musicals of the Sondheim era. Whether that's welcome 
depends on one's need for one long giggle. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Blind optimism reigns supreme in Otto Harbach and Frank Mandel's book, a 
high-pitched Jazz Age farce that wasn't embarrassed by its fixation on the high 
life. "Go out and spend some money foolishly," advises rich Bible publisher 
Jimmy Smith (Gavin MacLeod of "Love Boat" fame). "Then you'll be happy." 
</P>
<P>
 As with everything else in "Nanette," Smith's comment is not meant ironically. 
The piece, the program notes inform us, is about "what was (in the 1920s) 
topical, slightly racy and mostly sheer fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-age Nanette (Elna Marie Binckes) grows restless under the tutelage of her 
guardians, the tycoon Smith and his frugal wife, Sue (Nanette Fabray). "I want 
to raise a family," the girl tells her suitor, a dull lawyer named Tom (Michael 
Dotson), "but I want to raise a little hell first." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, meanwhile, has been making some mischief of his own, giving cash gifts 
to attractive young women who imagine his interest in them is more than 
platonic (it isn't). For no very good reason, everyone winds up at the beach in 
Atlantic City as the show gives new meaning to the term "light opera." 
</P>
<P>
 Director and choreographer David Thome has staged this nonsense with the right 
amount of pluck, even if the show never quite reaches "Hellzapoppin" levels of 
giddiness. Due to the immense size of the Terrace Theater, the action is broad 
and heavily amplified. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is at its best when the cast members shut up and dance. The superb 
tap routine for "I Want to Be Happy," with Fabray and chorus, almost brings 
down the house, likewise the elaborate soft-shoe for the immortal "Tea for 
Two." Sean McMullin's period costumes -- flapper hats, pleated skirts, golf 
sweaters -- are pluses. 
</P>
<P>
 As a wisecracking maid, Kaye Ballard gets a lot of comic mileage out of a 
stock role. Fabray puts the right addled, oblivious spin on her aristocratic 
East Coast matron. MacLeod, who has an endearing way of talk-singing through 
numbers, is completely unconvincing as a slightly daffy tycoon. Which means, of 
course, that he's perfect for the part. 
</P>
<P>
 * "No, No, Nanette," Terrace Theater at the Long Beach Convention and 
Entertainment Center, 300 E. Ocean Blvd., Long Beach. Tuesday-Saturday, 8 p.m.; 
Saturday-Sunday, 2 p.m. Ends Sunday . (213) 365-3500. Running time: 2 hours and

MUSIC REVIEW; BRODSKY QUARTET RISES ABOVE DIN AT THE HOUSE OF BLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's probably safe to say that, before Sunday, the British-based Brodsky 
String Quartet had never performed in a venue draped with a corrugated metal 
exterior and dripping with high-tech low-funk-folk decor. One can also assume 
that string quartet aficionados don't normally haunt hip rock showcase clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the twain met when the Brodsky -- which attracted a pop following through 
its collaboration on Elvis Costello's song set "Juliet Letters" -- performed at 
the House of Blues. Playing all rock venues on their current tour, the group is 
pursuing a fine and noble ideal: bridging the gap between serious and popular 
musical presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, music appreciation became a chore due to ceaseless dinner crowd 
chatter, clangor from the kitchen and the inevitable sonic desecration of a 
string quartet pumped through a P.A. system. Nuance didn't stand a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, through the peripheral din, the unruffled quartet pulled off a 
divergent set. When whoops of appreciation followed its aptly feisty reading of 
Shostakovich, first violinist Michael Thomas responded "you're not supposed to 
say 'whoo.' You're supposed to say 'bravo.' " 
</P>
<P>
 As if playing to the venue, they relied on a mostly tonal, rhythmically driven 
repertory, apart from the program's most interesting work, the Polish Pawel 
Szymanski's fractured, neo-Baroque abstraction. Peter Sculthorpe's two pieces 
worked a fertile middle ground between head and heart. 
</P>
<P>
 The American segment included Copland, Gershwin and that other great American 
composer, Brian Wilson, whose Beach Boys tune "God Only Knows" enjoyed a 
sensitive arrangement. Later, we heard Barber's Adagio -- you know, the one 
from "Platoon." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas' own "Harold in Islington" found the violinist in perpetual motion over 
a grid of accents in a 5/4 meter. Here was an infectious brand of minimalism 
without the capital-M preciousness. JOSEF WOODARD

POP MUSIC REVIEW; YES: BOUNTIFUL SERVING OF ASTRO POP AND LOVE 'TALK' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the wake of Pink Floyd's Gargantuan stadium tour earlier this summer, Yes, 
another cosmically oriented classic-rock warhorse, has hit the road with its 
own smaller-scale, high-tech, quadraphonic production in tow. 
</P>
<P>
 For about 2 1/2 hours on Sunday at the Glen Helen Blockbuster Pavilion here, 
the band dished out a bountiful serving of its astro pop, sprinkling a handful 
of chestnuts throughout a show built primarily on its new album, "Talk," and 
1983's "90125." 
</P>
<P>
 At its best, on songs such as "Changes" and "Owner of a Lonely Heart," when 
guitarist Trevor Rabin takes charge and sends alternately crunching and 
swirling flourishes cutting through the strong, angelic harmonies, the band can 
still deliver an invigorating, uplifting escape from reality -- kind of like 
rock 'n' roll mood chimes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At its worst, when the band's Toto-ish tendencies grab hold and lead singer 
Jon Anderson's free spirit goes over the edge with talk of galactic love, one 
could only take solace in the fact that he stopped before asking the audience 
its collective astrological sign. And for those seated in a section of the 
audience where a special stereo mix could be received on portable radio 
headphones, there was always the option of switching to another channel. FRANK 
FARRAR * Yes appears Friday and Saturday at the Greek Theatre, 2700 N. Vermont 
Ave., 7:30 p.m., $15.50-$36.50. (213) 480-3232.

 Whether or not the weekend saw a box-office record--as early Sunday estimates 
suggested--business was big, with the top three movies in the Top 10 accounting 
for more than 60% of all the tickets sold. Counting all films that grossed more 
than $500,000--virtually all the business--$97.6 million in tickets were sold 
for Friday through Sunday, according to the box-office tracking firm Exhibitor 
Relations Co., whose formula had determined July 9-11, 1993, as the record 
weekend, when just under $100 million in tickets were sold.Other analysts, 
using different methods, are likely to report that a record was set--but 
barely. Weekend Box Office 04,31,18,10,10 Weekend Gross/ Screens/ Weeks in

'COMING OUT' DOCUMENTS WWII GAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arthur Dong's informative, consciousness-raising "Coming Out Under Fire" (at 
the Nuart Thursday through July 27) documents the experiences of nine gay and 
lesbian World War II veterans amid a plethora of archival footage and framed 
within the context of the recent and ongoing debate over gays in the military. 
</P>
<P>
 All the men and women state that they had no problems getting along with 
straights, many of whom assumed their sexual orientation and were not upset by 
it, but that they lived in constant fear of being denounced and subjected to 
the Draconian anti-gay regulations established early in the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Most left with well-earned honorable discharges, but several were not so 
fortunate, bearing scars from those experiences to this day. Yet if a gay male 
didn't lie to get into the service, the alternative was to be sent home bearing 
the stigma of "sexual pervert." 
</P>
<P>
 Dong, who based his film on Allan Berube's 1990 book of the same name, makes 
clear that World War II was the first time gays and lesbians were brought 
together in large numbers; this breaking down of isolation laid the foundation 
for the eventual gay liberation movement.

 To Austin for Music: In a thoroughly captivating, laid-back way Tara 
Veneruso's "Janis Joplin Slept Here" (presented Thursday by EZTV at RESOLUTION 
Gallery, 6518 Hollywood Blvd.) chronicles the last three decades or so in the 
amazingly vibrant, varied and enduring music scene of Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 In the course of interviewing, in a mere two hours, 74 musicians, artists' 
managers, club owners, DJs, critics and even a simpatico retired cop, Veneruso 
reminds us of what a major music capital Austin has long been. 
</P>
<P>
 "Janis Joplin Slept Here" makes you wish you had been to local landmark clubs, 
past and present, where you could enjoy everyone from Muddy Waters, the Sex 
Pistols, Johnny Winter, Bruce Springsteen ("when he was just a long name"), 
Stevie Ray Vaughn to Joplin herself -- not to mention scores more.

 Malcolm X Documentary: "Brother Minister: The Assassination of Malcolm X" (at 
the Sunset 5 at noon only for one week starting Friday) is a powder keg of a 
documentary directed by Jack Baxter, a former private investigator, who 
co-produced and co-wrote the film with Jefri Aalmuhammed, a Black Muslim who 
was a consultant on Spike Lee's "Malcolm X." 
</P>
<P>
 In a series of interviews with Malcolm X's colleagues, coupled with much 
potent and often rare archival materials, the filmmakers raise many unanswered 
questions surrounding the assassination of Malcolm X in February, 1965, in 
Harlem's Audubon Ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brother Minister" brings considerable clarity to an exceedingly complex, 
highly charged event, pointing a lot of fingers along the way and suggesting 
that the death of the ever-evolving Malcolm was a tragic loss to the ranks of 
African American leaders. At the very least, the film makes a strong case for a 
congressional investigation into Malcolm's assassination.

<P>
 Yukon Gold Rush: "The Trail of '98" (at the Silent Movie Friday and Saturday 
at 8 p.m.) is short on plot and characterization but is a knockout 1928 
spectacle, tracing with a documentary-like fidelity a grueling journey to the 
Klondike Gold Rush in the Yukon. Among those who endure blizzards, raging 
rivers, an avalanche and a climactic Dawson saloon fire are a stalwart Ralph 
Forbes, a demure Dolores Del Rio and a villainous Harry Carey. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, it takes 55 minutes for them just to get to Dawson, and not even skilled 
director Clarence Brown can make these lightly sketched characters come alive 
until the final two reels. What makes "The Trail of '98" worth seeing is the 
meticulously detailed authenticity of its production design, which includes 
even pre-earthquake footage of San Francisco's original Palace Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Carey Jr. will appear in person, to autograph his "Company of Heroes: My 
Life in the John Ford Stock Company."

THE WEEK AHEAD: MOSCOW; SOLZHENITSYN WINDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alexander I. Solzhenitsyn, the Nobel-prize winning writer, completing a nearly 
two-month tour across his native Russia, is scheduled to arrive in Moscow on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's greatest living writer is likely to be coming home cranky. When he 
returned to Vladivostok on May 27 after two decades in exile, he complained of 
the intrusive media that greeted him. Later, as he made his way across Russia, 
he complained that his trip was not being given the serious press coverage it 
deserved. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Solzhenitsyn has agreed to address the new Russian Duma, or lower 
house of Parliament, next fall.

THE WEEK AHEAD: WASHINGTON; OUT OF THE SHADOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The longest-running "secret diplomacy" in the Middle East comes in from the 
shadows Monday when Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel and King Hussein of 
Jordan meet at the White House for talks that President Clinton says will usher 
in a "new era" of regional peacemaking. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the last three decades, Hussein has met with a succession of 
Israeli prime ministers and foreign ministers to keep a lid on the simmering 
hostility across the longest Arab-Israeli border.But neither side publicly 
acknowledged the contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 Although U.S. officials do not expect Monday's meeting to lead directly to an 
Israel-Jordan peace treaty, the talks show that Hussein is prepared to move 
ahead in relations with Israel even if that angers Syrian President Hafez 
Assad, who is left isolated in his hard-line animosity toward the Israeli 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington was the site of last year's milestone in the Middle East peace 
process, the peace agreement signed by Rabin and Palestine Liberation 
Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat on the lawn of the White House.

NATIONAL AGENDA; SAUDI ARABIA'S EXILES CHALLENGE A CLOSED SOCIETY; THE 
DISSIDENTS WANT THE KINGDOM TO BE MORE DEMOCRATIC AND MORE ISLAMIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The latest and perhaps most dangerous challenge to the House of Saud is a 
portable telephone that Mohammed al Massari carries in his pocket around the 
fashionable hotel lobbies, restaurants and offices of London. 
</P>
<P>
 It rings every 10 minutes or so, and it's always a caller from somewhere in 
Saudi Arabia -- dialing through a New York exchange so the call can't be traced 
-- with tidbits of damaging gossip about the royal family, a report on the 
arrest of an opponent of the Saudi regime or simply a word of encouragement. 
"Thank you for what you're doing," said one caller from Riyadh on a recent 
afternoon. "We all support you." 
</P>
<P>
 Al Massari works for the Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights, whose 
office in London is a virtual guerrilla warfare center, a network of computers, 
files and fax machines that transmit reams of sedition into the remote desert 
kingdom, one of the most closed societies on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 The London operatives say 300 faxes a month go to Saudi government offices 
(the military was recently ordered to keep fax machines turned off unless a 
specific document was expected), and 300 more go to various merchants, 
intellectuals, businessmen and clerics who in turn copy them and re-fax them, 
in numbers totaling more than 100,000, throughout the kingdom; the committee 
claims, with great delight, to have recently acquired the number to the fax 
machine in the bedroom of Saudi Defense Minister Prince Sultan ibn Abdulaziz, 
brother of King Fahd. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Prince Sultan might have awakened to find these bits of 
propaganda at his bedside: that Saudi Arabia was secretly supplying the 
southern Yemenis with tanks and other military assistance in neighboring 
Yemen's civil war; that the number of pilgrims who died in an accident during 
the recent hajj pilgrimage was 10 times more than the government reported, or 
more than 2,200; that King Fahd and his brothers had in April received salary 
payments of 100 million Saudi riyals, about $27 million. 
</P>
<P>
 To the worry of both the Saudi monarchy and many Western governments, this 
particular opposition organization is an Islamic group bent on making the 
rigorously Islamic nation even more fundamentalist. Yet its calls for 
democratization and an end to corruption have attracted the interest of Saudi 
liberals pushing for greater freedom and public participation in government. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor are the committee's activities the only sign that not all is well in the 
kingdom, one of America's most important allies in the Arab world and its major 
partner in staging Operation Desert Storm, the 1991 war that drove Iraqi troops 
out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, two Saudi diplomats have gone into hiding in the United 
States, one from the Saudi consulate in Houston, the other posted to the Saudi 
mission at the United Nations in New York. Both are seeking political asylum 
and claiming harassment by the Saudi government. 
</P>
<P>
 "I join my voice to the increasing number of moderate academics from our great 
nation who are no longer able to tolerate the breaches of basic human rights, 
including the right to freedom of expression and political association, by the 
present regime in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia," said Ahmed al Zahrany, second 
secretary at the consulate in Houston, in an announcement in late June. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohammed al Khilewi, the U.N. envoy, in a letter to Saudi Arabia's senior 
cleric, Sheik Abdulaziz ibn Baz, began his announcement of opposition with a 
quotation from a Koranic verse that has been frequently circulated in 
underground cassette tapes in Saudi Arabia, to the fury of the royal regime: 
"Kings, when they enter a country, despoil it, and make the noblest of its 
people its meanest; thus do they behave." 
</P>
<P>
 Khilewi said that within hours of sending the letter he received a phone call 
from the Saudi ambassador in Washington, Prince Bandar ibn Sultan, offering to 
send his private jet to take him to Washington, where they would discuss the 
issue in a private suite at the Watergate Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based upon my experience, I understood this to be an attempt to kidnap me and 
return me to Saudi Arabia for the treatment accorded to vocal opponents of the 
regime," Khilewi said in a statement to the press after he went into hiding. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition to the House of Saud has simmered off and on for years, especially 
in the hot desert north of Riyadh where Saudi Arabia's most radical clerics 
hold sway. But in the years since the end of the Persian Gulf War, opposition 
to the regime has reached unprecedented levels, mostly invisible because so few 
Western observers are granted visas to visit the kingdom, a number of Saudi 
analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the U.S. government is mistaken to underestimate the degree of 
support for the Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights and the extent 
of opposition in Saudi Arabia. There has been a sea change just in the past 
year," said Aziz abu Hamad, a Saudi who studies human rights issues in the 
kingdom for Human Rights Watch, a U.S.-based organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have talked to many people in Saudi Arabia, and I am convinced there are 
many people in Saudi who support more radical means to achieve the Islamist 
goals," Hamad said. "Some of them discuss the Committee for the Defense of 
Legitimate Rights as too optimistic about the possibility of change without 
violence." 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, the idea of militant fundamentalists in a country whose 
Islamic practices are already the most rigorous in the world is a bit 
confusing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saud family's power comes by way of a historic alliance with the 
fundamentalist Wahhabi sect of Islam. But the new wave of Islamists in Saudi 
Arabia, joined by more militant Islamic voices in neighboring Egypt, Jordan and 
Algeria, claim Saudi Arabia is practicing a false brand of Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 Islamic critics are happy enough that the Saudi Arabian monarchy requires the 
veiling of women, bans alcohol and intermingling of the sexes and prohibits 
women from driving. But they are critical of Saudi economic policies that allow 
interest on banking (considered usury by the Koran, Islam's holy book), too 
heavy a dependence on the West in foreign, defense and economic policy and a 
legal system that is not fully based on the Islamic Sharia law. 
</P>
<P>
 Like more liberal critics of the regime, they are demanding an end to 
inefficiency and corruption in the government administration and to the 
continuing favoritism toward members of the royal family. 
</P>
<P>
 Saad al Faqih, London office director of the committee, complained that the 
Saudi government has attempted to lump the whole opposition movement with 
fanatics. 
</P>
<P>
 "They try to confuse the fundamentalists and the new educated Islamists. I 
will not accept to be labeled as backward and without culture," said Faqih, a 
medical professor and surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is they have a lot which does not fit in with Islamic teachings, 
especially things that have to do with the relationship between power and the 
people. . . . I believe we have achieved our aim of telling the people that 
Islam does not justify a political dictatorship." 
</P>
<P>
 The Saudi regime reacted with immediate alarm when the committee was formed 
inside the kingdom in May, 1993 -- with some cause. For instance, one member of 
the new committee, subsequently suspended, was a sheik who advocated killing 
the country's Shiite Muslims. (The majority of Saudis, and the ruling family, 
are Sunni Muslims.) 
</P>
<P>
 The London-based Massari, now the group's official spokesman and son of a 
senior cleric in Saudi Arabia, says he was awakened at 2:30 one morning when 
his front door was broken down by a group of police officers. The officers 
rushed up to the bedroom with pistols drawn and took him away handcuffed and 
blindfolded. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every day during the next six months, Massari says, he was beaten with 
a bamboo cane on the back and feet. Officers would spit in his face, pull on 
his beard and call him a "criminal insect." 
</P>
<P>
 Massari, then a professor of theoretical physics at Riyadh's King Saud 
University, was later joined in prison by 12 other professors. Six members of 
the group lost their government jobs, and the detainees were released from 
prison only after signing statements promising to undertake no other campaigns 
against the government. 
</P>
<P>
 That is when they began quietly plotting to leave the country, Massari said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly thereafter, the committee announced it had opened shop in London. 
Nearly a dozen of Massari's relatives and associates in the kingdom, including 
his 19-year-old son, have since been arrested. Faqih's wife has been forbidden 
to travel outside the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition leaders claim the United States stays largely silent about human 
rights issues in Saudi Arabia because it fears encouraging Islamic 
fundamentalism and because Saudi Arabia has become an increasingly important 
trading partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Mabus, the former Mississippi governor recently confirmed as ambassador to 
Riyadh, said contracts worth more than $10 billion have been announced in the 
past few months between U.S. companies and Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
 "These contracts are going to have an enormous impact on our economy and will 
create or save thousands of American jobs," Mabus said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) raised the issue during Mabus' 
confirmation hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will make a huge go-round about Kashmir and India, and Tian An Men Square 
and China, and pay no heed whatsoever to what is surely the most autocratic 
regime on Earth," Moynihan complained. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saudis have been largely officially silent on the issue, though Prince 
Bandar, the ambassador to Washington, in a recent newspaper commentary 
cautioned the West against intervening in issues it perhaps cannot understand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We come from an almost timeless culture and firmly hold to our religious 
faith. Islam for us is not just a religion but a way of life," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "We Saudis want to modernize, but not necessarily Westernize. . . . It does 
not help King Fahd, for example, to look good in the Washington Post . . . but 
not to work within the overwhelming consensus in downtown Riyadh and the rest 
of Saudi Arabia," Bandar wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Western human rights or other politically correct groups here may want 
doesn't help King Fahd at all when the Saudi people have a strong differing 
view of their own, based on Islam and other basic ways," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have to like all America does, and it doesn't have to like all that 
we do."

THE WEEK AHEAD: BERLIN; A PLOT THAT FAILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a year of mostly uncomfortable World War II anniversaries, Germany 
celebrates one with pride: the 50th anniversary of the July 20, 1944, attempt 
to assassinate Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
 Chancellor Helmut Kohl will give a speech Wednesday to mark the day that 
military officers placed a bomb in Hitler's East Prussian headquarters. It 
killed four people and destroyed the headquarters, but Hitler survived. 
</P>
<P>
 The commemoration is surrounded by controversy. For instance, the son of the 
plot's leader is upset that a Berlin exhibition on the German resistance to 
Hitler includes activities of the Communist underground. 
</P>
<P>
 The government is issuing a commemorative 10-mark coin to note the anniversary 
of the failed plot.

INSIDER; U.N. LEADER MAY BE DIGGING IN HIS HEELS; BOUTROS-GHALI'S PLAN TO KEEP 
POST IRKS WASHINGTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 U.N. diplomats and officials -- who couldn't believe the news at first -- are 
now convinced that 71-year-old Boutros Boutros-Ghali is serious about seeking a 
second term as secretary general of the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision is worrisome in Washington. A reelection bid by the moody, 
stubborn Egyptian diplomat could lead to a confrontation with the Clinton 
Administration. In fact, relations are so bad that U.S. Ambassador Madeleine 
Albright would probably veto his candidacy if the election were held in the 
Security Council today. But Boutros-Ghali is only midway through his five-year 
term, and American moods may change by the time the council votes at the end of 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretary general's announced intentions have also caused consternation 
among government officials, diplomats and others who were hoping that the 
Security Council would set up an orderly process next year for selecting a 
secretary general. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the United Nations will mark its 50th anniversary in 1995, they suggest, 
the celebrations could put everyone in a mood for exploring ideas to improve 
the world body -- including agreement on a more rational way of selecting 
candidates for the top job. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's very hard to do that when you have an incumbent who has indicated 
several years in advance that he wants to continue in office," said Edward 
Luck, president of the U.N. Assn., a private organization. "It puts a damper on 
the process. What better time than the 50th anniversary to have a serious 
discussion of the office of the secretary general. But we are not going to get 
it because people don't want to offend the incumbent." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, ambassadors to the Security Council, which selects the secretary 
general and then submits the nominee to the General Assembly for predictably 
automatic approval, have often fretted over a choice until the last minute. An 
array of candidates, often obscure, are put forward by their governments or, 
sometimes, self-nominated. The Security Council ambassadors know little if 
anything of many candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last election, President George Bush, rebuffed over his first choice, 
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, was still looking for another candidate 
when the Security Council settled on Boutros-Ghali. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Security Council picked him in late 1991, Boutros-Ghali told everyone 
that, unlike his five predecessors, he would leave office after one term. All 
the others stood successfully for a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 The Egyptian's single-term pledge allowed him to brandish his independence. He 
did not have to kowtow to the United States and the other veto-powered 
governments just to win their support for a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of the attractive things about him," said a European ambassador on 
the Security Council. "He could say, 'I'm not dependent on anyone, I don't have 
to work at the pleasure of others.' This was very effective." 
</P>
<P>
 But Boutros-Ghali startled a news conference in May by declaring that he might 
seek a second five-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question will be raised in 1996," he said, "and it will depend on my 
physical capacities. If I am feeling in shape, quite honestly, I will say yes. 
On the other hand . . . if I don't feel well enough, then I won't request a 
second term." Asked what had prompted him to change his mind, the secretary 
general replied, "I believe that only stupid people don't change their mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Some diplomats at first thought this must be a ploy. Boutros-Ghali, they 
reasoned, did not want to be treated as a lame duck in his last 2 1/2 years on 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
 But the word soon spread from his offices on the 38th floor of the secretariat 
that the secretary general was serious about reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has put his health as a shield before him," another European ambassador 
said. "If he is not sure of being reelected, he can always bring up his health 
and say he is not up to running again. He is using his health as a face-saving 
device, and, to me, that means he's serious." 
</P>
<P>
 Except for a bout of knee trouble -- attributed to gout -- late last year, the 
frail-looking Boutros-Ghali has not been slowed by any illness in his first 30 
months on the job. But the secretary general is known as a workaholic who has 
little time for socializing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen not one single theater, not one single movie, not one single 
orchestra in my 2 1/2 years in New York," he said recently. "I am a monk." Some 
diplomats wonder if he can keep up the same pace when he is in his mid-70s. 
</P>
<P>
 After Boutros-Ghali told the news conference that he might seek a second term, 
James P. Rubin, Ambassador Albright's press attache, spoke carefully when 
questioned by reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Secretary General Boutros-Ghali has had a challenging job of moving the 
United Nations into the post-Cold War period," he said. "We have worked closely 
with him and will continue to do so during the remaining 2 1/2 years of his 
current term. He has not formally announced his candidacy for a second term." 
</P>
<P>
 The polite, noncommittal words, however, hid a seething reality. 
</P>
<P>
 American officials have fought with Boutros-Ghali over policies on Somalia, 
Israel, Rwanda, Haiti and other issues. They believe that Boutros-Ghali has 
tried to wield an executive power to which he has no right. Some insist that 
the Clinton Administration will veto his candidacy if he dares to seek 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali shrugs off this kind of talk. Another confrontation with the 
U.S. government does not frighten him. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts, in fact, believe Boutros-Ghali has already assured himself 
renewed support from France, one of his original sponsors, for his support of 
the French intervention in Rwanda. In a similar way, an ambassador pointed out 
recently, he might put all his prestige behind an American intervention in 
Haiti, a move that could change some American minds about him. 
</P>
<P>
 But the secretary general is a stubborn man who does not intend to lose his 
independence -- even if he does run again.

ETHNIC DISCORD; BACK TO SUDETENLAND?; THE PRESSURE IS BUILDING ON CZECHS TO 
RETURN HOMES AND PROPERTY THEY SEIZED FROM GERMANS AFTER WORLD WAR II OR TO AT 
LEAST COMPENSATE THE VICTIMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Baroque central square of this charming border town is a hub of German 
tourism and Czech Angst.  
</P>
<P>
 Across from the town hall, visiting Germans frequent a bookshop in Haus von 
Gruener, the home of Cheb's Sudeten German mayor before he was expelled with 
38,000 other residents after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they come in and demand maps in German with the local names the way they 
used to be, that's an indicator of something," bookseller Irena Schulzova said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Schulzova, whose hybrid last name is testimony to the region's bicultural 
history, the sought-after maps are symbolic of Sudeten German desires to take 
back the Czech borderlandproperties that were confiscated from them after the 
war. Her answer is to keep only Czech-language maps in stock. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were more Germans in this town than Czechs, and if the Germans came 
back now, where would we Czechs be? It would be absolute chaos," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 2.5 million Sudeten Germans were stripped of their Czech 
citizenship and properties and expelled from the country after Nazi Germany was 
defeated in 1945. Thousands were beaten and killed in a riot of revenge for 
Adolf Hitler's annexation of the border region preceding World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 What was then termed the Sudetenland became the mark of Western appeasement of 
the Nazi leader, cemented in the 1938 Munich Pact in which Britain and France 
agreed to the annexation. Six months later Nazi forces swallowed all of 
Czechoslovakia and in 1940 invaded Poland, triggering the world war. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the collapse of communism, Sudeten German representatives in Bavaria 
have been pressing for the return of their properties. Recently their call was 
taken up by high-ranking German officials -- a worrisome development to the 
residents of Cheb. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Sudeten German congress in Nuremberg in May, German Interior Minister 
Manfred Kanther said the Czech government should seek reconciliation with the 
expelled Germans. Finance Minister Theo Waigel linked support for the Czech 
Republic's bid to join the European Union to concessions on the Sudetens. (The 
former Czechoslovakia has been split into independent Slovakia and the Czech 
Republic.) 
</P>
<P>
 But the German government has not officially linked the two issues, and many 
German and Czech officials suggest that the high-level comments were campaign 
rhetoric to win Sudeten votes for the ruling German coalition in the October 
federal election. They also say the vast majority of Sudetens have no desire to 
return to the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 But the issue remains deeply emotional on both sides of the border. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is not whether a hundred, a thousand or a hundred thousand 
Sudetens would go back," said Franz Neubauer, leader of the Sudetendeutsche 
Landsmannschaft, an organization of expelled Sudetens that claims 100,000 
members. "What is important is that the Czechs say this was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Neubauer says his group wants dual citizenship, which neither country 
recognizes, and to discuss property rights with the Czech government. He is 
calling on the Czech government in Prague to abolish a 1946 confiscation decree 
by President Eduard Benes issued to punish Sudeten Germans for their role in 
the Nazi occupation, and says the Sudetens would consider restitution or 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 In a controversial speech on New Year's Day, 1990, Czech President Vaclav 
Havel actually did apologize for the mass expulsion and said the Sudetens 
should not be burdened with "collective guilt" for those who fought on the side 
of the Nazis and helped the occupation of Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
 But he stopped short of raising the land issue, and Czech restitution laws 
limit return of properties to those confiscated after the Communist takeover in 
1948. Sudeten lands are excluded. 
</P>
<P>
 In a region that has suffered so much turmoil, many Czech citizens say Havel 
opened a can of worms and are adamant that the land issue be laid to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think no one doubts that the laws we have now for restitution of property 
confiscated after '48 should be final," said Lubomir Novotny, deputy mayor of 
nearby Sokolov. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we go before that, then we would have to talk about restitution from 
Germany (for Nazi crimes). And if we went so far back into history, we'd have 
to go back to 1648 when the Swedes invaded Prague," Novotny said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Sudetens were expelled, most of their houses were occupied by Czechs 
or torn down; their lands were occupied or confiscated by the government. Like 
many border residents, Novotny tells a story of a Sudeten German arriving 
unexpectedly at the door of his house one day in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "A German car stopped, a man and a woman got out. He said he was 9 when he had 
to leave and wanted to show her where he was born. He said outright he lives in 
Stuttgart and just came to see where he spent his childhood," Novotny said. 
</P>
<P>
 From that, Novotny concludes that most Sudetens would not want to return. Cheb 
Mayor Frantisek Linda agrees and would object to any compensation from the 
Czech government to the Sudetens. But he also blames the former Communist 
government for having incited anti-German feelings, and, rather than dwell on 
the past, he prefers to emphasize cooperation among Czechs and Germans at a 
border that burst open in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheb sits about five miles from the German border. Daily, Germans cross over 
to the Czech Republic to shop for goods less expensive than those they can find 
at home, to get their hair cut, to have an afternoon coffee and cake. Cheb's 
central square is surrounded by currency exchange houses and signs in German. 
</P>
<P>
 German influence is again so strong -- and so touchy -- that the local 
newspaper, Chebsky Denik, recently ran a cartoon of a Czech vendor whose 
billboards were all written in German. "I'd be as patriotic as they come if 
Czechs just paid in D-marks," the vendor says. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Czechs suggest that the Sudetens have become more aggressive on the land 
issue since the split of Czechoslovakia into two countries a year and a half 
ago; now they are up against a smaller country. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Germans say the problem has been overblown by politicians far from the 
border. Edita Danesova, 62, whose German family remained in Czechoslovakia 
after the war, said "the tough years were '45 and '46" but that the two groups 
have long since made peace. 
</P>
<P>
 At the sweet shop where she works in Sokolov, Danesova meets many German 
tourists and says she doubts many would abandon Germany for the poorer Czech 
Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cheb, bookseller Schulzova says she understands Czech-German sensitivities 
as well as anyone: Her grandfather was Czech and her grandmother German. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the war started, it was bad for my grandfather and they moved inland. 
After the war, it was bad for my grandmother, so they came back here again," 
Schulzova said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, she holds fast to the Czech mainstream, which says that Cheb must 
remain Czech.

DOING BUSINESS; HOLY ALLIANCE GETS A VENTURE FLOWING; A CALIFORNIA ENTREPRENEUR 
AND A RUSSIAN ARCHBISHOP TEAM UP TO TAP SPRING WATER FOR SALE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN GUTTERMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What's clear, comes in a bottle and is one of the few Russian products that 
can compete on the world market? 
</P>
<P>
 No, it's not vodka, it's voda -- plain old water. 
</P>
<P>
 So say the producers of Saint Springs, an upscale bottled spring water whose 
source is an unorthodox joint venture between a retired California plastics man 
and the Russian archbishop of Kostroma and Galich. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it a holy alliance, call it a blessed business partnership. John V. R. 
King, the Lake Arrowhead entrepreneur who hopes to strike it rich selling 
Russian water, calls it a Russian business miracle. 
</P>
<P>
 King, 58, met Archbishop Alexander during a 1992 sightseeing cruise on the 
Volga River. The young cleric was angling for money to rebuild the crumbling 
churches of his diocese, seated 200 miles northeast of Moscow in Kostroma. He 
gave King the time-worn Russian spiel to foreigners -- the old story of having 
unlimited resources and ideas, but just needing a shot of das kapital to bring 
it all together. 
</P>
<P>
 At first King, 10 years into a comfortable retirement, was wary. "Then he 
mentioned springs," King recalled. "I didn't sleep at all that night." 
</P>
<P>
 The dreams that kept King up have now sprung to life, with the help of what he 
says is a multimillion-dollar sum from 17 U.S. investors, many of them friends 
from Lake Arrowhead. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, 1.5-liter bottles from the factory -- the only plant in Russia to 
make PET plastic bottles except those of soft drink giants Coca-Cola and 
Pepsico -- hit supermarket shelves and hotel bars in Moscow and St. Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
 King said that while the water meets or exceeds international standards, the 
bottle is Saint Springs' prime selling point. Designed by a team headed by one 
of the investors, Napa Valley winery owner Neil Knott, the bottle has an 
onion-domed shape, and its costly clear-plastic label sports a drawing of an 
old wooden church and Archbishop Alexander's official seal. The bottle is made 
with the PET (polyethylene terephthelate) recycling process. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it unholy for the church to be taking part in such a venture? 
</P>
<P>
 Patriarch Alexi II, leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, apparently doesn't 
think so: He blessed the springs earlier this year, and in February promoted 
Alexander, 37, from bishop to archbishop, making him the youngest of 40 Russian 
clergymen who hold the lofty rank. 
</P>
<P>
 While King hopes to strike it rich, Archbishop Alexander said his motives are 
as pure as the water. It is unclear exactly how potential profits will be 
divided. King said the church "will realize financial benefits in 1994." 
Alexander insisted that "all profits" from the venture will go to rebuild the 
infrastructure of the Kostroma diocese, repairing the ravages that took place 
under communism. 
</P>
<P>
 The archbishop said the diocese -- population 850,000 -- had about 1,200 
houses of worship before the 1917 revolution but emerged from more than seven 
decades of official atheism with just 70 churches intact. 
</P>
<P>
 By blessing the springs -- and the factory itself, as he will in the official 
ribbon-cutting ceremony Friday -- Alexi II lends spiritual support to an effort 
to carve out a niche for a Russian product in Western-dominated markets. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Russian Orthodox Church has given Saint Springs more than its 
blessing. 
</P>
<P>
 King said the church has been "the ideal partner," a skilled navigator on the 
murky waters of Russian business, where numbing bureaucracy and profit-gouging 
taxes lurk just beneath a surface solicitation of foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The church is in a position of growing power and influence in Russia, and 
they have been instrumental in getting this project where it has gotten," King 
said. "Russian laws often contradict each other. When we needed to do something 
at variance with the law, they were able to get an exception made." 
</P>
<P>
 But King said there were fewer problems than he had expected, and the partners 
managed to get the plant up and running within budget, if not quite within the 
time frame he had originally set. 
</P>
<P>
 King said he originally looked for investment to the Overseas Private 
Investment Corp. and other U.S. government foundations that support 
entrepreneurial activity in Russia but decided to go it alone after running 
into "red tape and delays worse than anything we've seen in Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 At first, King worried that the water's Russian origin would be a sales 
obstacle. A recent study by the Russian Environment Ministry found that a third 
of the country's 148 million citizens get sick every year from drinking water 
tainted by pollution, dirty pipes and old purification facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 But the question has rarely come up with buyers. For Aeroflot, which will be 
serving Saint Springs water exclusively on international flights from Moscow's 
Sheremetyevo airport beginning Aug. 1, the Russian factor is a positive one. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked at a lot of waters, and Saint Springs was the best," said Daniel 
Souders, domestic purchasing director for Aeromar, which caters most flights 
out of Moscow. "No. 1, the quality, and No. 2 -- it's Russian." 
</P>
<P>
 King said Delta, the only U.S. airline with direct flights to Moscow and St. 
Petersburg, had expressed interest, and that New York's legendary Russian Tea 
Room had placed an order.  
</P>
<P>
 Jari Ahde, the manager of alcohol and waters at a Moscow branch of the Finnish 
store Stockmann, was less gung-ho about sales. He said Saint Springs is 
competitively priced at $1.80 for 1.5 liters -- 55 cents less than Evian and a 
little more than two Finnish brands -- but that it would take some time to 
erode customers' loyalty to the Western brands they are used to. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have to understand that there can be a good water made here too," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 King is confident that consumers will respond, and he is ready to expand.  
</P>
<P>
 He said that by next winter, Saint Springs water will begin flowing into U.S. 
markets with large Russian-speaking communities, such as Los Angeles, San 
Francisco and New York.

PROFILE; SADDAM'S PUBLIC ENEMY NO. 1; KURDISH LEADER AHMED CHALABI HAS LIVED 
MANY LIVES, FROM MATHEMATICIAN TO FALLEN BANKER TO FEARLESS FOE OF IRAQ'S 
DICTATOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It takes some nerve to set yourself up as the No. 1 enemy of Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein. To do so while living openly just 200 miles north of Baghdad 
would seem to be inviting an assassin's bullet, if not a Scud missile.  
</P>
<P>
 But a smile never seems to be far from the lips of Ahmed Chalabi, who takes in 
stride his many roles as brilliant mathematician, fallen Jordanian banker and 
principal opposition coordinator against the Arab world's most ruthless regime. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not in exile. We're here," the 49-year-old Chalabi said proudly, 
relaxing at midnight in designer trousers and a sweat shirt in his luxurious 
home in the mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan, picking fruit from a low table piled 
high with fresh watermelons, peaches and cucumbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Chalabi has indeed made his mark in Iraq. He is credited with a major role in 
averting civil war in May between factions of the 3.5 million ethnic Kurds 
living in the north. An all-out conflict would have wrecked their democratic 
experiment and gravely embarrassed the United States and Western allies who 
have protected them from Hussein's forces since the Persian Gulf War ended in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Chalabi did not act alone; foreign relief agencies also mediated between the 
rival Kurdish leaderships. But both sides testify to his bravery in heading 
into front lines where battles were in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to have the strength of your convictions. You can't ask people to 
risk lives unless they see you are ready to do it," Chalabi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, Chalabi's peacemaking efforts made a name for the Iraqi 
National Congress (INC), the otherwise obscure umbrella group of organizations 
fighting to oust Hussein. Their white-and-green flag is now a common sight on 
peacekeeping checkpoints, its three interlocking circles symbolizing the three 
main communities of Iraq: Sunni Muslims, Shiite Muslims and the Kurds. 
</P>
<P>
 Three well-known leaders of these communities were elected as a leadership 
council at the INC's first congress in the old mountain resort town of 
Salahuddin in 1992. Chalabi, the INC's mentor, was appointed president of the 
executive council to run the group from day to day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chalabi started the (intra-Kurdish) mediation initiative. There was nobody 
else. Everybody was listening to him," said Ferman Jabbar, a military leader of 
the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, a member of the INC and also one of the two 
main factions feuding for power in Iraqi Kurdistan. (Kurdistan spans parts of 
Iraq, Iran, Syria, Turkey and territories of the former Soviet Union but hasn't 
achieved independence in modern times.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Arab radios are now talking about the INC. The mediation showed they can do 
something," said Sami Abdulrahman, who leads the other faction, the Kurdish 
Democratic Party, also an INC founding group. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no doubting Chalabi's winning mix of intelligence, charm and 
organizational ability. He commands the same warm respect from a beefy warlord 
like Jabbar, who favors a Serb-style forage cap and keeps pet eagles, as from 
bearded Muslim activists in charge of groups like the Revolutionary Kurdish 
Hezbollah. 
</P>
<P>
 Integrity is a more slippery subject in this atmosphere, where all have a gun 
in their belt and an enemy not far away. Chalabi declines to answer questions 
about how he funds an organization with photocopiers, TV studios and 
walkie-talkie radios on the hip of every staffer. He denied the widespread 
belief that he gets covert U.S. funding. 
</P>
<P>
 His intra-Kurdish mediation, however, has won him official Western approval. 
Chalabi proudly showed off faxed letters from Britain's Foreign Office and the 
U.S. State Department. The INC's mediation was "a welcome contribution," said 
Peter Tarnoff, the State Department's undersecretary of state for political 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Chalabi has come a long way in winning trust from the West since 1989, when 
Petra Bank, the second-biggest bank in Jordan with $1.4 billion in loans, came 
spectacularly unglued under his presidency. A year later it was closed down. 
Jordanian Central Bank Gov. Muhammed Said Nabulsi accused Chalabi of "fraud, 
embezzlement and illicit transactions." 
</P>
<P>
 Chalabi fled Jordan but was never formally charged. The bank affair remains 
mysterious. Chalabi says he had been feeding information to the West about 
Saddam Hussein's arms-buying ploys, and he maintains the bankruptcy was all an 
Iraqi plot mixed with Jordanian palace politics.  
</P>
<P>
 "In the end, it was too hard to have one's own country against one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He should know. Chalabi was born into a prominent Baghdad Shiite Muslim 
family: His father was president of the old Iraqi Senate, and his grandfather 
was a long-serving education minister. But the family was forced to leave Iraq 
in the 1950s during the revolutionary ferment that eventually led to Saddam 
Hussein's takeover. 
</P>
<P>
 Chalabi then studied mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
before earning his doctorate at the University of Chicago. He was teaching at 
the American University of Beirut, he says, when the Jordanian crown prince 
invited him to Amman to found Petra Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Chalabi appears to enjoy and excel in the high-stakes skills of Middle 
Eastern leadership: coaxing feuding factions into making peace and, failing 
that, dealing with war. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel, for instance, is never without a cavalcade of four-wheel-drive 
battlewagons loaded with weaponry. His chief aide was an Iraqi secret agent in 
Paris before changing sides. The INC's offices, a television studio bristling 
with antennas and an INC guest house, have gradually moved into more and more 
houses in Salahuddin. 
</P>
<P>
 The INC has set up two training camps to receive groups of Iraqi army 
defectors and local Kurdish recruits, who total perhaps 750 soldiers. Some are 
now serving on checkpoints dividing the front lines, but many are new to the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more unusual is Chalabi's headquarters. His warren of offices is packed 
with armed retainers, satellite telephones, the latest computers and schematic 
flow-charts of Iraqi army divisions in the north. Chalabi claims some of the 
best inside knowledge of the Iraqi officer corps. 
</P>
<P>
 He is particularly delighted with one prank cooked up in Salahuddin: the 
publication and distribution in Baghdad of a spoof edition of the Iraqi 
newspaper Babel. Looking superficially just like the original, the news columns 
gave details of Hussein's human-rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
 The INC staff members are young, bright and enthusiastic, but for all their 
energy, the organization remains something of a one-man show. Masoud Barzani, 
chief of the Kurdish Democratic Party and tribal leader of hundreds of 
thousands of Kurds, noted: "The INC's role is very great, but it alone cannot 
do very much." 
</P>
<P>
 Kamran Karadaghi, a leading commentator on Iraqi affairs for the London 
newspaper Al Hayat, said Chalabi's very success was generating jealousy within 
the INC. At the best of times, the group can only just hold together rival 
wings that range from Islamists to Communists, backed by all the feuding states 
in the Middle Eastern kaleidoscope.  
</P>
<P>
 Chalabi denies that he is after Hussein's job or anything more than the INC's 
official aim -- to oust Hussein and bring democracy to Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
 The former banker did a quick calculation: Iraq owes $100 billion to Western 
banks and governments, faces claims of $240 billion in war indemnities from 
Kuwait, and Iran claims $900 billion more in damages for the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq 
War. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's as much as all the oil in Iraq is worth," Chalabi said. "Anyone who 
wants to take power in Baghdad is crazy. I am just in this to get rid of 
Saddam." Biography

AMERICA FROM ABROAD; A BRITISH MUSEUM BOWS TO COLONIES; THE STATELY 
19TH-CENTURY MANSION IN BATH DISPLAYS U.S. DECORATIVE ARTS AND HISTORY BY THE 
ROOMFUL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The setting couldn't be more British: a graceful late Georgian mansion on a 
hill overlooking the majestic valley of the Avon River. But inside, Claverton 
Manor is All-American. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the home of the American Museum in Britain, which bills itself as the 
largest collection of Americana outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum portrays the decorative arts of early America, illustrating 
domestic life in the United States from Colonial times to the eve of the Civil 
War. 
</P>
<P>
 "People here are able to gain an idea of the achievement of early American 
arts and craftsmanship," says its director, William McNaught. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum was founded in 1961 by Dallas Pratt and John Judkyn, two Americans 
with a desire to bring to British attention the quality of life in early 
America and to foster better understanding between the countries. They bought 
the three-story Claverton Manor, which was designed by Sir Jeffry Wyatville, 
architect to King George IV, and built in the 1820s of Bath stone just east of 
Bath. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the museum has continually added to its collection, which is 
arranged as a series of period rooms fitted with original furniture, paneling 
and floorboards from houses in the United States. It is filled with silverware, 
pewter, glass, rugs, quilts and ceramics. 
</P>
<P>
 Dispersed through the 125-acre grounds are outdoor displays, including 
transportation exhibits and a milliner's shop, a Colonial herb garden and a 
replica of George Washington's garden at his home in Mount Vernon, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two galleries on the grounds: one featuring folk art and the other, 
the New Gallery, housing a map collection and a library used by the public for 
research. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, about 16,000 British schoolchildren, drawn from a 200-mile radius, 
troop through the grounds, according to the American-born Countess of Airlie, a 
museum trustee. 
</P>
<P>
 "They absorb some idea of what we produced in the way of culture in the 18th 
and 19th centuries, that we weren't just rustics," she says. "There's nowhere 
else in Britain or Europe where you can get this experience -- American life at 
its beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think one of the museum's most valuable assets is as a teaching 
institution. There is very little American history taught in British schools." 
</P>
<P>
 On entering, the visitor climbs a circular staircase to the first period 
chamber: the 17th-Century keeping room, typical of those inhabited by New 
England colonists and a major improvement on the rough cabins of the first 
settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Each room has a volunteer guide, and here Patricia Gale points out a small 
pedestal table. "That," she says, "is believed to have been owned by Peregrine 
White, who was born aboard the Mayflower in 1620 when the Pilgrim ship was 
moored in Cape Cod Bay -- the first male colonist born in New England." 
</P>
<P>
 The entry hall features two items that underscore the settlers' precarious 
existence: a sturdy front door with iron strap hinges, secured at night by a 
wooden bar; and the homespun linen "valuables bag" made to hold documents and 
prized articles, kept within easy reach in case of fire or Indian attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Next comes the Lee Room, named for an early 18th-Century house in Lee, N. H., 
that was painted blue-green using a mixture of skimmed milk and fresh slaked 
lime. The furnishings show a more sophisticated look than the first rooms. An 
adjunct is the Borning Room from the same date, so called because it was used 
for childbirth and closed off as a "measles room" during illness. 
</P>
<P>
 The visitor next enters the Perley Parlor, a handsome room of a wealthy 
colonist during the period of growing friction with the mother country. Its 
pine paneling is from a house built around 1763 in Boxford, Mass., by Capt. 
William Perley, a leader of the local militiamen who led them into action at 
the battle of Bunker Hill in 1775. 
</P>
<P>
 The Textile Room boasts a brilliant collection of 18th- and 19th-Century 
hooked rugs and quilts, relics of the American "quilting bees," which were 
social events as well as a frugal way of recycling old clothes. Hung on racks 
are about 40 large quilts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are fascinated," says an American visitor, Ivy DiPiero, traveling with her 
husband, Ivo, from McComb, Ill. "We've been to Bath before, but we never came 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Another room, the Stenciled Bedchamber, is named for the journeymen decorators 
who provided householders with a wallpaper substitute in the form of stenciled 
wall designs. Even the bed coverlet has a stenciled motif. Beside the 
four-poster is a stenciled rocking chair made by Lambert Hitchcock of 
Connecticut, the first American to use mass production for inexpensive 
furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum, which has a whaling exhibition that includes an actual captain's 
cabin, then departs from the East Coast with a display of the rivers and ships 
that aided the movement westward, tied in with the North American Indians who 
were displaced by the pioneers. Cowboys and Indians are depicted in lively 
displays that include saloon life and bronzes by Frederic Remington and Harry 
Andrew Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Unusually, there is a New Mexico living room, which reflects the heritage of 
the Spanish colonists in America who built in the native Pueblo Indian adobe. 
To the side is a tiny Morada chapel belonging to the Penitente Brotherhood, a 
Catholic laymen's group. It is equipped with a crucifix and religious statues. 
</P>
<P>
 You then come across a chronological throwback: Conkey's Tavern, the original 
farmhouse tavern built in 1758 by William Conkey in Pelham, Mass. Outside the 
room hangs the old tavern sign, and above the huge fireplace is a lintel 
inscribed at the time of the tavern's extension in 1776. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this room, Capt. Daniel Shays plotted his unsuccessful rebellion against 
the government of Massachusetts in 1786," guide Peter Arnold says. 
</P>
<P>
 The last two rooms are representative of the affluent new nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greek Revival Room, based on a New York City dining room circa 1830, has 
Duncan Phyfe furniture arranged for an after-theater party with music provided 
by the harp and piano, brass flute, clarinet and Spanish guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there's the New Orleans Bedroom, an opulent chamber from a Louisiana 
plantation house featuring a large-scale, carved mahogany bed -- with a 
mosquito net -- adapted from the Louis XV style by Prudent Mallard, who opened 
a factory in New Orleans in 1838. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum has a country kitchen where visitors can sample American-style 
cakes and cookies based on original recipes, and one can sit outside enjoying 
the river scene. 
</P>
<P>
 There, sipping tea, Mr. and Mrs. Dennis Taylor from Yorkshire look contented. 
"What a grand view," she says. "And the gardens! It really gave you a sense of 
how close America was to England way back then." 
</P>
<P>
 Director McNaught's current passion is to get "quilts from every state in the 
Union." Meanwhile, he takes satisfaction in the museum's accomplishments so 
far. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the museum was founded 33 years ago, the British had no idea of the 
achievement of early American arts and craftsmanship," he notes. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was 2 1/2 million visitors ago."

CHANGING LIFESTYLES; POLAND FIGHTS AN INFLUX OF ILLEGAL DRUGS FROM ABROAD; THE 
COLLAPSE OF COMMUNISM HAS LOOSENED ENFORCEMENT AND CAUSED A CRISIS IN SOCIAL 
VALUES. MORE THAN 25% OF TEEN-AGERS ADMIT USING DRUGS, SAYS ONE STUDY.

<P>
 Edyta Starosta's athletic build and smiling face belie the fact that she's a 
speed freak.  
</P>
<P>
 Now six weeks into rehabilitation at the Monar drug treatment center in this 
village south of Warsaw, the 20-year-old says her experiences with illegal 
drugs terrified her. 
</P>
<P>
 She started with marijuana two years ago and moved on to amphetamines at the 
beginning of this year because "I needed something stronger." But, she says, 
"it turns out there wasn't anything good in it." She enjoyed the buzz the speed 
gave her in the beginning, but soon began having suicidal thoughts, 
hallucinations and memory loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just terrifying," she recalls, and she admits the pull of the drugs is 
still strong. "I know if I left here now, I would begin taking them again." 
</P>
<P>
 Edyta and tens of thousands of other young Poles have begun using illegal 
drugs since communism collapsed here in 1989 and the country's borders became 
more porous. The adoption of Western ways, relaxed penalties and changing 
European drug-traffic patterns have all contributed to the outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a very visible drug boom going on in Poland," says Marek Kotanski, 
founder of the 23 Monar centers and a pioneer in drug treatment in the days 
when the Communist government insisted Poland had no drug problem. "It's a very 
threatening phenomenon." 
</P>
<P>
 As a drug user and dealer, Jarek Skopowski, 23, has witnessed the boom 
firsthand. "In Poland and especially in Warsaw more and more people are 
addicted," he says. "There's a terrible invasion of amphetamines and their 
price has fallen drastically. There's a renaissance of LSD being brought from 
Holland." 
</P>
<P>
 Every illegal drug is available in Poland. The only one that's not popular, 
Skopowski says, is cocaine -- simply because it's too expensive. Studies show 
that while about 7% of Polish teen-agers admitted using drugs in the 1970s and 
1980s, the figure is now more than 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 Police blame the drug boom on increased availability and lower prices, but 
sociologists say the reasons run much deeper. 
</P>
<P>
 Janus Sieroslawski, who has studied drug use in Poland, points to "the 
consequences of the process of profound changes" unleashed since 1989 when 
Poland shed 44 years of communism, began building capitalism and democracy and 
adopted Western lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
 Poles have experienced "a crisis of norms and values, weakening of social 
control, unemployment (and) psychological stress" since the 1989 upheaval. 
These factors, Sieroslawski said, encourage many to escape into 
"pharmacologically induced oblivion." 
</P>
<P>
 Poles have long appeared to have a self-destructive streak. They have been 
notorious abusers of alcohol, and with the adoption of Western ways, 
glamorously packaged bottles of foreign booze are flooding the Polish market. 
</P>
<P>
 But drug-treatment pioneer Kotanski thinks Western influences are too facile 
an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 He points instead to change-of-system stresses. "With the economic 
transformation, every family is in a constant chase for money," he said. "There 
is great frustration because of the discrepancy between great expectations and 
the reality. We are still unprepared for quick changes." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly Polish customs officials were unprepared for the influx of drugs 
after war broke out in the former Yugoslav federation in June, 1991, cutting 
off traditional trucking routes to Western Europe from Turkey, Asia and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Lax laws and inexperienced customs officers made Eastern Europe a paradise for 
drug smugglers. Because Communist border security had been so tight, and 
punishment for criminal offenses so harsh, practically no one smuggled drugs 
into the region before 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime isolation from the West also meant there was little, if any, 
cooperation with more sophisticated police forces and customs authorities in 
Western Europe. In addition, most East European countries emerged from the 
Communist era without any laws against possession and use of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "A policeman stops a drug dealer with eight kilograms (17.6 pounds) of 
amphetamines on him, as happened last year in Szczecin, and can't do anything," 
complained Bogdan Zielinski, Poland's top narcotics police officer. "We 
arrested him, but then had to release him and apologize. Such a situation would 
not have taken place anywhere else in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Police are further hamstrung in their attempts to fight drug trafficking 
because undercover operations, drug buys and sting operations are all illegal, 
although the Polish government is moving to change the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the East European countries, Poland emerged as a favorite transit route 
for drug smuggling because of its seaports. A series of recent drug seizures 
confirm Poland's heightened role in world drug-smuggling: 
</P>
<P>
 * In January, Polish customs officers seized 1,140 pounds of cocaine worth $45 
million in a ship's cargo of bananas. 
</P>
<P>
 * Working with Polish authorities, British customs officers intercepted 2,640 
pounds of cocaine being smuggled by ship from South America to Poland via 
Liverpool in February. "Polish ports are now the main entrance for cocaine to 
Europe," said Maciej Lubik, a top Polish customs official. 
</P>
<P>
 * That same month, Polish authorities confiscated about 200 gallons of a 
crucial ingredient of amphetamines disguised as ketchup coming from Bulgaria. 
Poland has become a center for the manufacture of black-market amphetamines for 
export to Scandinavia and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 * In May, Polish customs officers seized 88 pounds of heroin worth $3.2 
million being smuggled to Germany in two cars. This first seizure of drugs on 
their way out of Poland led police to suspect a narcotics packing plant had 
been set up within the country to serve Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 As for curbing drug abuse, Kotanski is pessimistic. "There is no drug 
prevention in Poland," he says flatly. "I don't see any forces on the scene who 
are seriously interested in dealing with this situation properly."

NEXT STEP; U.S. FIRMS 'WORK' FOR CHINA WORKERS; AMERICANS ARE TRYING TO EXPORT 
GOOD LABOR STANDARDS ALONG WITH CAPITALISM, WITH MIXED SUCCESS. 
</P>

 Deng, a 20-year-old from Hunan, makes about $2.30 a day stitching the Nike 
logo onto shoes, and she thinks she's lucky. Compared to the conditions at 
other factories in this industrial region in southern China, the Nike plant is 
a workers' paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last month, Deng worked in a nearby Taiwanese-owned shoe factory, 
stitching shoes from sunrise until after midnight for 76 cents a day -- and no 
overtime pay. Supervisors kept workers locked in the factory compound, except 
for one hour each Sunday, when Deng would slip through the open gates to look 
for another job. When the Nike plant hired her, she left her salary and 
belongings at the old factory rather than risk going back. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a prison," she says, peering through her bangs. "The workers 
cried on the production line every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Change may be coming to the long hours, low wages, and dismal safety 
conditions behind China's economic miracle. And, ironically, it is the 
purveyors of capitalism -- U.S. corporations -- who are bringing the fastest 
labor reform to what was once known as the land of the worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Nike and rival Reebok are among a handful of U.S. corporations that are trying 
-- with mixed success -- to export U.S. standards to the developing countries 
where they do business. Their global codes of conduct forbid forced labor and 
underage workers, guarantee minimum wage, health and safety conditions, and 
proclaim concern for the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of a code of conduct for U.S. businesses overseas got a boost from 
President Clinton last month. In his decision to renew China's 
most-favored-nation trade status, he pushed a voluntary "set of principles" for 
U.S. companies doing business there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea behind it was we can't change China's attitude toward human rights, 
but we can change ours," said a Washington official. 
</P>
<P>
 China's headlong rush into international markets has made its government 
officials more interested in making money than monitoring human rights or labor 
conditions, critics say. Factory collapses, fires and injuries are common 
hazards for workers in China's booming industrial areas like Dongguan, just 
north of Hong Kong.  
</P>
<P>
 A constant flow of job-seekers from China's poor hinterlands guarantees a 
steady supply of cheap labor, giving employers great leverage over disgruntled 
workers. The message is clear: If you don't want your job, 100 other people do. 
Wages are rock-bottom, and safety standards can be even worse: Nearly 60,000 
workers died in industrial accidents last year, many at foreign-owned 
companies, according to the China Daily newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both sides are at fault," said Wong Wai-ling, a labor researcher at Hong 
Kong's Asia Monitor Resource Center. "China is not enforcing rules and foreign 
businesses are ignoring them." 
</P>
<P>
 After the most recent incident, a factory collapse that killed 76 workers in 
June, Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited survivors in the hospital, and 
local officials vowed to place permanent safety officers in large factories. 
But labor activists say that lasting improvements are unlikely to happen until 
workers can demand better conditions through independent unions, which are 
illegal in China. 
</P>
<P>
 The most active leaders of change, then, may come from outside the country. 
Enterprises overseen directly by American companies already have a good 
reputation in China, compared to Hong Kong, South Korean and Taiwanese 
competitors. The key, say labor activists, is to create uniform, industrywide 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Ching is part of Reebok's human rights audit team in Hong Kong. Every 
three months he formally inspects subcontractors' plants in China, and walks 
the factory floors frequently in between, checking fire extinguishers and the 
storage of chemicals, and letting the workers know he's there to look out for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look for things the management might be hiding from us," said Ching. "We 
go where they tell us not to go. We talk to the workers alone in their dorms." 
</P>
<P>
 By Western standards, the conditions at many U.S.-connected factories here are 
not great; by the standards of a developing country, they are. "Our workers get 
paid twice as much as local schoolteachers," said John Baratta, the production 
manager at Nike's Dongguan plant."Supervisors make more than a surgeon with 20 
years' experience." 
</P>
<P>
 But even the Americans have their problems. Speaking out of management's 
earshot, workers at the Nike plant in Dongguan say they work up to 15 hours a 
day -- five hours longer than the legal maximum -- to finish their quotas. 
Nurses in the company clinic say young women often faint on the production line 
because, trying to catch a few more minutes of sleep, they skip breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 Nike at least has a representative on its subcontractor's premises every day. 
Most U.S. companies that produce or buy in China act solely through 
subcontractors or middlemen, a practice that can shield them from 
responsibility for poor conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Gary Edwards of the Ethics Resources Center, which provides ethical 
training to U.S. corporations: "They deliberately don't ask questions they 
don't want to know the answers to." But other American firms are making 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sears, whose shelves are also stocked with many made-in-China products, passed 
a resolution in response to shareholder pressure in March, 1992, to avoid 
buying products made by prison labor. That stance placed Sears in the company 
of Levi-Strauss, Timberland, Phillips-Van Heusen, Nike and Reebok: corporations 
that have established global codes of conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The implementation of these well-intentioned statements can be difficult. 
Subcontractors inevitably use materials from other sources, and labor camps can 
have innocuous sounding names. 
</P>
<P>
 "How technical do you get?" asks Nike's Baratta. "I don't know how you can 
trace back every component that comes to us." Levi-Strauss is phasing out of 
China precisely because it couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The corporations who do follow through to enforce their codes of conduct have 
noticed a positive, if limited, impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Tseng, a director of Taiwanese manufacturer Yu Yuen, which makes sport 
shoes for Converse, Nike, Reebok and others, said Reebok's requirements spurred 
his firm to upgrade its other factories as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from altruism, treating workers well makes good sense, say some business 
people. Reebok's Ching said some suppliers initially balked at improving 
quality and conditions. "But now they're seeing it can help them too," he said. 
"They see the benefit of maintaining a steady work force." 
</P>
<P>
 But as momentum grows in Washington for a voluntary corporate code of conduct 
overseas, the business community is less enthusiastic. "I am tired of being 
told that business is morally responsible for the human rights situation in 
China," said Robert Kapp, the president of the U.S.-China Business Council, the 
backbone of the lobbying effort to retain China's favored trade status. "It is 
fallacious and needs to be resisted." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Martin, the president of Hong Kong's American Chamber of Commerce, said 
most of the 200 U.S. businesses based in Hong Kong already have general 
policies to protect employees. Executives, he says, simply don't want more 
interference from the U.S. or Chinese governments. 
</P>
<P>
 If the idea that "doing good is good business," is not persuasive enough for 
U.S. corporate leaders, fear of bad publicity might be the deciding factor. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent spate of disasters across the border are making Hong Kong-based 
executives take a closer look at what goes on behind factory doors. The 
American Chamber of Commerce is creating a model code of conduct and just 
established a working group on worker-safety education.  
</P>
<P>
 To be linked to an industrial tragedy, said Martin, would be "a public 
relations nightmare."

GORE PRAISES OAKLAND PORT PROJECT TO RESTORE WETLANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An innovative project that will take excess mud from the Port of Oakland and 
use it to restore wetlands in the Sonoma Bay won rave reviews from Vice 
President Al Gore on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The project will boost port business by creating deeper shipping channels, 
help the environment, create jobs and serve as a national model of civic, 
business and conservationist cooperation, Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a win-win-win-win deal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems at the port stem from the fact that its main shipping channels are 
only 38 feet deep at their shallowest points, meaning modern super-size 
container ships need to wait for high tide to come in and out. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to deepen channels to 42 feet stalled for lack of a place to put the 
dredged mud after the old method of simply dumping it at sea became 
environmentally unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 Delays on finding alternative sites -- dating back at least 20 years -- had 
created a "mudlock" that threatened the area's maritime survival, said Walter 
Abernathy, president of the Bay Dredging Action Coalition, which includes 
environmentalists, labor, shipping lines and ports. 
</P>
<P>
 But the project got a push last summer when President Clinton instructed the 
regulatory agencies and the Army Corps of Engineers to "get on with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, three disposal sites have been identified, the biggest being the 
Sonoma Baylands, which will get about 2.6 million cubic yards of mud to restore 
a 300-acre tidal marsh. An additional 1.4 million cubic yards will go to 
improve an Oakland golf course and 1.7 million cubic yards will be dumped at 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The mud to be transferred has been tested and does not show hazardous levels 
of contamination, port officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dredging project is expected to cost $137.5 million, two-thirds of that 
federal funds, and will take up to two years to complete, according to the 
port. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials expect to solicit bids on the first phase of the dredging project by 
December, although some permit hurdles remain and agreements have yet to be 
signed with the port and other state and regional agencies, said port spokesman 
Bob Middleton. 
</P>
<P>
 Documents filed so far do not indicate any major hitches, Middleton said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lighter mood, Gore illustrated the coalition's unstoppable attitude with 
a story about an Oklahoma oil rig fire. The blaze, he said, was so fierce it 
kept city and county departments at bay. But a volunteer company drove its 
truck past the cordon of watchers, charged up to the rig and put the fire out. 
A grateful owner promptly wrote the company a $10,000 check, which led a 
reporter to ask the chief how he planned to spend it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'Well, I guess we'll take it and take this truck here and take it 
back and get the brakes fixed," Gore said.

POLICE, DOGS SEARCH HOME WHERE BODY WAS DISCOVERED IN FREEZER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dogs trained to find cadavers searched a basement Monday in the home of a man 
charged with murdering a Newport Beach woman missing since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities also checked on the safety of women whose names turned up in the 
files of John Joseph Famalaro, who was arrested Wednesday in connection with 
the death of Denise Huber. But there was no immediate sign of new victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies found a battered body, later identified as Huber's, in a 
freezer inside a long-overdue rental truck parked outside a home in an affluent 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would be premature to . . . try to speculate if we have any additional 
victims," said Yavapai County Sheriff G.C. (Buck) Buchanan. "We have not seen 
anything to indicate (that) so far. We're trying to keep a very open mind on 
this at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 The naked body in the freezer was identified Saturday as that of Huber. She 
disappeared June 3, 1991, on the way home from a concert, leaving no clues 
beyond a car sitting with a flat tire beside a Southern California freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro, 37, a home remodeler and real estate salesman, was arrested after 
the body was found Wednesday. He was held for investigation of murder and 
felony theft in the Yavapai County jail on $250,000 bail. The theft charge 
involved the Ryder truck, which was never returned after it was rented in El 
Toro in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Buchanan, clad in cowboy boots and hat, directed about 40 deputies and 
volunteers searching Famalaro's home in Prescott Country Club, a development 
outside this hamlet 75 miles northwest of Phoenix. They spent much of the day 
hauling out 3,000 to 4,000 cans of paint stored in the basement and in a 
14-by-35-foot area dug out of the hillside in which the home is set. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the cache of full and partly full paint cans, the home was 
cluttered with boxes, magazines and other odds and ends, said sheriff's 
spokeswoman Laurie Berra. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like he saved every magazine he ever got," Berra said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two dogs and handlers from the Rocky Mountain Rescue volunteer organization in 
Salt Lake City took part in the search. Buchanan said the dogs showed interest 
in two spots in the dug-out area Sunday, and they were taken back in at least 
twice Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Searchers in Arizona and other states worked to track down about 10 women 
whose names appeared in records in the house and found at least five of them 
unharmed, Buchanan said. He refused to describe the documents but said at least 
some of the women apparently were in contact with Famalaro through his 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies said Famalaro ran a home remodeling and painting business, 
and his lawyer said he had most recently worked as a real estate salesman. 
Prescott defense attorney Lawrence William Katz said he had advised his client 
against public comment and refused to discuss the case other than to say 
Famalaro is innocent. He refused to say whether Famalaro knew Huber or if he 
was aware of the body in the truck.

SECOND DEAD NEWT POSES PROBLEM FOR SHUTTLE SCIENTISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A second newt was found dead Monday aboard space shuttle Columbia, and 
scientists were trying to figure out how to fish it from its tank without 
splashing water that could float around the laboratory and damage sensitive 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving the dead newt in the tank would increase the chance of contaminating 
the water for the newts, newt eggs and guppy-like fish in that tank and the two 
others hooked to the aquarium system. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission manager Lanny Upton said the astronauts would not be asked to open the 
tank and pull out the dead newt unless it is safe to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Water, like other fluids, forms quivering globules the size of golf balls and 
bigger when spilled in the weightlessness of space. The fear is that those 
globules might slam into instruments and splatter. 
</P>
<P>
 The newt's death Monday leaves only two adult newts aboard the shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiederhold and other scientists on the ground want to see how the animals 
develop and behave in weightlessness and thus learn more about human 
development for missions someday to Mars and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's either something peculiar with these newts or who knows? We just 
haven't been able to figure out anything," said Michael Wiederhold, a 
researcher at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers are reluctant to remove and freeze the tank, as they did last week 
in the case of the first dead newt, because the aquarium system needs three 
tanks to operate properly and only three are left. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 48 newt eggs have been hatched in space. The shuttle's Japanese 
Medaka fish population is also experiencing a baby boom. Most of the 340 eggs 
sent into space and six or seven of those laid in orbit have hatched.

A GIANT LEAP FOR STRAWBERRY; BASEBALL: SAN FRANCISCO IS 8-0 SINCE THE FORMER 
DODGER OUTFIELDER JOINED THE TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Darryl Strawberry and the San Francisco Giants have proved to be a winning 
combination. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's definitely picked us up," Manager Dusty Baker said Sunday after the 
Giants beat the Montreal Expos, 6-4. It was San Francisco's eighth consecutive 
victory -- all since Strawberry joined the club. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew he could help us and that we could help him. He's just happy to be 
playing again. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see such exuberance from a a veteran, it has a positive influence on 
the club." 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry has helped the Giants make up five games on the first-place Dodgers 
in the National League West. San Francisco began play Monday in third place, 4 
1/2 games back. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry's performance with the Giants is being compared to Fred McGriff's 
effect upon Atlanta last season after the first baseman joined the Braves 
following a trade from San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 McGriff sparked the Braves to a 51-17 record after June 20, when they trailed 
the Giants by 7 1/2 games, and beat San Francisco by one game for the division 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 Can Strawberry do the same for San Francisco? 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a big presence behind Barry (Bonds) and Matt (Williams)," Baker said. 
"And he's getting big hits, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to get back in the race as soon as possible. We can't see the light 
at the end of the tunnel yet, but it's not high-noon either." 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie William VanLandingham pitched no-hit ball through 7 1/3 innings, 
leaving after Lenny Webster doubled and Mike Lansing walked. Rod Beck got four 
outs for his 20th save. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams led the Giants with a two-run homer, his 34th, in the first against 
Jeff Fassero. Todd Benzinger contributed a two-run double, while Bonds and 
Strawberry each drove in a run. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds went 10 for 19 in the series with two two-homer games and seven RBIs. 
Strawberry went nine for 17 with two homers, including a grand slam, and seven 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I wanted to do when I started playing again was get comfortable," 
Strawberry said. "It's coming. It's almost there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants got 47 hits in posting their first four-game sweep at Montreal 
since Aug. 11-14, 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory also gave them an eight-game winning streak for the first time 
since July 20-Aug. 1, 1991, when they won 11 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still in third place, there's a long way to go," Williams said. "We 
need to keep winning and put pressure on the other teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a coincidence that we've been winning since (Strawberry) has been 
here, but that's because of the way he's swinging the bat. One or two guys 
can't do it alone everyday. Everybody's got to contribute." 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry entered the series with only an infield hit in 11 at-bats in his 
first four games at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Before signing with the Giants, Strawberry was "seconds away" from signing 
with Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked Kevin (Malone, the Expo general manager) a lot," said Strawberry, who 
has a history of success hitting at Olympic Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was difficult to choose. I continued to think about it all that night 
(before signing). 
</P>
<P>
 "But who knows what the future holds? I'll be a free agent at the end of the 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry began the season as a member of the Dodgers, but during the first 
week of April admitted he had a substance abuse problem and was admitted to the 
Betty Ford Rehabilitation Clinic in Palm Desert, Calif. Later, he was released 
by the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was ready to retire and be with my family after the Dodgers released me," 
Strawberry said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when Baker called and convinced him to play for the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball is more fun now that my head is clear," Strawberry said. "Life is 
better now than I ever thought it could be."

 In the news: KCBS-TV Channel 2 has retracted a story by reporter Harvey Levin, 
which purported to show that prosecutor Marcia Clark was at O.J. Simpson's 
estate before a search warrant was obtained. As a result, says investigative 
comedy reporter Tony Peyser, KCBS News Director Bob Jordan has indefinitely 
postponed Levin's two-part interview with Amelia Earhart. There is no truth to 
the rumor however, reports comedy writer Bob (Woodward) Mills, that KCBS is 
changing the name of its news shows to RetrACTION NEWS.

 Boxing promoter Don King has been indicted for insurance fraud. On the 
brighter side, says comedy writer Mark Miller, King will be able to see Mike 
Tyson more often. The grand jury that indicted King, adds Mills, came within 
one vote of also charging him with criminal misuse of hair-care products.

 Doc watch: A group of doctors now says that a ruptured disk no longer always 
causes back pain, says Jay Leno: "A group of lawyers, however, says, 'Yes it

<P>
 Leno, on news that 32 doctors are running for Congress: "Imagine being both a 
doctor and a congressman. This would be strange. Half the time you're thinking 
you're God, telling women to take their clothes off. And the other half you're 
a doctor." 
</P>
<P>
 Leno, on a veterinarians group advocating regular medical checkups for the 
fish in your aquarium: "This has got to be a great scam. . . . 'You know Mr. 
Johnson, sure you could go down to the pet store and get a new goldfish for 
about a buck. Personally, I'd recommend the $4,500 gill transplant.' "

 O Solo Mio: The biggest surprise of "Encore! The Three Tenors" concert 
Saturday at Dodger Stadium, says comedy writer Peyser, came when Pavarotti, 
Carreras and Domingo closed the show with a Village People medley. Due to 
budget cuts at some PBS affiliates, Peyser adds, viewers in some parts of the 
country only got to see "The Two Tenors." 
</P>
<P>
 Fans who couldn't afford concert tickets, says comedy writer Mills, were 
treated to an impromptu performance in the Dodger Stadium parking lot -- by 
Opera Man from "Saturday Night Live." 
</P>
<P>
 For those of you who missed Saturday's final score: Pavarotti won 3-2, says 
comedy writer Larry Swerdlow, with a bass hit up the middle.

BOOK REVIEW / MEMOIRS; FINDING A LIFE BEYOND NIGHTMARISH EXISTENCE; GAL / A 
TRUE LIFE BY RUTHIE BOLTON , FORWARD BY JOSEPHINE HUMPHREYS; HARCOURT BRACE 
$19.95, 288 PAGES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 T rue is one of those words so over-used that the meaning all but disappears. 
Ruthie Bolton restores it. As she narrates, with neither apology nor self-pity, 
her remarkably difficult life, her voice -- its idiom and rhythm, diction and 
distinctive style -- transforms a sequence of events into more than mere 
chronology.  
</P>
<P>
 The tale of the little Charleston girl raised and abused, used and discarded 
over and over by a family to which she is unrelated by blood, cumulatively 
takes on the elements of a mythic journey. 
</P>
<P>
 Cinderella's evil stepmother seems like Betty Crocker compared to Daddy, the 
Navy man whose pure meanness informs, directly or indirectly, every misfortune 
to befall Ruthie Bolton.  
</P>
<P>
 He repeatedly drove her teen-age mother (his wife's daughter from a previous 
relationship) from home. He whipped his children with belts and any other handy 
object for the most minor offenses, and for the most part withheld love, 
kindness and financial support.  
</P>
<P>
 In return, he expected automatic respect, devotion and old-age care. 
Amazingly, more often than not, he got just that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gal" is a record of a woman who survived hell -- barely -- who frequently 
masked her pain with drugs and alcohol, and then slowly, willfully, fought to 
forge an independent identity. It discovers the persistent flame of a stubborn 
candle -- Ruthie Bolton's endurance -- amid a poverty of affection and material 
goods that is almost impossible for a reader to comprehend.  
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, "Gal" deals unflinchingly with issues of male and female, 
African American and white, power and dependence, but somehow it overturns 
every cliche and gradually affirms the power of good in the face of bad. 
</P>
<P>
 The publication of this understated autobiography is a story unto itself: a 
mutual acquaintance told acclaimed South Carolina novelist Josephine Humphreys 
("Dreams of Sleep," "Rich in Love") about Bolton's 58-page, hand-written 
manuscript and urged her to take a look. She wound up doing far more than that. 
</P>
<P>
 Impressed by Bolton's unique life and by her natural talent for language, 
Humphreys took time away from her own work to be, as she puts it, "only a 
witness and a secretary," recording and then transcribing the book over an 
extended period of time. She forwarded the text to her own New York agent with 
a strong endorsement. It was a singularly generous act, and we are all its 
beneficiary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gal" is that rare achievement that succeeds brilliantly as both literature 
and sociology. In the process of unfolding one life, it indelibly captures a 
particular time and place -- and through the prism of that meticulously 
rendered context, it illuminates the common humanity, or inhumanity, of which 
we are capable. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike ersatz celebrity life stories that periodically float on national 
bestseller lists (one recent country music star's comes especially to mind), 
Bolton does tell the truth -- all of it, or at least as much as we can stand to 
hear.  
</P>
<P>
 She emerges as no saint -- a woman who looks back over her poor choices with 
as much regret as forgiveness -- but as real. What's more, she has the rare 
ability to stand outside herself, to observe evenhandedly and marvel at her 
blindnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 When her second husband, Ray, introduces her to a huge extended family that, 
in its welcoming embrace is everything that her own background lacked, Bolton 
can't cope. "I couldn't accept it from them," she tells us, as frustrated as we 
by her refusal. "I know it's hard to believe, but I couldn't. Some kind of 
craziness stopped me." 
</P>
<P>
 But she's flexible, ultimately optimistic. She learns. And in the radiance of 
unremitting love, she flourishes, even to the point of returning to rebuild the 
house where she was nearly destroyed and nursing her diabetic stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
 She even manages to overcome the final indignity of being excluded from 
Daddy's will and having to pay rent to a couple of hardhearted sisters for the 
house she had diligently maintained. "Sometimes," she says stoically, "it's 
best to smile and be happy. And that's what I did. Ray called me a good actress 
for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for all her resilience, Bolton is tough -- and no fool. She did what she 
had to do, what she needed to do, when she needed to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Daddy was alive," she writes, "he beat me with his hand, with sticks, 
with extension cords. He's dead and gone now and I never could say he saw Gal 
cry. So why was I crying when he died? I wasn't even his blood, I still felt 
that he was Daddy. He was the only one that I had." 
</P>
<P>
 For a very long time, Bolton took her life as it came, made the best of it she 
could. And then one day she woke up from her terrible waking dream and wrote it 
all down. 
</P>
<P>
 And made it hers.

 Chemists are searching for a medicinal bumper crop. The National Cancer 
Institute is attempting to turn plants into drugs, testing as many as 20,000 
extracts of natural products per year. Similar efforts have yielded the cancer 
drugs vincristine and vinblastine, from the rosy periwinkle plant of 
Madagascar, and taxol, derived from the Pacific yew tree. "Nature is still in 
many cases the most economical source for medicines," says Gordon Cragg, chief 
of natural products branch of the NCI. Cragg says 99.5% of the world's plants 
have yet to be investigated for their medical value. The remainder has provided 
about a quarter of all current pharmaceuticals. "You don't have to be a 
mathematician to predict that the remaining 99.5% of plant species will have 
something to offer," says Michael J. Balick, director of New York Botanical 
Garden's Institute of Economic Botany. So Much for This 'Cure' for Colic 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most popular treatments for infant colic doesn't work, according to 
a new study. One longstanding theory of colic -- the incessant crying of 
infants for reasons that can't be determined -- is that the babies are 
suffering from intestinal gas. Although this has never been proven, doctors 
often advise frazzled parents to give their babies simethicone, an 
over-the-counter medicine. One popular brand is Mylicon Drops. A study in the 
July issue of Pediatrics compared babies given simethicone to babies given a 
placebo. The result: There was no difference in the babies treated with 
simethicone -- even among the babies who showed "gas-related symptoms." So what 
to do? Sorry -- the authors note that "the explanation for the excessive crying 
remains elusive." Put Emergency Paperwork in Its Place -- Done

 The likelihood of kids getting hurt increases with summertime activities. You 
can speed treatment in hospital emergency rooms by doing some paperwork in 
advance. Santa Monica Hospital encourages parents to sign an "Authorization to 
Treat Minor" form. California law requires written parental consent before 
children under 18 can receive care in an emergency room. An authorization for 
treatment can also help anyone else who's looking after your children. The form 
is kept until the child turns 18. Call (800) 922-1002 to obtain the form.

FIRST IS FOREMOST TO ANGELS; BASEBALL: SNOW'S GRAND SLAM FUELS A NINE-RUN BURST 
IN OPENING INNING OF 13-4 VICTORY OVER THE RED SOX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Brian Anderson was sitting sullenly in the Angel dugout Monday night, 
wondering how his day could possibly get any worse. 
</P>
<P>
 It started when he got to the clubhouse and heard the news. Cleveland Indian 
outfielder Albert Belle was suspended for 10 days for using a corked bat. 
</P>
<P>
 Belle not only is Anderson's favorite player on his hometown team, but a 
player whom he unabashedly idolizes. He has posters of Belle in his room at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to think the guy was God," Anderson said. "That's how much I think of 
him. He's always been my favorite. And now this." 
</P>
<P>
 If that wasn't enough, the Boston Red Sox came out and scored two runs against 
Anderson in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 He sat slumped on the bench, but before he could brood further, something 
wonderful happened. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels erupted for nine runs in their biggest first-inning in franchise 
history, resulting in a 13-4 victory over the Boston Red Sox before 17,019 at 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an inning that featured absolutely everything. The Angels had three 
walks. They had a strikeout. They had a single. They had three doubles. They 
had two triples. And they had a grand slam, courtesy of first baseman J.T. 
Snow. Most amazing is that the Angels scored eight of those runs with two outs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels had not scored that many runs in a single inning since May 8, 1989, 
and had not had a bigger inning at Anaheim Stadium since July 10, 1982, against 
the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow's grand slam was the first of his career, and the first by an Angel in 
the first inning since Bobby Grich on Sept. 22, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an inning that not only sent rookie pitcher Tim Vanegmond to the 
showers -- after yielding four hits, three walks and seven earned runs in only 
two-thirds of an inning -- but might have sent him packing his bags for 
triple-A Pawtucket with a 12.60 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel center fielder Chad Curtis and designated hitter Chili Davis were the 
only players who didn't reach base against Vanegmond, but Curtis made amends. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis greeted reliever Jose Melendez with a double to left field in the first 
inning, hit a home run in the fourth inning against Melendez, and then said 
farewell to Melendez with a two-run homer in the sixth. And to show it was 
nothing personal, Curtis singled against reliever Chris Howard in the seventh 
inning for his fourth hit of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was due for a night like this," Curtis said. "I feel re-juiced since the 
All-Star break. I wasn't worn down so much physically, but mentally." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, there was right fielder Jim Edmonds, who began the game in a miserable 
slump, batting .132 since June 26. 
</P>
<P>
 It had been going so badly that he picked up the telephone Sunday night and 
spoke with Randy Kapano, his Little League and high school coach. No one 
outside the family knows Edmonds better than Kapano, and he told Edmonds he had 
been waiting for his call. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the guy who got me to this point," Edmonds said, "and he knows when I 
need help." 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonds spent an hour with Kapano on Monday morning, taking so many swings in 
the cage that his hands had blisters. Edmonds showed up Monday night feeling as 
though he had conquered his problems. A few hours later, he was proved right, 
going three for four with two doubles, a triple, and two RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 It was that kind of night for the Angels, who also ended their Monday jinx, 
winning on Monday for the first time since June 21, 1993, after losing the 
previous 15 times. 
</P>
<P>
 Who would have imagined that the Angels could pound out 13 runs and 14 hits 
without a hit by Davis, Bo Jackson or injured Tim Salmon? 
</P>
<P>
 In all, it was quite a memorable day for Anderson (6-4), who shut down the Red 
Sox for the next six innings, preventing them from entertaining any crazy 
notions. He gave up nine hits and four earned runs in 7 2/3 innings, winning 
for the first time since June 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it might have even been enough to curtail any immediate plans of 
bringing up left fielder Garrett Anderson and third baseman Eduardo Perez 
before the start of their next trip on July 28, although it still is under 
strong consideration.

ASTROS RALLY FROM 11-0, WIN, 15-12 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Houston Astros already knew how it felt to blow a big lead. On Monday 
night, they found out how it feels to overcome one. 
</P>
<P>
 The Astros matched the biggest comeback in National League history, rallying 
from an 11-run deficit to beat the St. Louis Cardinals, 15-12, Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Bass, Andujar Cedeno, Mike Felder and Ken Caminiti each drove in two 
runs during an 11-run sixth inning that put Houston ahead, 15-11. 
</P>
<P>
 The rally came four days after the Astros blew an 8-0 lead in Pittsburgh and 
lost, 11-8. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we kept getting closer, we started smelling it," Bass said. "After we made 
it 11-7, we felt pretty good because we had three innings left and were within 
a grand slam. It just snowballed from there." 
</P>
<P>
 Houston trailed, 11-0, after three innings. The Philadelphia Phillies overcame 
a 12-1 deficit to beat the Chicago Cubs, 18-16, on April 17, 1976, and the 
Cardinals rallied from an 11-0 deficit to beat the New York Mets, 14-12, on 
June 15, 1952. 
</P>
<P>
 The major league record for the biggest comeback is 12 runs, done twice in the 
AL. The Philadelphia Athletics rallied from 14-2 to beat the Cleveland Indians, 
17-15, on June 15, 1925, and Detroit came back from 13-1 to defeat the Chicago 
White Sox, 16-15, on June 18, 1911. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was unbelievable. I've never been behind 11-0 and come back to win, not 
even in the Pacific Coast League, where the ball flies around and you get crazy 
scores," Astro Manager Terry Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were down 11-0 and our guys didn't stop playing. They just kept pecking 
away and kept getting base hits. I can't believe what I saw. I was just 
thinking when each guy came up, 'Get a base hit!' and they kept doing it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston's 11-run inning came against four pitchers. Bryan Eversgerd (2-1) gave 
up four runs on four hits without retiring a batter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just pitched the wrong pitchers. It was my fault we lost," St. Louis 
Manager Joe Torre said after the Astros spoiled his 54th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Hampton (2-1) pitched two innings for the victory. Todd Jones got his 
third save. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Biggio led off the Houston sixth with a walk and scored on Bass' double. 
One out later, Caminiti walked and Luis Gonzalez followed with an RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
 James Mouton was hit by a pitch that loaded the bases and Tony Eusebio drew a 
walk that forced home a run. Cedeno hit a two-run single and Felder had a 
two-run triple that tied the score, 11-11. 
</P>
<P>
 Felder said he was so excited on his tying hit that "I almost fell at first 
base." 
</P>
<P>
 "They got to the ball and made a close play of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Biggio's infield single, Bass followed with an RBI single for a 12-11 
lead. A walk to Jeff Bagwell reloaded the bases, Caminiti hit a two-run single 
and Mouton drove in the final run of the inning with a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cardinal catcher Tom Pagnozzi: "At this stage of the season, it will be 
tough (to bounce back). They say you're supposed to get over it, but I don't 
know how you can do that after blowing an 11-run lead. I don't think anyone in 
the ballpark could have dreamed this." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis took a 3-0 lead in the first on Gregg Jefferies' RBI single, an 
error by Biggio at second base on Ray Lankford's grounder and Mark Whiten's RBI 
double. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals scored four times in the second on Bernard Gilkey's RBI single, 
Jefferies' 10th homer of the season, a two-run shot, and a run-scoring double 
by Todd Zeile. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis added four runs in the third on an RBI triple by pitcher Allen 
Watson, a run-scoring single by Gilkey and a two-run single by Lankford.

DODGERS DRAINED AFTER BEATING METS; BASEBALL: WORRELL BLOWS THREE-RUN LEAD, BUT 
THEY WIN IN 10TH, 7-6, ON KARROS' SINGLE. WALLACH HAS SIX RBIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Their closer gave up a three-run lead in the ninth inning, their second 
baseman spent the day at the doctor's office and their starting pitchers 
haven't lasted past the third inning in the last three games. Other than that, 
the Dodgers at least had a 7-6 10th-inning victory over the New York Mets to 
celebrate Monday night, but the underlying feeling couldn't have possibly been 
joy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm zapped," said Manager Tom Lasorda. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Dodger bus left Shea Stadium in the early hours this morning, it 
carried a team that appears to be going nowhere. Like a used car, just when one 
thing gets fixed, something else goes out. 
</P>
<P>
 The one area the Dodgers haven't had to worry about since early May is their 
starting pitching, but guess what? 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, their offense has regrouped, with Tim Wallach knocking in six runs 
Monday night. But by the ninth inning, Wallach's three-run homer and three-run 
double merely became a sidenote. Todd Worrell, who relieved Tom Candiotti to 
pitch the ninth inning, gave up a three-run lead to tie the score at 6-6 and 
increase the number of blown saves for the bullpen to 16.  
</P>
<P>
 Was Lasorda thinking about taking Worrell out? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I was going to let him go all the way," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Worrell had some help from Jeff Treadway, who started at second in place of 
Delino DeShields. Treadway bobbled a double-play grounder that would have ended 
the game. But the Dodgers came back to win in the 10th inning, when Mike Piazza 
beat out a two-out chopper to third base against Mauro Gozzo (2-4), the Mets' 
fourth pitcher. DeShields, who hasn't started the past two games because of a 
weak thigh muscle, pinch-ran for Piazza. He stole second and eventually scored 
on a line-drive single to left by Eric Karros. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Gott pitched the 10th inning and, with a big help from Carlos Hernandez, 
who threw out the tying run trying to steal second with no outs, closed the 
game to get his second save. And somehow in all that mess, Worrell (5-4) earned 
the victory.  
</P>
<P>
 But when Lasorda, who has had philosophical differences with Worrell this 
season, was asked after the game if Gott or anybody else had a chance to take 
over the closer's role, he said no. "You know how much we are paying that guy, 
he's the man," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Worrell earns $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers, though, have a problem with their starting pitching, one they 
haven't had in two seasons. They needed a solid outing from their starting 
pitcher, Ismael Valdes, which might have been asking a lot since it was his 
first major league start. But Valdes developed two blisters and didn't make it 
past the second inning.  
</P>
<P>
 Candiotti, who was scheduled to pitch tonight, was getting into the shower and 
about to leave the park when he saw Valdes come out. He sent the clubhouse 
attendant down to tell Lasorda he could pitch, and Chris Gwynn came running 
back with the news. Candiotti, pitching on two days' rest, was in. 
</P>
<P>
 Candiotti gave up two runs -- one earned -- and three hits the next seven 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to stay in (to pitch the ninth), but they reminded that I had thrown 
128 pitches on two days' rest," Candiotti said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Thursday, when the Dodgers' first game of the trip was rained out 
against Philadelphia, everything has gone wrong. Friday, Kevin Gross and 
Candiotti each started a game of the makeup doubleheader. Saturday, before the 
game started, Orel Hershiser walked off the mound during warmup pitches, and is 
sidelined for an undetermined amount of time -- could be two days or two weeks 
-- because of a muscle strain in his left side. Ramon Martinez, who was in the 
clubhouse exercising, put on his cleats and rushed to the mound. But he didn't 
last long, giving up nine runs, five earned, over 4 1/3 innings. Pedro Astacio 
crumbled Sunday, giving up six runs in 2 1/3 innings. The Dodgers lost three of 
four games.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers were hoping that by starting Valdes they could get through this 
three-game series with the Mets and to the off-day, at which point maybe 
Hershiser would be better. Gross will pitch tonight and Martinez on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care how you win them, as long as you win," Wallach said.

PLAYERS DUNKED IN A HARD COURT; PRO BASKETBALL: A FEDERAL JUDGE RULES THAT THE 
NBA'S SALARY CAP, COLLEGE DRAFT AND RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL ARE LEGAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge in New York City on Monday sent the NBA back to its usual 
off-season business, ruling against the players' union on key antitrust issues. 
</P>
<P>
 That freed teams and players to resume the signing of contracts, clearing the 
way for trades. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Kevin Duffy, clearly agitated that the union and league 
were "using the court as a bargaining chip" during negotiations for a new 
collective bargaining agreement, declared that the salary cap, college draft 
and right of first refusal were legal. 
</P>
<P>
 The players association had argued that the salary cap violated antitrust law, 
but Duffy ruled that the NBA was not subject to the law as long as it has a 
collective bargaining relationship with the union. 
</P>
<P>
 Duffy also criticized NBA lawyers for "sharp and shady practices of the type 
that most ethical lawyers shun" for filing its lawsuit as a preemptive strike 
because the union had threatened to sue. The union then countersued, using its 
most visible unrestricted free agents, such as Danny Manning, Dominique Wilkins 
and Horace Grant, as plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The union will appeal the decision, according to lawyer Frederick A.O. Schwarz 
Jr. In the meantime, the sides are free to continue negotiations on a new 
collective bargaining agreement. The last one ran out the day after Game 7 of 
the finals last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The ramifications of Duffy's deciding against the league would have been 
momentous. Most notably, it would have made all players picked in last month's 
draft unrestricted free agents and eliminated the salary cap, returning the 
pursuit of free agents, veterans and first-year players to outright bidding 
wars. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours of the ruling, Seattle sent Ricky Pierce, first-round pick Carlos 
Rogers and two second-round choices in the 1995 draft to Golden State for 
Sarunas Marciulionis and Byron Houston. The trade had been agreed to the day 
after the June 29 draft but had been held up until players could make contract 
adjustments to fit the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit is expected to re-sign free agent Sean Elliott and then trade him, 
possibly back to San Antonio for rookie Bill Curley. That move would give the 
Pistons some needed size up front and also put them about $6 million under the 
salary cap, allowing them room to sign someone such as Grant, who has said he 
wouldn't mind joining a rebuilding movement after winning three titles with 
Chicago, and lottery pick Grant Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning, meanwhile, still has no interest in going to a team that is years 
away from challenging for a championship, having already traveled that route 
with the Clippers. He has narrowed his choices to four or five teams, one of 
them the Lakers. His agent, Ron Grinker, says Atlanta is "barely" in the 
picture.

IT'S A SUCCESS -- EXCEPT THE FINISH; SOCCER: AFTER BRAZIL'S VICTORY ON PENALTY 
KICKS, METHOD TO BREAK TIE IN FINAL IS QUESTIONED.

 The 15th World Cup was pronounced closed -- and successful -- by organizing 
officials Monday, amid calls for changing the system for resolving tie games, 
such as Sunday's championship match between Brazil and Italy. For the first 
time in World Cup history, the champion was determined by penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA, the sport's international governing body, acknowledged that it, too, had 
found the game unsatisfying. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were not happy yesterday, and certainly the teams weren't that the game 
had to go to penalty kicks," FIFA General Secretary Joseph Blatter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to have a winner at the end of the competition. We can't repeat the 
final, otherwise it's not a final. So far, we have not a better solution. We 
can't decide a game with some other artifice and without a goal. For the time 
being, I can offer you nothing better. For drama, for the television, it was 
absolutely a highlight. But, naturally, it was not what we, in football, were 
expecting from this championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was expecting that two brilliant teams would play brilliantly, and 
they did, in overtime and penalty kicks. We cannot inform the tactical 
selections of the coaches. Because no one wants to lose the final, it was 
defensive from the beginning. There is no loser in penalty kicks. They say 
there is only a lucky winner." 
</P>
<P>
 Blatter said that in the 1998 World Cup in France, FIFA will institute the 
system it uses for its youth games. If the game is tied after 90 minutes of 
regulation play, two 15-minute overtime periods are used, the difference being 
the overtime is sudden death -- first goal wins. If the score is still tied at 
the end of overtime, penalty kicks are used. 
</P>
<P>
 Blatter was asked why it was not possible simply to continue playing until one 
team scores, as is done in some other sports. He citied the "culture" of the 
game and the physical stress on the players. 
</P>
<P>
 In the event of continuous play, Blatter said, "We could have a death on the 
field in the (hot) conditions we had yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
 One solution offered was to allow more substitutions to replace injured or 
tired players. Current rules allow only the substitution of two field players 
and one goalkeeper. Blatter said the substitution rule was unlikely to be 
changed but that options were being studied. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, FIFA is struggling with the issue of penalty kicks and the 
unsatisfactory results they produce. The issue came to the forefront again 
after Brazil won on penalty kicks, 3-2 -- the score officially was 0-0. At a 
news conference Monday, there was a chorus of international criticism about the 
method for determining the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, Blatter had praise for the organization of the World Cup, which 
produced, among other things, the highest attendance and most goals. FIFA's 
rule changes aimed at encouraging offensive play appeared to be successful, at 
least statistically. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1990 World Cup in Italy, for instance, five games ended in 0-0 ties as 
opposed to three this time. In Italy, four winners were determined by penalty 
kicks, three this time. Total tickets sold in Italy were 2.5 million, compared 
to 3.5 million this time, with an average attendance of 70,700. There were 163 
yellow card cautions in Italy, 227 this time; 16 red cards in Italy, 15 this 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Rothenberg, World Cup chairman, declared the organizing effort a success, 
noting few security problems and higher television ratings than had been 
expected. Rothenberg called the monthlong event a "love-in" and said the World 
Cup had served to unite the nation in a unique way.

HONESTY IS BEST POLICY; PROSPECT TOLD BASEBALL SCOUTS OF DRUG PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After he was selected in the second round of the amateur draft by the Detroit 
Tigers last month, Mike Darr was rewarded with a signing bonus of $225,000 and 
a college education fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he was given a drug test. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not normal treatment for a top prospect, in Darr's case it was 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabbed as one of the top high school outfielders in the country last season by 
major league scouts, the Corona High graduate was considered a risk after 
acknowledging he had spent much of his senior year battling a drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Darr and his parents, Mike Sr. and Debbie, decided to end countless drug 
rumors midway through the baseball season. By letter, they notified all 28 
major league teams that Darr had used marijuana and amphetamines during the 
fall. They also sent notes from doctors and results of subsequent drug tests 
that showed he had stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly we knew that it was a risk to go public with this information," 
Debbie said. "But there were so many rumors going around that we decided as a 
family that it would be better to be honest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although it was hard to talk about at first, we were never ashamed. We've 
done our best as parents, and things like this happen and you deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
 The news, although not a complete surprise to the scouts, had a negative 
affect. Darr, once regarded as a can't-miss prospect, was considered a gamble 
even in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that is going to keep Mike from becoming a major league player 
is Mike himself," said Rob Wilfong, the West Coast scout for the Tigers who 
signed Darr. "His drug problem made him a risk, though, and I had to convince 
my front office that it was a monetary risk worth taking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I give our organization credit for not backing down, like most other teams 
did." 
</P>
<P>
 Not being selected in the first round probably cost Darr several hundred 
thousand dollars in signing-bonus money, but he and his family are not 
complaining. They are elated to have salvaged a year that nearly crumbled 
several times. 
</P>
<P>
 After signing with the Tigers, Darr, 18, reported to their rookie league team 
in Bristol, Va. in mid-June. Before he had played his first game, Darr was 
given a drug test. The result was negative. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of this bothers me now," Darr said before a recent game in Bristol. 
"That's because I know the problem is over with. I've learned in life you have 
to face your problems. That's what I've been trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Things were not supposed to be difficult for Darr during his senior year. 
Aside from being a top prospect in baseball, he was also the starting 
quarterback on the football team. He had led the Panthers to the Southern 
Section Division V semifinals as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
 The strong-armed Darr had size to match. At 6 feet 3, 210 pounds, he was 
pegged by recruiters as a blue-chipper early on. The attention was nonstop, and 
Debbie said her son received an average of 10 telephone calls a night during 
the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his sports career was successful, he was struggling as many teens do. 
With his father away at work in the evenings, Darr would sneak out with friends 
and take drugs.  
</P>
<P>
 After an evening of getting high, Darr would return home before his father. 
The scheme worked for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie said that when she and her husband began suspecting something was wrong 
and confronted him, he denied everything. When his allowance was cut off, 
Darr's friends bought drugs for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things were really terrible around the house," Debbie said. "Mike wouldn't 
listen to anyone. My husband and I had always supported our son in everything, 
but we now couldn't get through to him. The whole thing took us by surprise and 
we didn't always know what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Things were falling apart on the football field as well. Darr, the team's most 
valuable player, started skipping practice. Coach Stuart Horn punished his 
quarterback by keeping him out of games. Darr sat out four of 11 games, 
including a first-round playoff loss to Indio, but he still passed for 1,423 
yards and seven touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "His parents and I talked frequently and I knew there was some kind of a 
problem," Horn said. "I followed my team rules by keeping him out of games for 
missing practice, but I realized there was something more important at stake 
here. Mike had a serious problem and I wanted him to turn things around and get 
help." 
</P>
<P>
 Things got so bad midway through the football season that Darr's parents 
checked him into a hospital in Corona for rehabilitation. Darr stayed for two 
weeks then, in retaliation, continued using drugs and staying out late. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of patience, Mike Sr. kicked his son out of the house. Darr moved in with 
a family friend, Don Johnson, an assistant football coach at Riverside 
Community College, and stayed for two months. 
</P>
<P>
 By November, Darr had lost 25 pounds and his football season was a washout. 
Recruiters stopped writing and calling. Darr was also considered an academic 
risk, because he had not taken the Scholastic Aptitude Test, required for NCAA 
eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike and his father were close because of their love for sports, but their 
opinions clashed quite often," Johnson said. "When things got bad at home, I 
agreed to take Mike in and do what I could. He was a mess, but slowly he began 
to come around. Through it all, he was still just a kid who wanted to be 
loved." 
</P>
<P>
 Darr went to football practice as often as he could but rumors began spreading 
among teammates and things became difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "Football season was a joke," Darr said. "It was no fun to be out there. My 
problems were always brought up." 
</P>
<P>
 By Christmas, Darr had returned home, admitted his problem and agreed to live 
by a strict set of rules. He began gaining weight and training for baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Darr says he has not used drugs in months. He had a productive baseball 
season, batting .533 with 12 home runs and 53 runs batted in. Corona advanced 
to the Southern Section Division III semifinals, losing to eventual champion 
Westminster La Quinta, and Darr was selected Riverside County player of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit and the New York Yankees were the only major league teams that did not 
visit the Darr home last spring, yet the Tigers ended up drafting Mike. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilfong, who played for the Angels from 1982-86, said he watched Darr play in 
at least 10 games during the season and was comfortable his top prospect had 
put his troubles behind.  
</P>
<P>
 "After talking with Mike's parents, I felt they wanted the same thing for 
their son that I did," Wilfong said. "I didn't need to see the inside of their 
house to determine that." 
</P>
<P>
 Surprised that Darr had lasted late into the second round, Wilfong once again 
urged the Tigers' front office to take a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the back of my mind, baseball is what I always wanted to be doing anyway," 
Darr said. "I'm more than happy to be here. I'm going to buy myself a new car 
with some of my money and work on my skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to concentrate on baseball and put the rest behind me."

SPLASH HAS PLACE SAVED FOR SHUE; 'MELROSE' SERIES STAR TO PLAY SOCCER AT POND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The interview is 52 minutes old and Andrew Shue says he has to run. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest, I've really got to get going," he says. "This is the longest 
interview I've done in a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh. Well, hey, I just wanted to ask you one more thing: What's better -- being 
a celebrity or being an athlete?  
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't take any time to answer because he has been both. Andrew Shue was 
an Ivy League soccer standout at Dartmouth, played professionally in Zimbabwe, 
competed for the indoor soccer L.A. United last year and will likely play 
outdoors when Major League Soccer begins next year. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also a star on the Fox series "Melrose Place," has dated co-star 
Courtney Thorne-Smith and is chatty with Heather Locklear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely, being an athlete," he says. "There's nothing inherently good in 
being famous. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 There are those who will look at Shue's appearance in a Splash uniform tonight 
against Washington and Thursday against Arizona and figure it is nothing more 
than a marketing tool. The franchise is averaging 3,932 fans through seven home 
dates at The Pond of Anaheim, and if every Orange County twentysomething 
addicted to "Melrose Place" attends the game, the Shue gimmick could be a 
bonanza. 
</P>
<P>
 "A year ago, you would have looked at it as a p.r. stunt," said Ron Weinstein, 
the league commissioner, "but he performed quite admirably last year -- to the 
point that (the) San Diego (Sockers) contacted him illegally." 
</P>
<P>
 Shue's appearance here is two-fold. He can raise money for his personal cause, 
Do Something, which he co-founded in 1993, and he can help a sport styled for 
the Fox TV crowd gain some much-needed exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would not have done it if he felt he was going to be used in a circus-type 
publicity stunt," said Tim Orchard, Splash co-governor/director of player 
personnel. "He was very adamant that he be positioned as a professional-caliber 
soccer player. He didn't want us calling him Billy from Melrose Place. He's 
Andrew Shue -- college star and possible future outdoor player in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping for a bigger awareness of indoor soccer, sure. Andrew Shue has 
the ability to draw from outside your typical soccer fans. We hope to get them 
here and hope the game hooks them." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though his indoor career consists of one game, Shue did gain the respect 
of those who competed alongside him on last year's United team. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can play," Splash defender Doug Neely said. "He takes his soccer pretty 
seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Shue was a World Cup spokesman and hopes to do a documentary about soccer in 
Africa, where his former team, the Bulawayo Highlanders, regularly played in 
front of crowds of 30,000 and won the national championship in front of 70,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to live life and every now and then take chances," Shue said. "(But) 
I wouldn't do this if I thought I was going to embarrass myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Weinstein: "Since Neil Diamond and James Caan supported the Lazers in the 
mid-'80s, I haven't met anyone so much in the public eye who's shown this kind 
of support to indoor soccer. He's coming out here for the love of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Shue can't stress enough that his primary reason for playing is to benefit Do 
Something and the secondary reason is to expose indoor soccer to new fans. Two 
sellouts would generate in excess of $100,000 for his nonprofit organization, 
which is getting a percentage of the proceeds. He is shy about making public 
appearances, and playing two soccer games is much easier than spending two 
months talking up a gala benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Do Something is a great idea, a pro-active idea," Splash General 
Manager Tim Ryan said. "It's a way to energize people to actually become 
involved in an organization as opposed to something that's a little less 
tangible. It's a win-win situation for the Splash, Do Something and Andrew 
Shue." 
</P>
<P>
 Do Something is designed to inspire and help the 13-30 crowd, the so-called 
Generation X , to take problem-solving action in their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you see a problem, try to fix it," Shue says, "because if you can think of 
it, you can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Applications for grants of up to $500 are available at Blockbuster Video, 
participating Guess? merchants and Boys and Girls Clubs. With the grant, these 
"social artists" as Shue calls them, are entrusted to enact change in a 
community much like Shue did while attending Columbia High School in South 
Orange, N.J. He began a program called Students Serving Seniors to aid local 
senior citizens; it is still in place, and he's in the process of launching the 
program on a national level. 
</P>
<P>
 Do Something's first three local chapters were in Newark, N.J., Boston and 
Selma, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt this was my opportunity to do my part," Shue says. "There was a lot of 
press about how this generation was a bunch of slackers. (President) Clinton 
said roll up your sleeves and start changing things. It's a campaign to 
popularize social participation by young people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want leadership training courses and small grants available in every 
county in America. We have a campaign to inspire the action, and then have a 
real structure to facilitate that action. We had 60 people go through the 
leadership course in Newark, and these people believe they're going to change 
Newark." 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't altogether surprising Shue feels the need to aid society -- his 
father ran for Congress, his mother worked for United Way and both brothers 
were Eagle Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's another one of the efforts being made to try to reverse the damage being 
done out there that has every young person saying the problems will be worse in 
five years," Shue says. "They have to start somewhere. Young people do need 
something to latch on to, to say yes to. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important for people coming out of high school or college to find 
something that's meaningful. So (the program is) trying to clean up the mess, 
society, and trying to change human beings into those who are giving people and 
who are community-oriented people." 
</P>
<P>
 Shue has played only one indoor game, and at best, will have only one indoor 
practice before tonight's game. He admits his strength -- passing -- could get 
lost in the indoor environment, and his weakness -- emotional control -- is 
exaggerated by the close quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely believe the game should be played outdoors," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He also understands the nature of the game and the dynamics of the situation. 
His is not a Mr. Big-Shot TV Star attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their first obligation is to win, their second obligation is to play me," 
Shue said. "I come out with a serious attitude about playing the game. I know a 
couple of guys on the team and they know I'm serious about it, and that's the 
most important thing. But I'm aware there could be some resentment. I have to 
handle it the best way possible; if they want me to play, I'll play. If they 
want me to take a shift now and then, fine. I'll do what they tell me." 
</P>
<P>
 Splash Coach George Fernandez is committed to getting Shue into the game, 
though he doesn't know exactly what he's getting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fans are coming to see him play," Fernandez said. "We've agreed to do 
this so we have to think positive. He's comin' in cold and going out hot." 
</P>
<P>
 Dartmouth won an Ivy League championship with Shue in midfield; he scored 
eight goals and had 17 assists during his four-year varsity career. And while 
teaching math at an African government school in Zimbabwe, he played on that 
national championship team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Skill-wise, there's no question he can play," said Splash midfielder Raffaele 
Ruotolo, one of the league's top scorers. "I don't think he's going to lose the 
game for us. I would be more than comfortable to have him on the field with me. 
I trust him." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Shue has to run. He's in the middle of that question about celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it tends to play on people's minds and you lose a lot of privacy," he 
continues. "Unless somehow you can put it to good use, it's not as good as 
everybody thinks. People always say, 'If I could only be rich and famous. . . 
.' Simpler things in life are what it's all about."

DON KING MAINTAINS INNOCENCE IN FRAUD CASE; BOXING: PROMOTER ALSO SAYS HE HAS 
SIGNED LIGHT-FLYWEIGHT CARBAJAL AWAY FROM RIVAL ARUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four days after being charged in a nine-count federal indictment, Don King 
said he was innocent and scored a coup against rival boxing promoter Bob Arum 
at the same time Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 With his arraignment on charges of insurance fraud set for Thursday in New 
York, King signaled that he would continue business as usual by announcing that 
he had signed a five-fight, $4-million-plus deal with Michael Carbajal, former 
light-flyweight champion in the World Boxing Council and International Boxing 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Carbajal, a 1988 Olympic bronze medalist and one of the highest-paid fighters 
ever in the lighter weights, had been one of Arum's most loyal fighters. 
</P>
<P>
 King did not directly address his legal situation, other than to say he had 
"absolutely" done nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-year investigation, King was charged with lying to an insurance 
carrier about the circumstances involving a bout canceled in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been indicted all my life, brother," King said at a news conference in a 
Century City hotel. "You just have to deal with it, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
 King said that confidence allows him to expand his stable of fighters, despite 
the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what demonstrates how good I truly am -- to continue to do this like 
I'm doing it," King said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A person who is running in fear or apprehension, he couldn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Carbajal downplayed King's legal problems and said King simply presented the 
Phoenix fighter with the most lucrative package. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pretty sure people are going to be saying why am I going with Don King," 
Carbajal said. "But it's something you couldn't pass up." 
</P>
<P>
 An angry Arum said in Las Vegas that Carbajal had agreed to a fight in 
September and that if he doesn't fulfill the unwritten deal, "it's going to be 
a war." 
</P>
<P>
 Arum, who represented Carbajal in the first $1-million payday for a 
lighter-weight fighter last February -- Carbajal lost in a rematch against 
Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez at the Forum -- says Carbajal agreed to a 
two-fight deal that was kicked off by Carbajal's victory over Josue Camacho 
last Friday for the World Boxing Organization's light-flyweight title. 
</P>
<P>
 The Carbajal camp said the fighter is "free and clear" because there is no 
written contract for a September bout.

EVANS SAYS O.J. CASE IS NOW BEHIND HIM; RAIDERS: RESERVE QUARTERBACK, 39, TOOK 
TO AIRWAVES TO URGE SIMPSON TO SURRENDER DURING FREEWAY CHASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Reserve quarterback Vince Evans took the snap from center, backpedaled, the 
bounce still evident in his 39-year-old legs, and looked for an open target. 
</P>
<P>
 Spotting one, he threw a tight spiral through the blue sky above Raider 
training camp. Satisfaction expressed itself through Evans' body language as 
the pass was caught. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been throwing footballs professionally for 18 years, but Evans' 
enthusiasm seems unaffected by the passage of time. 
</P>
<P>
 He loves being here in the sunny days of summer, this year more than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because it's such a contrast to the dark days he went through a few 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans was shocked by the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman 
and stunned by the news that former football star O.J. Simpson was going to be 
tried for the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike most, Evans had a personal connection. He has been friends with 
Simpson, a fellow member of the USC football program, for nearly two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had the SC bond that we kid about all the time," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 And unlike all but a very few, Evans was able to express his feelings on 
national TV when he went on the air to appeal to Simpson to surrender to police 
rather than take his own life. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Friday, June 17. Simpson had been expected to turn himself in to 
police. Instead, he and his best friend, Al Cowlings, disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 When they were spotted on the freeway in Simpson's utility vehicle, Cowlings, 
at the wheel, told police, and a listening world, to keep their distance 
because Simpson had a gun to his own head. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans, sitting at home with his mother, Riva, was watching, finding it all 
unbelievable. 
</P>
<P>
 When he heard Cowlings mention the gun, Evans said he feared Simpson "was 
going to take himself out. I was just scared for the guy." 
</P>
<P>
 After Evans heard TV sportscaster Jim Hill broadcast an appeal to Simpson and 
Cowlings to pull over, Evans called the station to give Hill a message to pass 
on to Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 When he got through, Evans was crying so hard that he had to pause to make 
himself understood. He was told that Hill was on the air but that he would be 
put through. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next thing I knew, I was on the air," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans did not realize his words were going out across the nation until he 
heard his voice on his own television. 
</P>
<P>
 What the country heard Evans say was, "Guys, just give yourself up, man, just 
stop. Please stop in Jesus' name. Just stop, man, 'cause we love you." 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, Evans was overcome with emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 The KCBS audio feed had been picked up by KNX radio, so there was a chance 
Simpson and Cowlings were listening in their car. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he could hear me, I would have felt so bad if I couldn't have done 
something to try and stop it," Evans said. "I couldn't physically run down the 
freeway and jump in the car, but I could get on the phone. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "When it was over, I felt like I did what I was supposed to do. Hopefully, I 
did what millions of other people who had a friend in a dilemma would have 
done, had they had the opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Hill, a former NFL player himself, who first tried to talk to Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Face the situation." he advised. "It's happened. You have to deal with it. No 
way in the world is it going to get any better if you continue to run." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill knew his audience might consist of much of the nation, but said he put 
that out of his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think about how many millions were listening," he said. "I was 
talking to O.J. and A.C. . . . Maybe I helped in some small way to calm down 
what could have been an incident with a horrible ending." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Simpson surrendered at his home in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was relieved and thankful that he did not kill himself," Evans said. "I 
felt like my prayers had been answered." 
</P>
<P>
 Evans said he later talked to Simpson, who told him he had not heard the 
broadcast, but thanked him anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 And Evans is ready to move on. "That's it. It's over," he said. "I appreciate 
it if I had a chance to do some good, but that's behind me now." 
</P>
<P>
 He simply wants to be back in his world, throwing footballs into opposing 
defenses, living a life he appreciates more than ever.

MORNING BRIEFING: HUDEK LEAVES EGG ON FACES OF THE EXPERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They pitched for the same high school in Tampa, Fla. John Hudek was Texas' 
30th-round pick in 1985, and scouts projected him as a third baseman. Chris 
Myers was the first-round pick of the Baltimore Orioles in '87, a left-hander 
Wade Boggs said would be "like Dave Righetti -- only better." 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris Myers was a concert pianist -- he could orchestrate a whole ballgame by 
himself," said Jeff Vardo, the former baseball coach at Plant High, the school 
that also produced Boggs. "Hudie was the guy playing for peanuts and potato 
chips at the piano bar." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add pitchers: Ken Rosenthal of the Baltimore Sun notes that if if you had had 
to predict which one would end up unloading trucks for a department store, you 
probably would have said Hudek. And if you had had to predict which one would 
pitch in an All-Star game, you probably would have said Myers. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
 Hudek, the Houston Astros' rookie closer who was put on waivers last July, 
struck out Cal Ripken Jr. in the All-Star game a year later. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers, once the No. 7 pick in the country, represents the classic failed 
prospect, a pitcher who never reached the majors and left baseball at 25 to 
work for a department store. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Trivia time: What is the major league record for walks by one team in a game? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Awareness: A KNX radio traffic reporter commenting last Wednesday on 
congestion near the Rose Bowl, where a World Cup semifinal soccer match was 
played:  
</P>
<P>
 "Some kind of game is going on there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Handy man: Jeff Treadway of the Dodgers is 11 for 19 (.579) as a pinch-hitter 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Get a WATS line: Last week, Oakland Athletic Manager Tony La Russa used eight 
pitchers in a game against the Boston Red Sox, including five of them in a span 
of eight pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 Said bullpen coach Art Kusnyer: "At least I didn't have to pay for the calls." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fore-gone conclusion: How did Neal Anderson know it was time to retire from 
the Chicago Bears? 
</P>
<P>
 "I was playing golf and I shot a 74," said Anderson, 29, the Bears' 
second-leading rusher behind Walter Payton. "That was my lowest round ever, so 
that did it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Contagious? When balloting starts next year for the National League All-Star 
team, it could be nervous time for center fielders. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Pittsburgh's Andy Van Slyke was chosen, then sat out the game 
because of a broken collarbone. This year Lenny Dykstra was the pick and sat 
out because of an appendectomy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like it is: When things are going bad for a baseball team, one player or 
another often directs criticism against a teammate or teammates. Gregg 
Jefferies of the St. Louis Cardinals offers a refreshing change.  
</P>
<P>
 "As of right now, we stink," he said of the Cards. "And that's everybody. Me 
included." 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferies is batting .327.

 Wide receiver Johnnie Morton, a first-round pick from USC, signed with the 
Detroit Lions. Although terms weren't announced, the deal reportedly was worth 
$3.15 million for four years and included a $1.15-million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton holds the Pacific 10 Conference record for receivers with 201 catches 
for 3,201 yards. He set a school record last year with 78 catches for 1,373

 The Buffalo Bills signed No. 1 draft pick Jeff Burris, a defensive back from 
Notre Dame, to a four-year deal reportedly worth $2.8 million. The Bills also 
agreed to terms with linebacker Marlo Perry from Jackson State, a third-round 
pick, meaning all of the team's draft choices have been signed. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Veteran free safety Brad Edwards was released by the Washington Redskins to 
clear salary-cap room so the team can sign rookie quarterback Heath Shuler and 
four other unsigned draft picks. Edwards was offered a 65% cut from his 
$825,000 salary but was released after he turned it down.

<P>
 First-round draft choice Bernard Williams, an offensive tackle from Georgia, 
signed a five-year contract with the Philadelphia Eagles. The Eagles didn't

signing-reporting bonus.

FORMER USC TACKLE TAY BROWN, CAPTAIN OF '32 TEAM, DIES AT 82 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Raymond (Tay) Brown, captain of one of USC's greatest football teams, died of 
cancer Saturday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, an All-American tackle on the Trojans' 1931 and '32 national 
championship teams, was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
 He was captain of the '32 team that was undefeated and gave up only 13 points 
in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown coached after graduating, joining the staff at Cincinnati as line coach 
and head basketball coach. He returned to his hometown of Compton in 1937 to 
coach Compton College's football team. His teams had a 140-33-9 record, 
including four Junior Rose Bowl appearances. 
</P>

 While Mike Keenan was spending his first day on the job as coach and general 
manager of the St. Louis Blues, the team he left asked the league to void the 
hiring. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Rangers have requested that NHL commissioner Gary Bettman 
arbitrate what they termed Keenan's "attempt to terminate his employment." The 
Rangers also requested an investigation into Keenan's "reported agreement" with 
the Blues and "reported contact" with the Detroit Red Wings.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Baseball, anyone? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe all the bats are corked like Albert Belle's, and that's why all the 
balls are traveling so far. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If I'm running the Dodgers, I don't give up major league hitting prospects 
such as Billy Ashley and Todd Hollandsworth for a veteran reliever such as 
Randy Myers. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Remember Boston trading Jeff Bagwell to Houston for Larry Andersen? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers' poor record against left-handed starting pitchers shows how 
overrated the righty vs. lefty, lefty vs. righty thing can be. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 L.A.'s lineup, you know, is packed with right-handed batters. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Walter Alston taught me to hate the emphasis put on such matchups when he 
platooned like crazy, especially at the Coliseum. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers, who were supposed to be faster, are way behind last year's 
stolen-base pace. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe what Darryl Strawberry needed was a change of scenery, but nine games do 
not constitute a comeback. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Roger Clemens, who starts against the Angels tonight, pitches to Ty Cobb, as 
portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones, in the film, "Cobb," that is scheduled to open in 
December. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 However, it will be hard to recognize Clemens, who wears a 1916-style uniform 
and sports a mean, unshaven look. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Jimmie Reese is still with the angels. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Buck Showalter should stick to managing and leave the fashion critiques to Mr. 
Blackwell. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 How nice that owners and players are talking not about averting a strike, but 
averting a long strike. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the strike threat, don't expect many trades the rest of the way. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Most teams looking to strengthen themselves will look toward the minor 
leagues. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Houston is loaded with talent on the triple-A level and the White Sox have 
several young pitching prospects. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 One veteran who might be dealt is Pittsburgh outfielder Andy Van Slyke, who 
will be eligible for free agency after the season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Bret Boone has become one of the best infielders in the National League. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Don Baylor, the only Angel to win the MVP award, is getting the most out of 
the Colorado Rockies. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Ken Griffey Jr., Kenny Lofton and Devon White get more attention, but Brian 
McRae of Kansas City might be the finest defensive center fielder in the 
American League. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Gwynn makes sense, as usual, when he says it is tougher to bat .400 than 
to hit 60 home runs. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Without Ryne Sandberg, the Chicago Cubs are nondescript. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The young lions are powerful, but have you noticed that Kirby Puckett, 33, is 
leading the American League in RBIs? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Sign of the times: Atlanta Manager Bobby Cox will gear his pitching rotation 
toward the playoffs, not the division championship race, once the Braves clinch 
a postseason spot. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The folly of the balanced scheduled is demonstrated in the American League 
Central, where Cleveland and Chicago will play one another for the last time 
next weekend. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The AL East race could hinge on the arm of Baltimore reliever Lee Smith. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Ripken Jr.'s consecutive-game streak will reach 2,000 on July 31, barring 
injury. . . . What makes Ripken's streak even more remarkable is that he plays 
a taxing position, shortstop. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Look-a-likes: Moises Alou and a young Darryl Strawberry. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Key element in the National League West race might be the physical condition 
of San Francisco pitcher Billy Swift. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees aren't the only team in New York having a disappointing time at 
the box office. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Mets attracted only 24,855 Sunday to Shea Stadium. Granted, the San Diego 
Padres were the opponents, but there was an old-timers' game saluting the 25th 
anniversary of the 1969 World Series champions. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 No one has pitched a shutout for either Detroit or Baltimore. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 How much does the thin air at Mile High Stadium in Denver help the Rockies' 
batting averages? The Air Force Academy at nearby Colorado Springs led the NCAA 
this year with a team average of .360. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 After moving to within 4 1/2 games of the Dodgers on Sunday, San Francisco 
Manager Dusty Baker said, "We can't see the light at the end of the tunnel yet, 
but it's not high noon, either."

INDIANS' BELLE FOUND GUILTY OF CORKING HIS BAT; BASEBALL: OUTFIELDER, SUSPENDED 
FOR 10 DAYS, IS FIRST PLAYER CAUGHT USING AN ILLEGAL BAT SINCE 1987.

<P>
 All-Star Albert Belle of the Cleveland Indians was found guilty Monday of 
corking his bat and suspended for 10 days after a weekend investigation that 
included a mysterious switched bat. 
</P>
<P>
 The American League resolved the case to its satisfaction after X-raying the 
bat, then sawing it in half. The league said the bat was "found to have been 
treated with cork." 
</P>
<P>
 Belle appealed the suspension, which will be delayed until his hearing before 
AL President Bobby Brown in New York on July 29. 
</P>
<P>
 "He appealed? I don't see how he can appeal, but that doesn't make any 
difference," White Sox Manager Gene Lamont said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time a player has been caught for using an illegal bat since 
1987, when Billy Hatcher of the Houston Astros was suspended for 10 days for 
corking. Graig Nettles of the New York Yankees was ejected during a 1974 game 
when rubber was found in his bat. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamont voiced his suspicions about Belle's bat during Friday night's game 
between the White Sox and Indians at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the White Sox staff had noticed that Belle had been hitting a lot of 
long balls to right field throughout the season and Lamont said he had "heard 
some things." 
</P>
<P>
 Each manager can ask to have one bat from the opposing team checked each game, 
and Lamont asked umpire crew chief Dave Phillips to check Belle's. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips seized the bat and placed it in the umpires' dressing room for safe 
keeping. 
</P>
<P>
 Or so they thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, during the game, someone worked their way above a false ceiling from 
the direction of the visitors' clubhouse and dropped through the ceiling into 
the umpires' dressing room. The thief took Belle's bat and left another bat in 
its place. The culprit still has not been identified. 
</P>
<P>
 By Sunday, there was another twist. The original bat, or what appeared to be 
the original bat, was returned. "I didn't know if it was corked or not," Lamont 
said Monday at Detroit. "Once it left the umpire's office, you kind of took for 
granted it was probably corked. Evidently they gave the right bat back, I 
guess." 
</P>
<P>
 Belle, who is facing his fourth suspension in six seasons with the Indians, is 
two for 12 since the White Sox asked for an inspection of the bat. The 1993 
major league RBI leader went one for four against the Texas Rangers on Monday 
night and is in a five-for-37 slump, batting .348 with 26 homers and 78 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Belle's agent was angry at Monday's findings. "We are outraged by the claim 
and feel that it is no more than a well-timed charge concocted by the White Sox 
in the heat of a pennant race with Cleveland, against the Indians' top hitting 
threat," Arn Tellem said.

PLAYERS' UNION REJECTS OWNERS' SALARY CAP; BASEBALL: NEGOTIATIONS WILL CONTINUE 
WEDNESDAY, BUT A STRIKE DATE IS EXPECTED BY JULY 31. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The threat of a work stoppage continued to cloud the 1994 season as the 
baseball players' union officially rejected the owners' salary cap proposal 
during a negotiating session in New York Monday and countered with a proposal 
that would basically maintain the current compensation system. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be more negotiations Wednesday, but the union is expected to set a 
strike date by July 31. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm extremely disappointed that the union has made no effort to respond to 
the game's economic problems or to the clubs' fundamental concern -- how to 
control costs," said Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would characterize the players' proposal as wanting more, more and more. It 
will not fly, and it doesn't do baseball or the fans any good for the union to 
remain rigid at this point in the game's history." 
</P>
<P>
 The union contends an August or September work stoppage, threatening the 
owners' postseason TV revenue, is their only leverage against the owners 
declaring an impasse and implementing their salary-cap system if there is no 
agreement by the end of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Fehr, executive director of the union, said that a salary cap would 
restrict salaries, transfer $1.2 billion or more from players to owners over 
the life of the contract, destroy free agency and arbitration, inhibit 
competitive balance because decisions would be made on the basis of economics 
rather than ability, benefit the large-market teams and reduce incentives for 
increasing revenue because clubs would be guaranteed a profit under the cap. 
</P>
<P>
 He reiterated that by linking increased revenue sharing among the clubs to a 
salary cap, the big-market clubs merely want to make the players pay for 
helping the small-market clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the revenue streams have changed," Fehr said, "why do the players have to 
pay? Why don't (the owners) simply change their revenue-sharing formula without 
linking it to a cap? The answer is obvious." 
</P>
<P>
 The players' proposal would increase the minimum salary from $109,000 to at 
least $175,000, eliminate certain repeat free agency restrictions, increase 
pension benefits and reduce arbitration eligibility from a basic three years of 
major league service to two. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic disagreement stems from a difference of opinion regarding the game's 
economic status. Ravitch insists that 19 teams will lose money this year, and 
that that number is growing. Fehr insists that revenue is 10 times greater than 
it was in 1976-77, and at $1.8 billion a year "it's difficult to accept 
Ravitch's contention." In the Black

 The New York Yankees distanced themselves from team vice president Richard 
Kraft, who was quoted in a magazine as likening Bronx youngsters to monkeys. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Rubenstein, spokesman for the team and owner George Steinbrenner, 
offered "an unequivocal apology for the statements attributed to Mr. Kraft" in 
the July 25 New York magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, however, Rubenstein issued a statement from Kraft denying having made 
the comments. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement responded to a scathing denunciation earlier in the day by Bronx 
Borough President Fernando Ferrer, who demanded that Steinbrenner repudiate the 
comments personally and fire Kraft, who is in charge of the team's community 
relations.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; WHITE SOX OVERCOME TIGERS' BIG LEAD, WIN IN 13TH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Shortstop Alan Trammell's throwing error in the 13th inning Monday night gave 
the Chicago White Sox a 10-9 victory over the Detroit Tigers at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Thomas hit a grand slam, Julio Franco had two home runs and Robin 
Ventura hit one as the White Sox overcame a 9-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Cecil Fielder homered twice and Kirk Gibson once for the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
 Joey Cora led off the Chicago 13th with a walk off Storm Davis (0-3). Tim 
Raines sacrificed and Thomas was intentionally walked. 
</P>
<P>
 Franco hit a hard grounder to Fielder at first base, who threw to second for 
the force. But Trammell's return throw sailed over the head of Davis, covering 
first base, and Cora scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirk McCaskill (1-2) pitched five innings of one-hit relief for the victory. 
It was the White Sox's 15th victory in 18 games and moved them past Cleveland 
for the Central lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas' grand slam on the first pitch from reliever Joe Boever tied the score, 
9-9, in the seventh. Thomas' third grand slam of his career was his 34th homer 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit built a 9-3 lead in the sixth behind Fielder's and Gibson's home runs. 
Franco and Ventura hit consecutive homers in the sixth off Mike Gardiner, 
making his first start after 32 relief appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Fielder hit a three-run homer in the first off Scott Sanderson, who was 
removed from the game in the second after doubles by Junior Felix and Juan 
Samuel and an RBI single by Tony Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 7, Minnesota 4 -- Joe Carter reached 20 homers for the ninth 
consecutive season and drove in four runs at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter hit his 20th homer in the first inning, a three-run shot, and added a 
run-scoring single in the sixth. He has nine RBIs in his last three home games 
and 13 RBIs in 10 games against the Twins this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Leiter (4-5) gave up four hits over six innings for his first victory since 
May 21. He gave up two runs, one earned, and struck out six. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Hall pitched the ninth for his 10th save. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Jays took a 4-0 lead in the first against Eddie Guardado (0-2). 
Roberto Alomar beat out an infield single, Paul Molitor walked and Carter sent 
a 1-2 pitch over the wall in left-center. Darnell Coles followed with a triple 
and scored on Ed Sprague's single. 
</P>
<P>
 Domingo Cedeno, Alomar and Molitor hit consecutive singles in the fourth to 
extend the lead to 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirby Puckett led off the eighth with his 15th homer and league-leading 86th 
RBI, one more than Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 2, Milwaukee 0 -- Jose Lind homered for the first time in three 
years and emergency starter Chris Haney baffled the Brewers for seven innings 
at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Lind's homer bounced off the left-field foul pole for his first home run since 
June 16, 1991, when he was playing for the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only his ninth homer in 979 major league games spanning eight seasons, 
and his first in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brewers were unable to solve Haney, a left-hander called up from triple-A 
Omaha for a spot start because the Royals were playing their sixth game in five 
nights since the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 6, Cleveland 5 -- Jose Canseco doubled home the go-ahead run with two 
out in the ninth at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers blew a 3-0 lead but came back to tie it, 5-5, in the seventh on a 
two-run single by Ivan Rodriguez off reliever Jose Mesa (7-5). 
</P>
<P>
 In the ninth, Mesa yielded a one-out double to Jeff Frye before Canseco hit 
his two-out double off the bullpen fence in dead center. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Henke got the last three outs for his 11th save. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 5, Oakland 3 -- Danny Tartabull had three hits and drove in two runs 
for the Yankees at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Tartabull hit his 17th homer and had a run-scoring single as the Yankees won 
their fifth consecutive game to remain unbeaten since the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 7, Baltimore 5 -- Edgar Martinez's double drove in Ken Griffey Jr. and 
Jay Buhner in the eighth inning at Seattle, breaking a 5-5 tie and ending the 
Mariners' five-game losing streak.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; DESHIELDS HAS TESTS ON INJURED THIGH

 Delino DeShields had an MRI and X-rays taken Monday in New York of his upper 
left thigh, which he says has long been troubling him. Results are expected 
today from Dave Altchek, the Mets' orthopedist who conducted the exams. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been hurting the whole time," DeShields said. "I just want to find out 
what's wrong and go from there." 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields, who has two hits in his last 16 at-bats, met with Manager Tom 
Lasorda and the coaching staff Sunday about his struggles at the plate and 
brought the injury to their attention. It is a 15-year-old injury to his left 
quadriceps that acts up from time to time, causing weakness. Previously, he has 
strengthened it through exercise, but that hasn't worked this season. 
</P>
<P>
 He is available to play, but Lasorda has started Jeff Treadway at second base 
the last couple of games to give DeShields time off. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 DeShields has become the Dodgers' resident barber. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody says they like (DeShields' work)," Raul Mondesi said. 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields and his father, Wilson, plan to open a hairstyling business close to 
DeShields' hometown of Seaford, Del. His father will run it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figure I had better learn how to do something else," DeShields said. "I'm 
in my fifth year in the major leagues, but I am trying to prepare for the 
future -- I'll have babies and they will have babies."

 The Dodgers' recent series against Philadelphia couldn't have come at a better 
time for Mike Piazza, who was able to go home to Valley Forge, Pa., after 
Tuesday's All-Star game at Pittsburgh.

 "I was pretty beat after the game, and it was great being home, spending time 
with my mom and eating her home-cooked meals," he said. "It was really 
relaxing." MARYANN HUDSON

1970, he also caught Nolan Ryan's no-hitter in 1973 -- Torborg's final season.

 Angel starter Chuck Finley wants the three home runs taken off his pitching 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Joe Magrane says it might be time to bring an X-ray machine to the 
on-deck circle. 
</P>
<P>
 And Jeff Parker, Angel assistant farm director, couldn't help but think back 
to a 1987 evening at Anaheim Stadium when he was a bat boy. 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction was created Monday when Cleveland outfielder Albert Belle was 
suspended for 10 days because he was caught using a corked bat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, deduct those (three) homers I gave up to him," Finley said. "I should 
get my ERA reduced for that. I think for punishment, they should let the 
pitchers move up to 40 feet from home plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe he thought he was saving on trees. You know, one half bat, the rest 
cork. Maybe now you'll quit hearing everyone say the reason for all these 
homers is because guys are so much bigger and stronger because of all their 
time in the weight room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right." 
</P>
<P>
 Magrane remembers the days when St. Louis Cardinal Manager Whitey Herzog used 
to routinely check Howard Johnson's bat, but Herzog was convinced the Mets 
somehow found a way to change bats before they reached the X-ray machine. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew it," Magrane said, "but we never could get proof." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, Cleveland's ill-fated attempt to switch bats revived memories for 
Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker, in charge of retrieving foul balls one night in '87, remembers seeing 
that a lot of balls he was collecting off Minnesota Twin starter Joe Niekro 
were scuffed. He informed Angel Manager Gene Mauch of his findings. Mauch told 
him to keep collecting them. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Mauch chose the right time to challenge Niekro, and lo and behold, an 
emery board fell out of his pocket. Parker was immediately instructed to take a 
half-dozen balls and put them in the umpire's room for evidence. Well, on his 
way there, he was rudely confronted by a Twin player, and for a moment, Parker 
thought he was in for a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared to death," Parker said, "but we got them there. I'm telling you, 
it was a night I'll never forget." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Angels, in an attempt to ensure they won't have to put right fielder Tim 
Salmon on the 15-day disabled list because of an aggravated right hamstring, 
are considering using him as a designated hitter for a few games and playing 
Chili Davis in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a possibility," Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann said, "but only if we can 
keep Chili in the lineup. I'm not going to take Chili out of the lineup, 
believe me." 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon, who sat out Monday's game and hopes he can return in a few days, 
realizes the Angels want to be cautious. Yet, he says, there is a greater fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that would stink," Salmon said, "is you give it time, and then just 
when I'm ready, we're going to go on strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "From their standpoint, it can take the whole season to heal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not going to miss the whole season." BOB NIGHTENGALE

WOLFE FINDS SAFE HARBOR, AWAY FROM TITAN TURMOIL; GYMNASTICS: AFTER A 
SUCCESSFUL BUT TUMULTUOUS 23 YEARS AT CAL STATE FULLERTON, HE DISCOVERS A LIFE 
AFTER COACHING THAT'S CLOSER TO HOME. 
</P>

<P>
 Dick Wolfe sat on a bluff overlooking the ocean. The Pacific surf lapped at 
the beach below. It was Southern California wearing its best dress. The Laguna 
coast, basking in July's warmth, was a gleaming backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe remembers the day three years ago when he was at that same spot, looking 
out to sea. "I remember seeing a boat go by," he said. "This may sound crazy, 
but you know what I thought? I had a strange feeling the people on that boat 
were coaches. Very soon they would go back into the gym and spend five or six 
hours a day coaching gymnastics. Don't ask me why I thought that, but that's 
what I thought. And I knew then I had to make myself realize that there are 
things in life other than coaching." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe, who is 55 today, said he had made up his mind at that point that his 
days coaching gymnastics at Cal State Fullerton were over. Until then, a big 
part of his life had revolved around that career. And, like other coaches, he 
was driven by an insatiable desire for his teams to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 They did. In his 23 years at Fullerton, the Titans won three college division 
national titles. They also won 10 consecutive conference championships. And 
when the program moved to the Division I level, Wolfe still produced top teams. 
He was nationally regarded as one of the sport's top coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 But the job became increasingly difficult because of budget cuts, and Wolfe 
was embroiled in one battle after another with school officials, resisting 
plans to eliminate the program entirely. Finally, he decided to throw in the 
towel. A year later, the school dropped the sport unceremoniously. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, however, Wolfe had found that there is, indeed, life after coaching. 
And he said he was determined to not look back. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took almost a full year for him to totally realize that," said his wife, 
Charlotte, a teacher at Irvine High. "I'm sure a lot of coaches don't think 
there really is another life when they stop coaching. I don't think he felt 
there was another person. His whole persona was tied to it. There's a 
transition period where they have to learn to let it go." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe said he had no interest in finding a job that would require him to move 
away from Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love Laguna, and I love the ocean," he said. "I'm one of those people who 
feel they have to be by the water. The ocean has a calming effect on me, and it 
helps me center myself." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't long before he found a new career as a personal trainer at a Laguna 
Beach gym and health club. It is something he enjoys, he said, and it has none 
of the time demands, pressures and emotional strain that frequently comes with 
coaching, whatever the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still feel as though I'm helping people develop themselves physically, even 
though the people I'm working with now are almost all over 40, instead of the 
young athletes I worked with as a coach," Wolfe said. 
</P>
<P>
 He still lives in the brown-shingled house built in 1910 that he moved into 18 
years ago. But there is a big difference now. 
</P>
<P>
 "My commute now is 0.9 miles," he said, smiling. "I don't even have to turn 
any corners to get to work. When I worked at Fullerton, I had a commute of 
almost an hour each way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of my friends tell me that I've probably added four or five years to my 
life by all this. Well, I think I've probably added at least 45 minutes to it. 
What I mean is that I don't worry much about those kinds of things." 
</P>
<P>
 He has more time for his young sons, and he's delighted about that. Tyler is 
13, Ryan, 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're both talented young athletes, and I'm glad I have more time to spend 
with them," Wolfe said. "When I was coaching I didn't have that kind of time to 
spend with my older son, Troy, who is 24 now. I tried to give him quality time, 
but I know now that was limited by coaching. I remember getting back from trips 
and waking him up in the night to play with him for a little while before I had 
to leave again early the next morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe says he avoids getting too involved in any coaching of his sons. Both 
are promising soccer players and compete in other sports, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only goals I have for them is that they learn from their day-to-day 
sports experiences," Wolfe said. "I want them to learn personal integrity and 
honor and to be straight forward with their friends. I encourage them to do 
what they want to do and don't push them to certain sports. I support them, but 
I won't drive them." 
</P>
<P>
 A few months ago, the National Assn. of Collegiate Gymnastics Coaches 
presented Wolfe their Honor Coach Award at the group's national convention in 
Lincoln, Neb. The ceremony brought back a lot of memories. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went and took my family," he said. "It was pretty emotional. There's a real 
fraternity among those coaches, all of us competing and trying to develop our 
programs. And I knew what I missed about coaching was the camaraderie and 
working with the athletes. No one really coaches for the money or the glory. 
You do it for the kids. It's a group commitment. When one person has a problem, 
everyone has a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe said receiving the award "closed the book" on his days as a coach, 
leaving him with no regrets. And a life with more balance. "If I were still 
coaching and sitting here today, I'd have my clipboard with me, ready to write 
down something I might think of about gymnastics or my team," Wolfe said. "I'd 
take it with me sometimes when my wife and I would go to a movie. I don't carry 
it at all anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 As he looks back, he knows that clipboard was a symbol of his unbridled 
intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was coaching, it was life and death, and I'd do anything to accomplish 
my goals," he said. "I don't define myself now in the kinds of ways that I did 
then. There's a life after coaching, and it's a good one." 
</P>
<P>
 The ocean behind him seemed calm.

COMMENTARY; WOMEN'S SPORTS NEED IDENTITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURLING LOWREY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Burling Lowrey is a free-lance writer 
in Washington, D.C., who specializes in sports culture. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Women's TV Sports Tug at Purse Strings," says a headline in the Washington 
Post. The piece that follows attempts to make a case for women's college 
basketball to be marketed to the hilt. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time that a flood of articles extolling the idea that women's 
Division I basketball had finally arrived, "60 Minutes" presented a devastating 
expose of the money-grubbing and hypocrisy that prevails in the men's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there something wrong here? Should the promoters of the women's game really 
be proud that they are on the road to matching all the vices of the men? 
</P>
<P>
 What are those wonderful elements in the men's game that the women seem so 
eager to emulate? They are evasive about the excessive demands placed on the 
student-athlete's time, an over-aggressive approach by coaches to get to the 
Final Four at any cost, a downplaying of academic achievement and an emphasis 
on promotion to bring in revenue, and a blatant conflict of interest among 
coaches, many of whose loyalty to shoe companies supersedes that toward the 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing better illustrates that women's college basketball is headed in the 
wrong direction than a "Frontline" documentary on PBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Ostensibly, the purpose of this report was to "look at the obstacles facing 
women's athletic programs in universities," but in actuality it was a best-case 
scenario, which followed the Stanford women's basketball team to two recent 
national championships. 
</P>
<P>
 I was, frankly, horrified at the manner in which "Frontline" unquestioningly 
spelled out what it considered the ingredients that make for a "successful" 
athletic program for women. What actually came across was an unintentional sick 
parody of all the human and institutional negatives of the men's Division I 
basketball factories. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the footage focused on the Stanford coach, Tara VanDerveer, a kind of 
female Vince Lombardi without the charisma. The image that she projected was 
that of a control freak who felt no qualms about telling her team, in no 
uncertain terms, "I want this national championship bad." Her manic drive to 
win, unrelieved by humor, was relentless. 
</P>
<P>
 As this hyped-up Stanford team rolled up the score on lesser opponents and 
marched on to the Final Four, the players, rather than enjoying the experience, 
became increasingly tense. When they got to the championship round, they were 
wound up so tightly that they seemed ready to roll on the floor, kicking and 
screaming. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming from all this that women's college basketball is on a slippery slope, 
what alternative to the men's game is there? Before answering, we need to 
examine the illogical reasoning that has marked the women's game as "inferior." 
Consider these arguments: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The women's game is too slow. The problem is that the men's game is too 
fast. The run-and-shoot game is not much fun to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The women can't dunk. Dunking is irrelevant, so far as good basketball 
goes. It is nothing more than an excuse for exhibitionism. The women are better 
off without it. Basketball was never intended to be played "above the rim." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The power element is missing in the women's game. So who needs it? The 
power game of the men is mindless. Without it, skill and intelligence are 
maximized. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Women's basketball does not bring in much revenue. Neither do fencing or 
badminton, but they are both world-class sports with a rich tradition and a 
loyal following.  
</P>
<P>
 The mad pursuit of Division I women to achieve semi-professional athletic 
status while supposedly getting an education is a horrendous mistake. 
Therefore, one can only wonder why they haven't come up with a viable 
alternative to what the basketball factories are producing. For starters, I 
would suggest the implementation of the following: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Forget about "March Madness" and getting to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reduce practice time, travel, and postseason play so athletes can 
concentrate on their studies. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Discourage from participation any woman who considers the college team a 
farm club for the pros. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hire coaches who favor the pronoun we rather than I , whose philosophy is, 
"We want to win, but we want to have fun doing so," rather than, "I want this 
win bad." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stop worrying about whether or not you are filling the arenas with 
revenue-producing fans. Play the game and enjoy the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Keep in mind: Our game is not inferior to that of the men. It is simply 
different. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the promoters of big-time women's college basketball will have to 
decide where their loyalty lies -- with their respective alma maters or with 
the TV networks, the shoe companies and the marketing CEOs of big corporations. 
Female college athletes say what they really want is respect. We shall see what 
path they choose to get it.

CLIPPERS NOT AMONG TEAMS WILKINS CONSIDERING -- AGENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Free-agent forward Dominique Wilkins has removed the Clippers from the list of 
teams he is considering, Steve Kauffman, Wilkins' agent, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't talked to the Clippers in ages," Kauffman said."Is anybody coaching 
that team yet? How do you get a free agent to sign with your team when you 
don't have a coach?" 
</P>
<P>
 Kauffman said that Wilkins, who became an unrestricted free agent on July 1, 
was contacted by 11 teams, and is weighing offers from six, including the 
Lakers and Boston Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Judge Kevin T. Duffy on Monday lifted a temporary restraining order 
that prohibited teams from signing free agents, but Kauffman said he was unsure 
whether Wilkins would sign immediately or wait until a new collective 
bargaining agreement is reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, 34, was seeking a $21-million, three-year deal from the Clippers, who 
originally offered him an $8-million, two-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper spokesman Joe Safety said the club, which recently acquired forward 
Malik Sealy from the Indiana Pacers and rookies Lamond Murray of California and 
Eric Piatkowski of Nebraska, had already decided to explore other options. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers can use Wilkins' 1993-94 salary slot of $3.5 million to sign 
another free agent.

MARCIULIONIS, HOUSTON ARE TRADED FOR PIERCE, ROGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Golden State Warriors acquired guard Ricky Pierce, the rights to Carlos 
Rogers and two second-round picks in the 1995 draft from the Seattle 
SuperSonics for guard Sarunas Marciulionis and forward Byron Houston in a trade 
announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-4 Pierce, a two-time Sixth Man Award winner with the Milwaukee 
Bucks, has averaged 16.4 points per game in 12 NBA seasons.The 34-year-old 
shooting guard averaged 14.5 points in 51 games last season with Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce currently ranks seventh as the most accurate free-throw shooter in the 
league's history, with an .876 average. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers, 23, was the 11th pick in the June draft. The 6-foot-11 forward-center 
from Tennessee State averaged 24.5 points, 11.5 rebounds and three blocked 
shots in 31 games last season. He was also chosen Ohio Valley Conference player 
of the year for the second consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
 "By acquiring Ricky Pierce and Carlos Rogers, we have added one of the NBA's 
best pure shooters and a young big man with tremendous potential," Warrior 
Coach Don Nelson said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson previously coached Pierce in Milwaukee from 1984-85 through the 1986-87 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although, from a basketball standpoint, we believe this trade significantly 
improves the makeup and depth of our team, this was a tough choice to make, 
personally, because it forces us to part company with two people I really 
admire both on and off the court," Nelson said. "Sarunas and Byron were among 
the fiercest and most inspirational players on our team." 
</P>
<P>
 Marciulionis has sat out 124 games the last two seasons because of a string of 
injuries. The 6-foot-5 Lithuanian sat out last season because of a torn 
anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. He averaged 14.7 points, 2.8 
rebounds and 2.4 assists in five seasons with the Warriors.

SOCCER / WORLD CUP REPORT; MEOLA LEAVES GOAL TO TRY HIS FOOT AS KICKER FOR JETS 
</P>

<P>
 Tony Meola, the starting goalkeeper for the U.S. national soccer team since 
1989, was signed by the New York Jets as a kicker, it was announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave Tony quite an extensive workout late last week and were really 
impressed by his leg strength and accuracy," said Dick Steinberg, the Jets' 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Meola, 25, from Kearny, N.J., was one of the high-profile members of the first 
U.S. team since 1930 to advance beyond the first round of the World Cup. He is 
second in international appearances for the United States with 89 and held 
eventual champion Brazil scoreless for the first 73 minutes of the Americans' 
1-0 loss in the second round of the World Cup. "He's a tough competitor who has 
played in some big games as an international soccer player," Jet Coach Pete 
Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Meola, who was once drafted by the New York Yankees as a center 
fielder, said this would be his final World Cup. At the time, he said he still 
might be willing to play in the pro league that is scheduled to start in the 
United States in April. 
</P>

<P>
 Sunday's World Cup final drew impressive television ratings locally and, 
although not as strong nationally, was probably the most-watched soccer game in 
U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC's coverage of the showdown between Brazil and Italy averaged a 12.4 rating 
in 32 markets for which ratings were available Monday. The national rating will 
not be available until Thursday, but it is expected to exceed the previous 
record of 9.3 for the U.S.-Brazil World Cup match July 4. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the Super Bowl last January had a 27.8, and last week's baseball 
All-Star game earned a 15.7. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere was the game more watched than in the market covering Los Angeles, 
Orange and Ventura counties, where it registered an 18.1 rating on KABC-TV 
Channel 7 and a 6.7 on Spanish-language KMEX-TV Channel 34 -- for a total 
viewership of more than 1.2 million homes, about 56% of all households watching 
TV between 12:30 and 3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Several Italian newspapers ran banner headlines saying: "Thanks Anyway." Other 
papers referred to the penalty kicks as a poker or roulette game that left the 
result to chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brazil: World Poker Champion," read a headline in La Gazzetta Dello Sport. 
"Goodby World Cup. The Unlucky Italy Loses in the Final Roulette," wrote 
Corriere della Sera, a Milan daily. 
</P>

 Adriana Galisteu, girlfriend of deceased Formula One driver Ayrton Senna, 
celebrated Brazil's victory in Lisbon, Portugal. The team had dedicated the 
tournament to Senna, who died in an accident while racing. . . . Cheering as if 
they had won the title, more than 100,000 soccer fans welcomed home Sweden's 
national soccer team in a raucous celebration of its third-place finish in the 
World Cup. . . . Brazil was named the tournament's most entertaining team. . . 
. Belgium's Michel Preud'homme was named the tournament's best goalkeeper.

MAKING A CHANGE FOR BETTER; AFTER 20 YEARS IN THE NFL, HENNING HAPPILY RETURNS 
TO COLLEGE COACHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From his second-floor window at Boston College, he is the master of all he 
surveys, even if that is mainly construction workers racing to put up 
grandstands by September. 
</P>
<P>
 It's what he has always wanted, but he didn't know it until he had it. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Dan Henning was 51 and out of work, in the middle of his life 
wondering what he was going to do with the rest of it. In March, he found out. 
</P>
<P>
 Or hopes he has. 
</P>
<P>
 It all started when Bill Parcells, coach of the New England Patriots, called. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill asked me if the Boston College coaching job came up, would I be 
interested," Henning said. "I thought it might be interesting. I hadn't thought 
about college." 
</P>
<P>
 After 20 years in the league, Henning had become disillusioned with pro 
football. "They might have become disillusioned with me, too," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston College needed a coach because Tom Coughlin had left to coach the NFL 
expansion Jacksonville Jaguars, and Chet Gladchuk, the school's athletic 
director, was seeking advice from Parcells, who became Father Football in New 
England the day he became the Patriots' coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The school needed a particular kind of coach because it would have more seats 
to fill next fall, about 46,000, in a sports-saturated city and Gladchuk likes 
offense. Doug Flutie had won the Heisman Trophy at Boston College in 1984, and 
his legacy was passing, points and fans in the seats. More recently there was 
Glenn Foley, who passed Boston College past Notre Dame last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was to find another Coughlin, get him to develop another Flutie or 
Foley and beat Notre Dame again. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the success that Tom Coughlin had here after being in pro football and 
then going back to pro football, I felt that we had to have a coach with a 
professional attitude," Gladchuk said. "When he left, my mind immediately went 
to pro football. I wanted somebody with professional experience, who had been 
an offensive coordinator, who had worked with quarterbacks." 
</P>
<P>
 Several NFL general managers, some of whom had sent children to Boston 
College, got calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple that I respected brought Dan's name up," Gladchuk said. "But they 
said, 'You'll never get him.' " 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, Gladchuk was selling exactly what Henning was buying, a place 
where he could be correct without having to be political. 
</P>
<P>
 And Henning was eminently hireable. He had been fired as offensive coordinator 
of the Detroit Lions midway through the 1993 season, with more than two years 
remaining on a contract that he says "pays me more than I make here." 
</P>
<P>
 He was playing golf in South Carolina and Florida, calling friends for ideas 
and being told by his children to get another football job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they thought I was going to drive them crazy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parcells had talked about the Patriots, but Henning told him not to invent a 
job for friendship's sake. After being fired from head coaching jobs in Atlanta 
and San Diego and from the Detroit assistant's position, pro football held 
little allure. Still, college football was a swamp from which he had escaped to 
the NFL after assistant jobs at Florida State and Virginia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason I became disillusioned with college football 20 years ago was 
because of a couple of situations in which we actually had discussions in staff 
meetings about how to lie, after a fashion," Henning said. "Even that wasn't as 
distasteful to me as, after we had a student-athlete for a year or so and we 
had evaluated him and recruited him and now we didn't feel he was very good, we 
weren't going to give him any help and keep him around. If he flunked out, he 
flunked out. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other hand, we might have one who might be worse off academically and 
might be even worse as a citizen, but who was a better football player, then we 
would go overboard to try to keep him around. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the way it is in the pros. You trade for a guy or draft him, and you 
live with all those personal problems as long as a guy's assets are higher than 
his liabilities. When the assets or liabilities change, you get rid of him." 
</P>
<P>
 But pro football made no pretense to be anything other than what it was. He 
didn't have to go into a living room and tell a mother or father that their 
athletically gifted son would be cared for and nurtured, not saying he would be 
dumped when others more gifted were found. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not like that any more, Gladchuk told him. In fact, it had better not be. 
A system of academic support was in place at Boston Collee. So was one of NCAA 
compliance. 
</P>
<P>
 There were four candidates, one of them the incumbent defensive coordinator, 
Steve Szabo, who taught preventing touchdowns, not scoring them. Gladchuk won't 
identify the others. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a consistency by the general managers I talked to in their respect 
for Dan in that he had fallen short in Atlanta, and in San Diego and even in 
Detroit," Gladchuk said. "But it seemed from what they were saying that maybe 
it wasn't all his fault." 
</P>
<P>
 Henning's forte is coaching quarterbacks. He had been one, at William and 
Mary, in minor league pro football and for a time with the Chargers. He had 
coached Don Strock at Virginia Tech, Joe Namath with the Jets, Joe Theismann, 
Doug Williams, Steve Bartkowski and Bob Griese. 
</P>
<P>
 The Super Bowl ring he wears at Boston College is testimony to his ability to 
coach them. 
</P>
<P>
 In Atlanta, he had David Archer; at San Diego, a disgruntled Jim McMahon and 
Billy Joe Tolliver. Henning had a 38-73-1 record as an NFL coach, in large part 
because of the Archers, McMahons and Tollivers. 
</P>
<P>
 At Detroit, he had a threesome -- Erik Kramer, Rodney Peete and Andre Ware, 
none of whom could hold the starting job. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was fired twice as an assistant (in Detroit and at Florida State), 
those two situations weren't scars, they were blessings," Henning said. "I had 
tried to leave and they wouldn't let me out of contracts. After I was let go, I 
went to church and said a prayer of thanks. 
</P>
<P>
 "At Atlanta, I wanted to win, especially for the (owner Rankin) Smith family, 
but I didn't. My situation as a head coach at San Diego -- Bobby Beathard (the 
Chargers' general manager) was a good friend of mine for many years. When he 
came in, I had two years left on my contract. That was brought up and I asked, 
'What's going to happen to me? You make these kinds of turnovers in personnel, 
it's going to be difficult to win, especially with turnover at the key 
positions.' I was told not to worry about it, or maybe it was this way, I was 
told I would be all right. I should have asked what all right was." 
</P>
<P>
 It was one more season and then out, acrimoniously so, to the cheers of the 
San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 But Beathard weighed in with a good reference two years after he had fired 
Henning, saying that the player talent wasn't there to win and that the city 
had turned on the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 And Joe Schmidt, Detroit's general manager, gave his support, calling Henning 
tough, but not very good politically. 
</P>
<P>
 When he called Henning, Gladchuk got a warm but tentative reception. Henning 
was assured that college football had changed in the 20 years he had been away. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, the scholarship limit was down to 85 and that meant more 
players were available to be spread among the Division I schools. 
</P>
<P>
 And the recruiting class was in place. It was one of the nation's best, 19 
players from 12 states, and it included Scott Mutryn of Cleveland St. Ignatius 
High, called by some the country's best high school quarterback last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the quarterbacks I had worked with, I had near the end of their 
careers," Henning said. "It would be nice to have one at the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 Henning's first call went to Vince O'Connor, his high school coach at St. 
Francis Prep in New York. O'Connor is still coaching there. Henning had come 
full circle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been recruited by Boston College out of high school in 1960," he said. 
"I wasn't accepted. I wasn't offered a scholarship." 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't fit the Eagles' standards. Now he sets them. 
</P>
<P>
 They will be high, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had never come close to cheating in the six years I was a college 
recruiter," he said. "I used to get kidded that I didn't bring in as many kids 
as the others. I tried to go after quality -- and I didn't bend the rules. 
Recruiting was a shady business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it sounds hokey, or it sounds naive. And maybe it is. But if I can get 
it done here, it will establish all of the beliefs I've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
 It's all so different. Different, and better. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the pros, a player might be gone the next day," Henning said. "Here, there 
are no side deals and there is no salary cap. . . . The commitment you have 
from (college players) seems a great deal higher to the team goals than to 
individual goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The level of play is different, but I feel the level isn't as important as 
much having a chance to implement your ideas without those ideas being crossed 
over so much by other people. Professional coaches always want to have control 
of personnel. I have that here." 
</P>
<P>
 It's what any coach wants. It's what no NFL coach has anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dan's a good coach," said John Robinson, the USC coach who, as did Henning, 
Bill Walsh and Holtz, came back to college football from the NFL. "He's going 
to be successful as a college coach because he understands the difference in 
the games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Recruiting is different. Evaluating kids at 17, 16, 18 years old when you are 
used to seeing players 24 to 30 years old is different. It's still teaching a 
game, though. It's just that you have to teach in less time. Where in the pros, 
you might say, 'I want to teach 15 things,' in college you find that you need 
to scale that down to 12 things and really have time for only seven or eight 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 Henning got a quick lesson in time management from spring football. The NCAA 
mandates no more than 20 hours a week during the season or spring can be spent 
on football. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know the college system had changed so much," Henning said. "It's so 
far afield of the way it was 20 years ago, when you could coach every day of 
the year. I know it's done to protect the student-athlete, but they should let 
the coach do his job. Still, the process had gotten out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
 A quarterback has been settled upon, sophomore Mark Hartsell winning out over 
Jeff Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahead lies a Sept. 3 date at Michigan and the home opener on Sept. 17 against 
Virginia Tech in the new stadium. Notre Dame comes to call on Oct. 8.

EXECUTIVE SUITE: COMPANY TOWN; TOM ROTHMAN WILL HEAD NEW FILM UNIT AT FOX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of speculation, 20th Century Fox on Monday named former Samuel 
Goldwyn Co. production chief Tom Rothman to head a new division that will 
produce and distribute movies for sophisticated adult audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you are seeing with this market -- the adult, educated, upscale market 
-- is that the ceilings are higher," Rothman said.He added that the film 
budgets will probably range from $5 million to $15 million, far below the 
nearly $30 million it usually costs to make a studio film. 
</P>
<P>
 The films also give Fox another source of product for parent News Corp., which 
has extensive worldwide television operations. Fox chief Peter Chernin said he 
expects the new unit to generate five or six films a year. "We're looking to 
figure out a sane way to increase our volume," Chernin said, noting that Fox 
also recently started a family films unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothman, 39, was involved in Goldwyn movies such as "Much Ado About Nothing" 
and "The Wedding Banquet." 
</P>
<P>
 * EastWest Records chief Sylvia Rhone is expected to be named today as 
chairman of Warner Music Group's Elektra/EastWest. The appointment of Rhone, 
who would retain her EastWest duties, has been expected since Bob Krasnow, 
Elektra's former chief, resigned last week in a Warner Music shake-up. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tracy Masington has left Universal Pictures, where she was director of 
national publicity. She will join Morgan Creek Productions as vice president of 
publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 * Edward Nassour has been named senior vice president of post production for 
20th Television's network television division. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rolf Eriksson was named to the dual positions of managing director of Warner 
Bros. Sweden and regional supervisor of Scandinavia by Warner Bros. 
International Theatrical Distribution.

FIXATIONS: HIGHER EDUCATION; WALKING ABOVE HIS O.C. HOME REMINDS 66-YEAR-OLD 
THAT LIFE'S A BALANCING ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's something to be said for unincorporated areas. In more civilized parts 
of the county, there are laws and rules designating what four weekends of the 
year one can have garage sales, or even how many minutes of the day your garage 
door can be open. Community associations can make folks tear down their ducky 
weather vanes, and La Habra is mulling an ordinance to prohibit hanging laundry 
in public view. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in the unincorporated hills above Tustin, two ungainly aluminum 
framework high-wire towers jut above Hendrik de Kanter's yard. Nearly every day 
his neighbors can see the 66-year-old out on them practicing his skill at 
tightrope walking. Sometimes he's on the wire on a bicycle or roller skates. 
Sometimes he is nude. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of the people here seem to have a certain amount of 
imagination," De Kanter says of his neighborhood. "They think it's just fine 
what I do." 
</P>
<P>
 De Kanter's ranch-style home lets you know he's interested in balance and 
suspension. Mobiles, including one made with old wrenches, hang on wires above 
his driveway. His stereo speakers hang off metal poles mounted in his 
fireplace. Sculptures and chunky mineral formations are cleverly balanced on 
elegantly simple stands he builds. A cassette deck, metronome and microphone 
float on wires in his living room above a Steinway grand piano, which, 
thankfully, is earthbound. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to suspend things," he said, with a touch of Dutch accent. "It's 
easier to clean under them." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a firm face and inquisitive eyes under his gray hair. Attired as he 
was in a blue jumpsuit and matching orange scarf and pocket handkerchief, he 
looked as if he'd stepped out of a Dragnet episode, a Dutch Hollywood Hills 
eccentric artist perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, for most of his life De Kanter has been an engineer and inventor. He 
was an advance design engineer on the Apollo space program and since the 1970s 
has headed his own company, which manufactures a machine that cuts glass tubing 
for use in electrical diodes. A widower since 1976, he also spends his time 
composing music, painting, skating and modeling -- clothed and otherwise -- for 
art classes. 
</P>
<P>
 And three years ago, at an age when many people are permanently bonding with 
their TV remote controls, De Kanter decided to take up tightrope walking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got to be 63 and it happened. I think I've always been a tightrope walker, 
but it took me this long to come out of the closet, to admit to myself that it 
was what I wanted to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, he didn't grow up with a love of circuses. But one year when he 
was a child in Holland, his industrialist father got a tightrope walker -- 
actually a Dutch variant on the practice called a cord dancer -- to perform at 
the annual factory variety show. De Kanter was entranced, and "I think ever 
since it's been in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago a neighbor who knew of his interest told him about high-wire 
artist Jay Cochrane, billed as "the Canadian Prince of the Air," who was then 
appearing weekly at Knott's Berry Farm. De Kanter saw Cochrane perform and was 
so impressed that he now says he reveres him, and keeps a photo of his 
tightrope shoes. After De Kanter pestered him for two weeks, Cochrane, in turn, 
was impressed enough with his sincerity that he agreed to give him a lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 That invaluable 2 1/2-hour lesson in De Kanter's back yard formed the basis 
for what he's done since. He works on his wires an average of 15 minutes a day 
-- for hours some days and others not at all -- with the present goal of being 
able to walk safely along the seven-sixteenths-of-an-inch steel cable without 
use of a balancing bar.  
</P>
<P>
 He has three wires running in the yard. There aren't kits for such things, so 
he had to design and build them from scratch. "It helps to be an engineer," he 
advises. One wire is barely a foot above the ground, for practicing, and 
directly above it is an 11-foot-high wire. They are 31 feet long. If one were 
to fall, there is a lawn to one side and a rock garden to the other. The third 
wire, 38 feet long, is strung over a cliff drop in the yard, making it an 
18-foot drop to the cactus patch below.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's just a reminder that you want to stay on the wire, given the choice," 
he said. We did mention, didn't we, that he does this naked sometimes? 
</P>
<P>
 He has kept a log of his air time and estimates he has navigated the 
18-foot-high wire 736 times, adding up to several miles traveled on a cable 
thinner than a pinkie. He's never fallen and doesn't expect to. 
</P>
<P>
 He said: "One of the things you learn, and this applies to life, is you don't 
want to take risks beyond your capabilities. So you start out low. Once you 
feel comfortable at that height and know you can stay on the wire, regardless 
of flies buzzing, cats running under the wire, someone shouting or whatever, or 
misplacing your foot a little, then you go higher and higher." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of our conversation took place while De Kanter was on his 11-foot-high 
wire, and he chatted away, making it seem effortless. I had a few goes at his 
foot-high wire though, and it was anything but easy. There was a whole set of 
necessary brain-to-body communications (what De Kanter refers to as a 
"neuromuscular program") I didn't have on line. Nearly every muscle tensed up 
as the wire quivered underfoot like a taut bowstring. Just standing still on 
the thing was exhausting, and moving was a series of near-disasters.  
</P>
<P>
 De Kanter said I did pretty well for a first timer. But if I'd been doing as 
well on the high wire I'd probably be having to type this story with my nose.  
</P>
<P>
 De Kanter says he didn't walk into his hobby blind to its risks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd done some parachute jumping, so I knew what it was to be facing the abyss 
of death from a height. And when I started going up high doing this, I 
complained to Jay over the phone one day that I still had fear. He said, 'Good, 
that's what keeps you alive.' 
</P>
<P>
 "On the wire I feel that's as close as we come to being a bird. At the same 
time I'm always glad when it's over. It takes all you have physically. You have 
to always have a certain tenseness. I know if I don't concentrate I'll be 
punished severely by the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 In traversing a wire that's barely off the ground or one that's 18 feet, or 
even 250 feet high, "the only difference lies above the neck, meaning there is 
a difference, but it's all psychological. The wire is your point of reference, 
wherever it is." 
</P>
<P>
 He has no particular ambition to join Cochrane and the other experts at the 
real heights, though it is one of his goals to attain the assuredness on the 
wire to be able to do that if he chose to. More immediate goals are mastering 
his high-wire bicycle and skate techniques and working on walking the wire 
without a balancing pole, which is a far more difficult proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 His house abounds with original artworks, and he keeps a scrapbook of photos 
of art students' better representations of his unadorned self. When he answers 
the phone, he announces, "De Kanter speaking!"  
</P>
<P>
 He's often busy trying to leave his mark on things, from his modification of a 
cordless phone to attach to his head "so 50% of my dexterity isn't used up just 
holding it" to his work-in-progress for a two-wheeled car that "has all the 
comforts of the car with a motorcycle so there isn't that ridiculous waste." He 
admits to a certain desire to be noticed and says the tightrope walking helps 
fulfill that. He's appeared the last two years at the Tustin Tiller Days 
festivities, at a Federation of Netherlands Organizations meet in Long Beach 
and at other events ranging down to a neighborhood chili cook-off.  
</P>
<P>
 "It has to do with self-acceptance, self-worth and self-esteem. It's a good 
ego booster, without having the attitude of saying, 'I'm better than you are.' 
I'm just saying I'm proud to share what I'm doing. I think you could also call 
it a mild form of exhibitionism," he said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To him, being on the wire is more than just a metaphor for life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life is a matter of balance. It is a series of risks and challenges, and it 
is a matter of concentration, and all that you experience physically when 
you're on the wire." 
</P>
<P>
 He often wonders what his wife, who died in an accident in 1976, would have 
thought of his tightrope walking. He hasn't remarried and says: "She was the 
kind of person you think of every day. I do, and many of my friends tell me 
they do too. I have a feeling I've never worked her death out with myself and 
I'd just as soon not think about it. I like to think of the days that were so 
good.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was very difficult for me for a time, but with or without her, I think 
life is so beautiful -- I always try to exercise what God has given me in the 
way of talents. That very thing, I think, helped me enormously to get over it." 
</P>
<P>
 He feels sorry for people who, as they grow older, cease to take on new 
challenges.  
</P>
<P>
 "Life is safer that way," he said, "but it might not be living. I think there 
is a little bit of the inventor in all of us, but some of us were fortunate to 
choose to make out a living with it. If you have an inventive mind, there is 
hardly anything that isn't interesting, though that always depends on how much 
effort you're willing to put into finding out more about things. It would be 
terrible punishing, wouldn't it, to let go of pursuits."

STEPPING UP TO THE PLATE WITH 'DIAMOND'; BOOKS: MARK HARRIS LOVES BASEBALL. BUT 
THE AUTHOR WHO'S WELL-KNOWN FOR HIS NOVELS ABOUT THE SPORT WOULD RATHER WRITE 
ABOUT IT THAN WATCH IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the evening after a 116-degree day, pipes from the grandstand roof spray a 
cool mist over the fans. Mark Harris sits behind the third base dugout at 
Scottsdale Stadium. Harris -- who wrote what many consider two of the finest 
baseball novels ever, "Bang the Drum Slowly" and "The Southpaw" -- doesn't know 
the names of any players on the home team Phoenix Firebirds. He doesn't know 
how the team is doing this season. 
</P>
<P>
 He talks little about the game until a great play gets his attention. "Oh, 
good stop!" he exclaims when a second baseman races behind the base to snare a 
bouncing ball and nip a runner at first.  
</P>
<P>
 In the middle of a conversation, he pauses again to watch. "Nice play," he 
says when a charging outfielder scoops up a ball and holds a lead runner at 
second base after a batter bloops a single. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris never reads sports statistics or watches a full game on television and 
can name only about 20 major league players. But he loves baseball and seeing 
it played well. 
</P>
<P>
 "People ask me, 'Are you a fan? How many games do you go to every year? Of 
course you have season tickets,' " Harris writes in "Diamond" (Donald I. Fine), 
a new collection of his baseball essays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand how disappointing I become when I say I see only a game or two a 
year. . . . I admire the game of baseball, but I am not necessarily a fan of 
any of the people who play it or of the cities they pretend to represent. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "If I have something illuminating to say, I go home and write it." 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping up with baseball minutiae would take time from his writing, he says. 
The 71-year-old author works in a spare office at the rear of a white-on-white 
Southwestern-style home filled with art. His wife, Josephine, a devoted 
baseball fan, calls him for important moments in televised games. 
</P>
<P>
 At home before the Firebirds game, Harris sits behind his desk, a hand folded 
behind his head, a foot propped on a stool. He wears glasses with two sets of 
lenses, one of which he flips down for distance.  
</P>
<P>
 "If I don't work a couple of hours in the evening, I've missed a session," he 
says. "And if you miss too many, you fall out of the habit." 
</P>
<P>
 When he needs details or statistics, he looks them up. Otherwise he relies on 
knowledge developed growing up on playgrounds and reading between the lines of 
newspaper stories about his beloved New York Giants of the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I look back, I can see so many scenes that arise out of memory," he 
says. He's maintained these memories by writing in a journal about his daily 
activities for five minutes every evening since 1934. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris prefers writing about baseball because it's the sport he knows best, he 
says, not because the players outshine other athletes. He discusses the part 
baseball has played in his life and the creation of his four baseball novels in 
"Diamond," a series of essays written between 1946 and 1993. The work is half 
of a literary doubleheader with "The Tale Maker," a novel published 
simultaneously by Fine, in which Harris traces the careers of an aspiring 
writer and a would-be literary critic at a large university. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Harris' 13th novel. He has also written four works of autobiographical 
nonfiction, four screenplays, a play and numerous essays and reviews. Although 
he would like to be recognized for all his works, he realizes that he is best 
known for the baseball novels: "It's sort of inevitable that many writers get 
identified as one thing or another." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris is famed most for four novels based on the career of left-handed 
pitcher Henry Wiggen: "The Southpaw" (1953), "Bang the Drum Slowly" (1956), "A 
Ticket for Seamstitch" (1957) and "It Looked Like For Ever" (1979). "Bang the 
Drum Slowly" became a 1973 motion picture starring Robert DeNiro and Michael 
Moriarity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cordelia Candelaria, a professor with Harris at Arizona State University and 
author of "Seeking the Perfect Game: Baseball in American Literature," rates 
"The Southpaw" and "Bang the Drum Slowly" among the top five baseball novels 
ever written, along with Bernard Malamud's "The Natural," Philip Roth's "The 
Great American Novel" and Robert Coover's "The Universal Baseball Association 
Inc." 
</P>
<P>
 Candelaria says Harris' contribution to American literature is not limited to 
his baseball writing, but his major influence is through the character of 
Wiggen. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's every bit as permanent and important as Huckleberry Finn, as Ishmael and 
Ahab in 'Moby Dick' and as Nick Adams in Hemingway's short stories," Candelaria 
says. "Henry Wiggen struggles with his individuality, his place in society and 
the moral dilemmas he faces. All of those struggles are as much about him as an 
American character as they are about baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 "The other impressive thing is that Harris has written four novels about 
baseball," says Prof. Harley Henry, who has taught courses on baseball fiction 
since the 1970s at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn. "That shows that he 
knows how to use this material in a consistent way. Most people who write 
baseball fiction do it once and do with it what they want and then they go on." 
</P>
<P>
 Henry says Ring Lardner's "You Know Me Al" stories in 1914 made baseball the 
subject of serious fiction. Malamud's mythological "The Natural" in 1952 and 
Harris' realistic "The Southpaw" a year later created the serious baseball 
novel and unleashed a torrent of baseball fiction, including "The Great 
American Novel," "The Universal Baseball Association Inc." and W.P. Kinsella's 
"Shoeless Joe." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris differs from many later novelists in that he writes about baseball 
realistically, "without trying to connect it to all kinds of mythological 
systems and illusions," Henry says. 
</P>
<P>
 He contrasts the realism of "Bang the Drum Slowly," describing a major league 
team in a pennant race, with the 1982 "Shoeless Joe" (which became the movie 
"Field of Dreams" in 1989), a story of an Iowa farmer who builds a baseball 
diamond in his cornfield and magically brings back a legendary old-time star. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't stand fantasy, especially in baseball," Harris says. "It has to be 
real for me. I think people make fantasy of it who don't know how it works 
realistically. That is a demand I made when I was a kid -- that baseball has to 
be done right." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Harris developed this creed growing up on the playgrounds of Mt. Vernon, N.Y., 
near New York City, where he played baseball every spare moment, and where 
playing felt wonderful. "I knew . . . the wondrous physical feel of the 
movements of the game -- a ball well fielded, cleanly played, perfectly thrown; 
best of all, solidly hit," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that was unity with teammates and the possession of their confidence. 
"Somewhere, some years in the past, I am playing my position. I think I am 
playing shortstop. Two men are out. The batter hits a pop fly," he writes in 
"Diamond." 
</P>
<P>
 "Even before I gather it in I feel around me my teammates begin to jog toward 
the bench. They know that I am going to catch that ball. . . . They know my 
skills side by side with my limitations. And I know theirs. We are bonded. 
Baseball was bonding." 
</P>
<P>
 "Diamond" contains touching profiles of Dick Stuart, whose only polished 
baseball skill in his minor league days in the mid-1950s was hitting home runs, 
and of Japanese-American outfielder Fibber Hirayama of the Hiroshima Carp. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a portrait of the "fluent and brilliant and honest" late baseball 
commissioner and Yale President Bart Giamatti, and a defense of Pete Rose, whom 
Giamatti suspended from baseball for gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sympathetic vignette, Harris recalls the ovation after Rose's 4,192nd 
hit, breaking Ty Cobb's record. Rose became "a lonely, confused figure as the 
ovation swelled. 'I didn't know what to do,' he said later. 'I've never been on 
a ball field and not known what to do.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Humor is never far below the surface. In one piece Harris recalls that as a 
youth, he objected to "Casey at the Bat" on strategic grounds: With first base 
open, the pitcher should have walked Casey. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Harris began writing essays and novels early and later pursued scholarly 
expertise on literature. 
</P>
<P>
 He was born Mark Harris Finkelstein. When he graduated from high school in 
1940, he believed it would be hard for a Jew to get a job and dropped his 
surname, without protest from his father. 
</P>
<P>
 Drafted into the Army in 1943, Harris was sent to Camp Wheeler in Georgia. He 
was upset by a friend's death in battle overseas and outraged by segregation in 
the armed forces. He deserted his company, was hospitalized for psychoneurosis 
and given an honorable discharge. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked as a reporter and, in 1946, married Josephine, who persuaded him to 
try college at age 26. By the time he completed his doctorate degree in 
American studies at the University of Minnesota in 1956, he had published four 
books, including "The Southpaw" and "Bang the Drum Slowly." 
</P>
<P>
 The seed for "Bang the Drum Slowly" was planted when a graduate school 
classmate died. "I was 30," he says. "I hadn't encountered many deaths. It was 
shocking. In World War II many boys had died, but it wasn't like someone I'd 
seen a week or two before." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris transplanted the event to a major league clubhouse and wrote about a 
quarreling team that unifies and wins the pennant when it discovers a 
marginally talented catcher is dying of Hodgkin's Disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris has used teaching as a base for his writing career since 1954 at 
universities including San Francisco State College, California Institute of the 
Arts, Immaculate Heart College in Los Angeles, the University of Southern 
California and the University of Pittsburgh. He and his wife moved West in 1980 
to be closer to their three grown children. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he watches few games, Harris plays softball on a team with colleagues 
at Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball as amateurs play it is seldom exciting to watch," he says in 
"Diamond," "but it is exciting to play, as anyone can tell you who has whacked 
the ball well or caught a fly ball on the run. One understands the game by 
playing it. It is good exercise for the body and the head and the spirit and 
the outlook."

A TIME FOR DYING?; RATHER THAN FACE A HORRIBLE, LINGERING DEATH, SOME AIDS 
PATIENTS SAY THEY PLAN TO END THEIR LIVES. FOR THEM, IT'S A WAY OF KEEPING 
CONTROL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE KNOWLTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During the day, Joe Miller stays busy helping AIDS patients. At night, the 
catheter delivering a medley of medications to his emaciated body reminds him 
that he, too, shares their fate. 
</P>
<P>
 But Miller, who has been in and out of the hospital nine times in as many 
years, doesn't plan to let the disease take him all the way down to dementia or 
some other horrible finale as it has done to so many of his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 With poison he has obtained, Miller will be able to kill himself before AIDS 
does. "I'm not a victim," he says. "Victims have no control. I'm going to be in 
control until the point of dying." 
</P>
<P>
 By some estimates, more than half of the 360,000 AIDS patients currently 
diagnosed in the United States have made preparations to end their lives when 
-- and if -- they decide the time is right. 
</P>
<P>
 Coast to coast, they hoard powerful medications -- a ritual called 
"stockpiling" -- or plan other methods, such as the plastic-bag suffocation 
described in the best-selling suicide primer "Final Exit." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite public uneasiness with euthanasia and in defiance of laws against 
assisting with suicide, many recruit relatives or friends to help, should they 
become too incapacitated. Others ask their medical care givers to assist. 
</P>
<P>
 And while most will never carry out their plans, at least 1,000 have done so, 
says Dr. Peter Marzuk, a Cornell University psychiatrist who has studied 
suicide rates in AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "It goes on a lot more now because they're just not dying as quickly as they 
used to," says psychoanalyst Mark Blechner, founder of the HIV Clinical Service 
at the William Alanson White Institute in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that we're treating the diseases that used to kill them early, they're 
getting to a state of such deterioration," Blechner says. "They're really very 
ill and really, really suffering." 
</P>
<P>
 "People live longer and more uncomfortably because medical science has 
intervened in every illness," says Los Angeles resident Gary Costa, 32, who was 
diagnosed HIV positive in 1985 but still is healthy. "Nature didn't intend us 
to live so long." 
</P>
<P>
 As program director of Being Alive: People With AIDS Coalition, Costa knows 
hundreds of HIV-positive people and AIDS patients in Los Angeles. He says most 
have stockpiled drugs and made pacts with others to help if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've stocked enough morphine to wipe out a family of 10," he says. "It's my 
emergency stash in case I have to go out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Costa and others find comfort in making preparations to keep their options 
open. But that doesn't make it easy for anyone when the time comes. 
</P>
<P>
 He'll never forget an October morning in 1985, the day he refused to help his 
partner die. 
</P>
<P>
 "He couldn't breathe, he was blind and his whole quality of life was gone," 
Costa recalls. "We'd had a pact that I'd give him a lethal injection but I 
freaked. I just couldn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The man, angry, sent Costa to the store to buy ice cream. Then he dialed 911 
and shot himself fatally in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard the sirens and saw the ambulance as I was coming home," Costa says. 
"And I knew. He'd called 911 so I wouldn't have to be the one to find him." 
</P>
<P>
 He has come to terms with that event, he says, and stresses that most of the 
67 people he knows who have died ultimately did not take their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the availability of morphine at home and good home care, they've opted 
to ease out naturally," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he fears what could lie ahead for himself. That's why he has arranged 
with a friend who he knows will be able to carry out his wishes should he 
choose to die. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm asymptomatic now and don't know what the future holds for me," he says. 
"But I don't take being sick very well and I just want to know it'd be over 
quick. As I deal with it all, I can get comfortable knowing I won't have to 
suffer." 
</P>
<P>
 He believes it's the fact that he has made provisions for his death that keeps 
him healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can go on with my life now," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the closest relationships, views of the suicide option are split. 
Costa's partner is Kyle Burton, 36, a Los Angeles special-event planner. Unlike 
Costa, he has no plans to try to control the timing of his death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm definitely going to kick until the end," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Burton, whose condition was diagnosed in France seven years ago, says once he 
got past the "mental hell of the first two years," he started to feel better. 
He's now almost blind in one eye, suffers from Kaposi's sarcoma (cancerous skin 
lesions) and has been hospitalized with a collapsed lung, but he still feels 
excellent, he reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to live," he says. "I'm not going to be the first one to jump in and 
kill myself. I might break down, but doctors can usually fix it." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he stresses, he "100% supports" anyone who feels differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only difference between them and me is I have no set way out," he says. 
"But I know my mother will know when it's time to turn off the (life support) 
machine if it gets really bad. She knows I don't want to become a dribbling 
responsibility with no quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows for sure how many AIDS patients die by their own hands, with or 
without help, but several studies indicate that people with the disease are at 
high risk for suicide, says Marzuk, an assistant professor of psychiatry at 
Cornell University Medical College in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's higher than with cancer but on a par with elevated rates found in 
patients of Huntington's disease and major mental illnesses such as 
schizophrenia and depression," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Marzuk, who in 1988 published a study showing that male AIDS patients are 36 
times more likely to commit suicide than similarly aged men without AIDS, says 
most subsequent studies put the rate anywhere from 10 to 20 times that of the 
general population. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these studies underestimate the true numbers," he says. "Many deaths are 
not suspected or reported as suicides. It's just impossible to say how many. 
Given the interaction of biological, social and psychological factors, it's 
actually surprising more people don't kill themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 But even though he understands the motivation, Marzuk is opposed to suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think encouraging it is opening a Pandora's Box," he says. "Why limit it to 
the physical terminal illnesses? What about terminal homelessness, longstanding 
emotional problems? It could go beyond any normal limit." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't call this suicide," says Judith Rabkin, a psychologist at Columbia 
University who for six years has studied HIV and depression. "There's a 
distinction between suicide where someone jumps out the window after hearing 
the news or -- when death is impending -- choosing to control the time of 
death. It's a very different event." 
</P>
<P>
 She questions judgments people make about how much other people should suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our culture it's considered brave to hang in until death. But when you 
talk to AIDS patients about others who've killed themselves, they say 'I wish I 
had their courage.' Maybe it's equally brave to not accept (this suffering.)" 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Lewis, a Lutheran pastor with the AIDS Project Los Angeles' spiritual 
advisory committee, recalls one extremely ill client who, with his family's 
support, arranged for a nurse friend to give him an overdose of morphine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very difficult time because he was very afraid," Lewis says. The 
patient, 29, no longer able to swallow or talk, communicated by pointing to 
alphabet letters pasted on cardboard. "He just wanted reassurance from me that 
it wouldn't be bad (to end his life), that he wouldn't be judged. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, frankly, 'Letting you move into the next plane is better than what 
you're experiencing now.' It was a very simple statement, but it calmed him 
down and brought him peace." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Inside a former tenement building, Joe Miller, 50, sits on the single bed in 
his small and immaculate apartment. Classical music plays softly as he talks 
about the past decade of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in 1985, while teaching English in South Korea, that his body suddenly 
turned black and blue. After seeing a doctor who prescribed penicillin and deer 
antler powders, he went to the International Hospital in Seoul, where a Danish 
doctor told him: "You have AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't get depressed, I got panicky," he says, lighting a cigarette. "Not 
that I was going to die, but that I was going to be very ill." 
</P>
<P>
 He returned to the United States, had his spleen removed, took a job as an 
AIDS educator at Beth Israel Hospital in New York and was "pretty much OK" for 
three years, he says. Then, while AIDS fund-raising in Los Angeles, he 
developed pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, a viral disease common to AIDS. Six 
weeks after that hospitalization, he contracted the same pneumonia again. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was it," he says. "I couldn't work anymore at a regular paying job." 
</P>
<P>
 As he goes down the list of what happened after that -- yet another bout with 
the pneumonia, a diabetic coma, three infections from the catheter, the loss of 
50 friends, the wasting syndrome that so far has cost him 30 pounds, bacterial 
infection that rages in his intestines, eight different medications he 
currently takes, the time his lymph nodes "exploded" -- he exhibits not a shred 
of self-pity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all have so many things," he says. "You just deal with them as they come 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 Today it is Miller's work that gives him the most satisfaction. For the past 
four years, he has been a volunteer at the People With AIDS Coalition hot line. 
He also runs an AIDS task force at the Unitarian Church of All Souls, which 
coordinates several support groups and a meal program. 
</P>
<P>
 He won't say where he got the poison with which he may -- with the help of a 
trusted friend if necessary -- inject himself someday, but he says he spent 
months thinking and talking to counselors, loved ones and friends about how to 
control the timing of his death. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, Miller says, is that there are no easy and accessible ways to end 
one's life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a very lucky person," he says, knocking on his wooden table three times 
to keep bad luck away. "I've had incredible, competent and caring support. I 
count myself blessed on that level. But when I'm no longer capable of 
sustaining meaningful life, I'll end it."

BODY WATCH; GET WELL SOON; WHAT YOU KNOW BEFORE SURGERY CAN HASTEN RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN O. RYAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Before the Big Day 
</P>
<P>
 The better prepared you are for surgery, the more quickly and completely you 
will recover. It is important to learn all you can about the procedure and 
prepare yourself, your home, your family and your employer for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some tips. 
</P>
<P>
 * The better your physical condition before surgery, the quicker you'll 
recover. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go into your surgery well-nourished," says Kathy Carder, a registered nurse 
who works with critical-care patients at Santa Monica Hospital. "Protein is 
necessary for the antibodies and cells that fight infection. Calories, vitamins 
and minerals are also very important. Before and after surgery is not the time 
to diet." 
</P>
<P>
 Carder also suggests that patients who smoke try to stop at least two weeks 
before surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Bathrooms can be dangerous for all but the most physically fit patients," 
says Dr. Hilary Siebens, assistant medical director for the Department of 
Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remove all throw rugs, and find out if you'll need a stool in the tub or 
shower. Consider moving your bedroom to the first floor during recovery," she 
says. "Find out if you'll need help with self-care while recuperating." 
</P>
<P>
 * Siebens suggests that patients and families discuss how their roles will 
change after surgery. Delegating who will manage finances, household chores and 
children should be discussed before surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Families also need to consider what will happen if full recovery is not 
possible or your surgery uncovers a more serious problem or terminal illness," 
Siebens says. 
</P>
<P>
 * Let your employer know how much time you anticipate being gone. Tie up loose 
ends and find out who will take over your work duties. Arrange for your wages 
to be picked up or deposited directly to your bank account. Ask how much your 
insurance company will cover of your procedure and post-operative care, 
especially if special help or equipment becomes necessary during recovery.  
</P>
<P>
 * Find out if you will need a blood transfusion. Ask what your options are. 
</P>
<P>
 * Find out what your post-surgical medications will be and see if you can 
purchase them ahead of time. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stock up on groceries, toiletries, pet food, stationery and stamps. Get 
enough to last six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cook extra food and freeze meal-size portions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Have lists of household instructions posted for any helpers coming to your 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 * Arrange transportation for incoming helpers and post-operative trips to the 
doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Alert your postal carrier if you'll be confined to the house. Ask if he or 
she will pick up outgoing mail. 
</P>
<P>
 * Take care of banking and bills ahead of time or arrange to do it by 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 * Get some of those back-burner projects that you've been waiting to do 
organized and ready to tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 * Purchase reading materials. After It's Over 
</P>
<P>
 Ever wonder why patients who have just been through surgery are forced to sit 
up, stand up or walk as early as the day after surgery? 
</P>
<P>
 Although exercise of any kind in the few days after surgery may feel like 
torture, "Movement is extremely important after surgery," Santa Monica 
Hospital's Carder says. "Early walking is most effective in preventing skin 
breakdown, blood clots, pneumonia and constipation." 
</P>
<P>
 Movement is so important that patients who cannot walk are generally turned 
side to side by a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 "While bed rest is very important, the body loses muscle strength, flexibility 
and cardiopulmonary stamina, which is reversible through exercise," Siebens of 
Cedars-Sinai says. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you are at home, alternate periods of rest and activity, and don't worry 
if you're sleeping more, Carder says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tissues heal faster during sleep," she says. "Some days you may feel great; 
others, worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Carder warns that pain can prevent necessary deep breathing, movement and 
sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't be afraid to ask for sufficient pain medication," she says. "Drug 
addiction almost never happens because of surgery and you must move." 
</P>
<P>
 Attitude plays a big part in the recovery process.

 "For some patients, coping with recovery is straightforward; others deal with 
many mood swings," Siebens says. "Find someone to talk to about your feelings. 
If depression persists, seek some help." 
</P>
<P>
 More ways to a speedy recovery include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Psyche yourself up and remember the big picture. 
</P>
<P>
 * Learn what signs of infection look like. 
</P>
<P>
 * Know the side effects of your medicines. 
</P>
<P>
 * Have telephone numbers handy for medical personnel who can answer your 
questions. A good number to have is that of the nurses station of the hospital 
floor you stayed on. Someone who may be familiar with your case is there 24 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep post-operative instructions handy for you and anyone assisting you. 
</P>
<P>
 * Watch your fatigue level. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you're walking with crutches or a cane, use a carpenter's apron with many 
pockets to help carry things. A patient using a walker can attach a basket. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stick to your doctor's recommendations regarding exercise. Overdoing it can 
hurt you. 
</P>
<P>
 * Encourage non-stressful visitors. Talk to people who will make you laugh. 
When someone asks what they can do to help, tell them. 
</P>
<P>
 * If family or friends are running errands, ask to go along for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tackle a few projects you've been putting off. Organize a photo album, start 
a journal, catch up on correspondence or computer work. 
</P>
<P>
 * Splurge on books, magazines and crossword puzzles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Order in a pedicure. 
</P>
<P>
 * Indulge in a soap opera. 
</P>
<P>
 * Learn a new card game. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do a jigsaw puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
 * Get some fresh air daily. 
</P>
<P>
 * Set daily goals -- but within reason. Visualize yourself doing something 
that recovery is keeping you from now and work toward that goal. Best Advice 
From the Doctors 
</P>
<P>
 There's no doubt that recovery from any surgery can be a challenge. The 
doctors we spoke to overwhelmingly said that the best route to recovery is good 
planning and understanding of the proposed surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what else they suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Kim Bader, OB-GYN; Glendale: 
</P>
<P>
 As a practicing obstetrician-gynecologist, I work exclusively with women. 
Surgeries are diverse -- from Cesarean sections to hysterectomies to 
infertility surgeries. The preparations for each are as different as the 
outcomes. 
</P>
<P>
 What few women consider before their surgery is how their role at home will 
change during the recovery period. If you are the primary caregiver, cook and 
bottle washer, your role is about to change drastically. 
</P>
<P>
 With any surgery, you will need some sort of help in the early days of 
recovery. Plan for it. If you are coming home with a brand-new baby, not only 
will you need assistance, but you should consider how your family dynamic will 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Michael B. Van Scoy-Mosher, oncologist; Cedars-Sinai Medical Center: 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best steps toward a healthy recovery is to focus on the long-term 
benefits of the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 Find a surgeon who is not only knowledgeable and skilled, but has your best 
interest at heart. Make sure he or she will spend sufficient time explaining 
your procedure, and don't be shy about seeking second opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember that the human body rebels against surgery and will send strong 
messages of its displeasure. Remarkably, the body does know how to heal itself, 
and in time normal life can be resumed. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Schoen, Ph.D., psychologist; UCLA School of Medicine: 
</P>
<P>
 How you prepare mentally before and after your surgery will profoundly affect 
your recovery. Some important points to consider are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Control. Establish a sense of control before and after your surgery by 
becoming a part of the decision process. Ask questions about the procedure, 
anesthesia and recovery period. 
</P>
<P>
 * Relaxation. Stress interferes with our immune system; therefore healing is 
enhanced when the body is in a relaxed state. Useful tools before and after 
surgery include self-hypnosis, meditation and prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Suggestion. Studies show that hypnotic suggestions given while under 
anesthesia have helped to shorten hospital stays and lessen the need for pain 
medications. Patients can listen to tape-recorded suggestions prior to surgery 
and in the recovery room. 
</P>
<P>
 * Support. It is comforting and reassuring to know there is someone we can 
rely on following surgery. Have someone available who will not only be helpful 
after surgery but will be an advocate for your health. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Michael J. Patzakis, professor and chairman, USC School of Medicine, 
Department of Orthopedic Surgery: 
</P>
<P>
 Maximizing functional independence following orthopedic surgery is essential. 
I suggest patients ask the following questions: 
</P>
<P>
 * Will I need crutches, cane, wheelchair or other devices? 
</P>
<P>
 * Will I need a cast or splint, and for how long? 
</P>
<P>
 * Will I need physical therapy or an exercise program? 
</P>
<P>
 * Will I have to keep certain limbs elevated? 
</P>
<P>
 * How do I avoid complications? 
</P>
<P>
 * What functional level can I expect after surgery? 
</P>
<P>
 * What is the length of my convalescence? 
</P>
<P>
 Patients who are immobile should plan ways to occupy their time. If you will 
not have assistance once you reach home, ask your doctor to arrange appropriate 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. P.K. Shah, director of In-Patient Cardiology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center; 
professor of medicine, UCLA School of Medicine: 
</P>
<P>
 After uncomplicated heart surgery, many patients are ready to return to work 
in eight to 10 weeks. The success of that recovery depends on a heart-healthy 
diet, exercise and a positive outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 At home, patients are encouraged to continue their prescribed exercise therapy 
and progressively increase the duration and number of sessions a day throughout 
the next four to six weeks. Patients are also encouraged to begin a casual 
walking routine, progressively increasing speed and duration. 
</P>
<P>
 Once patients return to work, they should continue to participate in an 
organized exercise program that offers instruction on modifying heart disease 
risk factors. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Lee S. Berk, psychoneuroimmunologist at Loma Linda School of Medicine and 
School of Public Health: 
</P>
<P>
 Laughter may truly be the best medicine. It is well-known that any of the 
hormones we produce when we are distressed stifle the immune system, but good 
stress or what is known as eustress (pronounced U-stress ) can work in our 
favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Eustress can come from the exhilaration we feel after exercise, when we 
experience good anticipation or from laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent study, we found that blood samples from medical students watching 
humorous videos showed measurable physiological changes in endorphins, which 
act as the body's own painkiller. These hormonal changes can aid in overcoming 
classical stress. By making yourself feel good, physiology is affected by 
psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients recovering from surgeries should find something each day to look 
forward too. Try to keep your spirits light and relate to people you enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Diversions such as humorous books, funny movies, enjoyable music or other 
entertaining activities will aid your recovery. How to Be a Great Visitor 
</P>
<P>
 It's nice to show how much you care, but visiting a patient at the hospital or 
at home comes with some guidelines too. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Mignano, registered nurse and manager of the Medical-ICU Coronary Care 
Unit at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, offers these suggestions for 
visitors:  
</P>
<P>
 * Find out the hospital's policies for the unit you're visiting. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't overstay. Twenty minutes is long enough to give your best wishes 
unless the patient asks you to stay longer. Remember they are there to recover, 
not to entertain. 
</P>
<P>
 * Unless you are asked to stay and help, leave the room when medical personnel 
are there to work with the patient. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask about the patient's restrictions before bringing flowers or food to the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't use the in-room telephone or bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wash your hands before and after your visit, and observe all rules regarding 
contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients usually feel better once they are home, but visitors should remember 
that they are still recuperating, says Elo Tanielian, director of Home Health 
and Hospice for St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank. She offers this advice 
for home visits: 
</P>
<P>
 * Schedule your visit -- don't just pop in. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep your visit upbeat and short. Focus on how well the patient is doing, 
not how far they have to go. 
</P>
<P>
 * Let the patient direct the conversation. Be a good listener. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't play the "I can top your symptoms" game or concentrate on your own 
troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask if you can bring a meal or special food you can share together. Take 
care of the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 * Anticipate needs. Ask if you can bring in the mail, pick up grocery items, 
run an errand or help the patient accomplish a task at the home.

RSVP / ORANGE COUNTY; OUT OF SITE, IN MIND; ALZHEIMER'S ASSN. PLAYS A NEW TUNE 
AT ANNUAL BENEFIT WITH A JAZZY, SOUTHERN-STYLED EVENT TO REMEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jazz music, Southern-style food and a Tara-like mansion gave a new beat to the 
Alzheimer's Assn. of Orange County's annual musical benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 "An Evening to Remember . . . All That Jazz" was the theme of the midsummer 
night's gala, which attracted about 300 guests Saturday to the Santa Ana 
Heights estate of John and Donna Crean. The $65-per-person event was expected 
to net $40,000 for the association, which supports Alzheimer's research and 
provides patient and care-giver services. 
</P>
<P>
 A Different Drummer 
</P>
<P>
 For the past three years the association's fund-raiser featured a performance 
by Pacific Symphony Orchestra at Irvine Meadows. This year the organizers 
decided to change their tune. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted something different. I happen to like jazz, and we were lucky 
enough to be chosen by the Creans to use their home -- it fits the theme really 
well," said Cathy Boyle, who served as gala co-chairwoman with Rosemary Carty. 
</P>
<P>
 After a cocktail reception and silent auction, guests sat by the pool at 
tables draped in yellow and decorated with baskets filled with rosemary -- the 
symbol for memory used by the Alzheimer's Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 They visited a buffet loaded with Southern specialties prepared by Regency 
Caterers of the Hyatt Newporter. The fare included Cajun sausage, beer-battered 
chicken, steak gumbo and Creole specialties. Aubergine, a Newport Beach 
restaurant, provided pecan whiskey tarts, crepes Suzette and assorted pastries. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests later danced to Dixieland, blues and big-band jazz performed by Big 
Band 2000, a group of 17 musicians led by Bill Strout. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosemary for Remembrance 
</P>
<P>
 Alzheimer's is a progressive, degenerative disease that attacks the brain, 
causing impaired memory, thinking and behavior. It afflicts 40,000 people in 
Orange County. Most guests got involved in the association because they know a 
family member or friend who had the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Coffman, board president, joined after his mother-in-law died of 
Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was 48 when the disease was diagnosed and died at age 59. We went through 
the whole process and felt we could offer what we learned to help others," said 
Coffman, who attended with wife Debbi. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the disease leaves its victims incapable of caring for themselves, it 
takes its toll not only on the patient but on family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's stressful. You're guilt-ridden when you lose your patience" with them, 
said Boyle, whose father-in-law died of Alzheimer's in 1990. "Sometimes you 
feel resentful. It's 24 hours, seven days a week, and you want time for 
yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 The disease is also financially devastating to families. Cost of providing 
custodial care can run $2,000 to $3,000 a month, and that is not covered by 
Medicare, said Linda Scheck, associate director of the association. Patients 
can live two to 20 years from the time the disease is diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County association, one of 220 nationwide, is based in Orange and 
provides a volunteer help line, free support groups for both patients and 
families and visiting volunteers to come to the home to relieve the care giver 
and work with the patient. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those attending the gala were: Carole Radzins, executive director of the 
association; Coleen Aldrich, Fay Blix, Richard Hamill, Hal Harley, Harold 
Hurwitz, Selly Jenny, Joyce Lowder, Meredith Medanich, Donald Power, Robert and 
Ute Rosenberg, Eric and Patricia Rosenberg, Mitchell and Joan Samuelson, Jim 
and Susan Vocke and Joyce Weiss. KATHRYN BOLD

A QUESTION OF THE RIGHT TO DIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE KNOWLTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The right to die has long been discussed by those stricken by cancer or other 
terminal illnesses, but it is the AIDS community -- particularly its gay 
contingent -- that has been the most organized and supportive, watchers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "This group is light-years ahead of any other group in terms of empowering 
themselves," says John Pridonoff, executive director of the Hemlock Society 
U.S.A., a euthanasia advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
 "The educational level and history of activism in the tightly knit gay 
community has led to a very assertive movement." 
</P>
<P>
 Gay men with AIDS have a harder time staying in denial than other patients do, 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "While cancer strikes individual families, AIDS has gutted an entire society," 
he says. "Cancer patients haven't watched 30 friends die gruesome deaths with 
no time to grieve in between. They're demanding more of everything -- 
medically, spiritually, socially and politically -- because they realize 
there's nothing left to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 The suicides go on mostly in large cities, Pridonoff says, because that's 
where most of the resources and support for it are. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that it's against the law doesn't mean anything to people dying," he 
says. "And those assisting are so proficient at it now that the coroner's 
office doesn't even get, or want to get, involved. As long as it's not a 
blatant suicide, they let it go by." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Jamison, formerly a Hemlock regional director who now runs life and 
death workshops in San Francisco, estimates that one in four AIDS deaths are 
assisted suicides. He says many are "managed deaths" brought about by doctors 
giving deliberate morphine overdoses, ostensibly for the control of pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's out there and it's epidemic but no one wants to face what's going on," 
he says. "I'm not a hard-core advocate of the right to die. But I do want to 
help them make the best decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Jamison says the most important part of the right-to-die movement needs to be 
cautious education. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are involving family and friends and they're way over their heads," he 
says. "I want to see physicians and therapists involved. Instead of keeping it 
closeted, let's move it out and say, how do we involve families, significant 
others, friends, nurses and hospices in the process of helping patients make 
the right decision?" LESLIE KNOWLTON

14 CAR DEALERS CLAIM MISSING COUPLE TOOK THEM FOR A RIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Call it the battle of the Toyota dealerships. Or car wars. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly three years after car brokers Dan and Mayumi Nishikawa bought 
first-class flights to Japan for themselves, their children and their cat, 16 
auto dealerships across Southern California are winding up a messy civil 
lawsuit. The suit alleges that the couple wrote $1.8 million in rubber checks 
in 1991 so they could, in effect, defraud 14 of the dealerships out of 129 
pricey automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for all the car dealers say the Nishikawas, who have not been located, 
contended that they and their Torrance-based PIAA Inc. car brokerage were 
"ethnic brokers," who bought new cars and sold them to Asian and Asian American 
buyers wary of non-Asian car salespeople. 
</P>
<P>
 But lawyers for the 14 dealerships -- 13 Toyota franchises and Lexus of Santa 
Monica -- allege that the Nishikawas actually pulled off a "Ponzi-like scheme" 
on them by gaining their trust over several years and then writing bad checks 
on one huge, final purchase of cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The dealers allege in a suit in Los Angeles Superior Court that the Nishikawas 
were aided by a lack of caution at Toyota of North Hollywood and 
Koreatown-based Han Kook Motors Inc. The lawsuit by the 14 dealerships against 
the two firms alleges that the Nishikawas resold many of the autos they bought 
to those two dealerships, at prices so low the dealerships' executives should 
have been suspicious of the sales. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday, a state appellate court panel generally agreed with that 
assessment. The three-judge panel, with little comment, upheld a 1993 Superior 
Court ruling in favor of the 14 dealerships. The panel's decision means that 
whatever happened to the money -- and to the Nishikawas -- the lower court 
order stands, requiring Toyota of North Hollywood and Han Kook Motors to pay 
about $1.8 million to the dealerships for the cars, plus court costs and 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the basic principle of robbing Peter to pay Paul until the whole thing 
collapses," said Norris Bishton, a lawyer who represents the 14 dealers and 
owns one of them, Toyota of Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Court testimony by a PIAA employee described the Nishikawas as doing very well 
for themselves -- trading up from a small rented South Bay apartment to several 
posh houses. They had a lavish lifestyle, complete with shopping trips to Rodeo 
Drive for $5,000 suits and a white limousine to ferry their children to school, 
according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Just about everything else in the case remains hotly contested, including 
whether the Nishikawas spent the money on their affluent lifestyle as they went 
along, lost it in bad business deals or absconded with the loot at the end when 
the alleged scheme collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Toyota Motor Sales USA, which oversees all Toyota franchise dealerships in 
this country, declined to comment. "They tried to stay out of it -- legally 
they stayed out of it -- but they are in the middle of it" because they must 
deal with parties on both sides, one lawyer involved said of Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
 One Toyota executive, who asked not to be identified, agreed, saying the 
parent corporation has taken great pains to stay neutral. "It would be between 
the dealers," said John Matt, vice president of sales for Toyota Motor Sales 
USA. "Certainly there was a dispute and a conflict between the dealers 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
 According to testimony and court documents, the Nishikawas were middlemen of 
sorts who over several years bought thousands of brand new Toyotas and Lexuses 
at dealers from Carlsbad to Thousand Oaks to San Bernardino, and then sold them 
at cost, or a loss, to Han Kook or the North Hollywood dealership, while 
keeping some of the proceeds for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 But all that, lawyers for the 14 dealerships allege in court documents, was 
part of an even larger setup to gain the trust of dealership executives before 
defrauding them in a big final score. In October, 1991, the Nishikawas bought 
179 new cars for about $2.6 million, sold most of them to Toyota of North 
Hollywood and Han Kook Motors and then left the country before anyone realized 
that funds did not exist to pay for the cars, lawyers allege in court 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Toyota of North Hollywood and Han Kook Motors "should have been more 
suspicious that something was wrong," because the Nishikawas continued selling 
them cars for less than the Toyota factory's wholesale price, Bishton said. 
"They knew (something was wrong), but they chose to look the other way. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like someone was saying to them, 'We'll sell you $100 bills for $90 
apiece,' " Bishton said. "The court found they . . . chose to look the other 
way while continuing to buy the cars in bad faith." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Nishikawas, Bishton said he tried to get authorities to extradite 
them to the United States to face criminal prosecution. "I could never interest 
law enforcement in looking for them," he said. "It has been very frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti and an official 
with the state Department of Motor Vehicles said they were unaware of any 
criminal investigations into the Nishikawas or the car deals. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer for Toyota of North Hollywood and Han Kook Motors sees things 
differently. J. Douglas Post contends that his two clients did nothing wrong 
and that at least some of the other 14 dealers were improperly benefiting from 
the bulk sale of the cars to PIAA, falsely reporting them in such a way as to 
rack up lucrative incentive benefits from the factory. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishton denied any wrongdoing on the part of his clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Post said, the court failed to uphold most of the arguments by lawyers 
for the 14 plaintiff dealerships, including their allegation that the 
Nishikawas and the two dealerships had engaged in a conspiracy or unfair 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Post said the 14 dealerships prevailed only on a so-called "conversion claim" 
against Toyota of North Hollywood and Han Kook Motors, in which they claimed 
continuing ownership rights to the cars because they were never paid for by 
PIAA, which stands for Pacific Imported Automobiles of America. The two 
dealerships, however, claimed that the original 14 dealers lost their ownership 
rights when they sold the vehicles to PIAA on credit, and not for cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Where the cars involved are now is unclear. Lawyers said they probably were 
resold by the two dealerships long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Post said the 14 dealers sought $15 million in their original suit, and that 
figure was whittled down to an ultimate judgment of less than $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Nishikawas, Post said: "They lost the money. They didn't go back to 
Japan with a $2-million pot of money. There may have been shopping trips to 
Rodeo Drive and whatnot." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Nishikawas lost money on the cars they did not get paid for.  
</P>
<P>
 Post maintained that his clients' only failing was an innocent one. "The 
judges found that we should have known that these plaintiffs retained some 
ownership rights to the cars they sold to PIAA by virtue of the fact that they 
didn't end up getting paid," he said. "There was no way for us to know that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nishikawas were selling the cars at a loss to build up a relationship with 
the dealers on both sides, and they ultimately wanted to recoup their losses by 
opening a retail facility in Torrance to sell cars to the public, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if we'll ever know exactly why they did it," another attorney 
for the 14 dealerships, Thomas S. Nessinger, said of the Nishikawas. " . . . 
They purchased plane tickets for themselves, their children and their cat in 
1991 just when the whole thing was crashing, and just kind of left some 
American employees to sit there and face this mob."

SKID ROW AREA TO GET TOILETS FOR HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two dozen portable toilets will be installed around Los Angeles' Skid Row as 
early as next week, but the pattern of the potty installations will make more 
sense to political insiders than to the homeless men and women who are supposed 
to use them. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a compromise approved Monday by the city Board of Public Works, the 
long-sought public toilets will be placed on sidewalks around the 9th City 
Council District, where Councilwoman Rita Walters supports the program, but not 
in the 14th District, where Councilman Richard Alatorre opposes it. 
</P>
<P>
 The action makes the bulk of Downtown eligible for the $53,000 six-month trial 
program, except for an Alatorre-represented swath that thrusts into the heart 
of Downtown from roughly 7th Street south to Olympic Boulevard and from Hill 
Street east into Alatorre's Eastside district. 
</P>
<P>
 To Alatorre and his staff, the exclusion of the sidewalk toilets is a 
reasonable response to complaints from business people, who say the 
unsupervised privies will make their troubled neighborhood even less desirable. 
But Walters and her aides called the compromise "absurd," saying the toilets 
should improve public health, along with the look and smell, of all of 
downtrodden Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's vote by the Board of Public Works culminates a struggle that began in 
1992 when a nonprofit agency, Las Familias del Pueblo, tried to place toilets 
on sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then-Mayor Tom Bradley blocked that move and instead opted for a program to 
keep a few permanent toilets in nonprofit offices open 24 hours a day. But 
homeless advocates say the problem of public urination and defecation has 
continued, and Alice Callaghan of Las Familias del Pueblo has continued to push 
for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates who felt the toilet problem was not hitting bureaucrats close enough 
to home staged a four-hour blockade of a City Hall men's room in May. The 
protest succeeded in getting Mayor Richard Riordan's office and others to focus 
on the public toilet question. 
</P>
<P>
 The final details approved Monday allow business owners adjacent to the 
toilets to lodge protests about designated locations. The Board of Public Works 
will hear such appeals and decide whether to install the toilets. 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise prohibits toilets on public property in Alatorre's district, 
but allows as many as three of the outhouses on private lots where owners gave 
consent. 
</P>
<P>
 "To put the toilets on the sidewalks without supervision would maximize the 
danger to the homeless and to the adjoining business people," said Bonnie Sue 
Brody, an Alatorre aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Brody also told the Board of Public Works that Skid Row business owners 
already struggle with administrative regulations and should not be forced to 
attend public hearings in an effort to remove the toilets. 
</P>
<P>
 Alatorre "doesn't want them to have these near their properties and to be an 
attraction for the kinds of crimes and other problems we have already seen in 
that part of the 14th District," Brody said. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Woo, president of a business group called the Central City East Assn., 
said hearings to remove unwanted toilets would "create an undo hardship on 
business people" and are not in keeping with Riordan's pro-business agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Some representatives of agencies providing service to the homeless also 
opposed the program. Mike Neely, director of the Homeless Outreach Program, 
said the toilets could become hiding places for "predators who want to prey on 
our more fragile population." He argued for more permanent facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Callaghan said that most social services agencies and many businesses are 
ready to try the portable outhouses, which are similar to those used at 
construction sites. "It may be a disaster, but this is a pilot project and we 
at least have to try something," she said. "No one has come up with anything 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the loss of Alatorre's district does only partial damage to the 
program. Five toilets that had been planned for the 14th District will be moved 
across San Pedro and 5th streets and into the 9th District. With three more 
toilets going on private property in the 14th, the net loss will be about half 
a dozen toilets, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Walters still was vexed by the political distribution of the privies, 
which she hadn't been advised of in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard people suggest that more people will come because of the toilets," 
Walters said. "Well, the streets are already full of homeless people. People 
say drug dealing and prostitution will come, but there is already horrendous 
drug dealing and prostitution on the Row." 
</P>
<P>
 What will change, Walters said, is that "streets and alleys will be cleaner 
and people will have a place to go to the toilet."

A DRAINED CUP; SOCCER CROWDS DWINDLE AND PASADENA BEGINS RETURNING TO NORMAL 
AFTER WORLD-CLASS PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Tony Vazquez figured it was his last chance to get in on a piece of the 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 He missed all eight of the World Cup games at the Rose Bowl, despite his best 
efforts to get tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 So there he was on Monday, spending his afternoon chatting with tourists and 
searching for bargains on hats and T-shirts at the tournament's giant sale in a 
parking lot outside the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here for the remnants," said Vazquez, an El Monte man who has been glued 
to his television since the tournament started a month ago. "I just wanted to 
see what of the World Cup was left." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the crowds were gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Andres Cantor, the man who became famous nationally for announcing " 
Gooooooool! " was finally starting to lose his voice. 
</P>
<P>
 And the city that had spent two years getting ready for the tournament cleaned 
up the trash and started to take down its colorful decorations. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet outside the Rose Bowl and along Colorado Boulevard in Old Pasadena, a few 
thousand of the most devout fans gathered for last-minute bargains and a few 
snapshots. Coming down from the world-class party wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry it's over," said Greg Stavish, 42, a Pasadena man who watched the 
games on TV. "We witnessed a melting pot of cultures. It was uplifting that 
people from all over the world got along so well." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, police reported few problems during the celebration that followed 
Brazil's victory over Italy on Sunday in the World Cup final at the Rose Bowl 
-- an event watched by perhaps 2 billion people around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By some estimates, between 15,000 and 20,000 people were crammed into the 
streets of Old Pasadena for Sunday's festivities. 
</P>
<P>
 But only 63 people, relatively few for the size of the event, were arrested 
during the postgame celebration -- 55 for public drunkenness, five for 
disturbing the peace, one for battery, one for throwing a flammable device and 
one for reckless driving. Another 32 people were arrested at the Rose Bowl for 
violations ranging from robbery to scalping. 
</P>
<P>
 "From our standpoint, we were very pleased," said Pasadena Police Cmdr. Mary 
Schander. "We were really able to deliver a secure environment." 
</P>
<P>
 However, she added: "The Brazilian fans do know how to party. The first 
reveler arrived at around 9 a.m. and the last one didn't leave till after 2 
a.m." 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado Boulevard merchants were amazed by the numbers of hungry and thirsty 
partyers who turned up on their doorsteps. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday morning, many business owners were struggling to restock everything 
from cigarettes to cans of Coke. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just overwhelmed," said Tom Rosenstein, owner of the Pasadena 
Creamery yogurt shop. "I have never seen anything like it. It was similar to 
the Rose Parade, but it was people who all wanted to spend money. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we could have one day like that every month, it would be fabulous." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Cantor, the Spanish-language radio announcer, was ready for a 
much-needed rest. 
</P>
<P>
 The 31-year-old Argentine, who attended high school and college in Los 
Angeles, said he learned Monday that he might need surgery for a herniated disc 
-- compounding his post-World Cup blues. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day after is always sort of a letdown physically," said Cantor, his voice 
hoarse after calling all 52 games over the last month. In addition to 
interviewing players and coaches, he became the subject of dozens of 
interviews, including an appearance on the "David Letterman Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the back pain, he said, "I made it through." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the World Cup, it "showed the world that the U.S. can stage an 
important event like this. It had record attendance, which speaks for itself." 
</P>
<P>
 For those who still couldn't get enough of soccer, the Disney International 
Youth Soccer Cup, for players ages 10 to 19, began Monday night with opening 
ceremonies along Holly Street in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament, which will last six days, will be held on various fields in 
Pasadena, with the final games being played at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard Plotkin, a Pasadena lawyer who stopped by the Rose Bowl parking lot 
Monday afternoon to stock up on half-price shirts, has been coaching a team of 
girls from Arcadia preparing for the Disney cup. 
</P>
<P>
 He joked: "The little cup is over and now the big cup is about to start." 
</P>

SINGER JAMES LOSES HIS BID TO AVOID PRISON; COURTS: BLOCKED FROM RE-ENTERING 
DRUG REHABILITATION, HE IS ORDERED TO BEGIN A FIVE-YEAR TERM IN ASSAULTS ON TWO 
WOMEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Singer Rick James, famous for his 1981 hit "Superfreak," was ordered to begin 
serving five years and four months in state prison Monday after a Van Nuys 
Superior Court judge refused his last-ditch appeal to re-enter a drug 
rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Judge Michael R. Hoff told the Grammy Award-winning singer that he 
was lucky he was not headed to prison for a dozen years, perhaps even for life, 
in connection with two violent attacks against women. The judge called the 
shorter sentence "a gift." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, court records released for the first time reveal James' tales of a 
troubled childhood and the depths of an addiction that consumed half his life 
and made him a virtual recluse. 
</P>
<P>
 James, 46, was convicted last year in connection with assaults on two women at 
his home and at the St. James Club & Hotel in West Hollywood, and could have 
faced nine to 12 years in prison on those counts, Deputy Dist. Atty. Andrew 
Flier said. The jury was hung on a torture charge that carries a life prison 
sentence.  
</P>
<P>
 But before prosecutors could retry James on that count, allegations surfaced 
that a district attorney's investigator had furnished drugs to a jailed witness 
who testified against James. The investigator was not directly involved in the 
James case, Flier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Hoff told James on Monday that "you can thank the D.A.'s investigator 
for your continued luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the alleged misconduct is being investigated by the state attorney 
general and the investigator no longer works for the district attorney's 
office, a source close to the case said.  
</P>
<P>
 Because of the scandal and the internal probe, James was allowed to plead no 
contest to assault charges involving the attack at his home. Prosecutors said 
James and his girlfriend, model Tanya Anne Hijazi, imprisoned and tortured a 
woman during a weeklong cocaine binge at his gated house in the Hollywood 
Hills. Hijazi, who pleaded guilty to an assault charge and eventually testified 
against James, is serving two years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the arrangement, James received a shorter sentence and 
prosecutors said they would not oppose his entry into the drug program instead 
of prison. 
</P>
<P>
 James originally entered the Civil Addict Program at the state Corrections 
Rehabilitation Center in Norco in February and by all accounts was doing well. 
</P>
<P>
 But Warden Jean E. Anderson decided in May that he did not qualify because his 
crimes involved acts of violence.  
</P>
<P>
 "The law is clear," said Richard R. Clouse, an attorney for the state 
Department of Corrections. He said the department is given "a great deal of 
discretion as to whether any particular person is entitled to the Civil Addict 
Program. The fact that Mr. James is a famous person and a celebrity makes no 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Mark Werksman said James was considering possible appeals. He 
contended that prison officials had been prejudiced against James because of 
his fame and "Superfreak" image. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 15 years, he has been known as the Superfreak," Werksman said. "They 
rejected the Superfreak. They never bothered to learn about the real Rick 
James." 
</P>
<P>
 James' real name is James Johnson. He was born in Buffalo, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Evaluations recently made public in James' court file offer new glimpses into 
the singer's background, and the depth of his drug addiction. They are based 
largely on psychologists' interviews with James.  
</P>
<P>
 The reports described James as an abused child who first experimented with 
drugs at 14 and spent half his adult life as an addict. By 1991, he was holed 
up full time in his bedroom, taking as many as nine Halcion sleeping tablets a 
night and spending up to $1,000 a day on cocaine, according to the reports. 
</P>
<P>
 James, the third of eight children, described his father, James Johnson Sr., 
as an abusive alcoholic who left when he was 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rick observed that his father was 'very sadistic' with his mother and beat 
her often," criminologist Sheila Balkan wrote in her Dec. 23 evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 After his father left, James' devoutly religious mother, Betty Gladden, worked 
two jobs -- as a maid "and in the numbers rackets," which James said made him 
ashamed, according to the reports. She also beat the children after her husband 
left, the reports said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For Rick, his mother was the main abuser. He relates that she was often 
uncontrollable, and that she administered beatings with a knotted electrical 
cord for little or no reason, 'letting out her frustrations on us kids.' " 
</P>
<P>
 His relationship with his mother improved as he grew older, and she was 
supportive of his musical career. Later, he said, she became his "best friend." 
</P>
<P>
 James said he started using drugs, including marijuana and heroin, in his 
mid-teens. His career in music exposed him to more drugs, which he consumed in 
increasingly large amounts after his first album in 1977 made him an overnight 
success.  
</P>
<P>
 "With my first check, I bought all the drugs I could afford," he told Balkan. 
He started freebasing cocaine in 1981, the same year "Superfreak" started its 
climb up the charts.  
</P>
<P>
 By the late 1980s, he said, he was spiraling downward. He was involved in a 
lawsuit with Motown and did not write or record for four years. In fact, he 
said, he did not leave his bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 When his suit with Motown was settled in 1990, James returned to the studio, 
but took the next two years to produce his next album. His mother was found to 
have cancer in 1990 and died the following year.  
</P>
<P>
 James was convicted of restraining and burning a young woman with a hot pipe 
during a weeklong cocaine binge in July, 1991, at his house. 
</P>
<P>
 He was free on bail when the second assault occurred in November, 1992, in 
James' room on the 11th floor of the St. James Club. 
</P>
<P>
 The experts who evaluated James agreed that he probably would not have hurt 
the women except for the influence of cocaine, and that he would have benefited 
from the state's drug program.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: POMONA; MAN SHOT WHILE 
WATCHING WORLD CUP FINAL ON TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 43-year-old Pomona man remained in critical condition Monday after being 
shot in the face during a home robbery while he watched the World Cup soccer 
final on television Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 Police said three suspects were arrested and are believed to be members of an 
Asian gang.Officers said the victim, whose name was not released, also is 
Asian, as are the people who were with him at the house in the 1000 block of 
South Waters Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Several men, women and children were watching the game when the robbers 
entered the home, said Pomona Police Lt. Rick Mackey.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the people in the house retrieved a shotgun and in a tussle it 
discharged, hitting suspect Rathana Phung, 19, of Santa Ana, police said. One 
of the other suspects allegedly shot the 43-year-old man in the face at 
point-blank range with a handgun. Police said they were investigating who shot 
the man. 
</P>
<P>
 Suspects Map Eam, 20, of Long Beach, and a 16-year-old boy from Downey took 
Phung to Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center, where they were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 All three were booked on suspicion of attempted murder.  
</P>
<P>
 Police were uncertain whether the suspects knew the victims and were 
investigating whether rival gang members were in the house during the attack.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: POMONA; TESTING ORDERED 
FOR KILLER OF WITNESS IN MURDER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge ruled Monday that a gang member who killed a teen-ager to keep him 
from testifying in the murder trial of a "home boy" must undergo 90 days of 
evaluation before he is sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Ignacio Contreras was a juvenile when he killed 14-year-old Eduardo 
Samaniego on Aug. 17, 1992. Superior Court Judge George Trammell was required 
by law to send Contreras, now 19, to the California Youth Authority for the 
diagnostic evaluation. Contreras, due for sentencing Oct. 14, entered a 
negotiated plea to a second-degree murder charge after Samaniego's parents 
refused to allow their daughter to testify. Contreras is expected to get 20 
years to life. The defendant in the first case was convicted.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: DOWNEY; PSYCHIATRIST 
RECOMMENDS NO PAROLE FOR MOLESTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A psychiatrist has recommended that convicted child molester Joe Caro Jr., who 
was due for parole last Saturday, be sent back to prison for another year. 
</P>
<P>
 Caro's record of sex crimes against children dates to 1952. His scheduled 
release caused an uproar last week in Downey, where the state Department of 
Corrections had arranged for the 74-year-old man to move into a motel next door 
to a preschool playground. 
</P>
<P>
 Parole officials reconsidered Caro's placement after receiving hundreds of 
phone calls. A hearing on his parole has been set for next month, when his 
psychiatric evaluation will be reviewed.

ACLU, PASADENA COUNCILMAN DROP SUIT AGAINST CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The American Civil Liberties Union and Pasadena City Councilman Isaac Richard 
dropped a lawsuit against the city Monday over its code of conduct for council 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 An ACLU lawyer said that because the city changed its ordinance in June to 
specify conduct and not speech, it no longer violates the 1st Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is, this goofy law has been effectively repealed and replaced as a 
consequence of this lawsuit by a new law that singles out only conduct for 
sanction," Mark D. Rosenbaum, legal director of ACLU of Southern California, 
said Monday. He said the ACLU had also been informed there would be further 
revisions to tie the law even closer to conduct rather than speech. 
</P>
<P>
 The original September, 1992, ordinance allowed the council to levy sanctions 
against council members who do not "perform responsibilities in a manner that 
is efficient, courteous, responsive and impartial" toward council members, 
staff and the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU filed the suit in May on behalf of Richard and two of his 
constituents after Richard was denied a council perquisite -- access to 75 
World Cup tickets -- as part of the sanctions for allegedly acting abusively 
toward city staff in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 ACLU attorneys had declared the code, prompted in part by Richard's heated 
arguments with other council members, as possibly the most restrictive of its 
kind in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard was censured in August, 1992, after city Housing Administrator Phyllis 
Mueller filed a sexual harassment complaint against him for cursing and 
threatening her during a council meeting. In June, 1993, he was censured for 
cursing a roomful of city officials, including City Clerk Maria Stewart, who 
also filed a sexual harassment complaint. In October, 1993, a Superior Court 
judge ordered Richard to keep his distance from Councilman Chris Holden for 
three years. In a court petition, Holden said Richard tried to provoke a fight 
in the Rose Bowl press box. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, a judge is to decide whether to issue an order to keep Richard away 
from a city Department of Water and Power supervisor he allegedly harassed.

WACHS SEEKS TO ABOLISH LIMIT ON L.A.'S FUNDING OF PLAQUES FOR SLAIN OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Councilman Joel Wachs on Monday proposed elimination of spending 
restrictions on memorial plaques for police officers killed in the line of 
duty, saying the city was "nickel and diming" the dead officers' families and 
friends into paying for them. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, which Wachs called "an embarrassment to the city," provides money 
only to mount the officer's badge on a plaque, which is given to the family at 
the officer's funeral as a memento. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow officers and family members must chip in to have the officer's gun, 
medals, pins, whistles and other personal items included on the memorial. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachs said the city should pay to include the additional items. 
</P>
<P>
 "The very least the city can do is honor their memory with a suitable memorial 
at their funeral," he said at a news conference in front of the memorial 
fountain at Parker Center, the Los Angeles Police Department's headquarters. He 
was joined by Deputy Chief Bernard Parks and other police officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachs' attention was drawn to the law by police officials who were outraged 
when they learned they had to pay to include more than a badge on a framed 
plaque for Christy Hamilton, a rookie officer killed while responding Feb. 22 
to a domestic dispute call . 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed rather ludicrous that they would ask that (families) do that," said 
Officer Angela Hougen, who works in the unit that provides counseling and other 
services to slain officers' families. 
</P>
<P>
 Hougen said that as she arranged for Hamilton's memorial plaque and funeral, 
she found that many officers were so financially strapped by home damage in the 
Jan. 17 earthquake that they had little to donate for a plaque. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachs also complained that the city is charging the families of slain officers 
$710 to buy and render unusable an officer's semiautomatic pistol so it can be 
mounted on a plaque. A similar handgun could be purchased for less than $400 
new, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To demonstrate their point, Wachs and Hougen displayed Hamilton's framed badge 
next to a larger framed memorial to a retired traffic officer that included his 
whistle, handcuffs, medals, stripes, pins and uniform patches. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachs said his proposal, which he plans to introduce in the City Council 
meeting today, would lift the spending limit to cover the cost of including 
additional personal items, which Wachs estimated would not amount to more than 
about $500 for each memorial.

FACES OF THE FREE; PHOTOGRAPHER RESCUES 150,000 IMAGES FROM QUAKE-DAMAGED STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a six-month standoff, Joel Greenberg freed the hostages on Monday. All 
150,000 of them. Risking possible contact with asbestos, not to mention 
possible arrest, Greenberg pulled a rental truck up to his photography studio 
at Laurel Plaza mall in North Hollywood and retrieved the thousands of 
portraits, photos and negative images of loved ones held captive inside his 
shop since the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like opening up a tomb," the owner of Real Faces Photography said as he 
pulled out old family and baby pictures sent to him for restoration before the 
quake. "These are family heirlooms. A lot of people's lives are disrupted when 
they can't have their pictures." 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to get into the 26-year-old shopping center since a few days after the 
temblor, Greenberg and other merchants said that mall managers had threatened 
to call for the arrest of anyone who tried to get back in without signing a 
liability waiver. Such a waiver would limit merchants' ability to file future 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three merchants have been allowed to reopen in the shopping center since 
the quake, and the others may never be able to move back because the mall's 
management company, Forest City Enterprises Inc., is considering razing the old 
mall to make way for a new one. 
</P>
<P>
 But Greenberg wasn't arrested Monday, benefiting some of his clients, who had 
been waiting since the temblor to see the immortalized faces of their families. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps no one had waited as patiently as Los Angeles resident Monina Ingco, 
whose portrait of herself, her sister and her mother was to have been a belated 
1993 family Christmas gift. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is great news," Ingco, 30, said. "We've been waiting for such a long 
time. It's like you are the one who is trapped inside the shop." 
</P>
<P>
 Elegant Valentine's Day portraits of ladies in evening wear, high school 
senior shots and wedding photos were among the other buried memories sealed in 
Greenberg's studio. Even the cash register contained $30 left over from the day 
before the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 The emptying of Greenberg's shop raised questions about other merchants' 
ability to retrieve their belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 As late as last week, mall managers had cited asbestos hazards as a key reason 
for their policy preventing merchants from entering their stores. Greenberg has 
questioned that claim, saying that a copy of mall management's own asbestos 
report shows only minimal risks at a handful of the mall's 33 stores. 
</P>
<P>
 As he pointed to the ceiling tiles in his store, where mall officials told him 
asbestos contamination took place, Greenberg said: "None of them have been 
removed. They tested, but they didn't find any. Why wasn't I let in sooner?" 
</P>
<P>
 That same question was on the mind of Stan Levy, owner of the center's George 
Allen Shoes store. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have done me good if I could have gotten my inventory out in March 
and April," Levy said. "My inventory is worthless now. In the fashion industry, 
it'slike last year's chopped liver. And last year's chopped liver is not very 
good." 
</P>
<P>
 But Levy said he was not sure that Greenberg's successful rescue operation was 
good news for mall tenants because it could mean that the mall might be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Leanse, an attorney for Cleveland-based mall owner F.C. Laurel Inc., said 
that Greenberg's action does not indicate impending doom for the mall and that 
he was not arrested because it would have been inappropriate. "As far as 
asbestos, we still think that there are risks," Leanse said.  
</P>
<P>
 He said he does not fear a run on the mall by other merchants, adding that he 
hopes most will wait for a final report on asbestos contamination, with a 
store-by-store breakdown, that he expects within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg is among those merchants who have accused mall managers of delaying 
earthquake repairs to keep the mall closed while they concentrate instead on 
gaining approval for a new $150-million mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Expected to go before the Los Angeles City Council by the end of the summer, 
the proposal would allow owners to raze the 26-year-old mall and replace it 
with a modern, three-level shopping center with three department stores and 
5,400 parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg and Levy said they will both adopt a wait-and-see attitude before 
deciding whether to reopen their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Greenberg is just happy to be back in business, even though he has 
to operate out of his Valley Village home and is living on his disaster 
insurance settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he will make no money completing his pre-quake work orders, and 
without a store he can hardly expect to attract much additional business. But 
at least he will have fulfilled his obligation to his customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best day I've had in six months," said Greenberg, cradling a box 
of negatives. "It will be a shadow of my former business, but at least I'll be 
in business."

SEPT. 13 ELECTION ORDERED TO FILL HILL'S SENATE SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has called a special election for Sept. 13 to replace former 
Sen. Frank Hill (R-Whittier), who stepped down from office after he was 
convicted of federal corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
 If no candidate wins a majority of votes cast, there will be a runoff in the 
Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill resigned his office July 8, three weeks after a federal jury found him 
guilty of extortion, money laundering and conspiracy -- charges that stemmed 
from his taking a $2,500 payment from an undercover FBI agent who was part of a 
sting operation. Hill remains free while awaiting sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's 29th Senate District, which includes a large slice of the San Gabriel 
Valley, is considered favorable for Republican candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Assembly Republicans, Paul Horcher of Diamond Bar and Richard Mountjoy of 
Arcadia, are considering running for the office.

ACCESS TO SEC ELECTRONIC RECORDS HAS BEEN DIFFICULT, EXPENSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB WELLS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Edgar, the vast government database on companies across America, is a treasure 
house of public records. But it's been criticized as relatively inaccessible 
and too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent experimental link of the Security and Exchange Commission's Edgar 
database to the popular Internet computer network provides an important new 
means for affordable public access. 
</P>
<P>
 Before this inexpensive computer link, people had to visit one of the SEC's 
public reference rooms in New York, Washington and Chicago to use the database. 
Or they would pay a considerable amount of money to private businesses who sell 
the government data to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 According to James Love, director of Taxpayer Assets Project and a persistent 
SEC critic, the problem is the SEC designed a distribution system that favors 
corporate clients instead of the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Vos, vice president of the financial printing company Bowne & Co. in 
New York, agreed that the distribution side of Edgar needs improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 John Lane, the SEC's chief information officer, defended the SEC's system as 
sound but admits Edgar distribution is in its infancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane said he "had expected to see more retail services at this point" based on 
the Edgar database but figures there haven't been enough companies listed on 
the database to inspire private industry to develop new products. 
</P>
<P>
 Edgar contains annual reports, proxy statements and other important 
information from one-fifth of the 15,000 companies that report to the SEC. All 
companies will come on line by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 While a document downloaded from the Internet site costs only a few dollars, a 
paper copy of the same document would cost more than $50 from a leading SEC 
data vendor, Disclosure Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Love, whose group is affiliated with consumer activist Ralph Nader, takes 
particular issue with the SEC's contract with Mead Data Central of Dayton, 
Ohio. Mead has a $72 million SEC contract to sell the Edgar information on a 
wholesale basis to other commercial vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 Love maintains that Mead has little incentive to provide inexpensive public 
access to the Edgar files, since the company already makes considerable money 
selling a separate stream of SEC data to corporations on its Nexis-Lexis 
database. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts say the SEC information is a small but valuable product for 
the Nexis-Lexis database, the backbone for Mead's electronic publishing 
business, which had 1993 sales of $551.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Mead spokeswoman Judi Schultz said Mead's market isn't the casual individual 
consumer, but intensive users of information such as law firms, large news 
organizations and investment banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Schultz also denied Love's charges that Mead has a conflict of interest since 
it has the wholesale Edgar contract and also sells SEC information on 
Nexis-Lexis. The SEC regulates and audits the wholesale prices Mead charges for 
the Edgar data. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason consumers may have been slow to gain affordable access to Edgar has 
been the upheaval in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Disclosure Inc., a leading SEC information vendor, last February acquired data 
vendor SEC Online of Hauppauge, N.Y., and in 1991 bought Bechtel Information 
Services Inc., the provider of paper and microfiche copies of SEC filings to 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
 But consumers may see more low-cost offerings of the SEC documents in the wake 
of the Internet link to Edgar, industry officials said. Both Disclosure and 
Mead say they're studying how to distribute SEC filings to individuals.

COMPANY'S SECRET INGREDIENT IS DIVERSIFICATION; LONGEVITY: BAKERY SUPPLY HOUSE 
GEORGE RUHL & SON HAS BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR 205 YEARS. IT HAS EXPANDED ITS 
PRODUCT LINE DRAMATICALLY IN THE PAST TWO DECADES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There's no big secret to keeping a family business going for 205 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It either evolves or dies, one of those two," said George R. Ruhl III, owner 
of the nation's oldest bakery supply house. 
</P>
<P>
 Started in 1789 by Conrad Ruhl as a flour and feed mill, the company is now 
known as George Ruhl & Son, and is the ninth-oldest company in the country, 
according to a survey by Forbes magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ruhl took over the business from his father in 1972, flour and sugar were 
the only things the company sold, mostly to mom-and-pop bakeries in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the younger Ruhl has ensured that the company evolved. He expanded 
its territory into four states and its product line from 30 items to more than 
2,000. Annual sales have grown from $250,000 in 1974 to the company's current 
$25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruhl's customers include universities, military bases and supermarkets as well 
as bakeries. The company now supplies them with everything from ingredients -- 
including more than two dozen types of flour, six kinds of butter, cake mixes, 
sprinkles and spices -- to finished products like frozen bagels and cookies. It 
also sells baking equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is unusual because it managed to avoid being consolidated into a 
larger firm and has continued to be run by family members, said Louis Galambos, 
a Johns Hopkins University professor who specializes in business history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Especially after 1900, very few families produced those kind of managerial 
resources consistently," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not many family-owned businesses survived the turn of the century without 
being taken over by a larger company, Galambos said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before 1890, giant corporations were the exception, and after 1904 they were 
the rule. There was a great wave of consolidation, a period of great prosperity 
and expansion of the stock market meant you could sell securities and bring 
about consolidations. 
</P>
<P>
 "And of course there was bitter competition and that led many people to give 
in to consolidation." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruhl, who is 49, said it took years for him to discover how unusual the 
company is. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't realize not many businesses survive past the first or second 
generation," he said. "A large percentage of my friends came from families that 
had a business. It didn't seem unusual to me." 
</P>
<P>
 The company has had to weather a few crises and undergo some changes to make 
it through the years and still be in business today. 
</P>
<P>
 It survived Baltimore's Great Fire in 1904, abandoned the feed business in 
1915 as cars replaced horses and began adding sugar and other baking supplies 
in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The health department would kill me now for doing this, but during the Great 
Fire our warehouse was on the waterfront in downtown Baltimore. As the fire 
approached, they threw all the flour, which came in barrels in those days, into 
the harbor," Ruhl said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The flour on the outside swelled and sealed the barrels. The next day they 
went out in a rowboat and scooped up the barrels," he said. "They scooped the 
flour out from the middle of the barrels where it wasn't wet, repackaged it, 
bought secondhand furniture and reopened." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the flour, the only thing that survived was a large safe, 
although the papers and coins inside burned or melted, Ruhl said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company remained on the waterfront in Baltimore until the 1970s, receiving 
flour on trains. Now it is run from a large warehouse just off Interstate 95 
outside the city. 
</P>
<P>
 With his recently awakened sense of history, Ruhl regrets throwing away some 
items over the years, including a ledger his grandfather used in the early 
1900s, and a stand-up accounting desk. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've moved five times since I've been here and you look back 30 years later 
and say, 'Why did I throw that away? It was 60 years old when I threw it out,' 
" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think every generation has treated it as its own business. The only thing 
that has remained the same is trying to treat the customer as friends and 
provide a good product at fair price," Ruhl said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Ruhl said he doesn't feel the weight of tradition on his shoulders and 
won't put pressure the next generation to keep the family business going. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't feel any pressure. My father didn't want me to go into it because he 
thought it was a dying business," Ruhl said. "I worked a year for Eastern 
Stainless Steel and he told me to stay there. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I saw more of a future running my own business. The reason my father 
didn't think there was any future back then was because the only thing sold was 
flour and sugar to bakeries in the city," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his three children wants to study business when he goes to college next 
year, and a daughter already works for the company, but whether they continue 
the business is up to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm like my father," Ruhl said. "One way or the other, it has to be their 
choice or they won't be happy with it."

MICROSOFT'S NEW FRONTIERS; OPPORTUNITY -- AND OBSTACLES -- ABOUND IN WAKE OF 
PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 While Saturday's settlement of a government antitrust case against Microsoft 
Corp. will do little to alter the balance of power in the mainstream PC 
software business, the competitive battles have only just begun in markets 
ranging from corporate computing to interactive television. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions of personal computer users see the bright-blue Windows logo every day 
when they boot up their PCs, but it is unclear how big an advantage that will 
be as Microsoft moves off the desktop and into the living room on the one hand 
and the climate-controlled corporate computer room on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "As what were separate businesses around consumer electronics and PCs come 
together in the intelligent communication area that is sometimes called the 
'superhighway,' we see competition intensifying," Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates 
said in a telephone news conference Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes in these new markets are high indeed. Just 33% of U.S. households 
have computers, after all, while more than 60% have cable television and 95% 
have telephones. Microsoft is spending more than $100 million a year in the 
hope of becoming a central player in multimedia, and many competitors fear it 
is only a matter of time before it monopolizes these emerging markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, investors Monday signaled confidence in Microsoft's future. With the 
cloud of the antitrust investigation lifted, Microsoft's shares rose $1.875 to 
$50.50 in heavy Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft is confident it can take advantage of its strength in the PC world 
to gain ground in new consumer and corporate markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Technically these are very, very, very, very closely tied," said Steve 
Ballmer, Microsoft's No. 2 man. "People who don't take an approach to leverage 
their technology will have a hard time succeeding." 
</P>
<P>
 Ballmer said the research Microsoft is undertaking in areas such as television 
set-top boxes and servers for interactive video is research the company would 
have to do anyway to deliver video to the desktop. 
</P>
<P>
 As for corporate networking, where Microsoft has been viewed as a laggard, 
Ballmer said the company has already turned the corner. "Soon it will become 
obvious how much progress we have made, and then everybody will be talking 
about the turnaround. I've never been more upbeat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is by no means assured that Microsoft will do as well in its new 
ventures as it has in its old. The company, in fact, faces many obstacles -- 
not the least of which is its own reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they bring to the table is that they probably know more about the widest 
variety of software than anyone in the world," said Denise Caruso, editor of 
the newsletter Technology & Media. "But there is a palpable distrust factor. 
They have to partner with all of these people who have been reading the 
business pages of the newspaper for the last 10 years -- so they have a big 
obstacle to overcome." 
</P>
<P>
 An alliance between Microsoft and the nation's two largest cable television 
operators that could have assured the company a key role in the world of 
interactive television reportedly broke down earlier this year over Microsoft's 
demands for large royalties. AT&T was also in discussions with the software 
giant, but it opted in the end to experiment with Microsoft competitors Novell 
and Lotus on a souped-up electronic-mail system for businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is always a problem when a high-tech company tries to switch from 
one technology to another. "A lot of this money could end up in a black hole," 
said George Smaby, head of a Minneapolis-based research group. But he said 
Microsoft has no choice but to pursue interactive television and multimedia. 
"They have a lot of 'Skunk Works' going, and one of them may prove to be the 
killer" application. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Microsoft has little choice but to continue its drive in mainstream 
corporate computing -- the traditional province of IBM -- where reliability and 
service are more important than price. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been an uphill battle for them to gain credibility in the corporate 
computing business," said Michael Goulde, consultant at Patricia Seybold Group, 
an industry research group. 
</P>
<P>
 But Goulde said Microsoft will emerge as a power in the long term by 
continuing to improve its products. He points out that it took five years for 
Windows to win acceptance. "If you can't beat them, change the rules" is the 
Microsoft credo, Goulde said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone needs to consider Microsoft a powerful competitor," said Jerry Held, 
senior vice president for interactive multimedia at Oracle Corp. The firm is 
Microsoft's key competitor in software for "video servers," which will sort and 
distribute digitized movies and other forms of information over the high-speed 
phone and cable lines of the information highway. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the scale of the problem is just so far removed from anything they've had 
experience in. Dealing with that size problem is something I believe is beyond 
the expertise of a company like Microsoft." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Microsoft retains some major advantages in attacking these new 
businesses -- not the least being the enormous profits that will continue to 
flow from its desktop computer business. The general consensus around the 
software industry Monday was that the settlement with the Justice Department -- 
under which Microsoft agreed to change the way it licenses DOS and Windows and 
free other software developers from restrictive non-disclosure agreements -- 
will do little to dent Microsoft's position in PCs. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft dominates in operating systems, which control the basic functions of 
the PC, and it is set to enhance that position with a new release of Windows, 
dubbed Chicago. More and more functions -- everything from networking to data 
compression -- are being integrated into the operating system and thus do not 
need to be purchased as separate programs. 
</P>
<P>
 And Microsoft has been steadily building its position in applications 
software, the computer programs that perform specific tasks. To the 
disappointment of many competitors, the Justice Department did nothing to 
undermine the advantage in developing application software that Microsoft gains 
by virtue of its control over the operating system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do get benefits from being a single company with a unified technology 
strategy," Gates said. "Our applications division developers have a close 
relationship with our operating systems division. We have never said we are 
trying to create some type of wall." 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft's chief competitors were circumspect in their responses to the 
settlement. Novell, which competes in operating systems, was delighted, but 
others were all but mute. 
</P>
<P>
 "The agreement between Microsoft and the Department of Justice has no impact 
on our business," said Philippe Kahn, chairman of Borland International and one 
of the most outspoken critics of Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have anything good to say, so we're not saying anything," said an 
executive at another Microsoft rival, who declined to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 A key battleground for the immediate future will be in applications aimed at 
consumers, especially the new breed of multimedia education and game programs 
that use CD-ROM technology. While the smaller multimedia firms say they have an 
advantage in creativity, Microsoft has the cash flow from other businesses to 
drive down prices -- and the clout with retailers to demand much-coveted shelf 
space for its multimedia titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlsbad, Calif.-based Compton's New Media, for example, has been engaged in a 
price war with Microsoft over the two firms' electronic encyclopedias. "We 
clash with them at the retail level all the time," said Compton's Executive 
Vice President Norman Bastin. "We tell them it's unfair, but the retailers are 
all scared of Microsoft." 
</P>
<P>
 Bastin hopes the settlement will force Microsoft to pay more attention to its 
core business and spend less money on getting a piece of his. "These other 
businesses have funded (Microsoft's) forays into multimedia," he said. "Now 
they're going to have to re-look at their main business and might take more 
care with them."

CRACKDOWN ON SNOOPING INTO TAX FILES TOLD; PRIVACY: SENATOR SAYS MORE THAN 
1,300 IRS EMPLOYEES WERE TARGETED. OFFENSES RANGED FROM NOSINESS TO BOGUS 
REFUNDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN BARR, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 1,300 employees of the Internal Revenue Service have been 
investigated or disciplined since 1989 for using government computers to browse 
through the tax returns of friends, relatives and neighbors, Sen. John Glenn 
(D-Ohio) said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn, chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, said that of the 
1,300 IRS employees investigated nationwide, more than 500 cases occurred in 
the last 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The nationwide figures on IRS employee snooping into tax files were compiled 
after Glenn disclosed in August, 1993, that almost 370 employees in the 
agency's Southeast region had improperly examined taxpayer accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosure brought expressions of outrage from several senators and of 
concern from tax specialists, who said they were surprised that so many workers 
could be accused of abusing their positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much of this was prelude to fraud and how much was just prurient window 
peeping is difficult to say," Glenn said in a statement. Calling the nationwide 
figures disturbing, he said the IRS has a moral and legal obligation to protect 
the confidentiality of taxpayer records. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn said more than 420 of the IRS cases have resulted in some type of 
disciplinary action and that several hundred cases are still under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In remarks prepared for delivery to Glenn's committee today, IRS Commissioner 
Margaret M. Richardson said the agency now has a better system for detecting 
unauthorized use of its computers and a strong penalty guide. She said future 
data systems will be less vulnerable to such abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson's testimony points out that fewer than 1% of IRS computer users 
have been found to have misused their access to accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioner also said she has appointed an IRS "privacy advocate," Robert 
Veeder, to oversee efforts to safeguard taxpayer records. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn's committee was to discuss the new data on IRS snooping at a hearing 
scheduled for today. It will also look at the potential for fraud involving 
taxpayers who file for inflated or phony refunds. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn learned about IRS employee snooping after the General Accounting Office 
reported that the IRS "did not adequately control access authority given to 
computer support personnel or adequately monitor employee accesses to taxpayer 
data." 
</P>
<P>
 IRS documents Glenn released last year showed that the agency had been 
investigating regional employees for about three years. A few of the cases 
involved workers who looked up the accounts of celebrities. At least one 
employee was reported to have altered about 200 accounts and received kickbacks 
from bogus refunds.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: EISNER SITUATION RAISES QUESTION OF FIRMS' NO. 2S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At Team Disney headquarters, the Burbank building whimsically held aloft by 
the Seven Dwarfs, people once used the term Disney magic to describe the 
successful working partnership between Chairman Michael D. Eisner and President 
Frank G. Wells. Now that their spell has been broken -- with Wells' death in a 
helicopter crash in April and Eisner temporarily sidelined by quadruple bypass 
surgery -- it's the sleight of hand behind the scenes that everyone is focusing 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Disney remains one of Corporate America's great Cinderella stories, 
analysts say in hindsight that Eisner may have created a void when he built the 
entertainment conglomerate itself faster than he did its management ranks. 
Annual revenue at Disney grew from $2 billion to $8 billion over the last 
decade, but without anywhere near the same kind of rise in its support staff. 
</P>
<P>
 At the company, which is legendary for its workaholic culture, executives 
privately complain that Eisner is much more inclined to add to their existing 
responsibilities -- as he did when he dispersed Wells' duties among them -- 
than to restructure management or bring in new executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney formally denies there is a manpower crisis. Eisner, 52, in typical 
nose-to-the-grindstone fashion, spent the early part of Monday dictating 
instructions to key executives from his hospital bed at Cedars-Sinai Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts and people close to Disney's board say Eisner will be pressured to 
change his ways when he returns to work. But they also stress that Disney's 
management structure is far from unique. Many entertainment conglomerates, not 
to mention many of the biggest public companies in general, spin on the finger 
of a single chief executive.  
</P>
<P>
 "These companies are run by unique and strong individuals," said entertainment 
analyst Jeffrey Logsdon of the Seidler Cos. in Los Angeles. "The very thing 
that drives most of these guys to the top keeps them from having somebody with 
the same skills in a secondary spot." 
</P>
<P>
 News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch, for one, has never had a clear heir 
apparent. That's sparked increasing concern recently as Murdoch has taken on 
responsibility for running Fox Inc., the high-profile division that includes 
20th Century Fox and the Fox TV network. 
</P>
<P>
 In Murdoch's case, it may come down to the all-in-the-family syndrome. Sources 
say the 63-year-old executive has left the No. 2 spot vacant because he's 
grooming one of his children to eventually succeed him. Should something happen 
to him in the interim, people close to Murdoch predict, his wife, Anna, would 
temporarily take over the vast company. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Time Warner Inc., the world's largest entertainment company, Chairman 
Gerald R. Levin also works without a net. 
</P>
<P>
 Levin, who inherited the chief executive's job when Steven J. Ross died 20 
months ago, faces a different problem than Murdoch. With so many strong 
division heads, sources say, the Time Warner chief would face a mutiny if he 
singled out one to be president. 
</P>
<P>
 Other companies with succession problems include the three major networks and 
cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom Inc., though, has a strong No. 2 man in Frank Biondi. The same goes for 
MCA, where Sidney J. Sheinberg has worked under Lew R. Wasserman for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The succession issue has taken on added urgency at Disney because of the 
unforeseeable nature of recent events. Wells' death and Eisner's illness three 
months later delivered a shocking one-two punch to a company known for having 
one of the industry's most stable management teams. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "They had all the necessary ingredients to run Disney," said one source. 
"Michael and Frank always understood how it worked, and Frank wasn't waiting 
for Michael to retire." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to Eisner agree that he never warmed to the idea of sharing 
power after Wells' death, even with an executive as capable as studio Chairman 
Jeffrey Katzenberg in the wings. Eisner is also said to be resistant to the 
idea of bringing in too many new senior executives. The Disney chairman 
frequently talks about the value of trust and is known to rely heavily on his 
wife, Jane, for counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 With Disney's announcement that Eisner is recuperating quickly, Wall Street 
gave the company a nod of confidence on the first day of trading since his 
surgery. Disney stock closed up 25 cents at $42 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
A spokesman said Eisner had no history of heart trouble. But outsiders were 
skeptical that such a problem could go undetected, because chief executives of 
publicly traded companies routinely undergo physical exams. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent appearances, Eisner looked as robust as ever. But some analysts 
believe Disney has grown far too big for one person to manage -- particularly 
someone like Eisner, who's more hands-on than executives such as Levin. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few months alone, Eisner has been on the front lines of a battle 
to win approval for a controversial historical theme park in Virginia, 
supervising efforts to rescue Euro Disney and helping to launch the Broadway 
version of "Beauty and the Beast." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very busy time for the company," said Harold Vogel, an 
entertainment analyst with Merrill Lynch in New York. "What Eisner needs is a 
coordinator -- and someone to put the long-term strategy" into action. 
</P>
<P>

 Working retreat: Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone and Tele-Communications Inc. 
Chief Executive John Malone used a Sun Valley, Ida., investment seminar hosted 
by Allen & Co. last week as an excuse to sit down and iron out some 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did have some very friendly, constructive talks in Sun Valley," Redstone 
said. He refused to provide specific details, but Viacom and Liberty Media are 
believed to be weighing a variety of deals as part of an effort to settle 
Viacom's antitrust suit against TCI and its affiliate, Liberty Media. 
</P>
<P>
 One discussion centers on a merger of their Encore and Showtime pay TV 
services. Liberty is also one of the finalists in the bidding for Viacom's 
Madison Square Garden properties, which include the New York Rangers and New 
York Knicks. Viacom is in the second round of auctioning off the Garden, which 
it acquired in its purchase of Paramount Communications. Sources said the 
bidders include Canadian brewer John Labatt Ltd. and Nike.

ARCO PLANS TO LAY OFF 1,250 MORE EMPLOYEES; ENERGY: THE CUTBACKS WILL INCLUDE 
SEVERAL HUNDRED WORKERS AT THE OIL COMPANY'S LOS ANGELES HEADQUARTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a surprisingly deep cut, Atlantic Richfield Co. announced Monday that it 
will lay off an additional 1,250 workers, including several hundred at its 
high-rise headquarters in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The oil company said it plans to take after-tax charges of about $150 million 
in the second quarter for costs related to the new round of layoffs. It said it 
expects the cutbacks and other operating changes to save $400 million annually 
by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has been hurt by falling oil prices and an inability to find new 
sources of petroleum, particularly in Alaska, where its oil supply from the 
North Slope has been in decline for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Headquarters employees learned of the job cuts in a memo circulated Monday, 
but they will not know for several days who will be laid off. 
</P>
<P>
 The company employs about 1,600 people on its headquarters staff, most of them 
in Los Angeles. About 400 of the cuts are expected to come from the 
headquarters office. The rest will occur at other Arco facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unhappily, the majority of the 1,250 jobs are in California," Arco spokesman 
Albert Greenstein said. "All I can say is that these reductions represent the 
major reductions in our restructuring program."  
</P>
<P>
 The latest cuts are in addition to 2,050 layoffs already described in the 
companywide reorganization first announced last fall. A total of 3,300 jobs 
will have been trimmed by the end of 1995, leaving Arco with 23,000 employees 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 A new round of layoffs had been predicted at Arco's shareholders meeting in 
early May by Chairman Lodwrick M. Cook and Mike R. Bowlin, who became chief 
executive on July 1. Bowlin had also predicted both "cost cutting and perhaps 
some paring of our capital spending." 
</P>
<P>
 But the latest layoffs are "bigger than I expected," said George Schink, 
president of the industry analysis group at AUS Consultants in Conshohocken, 
Pa. "But looking at their prospects, they probably decided to make the big step 
now as opposed to later." 
</P>
<P>
 Arco, the nation's seventh-largest oil company, has had trouble finding new 
oil, particularly in Alaska. And it has been hit harder by the economic 
problems in California than the other major oil companies, Schink noted, though 
all of them have been hurt by falling prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "This second quarter is probably going to be the worst for the oil companies, 
so this is the time to take your charges," said Holly Gustafson, an energy 
analyst with NatWest Securities Washington Analysis in Washington. "And 
restructuring is a very popular thing to do. There's no better way to increase 
the price of your stock than to lay a few people off." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts and the stock market clearly approved of the move. Arco shares jumped 
$2.125 to $107.875 on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, nearing the 1994 
high of $112.375.  
</P>
<P>
 Being more dependent on revenue from oil and gas production than refining or 
marketing, Arco has been particularly sensitive to the low oil prices that have 
plagued the industry lately.  
</P>
<P>
 The company's failure last year to find significant new oil reserves at its 
Kuvlum and Cook Inlet exploration sites in Alaska only put more pressure on it 
to trim operations and turn overseas in its oil hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Arco has brought on some new Alaskan wells in recent years, its 
production in the state has slipped from a peak of 487,000 barrels a day in 
1988 to 420,000 barrels a day last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Arco has had better luck finding natural gas. Its largest non-U.S. development 
is in a giant gas field in the South China Sea. Production began in 1993 at two 
offshore gas developments in Indonesia, and the company will explore for more 
gas in the East China Sea and Britain.  
</P>
<P>
 "What really concerns me about this company is that they have had trouble 
finding new oil reserves," Gustafson said. "They're relatively new players 
overseas compared to others." Gustafson noted that the company is expected to 
have about $3.6 billion in cash because of an upcoming issue of debt securities 
with one of its majority-owned subsidiaries, Lyondell Petrochemical, along with 
the recent sale of 17.7% of Vastar Resources, an Arco gas subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 12, Arco announced a preliminary deal to invest $1 billion over the 
next 25 years in an enhanced oil-recovery project in Algeria, from which it 
could begin producing oil as early as 1995. Arco believes it could triple the 
25,000-barrel-a-day production at the Rhourde el Baguel Field, receiving up to 
49% of the crude. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly all of that helps," Gustafson said, "but I think they need 
something big. They need an acquisition. . . . If they make a smart 
acquisition, they can be a great company."

MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ: NEW DESIGNS: BEVERAGE MAKERS CAN HARDLY CONTAIN

 Peter Baram never imagined his idea would pop up on 28 million beer cans. 
</P>
<P>
 But go figure. His biotechnology firm, Xytronyx Inc. of San Diego, recently 
developed a way to make a special ink turn visible only when exposed to 
sunlight. That caught the eye of Coors Light, whose big summer promotion has 
turned Xytronyx's technology into a glitzy marketing gimmick. Coors Light cans 
now feature summer images that show up only when the sun shines. 
</P>
<P>
 During the hot summer months, it's not just what's in the can that matters. 
It's what's on it. The beverage giants amass up to 50% of their sales between 
Memorial Day and Labor Day. And the big players are increasingly relying on new 
bottle and can designs to lure consumers. Coke and Pepsi are marketing new 
bottles this summer. Like Coors, Miller is testing new gimmicks with its cans. 
Even Perrier has given its bottle a face lift. 
</P>
<P>
 "A package is a silent salesman," said Frank Delano, chairman of the New 
York-based Delano Group, a corporate image specialist. "It is telling the 
consumer, 'Pick me up and buy me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 For years, however, many beverage makers resisted anything but surface 
redesigns of their cans and bottles, out of fear of confusing the consumer. 
"The big soft drink companies are just beginning to realize that can design is 
not sanctified by God," said Jesse Meyers, publisher of Beverage Digest. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverage makers will spend months tinkering with new designs for cans or 
bottles, hoping to boost sales. "It's a way to get people to physically respond 
to your product," said Tom Pirko, president of the New York consulting firm 
Bevmark. "These days, when something about a brand seems stale, the first 
impulse is to make the container look different." 
</P>
<P>
 But a new container sometimes opens its own can of worms. 
</P>
<P>
 Witness Coca-Cola, which four years ago introduced "Magic Cans" that were 
supposed to magically dispense instant cash when opened. Coke filled the cans 
with water instead of cola, separated from the cash rewards with special seals. 
Some consumers who broke the seals tried to drink the murky water. And many 
cans had glitches that kept the cash prizes from popping out. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts say beverage makers need to put the brakes on container redesign. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a tremendous risk in tinkering too often with the bottle or can," 
said Clay Timon, chairman of Landor Associates, a San Francisco design firm. 
After all, a brand's image often depends on its familiar design. "You can wake 
up one day and find yourself in promotional cans 11 months of the year" and 
face a shrinking of the brand's value, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Coors Light has basically kept its latest cans unchanged -- except for 
those ultraviolet-light-sensitive designs that appear about 90 seconds after 
the sun hits them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consumers are fascinated with the concept of having an image seemingly appear 
out of nowhere," said Steve Ritter, brand director for Coors Light. The images 
on the so-called Sun Cans include sunglasses, headphones, diver's masks and 
cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say the increase in can and bottle redesign began about three years 
ago and that the trend has continued to gain momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Coors tried to lure consumers with "talking" cans, which 
contained tiny, light-activated silicon chips that -- when the tabs were pulled 
-- spoke to beer drinkers. Miller Lite tried a new twist this summer by 
substituting T-shirts for beer in thousands of its cans. "Consumers saw it as 
added value," said Rob Olejniczak, brand director. But it also resulted in 
complaints from some thirsty customers who were unhappy when they popped a top 
and found a shirt instead of a cold brew. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Perrier, which has long resisted changing the look of its bottled water, 
has begun testing a design change to its bottles sold in restaurants. The 
bottles come sealed in clear plastic with illustrations of people and animals 
that appear to be etched on the bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 "This represents the lighter aspect of the brand," said Jan Lazgin, a company 
spokeswoman. "Things got too serious for a while," she said, referring to the 
benzene contamination scare of 1990 that resulted in Perrier being voluntarily 
recalled by the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Can and bottle redesign in the soft drink industry is often aimed at 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepsi's new "'Big Slam" one-liter bottles are being heavily promoted by 
basketball superstar Shaquille O'Neal because the center for the Orlando Magic 
has such strong appeal with teen-agers, said Rob Meyer, director of package 
innovation at Pepsi. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to step back and say, 'How can we reinvigorate the category without 
changing the formula?' " Meyer said. "The idea is (that) teens like to be seen 
with these bottles." 
</P>
<P>
 When Cherry Coke rejiggered its can last summer, it changed the color to a 
bright purple-and-black design with illustrations of red cherries. "It allows 
Coke to say to kids: 'We're hip. We're cool. We're breaking all the rules just 
like you,' " said Scott Mednick, whose Culver City firm, Mednick Group, 
redesigned the container. 
</P>
<P>
 Mednick also designed Coke cans distributed to students at 1994 spring break 
hot spots. The collectible cans tried to appeal to youngsters with special 
"Spring Break 1994" logos. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, Coke introduced a bottle redesign that goes back to its roots. 
But again, teen-agers are the real target. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a million teen-agers have been mailed empty plastic Coke bottles that 
look similar to the contour glass bottles Coke discontinued in the mid-1970s, 
said Susan McWhorter, director of package development at Coke. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind this mass mailing is Coke's decision to bring back the contour shape 
after polling consumers -- including thousands of teen-agers -- and discovering 
that most prefer the contour bottles. Along with the plastic bottles, 
teen-agers were sent coupons for free Coke. 
</P>
<P>
 (Supply is a problem, so the bottles aren't likely to make it to California 
until next year, a spokeswoman said.) 
</P>
<P>
 And while McWhorter wouldn't confirm it, one beverage industry insider says 
Coke is even considering one shape no one has yet put on the shelf: contour 
cans. Briefly . . .  
</P>
<P>
 For an estimated $50 million in stock, the Interpublic Group of Cos. has 
purchased the New York ad agency Ammirati & Puris and is merging the holder of 
the Burger King ad account into its Lintas New York agency. . . . The Santa 
Monica agency Rubin Postaer & Associates has consolidated its media buying with 
its division, RP alpha, which handles Honda dealership ads. . . . The Los 
Angeles office of D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, which recently won the Blue 
Cross and Lockheed ad accounts, plans to hire six additional employees. . . . 
Nike will become the official footwear and apparel sponsor of U.S. soccer in 
1995. . . . The Western States Advertising Agencies Assn. has named Bob Kresser 
of Santa Monica-based Kresser/Craig as its president for 1994-95.

THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY AFTER THE SETTLEMENT

 Saturday's settlement of the Microsoft antitrust case, under which the 
software power agreed to alter some business practices, is not expected to have 
a dramatic impact on the software business in the short term. But even if 
Microsoft retains dominance in desktop PC software, it may have trouble 
extending its success to a number of new, fast-growing markets.  
</P>
<P>
 Desktop: Microsoft DOS and Windows have more than 80% of the market for PC 
operating systems, which control basic computer functions. New Windows release 
-- Chicago -- likely to solidify Microsoft's dominance. Apple, with the 
Macintosh, has not succeeded in breaking out of a narrow niche, despite 
superior technology. Novell's DR-DOS, a competitors to MS-DOS, could be aided 
by the settlement, but still viewed as a minor player. In mainstream 
"applications" such as word processors and spreadsheets, Microsoft gaining 
ground, but Lotus Development (1-2-3 spreadsheet) and Novell (Wordperfect word 
processor) still strong. Main battleground now in consumer applications, 
including education and personal finance software. Incumbents such as 
Broderbund and Intuit -- and many small companies developing CD-ROM software -- 
face tough challenge from Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
 High-end Corporate Server Market: Microsoft trying to crack the IBM-dominated 
corporate computing world with Windows NT, advanced operating system for 
corporate computing and controlling networks of PCs. Sales disappointing thus 
far, but company has high hopes for new release, dubbed Daytona. Big Blue still 
pushing OS/2 as a high-end operating system for corporate PCs, and offers a 
range of specialized software for its large mainframes and minicomputer 
systems. Novell attacking here with new versions of Unix. Hewlett-Packard, Sun 
Microsystems, DEC, and Silicon Graphics have highly regarded server hardware, 
and mostly support some version of Unix along with proprietary software. All 
have high hopes for emerging "video server" business as well, where Microsoft 
is pushing PC-based Tiger system. Oracle, a database software company, also a 
player in video servers. 
</P>
<P>
 Networking: Microsoft hopes NT will be its answer for linking PCs, but faces 
an uphill battle against entrenched Novell Netware. Lotus's Notes product has 
defined a new category, groupware, for software that makes it easy to 
collaborate across networks -- Microsoft yet to come up with a reposte. 
</P>
<P>
 Hand-held Computing: Microsoft hopes to set standard with WinPad software for 
pocket-sized, pen-operated computers. But Apple's Newton, though widely 
criticized, has thus far defined the category. AT&T a big player here thorough 
acquisition of Eo and Go. Market slow to develop. 
</P>
<P>
 Interactive TV: Battle for "set-top box", computerized device that will 
control consumer access to interactive TV networks, has just begun. Microsoft's 
Modular Windows considered an inadequate solution, but company is working with 
Intel, General Instruments and others to build something better. Silicon 
Graphics developing set-top software for Time Warner cable trial. Apple/IBM 
joint venture, Kaleida Labs, and game company 3DO also aspire to set standard 
on the set-top. Cable TV and other media companies have key role in selecting 
technology, many are suspicious of Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
 On-line Information Services: Microsoft plans to launch its own online service 
in competition with America Online, Prodigy, Compuserve and others. Will also 
attempt to provide much of its own "content," -- news and other information, 
games, educational services. Every major media conglomerate and thousands of 
small companies have big plans here.

 Steady Growth Predicted for Air Travel: The International Civil Aviation 
Organization in Montreal said a recovery in world airline passenger traffic 
should continue through 1996. In an annual three-year forecast, ICAO -- the 
United Nations' watchdog on the airline industry -- said total scheduled 
passenger traffic on the world's airlines is expected to grow 5% this year. For 
1995, the ICAO forecast 6.4% growth and for 1996, another 7.1%.

 De Beers Raises Stakes in Canada Diamond Rush: The company jumped into the 
fevered race to build the first diamond mine in Canada's Arctic region, 
announcing that it will spend up to $360 million to develop a promising 
discovery. The secretive South African concern, which controls the world 
diamond market, said it reached an agreement in principle to explore and 
evaluate land held by two tiny firms: Tanqueray Resources Ltd. and Mill City 
Gold Mining Corp. If the property lives up to hopes, De Beers Consolidated 
Mines Ltd. would build a mine probably in early 1998 and earn a 51% stake in 
the project.Two main ventures -- a cooperative led by Britain's RTZ and the 
other by Dia Met Minerals Ltd. -- have been racing to develop a mine by 1997.

 Time Warner Inc., the world's biggest media-entertainment company, reported a 
smaller loss for the second quarter and an increase in earnings before interest 
and other non-operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's publishing operations showed the strongest growth, due to 
advertising gains and special issues of People, Sports Illustrated and Life. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnings also grew at Time Warner's music, film and HBO divisions, but cable 
systems were down due to new cable rate rules, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner's loss applicable to common shares was $23 million, or 6 cents a 
share, in the three months ended June 30. A year ago, the comparable loss was 
$83 million, or 22 cents a share. Early retirement of debt reduced 1993 
second-quarter earnings by $35 million, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue rose 9% to $3.73 billion, from $3.43 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization were $748 
million in the latest quarter, compared to $711 million in the year-earlier 
period.

EARNINGS: LENDING GROWTH BOOSTS BANKS' PROFITS; FINANCE: HIGHER FEES FOR 
CONSUMER BANKING SERVICES ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO HIGHER SECOND-QUARTER NET INCOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Strong growth in lending and higher fees from consumer banking services 
boosted second-quarter profits at several major banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase Manhattan Corp. saw earnings rise 32%. Charlotte, N.C.-based NationsBank 
Corp. was up 43%, and Keycorp in Cleveland was up 13%. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers charged more on their credit cards, and businesses borrowed more 
money to pay for expanding operations, fueling double-digit loan growth at 
large regional banks. But the banks felt a pinch in their mortgage businesses 
as fewer consumers sought to refinance housing loans because of higher interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Checking account fees and service charges helped boost fee income at many 
banks. With loans up, banks earned more from interest payments than they paid 
out in interest on deposits. Fees from managing money for wealthy individuals 
and businesses also increased in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase Manhattan earned $307 million, or $1.46 a share, compared to $233 
million, or $1.20 a share, during the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fees and commissions from consumer and global corporate banking activities 
grew 24% to $480 million. Credit card fees, as well as fees from money 
management and corporate finance, were up. Unlike many banks, Chase booked 
higher fees from mortgage banking activities due to the acquisition last year 
of a mortgage company and because the bank booked losses in its mortgage 
business a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Offsetting its good news: A downturn in the stock and bond markets and 
volatility in foreign exchange caused Chase to make less money from buying and 
selling securities and currencies on behalf of clients and for its own 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading revenue fell 19% to $151 million. Foreign exchange trading revenue was 
down $7 million to $78 million, and trading account revenue dropped $29 million 
to $73 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad loans and foreclosures were down 53% to $1.46 billion compared to a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first six months of the year, Chase earned $671 million, or $3.27 a 
share, compared to $386 million, or $1.95 a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase shares closed unchanged at $38.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 NationsBank earnings totaled $437 million, or $1.58 per share, compared to 
$306 million, or $1.20 per share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of new loans and leases rose 11% to 94.6 billion. Loans to 
consumers were the biggest contributor to the overall increase, the bank said. 
Loan growth was also higher because NationsBank bought several banks last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Net interest income -- representing interest earned on loans minus interest 
paid on deposits -- grew by 18% to $1.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The growth came from making higher-interest loans while keeping interest rates 
on deposits steady. 
</P>
<P>
 NationsBank continued to make improvements in its problem loan portfolio. The 
number of loans that are in default fell 13% to $1.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Profit for the first six months rose 45% to $854 million, or $3.10 per share, 
compared to $587 million, or $2.30 per share, during the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 NationsBank shares were up 62.5 cents at $55.125 on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 Keycorp's net income rose 13% to $222 million, or 89 cents a share, compared 
to $209 million, or 85 cents a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's prior-year results were restated because Keycorp merged with 
Society Corp. in March. The two banks pooled their assets, so last year's 
figures represent the sum of both banks' financial results. 
</P>
<P>
 Total loans were up 17% to $43.2 billion. Areas with the most loan growth 
included the Rocky Mountain states, the Northeast and the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortgage banking profit was down $8.4 million to $19.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Net interest income was up 1% to $695 million. Income earned from service fees 
and other non-interest-related sources was down 11% to $227.4. Lower fees from 
insurance, brokerage and trust services accounted for the drop. 
</P>
<P>
 Profit totaled $430 million, or $1.74 a share, in the first six months of the 
year, compared to $386.8 million, or $1.58 a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Keycorp's shares closed down 37.5 cents at $31 on the NYSE.

FLUOR WINS $1-BILLION CONTRACT FOR PLANT IN KUWAIT; CONSTRUCTION: THE 
ENGINEERING FIRM WILL BUILD A PETROCHEMICAL FACILITY, ITS FIRST MAJOR VENTURE 
THERE SINCE THE 1960S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In its first major venture in Kuwait since the 1960s, Irvine-based Fluor Corp. 
said Monday that it has won a $1-billion contract to build a petrochemical 
plant there. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract was awarded by a joint venture of Union Carbide Corp. and 
Petrochemical Industries Co. of Kuwait. When completed in 1997, the plant is 
expected to be one of the world's largest petrochemical complexes, producing 
products such as anti-freeze and plastics. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said competition for the job was fierce. Bechtel Corp. of San 
Francisco and Parsons Corp. of Pasadena both made strong bids, said George 
Fischer, a Newport Beach-based publisher of a newsletter that tracks 
international construction deals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fluor got the contract because they had a better mousetrap and they charged 
less money," Fischer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction on the project, set to start next year, will be overseen by the 
company's Fluor Daniel subsidiary office in Houston and will involve as many as 
5,000 workers, most of them from the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal will help boost Fluor's already-impressive backlog. At the end of its 
latest fiscal quarter, the company had orders for projects totaling $14.9 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kuwait contract "was one they were pursuing for a while," said John N. 
Simon of the brokerage Seidler Cos. in Los Angeles. "There hasn't been a lot of 
money spent anyplace in the chemical or petrochemical industries for a while -- 
not only in the U.S. but elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 An oil refinery Fluor built in Kuwait in 1968 was destroyed during the 1991 
Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of low petroleum prices and the damage done by the war, oil-rich 
Kuwait has not spent money in recent years for major new oil facilities. The 
bulk of the work there has involved capping burning oil wells and repairing 
damage at sites that were not destroyed, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think spending in the Middle East is as strong as it might have been 
given stronger oil prices, but it is by no means a small market," said Douglas 
R. Augenthaler, analyst for the brokerage Oppenheimer & Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest contract more than doubles the order backlog Fluor has in the 
Middle East.  
</P>
<P>
 In Monday trading, Fluor's stock closed at $54.25 a share, up 25 cents, on the 
New York Stock Exchange. Fluor's Middle East Millions 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the Gulf War, revenue from Middle East contracts increased 
impressively at Fluor Corp.'s Fluor Daniel unit from 1989-93. A majority of the 
revenue is generated by contracts in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

U.S. SANCTIONS URGED ON CANADIAN WHEAT; TRADE: ITC SAYS WEAK CURRENCY, OTHER 
FACTORS HAVE BROUGHT A FLOOD OF IMPORTS. 
</P>

<P>
 The International Trade Commission recommended Monday that the United States 
slap sanctions on Canadian wheat to stem a surge of imports. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade relations between Washington and Ottawa have soured over the wheat 
dispute.The United States is concerned about a rise in what it says are 
subsidized wheat imports, especially after floods devastated U.S. crops last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The ITC, an independent U.S. trade agency, found the low value of the Canadian 
dollar, Canadian rail subsidies, marketing practices of the Canadian Wheat 
Board, surpluses of Canadian feed wheat and high U.S. demand had led to a flood 
of imports. 
</P>
<P>
 The ITC makes recommendations on trade disputes, but its actions are not 
binding. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the six commissioners called for 10% duties on imports of Canadian 
wheat above 500,000 metric tons. Two commissioners called for limits above 
900,000 tons, and the other commissioner wanted an 800,000-ton quota. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, U.S. duties of 10% kick in only after non-durum Canadian wheat 
imports surpass 1 million tons. Since the United States rarely imports above 
that level, duties have largely been absent. 
</P>
<P>
 The two commissioners recommending the 900,000-ton ceiling also proposed 
raising the duty to 35% on non-durum wheat and to 15% for durum and semolina. 
</P>
<P>
 The ITC recommendations are not binding, and congressional sources predict 
that President Clinton will not act on them until at least next week.

LABELS TO SHOW FOREIGN CONTENTS OF CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buyers of cars and light trucks will be able to learn how American or foreign 
a new vehicle is, starting Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1992 law effective on that date requires new cars and trucks weighing 8,500 
pounds or less to bear labels telling where the parts of the vehicle were made. 
</P>
<P>
 Content would be measured by the dollar value of components, not the labor 
cost of assembling vehicles. That is expected to raise the apparent foreign 
contents of cars assembled in North America by Japanese auto makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, percentages of North American and foreign parts would have to 
be given as an average for each car line. For example, the percentage shown 
would be the same for all Honda Accords or Ford Tauruses, no matter where the 
individual vehicle was assembled. 
</P>
<P>
 But the label would also have to show the place of assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan has been welcomed by the major American auto makers, but Japanese 
firms have called it a nuisance that doesn't accurately reflect the North 
American value of their products assembled here. 
</P>
<P>
 The labeling requirement was sponsored by Rep. Bob Carr (D-Mich.) and Sen. 
Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers are free to design the label, which can be included on the price 
sticker or fuel economy sticker or can be separate. If separate, the content 
label must measure at least 3 inches by 5 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Each label would have to show: 
</P>
<P>
 * Overall combined percentage of parts that originated in the United States 
and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 * Names of other countries that supplied more than 15% of the vehicle's parts 
and the percentage from each. If several countries accounted for more than 15%, 
only the two main origins would have to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where the vehicle was assembled. 
</P>
<P>
 * Country from which the engine originated. 
</P>
<P>
 * Country of origin of the transmission.

 IMF Chief Urges Further Deficit Cuts: The United States must slash its 
government budget deficit further and possibly raise interest rates again to 
help prolong its economic expansion and aid the dollar, Michel Camdessus said. 
At a news conference to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of the 
International Monetary Fund, Camdessus also suggested that Europe and Japan 
consider cutting their rates to allow their budding recoveries to flower. 
What's needed "is close coordination of efforts among all of these key 
countries," the IMF managing director said.

 General Dynamics, UAW Reach Tentative Pact: The defense company's tank 
business said the agreement, if ratified this week, could end, as early as July 
25, a monthlong strike of 1,900 United Auto Workers workers in the Detroit 
area; Lima, Ohio, and near Scranton, Pa. The General Dynamics Land Systems 
workers, who make parts and assemble armored tanks and radios, struck after the 
company asked them to help pay for their health benefits.The three-year 
contract calls for them to pay for 10% of their coverage, the UAW said; 
managers and non-union workers would pay for 20%. Union workers would also get 
3% raises for the first and third years and a 3% lump-sum payment the second 
year, the union said. The average union wage is $17.20 an hour.

BOTTOM FALLS OUT FOR SYNERGEN; BIOTECHNOLOGY: FIRM'S BLOOD-DRUG TRIALS END IN 
FAILURE. IT WILL CUT ITS STAFF BY HALF AND EXPLORE POSSIBLE MERGER OR SALE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters

<TEXT>
<P>
 Synergen Inc. said Monday that its lead product, Antril, has failed in 
clinical trials for treatment of the blood infection sepsis and that it will 
cut its staff in half, an announcement that sparked a steep drop in the 
company's stock price.  
</P>
<P>
 Synergen's stock lost nearly half its value in heavy trading after the 
announcement and closed down $4.375 at $4.50 on the Nasdaq, where it was the 
second-most-active issue in afternoon trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street analysts said the company may become a takeover target. 
</P>
<P>
 Synergen Chief Executive Gregory Abbott said in a conference call with 
reporters that the company plans to discuss with outside advisers possible 
options such as a merger or sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boulder, Colo.-based biotechnology company said it stopped the trial 
because an interim analysis of the Antril data showed a "lack of efficacy." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is profoundly sad for sepsis patients and the medical community, as well 
as for our stockholders and Synergen employees and our many collaborators 
outside the company who have labored so long and hard and believed so intensely 
in this program," Abbott said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Synergen said that in order to conserve cash, it will restructure the company 
and cut its staff of 630 by more than half. "We anticipate reducing staff by 
more than 50%," a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Synergen said it has $135 million in cash. Piper Jaffray analyst Barbara 
Hoffman said it spends about $20 million a month; she expects the figure to 
drop to $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it will look at using its facilities to make drugs for other 
companies and that it expects its board to approve a business plan by the end 
of next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Synergen is the latest company to fail in efforts to find a drug to treat 
sepsis, an often fatal blood infection that is a common cause of death in 
hospitals. Among the others are Centocor Inc., Chiron Corp. and Xoma Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said that despite Synergen's cost-cutting moves, prospects are 
limited for the once-high-flying biotech stock.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think Synergen is in big trouble. . . . Now that a second Phase III (Antril 
for sepsis) trial has failed rather convincingly, Synergen does not have much 
left," First Boston analyst Jeffrey Swarz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said there is little reason to believe Antril will succeed in 
clinical trials for a second use: rheumatoid arthritis. Antril is currently in 
Phase II trials for rheumatoid arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
 While Antril for sepsis was clearly expected to be the crown jewel, Synergen 
is conducting other clinical evaluations. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is doing clinical evaluations of treatments for amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease; for Parkinson's disease, and for 
Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said investors also have little hope for Synergen's only other 
product in late-stage development: ciliary neurotrophic factor, or CNTF, for 
Lou Gehrig's disease -- following the recent failure of Regeneron 
Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s product for the same use. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had two products -- one which failed rather convincingly and another 
that doesn't look particularly promising," Swarz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowen & Co. analyst Carol Werther said prospects are dim for Synergen as a 
fully independent, operational company, but not for investors interested in 
bottom-fishing for value. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say they look like a very attractive takeover candidate, especially 
at $5 a share. . . . They have real assets that could be of value to other 
companies, especially if they're looking for new products," Werther said. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock's high for the year was $14.375. It had traded as high as $66.25 in 
the fourth quarter of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Piper Jaffray's Hoffman said, "This makes the company an acquisition candidate 
or headed for a partnership or merger."

RJR NABISCO ROLLS OUT FAT SUBSTITUTE SALATRIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite the notable failure of others to cook up a successful fake fat, RJR 
Nabisco Holdings on Monday introduced a low-calorie fat substitute that can be 
used in a wide variety of foods. 
</P>
<P>
 RJR Nabisco's product -- Salatrim, which is made from vegetable oils and other 
foods -- joins a long list of other fat substitutes concocted by companies such 
as Procter & Gamble and Monsanto. Most of those fake fats have failed to win 
the approval of either government regulators or consumers' taste buds. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nabisco -- looking at using Salatrim in its products, which include Oreo 
cookies and Ritz crackers -- says it can avoid the failure of its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of fat substitutes, currently less than $100 million annually, could 
reach as much as $1 billion, according to some estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Nabisco officials say Salatrim comes closer than competing products to 
imitating the richness and texture of fat. However, a gram of Salatrim contains 
five calories -- more than half those of real fat. That's because it is only 
partly absorbed by the body. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Salatrim is not considered a synthetic compound, the Food and Drug 
Administration has accepted a Nabisco petition to have it included on a list of 
substances the federal agency considers "generally recognized as safe." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Nabisco and its partner in the product, Pfizer Inc., can start 
selling Salatrim as they await the FDA's final say -- avoiding the years of 
delay that have held up some rival fake fats. 
</P>
<P>
 "By mid-1995, consumers can expect to see it in products," said Hank Sandbach, 
a Nabisco Foods Group spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfizer, which has also developed its own fat substitute, and Nabisco see a 
broad range of potential uses for Salatrim. 
</P>
<P>
 While Pfizer tries to sell it to other companies, Nabisco has the exclusive 
right to use Salatrim in cookies, crackers, salty snacks and margarine in North 
America for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the past failures of other food giants' fake fats leave many industry 
analysts doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
 Procter & Gamble, for example, has watched its lead over rivals disappear in 
the seven years since submitting its Olestra synthetic fat to the FDA for 
testing and approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA considers Olestra, unlike Salatrim, a new substance that therefore 
needs more intensive safety studies than a product derived more directly from 
natural ingredients, according to George Pauli, director of the FDA product 
policy division. 
</P>
<P>
 Monsanto's NutraSweet division introduced its all-natural Simplesse fat 
substitute in 1988. Like Salatrim, Simplesse was categorized by the FDA as 
"generally recognized as safe" in frozen desserts. But slow sales led Monsanto 
this year to discontinue Simple Pleasures ice cream, its flagship brand 
containing Simplesse. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's well known (that Simplesse products) haven't been nearly the market 
success that NutraSweet hoped," said Gail Greenwald, managing director at 
Arthur D. Little Inc. in Cambridge, Mass.

 Coca-Cola Co., PepsiCo Inc. and other major producers of diet sodas have asked 
a New York judge to dismiss a lawsuit seeking compensation for drinkers of 
stale beverages sweetened with aspartame. 
</P>
<P>
 The consumer suit, which seeks class-action status, was filed in April in 
Kings County (N.Y.) Supreme Court.It was first reported Monday in Beverage 
Digest, a trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
 A Coca-Cola spokeswoman declined to comment and Pepsi officials could not be 
reached.

 The suit also names Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., Coca-Cola Nestle Refreshments 
Co. U.S.A., Pepsi-Cola Co., Seven-Up Co., Pepsi/Lipton Tea Partnership, Cadbury 
Beverages Inc., Canada Dry Bottling Co. of New York and Snapple Beverage Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit says the companies committed fraud by failing to inform consumers 
that drinks with aspartame, which is sold under the name NutraSweet, can go 
stale while on store shelves.

COMPANY TOWN; ARISTA REPORTS 2ND STRONG YEAR, WITH '94 PROFIT UP AT LEAST 12%; 
EARNINGS: THE GERMAN-OWNED LABEL DOES NOT RELEASE SPECIFIC FIGURES, BUT IT SAYS 
IT HAS DONE WELL WITH NEW ACTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For a label that recently had a hit single called "Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm," Arista 
Records is hardly at a loss for words when it comes to letting the world know 
how well it is doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing its 1994 performance as "phenomenal" and an "explosive streak," the 
company said Monday that for the fiscal year ended June 30, it in effect 
matched the previous year's strong sales figures of $250 million to $300 
million, when the company had the top-selling "The Bodyguard" soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Arista is owned by Bertelsmann Music Group of Germany, it does not 
release specific profit figures. But Clive Davis, Arista founder and president, 
said in an interview that year-to-year profit rose 12% to 15%, coming on top of 
the huge 70% jump in profit for fiscal '93. 
</P>
<P>
 The '94 results mark another strong year for the label in pop, black music and 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Arista has been especially successful in breaking new acts, which tend to be 
more profitable than established stars, who can negotiate bigger advances and 
more lucrative deals for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Arista has done especially well with "The Sign," the Ace of Base debut album 
that is on the way to becoming one of the year's top sellers.  
</P>
<P>
 Arista officials said "The Sign" has sold more than 4.5 million copies 
domestically and some 10 million copies worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Other top-selling Arista artists include Toni Braxton -- whose debut album on 
Arista's LaFace label has sold 4 million copies -- country stars Alan Jackson 
and Brooks & Dunn from its Nashville operation, and Crash Test Dummies of "Mmm 
Mmm Mmm Mmm" fame. Sales also continued to be strong over the year for Kenny 
G's "Breathless" album and for Whitney Houston -- whose songs made the 
"Bodyguard" soundtrack such a hit. 
</P>
<P>
 BMG Chairman Michael Dornemann said in a statement that he is elated with 
Arista's performance, adding that its success extends into "every single 
international territory." 
</P>
<P>
 However, industry executives note that the results also illustrate just how 
much BMG has come to depend on Arista, which accounts for most of its music 
business, and the way Arista outperformed other BMG units such as RCA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arista is clearly the jewel in BMG's crown," one industry observer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The past two years' results have also helped the company bury its most 
embarrassing scandal. It was embroiled in controversy in 1990 and 1991 when the 
members of its top-selling, Grammy-winning act Milli Vanilli admitted that they 
did not sing on their best-selling "Girl You Know It's True." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said the past two years have been among the most satisfying for him in 
his lengthy music career. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who started Arista 19 years ago, headed Columbia Records in the late 
1960s and early 1970s, signing groups that went on to become some of the top 
acts in rock. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is comparable to the period when I had Janis Joplin; Blood, Sweat & 
Tears; Chicago; Santana; Billy Joel, and Bruce Springsteen," he said.

 Music: More than 20% of the staff at Walt Disney's troubled Hollywood Records 
were laid off Thursday as part of a move to trim overhead costs, the company 
confirmed. The 14-worker layoff brings the number of employees to 50.The 
company said the cuts affected all areas except publicity and artists and 
repertoire. Hollywood Records -- whose roster includes Queen, former Stray Cat 
Brian Setzer and the 1960s British group the Dave Clark Five -- has been a 
major problem for Disney, which since 1989 has been unable to gain much of a 
foothold in the music business. Bob Pfeifer, a former Epic Records executive, 
was named to replace former label chief Peter Paterno in February, though the 
label is really being run by Walt Disney Studios Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg. 
Katzenberg was given that responsibility even before Walt Disney President 
Frank G. Wells died in April. The label does have the hit Elton John single 
"Can You Feel the Love Tonight?" from "The Lion King" soundtrack, but not the 
soundtrack itself. The soundtrack is on Walt Disney Records and is now the 
top-selling album in the country. Hollywood Records is expected to release the 
soundtrack to the coming Robert Redford film "Quiz Show." JAMES BATES

 Biotech leader Genentech Inc. said surging sales helped its second-quarter 
earnings more than triple compared to a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Profit for the quarter ended June 30 increased to $33.4 million, or 28 cents a 
share, from $10.4 million, or 9 cents a share, in the second quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue increased 15% to $194.9 million from $169.8 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The profit surge was fueled in part by increased demand for the drug t-PA. 
Quarterly sales of the clot-dissolving drug, also known as Activase, increased 
32% to $73.5 million.

PROPERTY VALUES: DESPITE EARTHQUAKE, OFFICE VACANCY RATE HASN'T TUMBLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON GALPERIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After the January earthquake, commercial real estate brokers were predicting 
that office vacancies in the San Fernando Valley would be cut in half by this 
summer to about 7% and that lease rates would rise as tenants displaced by the 
temblor found new space. 
</P>
<P>
 The predictions have yet to come true. In fact, commercial real estate 
brokerage firms are reporting an office vacancy rate of between 13% and 16% in 
the Valley. Making matters worse is what's known as a negative net absorption 
rate in almost every part of the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Conejo 
valleys. Negative net absorption means that more tenants were moving out of 
these areas than were moving in. 
</P>
<P>
 During May and June a total of 508,000 square feet of office space was leased 
in the San Fernando Valley, according to commercial real estate broker Julien 
J. Studley Inc. in Encino. That's a decline of 16% from the 606,000 square feet 
leased during the same period last year -- which back then was considered a 
weak market. 
</P>
<P>
 The vacancy rate -- which is based on a percentage of existing office space 
that is vacant -- has experienced a drop in some markets since the quake. 
However, much of this drop can often be due to the fact that certain buildings 
were taken out of commission by the January quake, not because more space is 
being leased. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're looking for even bleaker news, consider this: Many leases that were 
signed in the first six months of this year were short-term deals signed as 
stopgap measures for tenants displaced by the quake. Within a year, many 
smaller tenants who previously occupied their own buildings will move back into 
their old offices and the vacancy rate for multi-tenant office buildings will 
rise again. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake did have a beneficial effect on office vacancy rates, but we 
won't see any big improvements absent another disaster," said Michael Zugsmith, 
chairman of commercial real estate brokerage Zugsmith-Thind Inc. in Encino. "We 
lost 1 million square feet of office space in a few seconds, but there hasn't 
been any great improvement in office vacancy rates." 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley's healthiest market is Encino, Zugsmith said. Overall, 
the East Valley has an office vacancy rate of about 7%, which is enviable 
compared to other Southern California office markets. How long this submarket's 
vacancy rate will stay that low is uncertain, though, Zugsmith said, because 
many of the new tenants in the area are there temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that will not be driving up vacancy rates is new construction. Grubb 
& Ellis Research Services Group reports no new multi-tenant office construction 
completed during the first six months of this year in the San Fernando and 
Santa Clarita valleys as well as the Simi Valley area. The only reported 
multi-tenant project under construction is a 40,000-square-foot office building 
in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 At least half of the leasing activity in the San Fernando Valley this year has 
been earthquake-related and not necessarily permanent, said Jeffrey M. Woolf, 
managing principal at Lee & Associates in Sherman Oaks. Various federal 
agencies leased more than 200,000 square feet of space after the quake to serve 
victims. And various insurance companies also leased extra space to handle the 
avalanche of claims. By the end of the year, these tenants will be gone, Woolf 
said. Most of the recent lease deals are for no longer than 18 months. Some of 
the tenants will disappear altogether and many will move back to their old 
offices when they are fixed up, Woolf said. 
</P>
<P>
 One bright spot, Woolf said, is in the market for office buildings up for 
sale. Because there is no new construction, prime office buildings are a good 
buy for investors. And, he said, investors who were scared away by the quake 
are now back in the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Another positive sign in the Valley office market is that there aren't many 
large, contiguous blocks of space available for large tenants, observed Arthur 
Suazo, a broker with Julien J. Studley. "The few large blocks of space have 
been gobbled up," he said. The one notable exception is Warner Center Plaza III 
in Woodland Hills, where only 12,000 of the 592,000 square feet in the building 
have been leased in the 2 1/2 years after its completion. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial real estate brokers in Ventura County seem to have benefited the 
most from all the earthquake-related office and industrial facility moves. 
Grubb & Ellis statistics show that more than 1.5 million square feet of vacant 
office, industrial and retail space has been absorbed since January. This 
compares with 1.8 million square feet absorbed in all of 1993. Overall in 
Ventura County, the office vacancy rate stood at 17% in mid-1994, compared to a 
shocking 29% in 1991. All it takes is a handful of deals to tilt the statistics 
one way or another. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news for Ventura County can be traced in large part to a handful of 
transactions. In Oxnard, for example, GTE leased 115,000 square feet in the 
never-occupied Chevron building and Kinko's leased 50,000 square feet at 1000 
Town Center Drive. Now, it remains to be seen if the upward trend in Ventura 
County will hold steady.

FORMER NEWHALL CHP CAPTAIN DIES AT 62 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID E. BRADY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kenneth E. Forster, a veteran officer for the California Highway Patrol who 
served 11 years as captain of the CHP's Newhall station, has died. He was 62. 
</P>
<P>
 Forster, a Valencia resident for four years, died of pneumonia Saturday at 
Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital following a long battle with leukemia, 
said CHP Officer Wendy Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1975, after several assignments with the CHP in such cities as Indio, Napa 
and San Francisco, he moved to the Santa Clarita Valley after he was promoted 
to captain and appointed to run the CHP's Newhall station. Diagnosed with 
leukemia in 1981, he retired in 1986 after 30 years in law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Following his retirement, he spent much of his time fishing, hunting, camping 
and traveling, said his wife, Francine. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in San Francisco, Forster spent much of his early life in the Bay Area, 
completing a bachelor's degree in business. After a friend's encouragement, he 
joined the Highway Patrol in July, 1956, as an officer in the Indio station. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his wife of 36 years, he is survived by a son, Ken Forster of 
Eugene, Ore.; a daughter, Lisa Nagler-Wright of Canyon Country; two brothers, 
Len Forster and Ron Forster; and three grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 A visitation is scheduled tonight from 7 to 9 at Eternal Valley Mortuary, 
23287 N. Sierra Highway, Newhall. A funeral Mass will be held at 10 a.m. 
Wednesday at Our Lady of Perpetual Help Catholic Church, 23233 W. Lyons Ave., 
Newhall. Burial will follow at Eternal Valley Memorial Park. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Francine Forster, memorial donations may be made to a charity of 
the donor's choice or to the CHP's Widows and Orphans Fund, P.O. Box 161209, 
Sacramento 95816-1209. The fund assists families of CHP officers killed in the 
line of duty.

CENTURY 21 EXPANDS ITS WORLD REACH; REAL ESTATE: THE IRVINE-BASED COMPANY IS 
ADDING TO ITS 6,000 FRANCHISES OPERATING IN 14 COUNTRIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ken Ojiri, a Century 21 broker in Tokyo, has never erected a "For Sale" sign 
in the front yard of a Japanese house, even though he is one of the top real 
estate agents in that country. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be a shame here to sell the house you inherited from your parents. 
It was a loss of family face, honor," Ojiri said. "That's not the case so much 
anymore, but we still don't use signs. Also, the yards are too small." 
</P>
<P>
 Cultural differences such as that are regularly a challenge for Century 21 
Real Estate Corp. as the Irvine-based company carries its American-style 
marketing to the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in Orange County in July, 1971, by local brokers Art Bartlett and 
Marsh Fisher, Century 21 now has 6,000 franchises worldwide, including more 
than 1,200 independently owned operations in 14 countries overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not revolutionize the real estate industry in countries we go into," 
said Michael C. Evans, senior vice president of foreign operations at Century 
21. "We bring them a level of sophistication they have not seen. American 
selling techniques are way ahead of the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there are certain words, certain real estate techniques that we are 
familiar with here," he said, "that simply don't translate." 
</P>
<P>
 In Belfast, for example, being a Century 21 real estate broker is a delicate 
task. Brian Shields is not only concerned with whether his clients find the 
right house at a good price, he must reassure them about the safety of the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some people who come in and want to know if they will be safe. It is 
very sensitive at times, especially for the local police force," he said. "We 
often rely on the questions they ask us, then hopefully guide them in the right 
direction -- the best geographical location for them in which to purchase." 
</P>
<P>
 Some adaptations are more a matter of style. In Paris, where Century 21 has 
about 350 franchises, the female brokers have their own fashion, sprucing up 
the requisite mustard-colored, gold-buttoned blazers with leather mini-skirts 
and brightly colored scarves. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Prompted in part by the real estate downturn in the United States, the company 
has set a new goal: becoming the biggest realtor in the world. Century 21 
opened 30 franchises last week in Australia, expanding operations there. In 
June, the company opened 30 offices in Hong Kong. Now, Century 21 is eyeing 
ventures in Germany, Taiwan, Vietnam and Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very careful about the countries we go into," said Richard A. Spencer, 
the company's vice president of international expansion. "We want to be sure we 
will have a success. We don't want any failures whatsoever. We want to be a 
household name throughout the world. " 
</P>
<P>
 Already in all 50 states, Guam and Puerto Rico, the company, which was 
acquired by Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. in 1987, has operations in Canada, 
Japan, France, the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland, Australia, Papua New 
Guinea, New Zealand, Mexico and Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.  
</P>
<P>
 Now Century 21's competitors are following suit. RE/MAX International Inc., 
the Denver-based brokerage now in a bitter court battle with Century 21 to 
determine which company can advertise itself as the nation's largest real 
estate firm, this year signed agreements to open franchises in Eastern Europe 
and Western Europe. It will open offices in Madrid early next year, said Daryl 
Jesperson, executive vice president of RE/MAX. It now has about 500 franchises 
in Canada, Mexico, Hong Kong and the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 "Century 21 has been very aggressive overseas. It's done fairly well in 
England and very well in France," Jesperson said. "We're just getting in the 
door in Europe, but we're going to be looking for a share of that market. It's 
an interesting arena because the practices vary so greatly from country to 
country. There's big business to be had there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Century 21, the toughest market by far has been Japan. Though the company 
has been there since the early-1980s housing boom, a resistance to American 
selling techniques has limited its success. Also, because of the stigma 
attached to selling a family dwelling, real estate brokers were not highly 
regarded. 
</P>
<P>
 To counter that image, the company "ran television ads in Japanese saying we 
were friendly and nice and our brokers were good people, and slowly things 
began to change," Evans said. "We've changed the way real estate is done 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 That strategy was apparently successful. Century 21 now has nearly 300 
franchises in Japan and plans to expand to more than 700, though a real estate 
downturn is dampening plans for more growth this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Century 21, RE/MAX and others are looking for places to expand, and they are 
all targeting Japan," said Louis Masotti, director of the real estate 
management program at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what's happening here in the States is that they are tripping over 
each other. There are just too many franchises here, and they are all intruding 
on each others' territories. So bringing American real estate expertise 
overseas makes sense," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Masotti said the toughest challenge for all of the real estate firms overseas 
will likely be working effectively within various cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you know how to do something well, the trick is being able to do that 
same thing successfully somewhere else," he said. Century 21 Worldwide

 Statordyne Corp.: The firm said Monday that it expects to post a loss of $2.1 
million on sales of $600,000 for its latest fiscal year, which ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim-based manufacturer of electrical power systems projected earlier 
that it would show an annual loss of $1.8 million on sales of $1.9 million.But 
the shipment of three systems valued at $750,000 was moved from its 1994 fiscal 
fourth quarter to its 1995 fiscal first quarter, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Statordyne said it has not yet received from two customers orders totaling 
$550,000 that it expected in the fiscal fourth quarter. The company said it 
expects to be profitable in fiscal 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Statordyne also said it got $311,000 in orders for two power protection 
systems, one going to South Africa's state-owned electricity utility, Eskom, 
and the other to Power System Solutions of Kansas City, Mo.

COUNTY SEE FEW CHANGES FROM SETTLEMENT OF CHARGES AGAINST SOFTWARE GIANT.

 Computer industry executives in Orange County say they do not forecast big 
changes resulting from Microsoft Corp.'s agreement to settle antitrust charges 
by adjusting the way it sells operating systems to personal computer makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Safi Qureshey, chairman of AST Research in Irvine, a leading PC manufacturer, 
summed up his feelings on Microsoft's signing of a consent decree with the 
Justice Department with one word: relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a sense of relief that it is over," he said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shannon Jenkins, chief executive at TouchStone Software Corp. in 
Huntington Beach, said she "didn't hear anything encouraging" in news reports 
following the agreement reached Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the accord, Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, agreed to end 
certain sales practices, such as charging computer makers a lower price for its 
operating system based on each machine they sell regardless of whether 
Microsoft software was actually installed.  
</P>
<P>
 Most industry watchers generally agree the settlement will not have a big 
immediate impact on PC makers or on their customers, given the limited nature 
of the settlement and Microsoft's dominance of the software industry -- it 
controls 85% of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Qureshey said he believes only 1% of his customers currently have a serious 
interest in outfitting their computers with an operating system other than 
those made by Seattle-based Microsoft. As such, Qureshey said he does not see 
any significant change in his business. 
</P>
<P>
 But on a less tangible level, Qureshey said he viewed the settlement as 
positive because it removes a "potential black cloud" that may have depressed 
sales for his company and for the entire marketplace.  
</P>
<P>
 Qureshey also said he was happy that the dispute did not go to trial because 
if it had, AST would likely have been asked by the government to turn over 
documents on its business relationship with Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
 AST -- the world's fifth-largest personal computer maker -- had already been 
required to provide Justice officials with some information, Qureshey said. He 
declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Software makers like TouchStone criticized the accord, saying it had hoped 
Microsoft would be forced, among other things, to make faster and fuller 
disclosures to the entire industry about changes to its operating system, which 
is critical to rival software publishers because they must design products so 
they're compatible with them. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, TouchStone's Jenkins said that her firm -- with about $5 million 
in annual sales and 35 employees -- recently bailed out of an agreement to 
develop an Internet-related software product because of concerns that Microsoft 
could soon come out with its own software that could have devoured it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping for some powerful results from what the Justice Department was 
doing," Jenkins said. "I'm fairly disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 David Hanna, chairman of State of the Art Inc., an Irvine-based maker of 
accounting software that does not directly compete with Microsoft, said he 
expects the settlement to be positive for his company in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the accord calls for less restrictive non-disclosure agreements, Hanna 
says that will enable his company to have a more open relationship with 
Microsoft.  
</P>
<P>
 In the same vein, Ron Siede , director of marketing for Kingston Technology, 
said the settlement may indirectly give a boost to his company. 
</P>
<P>
 Kingston, based in Fountain Valley, makes hardware that upgrades computer 
memory. Siede said he believes the settlement will push the market to come out 
with new software faster than before.

SOME IGNORE, SOME HEED CENTER REPORT ON MEXICAN FOOD; NUTRITION: O.C. 
RESTAURANTS AND FAST-FOOD EATERIES DO OFFER HEALTHY OPTIONS BUT ADMIT SOME MENU 
ITEMS CAN BE HIGH IN FAT AND SODIUM.

 A report Monday that Mexican-style food contains too much fat and sodium -- 
enough on some platters to constitute a stick of butter -- is something that 
Janee Allegre is going to take with a grain of salt. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something wrong with everything you eat nowadays," the Huntington 
Beach woman said as she walked out of El Torito Grill in Costa Mesa after lunch 
Monday. "Every week, it's something different." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it's high-fat movie theater popcorn or cream-sauce-covered fettucine 
Alfredo, the bad nutritional news simply "goes in one ear and out the other," 
Allegre said. 
</P>
<P>
 Diners and restaurateurs didn't show much concern about a report from the 
Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington consumer organization 
specializing in food and nutrition. The center's report stated that popular 
items at typical Mexican restaurants far exceed the federal government's 
recommended daily limit of fat, saturated fat and sodium. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's researchers, after adjusting their data for serving size, 
determined that typical Mexican food served at sit-down restaurants isn't much 
different nutritionally than anything offered at a local Taco Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Allegre and others who ate lunch at El Torito agreed that those who care about 
their diets watch what they eat, even at Mexican restaurants where it might not 
be so easy to figure out how much fat and salt and how many calories are hidden 
in the carnitas plate or the burrito combination. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County restaurant owners said that diners, regardless of what they say, 
do care about eating healthy food when they go out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why else have all the major fast-food chains -- even McDonald's -- taken all 
lard out of frying?" asked J.D. Williams, a stockbroker who owns PJ's Casa 
Fiesta in Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 PJ's, for instance, uses soybean oil for frying and offers a menu approved by 
the American Heart Assn. Other Mexican-style eateries -- typically small, 
family-owned ones -- also promote what they say is "healthy" food, though 
nutritional information isn't usually provided on menus. 
</P>
<P>
 At Taco Mesa, manager Ezequiel Levy uses vegetable oil for frying and very 
little salt -- "just for taste," he said. "Our logo is 'healthy and authentic.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Chevys, a San Francisco chain with three Orange County sites, said its "fresh 
Mex" concept offers low-fat, low-calorie items, like chicken and vegetable 
fajitas, vegetarian black beans and vegetable burritos. Acapulco Mexican 
Restaurants in Long Beach offers similar fare along with a promise to cook the 
food the way the customers want it. 
</P>
<P>
 But they acknowledge that Mexican food can contain a great deal of fat and 
sodium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even those with healthier lifestyles will go to a Mexican restaurant for a 
change of pace," said Fred Wolfe, Acapulco's senior vice president. Customers 
also expect to fill themselves up with food that isn't always the best for 
their arteries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not afraid of being El Gordo ," Jim Belsha of Beverly Hills, who eats 
Mexican food once or twice a week. "I wash it all down with a lot of beer." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kim Thompson of Newport Beach is a careful eater. He stopped eating 
popcorn at movie theaters after the Center for Science in the Public Interest 
reported earlier this year that theater popcorn was loaded with fat and sodium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could see where a taco salad with sour cream and refried beans and all the 
other things in a big tortilla bowl is definitely bad for you," he said. "But 
at least here (El Torito Grill), the taco salad comes on a plate and is mainly 
just lettuce with grilled chicken breast on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Decker, visiting Costa Mesa from Chesterfield, Mo., figures he'll "slow 
down on nachos" after learning that a plate of tortilla chips smothered in 
cheese and other toppings can have the fat equivalent of a quarter-pound stick 
of butter. 
</P>
<P>
 His friends, Rudy Villicana and Jennifer McCasland, both of Westminster, are 
avid patrons of Taco Bell, where a seven-layer burrito contains 485 calories, 
21 grams of fat -- including 8 grams of saturated fat -- and 1,115 milligrams 
of sodium. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's report did not cover fast food, but researchers used the 
nutritional value in Taco Bell items as comparisons with the food they sampled 
from sit-down restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Taco Bell spokeswoman Janis Smith said that the fast-food chain 
offers some low-fat or low-calorie menu items and will test-market "healthier 
options" this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine-based El Pollo Loco, also part of the fast-food industry, criticized 
the center's report because it "ignores the high nutritional value" of such 
fare as its "flame-broiled" Mexican-style chicken. The chicken and side dishes 
"are among the healthiest choices available in the quick service industry," 
said Lou Franson, the company's marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Greg Johnson in Costa Mesa and Jeff Leeds in Washington, 
D.C., contributed to this report.

 Valentec International Corp. said Monday it has signed a preliminary agreement 
to sell its four remaining manufacturing units, including its Wells Division 
military ordnance plant in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Valentec said it plans to sell the units to CPI Aerostructures Inc. of 
Ronkokoma, N.Y, in a cash and stock deal.Details were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Valentec, the Costa Mesa holding company for a diversified group of 
manufacturing companies, said CPI wants to acquire its computer components and 
medical prostheses unit in Minnesota; a defense materials plant in Wales; the 
Wells munitions unit; and a related ammunition systems integrator based in 
Clearwater, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 The four companies have about 275 employees, including 140 in Costa Mesa. 
Combined revenue is expected to top $40 million next year. 
</P>
<P>
 CPI is not expected to lay off any of the workers or relocate any of the 
factories, said Kathie Krumwiede, Valentec's controller. 
</P>
<P>
 Valentec originally owned six companies but took the two other units public in 
May, forming a new business called Safety Components International. Valentec is 
48% owner of Safety Components, an automotive air bag manufacturer that has 
about 50 employees in Orange County and more that 500 at plants in Mexico and 
Great Britain.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: STOCK BROKERAGE, 2 PRINCIPALS FINED AND EXPELLED BY NASD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Costa Mesa stock brokerage, Unex Capital Corp., and two of its principals 
have been expelled from the securities industry, the National Assn. of 
Securities Dealers said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Unex principal Lawrence Robert Hazlewood was fined $50,000 and barred from 
associating with any NASD member, while Mona Lynn Houseworth, also a principal, 
was fined $15,000. The company itself was fined $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The association said the actions were taken because Houseworth allowed 
Hazlewood to act as a principal and help run Unex though Hazlewood had never 
passed the qualifying test to become a principal and never registered with NASD 
as a principal. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Hazlewood nor Houseworth could be reached for comment.

CERADYNE CRITIC GAINS BOARD SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A major shareholder in Ceradyne Inc., upset with continued losses at the maker 
of industrial ceramic components, voted against the company's slate of board 
nominees Monday to add its own director to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 R.B. Haave Associates Inc., a New York investment adviser, elected William 
Lamphear as its representative on the board at Monday's annual meeting of 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 But the board's slate also was able to be elected intact after shareholders 
approved increasing the number of board seats from seven to eight. Joel P. 
Moskowitz, Ceradyne's chairman, said the objective now is simply to move on in 
an effort to return the company to profitability. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's first-quarter loss narrowed to $189,000, or 3 cents a share, 
from $487,000, or 8 cents, for the same period a year earlier. Revenue rose to 
$4.5 million from $4.11 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Haave stated in a document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
that it thinks "the company has not responded with sufficient speed to stem 
these losses nor effectively marketed through joint ventures its proprietary 
technologies."

FLACO JIMENEZ . . . BY POPULAR DEMAND; POP MUSIC: HE NEVER EXPECTED TO HAVE

 Q: What's the definition of an optimist?  
</P>
<P>
 A: An accordion player with a beeper.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That and other squeeze box-insensitive jokes may have been common in years 
past, but the wheel has turned, to the point that now there are prospective 
employers who wish accordionist Flaco Jimenez would start sporting a beeper. 
</P>
<P>
 It would sure make things easier for people like producer Don Was, who had a 
tough time locating the hard-touring Norteno musician to appear on the new 
Rolling Stones album. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand it took awhile for him to track me down," Jimenez said by phone 
recently from his home in San Antonio. "I was on tour playing in San Francisco 
three months ago while they were recording in Hollywood, and at the gig I get a 
message in the dressing room from Don Was. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Who in the hell is Don Was?' Then they said he was producing the 
Stones and they wanted me to go record with them. I almost flipped, man. Wowee, 
good news. The next day I was in the studio with them -- didn't have time to 
listen to the song or do homework at all." 
</P>
<P>
 The track on "Voodoo Lounge" that resulted, "Sweethearts Together," has been 
getting played all over San Antonio radio, and stations have been calling 
Jimenez for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 He's already one of the city's better-known citizens: He was one-fourth of the 
hit-making, genre-busting Texas Tornados (he and members Freddy Fender and 
Augie Meyers still do gigs, though Doug Sahm left to do other projects and took 
the band name with him). 
</P>
<P>
 He has recorded with Ry Cooder, Bob Dylan, Santana, Dwight Yoakam, Linda 
Ronstadt and a host of others; and before all that he was a dance-hall favorite 
at home, the pioneering son of conjunto music pioneer Santiago Jimenez Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1937, Santiago Jimenez Sr. had been the first San Antonio accordionist to 
make a record of the gloriously celebratory border music. (Flaco's brother 
Santiago Jr. also follows their father's footsteps as an accordion-playing 
performer and recording artist.) 
</P>
<P>
 Flaco, who was born in 1939, took his father's style and updated it with rock 
and country influences, but still with a familial warmth and dignity, while 
maintaining the essential traditions and emotion of the music. Then he took it 
to the world. 
</P>
<P>
 He may be treated like royalty in London and Japan, but at home, "I'm just old 
Flaco Jimenez. I like to go to the 7-Eleven store like anyone," he said. 
"People do recognize me and ask what's up next or ask for autographs, but it's 
not a big star thing. I feel as human as anyone else. I like to be just me." 
</P>
<P>
 As much as he loves the music he plays on his three-row button accordion, he 
never expected it to find a global audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that it was always just going to be a local thing. I'd only hear my 
dad and other groups in San Antonio, or even here just in the barrio. I think 
that audience started changing when I began to 'bilingual' a lot of stuff and 
started playing rock 'n' roll and with a little country to it. Then the 
reaction of the people, not just the Chicanos but the Anglos, was stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 He went from local light to modest international recognition on the folk scene 
when musicologist Chris Strachwitz recorded him for his Arhoolie label and when 
he was featured in a 1974 Les Blank film on Texas-Mexican border music. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in 1976, Cooder tapped him to be a member of his Chicken Skin Revue, and 
he has since worked with Cooder on several projects, including the soundtrack 
to the 1982 film "The Border," which starred Jack Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really have to credit Arhoolie and Ry with giving me the hand to get this 
music heard by a larger audience. I recorded for ages here, man, with local 
labels, and I was known around San Antonio, and that was it. It was like I was 
in a crater here. I was really surprised the first time I went to London and 
found that, because of their help, people there had heard of me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The outside attention he and his music have received has made the conjunto 
scene better in San Antonio, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of someone just saying, 'Oh, there goes another Tex-Mex accordion 
player,' it has gained more respect because of the exposure it has gotten. This 
type of music and this instrument for years was just classified as a party 
joke. An accordion? Now it's a different story. Everyone wants an accordion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took somebody to introduce it, and I'm lucky it was me who got to say, 
'Listen to this blend with the Stones or Dwight Yoakam.' People say, 'I didn't 
know.' Well, now you know," Jimenez said with pride. 
</P>
<P>
 The music industry is among those who have showed tangible appreciation for 
Jimenez's brand of Tex-Mex music: He won the first of his two Grammy Awards for 
Best Mexican-American Performance in 1986 for his "Ay Te Dejo en San Antonio" 
album. The second came in the same category in 1990 for "Soy de San Luis," a 
song written by his father that appeared on the Texas Tornados' debut album. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Jimenez developed his music playing in noisy neighborhood dirt-floor 
dance halls, he said he didn't experience any difficulty in translating it to 
the concert hall and recording studio. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can play for 50 people or 5,000, and it feels the same to me," he said. 
"People that know I've played this music with big stars say, 'Hey, how did you 
do it, recording with Linda Ronstadt and bla-bla-whoever with this music.' I 
say, 'It's just music.' There's nothing that different about any of it that you 
can't find a way for them to meet." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On his most recent solo album, 1992's "Partners" on Reprise, several stars he 
had played with over the years returned the favor, including Yoakam, Ronstadt, 
John Hiatt, Los Lobos and Emmylou Harris. He has a new album due in October on 
the new Arista Texas label, which will include country singers Lee Roy Parnell, 
Radney Foster and Mavericks lead singer Raul Malo. He says the songs will be 
done in a number of styles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't go away from my roots and tradition, but I like to versatize , put 
that tradition in new places." He'll be putting his tradition in a museum 
Wednesday as he plays in the summer concert series of the Long Beach Museum of 
Art. It's far from his weirdest gig; he says that honor goes to a European show 
he once played for workers at a nuclear power plant.  
</P>
<P>
 He actually prefers the gigs that aren't like his hometown dance-hall shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like doing those, but I think I like concerts better because you get more 
attention. In a dance like we do here, you can play from 8 at night till 2 in 
the morning, and as soon as you start playing -- poom ! -- they start dancing. 
They just want to dance to the music, not admire the guy that's playing or 
singing. You give them any conjunto and they're happy. In concerts you know 
that somebody is really listening to hear what you're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 If people are dancing, Jimenez has no one but himself to blame. When asked 
what he tries to communicate with his music, he responded, "I would say 
happiness. I hate to see a sad face in the audience. I like to cheer them up 
and make them dance." 
</P>
<P>
 He thinks that people need a release after a hard day of work, and he's glad 
to provide it. 
</P>
<P>
 "People need a boost, man, a good glass of beer and a real good happy tune. 
It'll do the job. I've tried it myself, and it works. Sometimes I take not just 
one beer, but three, and I feel even better," he said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez currently spends six to eight months of the year on the road. He tries 
never to be gone for too long a stretch, explaining, "I've got a pretty 
good-sized family, so I do my best to stay home. I've got eight kids, three 
still at home and grandkids all over the place here. I've got a real 
understanding wife and she takes care of things, but still, papa's got to be 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when many regard racial and social differences as a divisive wall, 
Jimenez maintains that they can be a bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to share culture. The main thing for me is to share my music, my race, 
my culture, whatever it takes to gain a friend, man. Music and food, that's 
what I like, the basic things we have to agree on and communicate." 
</P>
<P>

Art, 2300 E. Ocean Blvd., Long Beach. 7 p.m. $8-$10. Under 12, free. (310)

LOOKING AT THE NEWS WITH A SKEWED EYE; TELEVISION: MICHAEL MOORE DOESN'T 
PRETEND TO SHOW EVENTS OBJECTIVELY. HIS 'TV NATION' TAKES A TWISTED, COMICAL 
LOOK AT SUBJECTS FROM PETS ON PROZAC TO AVON LADIES IN THE AMAZON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the onslaught of reports on O.J. Simpson, the mainstream press has missed 
one angle that Michael Moore, a political activist, writer and filmmaker, plans 
to explore on his new NBC series, "TV Nation." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen a news story with more product placement," observed Moore, 
40, best known for his 1989 documentary "Roger & Me." "First of all, you have a 
two-hour commercial on the Ford Bronco, seen by 95 million people across the 
country. In the newspapers and on the news every night, how many hundreds of 
mentions have there been of McDonald's, where Kato and O.J. went to eat? 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course," he added, "you've got to feel sorry for the guys at Ford watching 
'the chase,' which was really a crawl. They had to be sitting in their chairs 
screaming, 'It goes faster than 40 miles per hour! O.J., step on it!' Can you 
see them pulling their hair out?" 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the mind of Moore, where conventional news stories take on an 
entirely different spin. He doesn't offer any pretense of objective journalism 
-- a practice Moore calls a subtle sham. All journalists act subjectively, he 
believes, by choosing what to present and how to present it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe any journalist is objective," he said. "But the traditional 
media has had to put on the air, create the illusion, that they are playing it 
straight down the middle." 
</P>
<P>
 In "TV Nation," an insurrectionary newsmagazine premiering tonight, Moore and 
his associates (who include "Roger & Me" cohorts and comedy writers for David 
Letterman and Spy Magazine, among others) take an unabashedly opinionated and 
comical perspective on their subjects, which include pets on Prozac, a 
real-estate broker pushing houses along a toxic dump site, a day with Dr. Jack 
Kevorkian and Avon ladies in the Amazon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to do a show like this because, for all the amount of reality TV, 
which is a ton, the one area you can't get the networks to say yes to is 
reality TV with a humorous edge to it," said correspondent Merrill Markoe, who 
used to write for Letterman when he was at NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Every segment of "TV Nation" has an agenda. In one entitled "Neighbors," Moore 
rents a home in the quiet suburbs of Long Island, N.Y., and hires an actor to 
portray a serial killer living there. He paints "666" on the mailbox, fires off 
guns in the middle of the night, drags body bags in and out of the house in 
broad daylight, splashes the windows with red paint and blasts Mussolini 
speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 Through all this, his neighbors, whom "TV Nation" interviewed later, never 
called the police. Moore's point was to illustrate the sad dissolution of the 
friendly neighborhoods he knew when he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's what makes it work," Moore explained of "TV Nation's" subjective 
viewpoint. "You're taking two forms that seem opposed to each other -- comedy 
and documentary -- and combining them. You're guaranteeing everything you see 
is true. Everything you see is as we film it. Yet we've injected our point of 
view and our sense of humor into the piece, so it has a sort of subversive 
quality to it." 
</P>
<P>
 That's exactly how Moore got started as a filmmaker. He was sitting at home in 
Flint, Mich., collecting unemployment after losing his job as editor of the 
leftist Mother Jones magazine, when he saw former General Motors chairman Roger 
Smith on TV announcing more factory shutdowns. Moore decided to make a 
documentary, learning filmmaking along the way, that centered on his 
unsuccessful efforts to interview Smith and ask him why he was doing this. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore became a hot Hollywood property when "Roger & Me," produced for 
$250,000, turned into the most profitable documentary ever, according to the 
trade paper Variety, with total revenues exceeding $30 million. Moore, a 
college dropout from a long line of factory workers, made out big because his 
deal called for him to receive a percentage of the profit. 
</P>
<P>
 In the time since, he has signed a feature-film deal with Warner Bros., 
started a foundation to support independent filmmakers and community groups, 
and directed a feature-film comedy called "Canadian Bacon," set for release 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was in Los Angeles two years ago hawking his "Canadian Bacon" script, 
he received a call from several NBC and TriStar Television executives. 
</P>
<P>
 "They asked me, if I was given an hour of prime-time television, what would I 
like to do on it?" he recalled. "When they put it like that, my first reaction 
was, 'Well, are you sure you've got the right Moore? Are you sure you don't 
want Roger Moore or Dudley Moore?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With reality programming on the rise, NBC wanted to see if Moore could work 
his engaging "Roger & Me" magic on TV. "We're looking at a television landscape 
that has an awful lot of reality programming -- all forms of information," said 
Warren Littlefield, president of NBC Entertainment. "But there's not that many 
reality formats for comedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore finished the pilot for "TV Nation" more than a year ago. NBC tested it 
in blue-collar Scranton, Penn., and received excellent feedback. 
</P>
<P>
 But NBC passed on it as a series last fall and then again this fall. 
Littlefield said NBC was waiting to secure some foreign deals. Once the British 
Broadcasting Corp. came in to share the show's already bargain cost of $500,000 
per episode, NBC finally ordered six episodes for a summer run. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt, 'All right, when is a good time to try something like this?' It's 
perfect for the summer, when there are a lot of series repeats," said 
Littlefield, who will consider "TV Nation" as a midseason replacement series 
for the fall, if it does well.  
</P>
<P>
 Aside from a short "Roger & Me" sequel that aired on PBS called "Pets or 
Meat," the general public has not heard from Moore in several years. In the 
overnight fame game, does "TV Nation" represent a critical juncture in his 
career? 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a question I've been asked since I was 18," he sighed, referring to 
his news-breaking feat of being elected to the local school board as a 
teen-ager. "I understand the question well, but I wonder how many more things I 
have to do in my life before I don't have to answer it anymore. I was one of 
the first 18-year-olds elected to public office. It was on the national news 
everywhere, because essentially no other 18-year-old had been elected before. 
It was kind of like, what do you do now for an encore?" 
</P>
<P>
 Moore went on to start his own newspaper, the Flint Voice, which eventually 
grew into the Michigan Voice and gained a reputation as one of the best 
alternative newspapers in the nation. He edited the paper for 10 years before 
moving on to Mother Jones.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not worried about what's next, and I certainly don't worry about making 
any money," Moore said. "We lived on $10,000 to $15,000 a year in Flint. When 
you've done that for most of your adult life, you're never frightened by the 
fact that the money may be gone tomorrow, because you've lived your life a 
certain way and you know how to do that." 
</P>

WORLD CUP FINAL, 'TENORS' SET NEW HIGHS ON LOCAL FIELDS; TELEVISION: SUNDAY'S 
BRAZIL-ITALY SHOWDOWN IS LIKELY TO RANK AS THE MOST-WATCHED SOCCER GAME IN U.S. 
HISTORY. THE CONCERT BROUGHT IN RECORD PLEDGES FOR KCET AND KOCE. 
</P>

<P>
 The final World Cup game Sunday drew impressive television ratings locally 
and, while not as strong nationally, seems likely to rank as the most-watched 
soccer game in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 Local ratings for the "Three Tenors" concert, meanwhile, weren't as big as the 
soccer championship but viewers' gratitude was: Both KCET-TV Channel 28 in Los 
Angeles and KOCE-TV Channel 50 in Huntington Beach earned record donation 
promises during their telecasts Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC's coverage of the World Cup showdown between Brazil and Italy averaged a 
12.4 rating in 32 markets for which ratings were available Monday. The national 
rating won't be available until Thursday, but given those overnight figures, it 
is expected to exceed the previous soccer record of 9.3 for the U.S.-Brazil 
World Cup game July 4. (By contrast, the Super Bowl last January got a 27.8, 
and last week's baseball All-Star game earned a 15.7.) 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere was the game more watched than in the market covering Los Angeles, 
Orange and Ventura counties, where it registered an 18.1 rating on KABC-TV 
Channel 7 and a 6.7 on Spanish-language KMEX-TV Channel 34 -- for a total 
viewership of more than 1.2 million homes, about 56% of all households watching 
TV between 12:30 and 3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Three Tenors" concert -- taped Saturday night at Dodger Stadium with 
performances by Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras -- was 
shown twice Sunday on both KCET and KOCE and brought the two public-television 
stations more than $588,000 in pledges from grateful viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 National ratings for the concert were not expected until today, but the 4 p.m. 
telecast on KCET was seen in about 270,000 homes, while the 7 p.m. showing 
reached about 285,000 homes. KOCE ratings were not available. 
</P>
<P>
 KCET, which had 10 pledge breaks during its two broadcasts, said it received 
$469,944 in pledges from 4,526 callers -- both records for a single day of fund 
raising, and both expected to climb as additional calls were tabulated Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The smaller KOCE raised about $118,900 and added 1,050 new members, 
spokeswoman Nancy Lambing said Monday. "This was absolutely the most we've 
ever" raised with a drive pegged to a particular program, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 KOCE will rebroadcast the show Wednesday at 8 p.m. KCET will show it again 
Aug. 20 at 8 p.m. and Aug. 21 at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Promoters wouldn't release figures, but reliable sources estimated that the 
concert itself grossed upward of $13 million. Official attendance was 56,000.

POP MUSIC; SOCIAL D(ESCENDANTS) TO TAKE A FUEL BREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While Social Distortion busies itself writing and arranging songs for its next 
album, band members Dennis Danell and John Maurer plan to take occasional 
busman's holidays this summer in an offshoot band called Fuel. The band will 
play one of its first shows tonight at Linda's Doll Hut in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is more of a hobby than anything, just for fun and to blow off steam," 
Danell said Thursday. "We can go and play a lot of places we couldn't play in 
Social D -- get back to a more underground thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Danell, who plays rhythm guitar in Social Distortion, and Maurer, who plays 
bass, share the singing and guitar playing in Fuel. Mike Rouse plays bass, and 
Paul Fox is the drummer. 
</P>
<P>
 Danell said Fuel doesn't want to invite comparisons to Social Distortion and 
won't be playing any of the parent band's material. Instead, it will play a set 
of newly minted originals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think of Fuel as more of a surf-skate band, in the punk vein. What else 
could we do?" asked Danell, who has been part of the Orange County punk scene 
since he joined Mike Ness in Social Distortion in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Danell reports that Ness is finishing the songwriting for Social Distortion's 
next album: "Mike's been coming up with interesting things. He's taking his 
time, but it's good." 
</P>
<P>
 When the songs are ready, the band plans to record with producer Michael 
Beinhorn, whose credits include the most recent albums by Soundgarden and Soul 
Asylum. The fourth Social Distortion member, drummer Christopher Reece, has 
taken on a side project of his own: managing the Orange County band Joyride. 
</P>
<P>
 Danell said that Social Distortion will emerge in August for its first live 
shows since September. Gigs will include a festival bill in Hawaii and a West 
Coast club tour, "just to try new material and get out and play again." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How active Fuel will be "depends what happens with Social D. That's the main 
priority," Danell said. SD has been doing preliminary work for its album at the 
Fullerton studio formerly known as the Casbah. The band acquired the studio and 
reoutfitted it for woodshedding purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, SD had either recorded or done preparatory work for all its 
albums at the Casbah with producer Chaz Ramirez, who owned the studio until his 
death in an accidental fall in December, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been in there for a good six months now," Danell said. "Fuel evolved 
out of sitting around the studio, working on stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 * Fuel and Sister Goddam (with Tony Montana of the Adolescents) play tonight 
at Linda's Doll Hut, 107 S. Adams St., Anaheim. 10 p.m. $3. (714) 533-1286.

 The results represent the first profit in two years for the company, which 
manufactures gallium-arsenide semiconductors for computing and other 
uses.Vitesse, which has struggled with the decline of the supercomputer market, 
attributed the profit to growth in the company's communications business -- new 
customers include AT & T and Intel Corp. -- and recent cost-reduction measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue in the third quarter totaled $9.2 million, a 31% increase over the $7 
million in the year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the return to profitability, the company reported a net loss of $4.3 
million on revenue of $25.9 million for the first nine months of fiscal 1994. 
During the same period a year ago, the company reported a net loss of $15.9 
million on revenue of $18.4 million.

THE NOVELTY MAY BE WEARING OFF FOR IWERKS; MULTIMEDIA: VIRTUAL-REALITY 
INNOVATOR WAS A HOT COMMODITY ON WALL STREET IN THE FALL. BUT LAST QUARTER, ITS 
STOCK WAS THE WORST PERFORMER IN THE REGION.

<P>
 Iwerks Entertainment Inc. has always aimed to thrill, but lately the firm's 
investors could do with a little less excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lost my sense of humor -- almost," said Keith Benjamin, an analyst at 
San Francisco-based Robertson Stephens & Co., which underwrote Iwerks' 
$44-million public stock offering last October. 
</P>
<P>
 The offering was one of last year's hottest. Iwerks stock went public at $18 
per share, then rocketed to $37 in a few weeks. But since then, the price has 
plunged 84%, and the stock closed Monday at $5.75 per share. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded by two former Walt Disney Co. executives -- Iwerks CEO Stan Kinsey, 
40, and co-chairman Don Iwerks -- Iwerks makes a variety of virtual-reality 
rides and theaters. At first, Wall Street found the combination of a Disney 
pedigree and virtual reality irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
 But that same novelty may also explain Iwerks' dizzying descent. The company 
has run into problems finding investors for its new Cinetropolis complexes. 
These are so-called "theme-parks-in-a-box," which offer Iwerks attractions such 
as theaters with moving seats and dance floors surrounded by 360-degree movie 
screens. 
</P>
<P>
 Iwerks had high hopes for the concept, but so far, only two deals to build 
them have been finalized. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't help when Iwerks said it expects to post a loss for its June 
quarter. In its third quarter ended March 31, Iwerks lost $891,918, compared to 
a profit of $2.31 million in the same period a year earlier, while revenue in 
the quarter fell 11% to $10 million from $11.2 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 When Iwerks went public, it offered one of the few opportunities for investors 
to get in on the supposed trend toward virtual-reality attractions, said John 
Taylor, analyst for L. H. Alton & Co. of San Francisco, an investment banking 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Taylor said, investors are more skeptical: Some form of virtual reality 
may indeed be what consumers are looking for, but "what the right recipe is, I 
don't think anyone knows yet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Iwerks said new casinos springing up in the Mississippi River region were 
expected to be major buyers of Cinetropolises. But several would-be customers 
had trouble getting permits or encountered other regulatory snags, said Deborah 
Miao, Iwerks' chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, unexpected costs cropped up in the development of other 
projects, including a new giant-screen theater at Zion National Park in Utah. 
There were also delays in the installation of a new Virtual Adventures game at 
the National Maritime Museum in Norfolk, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Iwerks' management acknowledges mistakes. Finding locations for Cinetropolises 
has been tougher than expected; so has finding people willing to put up the 
estimated $18 million per complex it takes to build one, Iwerks' Miao said. And 
the first Cinetropolis, which opened in the Foxwoods casino in Ledyard, Conn., 
has not brought hoped-for revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cinetropolis there is popular, Miao said. But in its haste to demonstrate 
the Cinetropolis concept, Iwerks accepted a deal that allowed the casino 
operator to use the theater space for its own live shows during peak hours, 
thus saving on fees it would otherwise pay to Iwerks for films and software. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts, who were touting the stock a few months ago, now say that Iwerks has 
suffered the same fate as other start-up high-tech and biotechnology firms. All 
are trendy stocks that haven't fared well recently. "No one is willing to give 
them (Iwerks) the benefit of the doubt today," said Benjamin, the Robertson 
Stephens' analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite recent stumbles, Iwerks' core business -- developing rides and 
software for theme parks, such as those run by Paramount Parks and Six Flags -- 
can still make the company attractive to investors, Benjamin argued. 
</P>
<P>
 About half Iwerks' sales last year were overseas, especially Asia. Its second 
Cinetropolis theater complex is scheduled to open in Chiryu, Japan, in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the company's efforts to sell giant-screen movie theaters has been 
successful, Benjamin said. It has emerged as a strong competitor to Imax 
Systems Corp., its chief rival in that market. 
</P>
<P>
 Iwerks also has the advantage of being a well-established leader in 
virtual-reality entertainment, Benjamin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, though, are skeptical that out-of-home, multimedia attractions such as 
those made by Iwerks will ever live up to early expectations on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The virtual-reality craze was "a one-time shot . . . Maybe the novelty has 
worn off," Robert Mescal of the Institute of Econometric Research said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who think so are investors, not consumers, retorts Iwerks chief 
executive Kinsey, who co-founded the company in 1986. Iwerks' new 
flight-simulation ride at the Six Flags Great Adventure amusement park in New 
Jersey has drawn big crowds, comparable to those at the park's best roller 
coaster, according to George Ladyman, a Six Flags vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 In the long term, the expansion of Cinetropolis still makes sense, Kinsey 
contended. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea will soon gain momentum, and the company still has $30 million in 
cash to develop it and other attractions, he said, adding: "I never got that 
excited about the stock price going up in the first place. I know winning on 
Wall Street is never that easy."

AREA'S CABLE-DELIVERED COMPUTER SERVICE FAILING TO GET ITS MESSAGE OUT; 
INFORMATION: IN THE ANTELOPE VALLEY, ONLY NINE OUT OF 63,000 CABLE HOUSEHOLDS 
SUBSCRIBE TO INGENIUS, WHICH CHARGES ONLY A START-UP FEE. LAX MARKETING AND 
TECHNICAL SHORTCOMINGS ARE BLAMED. 
</P>

<P>
 When Antelope Valley residents received a flyer in the mail recently for a 
national service that sends up-to-the-minute news, financial and sports data 
direct to their home or office computers via cable TV lines, two conclusions 
would have been natural. 
</P>
<P>
 First, that the service, known as Ingenius, must be the latest breakthrough on 
the information superhighway, as the cable industry tries to move beyond 
carrying just pictures. And second, that it probably is costly to use like some 
other on-line computer information providers. 
</P>
<P>
 But they'd have been wrong on both counts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingenius is not new. It has been carried nationally since 1986 and locally on 
Jones Intercable systems in the Antelope Valley and Oxnard-Port Hueneme areas 
since 1989, although it remains virtually unknown and unused by consumers. As 
for cost, the service is actually free on most cable systems that carry it, 
including Jones, after subscribers pay a $150 one-time equipment fee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an incredibly rich thing. I use it every day and have for almost 10 
years. As far as I'm concerned, it's probably the biggest bargain in the 
on-line business," marveled analyst Larry Gerbrandt of the media research firm 
Paul Kagan Associates Inc. in Carmel. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingenius, which functions as a personalized news service, offers continuous 
dispatches on national and international news from Associated Press, translated 
stories from six foreign news services, financial news and stock quotes, 
sports, entertainment and even state-by-state weather reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Gerbrandt is the exception. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the Antelope Valley, only nine people out of 63,000 cable households 
subscribe to Ingenius. The number is similarly small in Oxnard and Port 
Hueneme. Nationally, the service -- founded by TeleCommunications Inc., the 
nation's largest cable operator -- has fewer than 100,000 adult users despite 
being available to nearly 30 million households. 
</P>
<P>
 "The primary use at home is by news junkies. God, they love us. But there 
aren't enough of those guys," said Jerry Bennington, chief executive officer of 
the Denver-based Ingenius service. He said the company plans to continue the 
service but will focus more on schools, where it is claimed to be in use 
already at 18,000 of nearly 110,000 sites in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are similar services, Bennington said Ingenius is the only 
national and cable-delivered general consumer service for computers. It offers 
a glimpse of the expanded information services possible in the home market, 
where the cable and telephone industries are battling to dominate. 
</P>
<P>
 Analyst Gerbrandt said Ingenius' tiny customer base is a testament to the 
cable industry's failure thus far to effectively promote non-video services or 
to appeal to small, specialized audiences. "The industry doesn't know how to 
sell something that isn't a video service," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials and others in the cable industry, however, maintain Ingenius 
has suffered in part because it arrived in the mid-1980s before the explosive 
growth in the home computer market, and later because of marketing kinks and 
consumer unfamiliarity with the cable-computer combination. 
</P>
<P>
 Formerly known as X*Press Information Services Ltd., the company was founded 
in 1985 by a partnership of TCI, McGraw-Hill Inc. and a third firm, and at 
first relied on TCI systems as its clients. Ingenius' current owner is Liberty 
Media Corp., a TCI offshoot based in nearby Englewood, Colo., that TCI has 
proposed to reacquire. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberty Media, a publicly held cable systems concern, does not report separate 
results for Ingenius. But after long losing money, Bennington, without offering 
details, said the information service today is self-supporting. 
</P>
<P>
 For the $150 start-up price, users buy from the company a small converter box, 
computer software and connectors. The data feed arrives over the same cable 
lines that carry television signals. The data goes through the converter box 
and a serial cable into PC-compatible or Macintosh computers. 
</P>
<P>
 There, only the categories of information selected by the user (down to levels 
such as Washington news and college football) are on the consumers' computer 
where they are available for viewing and printing. 
</P>
<P>
 The service also lets the user designate names or keywords so that the 
software will automatically collect and save all stories with those entries. 
For stock prices, the system can track and visually graph daily results. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are disadvantages that Bennington and others say have contributed to 
Ingenius' relative obscurity. Although the information feed is continuous, 
consumers can only capture it when their computers are left turned on, which 
some people are reluctant to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the service is not interactive, meaning that users can only tap into and 
save the data that arrives, but not ask the system to provide specific 
information. And, unlike the much better-known dial-up on-line services, such 
as Prodigy, Ingenius has no electronic mail or discussion group capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Marketing also has been a problem. Bennington said cable systems have not 
pitched the service to their customers. Because it is often included in the 
basic cable package, companies get no extra revenue from it. Cable operators, 
on the other hand, say Ingenius has done little to help them market it. 
</P>
<P>
 While Ingenius says it has fewer than 100,000 non-school users, one industry 
estimate put the number at 60,000. The two biggest dial-up services, CompuServe 
and Prodigy, have about 2 million and 1.3 million subscribers, respectively, 
says the Information & Interactive Services Report. 
</P>
<P>
 Both rival services offer a broader array of information than Ingenius, but 
less daily news content. CompuServe also charges a $49.95 initial fee, $8.95 
per month and some hourly charges for certain information. Prodigy charges 
$14.95 per month plus some hourly charges. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its small customer base, Ingenius is available nationally on systems 
that reach about half of the nation's 55 million households that have basic 
cable. Its presence in Southern California is sparser, however, and the service 
is not available in the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingenius' connections include contracts with six of the nation's 10 largest 
cable conglomerates, which pay to carry it. One of those is Englewood-based 
Jones Intercable Inc., (ranked ninth by the Kagan firm), which operates the 
Antelope Valley and Oxnard-Port Hueneme cable systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The local cable systems' small number of subscribers illustrate Ingenius' 
problems. Although Jones Intercable has carried the service since 1989, it 
remains unknown even among top officials in the area's two cities, Lancaster 
and Palmdale, and its three largest school districts until a recent Jones 
mailer mentioned it. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, it also came as a surprise to Nikki Davis, assistant superintendent 
of the Hueneme School District, which has a television and VCR in almost every 
classroom and is innovative with technology.  
</P>
<P>
 But once they heard details of it last week, local officials quickly began 
showing interest. Carol Seidl, Palmdale's cable liaison, said she wanted to see 
a hands-on demonstration. And school officials, who would pay only $120 for the 
one-time equipment fee, called the service a natural for social studies and 
current affairs classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Ingenius' weak local showing, Jeff Jones, the general manager of 
Jones' Oxnard system, worked for the company in Oregon until last year and 
recalled widespread school use there. Students used Ingenius-linked computers 
in school libraries to research their projects, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the company also offers an executive version for $21.95 per month 
that adds access to business news wires and a daily 15-minute delayed ticker 
feed on about 30,000 stocks from the major markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerbrandt and Bill Johnson, deputy chief of the Federal Communications 
Commission's cable services bureau, said the experience with Ingenius could 
help the cable industry gain a future foothold in interactive and non-video 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Ingenius must deal with consumers such as Peggy Keegan, vice 
president of public affairs for the California Cable Television Assn. Unlike 
most consumers, she's known about Ingenius for years and the service is carried 
on the cable system in Oakland where she lives. 
</P>
<P>
 But after Keegan got a home computer two years ago, she opted instead for 
America Online, the third largest dial-up service with 900,000 customers, that 
charges a minimum $9.95 per month. Today, Keegan uses America Online 
constantly, but doesn't take Ingenius.

HOME SALES NEAR BEST SHOWING IN 5 YEARS, BUT PRICES GO LOWER; REAL ESTATE: THE 
JUNE TOTAL OF 1,125 EXISTING SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSES CLOSING ESCROW IS TWO HOMES 
SHY OF FIVE-YEAR MARK SET IN MAY. MEDIAN SALES PRICE DOWN 14%.

<P>
 Sales of existing single-family homes in the San Fernando Valley last month 
were close to the best showing in five years, as escrow closures in June shot 
up 41% from the same month a year earlier. But prices continued to sink: the 
average resale price for a single-family house in the Valley last month was 
$229,800, down 14% from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley Assn. of Realtors said 1,125 single-family houses 
closed escrow last month, up from sales of 800 for the same month a year ago. 
The June total fell just two homes shy of the five-year mark set in May, helped 
by low interest rates and perhaps low asking prices because of an ample supply 
of foreclosure properties still coming to the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month the median sales price for single-family houses also slipped 14% to 
$176,000, down from $204,500 in June, 1993. The median price is the point at 
which half of the houses sold for more than $176,000 and half sold for less 
than that. 
</P>
<P>
 From May to June, the average resale price of a single-family home dipped 
another 1%, or $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley realty group said prices continue to be depressed partly because 
some homeowners or lenders are unloading quake-damaged properties, and also 
because the lingering effects of the recession continue to hinder demand. 
Though some shoppers are rushing to take advantage of low prices and interest 
rates, the market is fragile, said Jim Link, the association's executive vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any quick increase in asking price quickly would shut sales down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Condominium sales in June totaled 146, up slightly from sales of 141 the same 
month a year ago, the association said. The average resale price of a condo, 
however, dropped 22% to $119,700 last month from $152,500 a year ago. The 
median resale price last month was $112,600, down 17% from the $135,000 median 
in June of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake appeared to continue to hamper the supply of houses and condos, 
as active listings in both categories totaled 8,304 in June, down 3% from the 
previous month and down 36% from June, 1993, when 13,063 units were listed. 
</P>
<P>
 But many foreclosed properties are not included in the realty group's list of 
housing inventory for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Under normal circumstances the combination of shrinking supply of properties 
for sale and rising sales normally would translate to higher prices. But 
brokers have said repeatedly in recent months that prices could remain 
depressed until quake-damaged properties are cleared from the market and buyer 
confidence improves. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley realty group, the largest in California, has 7,800 members from 
North Hollywood to Calabasas. Its figures generally do not include sales of new 
homes. June Valley Homes Sales

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: LIVE ENTERTAINMENT INC. TO SELL RETAIL DIVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Live Entertainment Inc., a Van Nuys videocassette distributor, has agreed to 
sell its long-ailing retail division to a group of the unit's managers. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase price is $38 million, plus the assumption of the retail 
division's debt. 
</P>
<P>
 The buying group includes Ivan R. Lipton, the division's president, other 
senior managers, Jefferson Capital Group Ltd. and Daniels & Associates. The 
sale is expected to be completed in August, subject to certain conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the sale would be used to buy back some of Live's Series B 
preferred stock, which is mandatorily redeemable upon the sale of the retail 
business. The redemption price of the Series B preferred was $50.4 million as 
of June 30, and increases by $600,000 each month to a maximum of $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Live said it has had discussions with lenders who might provide the funds 
needed to buy back the remaining Series B preferred stock. The repurchase of 
all the stock is a condition of Live's previously announced agreement to merge 
with Carolco Pictures Inc., a Los Angeles movie producer.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: EMBEZZLEMENT CHARGE RENEWED AGAINST FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A second amended complaint alleging violation of federal securities laws was 
filed July 8 in U. S. District Court against With Design in Mind International 
Inc., a Woodland Hills maker of toys and novelty gift items, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 The action represents an attempt to keep alive a recently dismissed 
shareholder class-action suit that alleges securities violations stemming from 
the suspected embezzlement of $2.1 million from the company by former company 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Three former executives were ousted from the company two years ago and later 
settled a complaint brought by the company by agreeing to pay about $1 million, 
mostly in cash and stock. The former executives did not admit or deny any 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequently, two shareholders filed a class-action complaint against the 
company, seeking the right to rescind their purchases of the company's stock, 
as well as unspecified damages. The shareholder complaint had already been 
amended once when it was dismissed by the court on May 24 this year, but the 
plaintiffs were given 45 days to submit a second amended complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 In a prepared statement, the company said it "intends to continue to 
vigorously defend itself in this matter." 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which has been restructuring since late 1992, posted a loss of 
$509,922 on revenue of $294,900 for the first quarter ended March 31.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: WHEEL MAKER SUPERIOR POSTS 16% EARNINGS GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Superior Industries International Inc., a Van Nuys-based supplier of cast 
aluminum wheels for auto makers, reported net income of $15.4 million for the 
second quarter ended June 30, a 16% increase from earnings of $13.3 million for 
the same three-month period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue for the recent quarter was $121 million, up 13% from the second 
quarter of 1993, when the company reported net sales of $107 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis L. Borick, chairman and president of Superior, attributed the growth to 
a "robust" automotive economy and successful efforts to acquire a greater share 
of the cast aluminum wheel market. Superior supplies wheels to various 
companies, including Ford, General Motors and Toyota, and also makes 
accessories for the national automotive aftermarket. 
</P>
<P>
 For the six months ended June 30, the company reported earnings of $27.9 
million on sales of $227 million, compared to profit of $23.3 million on 
revenue of $205 for the same period a year ago.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: AMGEN REPORTS NET INCOME OF $107.5 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amgen Inc., a Thousand Oaks-based biotechnology company, reported net income 
of $107.5 million for the second quarter ended June 30, a 7% rise from the 
$100.2 million in profit the company reported for the same quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue in the recent quarter rose 21% to $415 million from the $343 million 
in revenue the company reported for the second quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
 For the six months ended June 30, Amgen reported net income of $200.9 million 
on revenue of $779 million, compared to the $189.5-million profit the company 
earned on revenue of $653 million for the first six months of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The company attributed much of the recent growth to the continued success of 
its two blood cell-producing drugs, Epogen and Neupogen.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: 3 OXNARD LAWYERS PICKED AS NATIONAL FINALISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SEARLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three Oxnard attorneys are among 10 national finalists for the 1994 Trial 
Lawyer of the Year Award. The award, presented by Washington, D.C.-based Trial 
Lawyers for Public Justice, is presented annually to the lawyer deemed to have 
contributed the most to the public interest through work on a precedent-setting 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the Ventura County nominees, Mark O. Hiepler and Alan R. Templeman, 
represented the estate of Hiepler's sister, Nelene Fox, in a suit against 
Health Net, a health maintenance organization based in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit charged that Health Net wrongfully refused to pay for a bone-marrow 
transplant for Hiepler's sister, a cancer victim. A jury awarded the estate a 
record $89.3 million, which was reduced in a settlement to an undisclosed 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
 The third Oxnard nominee, Lee Pliscou, was one of the attorneys who 
represented women packinghouse workers in a sex-discrimination case against 
Oxnard Lemon Co. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal judge ruled that hiring discrimination at the company was so 
clear-cut that no trial was necessary. Oxnard Lemon paid $575,000 to its female 
employees and agreed to re-structure its hiring and assignment systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiepler and Templeman were on the staff of Lowthorp Richards McMillan Miller 
Conway & Templeman. Templeman is still a partner with the firm but Hiepler has 
left and opened a new firm, Hiepler & Hiepler, along with his wife, Michelle. 
</P>
<P>
 Pliscou was with California Rural Legal Assistance. He has since left the 
agency and is "taking a round-the-world trip," an agency spokeswoman said.

 Oxnard-based Southland Sod Farms emerged a winner in the World Cup soccer 
matches at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The privately held firm delivered 137,000 square feet of Tifgreen Hybrid 
Bermuda grass that covered the playing field for games that started with an 
exhibition June 4 and culminated with Sunday's championship final. Jurgen 
Gramckow, Southland's managing general partner, said his company received 
$35,000 for the sod, which his crews installed in 15- by 48-inch sections. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally, we do residential work from builders of new housing tracts," he 
said. "This was our biggest order for a sporting event." 
</P>
<P>
 Southland has 125 employees and 1,000 acres of sod.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: PATAGONIA TO STRETCH BY 2,000% ITS USE OF RECYCLED 
MATERIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SEARLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Outdoor clothing producer Patagonia Inc. has met with such success introducing 
a fabric made with recycled plastic soda-pop bottles that the Ventura company 
plans to expand its use of the material by 2,000% in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
 Patagonia will increase the number of products made with the material, PCR 
Synchilla, to 34 this fall from only two last year, reports Lisa Wade, director 
of the firm's post-consumer recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
 The company expects to use 8 million recycled 2-liter bottles to produce some 
of the pricey sweaters, jackets and pants in this year's fall catalogue, 
compared to 400,000 bottles last year, Wade added. Mailing of the catalogue is 
due to start Aug. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentally sensitive Patagonia says Synchilla is costlier than most other 
fabrics used in the company's garments. The firm is developing the material in 
collaboration with several East Coast mills and recycling concerns, Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We aren't doing this for profit," she declared. "Our goals are to produce 
high quality products that will last a long time and also to use millions of 
pounds of plastic that otherwise would end up in landfills." 
</P>
<P>
 The PCR Synchilla sweaters introduced last year were well-received but "a bit 
coarse," Wade conceded. The fabric in those garments was 80% recycled plastic 
and 20% so-called virgin polyester. 
</P>
<P>
 Several new versions of Synchilla have been developed, containing from 50% to 
90% recycled plastic bottles. "They're softer than the fabric we used last 
year," Wade said. "We expect them to be very well received." 
</P>
<P>
 One item in the forthcoming catalogue, a cable-knit sweater, is 65% PCR 
Synchilla and 35% washable wool. It sells for $112. 
</P>
<P>
 Other garments include a hooded fleece jacket that's 90% recycled plastic and 
10% virgin polyester ($125) and an unhooded jacket that's half PCR Synchilla 
and half virgin polyester ($110). 
</P>
<P>
 Patagonia's brightly colored clothes have attracted a loyal following among 
outdoor enthusiasts. In 1992, its most recently reported year, the privately 
held firm had sales of $112 million. The company contributes 1% of its gross 
sales or 10% of net profits, whichever is larger, to environmental causes.

SHAKEN AND STIRRED; THE QUAKE JOLTED BUSINESS FOR SOME SHOPS NEAR EPICENTER, 
WHILE GIVING OTHERS A BOOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's an easy way to tell how the small businesses along one block in 
Northridge are faring six months after the earthquake ravaged the area. Just 
look at the shopkeepers' faces. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura D'Angelo is the owner of the Kids at Heart gift shop in the Northridge 
Garden Center strip mall on Reseda Boulevard, just north of the Northridge 
Meadows apartment complex, where 16 people died in the quake. But the usually 
upbeat D'Angelo -- who has done everything from hosting art fairs to adding 
trendy new items to her carefully honed line of gifts -- is showing signs of 
stress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm knocking myself out trying to survive," said D'Angelo, but her sales are 
still 20% off normal levels. "I'm in a burnout period." 
</P>
<P>
 At a strip mall down the street, dry cleaner Gianni Fontana di Trevi looks 
grim. In the past few months he has taken in just $100 a day in gross receipts, 
not enough to cover his expenses. Fontana di Trevi hasn't applied for a Small 
Business Administration loan because, with business so bad, he sees no way to 
make loan payments. "I'm thinking I'll stay another month or two to see what 
happens," he said. In the meantime, his wife's salary from an outside job pays 
the bills. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Coco's Restaurant and Bakery, next to Kids at Heart, general manager 
Nancy Hazelzet flashes a somewhat embarrassed smile as she admits that her 
restaurant business is booming, with sales up $1,000 to $2,000 a week over this 
time last year. Many regular customers have returned, she said, along with 
construction workers, geologists and architects who are working on earthquake 
rebuilding in the area. "This has become a gathering place," Hazelzet said. 
</P>
<P>
 For these small business owners in three strip malls surrounding the destroyed 
Northridge Meadows apartments, about a mile from the epicenter, the six-month 
anniversary of the earthquake holds widely diverse meanings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To some, it commemorates their will to endure as their sales slowly creep 
back. For others it's a glaring reminder of how arduous their recovery has 
been, leaving them to wonder how much longer they can hold on with sales 
sometimes less than half the usual volume. Yet others find themselves in the 
surprising position of seeing business improve even beyond pre-quake levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The businesses suffering the most tend to be those that rely on clientele from 
the immediate neighborhood. Roya Saberzadeh, owner of Rochie's Greek Row, 
specializing in clothing and memorabilia for Cal State Northridge students, is 
struggling to stay afloat; her sales are off 50%. Not only is enrollment down 
at the quake-damaged university, she said, but most of the students who usually 
continue living nearby during summer break have moved away while apartment 
buildings are rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 She is still waiting for word on her SBA loan application, so Saberzadeh 
borrows money from her father to get by. Staring down into a glass cabinet, she 
said quietly: "I'm going to owe him into the next lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Jones, owner of the Jones Coffee Co. boutique, just received word that 
her SBA loan application was approved. She doesn't know how much she'll get, 
but she hopes it will go a long way toward replenishing the $64,000 she spent 
from her savings to replace broken porcelain plates, glasses and coffee 
grinding equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a gamble for Jones, whose sales are also off by half. Her clientele 
consists mostly of local homeowners, many of whom are only now starting to 
receive insurance money and begin repairs on their homes. Jones is betting that 
her customers will be settled back in their houses and ready to buy dishes and 
decorative items during the critical Christmas buying season. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem that continues to dog local merchants is that the area still looks 
wrecked. Northridge Meadows and many other collapsed apartment buildings remain 
in a shambled state, with demolition proceeding slowly. At the Northridge 
Garden Center strip mall, half the shops are vacant, with "For Lease" signs 
posted in the windows. The mall's current owner, Phoenix Home Life Mutual 
Insurance Co. in Hartford, Conn. -- which assumed ownership in March, averting 
a foreclosure -- said that structural repairs at the mall have been completed 
and this month it will begin charging tenants rent for the first time since the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But patching, plastering and ceiling work both inside and outside the shops 
remains to be done. At one end of the mall, a gaping hole in the outside wall 
of a restaurant is large enough for a person to walk through. Nearby inside 
Giulianos delicatessen, which hasn't reopened, a large refrigerated case 
remains toppled, insulation material is piled to one side and canned goods lie 
on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to their desperation is that many merchants have been turned down for 
the SBA loans they had hoped for to help turn things around. 
</P>
<P>
 At his strip mall office, dentist Alexander Bondar sits at the reception desk, 
ready to greet the patients that never come. His examining room is empty. "I'm 
open," he said, "but I'm still closed." 
</P>
<P>
 Bondar was denied an SBA loan. So he tried to sell his practice, but there are 
no buyers. He pays his bills from his savings, and spends his time calling 
former patients. "They moved to a different area," he said. "They say they're 
scared of this area." 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Zipusch, owner of the Intrigue hair salon, whose sales are down 70%, 
said his loan request was denied because the SBA doubted he could repay the 
money. With local apartments deserted, depriving him of his former customer 
base, Zipusch said he needs the funds to help pay for advertising. The only way 
he can survive, he said, is with drastic reduction in his $2,700-a-month rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Jo-Anne Leventhal, a spokesman for Phoenix Home Life, the landlord, said that 
rents at the center would not be lowered. She added that the insurer plans to 
keep the strip mall and is marketing the empty stores to prospective tenants, 
though none have signed leases. "We're very optimistic. We think it's a good 
property." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another landlord, Bill Matthews, who manages the other two strip malls that 
his family owns in this block of Reseda Boulevard, has reduced the rent for 
many of his tenants -- despite paying an extra $900 a month in interest for 
loans he took out to cover repairs and lost income. Mostly Matthews worries 
about securing a new mortgage when $2 million in mortgage loans on the 
properties come due in December. Roger Olson, chairman of Dwyer-Curlett Inc., 
the Los Angeles mortgage-banking firm that represents the lenders on Matthews' 
strip malls, said the lenders have "every incentive to work things out. They 
don't want to foreclose." 
</P>
<P>
 Landlord Matthews also applied to the SBA for refinancing assistance, but his 
request was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Brady, a spokeswoman for the SBA disaster division, said that earthquake 
damage must be equal to at least 40% of the value of a building for the owner 
to qualify for refinancing. As for merchants whose loan requests were denied, 
she said, the SBA considers only cash flow generated before the earthquake. 
"Unfortunately, a lot of businesses are being turned down because they weren't 
making it before the quake." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Brady added, the SBA has approved 56% of the Northridge 
earthquake-related loan applications from businesses, for a total of $743 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone needs help, however. Some small businesses along this Northridge 
block have enjoyed surprisingly brisk sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Kuebler, owner of My Hero submarine sandwich shop, has seen sales 
increase 5% to 10% over pre-quake levels as longtime customers pack the lunch 
counter next to construction workers that he believes are working at CSUN. 
After 30 years in business, Kuebler said, he and his wife are "going to start 
living a little." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Cameramart International photo supply shop, owner Nubar Costantian said 
that business has improved from a year ago, when sales were off because of the 
recession. Costantian speculated that he's benefiting from other camera stores 
remaining closed and customers repairing and replacing damaged camera 
equipment. Also working in Cameramart's favor is that his customers come from 
all over the region, not just the hard-hit Northridge area. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales have also returned to normal levels at the Record Trader Outlet, where 
collectors come from miles away to search for deals among the shop's used CDs, 
records and videocassettes. "We get a lot of bargain hunters," said manager 
Russell St. Charles. "A lot of customers come in every day, or a couple times a 
week. We don't make a lot of money, but we're making money." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Caruthers, co-owner of the Exotic Fitness gym and adjacent tanning 
salon, said he's encouraged by a new marketing strategy that seems to be paying 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 He raised his gym prices -- he now charges $600 to $700 a month, compared to 
about $150 previously -- and began advertising in upscale neighborhoods such as 
Encino to attract a higher-income clientele. The change has been enough to 
return sales at the exercise boutique to near-normal, although his tanning 
salon business remains nonexistent. So Caruthers is considering converting that 
to exercise space. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And at the Northridge Sports Collectibles shop, sales are rebounding, in part 
because a new silent auction for customers to bid on sports cards has proved 
popular, said manager Bobby Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
 The store has also begun selling POGs, the colorful cardboard bottle caps that 
are the latest craze among school-age kids. World Cup soccer POGs have been hot 
sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 At gift shop Kids at Heart, POGs have also been a temporary salvation for 
owner D'Angelo: She sells the POGS for 15 cents to $2 apiece -- along with 
thicker discs called "slammers" that are used to play a tiddlywinks-type game 
with the POGs. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Angelo admits that they don't exactly fit in with her usual line of rubber 
stamps, wrapping paper, stationery and hand-painted gift items in her 
tastefully decorated store. But a sign out front advertising POGs for sale, she 
said, "is what's going to get me through the summer."

CALL GOES UP FOR SOLUTION TO ALISO SPILLS; POLLUTION: LAGUNA COUNCIL MEMBERS, 
TIRED OF SEWAGE PROBLEMS THAT HAVE CLOSED THE BEACH AT TIMES, ASK FOR HEARINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fed up with frequent sewage spills going into Aliso Creek and then polluting 
the ocean, three Laguna Beach City Council members have called for public 
hearings before a regional water board to find a solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is with the ocean water quality," Councilman Wayne L. Peterson 
said. "I do not think the agency in charge is being run in a pro-active manner 
for environmental concerns, and that's a strange statement coming from me, a 
businessman." 
</P>
<P>
 The agency Peterson criticized is the Aliso Water Management Agency, an 
umbrella for seven waste and water districts, serving mostly south Orange 
County, that all use Aliso Creek for drainage. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Peterson joined Laguna Beach Mayor Ann Christoph and Mayor Pro Tem 
Kathleen Blackburn to voice their complaints at a summit meeting for those 
districts, which cover Laguna Niguel, Lake Forest, Laguna Hills, Mission Viejo, 
part of Irvine, Laguna Beach, and unincorporated south Orange County areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our constituents are very concerned about this," Blackburn said. "We're 
concerned about the high number of people using the system and the fact that 
we're the downstream recipients of this." 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson said the problems include ocean pollution at the mouth of Aliso 
Creek, a Laguna Niguel regional waste facility in need of drainage 
alternatives, the need for more water recycling projects, and increasing the 
public's awareness to lessen urban runoff that goes from neighborhood storm 
drains to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people living south of Aliso Creek and the people who put on their 
bathing suits and go there have complained of pulling brown globs off their 
legs," Peterson said. "Can you imagine?" 
</P>
<P>
 Interest in safeguarding Aliso Creek from sewage is high; two months ago, 
Laguna Beach residents voted to increase their sewer fees to help upgrade the 
city's outdated sewer system. Blackburn also noted a 1992 citywide poll in 
which nine out of 10 residents surveyed reported ocean water quality -- and not 
crime -- as their top priority. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Becker, general manager for the seven-member, Aliso Water Management 
Agency (AWMA), said he agreed with some of Peterson's argument. 
</P>
<P>
 "AWMA needs to have its members come together and understand the technical 
reports that have been prepared and submitted to the members," Becker said. 
"Everybody needs to agree on what their future needs are and what our current 
situation is to plan for agreements to accommodate the future." 
</P>
<P>
 But Becker said AWMA already has proposals to improve the system, and he 
disagreed with Peterson's call for greater public scrutiny of AWMA's decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our meetings are already open to the public," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three council members asked the AWMA to hold public study sessions and 
said they intend to ask the influential San Diego Regional Water Quality 
Control Board, which also has jurisdiction for waste treatment facilities, to 
play a role in stopping the sewage spills into the creek. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaints come in the wake of the latest spill June 20, when a one-mile 
stretch of Aliso Beach had to be closed after 16,000 gallons of partially 
treated sewage spilled into the creek and flowed to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Water district officials say part of the problem is topography. Aliso Creek 
serves as part of a vast drainage basin from the river mouth in Laguna Beach, 
inland through cities and communities of Aliso Viejo, Leisure World, Laguna 
Hills, Mission Viejo, Lake Forest, Leisure World, incorporated areas of Orange 
County, and Portola Hills in northeast Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The creek meanders 12 miles, starting at Trabuco Canyon and dumping into the 
sea in south Laguna Beach about 100 yards north of the Aliso Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 "In addition, there are four sewage treatment facilities along the creek," 
said Mike Dunbar, South Coast Water District general manager, the agency with 
jurisdiction at the creek's mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 During winter rains, Dunbar said, the creek carries urban runoff and untreated 
waste such as fertilizers and pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent years, spills have become chronic. Local residents have 
complained about odors, mysterious hissing and bubbling noises coming from 
creek water, and illnesses such as hacking coughs, skin and rash infections, 
and hepatitis. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I go there a lot," said skim boarder Charles (Tex) Haines, 41, of Laguna 
Beach. "I like it because you can park quickly and check out the surf easily. 
But sometimes, the water there is pretty ugly, like dark brown. And, it smells 
like you know what and your instinct is that something died right around here." 
</P>
<P>
 Haines, who has a degree in biology from Stanford University, helped found the 
Laguna Beach chapter of Surfrider Foundation. When conditions are especially 
bad, Haines said, "I have a hard time believing the people who are in charge 
are doing their job." 
</P>
<P>
 Surfrider, Haines said, would like to see the creek's lagoon pumped out by the 
local waste treatment facility when it reaches excess capacity. He said 
residents successfully lobbied for a similar plan in the Northern California 
city of Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunbar acknowledged that ocean water quality at the lagoon "is of poor 
quality." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Surfriders are right," Dunbar said, "maybe we need to double our efforts 
and we're looking at that right now. Our goal is to have no more spills this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunbar added: "Hopefully the public has a mind-set now and is willing to spend 
money on projects, and draw the issue to greater scrutiny."

TEACHERS PRESSURED TO CHANGE GRADES, BREA OLINDA TRUSTEE CONTENDS; EDUCATION: 
GRADE-CHANGING SCANDAL AT HIGH SCHOOL WIDENS AS BOARD MEMBER CHARGES THAT SOME 
INSTRUCTORS WERE ASKED TO ALTER SCORES TO KEEP ATHLETES AND STUDENT GOVERNMENT 
LEADERS ELIGIBLE.

 As the investigation continued into the Brea Olinda High School grade-changing 
scandal, a school board member alleged Monday that some teachers had been 
pressured into changing student grades. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are instances that teachers were pressured from the administration to 
change grades, and I won't stand for that," trustee Todd A. Spitzer told the 
school board of the Brea Olinda Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Spitzer said he wanted to elaborate during the meeting, but other board 
members declined to second his motion to discuss the matter in public.  
</P>
<P>
 Spitzer said he believes that in some cases teachers were pressured by the 
administration to change grades of athletes and student government leaders to 
keep them eligible for those activities. He also said children of prominent 
local residents may have benefited similarly. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators would not comment on his allegations, and referred all 
questions to the Orange County Department of Education's legal counsel, whom 
they hired earlier this month to investigate the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Rachael Alcorn, the auditor who has been investigating grade-changing 
practices at the high school, confirmed Monday that student transcripts were 
altered. She said she did not know who made the changes and told trustees she 
needed more time to complete her investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcorn was appointed earlier this month following disclosure that more than 
360 student transcripts had been improperly altered by former guidance 
counselors. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of students' traditional A, B, C and D grades were changed to simple 
"pass" notations, it was revealed in June. Also, some students received double 
credit for taking the same course twice under different titles. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, school officials said there was an inequity in correcting 
original failing grades. Some students who later replaced failing grades with 
higher grades by taking the class over were still penalized by having the 
original "F" grade computed into their grade point averages. Other students, 
who replaced their failing grades, did not have the "F" grade computed into 
their grade point averages. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just one more link in the chain to show that it's true that there's 
been widespread improprieties occurring at the high school," Spitzer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea Olinda Principal John Johnson had ordered the switched grades restored 
when he learned of the situation last October. However, the grade-changing 
scandal did not publicly surface until May 20 when school board members learned 
that the Brea Olinda Teachers Assn. had filed a grievance with the state 
Commission on Teacher Credentialing. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though those records were changed, Alcorn said Monday that other records 
still must be changed. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials last month said that the transcript changes were made by 
former guidance counselors without teacher approval, a violation of the state 
education code. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Supt. Peter J. Boothroyd said the high school's current counselors 
in the last two months combed through last year's student transcripts and 
determined that none of the changes would have made athletes ineligible to play 
on school teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the grade-changing scandal is an unsigned memo dated Nov. 12, which 
outlined the problems at the high school. Supt. Edgar Z. Seal, who retired last 
week, said two weeks ago in an interview with The Times that he never received 
such a memo. He said he gets many anonymous memos but had never received one 
regarding the grade-changing issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, he sent a confidential memo to school board members, saying that 
he saw the memo last week for the first time, Spitzer said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Spitzer said he had confronted Seal about the memo at a closed session in 
June and that Seal had acknowledged reading "something in writing on the 
subject matter, but couldn't recall where." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a complete cover-up," Spitzer said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Seal told the board that he knew about the grade changes in 
January, Spitzer said. He told The Times last month that he has known about the 
grade changes since February. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal was not at Monday's board meeting and could not be reached for comment.

TEACHERS BALK AT FULL INCLUSION OF DISABLED STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A large majority of the American Federation of Teachers opposes the burgeoning 
trend of placing disabled students in regular classrooms, according to a new 
poll released Monday at the union's national convention here. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first survey of its kind, more than 75% of the AFT members said they 
would not support a policy of "full inclusion" at their schools, and nearly 60% 
do not want their schools to increase the current level of mainstreaming of 
special education students. 
</P>
<P>
 Full inclusion -- a growing national movement in which youngsters with 
learning disabilities, behavioral problems and severe physical disorders study 
alongside children who are not disabled rather than in segregated classrooms -- 
has emerged as one of AFT's top concerns over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders say teachers are not trained to deal with disabled youngsters, 
that discipline is difficult in mainstreamed classes, and that full inclusion 
threatens the safety of students and staff. 
</P>
<P>
 These issues were highlighted this spring by an Orange County case in which 
the Ocean View School District struggled over the placement of a 6-year-old 
kindergartner with a communications disorder, ultimately going to court to try 
to oust the child. 
</P>
<P>
 Though a judge returned the boy, Jimmy Peters, to his mainstreamed classroom 
in Huntington Beach, the controversy continues because Jimmy's father has 
refused to place his son in a special education class, but school officials and 
other parents say he is disruptive and violent when in the mainstream 
kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone would agree that children who are violent and are dangerous should 
not be in the regular education classroom," Marcia Reback, chairwoman of AFT's 
task force on special education, said as she discussed the Peters case and the 
poll results. "Where the disagreement arises is over disruption: How much 
disruption should teachers and children have to tolerate? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The lack of a hurricane in your environment is important when you're trying 
to teach and trying to learn -- unless you're a meteorologist," Reback said, 
adding "It's wrong, it's wrong . . . not all kids fit the same mold." 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 5 million special education students nationwide. In 1990-91, 
the most recent year for which data is available, about a third of those 
students spent at least 80% of their time in regular classes, and 35% spent 
between 20% and 80% of their day there. In Orange County, 26% of the 36,000 
special needs students are mainstreamed full time, and another 45% spend more 
than half their day in regular classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The AFT, which represents 852,000 people nationwide, has called for a 
moratorium on full inclusion policies. Union members are expected to pass a 
more detailed resolution opposing full inclusion today during the closing day 
of the AFT's 73rd national convention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both special education and regular education students appear to be the 
victims of lofty ideals and poor policy," AFT President Albert Shanker said in 
a statement Monday. "It's unfortunate that school systems are jumping on a 
bandwagon that is headed in the wrong direction and bound to impede student 
achievement." 
</P>
<P>
 Conducted by an independent research firm, the telephone poll of 400 AFT 
members who work in schools with full inclusion programs was conducted June 28 
through July 1. Most of those polled were ages 40 to 54 and had worked more 
than 15 years in the education field. About 46% of those polled said they work 
in urban school districts, and 31% work in the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers in the survey complained that they cannot devote enough time to all 
their students when a disabled youngster is in the classroom, that the 
mainstreamed children require special services they are neither trained nor 
equipped to provide, and that inclusion makes discipline more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Teachers express a lot of support for the social benefits of inclusion but 
they have a lot of concerns about the educational effects," said Geoffrey Ganh, 
president of the Washington-based firm that conducted the poll. "They have a 
lot of very practical concerns of how it's operating in the real world and 
because of those concerns they don't want to see it expanded." 
</P>
<P>
 The poll showed that teachers have an average of 24.4 students, including 3.7 
children with special needs, in their mainstreamed classes.  
</P>
<P>
 Only 22% of those surveyed said they received training to teach the disabled 
youngsters in their classes. Of those who did not, 50% said they should have 
received such training. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 60% of teachers said they are "unable to devote enough time to 
special education students," and 47% said mainstreaming makes it "difficult to 
devote enough time and attention to other" children. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding discipline, 46% said inclusion has made it tougher while 45% said 
they see no difference, and 37% said their school's rules for disciplining 
special needs students "do not work that well." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, most of those surveyed expressed some uncertainty. More than half said 
they "have mixed feelings" about their school's inclusion policy, and 46% said 
they believe inclusion has had a "mixed impact" on meeting the needs of special 
education students and of other students.

BOOT CAMP ON THE BEACH; YOUTHS ENDURE SUMMER OF PUSH-UPS, JELLYFISH STINGS TO 
BE JUNIOR LIFEGUARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TAMMY HYUNJOO KRESTA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sixteen-year-old Jessica Roberts has devoted four summers of her life to the 
beach, the waves -- and the push-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts is among 850 local youths who are in the city's eight-week junior 
lifeguard program, which teaches aspiring lifeguards about first aid, ocean 
currents and the most important lesson of all: discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 Discipline here comes in the form of push-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can almost say that it's a semi-military program," said program 
coordinator David Simcox, 48, who believes that strict training is a precursor 
to water safety. "We've never had a water-related accident in 31 years." 
</P>
<P>
 The students quickly learn to address their instructors as "sir" and "ma'am." 
And never, never to say, "Yeah." 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably the biggest discipline is you can't say 'Yeah,' " Roberts said.  
</P>
<P>
 The penalty is push-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first week, rule breakers must drop and do 10 of the motivating 
exercises, 20 for infractions in the second week, 30 in the third and, for the 
truly slow learners, as many as 80 by the eighth week. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the grueling six-mile runs, mile-long ocean swims, classroom 
instruction and push-up training, about half of the students return every year. 
Most of the summer campers, who range in age from 9 to 17, want to become 
lifeguards.  
</P>
<P>
 Apparently it is good training; about half of the lifeguards on Huntington 
Beach are veterans of the city's junior lifeguard camp and another 20% went to 
similar camps elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday morning, 150 12- and 13-year-olds in red swim trunks and surf 
caps took their morning swim around the Huntington Beach Pier, forcing anglers 
to temporarily pull in their lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts of Huntington Beach was one of about a dozen veteran campers who 
assisted younger swimmers during the exercise. She guided them using a yellow 
buoy and had to help two victims of jellyfish stings back to shore. 
</P>
<P>
 "You take (what you learn here) with you wherever you go," said Roberts, who 
was promoted to "safety aide" this year after three years of training. 
</P>
<P>
 She is among a handful of students who, because they have shown exceptional 
leadership skills and a desire to become lifeguards, earn that title or the 
highest designation of captain. Captains receive specific lifeguard training 
while working on the beach with full-time lifeguards. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which costs $160 for 40 four-hour sessions, began in 1964 with 35 
boys. Today, a little more than half are boys, and the number of girls has 
grown every year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no separation of physical activities," Simcox said. "In fact, a lot 
of our girls are stronger and more physically fit" than the boys. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the campers move into the oldest group of 14- to 17-year-olds they 
have learned many of the skills needed to be a lifeguard, said Tom Denny, who 
is one of the 18 instructors. 
</P>
<P>
 All the youths who graduate this summer will earn the title of junior 
lifeguard. Some may earn a second- or first-lieutenant badge and a few will 
become safety aides or captains. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of fun 'cause I'd just be at home watching TV until 12 if I wasn't 
here," said Angela Neill, 12, of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Amanda Weeks remembers being scared during her first swim around the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 "You say, 'Well, that would be cool if you could learn how to control yourself 
and not go hysterical,' " said Weeks, 12, of Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 For many program graduates, these lessons of endurance and respect are 
hard-won. Still, they manage to make the most of their youthful spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six-mile runs and pier swims turn out to be fun somehow," Roberts said.

POLICE SHOWED RESTRAINT ON JULY 4, CHIEF SAYS ; LAW ENFORCEMENT: RONALD L. 
LOWENBERG TELLS THE CITY COUNCIL HE IS PROUD OF THE WAY HIS OFFICERS BEHAVED 
DURING NEAR-RIOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Responding to allegations that baton-wielding police used excessive force to 
control Fourth of July crowds, Police Chief Ronald L. Lowenberg told the City 
Council Monday that officers showed "great restraint" as they were pelted with 
rocks, bottles and lighted fireworks.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tough situation, and we probably made mistakes," Lowenberg said. 
"But I think our people did an outstanding job. But there's always room for 
improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, "I am proud to be the leader of this caliber of employees." 
</P>
<P>
 The chief said holiday revelry turned into a near-riot as furniture was burned 
in the streets, illegal fireworks were set off and objects were thrown at the 
officers.  
</P>
<P>
 Sixty-five of the 117 arrested were Huntington Beach residents, and 78 of them 
were over 21, he told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 They were arrested on a myriad of charges, including drinking in public, 
public intoxication, failure to disperse and discharging fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents have criticized police who, they said, stormed downtown in riot 
gear. The critics charged that officers took a strong-arm approach to breaking 
up the crowds and struck bystanders with clubs. Police drove a 2,500-gallon 
water truck down Main Street and hosed revelers to disperse them. Witnesses 
also claimed that police failed to warn the crowds to clear the streets.  
</P>
<P>
 But Lowenberg said Monday night that police gave numerous announcements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who says they didn't hear dispersal orders, I don't understand that," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowenberg also said his officers followed Police Department training and state 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did it by the books," he said. "There was no acting out by police. I'm 
very proud of our department."  
</P>
<P>
 Lowenberg said that six people so far have filed formal complaints with the 
Police Department. Considering the number of arrests, he said, "the six 
complaints in my opinion is not a significant number." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "I don't want to minimize the complaints. To the six people who 
filed them, they're obviously serious to them, and they're serious to us."  
</P>
<P>
 He said his department will investigate the complaints, and he suggested that 
anyone who is not comfortable complaining to the Police Department about its 
officers' actions file a complaint with the Orange County Human Relations 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Monday, no claims against the city have been filed with the city clerk's 
office, he said, although those filing grievances have six months from July 4 
to do so. About six people have taken out claim forms. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who have complained about police use of force on July 4 is Allie 
Gonsowski, 17, of Huntington Beach, who said that an officer swung a club at 
her, striking her across the face. She suffered a fractured jaw and her teeth 
were loosened. One was knocked out.  
</P>
<P>
 Jim King, 19, of Midway City said he was hit twice with a baton, resulting in 
a cut to the left side of his face that required stitches.  
</P>
<P>
 Neither Gonsowski nor King were arrested, and neither has filed a complaint, 
although their attorneys have contacted Lowenberg's office, the chief said. He 
encouraged them to file complaints, so the Police Department can investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Linda Moulton-Patterson said she supported police efforts and that it 
was a "very difficult situation." She added that the 1993 Fourth of July events 
ended in more violence and property destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ralph Bauer, who was downtown with police from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m., 
said: "This is a family town. If thugs want to come to this town and act up, 
they're going to have to pay the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 "My hat's off to you, chief. We're going to enforce the law," said Terry 
Britt, who has lived downtown for 11 years. He said he thinks the police acted 
professionally in controlling a potentially dangerous situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I, like many other residents, don't want to take it anymore," Britt said. " 
</P>
<P>
 Lowenberg is expected to submit a more thorough report to the council in few 
weeks. He also said he plans to meet with downtown residents once that report 
is complete.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / NORTH: ANAHEIM; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER ANTI-SMOKING RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council today will consider further restrictions on smoking in public 
places, including a ban at the Anaheim Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Irv Pickler wants the council to tighten smoking regulations so 
they more closely match a 1993 county smoking ban.For example, while Anaheim 
allows smoking in film theater lobbies and in privately rented areas and 
concourses in public buildings, the county does not. The county law applies 
only to county facilities and unincorporated areas, such as Sunset Beach and 
North Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 "The less smoking and secondhand smoke there is, the better," Pickler said. "I 
want that ordinance to be as tough as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Jack White warned council members in a city staff report that 
tighter restrictions on smoking may eventually cost the city much-needed 
revenue. Some conventioneers may refuse to visit Anaheim if smoking is 
regulated further, White said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the council unanimously imposed a ban on smoking in all city-owned 
facilities. Included in that ban is The Pond of Anaheim and the seating area at 
Anaheim Stadium.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / CENTRAL: WESTMINSTER; CITY PLANS TO ADOPT TATTOO PARLOR 
RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has tentatively approved an ordinance regulating tattoo 
parlors, though none are currently located within the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In unanimously approving the ordinance last week, council members said the law 
must be on the books in case someone wants to set up a tattoo parlor, which the 
city can regulate but not prohibit outright. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will consider the ordinance for final approval July 26. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we'll have a little bit more say on how the business will be conducted," 
said Planning and Building Director Mike Bouvier, who noted that he received 
inquiries earlier this year from people interested in opening tattoo parlors. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance defines a tattoo parlor as a facility where customers receive 
permanent marks or coloring to their skin by the use of a needle or apparatus 
as body decoration or adornment. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance would regulate both tattoo parlors and tattoo artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the ordinance, a tattoo parlor will be charged an annual license tax of 
$125 for one tattooing station. Each additional station will cost $62.50. 
Tattoo artists will have to pay a $50 annual permit fee to be allowed to ply 
their trade. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance also requires that the parlor operator secure a police permit 
and approval from the Orange County Health Care Agency before opening the 
business. Hours of operation for any tattoo parlor will be from 9 a.m. to 9 
p.m. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / NORTH: ANAHEIM; CITY TO KEEP CHARTER PROPOSAL OFF BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has rejected putting on the November ballot a proposal 
regarding how vacancies on the council should be filled. 
</P>
<P>
 The split decision prompted one councilman to charge his colleagues with 
playing political games. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 3 to 2 last week to keep the proposed city charter amendment 
off the ballot. Councilmen Bob D. Simpson and Fred Hunter voted against the 
motion, which also called for the formation of a citizen committee to review 
the city charter after the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex proposal would have automatically given a losing council candidate 
with the next-highest vote in a general election the right to a council seat in 
the event an incumbent council member is elected mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 City law now calls for an appointment by the council or a special election to 
select a new council member in the event of such a vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than save the taxpayers $100,000, they are playing politics," Hunter 
said. "This is just stupid. The (proposed amendments) would pass 
overwhelmingly." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Daly, who voted down the proposed changes, said the current city 
charter has served the city "pretty well" since its last major overhaul in the 
early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Elections and appointments are by their very nature political," Daly said.

superintendent should have, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Community members who wish to respond may attend special meetings on Thursday, 
call the district with comments or request a questionnaire, district 
spokeswoman Diane Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 People who want to meet with the district's search consultant, Richard

 The search is expected to take about four months, with potential candidates 
being interviewed about mid-October and a new superintendent being chosen by 
the end of October, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Education will fill the vacancy left by Rudy Castruita, who left

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / COSTA MESA / NEWPORT / IRVINE: IRVINE; COUNCIL OKS PLAN 
FOR 4,000 HOMES

<P>
 The City Council has given final approval to an Irvine Co. plan to build up to 
4,000 homes and two golf courses on land near Irvine Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, known as the Oakcreek village, generated little public 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents who lived around the proposed development praised the plan 
because it calls for the construction of new parks. 
</P>
<P>
 The village will be built on agricultural land bounded by Jeffrey Road, Sand 
Canyon Avenue, the Santa Ana Freeway and the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Two 18-hole golf courses will be constructed at the northern edge of the 
village along with a community park and some industrial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the housing units will be built at the southern end of the development 
near the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's unanimous approval of the final plan came at last week's 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 At previous council meetings, golfers from around the city praised the project 
for bringing two new courses to the "flatlands" area of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials and representatives from the Irvine Co. are now discussing 
whether the company will help fund design work for an underpass at Jeffrey Road 
near the Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has long sought to build the underpass, which is expected to cost $28 
million. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / SADDLEBACK / SOUTH BEACH: LAGUNA BEACH; OFFICIALS TO 
EXPLAIN CANYON ROAD PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City residents can learn more about a controversial plan to widen and realign 
Laguna Canyon Road when Orange County officials explain the options being 
considered at the City Council meeting tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Halprin, a landscape architect hired to design the Laguna Coast 
Wilderness Park, will also discuss how changes in the road would affect the 
parkland at the city's edge. 
</P>
<P>
 The area under consideration involves a 4.6-mile stretch of highway from 
approximately El Toro Road to the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 A "preferred alternative" calls for the two- to three-lane highway to be 
widened to four lanes and shifted several hundred yards west of its current 
location. 
</P>
<P>
 Other possibilities include widening the road to four lanes while maintaining 
the current alignment, and expanding the road to six lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 The various options were debated by a 17-member committee in closed-door 
meetings last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal to shift the road to the west won favor partly because that plan 
would separate the highway from three natural lakes at its edges, allowing the 
waterways to be returned to a more natural state. 
</P>
<P>
 The curvy highway, the site of multiple automobile accidents, has been the 
source of much friction over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 County and California Department of Transportation officials have long wanted 
to widen the road while the city of Laguna Beach has been protective of bucolic 
passageway, wanting to maintain its rural ambience. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the minority opposition to the favored plan was voiced by City 
Council members Lida Lenney and Robert F. Gentry. 
</P>
<P>
 Maps of the various alternatives will be in display at City Hall at 5:30 p.m. 
The county's presentation will begin at 6 p.m., followed by Halprin's 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents will then be invited to express their viewpoints. LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / COUNTYWIDE: FOOD BANK BOOSTED BY CORPORATE DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Food Distribution Center usually relies on manufacturer mistakes to help 
feed some of the estimated 400,000 Orange County residents who face hunger each 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, the food bank's directors asked company employees to give on 
their own by launching the first corporate food drive in the center's 11-year 
history. About 36,000 pounds of food have come in since June 1, and the center 
anticipates reaching 50,000 when some large corporations hold drives in July 
and August. 
</P>
<P>
 Food from the drive will make about 72,000 meals and raise awareness of hunger 
in wealthy Orange County, center officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is much more successful than what we had envisioned," said David G. 
Coffaro, chairman of the corporate drive. "About 25,000 employees had the 
chance to participate and now another 25,000 people in the county are aware of 
the issue." About 50 companies, most of them new to food drives, participated, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The charitable agencies that distribute the food reach about 180,000 people a 
month, said Fred Pratt, the center's director. But the need is far from solved. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wouldn't expect that 16% of the population in Orange County is at risk of 
going to bed hungry," said Dan Harney, executive director of the food bank. 
"That should be totally unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 The overall affluence of the county masks much of the want, but studies have 
pinpointed many pockets of poverty, Harney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's statistics show that children make up 42% of the county's hungry 
and another 18% are senior citizens. "You've got to get away from the image of 
the homeless and the lazy guy who won't work," Harney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center opened in 1983 in one room of a warehouse on Almond Avenue in 
Orange and distributed about $50,000 worth of food to charitable agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Pratt can lead a tour of a facility that spreads over two floors and 
includes two refrigerated rooms, a walk-in freezer, stack after stack of cans, 
boxes and jars and a virtual mountain of disposable diapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of volunteers help process about $13 million worth of food and other 
items a year. If they were employees, the payroll would be about $1 million 
annually, Pratt said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a member of the national Second Harvest Network, the center receives 
truckloads of manufacturer overproductions and discards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ninety-nine percent of what we do is because somebody goofed," Pratt said. 
</P>
<P>
 When an operator at Laura Scudders pulled the wrong lever, Orange County got 
20,000 pounds of cashew-filled peanut butter. And when a toy packed in Cap'n 
Crunch cereal turned out to be dangerous, 23,000 pounds of the cereal -- 39 
truckloads -- came into the Almond Avenue warehouse. Volunteers still are 
opening the bags, pulling out the toys and resealing the bags. 
</P>
<P>
 It is tedious work but well worth it, said Anaheim Hills resident Becky Swank, 
who volunteers at the bank twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably the hardest part is making yourself come down and do it," she said. 
"But once you're here, you get a second wind. It's something to give back. I've 
been blessed, and I feel that our county has gotten away from that: giving back 
to people."LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / NORTHWEST: HUNTINGTON BEACH; BALLOT TO BE FINAL OK FOR 
SOME PROJECTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Proposed beach or park projects will be placed on the ballot only after they 
have received all city approvals, the City Council has decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters in 1990 overwhelmingly passed Measure C, which gives people the right 
to vote on construction proposed on beach or park land. 
</P>
<P>
 But the measure left unclear at what stage a project should be put to a vote 
of the people, whether it should be advisory on a project's master plan or a 
final vote on an approved project. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Hagan, community services director, said a council subcommittee determined 
that Measure C intended the latter. "Once council approves a project, it then 
requires a vote of the people to do the project," Hagan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman David Sullivan, one of the authors of the measure, said voters 
should know exactly what the final project would be. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jim Silva cast the only vote against the policy, saying that 
nonprofit groups would not be able to raise the money needed to go through the 
city approval process for their projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a clear vote against youth sports," Silva said, referring to a proposed 
youth sports complex at Central Park that will fall under Measure C criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Victor Leipzig and Earle Robitaille were absent from the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people have expressed concern that it is both costly and risky to go 
through the extensive planning, environmental and design processes for a 
project that ultimately might be rejected by voters. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hagan said that projects affected by Measure C could be presented to 
residents in an informal poll included in their water bills before they go 
through the extensive city approval process. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / NORTHWEST: CYPRESS; RECREATION FEES ARE BEING RAISED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fees for many city-sponsored recreational activities will go up Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 In a unanimous vote, the City Council last week approved a schedule of higher 
fees for activities ranging from softball teams to youth arts-and-crafts 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin C. DeCarlo, director of the recreation and park district, told the 
council that fees had not been increased for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Recreation and Community Services Commission, at its June meeting, 
unanimously recommended approval for fee increases," DeCarlo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, most of these fees have an approximate 10% increase, although some 
(activities) have no increase," DeCarlo added. "Each activity and class was 
evaluated on an individual basis (for a fee increase)." 
</P>
<P>
 The increase will affect the fees for adult softball teams, which rise from 
$380 to $420; volleyball teams, from $110 to $125, and basketball teams, from 
$350 to $385. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, youth basketball will increase from $25 to $40; Pee-Wee clinics from $22 
to $25; youth arts-and-crafts from $33 to $36; drill team from $20 to $22; 
kids' music classes from $29 to $30; youth tennis from $24 to $26, and swimming 
lessons from $30 to $32. 
</P>
<P>
 Summer full-day camp and day care fees will rise from $100 to $115. The child 
instruction program Kids Corner for 3-year-olds will increase from $87 to $96, 
for 4-year-olds from $130 to $143, and the summer-only program from $80 to 
$88.BILL BILLITER

EXECUTIVE CHOSEN TO MANAGE OPTIMA'S $400-MILLION BUDGET; REFORM: DESIGNERS OF 
EMERGING SYSTEM HOPE TO IMPROVE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY TO 275,000 MEDI-CAL 
ENROLLEES. NEW OFFICER HAS ACCOUNTING BACKGROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A San Diego health care executive has been chosen chief financial officer of 
an emerging system to improve delivery of health care to Orange County's 
275,000 Medi-Cal recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 The $130,000-a-year post will be filled by P. Victor Gonzalez, formerly chief 
financial officer of Community Health Group, a health maintenance organization 
serving 40,000 Medi-Cal enrollees in San Diego, officials of the new Orange 
County program said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez is expected to play a key role in OPTIMA, a community-based 
organization that is hoped to make Medi-Cal more cost-effective and responsive 
to local needs in Orange County than the traditional state-run system. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary K. Dewane, chief executive officer of OPTIMA, said Gonzalez is a 
certified public accountant with more than 20 years experience in fiscal 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his tasks will be to help OPTIMA manage its huge projected annual 
budget, starting at $400 million and perhaps growing to $600 million.  
</P>
<P>
 "We look forward to Mr. Gonzalez providing invaluable financial management and 
planning to OPTIMA as it prepares to begin operation in mid-1995," said John R. 
Cochran, chief executive officer of Martin Luther Hospital in Anaheim and 
chairman of the OPTIMA board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran said the immense complexity of redesigning a Medi-Cal delivery system 
and an unexpected swelling of the county's Medi-Cal program, due in part to 
growing unemployment, have pushed back the projected starting date for OPTIMA, 
which was once tentatively scheduled to begin in January.  
</P>
<P>
 The next step, Cochran said, is for OPTIMA's designers to develop a budget and 
staffing plan for the program, which then must be submitted to state and 
federal authorities for approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of employees who will be hired to administer OPTIMA, Cochran and 
Dewane said, will range between 250 and 600, depending on what system of health 
care is ultimately adopted. Today the OPTIMA board of directors will meet to 
begin studying the options presented by its staff, which range from reimbursing 
physicians for each patient visit to paying health organizations a flat monthly 
rate for providing a full range of medical services for the patients they 
enroll.

MAN STABBED IN SPAT OVER CAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An argument over a pet cat landed one man in the hospital with a stab wound 
and another in jail Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police and neighbors, the argument began when James E. Odell's 
cat got under a neighbor's car in the mobile home park where the two live in 
the 14000 block of Hoover Street. 
</P>
<P>
 During the fight, according to Sgt. Tom Pixler of the Westminster Police 
Department, a neighbor, Gerard Whalen, stabbed Odell with a pocketknife. 
</P>
<P>
 Whalen, 37, was arrested and taken to the Orange County Jail where he was 
booked on suspicion of attempted murder, Pixler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Odell, 28, was in stable condition at UCI Medical Center with a knife wound in 
the abdomen.

ONLY 10 SHOW TO PERUSE CLAS TEST IN COSTA MESA; EDUCATION: RESPONSE IS SLOW 
ACROSS THE STATE AS NEW VERSIONS OF THE CONTROVERSIAL STUDENT-ASSESSMENT EXAMS 
ARE SHOWCASED. THE SAMPLES ARE ON DISPLAY FOR A MONTH.

 A firefighter, a retired statistician, a man who designs educational software 
and three mothers of elementary schoolchildren were among the first to see the 
state's controversial standardized tests Monday at the Orange County Department 
of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 "I support the state's effort to have critical thinking incorporated into the 
curriculum, but there seems to be an increasingly anti-family flavor," said 
John Price, a father of two from San Clemente who works at the Anaheim Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here because I have to figure out if I need to take a second job to be 
able to afford private school," Price said, as he took notes on a yellow legal 
pad about where to send his complaints concerning the 1994 California Learning 
Assessment System tests. "If this test is as screwed up as I've heard it is, 
I'll be putting them in private school." 
</P>
<P>
 After months of criticism that the new tests are too subjective and violate 
students' privacy by questioning them about moral issues, the state unveiled 
the language-arts portions of the CLAS exams Monday at 41 sites around the 
state. They will be on display for a month. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, Price was one of 10 people who showed up to review the 
tests. According to state Department of Education spokeswoman Susie Lange, 
response was similarly slow around the state. Some sites reported no visitors, 
Lange said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a big non-event," Lange said Monday evening. "Maybe some of it is that 
people didn't really know it was happening, but it's basically a 
disappointment. We were ready to showcase our stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there was a steady trickle of visitors to the Costa Mesa headquarters 
of the County Department of Education, where the thousands of pages comprising 
the exams were laid out neatly in a conference room that houses curriculum 
materials for parental perusal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 First in line was Cheryl Gish of Orange, who came toting Kim, 7, and Tyler, 
who is nearly 2, in a stroller. Gish and her sister-in-law, Cheryl George of 
Santa Maria, said they came to see whether rumors of violence-laden literature 
were true. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, both women said, their fears were not assuaged, though they 
appreciated the chance to see the tests their children are asked to take.

HOSPITAL NEAR CONSTRUCTION NOISE SUES TOLL ROAD AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The clamor of pile drivers working on the San Joaquin Hills toll road is 
undermining the mental health of patients at a nearby psychiatric hospital, 
according to a lawsuit filed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The patients . . . are undergoing treatment for substance abuse, chemical 
dependency, depression, schizophrenia and other illnesses," according to the 
lawsuit filed by Community Psychiatric Centers against the San Joaquin Hills 
Transportation Corridor Agency."Some patients are confined to a locked ward and 
a number of patients are under constant suicide watch." 
</P>
<P>
 The medical company maintains a private psychiatric hospital -- Laguna Hills 
Hospital -- near the site where construction workers are building a multilaned 
public toll road expected to be completed by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 The constant operation of pile drivers from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day for the 
past two months, the lawsuit contends, has prevented the hospital from 
"maintaining a proper environment" for the care and treatment of its patients. 
"The operation of the hospital requires that the patients be afforded a 
tranquil and safe environment in which to obtain treatment and recuperate from 
any illness or trauma they may have sustained," the lawsuit says. "The noise 
and vibrations . . . prevent (the hospital) from conducting its business." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit asks for $100,000 in damages as a result of the alleged disturbance 
of its patients. In addition, it asks for another $100,000 in compensation for 
vibration-caused physical damages the lawsuit contends have been inflicted on 
the building itself.

STREISAND RETURNS -- BUT THE THRILL LEVEL DOESN'T; CONCERT: SHE MAKES UP 
PERFORMANCES AT THE POND OF ANAHEIM THAT WERE CANCELED IN MAY BECAUSE OF 
ILLNESS DURING HER FIRST TOUR IN 20 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 She conquered, she canceled, she came. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbra Streisand, who called off her first performance at The Pond of Anaheim 
in May because of viral tracheololaryngitis, returned to make it up Monday 
night, but for some the thrill just wasn't the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "The excitement of Barbra, the aura of her being in Anaheim, has fizzled," 
said Don Myers, general manager of The Catch restaurant nearby, who is running 
shuttles all week to The Pond but nixed plans he had made in May to stage 
Streisand look-alike and karaoke sound-alike contests. "We've been sold out for 
10 days for Streisand, but it's not the same as the first week, when there was 
this big countdown: 10 more days till Barbra, nine more days . . . Now it's 
(just) a postponed show. 
</P>
<P>
 When Streisand announced her first live performances in 20 years as part of a 
tour that she maintains will be her last, fans gladly paid up to $350 per 
ticket for the chance to hear her in May at The Pond of Anaheim. Many flew in 
specifically for the concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 But when illness forced the postponement of four of the six local concerts, 
fans realized that a chance was all they had bought. For ticket holders who 
couldn't accommodate new dates -- she opened Monday and continues Wednesday, 
Friday and Sunday -- that chance was lost forever. But for many of those who 
could, happy days are here again. 
</P>
<P>
 Or at least pretty happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Terri Mammano of Costa Mesa, for instance, said that although her excitement 
level is still high, "We did kind of get worked up, and it was a little letdown 
to wait and wait and wait and wait and wait." Mammano is holding tickets for 
Sunday's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 But the wait was over for those in the parking lot outside Monday's show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am so excited, I tell you, I feel like a little kid at Christmas," said 
Joan Virga of Corona. "I was disappointed that day, but . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 Mary Allen of Newport Beach agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wore a black arm band the morning the concert was canceled, but I figure 
tonight's going to be her best concert, because she has a lot to make up for 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in May, the $350 price tag for the best seats sounded like a lot. It is, 
in fact, still the most expensive ticket for a touring performer. But coming on 
the heels of Saturday's Luciano Pavarotti-Placido Domingo-Jose Carreras concert 
at Dodger Stadium, where top tickets fetched $1,012, Streisand seemed like a 
bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 That concert was billed "Concert of the Century" and Greg Williford of Orange 
watched it on television. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved it." he said. "But I didn't go to that one, so this one is the 
concert of the century. I can buy that one on CD." 
</P>
<P>
 But for some fans Monday night, the anticipation of that first canceled 
concert just couldn't be revived. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was devastated," said a fan who requested anonymity. "My bubble has been 
burst. That was opening night. This is just another night."

ARIZONA HOME SEARCHED FOR BODIES; SUSPECT: 'THE MYSTERY TO BE SOLVED NOW IS: 
WHO IS FAMALARO?' SAYS AN OFFICIAL. HIS LIFE HAS BEEN FILLED WITH 
CONTRADICTIONS, ACCORDING TO REPORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN WEIKEL and REBECCA TROUNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Joseph Famalaro's mother was devoutly religious and a well-known 
political activist in Santa Ana who championed conservative causes. His older 
brother is a convicted felon who was once committed to a state mental hospital 
for sexually assaulting two patients when he was chiropractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro's former neighbors in Lake Forest describe him as amiable and 
charming, waving regularly at them as he drove by. But when he moved out, he 
left behind an angry landlord concerned about property damage and a list of 
dissatisfied customers who had hired him to paint their homes or make repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 According to acquaintances, friends and law enforcement officials interviewed 
Monday, Famalaro's life, both as a child and adult, is filled with 
contradictions which may or may not help explain his alleged involvement in the 
death of Denise Huber in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mystery to be solved now is: Who is Famalaro?" said Costa Mesa Police Lt. 
Ron Smith, who is investigating Huber's death. "Denise was the mystery for 
three years. But he's the mystery now. He had the body frozen and kept moving 
it around. Bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro, 37, is the prime suspect in the slaying of Huber, who grew up in 
Northridge before moving to Newport Beach. Her disappearance three years ago 
sparked a frustrating nationwide search that finally ended last week with the 
grim discovery of her body in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise A. Huber's family, who were well known in San Fernando Valley 
Presbyterian church circles before moving to Orange County, said Monday they 
have received tremendous emotional and moral support in the days since her body 
was found in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've have received a lot of calls," said Denise Huber's mother, Ione Huber. 
"It's been amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 The recent discovery of their daughter's body and the subsequent media 
attention continues to take their toll on her and her husband, Dennis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really drained," she said. "We're doing OK and we're hanging on, but 
we've got a tough couple of weeks ahead of us." 
</P>
<P>
 The family said they will hold a memorial service for Denise Huber 1 p.m. 
Saturday at Mariner's Church, 1000 Bison Ave., in Newport Beach. Those planning 
to attend may call (714) 640-6010 for information. 
</P>
<P>
 Another memorial service, followed by the funeral, is tentatively scheduled 
for July 28 in South Dakota, where the family plans to move this summer. The 
funeral may be postponed if the Yavapai County medical examiners don't release 
the body as scheduled, a family member said. 
</P>
<P>
 From all accounts, Famalaro was brought up on North Victoria Street in Santa 
Ana, an upper-middle-class area where his family moved in 1956 from Long 
Island, N.Y. The Famalaros were Roman Catholic, and John, as well as his 
brother Warren and sister Marion, eventually attended St. Joseph Elementary, a 
local parochial school. 
</P>
<P>
 Acquaintances described his mother Anne as a "righteous, very opinionated" 
person, who harbored strong dislikes. In contrast, neighbors said, her husband 
Angelo was exceptionally quiet and mild-mannered. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for Anne Famalaro's involvement in Santa Ana city politics, family 
members generally kept to themselves, and the Famalaro children were rarely 
allowed to play with other youngsters in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 While in Santa Ana, Anne Famalaro championed conservative causes, including 
the "fundamental schools" movement in the city. She ran unsuccessfully for City 
Council in 1981, and belonged to several groups including the now-defunct 
Republican Women's Club of Santa Ana, a Santa Ana beautification committee, and 
the Freedoms Foundation of Valley Forge, a nonpartisan group that promotes the 
nation's heritage through educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a very wonderful woman. . . . She did a lot of good community work," 
said Beverly Schick, who knew Anne Famalaro. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, the eldest child, Warren J. Famalaro, an Orange County chiropractor, 
was convicted of sexually assaulting two of his patients, a 10-year-old boy and 
a 16-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 He was committed to Patton State Mental Hospital for 8 years, 8 months, and 
lost his chiropractor's license. He was transferred to an outpatient treatment 
facility in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Famalaro family, who now live in Arizona, refused to comment 
Monday.

Carvajal contributed to this story.

ARIZONA HOME SEARCHED FOR BODIES; INQUIRY: AUTHORITIES USE TRAINED DOGS TO COMB 
BASEMENT OF MAN CHARGED IN DEATH OF FORMER NORTHRIDGE WOMAN.

<P>
 Building their case against murder suspect John Joseph Famalaro, Arizona and 
Costa Mesa authorities have recovered clothing believed worn by a former 
Northridge woman the night she vanished from Orange County three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The clothing, a black mini-skirt and other articles, were discovered in a box 
inside Famalaro's cluttered Prescott Country Club home. They were identified by 
Costa Mesa police and could be key evidence linking him to Denise Huber, whose 
nude body was found frozen in the back of a stolen rental truck parked in his 
driveway in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators on Monday also interviewed employees of a San Clemente 
self-storage facility where Famalaro rented seven units from July, 1992 -- a 
year after Huber disappeared -- to February of this year. Famalaro contracted 
to have constant power maintained to the locker where he kept his personal 
belongings, including a freezer that may have been the one in which Huber's 
body was discovered last week, said Harry Tosado, facility manager of Allsize 
Self-Storage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole time the freezer was here, he wanted 24-hour electricity, which 
people here thought was very odd," Tosado said. "It's written right on the 
contract '24-hours.' " 
</P>
<P>
 When Famalaro moved the last of his belongings out of the facility in 
February, he asked the employees to help load the freezer onto his truck 
without delay.  
</P>
<P>
 "He said he had a generator on his truck that would keep the freezer running 
while he was driving, but the main thing was, he wanted it loaded real quick," 
Tosado said. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Huber grew up in Northridge, where her family moved in 1973. The family 
was active in Presbyterian churches in North Hills and Calabasas before moving 
to Newport Beach. She attended Los Angeles Baptist High School in North Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery of the clothing and other personal effects, meanwhile, has led 
authorities to consider filing an additional charge of kidnaping against 
Famalaro, said Costa Mesa Police Lt. Ron Smith, which would make it a capital 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 There were these other developments Monday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Authorities are investigating the source of the chest freezer, and believe 
it may have been bought at a Montgomery Ward store in the Orange County area 
shortly after Huber's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fingerprints have been lifted from the freezer and officials are attempting 
to match those to Famalaro. 
</P>
<P>
 * A Yavapai County (Arizona) grand jury will consider an indictment in the 
case as early as Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Famalaro's defense attorney, Lawrence W. Katz, said he is 
disturbed by the public attention to his client and what he fears is an 
assumption of guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a total circumstance case," Katz said, adding that the stakes are 
especially high because his client could face the death penalty. "I'm not sure 
how you go from a frozen body in a freezer to murder." 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro was being held in lieu of $250,000 bond in Yavapai County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber's frozen body was found face-down inside the 23-cubic-foot freezer with 
her wrists handcuffed behind her, Yavapai County Sheriff G.C. Buck Buchanan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Huber appeared to have received about 10 to 12 blows and 
lacerations on the head, such as could have been inflicted by a hammer or crow 
bar. Tools and construction equipment were seized from the home of Famalaro, 
who has been making his living as a house painter, contract handyman and real 
estate agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said there were no signs of sexual abuse, but the frozen condition of 
the body may prove helpful in further examination.  
</P>
<P>
 But Smith said that the circumstances of Huber's disappearance on June 3, 1991 
might remain forever a mystery, adding that it is still unclear whether Huber 
was taken by force or was somehow enticed to accompany her assailant. Her car 
was found abandoned with a flat tire on a Costa Mesa freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mystery to be solved now is: Who is Famalaro?" Smith said. "Denise was 
the mystery for three years, but he's the mystery now. He had the body frozen 
and kept moving it around. Bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
 The description seemed an apt one to the many law enforcement officials who 
converged on Famalaro's house Monday. Said Sheriff Buchanan: "I've been 
involved in some bizarre cases, but this has got to be one of the most 
bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, Costa Mesa and Arizona officials were searching for other 
possible victims on Famalaro's hilltop property. Officials have called for an 
excavation team that will begin digging at three sites there. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second time in as many days, search dogs from Utah found three "areas 
of interest," two in the suspect's dirt-floor basement and another under a 
back-yard shed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what we will find in there," Berra said. "But we want to leave 
this house knowing that there is nothing left to be found." 
</P>
<P>
 Buchanan said the search will continue Tuesday and was partly prompted by the 
discovery of the names of 10 women during the search of Famalaro's home. 
</P>
<P>
 By late Monday afternoon, authorities had contacted five of the 10 -- some 
located in Phoenix and Southern California. The remaining five were still being 
sought. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found the names and we feel the need to check them out," Berra said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities also are concerned with the largely circumstantial nature of the 
case. It has led them to cart away file cabinets full of Famalaro's personal 
documents and possessions for further examination. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, all we have is a man in custody, a body found in a rental truck in 
his driveway and some of the victim's personal effects," Berra said. "That's 
not enough to prove guilt." 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to know where he's been and what he's been doing the past three 
years. We need to know much more about this man." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors, who are in the midst of deciding whether Yavapai or Orange County 
officials will handle the case, have not indicated whether they will seek the 
death penalty.

MISSING COUPLE BLAMED FOR ALLEGED CAR SCAM; COURTS: JUDGES UPHOLD LAWSUIT 
CLAIMING THAT TWO DEALERS CONTRIBUTED TO LOSSES SUFFERED BY 14 OTHERS BY 
UNQUESTIONINGLY BUYING AUTOS THEY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN WERE UNDERPRICED. 
</P>

 Call it the battle of the Toyota dealerships. Or car wars. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly three years after car brokers Dan and Mayumi Nishikawa bought 
first-class flights to Japan for themselves, their children and their cat, auto 
dealerships throughout Southern California are winding up a messy civil 
lawsuit, which alleged that the couple wrote $1.8 million in rubber checks in 
1991 so they could, in effect, defraud them out of 129 pricey automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the car dealers say the Nishikawas, who cannot be found, told car 
dealers that they and their Torrance-based PIAA Inc. car brokerage were "ethnic 
brokers," who bought new cars and sold them to Asian and Asian-American buyers 
wary of non-Asian car salespeople. 
</P>
<P>
 But lawyers for 14 car dealerships -- 13 Toyota franchises and Lexus of Santa 
Monica -- alleged the Nishikawas actually had pulled off a "Ponzi-like scheme" 
on them by gaining their trust over several years, then writing bad checks on 
one huge, final purchase of cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The dealers alleged in a suit in Los Angeles Superior Court that the 
Nishikawas were aided by a lack of caution at Toyota of North Hollywood and 
Koreatown-based Han Kook Motors Inc. The lawsuit -- pitting the 14 dealerships 
against the two others -- alleged that the Nishikawas resold many of the autos 
they bought to those two dealerships, at prices so low the dealerships' 
executives should have been suspicious of the sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday, a state appellate court panel generally agreed with that 
assessment. The three-judge Appellate District panel, with little comment, 
upheld a 1993 Superior Court ruling in favor of the 14 dealerships. The panel's 
decision means that whatever happened to the money -- and to the Nishikawas -- 
the lower court order stands, requiring Toyota of North Hollywood and Han Kook 
Motors to pay about $1.8 million to the dealerships for the cars, plus court 
costs and interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the basic principle of robbing Peter to pay Paul until the whole thing 
collapses," said Norris Bishton, a lawyer representing the 14 dealers, who also 
owns one of them, Toyota of Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Court testimony by an employee of PIAA -- or Pacific Imported Automobiles of 
America -- described the Nishikawas as doing very well for themselves -- 
trading up from a small rented South Bay apartment to several posh houses, and 
living a lavish lifestyle complete with weekly shopping trips to Rodeo Drive 
for $5,000 suits and a white limousine to ferry their children to school, 
according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Just about everything else in the case remains hotly contested, including 
whether the Nishikawas spent the money on their posh lifestyle as they went 
along, lost it in bad business deals or absconded with the loot at the end, 
when the alleged scheme collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Toyota Motor Sales USA, which oversees all Toyota franchise dealerships in 
this country, declined to comment. "They tried to stay out of it, legally they 
stayed out of it, but they are in the middle of it," because they must deal 
with parties on both sides, one lawyer said of Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
 One Toyota executive, who asked not to be identified, agreed, saying the 
parent corporation has taken great pains to stay neutral. "It would be between 
the dealers," said John Matt, vice president of sales for Toyota Motor Sales 
USA. "Certainly there was a dispute and a conflict between the dealers 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
 According to testimony and court documents, the Nishikawas were middlemen of 
sorts who over several years bought thousands of brand-new Toyotas and Lexuses 
from dealers from Carlsbad to Thousand Oaks to San Bernardino, then sold them 
at cost, or a loss, to Han Kook or the North Hollywood dealership, while 
keeping some of the proceeds for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 But all that, lawyers for the 14 dealerships allege in court documents, was 
part of an even larger setup to gain the trust of dealership executives before 
defrauding them in a big final score. In October, 1991, the Nishikawas bought 
179 new cars for about $2.6 million, sold most of them to Toyota of North 
Hollywood and Han Kook Motors, then left the country before anyone realized 
they had paid for the cars with nonexistent funds, lawyers allege in court 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Toyota of North Hollywood and Han Kook Motors "should have been more 
suspicious that something was wrong," because the Nishikawas had been selling 
them cars for less than the Toyota factory's wholesale price, Bishton said. 
"They knew (something was wrong), but they chose to look the other way. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like someone was saying to them, 'We'll sell you $100 bills for $90 
apiece,' " Bishton said. "The court found they . . . chose to look the other 
way while continuing to buy the cars in bad faith." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Nishikawas, Bishton said, he tried to get authorities to extradite 
them to the United States to face criminal prosecution. "I could never interest 
law enforcement in looking for them," Bishton said. "It has been very 
frustrating. They have got away scot-free." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti and an official 
with the state Department of Motor Vehicles said they were unaware of any 
criminal investigations into the Nishikawas or the car deals. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer for Toyota of North Hollywood and Han Kook Motors sees things 
entirely differently. J. Douglas Post contended that his two clients did 
nothing wrong, and that at least some of the other 14 dealers were improperly 
benefiting from the bulk sale of the cars to PIAA, falsely reporting them in 
such a way as to rack up lucrative incentive benefits from the factory. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishton denied any wrongdoing on the part of his clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Post said, the court failed to uphold most of the arguments by lawyers 
for the 14 plaintiff dealerships, including their allegation that the 
Nishikawas and the two dealerships had engaged in a conspiracy or unfair 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Post said the 14 dealerships prevailed only on a so-called "conversion claim" 
against North Hollywood and Han Kook Motors, in which they claimed continuing 
ownership rights to the cars because they were never paid by PIAA. The two 
dealerships, however, claimed that the original 14 dealers lost their ownership 
rights when they sold the vehicles to PIAA on credit, and not for cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Where the cars involved are now was unclear. Lawyers said they were probably 
resold long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is way too complicated to explain," said Post. "We thought we should have 
won everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Post said that the 14 dealers sought $15 million in their original suit, and 
that that figure was whittled down to a judgment of less than $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Nishikawas, Post said: "They lost the money. They didn't go back to 
Japan with a $2-million pot of money. There may have been shopping trips to 
Rodeo Drive and whatnot," Post said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But most of the cars that they didn't get paid for was money lost by the 
Nishikawas. PIAA lost that money in the business of buying and selling cars." 
</P>
<P>
 Post said his clients' only failing was an innocent one. "The judges found 
that we should have known that these plaintiffs retained some ownership rights 
to the cars they sold to PIAA by virtue of that fact that they didn't end up 
getting paid," Post said. "There was no way for us to know that." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Nishikawas were selling the cars at a loss to build up a 
relationship with the dealers on both sides, and that they ultimately wanted to 
recoup their losses by opening a retail facility in Torrance to sell cars to 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Much speculation remains regarding exactly what it was the Nishikawas were 
trying to accomplish by buying so many cars and then selling them at or below 
their cost to other dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some speculated that they had planned to open their own dealership or car lot, 
and recoup some of the profits. But since the Nishikawas never answered court 
summonses demanding that they appear in court for the civil trial, no one may 
ever know, say lawyers involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if we'll ever know exactly why they did it. It sounds like an 
awful way to run a railroad," said another attorney for the 14 dealerships, 
Thomas S. Nessinger. "They purchased plane tickets for themselves, their 
children and their cat in 1991, just when the whole thing was crashing, and 
just kind of left some American employees to sit there and face this mob. So I 
guess the cat is on the lam too."

JAMES SENT TO PRISON RATHER THAN REHAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Singer Rick James, famous for his 1981 hit "Super Freak," was ordered to begin 
serving five years and four months in state prison Monday after a Van Nuys 
Superior Court judge refused his last-ditch appeal to enter a drug 
rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Judge Michael R. Hoff told the Grammy Award winner that he was lucky 
he wasn't headed to prison for a dozen years, perhaps even for life, in 
connection with two violent attacks against women. The judge called the shorter 
sentence "a gift." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, court records released for the first time reveal James' tales of a 
troubled childhood and the depths of an addiction that consumed half his life 
and made him a virtual recluse. 
</P>
<P>
 James, 46, was convicted last year in connection with assaults on two women at 
his home and at the St. James's Club & Hotel in West Hollywood and could have 
faced nine to 12 years in prison on those counts, Deputy Dist. Atty. Andrew 
Flier said. The jury was hung on a torture charge that carries a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 But before prosecutors could retry James on that count, allegations surfaced 
that a district attorney's investigator had furnished drugs to a jailed witness 
who testified against James. The investigator was not directly involved in the 
James case, Flier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoff told James on Monday that "he can thank the D.A.'s investigator for his 
continued luck." 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged misconduct is being investigated by the state attorney general, 
and the investigator no longer works for the district attorney's office, a 
source close to the case said.  
</P>
<P>
 Because of the scandal and internal probe, James was allowed to plead no 
contest to assault charges involving the attack at this home. Prosecutors said 
James and his girlfriend, model Tanya Anne Hijazi, imprisoned and tortured a 
woman during a weeklong cocaine binge at his gated house in the Hollywood 
Hills. Hijazi, who pleaded guilty to an assault charge and eventually testified 
against James, is serving two years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the arrangement, James received a shorter sentence and 
prosecutors said they would not oppose his entry into the drug program instead 
of serving time in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 James entered the Civil Addict Program at the state Corrections Rehabilitation 
Center in Norco in February and by all accounts was doing well. 
</P>
<P>
 But Warden Jean E. Anderson decided in May that James didn't qualify because 
his crimes involved acts of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law is clear," said Richard R. Clouse, an attorney for the state 
Corrections Department. Clouse said the department is given "a great deal of 
discretion as to whether any particular person is entitled to the Civil Addict 
Program. The fact that Mr. James is a famous person and a celebrity makes no 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Mark Werksman said James was considering possible appeals. He 
contended that prison officials had been prejudiced against James because of 
his fame and image. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 15 years, he has been known as the Super Freak," Werksman said. "They 
rejected the Super Freak. They never bothered to learn about the real Rick 
James." 
</P>
<P>
 James' real name is James Johnson. He was born in Buffalo, N.Y., and by all 
accounts, was devoted to his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Evaluations in James' court file offer new glimpses into the singer's 
background and the depth of his drug addiction. They are based largely on 
psychologists' interviews with James.  
</P>
<P>
 The reports described James as an abused child who first experimented with 
drugs at 14 and spent half his adult life as an addict. By 1991, he was holed 
up full-time in his bedroom, taking as many as nine Halcion sleeping tablets a 
night and spending up to $1,000 a day on cocaine, according to the reports. 
</P>
<P>
 James, the third of eight children, described his father, James Johnson Sr., 
as an abusive alcoholic who left when he was 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rick observed that his father was 'very sadistic' with his mother and beat 
her often," criminologist Sheila Balkan wrote in her Dec. 23 evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once in a while I would try to help her, but my father told me I'd get it if 
I didn't stay out of it," James told Balkan.  
</P>
<P>
 After his father left, James' devoutly religious mother, Betty Gladden, worked 
two jobs: as a maid, "and in the numbers rackets," which James said made him 
ashamed, according to the reports. She also beat the children after her husband 
left, the reports said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For Rick, his mother was the main abuser. He relates that she was often 
uncontrollable, and that she administered beatings with a knotted electrical 
cord for little or no reason, 'letting out her frustrations on us kids.' " 
</P>
<P>
 James told the psychologists that social services workers came to the family's 
tenement several times, but the children refused to leave because, James said, 
"we were all a team." 
</P>
<P>
 As a child, James told psychologist Raymond E. Anderson, he would take walks 
and become absorbed in thought. Sometimes, he'd walk 10 to 15 miles. He ran 
away to get his mother's attention.  
</P>
<P>
 His relationship with his mother improved as he grew older, and she was 
supportive of his musical career. Later, he said, she became his "best friend." 
</P>
<P>
 James said he started using drugs, including marijuana and heroin, during his 
mid-teens. His career in music exposed him to more drugs, which he consumed in 
increasingly large amounts after his first album in 1977 made him an overnight 
success.  
</P>
<P>
 "With my first check, I bought all the drugs I could afford," he told Balkan. 
He started freebasing cocaine in 1981, the same year "Super Freak" started its 
climb up the charts.  
</P>
<P>
 "By about 1985, I was spending several hundred thousand dollars a year on 
cocaine," James said. "Doing coke was not a social thing with me. I did it by 
myself in a back room of my house a lot of the time. I felt like I had a big 
hole inside me, and getting high seemed to fill it for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 With his new wealth, James bought his mother a big house in Buffalo. "Anything 
she wanted, she had it," he said. He also became surrounded by hangers-on, and 
his addiction fueled feelings of paranoia and betrayal, Balkan's report said.  
</P>
<P>
 By the late 1980s, he said he was spiraling downward. He was involved in a 
lawsuit with Motown Records and didn't write or record for four years. In fact, 
he says he didn't even leave his bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "My housekeeper would put food in front of the door. I was staying in my 
bedroom watching movies, talking with people on the phone and getting high." 
</P>
<P>
 When his suit with Motown was settled in 1990, James returned to the studio, 
but took the next two years to produce his next album. "The drugs really took 
their toll," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother was diagnosed with cancer in 1990 and died the following year. 
During that time, he said, "I would lock myself in my room and get high all the 
time. I couldn't believe I was losing her. She hated seeing the way I was. She 
told me my house was a tomb for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after his mother's death, James restrained and burned a young woman 
with a hot pipe during a weeklong cocaine binge in July, 1991, at his house in 
the Hollywood Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 He was free on bail in November, 1992, when the second assault occurred in 
James' room on the 11th floor of the St. James's Club & Hotel on Sunset 
Boulevard.  
</P>
<P>
 The experts who evaluated James agreed that he probably wouldn't have hurt the 
women but for the influence of cocaine, and that he would have benefited from 
the state's drug program.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; ONCE-POPULAR BAKERY CLOSES AFTER 27 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO

<TEXT>
<P>
 The empty shelves behind the counter bore witness to the sad truth: The bakery 
half of Weby's Bakery and Dely has gone out of business after 27 years.  
</P>
<P>
 The bakery, a community fixture, closed on July 3, but as late as Monday, 
customers were still reacting with surprise and dismay at seeing the barren 
display cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened to the bakery?" they demanded of Frank Ready, who co-owns the 
deli counter across the aisle from the bakery. The two separately owned 
businesses shared a storefront on Ventura Boulevard just west of Laurel Canyon 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The bakery was a victim of the slow economy, the migration of longtime 
customers and changing eating habits, said Gary Schwartz, 54, who bought the 
business from Ruben Weber, the original Weby, in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's become, not by design, a nonprofit organization in the last three 
years," Schwartz said wryly. 
</P>
<P>
 Ready said that Viktor Benes' Continental Bakery, which runs the bakery in the 
Encino Gelson's Market, will be taking over the opposite counter at the 
beginning of next month.  
</P>
<P>
 But the building owner, David Raznick, said that Benes' is just one of three 
companies with whom he is negotiating to decide who will run the new bakery. 
"It's coming back," Raznick said, "It will properly be back in by the next 
month." Raznick is Weber's son-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime customers said that Weby's Bakery, which was known for its 
special-occasion cakes, will be missed. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were little we used to get birthday cakes here," said Studio City 
resident Robin Gepner, as another customer, Linda Silver, nodded.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody in Studio City seemed to come here for bakery stuff," said Florence 
Omens, a North Hollywood homemaker. "It's like an old friend." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of a shock to me; they'd been there so long," said Alan Fried, who 
said he had bought breads and cakes there since the original owner opened the 
place in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 "I aged with them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz once did a bustling trade with the nearby CBS, ABC, Warner Bros. and 
Disney studios, and he counted Mary Tyler Moore and Sally Field among his 
customers. In recent years, he said, it appeared to him that the studios were 
getting less production work, and his business declined. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of sad, but life goes on," Schwartz said. "We'll do what we have 
to do and move on to other things." KAY HWANGBO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: DONATIONS DOWN FOR SUMMER CAMP FUND 
</P>

<P>
 Dwindling donations to the Salvation Army's summer camp fund, attributed to 
the many disasters that have ravaged California, are endangering the 
opportunities for underprivileged youths to participate in a six-day outing in 
Malibu Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are down 29% from last year, in terms of sponsorship," said Beverly 
Ventriss, director of communications for the Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last 40 years, the Salvation Army has sponsored Mt. Crags and Gilmore 
camps, geared toward giving about 2,500 underprivileged youths ages 7 to 16 a 
few days of camping experience -- playing sports, studying nature and 
participating in arts classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual expense of sending one child to camp is $150, but donations and 
grants reduces that amount to about $30. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel sensitive to the fact that people have been asked to give so much 
recently," said Ventriss. "We want to encourage the public to extend the hand 
of generosity one more time to our needy youth." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventriss said the Malibu Canyon camps, which will continue through the end of 
August, often mark the first time these children experience life in the 
country-side. MAKI BECKER

GETTING INVOLVED: MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY: RACING TO FIND 
ABANDONED PETS A HOME

 On a rainy day last year, Farron Fields found his Guinevere, a black, white 
and brown Doberman/German shepherd mix, emaciated and sopping wet. For Fields, 
it would be the beginning of two lessons, one about the tragedy of abandoned 
animals, the other about the joy they can bring. 
</P>
<P>
 Combining both, Fields and his girlfriend, Lara Minassian, have organized what 
they have dubbed the "Canine-Human World Cross Country Championship," to be 
held in Woodley Park in Van Nuys on July 30. 
</P>
<P>
 A runner and a dog lover all his life, Fields had never combined the two 
passions until he rescued and adopted Guinevere, then about 6 months old. They 
started running together, and "it was the most fun I'd ever had running," 
Fields said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fields, a Northridge resident, now runs 50 to 60 miles a week with her, 
admitting, "She's a better runner than me." 
</P>
<P>
 The races in the July 30 championship include both canine-human events and 
people-only races. Proceeds will be donated to organizations that find homes 
for abandoned animals. He expects as many as 400 animal lovers to race with 
their dogs. But he needs volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a growing problem and it's not getting any better," Fields said about 
the issue of abandoned and homeless pets, which he's been learning about in the 
year since he found Guinevere. 
</P>
<P>
 Guinevere has changed his life in other ways, Fields said. A stretchable dog 
leash he invented to make his runs with the dog easier has led him and 
Minassian to start a new business of pet toys and accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 The contests will begin at 7:30 a.m. and include two races 2.1 miles long, one 
for people only; a 1.6-mile race for those 18 years and under, and a one-mile 
fun walk. There will also be demonstrations of guide dogs for the handicapped, 
Frisbee-catching dogs and police dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who want to volunteer are asked to call the Volunteer Center of the San 
Fernando Valley at (818) 908-5066. 
</P>
<P>
 The Descanso Gardens in La Canada Flintridge is accepting applications for its 
docent training program for volunteers who will conduct tours for 
schoolchildren and adults. Training sessions will include classes in botany, 
animal physiology, ecology, the history of the gardens and tour techniques. An 
orientation class will be held Sept. 7 at 9 a.m., with classes continuing every 
Wednesday until Nov. 16. For more information or to apply, call Jim Jackson at 
(818) 248-1083. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese Gardens at the Donald C. Tillman Water Reclamation Plant, 6100 
Woodley Ave., Van Nuys, will begin a training program at the end of July for 
volunteers interested in becoming docents. For information call (818) 756-8166 
from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Project Caring, sponsored by the Jewish Family Service of Los Angeles, is 
looking for small groups of volunteers to adopt a nursing home in their 
neighborhood, to visit monthly and provide programs to the residents that 
relate to Jewish culture and holidays. For information, call Kay Ginsberg at 
(310) 859-9336 or Tara Eisner at (818) 905-2125. 
</P>
<P>
 The Visiting Nurse Assn. of Los Angeles is looking for volunteers to work with 
terminally ill patients in the Santa Clarita Valley area. Volunteers in the 
hospice program help patients to face their illnesses at home, and offer 
support to their families. A training session is scheduled for July 30. 
Interested volunteers should call Barbara Balke at (805) 287-1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteer tutors are needed to help adult immigrants learn to speak, read and 
write English in the English as a second language program at the Glendale YWCA, 
735 E. Lexington Drive. An orientation meeting with no obligation will be held 
at 7 p.m. Aug. 3. Workshop sessions will be on four consecutive Saturdays from 
9 a.m. to 1 p.m. beginning Aug. 6. Information: Nena Kelty at (818) 242-4155, 
Ext. 26.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: RECORD STORES COLLECT FOOD FOR THE NEEDY

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than half a ton of non-perishable food was collected for the Los Angeles 
Regional Foodbank last month during a canned-goods drive sponsored by Moby Disc 
Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Food was collected at all of the record-store chain's Los Angeles-area 
locations.At the two San Fernando Valley locations alone, 397 pounds of food -- 
translating roughly into 397 meals -- was collected, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Feed the Hungry While You Feed Your Ears" was the slogan of the food drive, 
set up so that people bringing a can of food to any Moby Disc location received 
discounts on compact discs. BAM magazine and KROQ-FM also were sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 Foodbank officials said that summer is an especially slow time for food 
donations. The organization feeds the hungry throughout Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very impressed," said Tracy Brophy, marketing director for Moby Disc 
Records. "A lot of people said that this was their way of doing their good deed 
for the year. They wanted to keep bringing in things after the drive ended."

 The Sherman Oaks Town Council has discussed ways to encourage the 
establishment of a community newspaper with a strong focus on local news. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a gap that's missing," Nancy Schmidt, president of the Sherman Oaks 
Chamber of Commerce, said last week."It provides a way for the women's club to 
talk about what they're doing, or for the YMCA to talk about what they're 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Two options for nurturing a newspaper were discussed by the Town Council last 
week. One option would be for one of the council's member-entities to contract 
with a newsletter company, which would publish the newspaper. The other is to 
support an independent newspaper publisher's establishment of a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall Media Group -- which publishes the Santa Monica News, Brentwood News and 
Westwood News -- is said to be considering the Sherman Oaks-Studio City area 
for a possible fourth edition. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Publisher Jeff Hall said) he is investigating this area," said Schmidt. "His 
company is determining whether there is enough financial support -- in other 
words, advertising -- to develop a paper." KAY HWANGBO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; DEAN OF ENGINEERING NAMED BY CSUN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Even after the campus of his potential employer was hit by the Northridge 
earthquake in January, Charles Alexander had no misgivings about moving to 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, he decided it could not be any more dangerous than driving in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never really thought anything about it," said Alexander, who was named last 
week as the new dean of the School of Engineering and Computer Science at Cal 
State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander, 50, comes to Northridge from Temple University in Philadelphia, 
where he is the acting dean of the College of Engineering. He had been a 
professor and chairman of the department of electrical engineering at Temple 
since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 As Cal State Northridge continues to recover from the earthquake, Alexander 
said he knows "there's a lot of work to be done and a lot to be accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he was impressed watching how the school was able to recover from 
the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "The faculty, staff and administration were absolutely incredible to keep the 
school functioning after the earthquake," Alexander said. "The energy and 
cooperation to do that just staggers the mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander replaces acting Dean Diane Schwartz, who has headed the department 
for two years. He will officially take over the job on Sept. 1, although he 
will be on campus next month to familiarize himself with the school. ED BOND

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; RETRAINING AGENCY MOVES TO LARGER SITE

<P>
 The 9-year-old Glendale Community College Professional Development Center has 
moved into larger quarters in Montrose to expand its services into other 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The center is the largest provider of contract education -- featuring 
consultants who travel to companies to retrain employees -- among the nation's 
community colleges, said Mike Davitt, a project facilitator. 
</P>
<P>
 College officials will join center employees at a ribbon-cutting ceremony and 
an All-American Western Celebration to kick off an open house at the center, 
located at 2340 Honolulu Ave., from 6 to 9 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The new site, with administrative offices and five classrooms, is about 20% 
larger than the organization's former headquarters on Central Avenue in 
Glendale, Davitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Funded through grants from the state's employment training panel, the center 
has helped more than 6,000 companies train 16,000 employees to use new 
technologies, said Wendy Grove, an editorial assistant at the college. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies are not required to pay a fee to receive help from the center, but 
must guarantee that employees enrolled in retraining courses will complete 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 The center works mainly with aerospace firms to retrain workers on computer 
systems so they can become more competitive and profitable, Davitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the center is a division of Glendale Community College, it does not 
concentrate on training students. Instead, it markets its services to companies 
located both in and outside of Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 The center has brought more than $25 million to the college since it was 
established in 1985 through fees from companies who are uncomfortable taking 
state money to retrain their workers, Davitt said. JENNIFER OLDHAM

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; FUND-RAISER PLANNED FOR BOYS & GIRLS CLUB 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Boys & Girls Club of Burbank is stepping up its fund-raising campaign in 
an attempt to open its doors by September, the Rev. Jerry Jones, the club's 
president has said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, former City Councilman Tim Murphy formed a steering committee 
to organize the local club. The committee has attained nonprofit status with 
the Internal Revenue Service, obtained a building and completed most of the 
preparations to establish the club. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the committee needs to hire an executive director and complete a few 
last-minute renovations.  
</P>
<P>
 The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers has agreed to do all of 
the electrical work at no cost. The local plumbers association will redo the 
restrooms to make them accessible to the disabled. The city will pave the 
parking lot in exchange for the right to use it.  
</P>
<P>
 All that is needed now is $40,000 to pay the annual salary and benefits for an 
executive director, who will be hired as soon as the money is available, Jones 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 It is expected that once the executive director is hired, he or she would be 
able to raise the funds necessary to keep the club operational. 
</P>
<P>
 "People give money to support a club that is doing things," Jones said. "It's 
harder to get money to start up a new program." 
</P>
<P>
 There are several ways to raise the $40,000, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee is awaiting word from "a major corporation in the area who is 
seriously considering donating the money," he said. If this occurs, the club 
could open as early as September. 
</P>
<P>
 The club also is planning several fund-raising events. A mixer is tentatively 
scheduled for Sept. 8 at the club, 2244 N. Buena Vista St. Also planned is a 
"giant" parking lot sale sometime in September. Donations for the sale can be 
made by calling (818) 846-5523.  
</P>
<P>
 Once it is in operation, the club will be open on weekdays after school and on 
Saturdays. JAMES ELMENDORF

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; WAR ROMANCE HAS ENDURED FOR 50 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Love in war was more than fair to Allan and Rene Gottlieb. The fireworks of 
their courtship were buzz bombs, brilliant flashes in the night skies of 
England during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a 26-year-old dentist in the U. S. Army who had just arrived for duty 
in England. She was in the British Army, drafted at 21 as a wireless radio 
operator stationed in Preston. Fifty years later, the war just a chapter in the 
history of their lives, the Gottliebs, now of Calabasas, are celebrating a love 
that has lasted a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 They met on a dance floor in Preston on a gloomy February night in 1944. Allan 
spotted Rene dancing with his friend and asked to switch partners. They fell in 
love as they fox-trotted and waltzed the night away. "Allan took a fancy to me 
and I took a fancy to him," Rene said. "It was love ever since." 
</P>
<P>
 But circumstances soon separated them.  
</P>
<P>
 Allan, a Brooklyn native, was transferred to treat soldiers in Belgium. But he 
says he could think of nothing but Rene. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fell head over heels," he said. "I would chase all over England trying to 
get to her." 
</P>
<P>
 Allan would hitch rides on bombers and military transport planes, making every 
excuse to return to England. Finally, he arranged to be transferred back and 
the two were married in an old temple in Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was plenty of adrenaline flowing in those days," Rene said. "It was a 
very exciting time."  
</P>
<P>
 The rabbi who married them had to stop the ceremony whenever a bomber passed 
overhead, listening to make sure it faded into the distance before continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Their real honeymoon came two years later. The war had ended and Allan was in 
New York awaiting Rene's arrival after a six-month separation. She arrived on 
the Queen Mary, with thousands of other brides making the voyage to rejoin the 
husbands they had met during the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Allan remembers scanning the crowded waiting room for a glimpse of her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally I spotted her," he said. "It was the thrill of my life." A reporter 
from the New York Post picked the couple out of the crowd at random and 
recorded their whirlwind reunion -- from the top of the RCA building to the 
Waldorf Astoria Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, after Allan retired from his dental practice in Long Island, they 
moved to California to be near their two children and three grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, about 40 friends and family members gathered at their son's home in 
Topanga Canyon to commemorate the Gottliebs' 50 years together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave a toast to life and a toast to romance," said their son, David. "There 
just doesn't seem to be that kind of romance anymore." SUSAN BYRNES

 "I'm walking on clouds right now," Traffic Officer Clark Baker said Monday."My 
reputation was really slimed. I'm trying to re-establish my reputation."  
</P>
<P>
 The charge against Baker, 36, was dropped at the behest of David Sotelo, the 
deputy district attorney who originally prosecuted the case and was later 
criticized by an appeals panel for comments he made to jurors during that 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker was charged in 1992 with battery and using excessive force during the 
1991 jaywalking skirmish with a 21-year-old Salvadoran immigrant in Canoga 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury deadlocked on the excessive force charge, but in 1993 convicted the 
then-12-year veteran of the force on the misdemeanor battery charge. Baker 
appealed, and a Superior Court appeals panel overturned that conviction in 
April, saying prosecutor Sotelo improperly influenced the jury by comparing 
this case with those of the officers charged in the beating of Rodney G. King. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel also said Baker's Glendale attorney, Bob Wilson, failed to provide 
his client adequate counsel by not objecting to Sotelo's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 After Baker filed his appeal, according to Sotelo, the officer went ahead and 
served the sentence of 350 hours of community service, even though the 
conviction was eventually to be overturned. So, Sotelo said, even if the case 
were retried, Baker would have completed his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker, who has been on administrative duty awaiting the outcome of the 
proceedings, will likely be moved back to traffic duty immediately, said his 
current attorney, Barry Levin. ERIC SLATER

BUSINESSES TALLY WORLD CUP RECEIPTS; ECONOMY: SOCCER FEST WAS BONANZA FOR SOME, 
A DISAPPOINTMENT TO OTHERS. OFFICIALS ESTIMATE EVENT PUMPED $620 MILLION INTO 
REGION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The World Cup was supposed to be the financial catalyst that would finally 
lift scores of local businesses out of the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 But a day after the soccer tournament's deciding game, Burbank and Glendale 
retailers were divided on whether their own final score lived up to the hype. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it is still too soon to measure the tournament's economic impact on 
local cities, early reaction from merchants who had expected to reap tourism 
dollars from the world's most popular sporting event ranged from "embarrassing" 
to "fabulous." 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup officials estimated that more than $620 million will have been 
pumped into the Southland's economy when final figures are tallied. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always knew the World Cup may not be what we thought it would be, and that 
actually turned out to be true," said Donna Lum, a spokeswoman for the Media 
City Center shopping mall in Burbank. "We didn't lose any money, but we didn't 
make huge bonanzas." 
</P>
<P>
 The number of visitors to the Media City Center increased since the World Cup 
started June 17. But retailers don't know whether to attribute that to the 
soccer games or the traditional summer shopping season, Lum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Milene Ragan, who opened a kiosk in the Glendale Galleria in November selling 
World Cup soccer jerseys, flags, water bottles, T-shirts and caps, said: "My 
business has been fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
 Ragan said her most popular wares have been items emblazoned with Mexico, 
Italy and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of businesses, with the recession, weren't willing to risk putting out 
the money for a lot of the merchandise and didn't go out of their way for 
Nigeria or Bulgaria, which they thought might not do well," said Ragan, who 
plans to keep her kiosk open through August. "Merchandisers couldn't quite 
gauge what the response would be and didn't order a lot and ordered late. 
Everyone was playing it safe. Sometimes it takes a little risk." 
</P>
<P>
 No one in Burbank or Glendale knows for sure how many visiting soccer fans 
passed through the two cities during the monthlong tournament. But individual 
accounts from restaurateurs, merchants, hotel operators and law enforcement 
officials offer some evidence: 
</P>
<P>
 * On the streets of Glendale, more than 10,000 people partied to 1950s 
rock-and-roll music at a World Cup party Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the Burbank Village area, Fuddruckers restaurant reported a 38% increase 
in income over the weekend, with a higher than normal number of traveler's 
checks being cashed. 
</P>
<P>
 * And farther west, at the Universal CityWalk, hundreds of soccer fans 
gathered at a giant outdoor television screen showing Sunday's final match. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Glendale Galleria, merchants selling World Cup caps, T-shirts and other 
memorabilia say business from soccer fans has been strong since June. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been steady for darn near a whole month," said Rusty DeWitt, manager of 
Foot Locker. "There isn't a day that goes by where there isn't World Cup 
traffic. It's opened the eyes of some merchants, I'd say, to the potential, the 
need and demand for soccer year-round." 
</P>
<P>
 But nationwide, many in the hotel industry have grumbled loudly over planning 
for the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 600 hotels across the country had reserved rooms for the World Cup's 
exclusive, for-profit contractor to resell. 
</P>
<P>
 But the army of fans never showed. So the contractor, the World Cup 
Accommodation Bureau, released the rooms back to the hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank Airport Hilton, for example, initially reserved about 400 of its 
500 rooms for World Cup visitors during the final week of games. By March 1, 
that number dropped to 200. By last week, only 10 rooms were booked through the 
World Cup Accommodation Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the hotel sold all its rooms last week, mostly to soccer fans who 
made their own reservations, a hotel official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Sarno, director of sales and marketing for the Los Angeles Hilton and 
Towers Downtown, said his hotel set aside most of its 900 rooms for World Cup 
fans between June 15 and July 17, but less than 10% were sold through the 
bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the hotel was full on Friday and Saturday, Sarno said he would 
have fared a lot better if his hotel had "a free hand in selling the rooms to 
our own potential customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Jaime Byrom, head of the World Cup Accommodation Bureau, said that his firm 
booked half of the hotel rooms used by soccer fans during the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "No hotel can challenge the fact that thousands of people from all over the 
world came (because of the World Cup)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank Police Chief Dave Newsham said, "I think a lot of people anticipated 
World Cup fans would come and spend the whole month." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added: "for a lot of these games, people blew into town, spent a night 
and left."

VALLEY INTERVIEW; TAKE TIME TO UPDATE HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE, ADVOCATE ADVISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buying home insurance, which used to be a pretty simple proposition for most 
people, has suddenly become complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Many homeowners have discovered since last fall's brush fires and January's 
Northridge earthquake that the coverage they had -- or thought they had -- 
before those disasters was inadequate. Even people fortunate enough to have 
escaped serious damage from the recent disasters have heard horror stories 
about the battles many of their neighbors in the San Fernando Valley are still 
having with their insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which makes this a good time for anyone who owns property in this area 
to review their insurance coverage to see if they need to make changes, says 
John Trapani, a Northridge accountant. 
</P>
<P>
 Trapani knows the importance of the exercise first-hand. The quake caused 
extensive damage to his home, including several cracks in the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 His contractor estimates that repairs to the 2,700-square-foot, four-bedroom 
home will cost more than $500,000. Trapani's insurance company has offered 
$125,000. Meanwhile, the family is living in a trailer in the front yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The frustration of trying to deal with his insurer on his own prompted Trapani 
and his wife, Kathy, to help organize Community Assisting Recovery (CARe) in 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit consumer group, headquartered at 11145 Tampa Ave. in Northridge, 
conducts "carrier specific" meetings for people whose homeowners insurance or 
earthquake coverage are with the same company.  
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of his own struggle to rebuild, Trapani spoke with staff writer 
Jill Bettner last week to share his advice for other homeowners who are 
reassessing what kind and how much insurance they need. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not an insurance expert, but I've learned a lot since Jan. 17," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Question: What happens to me if my insurer gets out of the market?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: A lot of companies are either limiting their new business or limiting 
the types of policies and properties they'll take on. So the number of choices 
people have now is extremely small. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the problems that generates is if you haven't settled with your old 
insurance company to repair your house -- and you no longer have insurance -- 
another company won't come in and cover you until you've done the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 It puts you in the position, if you have a company going out of business, of 
being forced to agree to a settlement that is perhaps unreasonably low, so you 
can qualify for insurance with another carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do I find another carrier?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Go through the Yellow Pages and make a list of all the various agents. Then 
start calling and interviewing them to find out whether they have a product 
that's available. 
</P>
<P>
 If they do, ask them if they'll make a copy of the policy available to you 
before you sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Believe it or not, that's not routine. It's like ordering a new car and three 
weeks later, you expect to get a station wagon and end up with a Yugo. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What if I haven't repaired quake damage yet?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I understand there are a few insurance companies that are writing policies 
based on the condition of the house as it stands. 
</P>
<P>
 That gets very risky for the homeowner, though. If we have another earthquake 
before the house is repaired, who's to say when new damage occurred? 
</P>
<P>
 If a person can find an insurance company to insure on that basis, I'd 
recommend making a detailed list of what the condition of the house is now.  
</P>
<P>
 Get the best policy you can. Then once you get the repairs done, that will 
open up other possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do I figure the kind and amount of insurance I need?  
</P>
<P>
 A: People should be aware on a general basis of the various types of policies 
that are out there. 
</P>
<P>
 There are policies with coverage limits, then there are policies with 
guaranteed replacement costs. Even there, though, you have to be careful there 
isn't some fine print back on page 47 that could take away that guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
 And you have to remember that the market value of the house probably has 
nothing to do with the replacement cost of the house. Replacement cost is what 
it will cost to return the house to its pre-quake condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, in this area even if you do everything exactly right, you can 
still be out quite a bit of money because of the high deductibles on earthquake 
insurance. No other insurance I know of has such high deductibles. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, say a person bought a 2,000-square-foot house 20 years ago for 
$100,000. Before the quake, figuring it might take $100 a square foot to 
replace, the homeowner might have had $200,000 of homeowners coverage. In 
addition, he might have had $200,000 of earthquake coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 This person is probably still not in good shape now. If the quake caused 
extensive damage, the homeowner could easily have a loss of $300,000 or 
$400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But say the deductible on his earthquake insurance was $40,000, or 10% of the 
$400,000. If this person had a $400,000 loss, he's still out of pocket $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, this person did everything he could. But unfortunately in this 
area, even if you do everything exactly perfect, you can still be out a lot of 
money. That's one of the difficult aspects of earthquake insurance.  
</P>
<P>
 It's important that people take a detailed inventory of what is in their house 
now and find out what the replacement cost of those items would be. Then they 
should maintain a detailed inventory to be sure they have adequate coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do I need less coverage because real estate prices have declined?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It's important for people not to confuse the market value of their property 
with the cost of replacing it if they have a claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Replacement cost is what it would cost to return the house to its pre-existing 
condition. That could be very different from the market value. Today, most 
houses would cost more to replace than they could be sold for. 
</P>
<P>
 And earthquake damage can be surprisingly expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 We're talking about a lot of hand work to remove and reset damaged items -- 
take plaster off the wall, strengthen fastenings between the studs and framing 
-- all things that have to be done before you can start putting new drywall on 
wall. There's a lot of preparation, a lot of demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not even counting special aspects of your home, such as wallpaper, 
upgraded moldings, rugs, hardwood floors underneath the rugs. If the hardwood 
floor is uneven, you may have to remove the floor to fix the substructure. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, if only 80% of a person's house was damaged by the earthquake, he 
should consider increasing the size of his policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What kind of coverage is best?  
</P>
<P>
 A: There are lots of things that aren't always covered in a policy like paying 
to bring the house up to current building code, paying for any engineers, 
architects, building permits. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most overlooked items is additional living expense. In the current 
situation, here we are six months out from the earthquake and people are still 
waiting to get settlements from their insurance companies -- living in rented 
houses, trailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if they were able to settle today, depending on their damage, they could 
still be out of their house anywhere from three months to a year.  
</P>
<P>
 Most additional living coverage under earthquake policies only goes out one 
year. Under homeowners, it's usually the same period, but some policies do go 
out as much as two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar amount is usually enough to allow you to maintain the same 
lifestyle. So, if you had a three-bedroom house with a swimming pool, you can 
go out and rent a three-bedroom house with a swimming pool in a similar 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people are doubling up with relatives and their insurance companies are 
paying the extra cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do I protect my home the next time there is a disaster?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Really read your homeowners policy. How many people ever do? 
</P>
<P>
 You need to understand your policy. And it's not necessarily written in such a 
way you can understand it. 
</P>
<P>
 As an accountant, I read a lot of contracts and leases. And there are clauses 
in my insurance policy I didn't understand, especially after I had a loss.  
</P>
<P>
 'The market value of the house probably has nothing to do with the replacement 
cost.'

MISSING GIRL FOUND; MAN ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 15-year-old girl who was the subject of a massive police search was found by 
security guard Monday in a Van Nuys neighborhood, accompanied by a man whom 
police later arrested on suspicion of rape, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, who police said has the mental capacity of a 7-year-old, was found 
about 4:30 p.m. in the 15000 block of Oxnard Avenue by a private security guard 
who saw her walking in an alley with an adult man, said Officer Don Cox of the 
Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Guillermo Perez Ayon, 37, a transient, was being held in lieu of $50,000 bail 
on suspicion of rape of an incompetent person, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 The guard recognized the girl from photographs that had been run on television 
and distributed on 1,300 leaflets along Ventura Boulevard, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 She had walked away from her home in Woodland Hills on Sunday afternoon, 
authorities said. She was last seen Sunday by a store clerk at a bus bench at 
the corner of Corbin Street and Ventura Boulevard between 5 p.m. and 5:30 p.m., 
said Detective Bud Mehringer, juvenile coordinator at the West Valley Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Her disappearance prompted an intense search that began Sunday when 
authorities sent rescue teams equipped with search and tracking dogs into the 
hillside area above her home.

911 CALLS LEAD TO ARREST IN SHOOTING DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 23-year-old man sought as a suspect in the shooting death of a San Fernando 
man was taken into custody without incident Monday after police responded to 
several 911 calls reporting shots being fired, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Elizondo, who also uses the alias Cuautemoc Rivera, among others, was 
arrested at a home in the 700 block of Hollister Street by authorities who 
negotiated his surrender over the phone with a relative at the house, said 
Detective Mike Langston of the San Fernando Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Langston said that Elizondo showed up as an uninvited guest Sunday at a 
baptism where he knew many people. After the ceremony, he caught a ride home 
with Damian Martinez and two other men who rode in the front seat, Langston 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the way back to the Hollister Street home, Elizondo and Martinez argued in 
the car and then climbed out and began fighting in the 600 block of North Brand 
Boulevard at about 10:35 p.m., Langston said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They battled on Brand and then Elizondo pulled out a pistol and shot him," 
Langston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers responded to a call of shots fired and spotted a four-door 
Cadillac fleeing the scene, according to a news release issued by the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers stopped the car, driven by one of the other men, and found Martinez 
in the back seat, but he died before paramedics arrived, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizondo is being held without bail at the San Fernando city jail, authorities 
said.

MAN TO FACE MURDER, GRAND THEFT CHARGES IN DEATH OF ELDERLY CLIENT; CRIME: 
MICHAEL BENANTI LED INVESTIGATORS TO WHAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE THE BURIED REMAINS 
OF JAMES YOUNG, WHO HAD BEEN MISSING SINCE EARLY 1993. 
</P>

<P>
 Michael Benanti of Palmdale will face charges of murder and grand theft in the 
death of 73-year-old James Young, whose remains investigators believe they 
found in a makeshift grave that Benanti led them to over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Arraignment proceedings Monday were continued one week to allow a special 
public defender to represent Benanti, who is being held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 The murder charge includes the special-circumstance allegation of killing for 
financial gain, which allows prosecutors to seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the case is now considered a capital crime, it is undecided if the 
death penalty will be sought, said Sandy Gibbons, a spokesperson for the Los 
Angeles County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities Sunday unearthed human remains near mile marker 6.79 on Lake 
Hughes Road in the Angeles National Forest, after digging where Benanti said he 
had buried Young's body. A coroner's autopsy to determine the cause of death 
will be conducted later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Young had been missing from his Quartz Hill home since he left for a Las Vegas 
vacation in February, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Benanti, who met Young when he began working for a landscaping company that 
mowed grass and watered plants for the elderly man, lived at Young's home for 
nearly a year thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 He told neighbors and investigators that Young had met a woman in Las Vegas 
and abandoned his possessions to move with her to Mexico. Benanti said he had 
been left to deal with the elderly man's business affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Benanti, 35, was arrested Thursday morning at a mobile home park in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewelry, collectible coins and other personal items belonging to Young were 
discovered when search warrants were served at the homes of Benanti's friends 
and relatives in Chatsworth, Canyon Country, Northridge, Palmdale and Simi 
Valley, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors reported that, while Benanti stayed at Young's home, motorcycles, a 
classic Porsche automobile and other valuables on the property began to 
disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, a group of 35 neighbors and friends of Young petitioned the 
Sheriff's Department to renew its investigation into the disappearance.

RELATIVES FEARFUL OVER SIMI MAN, MISSING 12 DAYS; SEARCH: FRANK PLAICE WAS LAST 
SEEN AT THE ELKS LODGE. HIS FRIENDS AND FAMILY SAY HE WOULD NOT HAVE LEFT 
WITHOUT HIS INSULIN AND DENTURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Frank Plaice would never leave his false teeth behind. 
</P>
<P>
 So 12 days after this steady, tidy 57-year-old accountant left his Simi Valley 
condominium with the lights on and his teeth out, relatives say they fear the 
worst. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidnapers or carjackers may have taken Plaice, or his car could have veered 
off the road somewhere, said his ex-wife, Jeanette Plaice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't make a lot of sense," she said. "He comes to work every day for 17 
years and then one day disappears. If he didn't want to do something or if he 
didn't want to go to work, he wouldn't have a problem saying so." 
</P>
<P>
 But no one has tried to use Frank Plaice's credit cards or bank accounts, she 
said, and police say they do not suspect foul play. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaice's friends and family have launched an all-out search, distributing 
flyers and combing roadside canyons from Chatsworth to Ojai by car and plane. 
Despite all this, Jeanette Plaice said: "We haven't a clue." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1971, Frank Plaice has run a small Chatsworth accounting firm that 
caters to about 70 clients, including about 20 Ventura County gas stations, 
friends and family say. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he would visit Ventura County clients in Santa 
Paula, Fillmore, Ojai, Ventura and Simi Valley, a route covering more than 100 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 7, however, Plaice went home feeling sick, said Geraldine Grooms, his 
girlfriend of nearly five years. This was not unusual, she said, because he 
suffered chest pains that a doctor recently had diagnosed as severe 
indigestion. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not go straight home, she said: "I do know that from there he went to 
the carwash, because he was seen at the carwash in Simi Valley at 3:30." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After that, Plaice drove to the Simi Valley Elks Lodge, as he often did in his 
capacity as lodge secretary, to drop off some papers, said Wayne Myers, the 
lodge's grand knight. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers said Plaice talked about the Polish Night dinner planned for the 
following evening, and mentioned something about having to drive to Ojai that 
night.  
</P>
<P>
 "He said he'd see us tomorrow," Myers said, "And he just walked out in his 
normal jovial manner." 
</P>
<P>
 That, his friends and family say, was the last time they saw Frank Plaice. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is way out of character," Myers added. "Everybody's very upset by it. 
Frank's a good man." 
</P>
<P>
 When Grooms called Plaice's office in Chatsworth the next day to firm up plans 
for dinner that night, Jeanette Plaice told her that she was worried about him. 
Calls to his condo only reached his answering machine, she said, and he had not 
kept appointments with clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Grooms drove to his Cochran Street condo late that afternoon and let herself 
in, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lights were left on -- something Plaice never did -- and the car was gone 
from the garage, so Grooms watched TV and waited, thinking he would return. 
</P>
<P>
 "And he didn't come back and he didn't come back," she said. "And then I was 
kind of concerned about where he had gone." 
</P>
<P>
 She went upstairs. Neither clothes nor luggage was missing. 
</P>
<P>
 "His retainer teeth were on the counter," she said. "We've been together 
almost five years, and I have never seen them out. He takes them out to brush 
them, and puts them right back in." 
</P>
<P>
 So were his shaving cream and his toothbrush, which also struck her as odd 
because Plaice is "really mister neatnik -- he puts everything away," she said. 
And Plaice, a diabetic, had left behind his insulin, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grooms called police to report him missing. Police have put out a description 
of Plaice and his white 1994 Ford Probe through the nationwide police computer 
system, said Simi Valley Sgt. Andrew McCluskey. But he added, "Unless something 
new or fresh comes up, there's not a whole lot more at this point we can do 
except keep listening for responses to our Teletypes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Plaice's friends and family have continued the search, even hiring 
psychics who have given wildly conflicting readings about his fate. 
</P>
<P>
 Grooms said one psychic told her she saw no harm coming to Plaice, that he 
just had to get away for a while and would return soon. Another told Plaice's 
daughter, Terry Wolf, that she envisioned two men coming to Plaice's door, 
kidnaping him and killing him for his car. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were prepared to hear that, but we just want to know for sure what has 
happened," said Wolf of Oak View. "This is just so unusual. It's so unlike him. 
He was just here a day before he disappeared, playing with his grandson. I 
don't think he would just leave without telling us." Plaice is described as 
white, about 5 feet, 7 inches tall, weighing 160 pounds, balding with a graying 
beard and mustache. His Ford had California plates, license number 3EML767. 
Anyone with information on his disappearance is asked to call Simi Valley 
police, the family said.

 A Van Nuys man convicted of driving under the influence remains at large after 
apparently scaling a prison fence that had been topped with razor wire. 
</P>
<P>
 Max Arroyo, 27, was discovered missing from the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho 
facility at 5:50 Sunday morning during a routine inmate count, according to 
Deputy Gabe Ramirez. Arroyo was last accounted for during a similar check at 3 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Razor wire had been pulled off the top of a nine-foot fence that surrounds the 
minimum security area where Arroyo was held, Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arroyo was arrested May 28 and had been scheduled to be released Oct. 9.

WOMAN LOSES $1,250 IN ANOTHER LOTTERY TICKET SCAM; CRIME: CANYON COUNTRY 
RESIDENT FALLS VICTIM TO WOMAN WHO CLAIMED SHE COULDN'T CASH HER WINNING 
NUMBERS IN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Canyon Country resident was swindled out of about $1,250 by a woman claiming 
to have a winning lottery ticket and a male accomplice who pretended to be an 
innocent bystander, the second such scam in the area in eight days. 
</P>
<P>
 Lugina Rodriguez, 59, said a woman approached her in a discount store parking 
lot and claimed she had a Fantasy 5 lottery ticket worth $91,000, but could not 
cash it because she was an illegal alien. The woman offered Rodriguez $4,000 
from the winnings to cash it -- but said she wanted all of the money in 
Rodriguez's bank account as collateral for the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was embarrassed for myself and I felt like I had egg on my face because I 
believed it," said Rodriguez, who works as an assembler at a plant in Sylmar. 
"It was like somebody hit me over the head." 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects remain at large, said Lt. Harvey Cantor of the Santa Clarita 
Valley Sheriff's Station. He said numerous similar incidents have occurred in 
Santa Clarita, but estimates that "fewer than half a dozen" have taken place 
within the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects have differed in at least some of the schemes, according to 
sheriff's reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez said she was coming out of the JJ Newberry's store at 19200 Soledad 
Canyon Road at about 4 p.m. Thursday when the woman, a Latino about 45 years 
old, approached and said she was trying to find lawyers who were supposed to be 
providing free services that day at the location. She said she was sick and 
needed medicine, but was in the country illegally and didn't know where she 
could go for help. 
</P>
<P>
 The seemingly distraught woman also said she needed the money from the lottery 
ticket to pay for medical expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 A Latino male in his mid-30s walked up as the two women were talking and said 
he would be glad to help the woman cash the lottery ticket, Rodriguez said. He 
left and returned a few minutes later with what he said was $3,000, handing it 
to the woman, then encouraged Rodriguez to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was very nice," Rodriguez said, adding that both sounded 
convincing. "It was like the movies. They were like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez went to her bank nearby and gave the woman $1,000 of the $1,500 she 
had in her bank account, plus about $250 in her purse. The woman gave Rodriguez 
the ticket, which she later discovered was a non-winning ticket purchased in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman then said she needed prescription medication from a nearby drug 
store, Rodriguez said, and asked the man to get it for her because she was 
feeling ill. The man went into the store first, but said he couldn't get the 
medicine because it was to be prescribed to women only, so Rodriguez went into 
the store instead. 
</P>
<P>
 She came out of the drug store after an employee said no request for the 
medicine had been made and discovered the couple had disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started feeling like I wanted to cry," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone 18 years of age or older is eligible to play the California Lottery and 
claim prizes, including illegal aliens, said Bob Taylor, a lottery spokesman. 
He urged people to avoid propositions from people claiming to have winning 
tickets or to at least verify the ticket with lottery officials or a retailer 
selling the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Such schemes, known as "pigeon drops," are common in Southern California, 
nearly all targeting older people, according to law enforcement officials. A 
culprit typically offers something reportedly of value to a victim in return 
for cash, with a nearby accomplice pretending to be a stranger accepting the 
offer enthusiastically and persuading the victim to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 A 72-year-old widow was swindled out of her $800 life savings and jewelry July 
6 by two men, one of whom was trying to unload bars he claimed were made of 
gold, according to a sheriff's report. The second man, pretending to be a 
bystander, "bought" one of the bars for $10,000 and convinced the widow to buy 
a second bar for whatever she could pay, and they could sell the bars to a K 
mart store for $20,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 The bars turned out to be made of brass. K mart employees said they would 
never agree to such a sale, even if the bars were gold.

GROUND IS BROKEN FOR OUTLET MALL; BUSINESS: OFFICIALS TAKE PART IN CEREMONY 
THEY HOPE IS FIRST STEP TO BRINGING JOBS AND INCREASING TAX REVENUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 City officials gathered on a large dirt lot Monday to take part in 
ground-breaking ceremonies for a factory outlet shopping mall that is expected 
to bring new jobs and sales-tax dollars to Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer, Yehuda Netanel, president of Woodland Hills-based California 
Factory Stores, said he's banking on an "aggressive" construction schedule to 
get more than half the mall built in time to be open for the Christmas shopping 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The first phase will contain about 40 stores, with another 20 to 25 to open 
before next summer. Netanel declined Monday to discuss which merchants have 
signed up to occupy the mall. But in April he announced that tentative tenants 
include Brooks Brothers, Bass, Carole Little, Jockey, Jones New York, Oshkosh, 
JH Collectibles, Van Heusen and Geoffrey Beene. 
</P>
<P>
 At factory outlet malls, merchants generally sell overstocked, discontinued 
and slightly flawed goods, as well as first-quality items at discount prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Netanel said he believes the outlet mall, to be built on Lancaster Boulevard 
just west of the Antelope Valley Freeway, will draw bargain hunters from a 
large area, including the San Fernando Valley and more distant parts of Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials, who want to create local jobs and increase sales-tax revenue 
to pay for parks, law enforcement and other services, hope the mall is as 
successful as the developer predicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something we've really been looking forward to," Councilman Henry 
Hearns said during the ceremony. "We expect this to present some 400 jobs for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman George Runner added that the mall will probably generate $600,000 
to $700,000 a year in sales-tax revenue for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 To move the project forward, the City Council last year voted to sell the 
24-acre site to Netanel and gave him a 20-year loan to help pay for it. The 
council approved other financial incentives, such as building a road to serve 
the mall and using redevelopment funds to pay developer fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Although council members said the project will give a boost to the city's 
sluggish economy, some local residents and merchants criticized the deal, 
charging that Lancaster officials were using tax dollars to aid a mall that 
might put existing shops out of business.

OXNARD COUNCIL TO CONSIDER PITCHING SOME OLD CITY FILES; GOVERNMENT: THE 
PROPOSAL WOULD CHANGE CURRENT PROCEDURE. STORING 7,000 BOXES OF DOCUMENTS COSTS 
THE PACK RAT RECORD KEEPERS $43,000 YEARLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Paperwork can truly become a burden -- just ask Oxnard officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's record keepers have been such pack rats that Oxnard has 7,000 boxes 
of documents dating back to its incorporation in 1903, most of which has to be 
stored and managed by a private company. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the city now spends about $43,000 a year to store old agendas, 
reports, newspaper clippings and other paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Even allowing for public records laws that require some documents to be kept 
for five years or more, much of Oxnard's records could be pitched, officials 
say, and the City Council today will consider a proposal to send piles of old 
papers to the recycling bin. 
</P>
<P>
 The source of the problem is that destroying city records currently requires 
City Council approval. Most city departments end up keeping everything due to 
the tedium of preparing detailed listings of records to be destroyed for 
council examination. 
</P>
<P>
 Some departments have been saving magazines, brochures and equipment manuals 
for years. 
</P>
<P>
 The new plan would allow departments to throw away most documents themselves. 
Disposal of records classified as significant would have to be approved by the 
city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 And to ensure that important papers are saved as long as is legally required, 
records of the records would be kept. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard recently hired a private consulting firm to supervise the city's summer 
cleaning and give advice on future record keeping. Savage Information Systems 
of Los Angeles prepared extensive schedules for each city department, reminding 
them which papers need to be saved and how long they should be kept. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times people store things because they don't know what else to do 
with them," City Clerk Daniel Martinez said. "This will prevent that kind of 
thing from taking place." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new plan, City Council agendas would be saved for two years, budget 
files three years, deed files five years, and agreements 20 years after they 
are void. City Council minutes, along with maps, drawings and anything deemed 
to have historical value, would be saved permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 The city keeps most of its old papers at York Business Records in Oxnard, a 
large warehouse complex which stores truckloads of paperwork for area 
companies. In addition to the yearly fee, York charges the city a fee every 
time workers move a box from the company's Gargantuan stacks. 
</P>
<P>
 To reduce the amount of paperwork in storage, thousands of boxes would have to 
be taken down so their contents can be evaluated and thrown away, a process 
that would cost the city thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will cost money at first," acknowledged Martinez, "But it will save money 
in the long run. If you have a box sitting in storage 10 years that should have 
been thrown away five years ago, you're wasting a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Scouring the records for what should be kept and what should be thrown away 
could take years. But each department would eventually know when boxes in 
storage could be destroyed, and storage fees would be cut to about $25,000, 
Martinez said.

CLAS STRUGGLE; NEW STUDENT ASSESSMENT EXAMS GET POOR MARKS ON READERS' REPORT 
CARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 Sinister rumors about the state's new CLAS exams have circulated in Ventura 
County since spring, but the real thing was in Camarillo on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 And some people who have been opposed to the test all along said it confirmed 
their worst fears. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I've read so far, it sounds like they're trying to get the students 
on the psychiatrist's couch," said Steward Mimm, a retired advertising agent 
from Ventura who had just looked over a literature selection from the 
eighth-grade test. 
</P>
<P>
 Mimm was one of dozens of county residents who converged Monday on the county 
superintendent of schools' office in Camarillo, where portions of the CLAS 
exams will be available for review for one month. 
</P>
<P>
 Eager to test rumor against reality, many of Monday's visitors came within two 
hours of the curriculum display center's 9 a.m. opening. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard such negative reports about this," said Joy Gloyd, a Ventura 
grandmother who came with her daughter-in-law to review the tests Monday 
morning. "I wanted to see it for myself." 
</P>
<P>
 After reading several exams, Gloyd said she failed to understand why some 
reading tests asked students to draw images depicting their reaction to 
literature selections. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does that teach?" Gloyd said. "I think it's a waste of the taxpayers' 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 But state education officials are hoping the opportunity to view the CLAS 
exams will help quell such opposition. The display of the tests, which is 
taking place at 50 sites around the state, marks the first time the California 
Department of Education has made any of its statewide student assessment exams 
available to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Because educators will have to rewrite all portions of the tests that the 
public sees to protect the exam's integrity, only the most controversial 
sections are on display. 
</P>
<P>
 The math and social science exams are being kept under cover, but the reading 
and writing parts of exams that were given this spring to fourth-, eighth- and 
10th-grade students across the state are available for review. 
</P>
<P>
 Each test booklet includes a short literature selection that is used as a 
basis for a series of essay-type questions. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS critics have assailed the tests for including readings, such as excerpts 
from the Richard Wright autobiographical novel "Black Boy," with violent or 
disturbing images, but state education officials have said they deliberately 
selected literature that would provoke responses from students. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea is it's an assessment of critical thinking skills, so it has 
to be something that will invoke your interest and cause you to think 
creatively," state Department of Education spokeswoman Mary Lou Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the aim of the tests is to provoke, they hit their target Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as Karen Koch finished reading an excerpt from "Black Boy" in an 
eighth-grade test booklet, she burst into tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too real," Koch said. "I don't think it needs to be in there. It hits 
too close to home." 
</P>
<P>
 In the excerpt from Wright's book, the author recounts how his mother, 
distraught after being left by her husband, gives him a big stick to fight off 
bullies in the neighborhood. He cracks the stick against the skulls of the some 
local gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives kids the wrong idea," said Koch, a Ventura resident who came to the 
CLAS display with several fellow members of a politically conservative group 
called Concerned Women of America. "It makes him a hero for beating everyone 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 Although many of the viewers Monday were from west county cities, Thousand 
Oaks resident Karen McLaine said some CLAS opponents from her city plan to look 
at the test today. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an important issue in terms of parental rights and privacy between the 
parents and the child and the school," McLaine said. "Many of the questions are 
invasive of family privacy." 
</P>
<P>
 Some viewers Monday objected that many of the reading excerpts were about 
minorities. State education officials, however, said at least as many white 
characters are in the stories as minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Others complained that most of the stories, however realistic, were 
depressing. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the stuff is true," said Debbie Gloyd, Joy's daughter-in-law. "But 
it's still negative. There hasn't been a happy, fun story in the bunch." 
</P>
<P>
 Although many of the people who viewed the test Monday said they opposed the 
aim of CLAS -- to ask students open-ended questions -- Gloyd said she supports 
such essay-type assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these techniques are good," she said. She added, however, "They'd be 
good in a small classroom, but not in a statewide test." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gloyd was one of only a few to find something positive to say about the 
revolutionary method of assessment that CLAS represents. 
</P>
<P>
 The open-ended questions -- including some that ask students to relate a 
particular reading to their own lives -- smacked more of psychology than 
English, some viewers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Cascia, a manager of a Ventura equipment rental company, said he believes 
CLAS represents an effort by the government to take control of children away 
from families. "It's just the government's way of picking our children's brains 
to find out (what they are thinking)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But state education spokeswoman Schmidt said asking students to write about 
their own lives is nothing new in the public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The CLAS questions "are no more invasive than asking students to write about 
their summer vacations," she said. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The reading and writing sections of the 1993-94 California Learning Assessment 
System exams for fourth, eighth and 10th grades can be viewed through Aug. 12 
at the Ventura County Superintendent of Schools' educational services center, 
570 Airport Way, Camarillo. The center is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays. 
In addition to the exams, copies of some students' answers are available. 
Viewers may request photocopies at 10 cents per page, except the literature 
selections, which are protected by copyright laws. For more information, call 
the superintendent's office at 388-4408.

PLISKY FORSAKES COUNCIL FOR TRY AT HARBOR DISTRICT; ELECTIONS: MEANWHILE, 
DOZENS OF CANDIDATES TAKE OUT NOMINATION PAPERS FOR OPEN SEATS ON COUNTY'S 
SCHOOL BOARDS, SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND CITY COUNCILS.

<P>
 Eight-year Councilman Michael A. Plisky will forsake a third term on the 
Oxnard City Council, instead turning his political ambition to the Oxnard 
Harbor District. 
</P>
<P>
 Plisky's surprise announcement came as dozens of candidates took out 
nomination papers Monday to qualify for open seats on school boards, special 
districts and city councils throughout Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could play a vital role in overseeing the future plans to expand the 
harbor, creating a strong relationship with the regional airport at Point Mugu 
. . . and enhancing the tourism industry," Plisky said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 In the news release, Plisky cited his support of term limits as the primary 
reason for not seeking reelection. The veteran council member ran 
unsuccessfully for mayor three times. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not return phone calls Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Manuel Lopez said Plisky's announcement was unexpected. "I just figured 
he would be running again," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 But "this is not a good time to be serving on any council or public office," 
he said. "The economy is so bad and the resources we have to work with are very 
limited. I guess people just get burnt out." 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard Harbor District, which employs 24 workers administered by a board 
of commissioners, operates the Port Hueneme wharf, which unloads more than 
650,000 tons of fruit, cars and other products each year, officials said. 
Commissioners are paid a $600-a-month stipend plus health benefits and life 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents Stanley Daily, Raymond Fossee and Edward Millan all face reelection 
this fall, but none has yet pulled papers. 
</P>
<P>
 County election officials were swamped Monday with would-be candidates seeking 
applications to launch their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the busiest filing day that I can remember," said Jenny Harrison, a 
deputy county clerk. "They were just filling the counter from early this 
morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who would serve their cities, school boards and special districts have 
four weeks to gather at least 20 signatures and return the completed filing 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
 In west Ventura County, every city but Ventura has several seats open on their 
councils. Also, each school district but those in the city of Ventura have a 
number of governing boards seats that will be decided this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 By the close of business Monday, dozens of candidates had taken out papers 
from city clerks' offices and at county elections for the councils, special 
districts and school boards. 
</P>
<P>
 The races for mayor and two seats on the Oxnard City Council will likely be 
among the most competitive in west Ventura County, if the number of nomination 
papers taken out Monday is any indication. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Lockwood, an unflinching critic at weekly meetings who routinely berates 
the decisions of council members and staff recommendations, has been running 
for the Oxnard City Council for years. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the first to take out papers Monday, waiting outside City Hall at 7:30 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot to be done in the city because it's been managed so poorly," 
Lockwood said. "We're in debt and they just keep on with their wasteful 
spending." 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Lockwood in taking out papers Monday for a council seat were retired 
city employee John C. Zaragoza, retired aerospace engineer Fred J. Schwartz and 
Deborah DeMoss. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Thomas E. Holden did not take out papers Monday, but said he will 
run again. 
</P>
<P>
 But Anthony De La Cerda, a 24-year-old television producer who also works at 
the Oxnard Boys & Girls Club, will run for mayor. Mayor Manuel M. Lopez 
welcomed the seemingly high number of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "That shows there's a lot of interest for the council," said Lopez, who said 
Monday that he intends to seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 "When times are good and you're getting more revenue, it's a little more fun," 
Lopez said. "But the last four years we've cut more and more, so it's a very 
difficult time to be a public servant." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the other council races in west Ventura County have drawn few 
surprises. 
</P>
<P>
 In Camarillo, only Councilwoman Charlotte Craven took out papers on Monday. 
But Mayor Ken Gose and incumbent Councilman Stanley J. Daily, also of the 
Oxnard Harbor District, have both said they would run. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai Councilman Steve Olsen took out papers on Monday. His colleagues Nina V. 
Shelley and Mayor Joe DeVito also face reelection, but DeVito has not said 
whether he will run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't completed my work on Weldon Canyon and the city faces a lot of 
other challenges right now," Shelley said Monday. "I think I have support in 
the community, so I'll take out my papers (Tuesday) and see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 The four-year terms of incumbents John Melton, Margaret Ely and Wayne Johnson 
of the Santa Paula City Council all expire this fall. Johnson and Melton took 
out papers Monday, but Ely did not. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore Councilman Don Gunderson said he would not run again so he could 
spend more time with his family. Mayor Linda Brewster, whose term also expires, 
was the only other candidate to take out papers Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme residents Robert Turner and Jon Sharkey tossed their hats in for 
three seats on the council in that beachside city. Incumbents Ken Hess, Dorill 
Wright and James Daniels have yet to begin reelection bids. 
</P>
<P>
 Four people filed for seats on the Ventura County Community College District: 
Appointed incumbent Karen Boone, former administrator John Tallman, Jim Hibbs 
and Annette B. Burrows. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Gregory P. Cole said he will not run again, instead challenging for 
the Thousand Oaks council. But his colleague Pete Tafoya has said he would. 
</P>
<P>
 With three seats open and only two incumbents running, the Thousand Oaks City 
Council race could be the liveliest among the east Ventura County elections, 
attracting as many as two dozen candidates. 
</P>

 Candidates in municipal elections have until 5 p.m. on Aug. 12 to file 
petitions to get their names on the ballot. They must collect at least 20, but 
no more than 30, signatures from registered voters. If an incumbent fails to 
file, the deadline will be extended five days, to Aug. 17. The election will be 
held Nov. 8, and the last day to register to vote is Oct. 10.

SUPERVISORS SEEK CUTBACK STRATEGY; BUDGET: LEADERS LOOKING FOR THE RIGHT 
COMBINATION OF CUTS AND RESERVE SPENDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 Ventura County leaders would have to slash as many 124 jobs from county 
government to keep their promise to spare law enforcement from further cuts and 
still eliminate a budget deficit approaching $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Or they could cover the entire deficit by hitting their $23.5-million reserve 
fund and avoid the painful cuts altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Tempting as that alternative sounds, all five members of the Board of 
Supervisors said Monday they have no intention of wiping out most of their 
reserves in a single year. Rather, they are looking for the right combination 
of budget cuts and reserve spending to balance the 1994-95 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 They hope to make this year's reductions part of a three-year downsizing plan 
that could reduce the budget in an orderly fashion and eliminate the panic that 
has overtaken county government every July in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a better approach than whacking off the top, and that's what we'd be 
doing" under an 18% cut proposed for most county agencies, Supervisor John K. 
Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under that proposal, officials said Monday, the county's poorest residents 
would lose access to cataract operations or dialysis treatment. Six parks could 
be shut down. And a program helping war veterans could be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the criminal justice departments would be spared in the reductions, which 
could save some $9 million to $12 million in spending while eliminating the 124 
jobs. Last year's budget cuts, which affected public safety workers, sliced 200 
jobs from the county payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the deep cuts proposed, the supervisors would still not reach their 
goal of cutting $15 million from the $880-million spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where is the rest of the money going to come from?" Supervisor Maria 
VanderKolk asked. "How are we going to get through this without touching public 
safety?" 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the board pledged to spend $24 million in Proposition 172 sales tax 
revenue to expand the criminal justice agencies, chiefly the sheriff's and 
district attorney's offices. That money, combined with $83 million in county 
funds already committed to public safety, would restore all cuts made to the 
departments since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, faced with $10 million in unexpected state cuts, some board members want 
to reduce spending for the criminal justice agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sheriff Larry Carpenter and Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury argue that the 
supervisors would be breaching the trust of the voters, who approved 
Proposition 172 with the understanding that the money would be spent only on 
public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn agrees with that reasoning. "I think the voters have told us what to 
do," he said after Monday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 But his colleagues argue that without any cuts from public safety, the rest of 
the county agencies would have to bear 18% cuts. That could mean: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ventura County Medical Center would take its $1-million cut in services to 
the poor. Low-income patients would no longer receive open-heart surgery, 
cataract operations or dialysis treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Recreational Services would close or begin charging fees at six local parks, 
including Saticoy, Oak View, El Rio, Casitas Springs, Piru and Nyeland Acres. 
Six larger parks could close or be leased to private agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Animal Regulation Department would shut down its Simi Valley Holding 
Facility and cut the workers who now handle livestock, marine mammal and 
wildlife calls. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Public Social Services Agency would shut down its veteran services 
office and eliminate the four staff jobs there. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Medical Examiner's office would lay off four of its nine employees, 
including two coroner investigators and two workers on the pathology staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can we exempt public safety, when at the same time we are decimating the 
other departments?" Supervisor Maggie Kildee asked Monday. She said later she 
is undecided whether public safety cuts will be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "That," said Supervisor Vicky Howard, "is going to be the last resort, as far 
as I'm concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors urged budget analysts to come forward with information on a 
variety of alternatives, including offering early retirement and reduced health 
benefits for county employees; folding smaller agencies into larger 
departments; and sending workers home for three to four days without pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors will receive information on these proposals today, along with 
details of a possible three-year downsizing plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Under that proposal, proposed by Flynn, board members would direct agencies to 
reduce spending to a certain level or cut entire programs over a period of 
time. By dipping into reserve funds in the meantime, the cuts could be done in 
a "thoughtful and humane" fashion, Flynn said.

ARRAIGNMENT POSTPONED FOR BOY CHARGED IN SHOOTING; COURTS: DEFENSE ATTORNEY 
SAYS 17-YEAR-OLD THOUSAND OAKS YOUTH IS DISTRAUGHT AND UNDER SUICIDE WATCH AT 
JUVENILE HALL. JUDGE RESCHEDULES THE HEARING DATE FOR AUG. 9. 
</P>

<P>
 A 17-year-old Thousand Oaks boy charged with shooting his girlfriend while 
brandishing a handgun is distraught and under suicide watch at Juvenile Hall, 
his attorney said Monday, after a judge agreed to postpone the defendant's 
arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
 "This young man has been severely traumatized," defense attorney Victor Furio 
said outside court. "He is very concerned about the victim's family. One of the 
reasons for the continuance of this trial is so I can gain his full 
cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
 The husky boy sat hunched over the defense table as Superior Court Judge 
Steven Z. Perren asked if he would agree to waive his rights to a speedy 
arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," the boy replied softly. 
</P>
<P>
 His parents sat behind him in the first row of the audience. They did not talk 
during the hearing, other than to identify themselves at the request of the 
judge. They left the Hall of Justice without comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The arraignment was rescheduled for Aug. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Furio said the three additional weeks will give the defendant time to regain 
his composure and assist in his own defense. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the boy is in a virtual state of shock over the killing of his 
girlfriend, Jacqueline Reay, 16. In their only conversation, the boy has been 
cooperative but appeared unable to cope with the weight of accidentally 
shooting his girlfriend, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult with his present state of mind for him to completely focus on 
his trial," said Furio, a Woodland Hills lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy is charged with one count of murder in connection with last 
Wednesday's shooting death of Jacqueline. She was shot once in the eye with a 
9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun at point-blank range. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the boy swiped the gun from his father and had been flashing 
it in front of his friends for two days prior to the shooting. He also faces 
two counts of brandishing a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
 Furio, who believes the boy should have been charged with the lesser offense 
of involuntary manslaughter, said he did not know how long his client would be 
watched for possible suicide attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a young man who is caught in a drama that was totally accidental," he 
said. "Already, he has been stigmatized as a murderer" by prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted of second-degree murder in Juvenile Court, as prosecutors want, 
he could be kept in California Youth Authority custody for nearly eight years, 
until he reaches age 25. 
</P>
<P>
 He would face a longer, mandatory sentence of 15 years to life in state prison 
if convicted in adult court. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, a defense attorney in another high-profile juvenile case questioned 
a prosecutors' decision against seeking an adult prosecution of the boy. John 
E. Meyers represents 16-year-old William Huang of Rowland Heights -- one of 
three 16-year-old boys charged in connection with a February shooting near 
Westlake High School in which three students were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers criticized prosecutors for filing the motion that led to his client 
being transferred to adult court, noting that he is not only younger than the 
boy accused of shooting Jacqueline but also charged with a lesser offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our case, nobody has any criminal history, as far as I know, and nobody 
had any intent to kill," Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors on Monday stood by their decision against trying the boy who 
allegedly shot Jacqueline as an adult. They said, as they had earlier, that the 
boy apparently did not intend to kill Jacqueline and that he has never before 
had any trouble with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, they acknowledged that it was unusual for them not to seek an adult 
prosecution against anyone who is at least 16 and charged with murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses have told authorities that the boy had been menacing people in the 
Las Casitas neighborhood where the shooting occurred for two days prior to the 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald C. Glynn, however, said the boy apparently was only 
trying to attract attention to himself by playing with the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe it was a practical joke gone awry," the prosecutor commented. 
</P>
<P>
 Glynn said he believed he could get a jury conviction if the case were to be 
tried in adult court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most people would be outraged with his conduct," Glynn said.

FIRST DAY OF FILING MARKS THE OPENING OF CAMPAIGN SEASON; ELECTIONS: THE 
THOUSAND OAKS COUNCIL RACE IS EXPECTED TO DRAW UP TO TWO DOZEN CANDIDATES. 
SIMILARLY HEATED CONTESTS ARE LIKELY IN SIMI VALLEY AND MOORPARK. 
</P>

<P>
 By lunchtime on Monday afternoon, Thousand Oaks City Clerk Nancy Dillon was 
pooped. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign season had officially started -- and so had campaign headaches. 
</P>
<P>
 One by one, hopeful candidates trooped into her office to pick up nomination 
papers and leaf through a red, white and blue election manual. Dillon gave them 
all the same speech, explaining again and again the city's rules about 
contribution limits, filing deadlines and campaign ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, lord," Dillon groaned, after repeating the same spiel for six potential 
candidates. "I went nonstop from 8:15 a.m. to 12:30 -- I was exhausted." 
</P>
<P>
 With three seats open, and only two incumbents running, the Thousand Oaks 
council race is expected to draw up to two dozen candidates. Similarly heated 
races are likely in Simi Valley and Moorpark -- in each city, two city council 
positions plus the mayoral seat are up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the municipal races, east county voters will select 
representatives to school boards, park districts, water districts and the 
community college board. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Valley Unified School District has three seats open, including one 
vacated by William Henry Jr., who has moved out of the area. And ballots in 
Moorpark and Simi Valley will each include races for two school board 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Electioneering kicked off Monday morning, with the official start of the 
monthlong filing period. A dozen candidates in the three east county cities 
pulled papers for the council and mayoral elections, signaling their interest 
in running. 
</P>
<P>
 To become registered candidates, they must collect at least 20 signatures from 
local voters by Aug. 12. Those petitions must then be validated, and the 
candidates must swear oaths of allegiance. 
</P>
<P>
 But few wait for that formality to begin campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
 Eager to begin kissing babies and shaking hands -- not to mention raising 
money -- the would-be politicians in all three cities have planned rallies and 
press conferences, and even a golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never understood why people are timid about saying they want to run 
for public office," Thousand Oaks council candidate Andy Fox said. "I wanted to 
file as soon as possible, to get started right away, to get out and meet the 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 In Moorpark, Mayor Paul Lawrason agreed. Running for his third term as mayor, 
he dropped by City Hall at 8:30 a.m. Monday to pick up his nomination papers, 
determined to be among the first candidates to file. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always done that," Lawrason said, "I just want to make it apparent to 
everyone that I'm interested." 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one has yet pulled papers to challenge him, Lawrason said he's 
gearing up for a race: "Moorpark," he said, "has always managed to come up with 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a rundown of other candidates who trekked to their city clerk's office 
Monday: 
</P>
<P>
 * In Moorpark, Councilman John Wozniak joined Mayor Lawrason in pulling papers 
to run for reelection. Councilman Bernardo Perez's term also ends in November. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Simi Valley, three challengers have pulled papers to run for two City 
Council seats. Former Simi Valley Police Chief Paul Miller and residents 
Douglas Dubin and Joseph Vesalga all launched their campaigns Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Sandi Webb has indicated she will run for reelection. But 
Councilwoman Judy Mikels has given up a shot at reelection to run for county 
supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters in Simi Valley will also pick a mayor in November. Mayor Greg Stratton 
has indicated that he will seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Thousand Oaks, six challengers and an incumbent pulled papers: dentist 
and community college trustee Greg Cole; mortgage and real estate broker 
Michael Friedman; firefighter Andy Fox; Councilwoman Judy Lazar; homicide 
detective Mike Markey; engineer David Seagal, and mobile car wash owner Lance 
Winslow. 
</P>
<P>
 With Councilman Alex Fiore retiring this fall after 30 years in service, the 
council will have one open seat. Lazar and Councilwoman Elois Zeanah are also 
up for reelection, and both have indicated they will run. A fourth seat could 
open if Schillo wins his supervisor's race. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly elected council would have to decide whether to appoint someone to 
fill that seat, hold a special election, or designate the fourth-place finisher 
in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the east county elections, every city in the west county except 
Ventura will be holding council elections. More than 20 special districts and 
school boards will also have races, and the campaigning has already started. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard's race could be one of the most lively, as four candidates have already 
taken out papers for two council seats, while one challenger has so far 
promised to vie for the mayor's post. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, veteran Oxnard Councilman Michael A. Plisky made a surprise 
announcement Monday that he will not run for a third term on the council, but 
instead will launch a campaign for a seat on the city's harbor district. 
</P>
<P>
 Times correspondent Jeff McDonald contributed to this story. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates in local elections have until 5 p.m. on Aug. 12 to file petitions 
to get their names on the ballot. They must collect at least 20, but no more 
than 30, signatures from registered voters. If an incumbent fails to file, the 
deadline will be extended five days, to Aug. 17. The election will be held Nov. 
8, and the last day to register to vote is Oct. 10.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; BOYS & GIRLS CLUB SEEKS OK FOR EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With some 2,000 children from the Camarillo area crowding into the Camarillo 
Boys & Girls Club for summer and after-school diversion, the gymnasium is 
packed and space to run and play is at a premium, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Club officials and organizers hope to change all that when they ask the 
Camarillo Planning Commission tonight to approve a $1.3-million renovation and 
expansion of the 21-year-old facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have too many kids and don't know what to do with them," said Jay 
Grigsby, the club's executive director. "It seems that we are literally 
bursting at the seams." 
</P>
<P>
 Club officials want permission to expand the games room, build a new snack bar 
and eating area, add a new computer lab and renovate the learning center. They 
also hope to build new restrooms and a community / teen-age meeting room, 
Grigsby said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other plans call for a new theater area, kitchen and storage rooms. 
Additionally, plans call for new administrative office space and the 41 
additional parking spaces at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 A canopy would be built over the building's Ponderosa Drive entrance and a new 
entrance would be constructed on its southeast corner. In total an additional 
1,830 square feet of space would be added to the building. Another 1,720 square 
feet of existing space in the facility would be furnished and used for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
 City planning department staff members are recommending that the commission 
approve the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the commission, construction could start next April, depending 
on how successful fund-raising efforts are. Construction is expected to take 
about eight months. 
</P>
<P>
 Grigsby said a fund-raising campaign has collected about $600,000 toward the 
$1.3-million goal. He said club officials want to eventually raise an 
additional $1 million to maintain the facilities and programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion is necessary because of the area's growing dependence on the 
Boys & Girls Club for youth activities, Grigsby said. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the school systems cutting back in their cultural enrichment programs 
the club has become a viable alternative," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission meeting begins at 7:30 p.m. at City Hall, 601 Carmen Drive.

abused children took in its first charges Monday -- seven boys and girls who 
could remain at the center for months, a staff member said. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven Ventura County youngsters are not the scared victims of a recent 
episode of abuse.Those children will start arriving next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, these youngsters have a history of foster care and have suffered abuse 
which led to their placement in residential programs. One boy who arrived 
Monday had been in 13 homes or centers before coming to Casa Pacifica, 
spokeswoman Tanya Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the center opened, the county did not have ample space to keep them 
locally. Set in an open field near Camarillo State Hospital, the facility will 
provide space for 24 of those youths. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining 50 beds at the center will serve as an emergency shelter for 
children removed from their parents after incidents of violence or neglect. 
Those youngsters will stay two to 45 days, shelter officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Those in the residential program could remain as long as 1 1/2 years, learning 
in the private school there and meeting with mental health counselors. Often, 
these children suffer emotional problems or learning disabilities, officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, the county paid $3.9 million to keep 163 children in 
residential care, according to the county Public Social Services Agency. The 
county also had to pay travel expenses for families and social workers who 
visited them. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; LAWYER CONVICTED OF FELONY GRAND THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael E. Wooten, a Camarillo lawyer who once tried to promote a card-club 
casino in Oxnard, was convicted Monday of one count of felony grand theft in 
Ventura County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The theft charged stemmed from a private construction deal unrelated to the 
casino proposal, which was later rejected by the city of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict, by a jury in Judge Allan Steele's courtroom, marked Wooten's 
second criminal conviction in recent months. In April, Wooten and a business 
partner, 48-year-old Frank Marasco of Ventura, pleaded guilty to one 
misdemeanor count of money laundering in connection with small contributions to 
some Oxnard political campaigns. Each was fined $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Marasco has also been implicated in the construction deal. He is set to go on 
trial Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say the men submitted a false $10,000 voucher to a consortium of 
Ventura County investors for work on a Santa Paula development project. Instead 
of paying a construction firm to supervise the job, Wooten and Marasco divided 
the money between themselves, prosecutors charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys have contended that the pair supervised the project 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff G. Bennett said Monday that the jury found that the 
men intentionally tried to defraud the lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooten faces up to three years in prison, but Bennett would not say whether 
prosecutors would actually recommend that he go to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Wooten nor his attorney could be reached for comment. DWAYNE BRAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: BOARD TO CONSIDER PRINCIPAL'S FIRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A special meeting to determine whether a former candidate for county 
superintendent of schools was legally fired is scheduled today, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Board of Education will hear the opinion of the Ventura 
County Counsel on whether Supt.Charles Weis acted within his authority when he 
terminated Dan Flynn's contract effective July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The county board will meet at 5 p.m. today in the new offices of the county 
Superintendent of Schools at 5189 Verdugo Way in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting, which is open to the public, is expected to draw supporters of 
Flynn, a former principal who was fired after challenging the county schools 
superintendent for election. 
</P>
<P>
 The June 23 firing came less than three weeks after the June 7 election, when 
Flynn lost to Weis in the race for superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 As principal of the county's three schools for juvenile offenders, Flynn was 
employed by the county schools office. Weis was his boss. 
</P>
<P>
 Weis said at the time the firing was based solely on Flynn's job performance, 
not on Flynn's campaign against his supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 But Flynn's attorney and some of his supporters have challenged the firing 
arguing that only the board, not the superintendent, has the right to make such 
personnel decisions. MAIA DAVIS

COUNCIL OKS FUNDS FOR RETROFIT DESIGNS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura will spend $210,000 on designs aimed at earthquake-proofing five 
street bridges and underpasses, council members decided Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The engineering contract commissions redesign sketches of the Sanjon 
Underpass, the Main Street Bridge over the Ventura River, the Seaward Avenue 
underpass, the Vista Del Mar overpass, and the Telephone Road overpass. 
</P>
<P>
 Money to pay for the designs comes from gas tax revenues targeted specifically 
for transportation and street improvements, said Rick Raives, a city engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans has agreed to pay for all of the seismic retrofitting, except the 
Telephone Road overpass, which the agency maintains is not in urgent need of 
repair. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff members say commissioning the sketches now will speed up the 
retrofitting process, which could take years if they waited for Caltrans to 
find money for the engineers' drawings. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is commissioning sketches for the Telephone Road overpass even though 
Caltrans has said it will not pay for the retrofitting, Raives said. The city 
hopes to persuade Caltrans to pay for the work. If not, Raives said the city 
will have to decide if it wants to go forward. CONSTANCE SOMMER

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; TRAILER RENT CONTROL MAY BE EXTENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to protect mobile home owners until the turn of the century, Thousand 
Oaks City Council members tonight will vote on extending a rent-control law 
through the fall of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 Most council members have already signaled their support for the measure, 
which limits yearly rent increases for the city's 980 mobile home owners to 
slightly below the inflation rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Park owners can raise rents to market rate only when a spot becomes vacant -- 
that is, when a mobile home is removed from the park, leaving an empty berth. 
Landlords cannot raise rents when a new tenant moves into an existing mobile 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's rent stabilization law, first adopted in 1980, is due to expire at 
the end of October. The council will vote on a five-year extension, after a 
public hearing starting at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to continue (rent control) to make sure people are not literally 
thrown out of their homes," Councilman Frank Schillo said. "When you start 
raising rent on people who have fixed incomes, they're in real trouble."

 A 35-year-old Newbury Park woman was killed after the car she was riding in 
struck a parked car, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Tognetti died of massive internal injuries at Los Robles Regional 
Medical Center at 6:45 p.m. Sunday, about two hours after her companion, 
Michael Rowland, lost control of the car he was driving in a Newbury Park 
residential neighborhood, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair were going north on Wendy Drive north of Ruth Drive when Rowland lost 
control of his sports car and broadsided a parked car, California Highway 
Patrol Officer Staci Morse said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators do not know how fast Rowland was driving, Morse said. Rowland, 
29, of Newbury Park, suffered minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Morse said Rowland was not under the influence of any drugs or alcohol. The 
accident is still being investigated, and authorities have not decided whether 
to file charges, she said. PEGGY Y. LEE

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CONEJO VALLEY; SCHOOL BOARD SEAT OPEN UNTIL ELECTION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The now vacant seat of a retired Conejo Valley Unified School District Board 
member will remain open until the November general election, district officials 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A member of the school board for nearly nine years, William Henry Jr. resigned 
July 1 after moving to Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of his announcement, district officials were uncertain whether to 
hold a special election, appoint a replacement or leave the seat empty. The 
seat is up for election this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura County election officials Monday told Supt. Jerry Gross that 
according to the state education code, the district can simply leave Henry's 
seat open until the next general election. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board doesn't have to take a vote on this," Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Dorothy Beaubien agreed that the seat should remain open. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we'll fill it, because the election is so close," she said. "We 
all sort of had the same feeling that it would be foolish." 
</P>
<P>
 Three seats for the Conejo Valley school board are up for reelection in the 
fall: Henry's and those held by trustees Mildred Lynch and Richard Newman.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; SCHOOL OFFICIAL QUITS TO ASSUME NEW 
POST

<TEXT>
<P>
 An administrator at the Simi Valley Unified School District has resigned to 
take a position as superintendent of an 1,100-student district in central 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph E. Wilson, a Simi Valley assistant superintendent responsible for 
preparing the district's budget and handling school earthquake repairs, will 
become top administrator for the Gustine Unified School District in Merced 
County this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The 63-year-old head of administrative services had been in Simi Valley only 
one year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The opportunity arose and I thought it was a good time," Wilson said Monday, 
his last day in the Simi Valley job. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Supt. Mary Beth Wolford said Wilson's duties will be shared by 
various district officials until a replacement is found, it is hoped, by the 
start of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tremendous job," she said of Wilson's position. "I anticipate that I 
will be kind of alone for the rest of the summer until we can find a 
replacement for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Before joining Simi Valley Unified last year, Wilson served as an assistant 
superintendent for the Barstow Unified School District for three years and had 
worked previously as an administrator in several other school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said his year in Simi Valley has been memorable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had some major budget deficits and we've dealt with them reasonably well," 
he said. "And then, of course, the earthquake has been a major (issue)." 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, he said, "most of the heavy duty work is done." TRACY WILSON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; VOLUNTEERS SOUGHT FOR POLICE STOREFRONT 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura County Sheriff's Department is looking for a few good volunteers 
to work in a police storefront scheduled to open in Moorpark at the end of the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Martin Rouse, who heads the Moorpark Enforcement Division for the 
sheriff's department, said the volunteers will be asked to staff the desk in 
the new High Street facility four hours each week. 
</P>
<P>
 A department cadet, working 20 hours a week, will serve alongside the 
volunteers, Rouse said. The department hopes eventually to use only volunteers, 
which would free the cadet to return to a parking enforcement patrol in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's our goal, but we need the right kind of volunteers to make it work," 
he said. "People with public relations skills, for instance, who are ready to 
answer questions and help out." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies assigned to Moorpark will drop by the facility on patrol, possibly 
using the site to write up reports, Rouse said. City officials are hoping that 
the increased law-enforcement presence downtown will make people more 
comfortable and improve business on High Street. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information about volunteering call Deputy Jody Keller at 494-8258.

POSITIVE STORY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Your article about our Catholic "surfing priest" on July 10 was wonderfully 
refreshing to read. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a fine article was tainted by the four paragraphs devoted to the past 
incident of Father David Piroli. 
</P>
<P>
 So often the media assumes the public desires to hear about the scandalous and 
criminal actions of the clergy. I assure you that is false. It was very 
pleasing to read a positive and well-written article on a healthy, happy 
priest, Father Dennis Mongrain, who is dedicated to building up the body of 
Christ as well as his own biceps.

PLAN FOR QUALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have been a resident of Ventura for the last year and a half, moving from 
Moorpark where I resided for seven years and witnessed a once sleepy community 
quadruple in size. What the residents of Ventura are currently experiencing is 
a "con job" by contractors, developers, special interest groups and 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura Unified School District has dozens of fields which have been sadly 
neglected due to budgetary constraints. If we were smart, we would enhance our 
existing resources by placing all school fields (after a certain hour and 
months of the year) under the direction of the city Parks and Recreation 
Department. They would manage the various sports programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of my four children participate in organized girls softball in Ventura. I 
can appreciate the frustrations of not having a "sports complex" like other 
cities half our size. However, we need to set priorities and take a stand, due 
to the fact that houses will be constructed, and Ventura will change and grow. 
What we need is a plan to assign costs and increase the quality of life for all 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The current "con job" is using smoke and mirrors for the hidden agendas of 
special interest groups to rob our children of the opportunity for a good 
education. In any event, this is a pay-now or pay-later scenario. Someone is 
going to negotiate a contract. Should the park be the only issue on the table?

Simpson's defense team has injected new controversy into the case, suggesting 
that the officer may have planted a key piece of evidence against Simpson -- 
the bloody glove. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Simpson's defense team are using a 1983 disability pension case 
filed by Detective Mark Fuhrman along with other research into his work history 
in an effort to show that his credibility has previously been challenged, that 
he has made derogatory racial statements and that he may have lied about his 
conduct in the Simpson probe. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuhrman, who found a bloody glove outside Simpson's Brentwood mansion, 
testified during this month's preliminary hearing, after which the football 
Hall of Famer was ordered to stand trial for the double murders of Nicole Brown 
Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Simpson's defense camp say they do not expect to challenge the 
42-year-old detective by suggesting that he is racist, but rather hope to use 
questions about his work history -- including the 1983 disability case and a 
more recent investigation of his treatment of female colleagues -- to raise 
doubts about his credibility or even to suggest that he might have planted the 
glove in order to be hailed as a hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuhrman's 1983 case came to light on a national scale Sunday with news that 
Newsweek and the New Yorker magazine were publishing stories analyzing the 
defense strategy and its efforts to discredit the officer. As with other 
developments in the ever-evolving Simpson case, it spawned a rash of other 
requests for interviews, and LAPD officials were deluged by reporters again 
Monday. They declined to comment, saying the work history of Fuhrman, who 
joined the LAPD in 1975, was a personnel matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack on Fuhrman's credibility is a risky one, in part because it would 
focus a jury's attention on the significance of a bloody glove turning up at 
the home of the defendant. No witnesses have come forward to say that they saw 
Fuhrman plant the glove, but experts say the defense attack on his credibility 
is probably motivated by a desire to make jurors suspicious of the glove when 
they weigh Simpson's guilt or innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 The likely intent of the defense maneuver "is to undercut the credibility of 
the police investigation and the prosecution case -- just raise doubts," said 
Laurie Levenson, a Loyola law school professor and former federal prosecutor. 
"Even if this theory doesn't work, it would be kind of an instructive lesson to 
the jurors about how they can go about looking for problems with the 
prosecution case -- to start them thinking of all the ways the prosecution 
could have unfairly pinned this on O.J. Simpson." 
</P>
<P>
 During the contentious preliminary hearing, Simpson's attorneys, led by Robert 
L. Shapiro, repeatedly suggested that their client is being railroaded by 
overzealous or careless investigators. Among other things, Shapiro accused 
police of lying to obtain a search warrant, of failing to protect the scene of 
the crime and of mishandling important pieces of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers did not have Fuhrman's work history on hand for that hearing, 
but have since uncovered several pieces of information that they will probably 
use as the case proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fuhrman's 1983 lawsuit, he told therapists that he was suffering from 
intense stress, that he left the Marine Corps after developing antagonistic 
feelings toward Mexican and African Americans, that he had beaten suspects and 
that he was preoccupied with violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "During his last six months (in the Marine Corps), he 'got tired of having a 
bunch of Mexicans and niggers that should be in prison telling (him) they 
weren't going to do something,' " Fuhrman was quoted as saying in one 
psychiatric evaluation performed in connection with the 1983 case. 
</P>
<P>
 Those and other racially charged comments may come back to haunt Fuhrman, 
lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are his own words and he may live to regret them," said Los Angeles 
defense lawyer Marcia A. Morrisey. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Fuhrman's credibility was challenged in 1983 by the very people 
who now employ him, the city of Los Angeles. In arguing that Fuhrman should not 
receive the stress pension he was seeking, lawyers and doctors for the city 
accused him of exaggerating his psychological problems for financial gain. 
</P>
<P>
 "This man has become tired of police work just as he became bored with life as 
a Marine," said Dr. Ronald R. Koegler, a doctor who examined Fuhrman on behalf 
of the city in that case. "He does not want to quit and lose his benefits, so 
he is attempting to get pension and compensation rewards." 
</P>
<P>
 Police pension cases such as this one often produce wildly divergent accounts 
of an officer's health. Police officers claiming stress frequently try to find 
psychiatrists who will say they are suffering, while city-hired doctors 
typically counter that the officers are in fine health and are lying to get a 
pension. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuhrman lost the pension lawsuit, and his troubles with the LAPD did not end 
there. He has been sued unsuccessfully several times by people claiming he used 
excessive force. And according to department sources, he is currently a target 
of an LAPD probe into alleged sexual harassment at the West Los Angeles 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuhrman, those sources said, belongs to an informal club known as MAW -- short 
for Men Against Women. The group has attracted officers who deride the ability 
of female colleagues and who believe that women are unfit for police work. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD is conducting a sweeping audit of the West Los Angeles station, where 
Fuhrman works. The department has transferred a number of officers to other 
divisions in order to improve the working environment in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the same police sources who said Fuhrman is being investigated 
in the sexual harassment probe also consider him an outstanding investigator. 
His recent cases have included a number of widely praised performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuhrman's performance on the witness stand during Simpson's preliminary 
hearing also impressed lawyers, police and lay people. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts agreed that no challenge to Fuhrman's character or integrity 
would be enough to exclude the bloody glove from evidence unless some witness 
says Fuhrman planted it at the house. No such witness has come forward, and 
sources suggest several potential problems with that theory. 
</P>
<P>
 First, they say, Fuhrman was not the first police officer to arrive at the 
scene of the murders. By the time he got there, a number of patrol officers 
were on hand, and none of them have reported seeing a second bloody glove near 
the bodies. To plant one of the gloves at Simpson's house, Fuhrman would have 
had to find it at the scene of the crime after other officers had overlooked 
it, then he would have had to surreptitiously pocket it and carry it to 
Simpson's home unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, police sources point out, Simpson friend Brian (Kato) Kaelin testified 
during the preliminary hearing that he heard three loud thumps outside his wall 
on the night of the murders. It was when Kaelin told Fuhrman about that 
thumping that the detective went to investigate and returned with news that he 
had discovered the glove. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, by raising questions about Fuhrman's past, defense attorneys may be 
able to conduct a more searching analysis of department personnel records to 
determine whether the detective has been the subject of other complaints. That, 
in turn, may give them additional grist to challenge the detective's 
credibility if and when he takes the stand in the Simpson trial. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the latest disclosures have injected race into the already 
volatile case, a development that defense attorneys say may be inevitable even 
though few welcome it in a city famous for its recent racial tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., a prominent Los Angeles attorney whose name has been 
floated as a possible addition to the Simpson legal team, said questions about 
Fuhrman's racial attitudes are relevant and should be pursued by the 
ex-athlete's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "As much as I don't want to see race brought into this case, if this person 
has a feeling against minorities, his credibility becomes very much at issue," 
Cochran said. "It could be a very powerful issue. . . . I think you'll see the 
defense really seek to exploit it." 
</P>
<P>
 That, too, is a risky proposition, however. Some analysts, such as UCLA law 
professor Peter Arenella, warned that calling attention to the issue of race 
could antagonize some jurors even as it meets with the approval of others. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the allegations about Fuhrman surfaced, some polls were suggesting that 
whites and blacks perceive the handling of the Simpson case differently. Dist. 
Atty. Gil Garcetti is scheduled to meet this morning with John Mack, president 
of the Los Angeles Urban League, and with other prominent African Americans to 
discuss the Simpson case, according to an invitation to the meeting obtained by 
The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Mack would not comment on the meeting. But a source close to the league said 
Garcetti asked for the meeting after some blacks expressed concerns over what 
they saw as potentially prejudicial public statements he and others in his 
office made early in the case. Others worried that the prosecution, intent upon 
winning the case above all else, would not deal Simpson a fair hand, the source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The racially charged comments attributed to Fuhrman in his disability case are 
11 years old, a fact that might weigh against a judge allowing them to be 
admitted in the Simpson trial or in hearings leading up to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though racial bias would be admitted in some cases to impeach, his 
racial views are old to begin with," said E. Thomas Dunn, an Orange County 
deputy district attorney and evidence specialist. "They don't necessarily 
reflect his current beliefs. They seem to me of marginal relevance. Whether a 
person is racially biased . . . does not necessarily impact upon his 
observations at the scene of a crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, other legal experts agreed that much of the material, as well as 
any comments connected to the sexual harassment probe, might work their way 
into the Simpson case if they cast any doubt on Fuhrman's history of telling 
the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Keane, chief deputy public defender of San Francisco, said he thought 
Fuhrman's prior statements would be admissible during cross-examination because 
they suggested that the detective might have a hidden bias in the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 "It goes to bias," Keane said. "Bias is one of the principal ways of attacking 
and impeaching a witness on cross-examination." 
</P>
<P>
 Courts have allowed lawyers broad discretion in challenging the credibility of 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the right of prosecutors to introduce 
evidence that a defendant and a key alibi witness in a Bellflower bank robbery 
case both had been members of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang, described by 
the court as "a secret prison sect sworn to perjury and self-protection." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense contended that the gang information was highly inflammatory and 
increased the chance that the jury would convict the defendant merely because 
of his gang association. But the high court ruled that it was permissible for 
prosecutors to cross-examine the witness about the prison gang to show possible 
bias in favor of the defendant and to show past conduct that would bear on his 
truthfulness as a witness.

BLAST LEVELS ARGENTINE JEWISH CENTER, KILLS 26; SOUTH AMERICA: PRESIDENT MENEM 
SAYS ATTACK WAS PLANNED 'FROM ABROAD.' AREA IN BUENOS AIRES DEVASTATED.

<P>
 A huge explosion, probably a terrorist bomb, destroyed a seven-story downtown 
building housing two Jewish groups here Monday. At least 26 people were killed 
and 127 were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescue workers feared they would find more bodies in the rubble of the 
building, where about 100 people worked. 
</P>
<P>
 The blast, which occurred shortly before 10 a.m., flattened cars and hurled 
deadly shards of glass and concrete along busy Pasteur Street. Parts of 
adjacent buildings also were destroyed, and others nearby were severely 
damaged. Many of the injured were passersby. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem, who said the attack was planned "from 
abroad and helped by people here," called the perpetrators "beasts, savages." 
</P>
<P>
 The explosion coincided with the start of peace talks between Israel and 
Jordan. Jewish community sources said the government has told them that they 
believe the explosion was the work of a Muslim fundamentalist group that came 
into the country from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher, visiting Israel, said the attack was "a 
reminder that despite the glowing prospects there are still the enemies of 
peace around the world, not only here in the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, at least 29 people were killed, and more than 200 injured, in a 
bomb attack on the Israeli Embassy here. Police have not established 
responsibility for that explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 The building that was reduced to rubble Monday housed the Argentine Israelite 
Mutual Assn. and the Delegation of Argentine Israelite Assns., two of the most 
important Jewish organizations. About 250,000 Jews live in Argentina, most in 
Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin called the attack "a cowardly, criminal 
and evil act," vowing that "Israel will continue to chase the perpetrators of 
terrorism to the end." 
</P>
<P>
 A Palestine Liberation Organization official in Argentina denounced the blast. 
</P>
<P>
 "We deeply lament this attack against peace," said Sujail Aquel, who 
represents the PLO in Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
 A group calling itself Islamic Command telephoned a local radio station to 
take responsibility for the attack, but officials said nothing was known about 
such a group and that the call could have been a hoax. 
</P>
<P>
 Menem ordered the borders closed, and said two people were detained -- an 
Iraqi carrying an expired Brazilian passport at the border with Brazil and an 
Iranian detained elsewhere. The president gave no details. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, a German woman and Iranian man were detained for questioning at 
Ezeiza International Airport outside Buenos Aires but were later released. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first hours after the explosion, Pasteur Street was crowded with rescue 
workers, volunteers, onlookers and people seeking news about relatives and 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 A child and a young man were brought out of the ruins alive more than eight 
hours after the blast. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd also gathered outside the nearby Clinicas Hospital, where most of the 
victims were taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior Secretary Alberto Iribarne said late Monday that 26 people were 
killed and 127 injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruben Beraja, president of the Delegation of Argentine Israelite Assns., said 
in a telephone interview that the scope of damage was so great it looked as if 
the explosives had been placed by demolition experts. Because Argentine 
extremists are not known to have such expertise, he said, the attack appeared 
to be the work of international terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has the characteristics of being a repeat of actions by Islamic 
fundamentalists," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fundamentalist group Hezbollah is suspected in the March 17, 1992, attack 
on the Israeli Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
 One project housed in the building destroyed Monday seemed to raise the 
possibility of a motive for the bombing unrelated to the Middle East: It was 
the headquarters for research into previously secret government files to trace 
the steps of World War II Nazis who immigrated to Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2-year-old project, far from complete, has turned up documents that detail 
a historical pattern of tolerance and complicity benefiting the fugitive Nazis. 
Beraja said much of the documentation compiled in the project may have been 
destroyed in the explosion. But he said the possibility that pro-Nazi groups 
could have set off the explosion was remote because they are not believed to 
have the "operational capacity" for such an attack.

ISRAEL, JORDAN MOVE TALKS TO FAMILIAR TURF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY CURTIUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Against the stark backdrop of the barren Edomite Mountains, sheltered from the 
scorching sun by a gaily striped tent, Israelis fulfilled a dream Monday by 
sitting down on their land to talk peace with Jordanians. 
</P>
<P>
 The yellow-and-white air-conditioned tent in which they met symbolically 
straddled the cease-fire line in the Arava Valley. It is one of the hottest 
places on Earth and divides the southern regions of the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by barbed wire and minefields eight miles north of the twin ports 
of Aqaba and Eilat, negotiators opened two days of talks on marking their 
disputed border, sharing scarce water resources and ensuring border security. 
</P>
<P>
 They paused only long enough for reporters to take pictures and to give 
opening speeches before shedding their jackets, rolling up their sleeves and 
beginning to haggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see, Eli, you are already making me sweat," a Jordanian diplomat said 
jokingly to Elyakim Rubinstein, head of Israel's negotiating team, as the 
Jordanian pointed to his perspiration-soaked shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 104 degrees in the valley as the talks began. Both Israeli and 
Jordanian television broadcast live the opening speeches and a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 By day's end, both sides were describing the talks as "very positive" and the 
site -- a nature reserve -- as inspirational. But they offered no details of 
their eight-hour session. 
</P>
<P>
 The two negotiating teams have met periodically in Washington for more than 
two years. But the Israelis have repeatedly called on the Jordanians and other 
Arab states to move the talks to the region, arguing that only then would the 
notion of a comprehensive settlement between Israel and its neighbors seem real 
to Arabs and Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jordanians sat on their side of the cease-fire line, on the east side of a 
rectangular table straddling the line, and the Israelis sat on theirs. But Faiz 
Tarawneh, head of the Jordanian team, seemed relaxed as he gave the first 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is our expectation that the satisfactory results of the negotiations and 
accepted agreements will culminate in a treaty of peace that delineates 
carefully our rights and duties under conditions of peace," said Tarawneh, who 
also is Jordan's ambassador to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "As our meeting begins, we should be motivated to live up to the forthcoming 
historical responsibilities," he said, noting that King Hussein will hold his 
first public meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin next Monday in 
Washington, hosted by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubinstein said in his opening remarks: "We are at a very warm spot of our two 
countries. The temperature is high. It is only natural to express the hope that 
the Israeli-Jordanian peaceful relations will be warm forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides acknowledged the quickening pace of Israeli-Jordanian negotiations 
but cautioned that much work remains to be done before a peace treaty can be 
made final. The 30-member teams quickly broke up into three specialized 
committees to deal separately with the question of the border, with security 
and with water, energy and environment. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres will travel to the 
Jordanian side of the Dead Sea to meet with Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul 
Salam Majali. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who arrived in Israel on Sunday hoping 
to push forward deadlocked Israeli-Syrian talks, will join the two foreign 
ministers at a Dead Sea hotel for talks on three-way economic projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "The overwhelming majority of the Israeli public supports peace with Jordan," 
Rubinstein told his Jordanian counterparts Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, leaders of the opposition Likud Party -- who vehemently condemned 
Israel's agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organization granting limited 
self-government to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip -- have 
supported the talks with Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace with Jordan is a popular notion in Israel because Israelis expect they 
will pay little and benefit greatly from signing a formal peace treaty with the 
Hashemite Kingdom. Although the two countries have technically been in a state 
of war for 46 years, the border between them has been quiet since the 1967 
Arab-Israeli War; they have secretly cooperated on security issues and some 
water-sharing projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people here pretty much support the peace process and are very excited 
about the potential for peace," said David Lehrer, secretary general of kibbutz 
Getura, a collective farm just five miles north of the negotiating tent that 
may lose some of its fields if the Jordanians succeed in pressing their claims 
for land. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Getura should lose some of its lands, Lehrer said, "I could not be 
opposed to a peace agreement between Jordan and Israel on the basis of a loss 
of a number of (acres) in the Arava. If a sacrifice has to be made, it has to 
be made." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan is laying claim to 147 square miles of the Arava desert, much of which 
now is being cultivated by collective Israeli farms. At least two Israeli 
collectives stand to lose virtually all their arable land. But kibbutzniks hope 
that economic cooperation between the two countries will boost regional tourism 
and trade and compensate them for any losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Such an optimistic outlook is not shared by all Jordanians. Hussein faces 
opposition from Islamic fundamentalists and from some leftist groups that have 
condemned Jordan's negotiations with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is taking place today and what will follow is a source of great sorrow 
and sadness," Hamzah Mansour, spokesman for the Islamic Action Front, told 
Reuters news service in Amman on Monday. The front is the second-largest bloc 
in the Jordanian Parliament.

HUFFINGTON DISRUPTS DEMOCRATIC EVENT; POLITICS: OUTSIDE A PRIVATE HOME, 
CANDIDATE CONFRONTS FEINSTEIN ON CHARGE HE IS ANTI-JEWISH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING and DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican U.S. Senate candidate Michael Huffington disrupted a Democratic 
women's fund-raiser featuring Sen. Dianne Feinstein by showing up outside a 
private home Monday night and complaining to the incumbent and a dozen arriving 
guests about allegations that he is anti-Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a drizzly evening sky, punctuated by claps of thunder and lightning, 
Huffington stood alone on the sidewalk in shirt sleeves and presented a copy of 
the event's invitation letter to each of the women guests as they arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Caught by surprise, most listened quietly as the Santa Barbara congressman 
pointed to a sentence that said Huffington "represents everything that is 
antithetical to us as women and as Jews." Some of the guests tried to elude the 
candidate and he followed one as she crossed the lawn to escape his lecture. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a three-ring circus, I can't believe it," said Lynn Cutler, a former 
Democratic National Committee officer who wrote the letter and was host of the 
small event at her two-story Colonial home. "For a man to show such irrational, 
rude, crazy behavior. This is crazy. What's the matter with him? This is not 
rational behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein arrived about 7:45 p.m., apparently forewarned of her opponent's 
plan. As she stepped out of a Buick Park Avenue car, she heard a loud clap of 
thunder and quipped: "See, I've got God on my side." 
</P>
<P>
 Watched by a camera crew and two reporters who had been alerted by Huffington, 
the candidates met on the sidewalk and cordially said hello. But soon, voices 
were raised. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington insisted that Feinstein denounce the event because he said it 
violated campaign finance laws and because the reference that he is anti-Jewish 
was an "outrageous" attempt to "play the religion card." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein said that she had not even read the invitation letter and that she 
was merely a guest at the event sponsored by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign 
Committee. "I thought a congressman would have something better to do at this 
time, huh, Michael?" she said to Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a few minutes, she turned the exchange into an opportunity to renew her 
demand that Huffington release his income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 After Feinstein walked away and spoke with reporters near the front door, 
Huffington yelled from the sidewalk about 30 feet away that he had faxed the 
invitation letter to her house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think maybe it is a little desperation time," Feinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's confrontation added a theatrical episode to a campaign that has 
been dominated by back-and-forth accusations and name-calling. With huge stakes 
for both candidates and national political parties, both campaigns continued a 
nonstop television barrage Monday by releasing new commercials that responded 
to attacks each broadcast last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the Democratic fund-raiser Monday, Huffington contended that the event 
at Cutler's home violated campaign finance laws because the invitation letter 
asked each guest to pay $1,500 and suggested that it could be designated for 
the Feinstein campaign. Huffington said the $1,500 exceeds the federal limit of 
$1,000 contributions for individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican National Committee filed a complaint Monday with the Federal 
Election Commission, asking that Feinstein be penalized for the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein campaign officials said the money would go to the Democratic Party 
and that none of the money would go directly to her reelection committee. But 
the national and state political parties can spend more than $2.5 million to 
help the California nominees for U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Federal Election Commission could not comment on the event 
or the complaint, but he confirmed that the $1,000 limit would apply to a 
Democratic Party fund-raiser if the funds were designated for a specific 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutler scoffed at the charge, saying she has raised millions of dollars for 
the party over many years and there was nothing unique about the gathering of 
about a dozen invited guests at her home. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is slanderous," she charged. "I don't raise illegal money. Now why don't 
they just get a life and try to run a campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 What most irritated Huffington, however, was the contention that he is 
anti-Jewish. Cutler wrote in her letter: "Huffington is a radical right 
candidate. He is adamantly opposed to a woman's right to choose. He represents 
everything that is antithetical to us as women and as Jews."

 Huffington favors abortion rights and three Jewish lobby organizations in 
Washington Monday said they were unaware of any anti-Jewish posture. They also 
noted that he has voted in favor of aid to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutler explained that "these are my opinions, after doing a fair amount of 
reading up on Mr. Huffington." She insisted that Huffington is opposed to 
abortion rights and said that can also be an anti-Jewish position because "90% 
of the American Jewish public is pro-choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside Cutler's home, Huffington explained his disruption to guests as they 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to emphasize . . . that I am not who this lady says I am," he told 
reporters. "I think it is outrageous that people will try to raise money on 
fear. I'll debate Mrs. Feinstein on any issue she wants at any time. But this 
kind of thing is not debatable. It is improper and frankly, it is disgusting. 
And that's why I'm here in person." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington arrived by himself about 10 minutes before the event in a gray 
Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, as he waited, Huffington suggested to a reporter that Feinstein 
might try to sneak into the home through a side entrance, so he walked to a 
corner of the building to get a better view. When a member of Feinstein's staff 
appeared outside, he also inquired: "Is she due imminently?" indicating that he 
could not stay long. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington stayed for about 30 minutes before he left and all of the guests 
were inside. At one point, Cutler came out to chastise him. When Huffington 
approached one older woman, Cutler said: "Leona, come on in. You don't have to 
be subjected to this. You are a guest in my home. He is acting like a child."

THE WHOLE ENCHILADA: IT'S TOO FAT FOR YOU, STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 A typical serving of beef chimichangas, chile rellenos or other popular menu 
items at Mexican restaurants exceeds the federal government's recommended daily 
limit of fat, saturated fat and sodium, according to a study released Monday by 
a Washington-based nutritional advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey of restaurant chains and independent diners by the Center for 
Science in the Public Interest contends that Mexican restaurants have been lax 
in offering healthier alternatives to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, the group has issued similar killjoy reports detailing the 
dangers of food in Chinese and Italian restaurants as well as movie theater 
popcorn. But results from the Mexican food survey make kung pao chicken and 
lasagna "look good," the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 The study drew immediate fire from the restaurant industry, which charged that 
the sampling technique was flawed. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 12 commonly ordered dishes, only one -- chicken fajitas -- derives less 
than 30% of its total calories from fat, the group said. In comparison, a 
Szechwan shrimp dish derives about 18%, while a plate of spaghetti with clam 
sauce derives 23%. 
</P>
<P>
 The study found many Mexican offerings are filled with artery-clogging fat. 
Eating two chile rellenos with beans and rice, the study said, is equivalent to 
eating a quarter-pound stick of butter, which contains 92 grams of fat. An 
average restaurant beef chimichanga with beans, rice, sour cream and guacamole 
contains 86 grams of fat, while a Big Mac-and-fries lunch contains 48 grams, 
according to the group's data. 
</P>
<P>
 Even such side dishes as guacamole or rice and beans can deliver two-thirds of 
the recommended daily fat allowance, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To those of us who've enjoyed Mexican foods, these results are pretty 
depressing," said Michael Jacobson, the group's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 And unlike Chinese or Italian restaurants, most Mexican eateries offer almost 
nada for health-conscious consumers, Jacobson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Epidemiologically, Hispanics have a higher incidence of heart disease than 
Chinese and Italians," said Dr. Howard Hodis of USC. "But it's a big leap 
forward" from restaurant food to heart disease, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it ain't broke, don't fix it," Olympic boxing champion Paul Gonzalez said 
in Los Angeles Monday, breaking into a broad grin as he pulled a nacho -- 
dripping with cheese -- from a large platter at La Parrilla restaurant on Cesar 
Chavez Blvd. on the city's eastside. 
</P>
<P>
 And for Gonzalez, who won a Gold Medal in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, 
Mexican food definitely "ain't broke." 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up on Mexican food," Gonzalez said. "A lot of people who eat the same 
food live to be 100 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez said that his girlfriend, Diana Magana, owns a Mexican restaurant, 
but she won't let him eat popcorn. "I reminded her that when I was in training, 
I would eat a box of popcorn and that would be my dinner," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Center for Science in the Public Interest study, which was designed with 
help from the Agriculture Department, sampled 135 dishes from mid-priced 
Mexican-food chains, including Chi-Chi's and El Torito, and independent 
restaurants in San Francisco, Chicago, Dallas and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 To determine the fat and sodium content of each dish, researchers combined 
samples of a single dish from different restaurants to make one composite and 
then sent that to a laboratory in Pennsylvania for nutritional testing. The 
group used the same methodology in its earlier surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 Herman Cain, president of the National Restaurant Assn., said that using 
composites rather than testing each individual sample masks "the fact that the 
Mexican restaurant sector as a whole is doing an excellent job of providing 
alternative choices for the nutrition-conscious," even though such customers 
make up only 30% of their clientele, according to industry polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry leaders called the study "misleading," but the group said that 
testing individual samples of each dish would have been too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Paul, president of Technomic Inc., a Chicago-based consulting firm 
specializing in the food-services industry, said that composite sampling makes 
the research "incomplete," because no restaurant actually serves the mixed dish 
developed by the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobson urged restaurateurs to switch to less-fatty cheeses and sour cream, 
use leaner ground beef and cut the amount of fat added to beans and rice. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurant executives said that their menus already offer plenty of healthy 
fare but customers in many cases choose the tastier, but more fatty, 
selections. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given a choice, they often pick the high-fat items anyway and go into it with 
their eyes open," said Bruce MacDiarmid, vice president for marketing for San 
Francisco-based Chevy's Mexican Restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel an obligation to offer enough of a variety so people can make their 
own decision," said Lynn Miller, a spokeswoman for Chi Chi's Mexican 
Restaurants based in Louisville, Ky. The company has tested low-fat guacamole 
and other light fare in the past but met with only lukewarm customer response, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because many Mexican food fans are already aware of the content of their food, 
demand for overhauling the menus is unlikely, Paul said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, La Parrilla owner Maria del Carmen Salas has yielded to 
customer concerns about health, switching to vegetable oil rather than lard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's afraid of high cholesterol, so we changed for health reasons," 
she said. But she is not about to tamper with her chile rellenos. 
</P>
<P>
 As for suggestions that Mexican restaurants consider switching to brown rice, 
and that they bake rather than fry tortilla chips, Del Carmen Salas simply 
rolls her eyes incredulously. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though she has switched to vegetable oil in her restaurant, she misses 
the taste of refried beans cooked the old way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in Mexico three weeks ago and ate some beans cooked with lard," she 
said. "They were so good!" 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican food has been stereotyped as tortillas, tacos, burritos -- some of the 
most fattening menu items, she said. But traditional Mexican cuisine is laden 
with a variety of seafood and grilled meats that are low in fat, she said. 
</P>

story from Los Angeles.

 The list of food that's less-than-healthy continues to grow. The Center for 
Science in the Public Interest recently surveyed a selection of the most 
popular dishes served at mid-priced fast-food Mexican chains. Their findings: 
much of the food is very high in fat and sodium. Here is a sampling of

JUPITER TAKES HUGE BLOW FROM COMET; SPACE: EXPLOSION IS DESCRIBED AS HAVING 
HUNDREDS OF TIMES THE COMBINED ENERGY OF ALL NUCLEAR WEAPONS ON EARTH. FIREBALL 
BRIEFLY OUTSHINES THE PLANET ITSELF. 
</P>

<P>
 An immense fragment of a dying comet hit Jupiter so hard early Monday that the 
blast momentarily blinded the world's largest optical telescope and sent awed 
astronomers around the world scrambling for superlatives to describe the 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
 At NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, which is coordinating 
reports on the ongoing collision of Jupiter with the pieces of a shattered 
comet, astronomers estimated the force of the impact at 6 million megatons of 
TNT -- hundreds of times the combined energy in all the world's nuclear 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of Fragment G, as the two-mile-wide piece of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 
is designated, created a fireball that briefly outshone Jupiter itself, 
scientists said. An equally large fragment hit late Monday and another of 
similar size was expected to hit Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact, the most powerful planetary explosion ever observed, sent 
superheated gases spewing thousands of miles into space from a planet already 
marred by black scars left by nine chunks of comet debris that have fallen 
since Saturday. The fragment plunged about 60 miles into Jupiter's atmosphere 
before exploding, scientists estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The energy released is beyond any of our experiences on Earth," said Lucy 
McFadden, a University of Maryland astronomer. "Ten thousand megatons is the 
total energy that we can create on Earth with bombs." 
</P>
<P>
 Jupiter's black eye, as planetary scientist Heidi B. Hammel dubbed the 
enormous, circular plume erupting from the giant planet Monday, is 
approximately 9,600 miles across and, during its peak at 12:51 a.m. PDT, rose 
more than 1,300 miles into space, scientists said. Hammel is leading the team 
of scientists gathered in Maryland to analyze the images produced by NASA's 
Hubble Space Telescope. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that G got as bright as Jupiter itself in the infrared (a heat 
measurement) means that we're dealing with a very big object," said Eugene 
Shoemaker, an astronomer at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Ariz., and one 
of the discoverers of the comet. "It's a big wallop." 
</P>
<P>
 Astronomers watching the fireworks through the largest optical telescope in 
the world -- the W.M. Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea in Hawaii -- said the 
unusual flare was so bright that it overwhelmed the instrument's infrared 
sensors, briefly preventing them from recording the impact. "We saw a truly 
remarkable large plume," said astronomer Imke de Pater, a principal 
investigator on the Keck Telescope from UC Berkeley. "It completely saturated 
the telescope." 
</P>
<P>
 Viewed by the space telescope through an ultraviolet filter, which can reveal 
detail not normally visible, the impact site is as large as Jupiter's giant Red 
Spot -- twice as large as Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the boil of debris and gases rising from the impacts, unusual chemicals 
never before observed on Jupiter are being detected by Earth-based astronomers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are seeing emissions they have never seen before because they are seeing 
conditions we have never seen before," said University of Michigan scientist 
John Clarke, who is monitoring Jupiter's aurora for blast effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Jupiter, which has more than 300 times the mass of Earth, is not expected to 
suffer any long-term damage from the comet. Jupiter is 480 million miles from 
Earth, too far for the comet to have any influence here, scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the comet fragments are landing on Jupiter's night side, which faces 
away from Earth. But the planet rotates so quickly, and the fireballs are 
rising so high above Jupiter's clouds, that the impact sites quickly swing into 
view of observers on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 The bombardment, which is expected to continue through early Friday, has 
created enormous public interest, stirring superstitious dread and scientific 
curiosity in equal measure. It is the first time anyone has been able to watch 
-- even indirectly -- as a comet hits a planet. 
</P>
<P>
 So much electronic mail concerning observations of Jupiter has been generated 
by amateur and professional astronomers this week that computer traffic has 
achieved gridlock at key astronomy interchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is maintaining an on-line archive of 
the comet images and related astronomical data, 45,000 computer users had 
signed on to the system by lunchtime Monday. Even senior astronomers at the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard center were having 
trouble getting access to the latest electronic bulletins from around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 The spectacle on Jupiter is stirring new misgivings about Earth's 
vulnerability to celestial impacts. An object the size of Fragment G can be 
expected to hit Earth every few hundred thousand years, scientists say, and 
there are 150 known impact craters on the planet. About 1,000 known objects of 
this size or larger are in orbits that periodically cross Earth's path; none is 
on a collision course with Earth, scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
 As powerful as Monday's impact appeared to observers here, its force was only 
a fraction of that generated by celestial objects believed to have struck Earth 
millions of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-mile-wide Chicxulub crater, recently discovered in Mexico's Yucatan, is 
believed by some scientists to be the imprint of a comet or asteroid 
responsible for the demise of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The object that caused the crater, Shoemaker said Monday, probably was three 
times larger and 27 times as powerful as the piece of comet debris that kicked 
up so much fire Monday on Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not a dinosaur killer," Shoemaker said of the impact.

 A two-mile-wide comet fragment hit Jupiter on Monday in the largest planetary 
blast ever observed. But the bombardment, occurring 480 million miles from 
Earth, will not affect conditions here. Here's a look at the impact of Fragment 
G. 
</P>
<P>
 Facts and Figures: 
</P>
<P>
 * Fragment G: One of 21 fragments of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 hitting Jupiter 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 * Impact: If it fell here, the crater would cover much of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 * Area: Its impact zone is 9,600 miles wide 
</P>
<P>
 * Height: The plume is 1,300 miles high 
</P>
<P>
 * Heat: 53,000 degrees Fahrenheit 
</P>
<P>
 * Force: An estimated 6 million megatons of TNT.

MILLIONS FLEE RWANDA; REBELS SAY WAR IS OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Millions of Rwandans fled toward uncertain safety in neighboring nations 
Monday as Tutsi rebels declared an immediate cease-fire, an end to Rwanda's 
civil war and the installation of a new government. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rebels' promise of a unilateral cease-fire did little to reassure 
millions of Hutu refugees -- by one estimate nearly half the prewar population. 
They are seeking shelter in neighboring countries for fear the victorious 
rebels will retaliate for the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people -- 
most of them Tutsis -- by Hutu militias. 
</P>
<P>
 Between Wednesday and Sunday, up to 1 million Hutu civilians and soldiers 
pushed into Goma, Zaire, from the northwestern Rwandan town of Gisenyi. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Monday, refugee officials reported that an estimated 1.9 million more 
Hutus were streaming toward the southwestern Rwandan border town of Cyangugu, 
heading for Bukavu, Zaire, 60 miles south of Goma. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happened so suddenly and nobody is ready. The barriers are open and nobody 
can stop them," Marianne Coradazzi of the International Committee of the Red 
Cross said from Bukavu. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100,000 people crossed Sunday and Monday. If the rest of the 1.9 million 
on the move cross into Zaire, almost 3.5 million Rwandans -- almost half of the 
estimated prewar population of 8 million -- would be living in refugee camps in 
neighboring countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Before last week's mass flight, more than half a million made their way into 
Tanzania, Burundi and Uganda. Hundreds of thousands more are displaced within 
Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, transport planes flew more aid into Zaire on Monday for the 
refugees there. But relief agencies said they were overwhelmed and expressed 
fears about the eventual death toll. 
</P>
<P>
 Water was in critically short supply in this area of volcanic rock where 
rainfall just disappears, said Samantha Bolton of the relief agency Doctors 
Without Borders, adding: "It's impossible to know how many are dying -- 
dysentery, malaria and dehydration. People are collapsing in the camps." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States on Monday pledged more to the relief effort, for a total of 
$118 million in humanitarian assistance to Rwanda and Burundi since April. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Atwood, the Clinton Administration's special envoy for disaster 
assistance, had said earlier Monday that the United States would work with the 
Rwandan Patriotic Front to rebuild the country if the rebels halted their 
offensive and formed an acceptable government that included moderate Hutus. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutus make up about 90% of the population in Rwanda, a mountainous, mostly 
agricultural nation the size of Maryland. Although Tutsis are less than 10% of 
the population, they ruled the area for centuries; the country has a history of 
ethnic massacres. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence flared in Rwanda on April 6 when President Juvenal Habyarimana, a 
Hutu, died in a suspicious plane crash. Within hours, Hutu militias began 
systematically killing anyone perceived to oppose the government. 
</P>
<P>
 The predominantly Tutsi rebels then relaunched a war against the Hutu 
government that had been halted by a peace accord in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the rump Hutu government had apparently encouraged the latest human 
flood through Rwanda's southwestern corner, where French forces have declared a 
humanitarian protection zone, said Fernando del Mundo, spokesman for the U.N. 
High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
 "The refugees are saying they are moving because their leaders told them they 
can no longer protect them," del Mundo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Little evidence has emerged of widespread reprisals against the Hutus by the 
Tutsi minority, and leaders of the rebel front reiterated Monday that Hutus 
have no need to flee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We guarantee all Rwandans stability and security," Maj. Gen. Paul Kagame of 
the RPF said in Kigali, Rwanda's capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Radio Rwanda announced that Pasteur Bizimungu, a Hutu, would be the new 
president and confirmed that Hutu moderate Faustin Twagirimungu would be prime 
minister of a "sufficiently broad-based government of national unity." 
</P>
<P>
 By giving Hutus the two top jobs, the Tutsi-dominated RPF appeared to be 
trying to reassure Hutus they have nothing to fear under a new government 
founded on the armed might of Rwanda's onetime feudal overlords. 
</P>
<P>
 But the cease-fire announced Monday came less than 24 hours after the RPF's 
image was tarnished by mortar attacks in which about 100 civilians, mostly 
Rwandans, were killed inside Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 Panos Moumtzis, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, said 
"strong evidence" indicated the rebels were responsible for the "criminal" 
attack near Goma. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., Kagame said members of 
the Hutu government who took part in the genocidal campaign against the Tutsis 
would be tried and punished. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels want the French to arrest the leaders of the Hutu government. 
France says arresting government leaders is not part of its humanitarian 
mandate.

COLUMN ONE; TOBACCO LAB: SCIENCE AND SILENCE; WHEN THE SMOKING WARS HEATED UP, 
PHILIP MORRIS PUT VICTOR DENOBLE'S NICOTINE EXPERIMENTS ON ICE. HIS STORY IS 
PART OF THE WIDER DRAMA INVOLVING THE INDUSTRY AND ITS RESEARCHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't like entering the Peace Corps, but Victor DeNoble hoped to do some 
good when he joined the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The year was 1980 and DeNoble, then a 30-year-old Ph.D. in experimental 
psychology, accepted an offer to run a secret pharmacology lab for Philip 
Morris Inc., maker of Marlboro and the world's largest cigarette manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 DeNoble was to do research on nicotine's effects on the behavior of rats. But 
the ultimate goal, he said, was the development of synthetic forms of nicotine 
that would give smokers a buzz while avoiding the chemical's injurious effects 
on the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither a smoker nor particular fan of the tobacco industry, DeNoble 
nonetheless said he was intrigued by the chance "to study a very mysterious 
drug" and make a contribution to society. There would always be millions of 
smokers, he believed, so it made sense to reduce their risk of cardiovascular 
disease -- which kills more smokers than lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 But, within a few years, the tobacco wars invaded DeNoble's cloister at the 
Philip Morris research center in Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the other U.S. tobacco giants, Philip Morris suddenly found itself facing 
a wave of smoker-death claims. And as it girded for legal battle, DeNoble's 
research loomed as a serious liability. 
</P>
<P>
 DeNoble had joined an industry deeply ambivalent about such research -- and 
fearful of what might happen should word of it get out. Plaintiffs' lawyers 
might seize upon the work as a tacit admission that smoking was addictive and 
dangerous. Having disputed these contentions for decades, the industry could 
not afford to be caught acting as if it believed them. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Morris -- which declined to respond to questions about DeNoble's 
research or otherwise discuss this story -- abruptly shut the lab in April, 
1984. DeNoble was called in, congratulated on his fine work and told to turn in 
his badge. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to retrieve something a few days later, DeNoble was amazed to find 
no sign the lab had ever existed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was gone," he recalled. "The cages were gone, the animals were 
gone, all the data was gone. It was empty rooms." 
</P>
<P>
 During several months of job-hunting, Philip Morris graciously carried DeNoble 
and fellow scientist Paul C. Mele on its payroll. But the company also muzzled 
them, threatening legal action should they publish their research. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade passed, and the episode might have been buried forever, had word not 
reached the House of Representatives' health and environment subcommittee, 
chaired by tobacco foe Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 When DeNoble and Mele appeared before the panel April 28, Rep. Ron Wyden 
(D-Ore.) said: "Americans ought to be troubled by what we are going to learn 
today, which is that when the tobacco industry does research and the results 
hurt them, the investigators and their data are buttoned up tight." 
</P>
<P>
 Then DeNoble and Mele told their story -- opening a window on an industry that 
painted itself into a corner and did not know how to get out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their unstinting attacks on the evidence against smoking, cigarette 
makers have behaved in private as if they knew better. Internal documents 
produced in lawsuits and leaked from tobacco company files reveal a 
preoccupation with developing "safe" -- or at least much safer -- cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 It was this quest that brought DeNoble and Mele to Philip Morris. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the obvious health advantages, a safer cigarette made good business 
sense. After all, smokers who quit or die cease to be good customers. But what 
the industry would do if it found what it sought was a bit problematic. Here, 
tobacco company scientists and lawyers were not always on the same wavelength. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry lawyers knew that the "safe" cigarette, if one could be developed, 
was a legal and financial minefield. What if they found one but it bombed in 
the marketplace? Would health agencies or Congress, seeing safer smokes were 
possible, nevertheless require the companies to modify their top-selling 
brands? 
</P>
<P>
 And what of the lawsuits that threatened to engulf the industry? As part of 
their successful defense, the cigarette makers had contended there was no 
scientific proof that smoking was dangerous and that any risks that might exist 
were inherent in the product and beyond their control. A "safe" cigarette would 
appear to contradict such claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, internal documents show the companies busily sought the magic bullet. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1960s, '70s, and '80s, they investigated various additives, 
catalysts and tobacco substitutes. Some of these proved superior to regular 
cigarettes in the standard cancer test, which involved painting the skin of 
mice with tars from tobacco smoke. The experimental cigarettes were 
euphemistically described as having reduced "biological activity" -- meaning 
they produced fewer tumors on the skin of the mice than commercial brands. 
</P>
<P>
 Some advances were not meant to be offered to consumers, unless political or 
competitive pressures required them. In a 1985 memo, a Brown & Williamson 
Tobacco Corp. vice president said a prototype cigarette that delivered less 
carbon monoxide had been kept "ready . . . in the event of a marketing need for 
such product." But, he wrote, "right now, we do not see any pressures coming 
from either government agencies or consumer groups." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown & Williamson officials declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly any of these projects made it to market. The rejects included 
"Chemosol," an additive meant to reduce cancer-causing benzopyrene in cigarette 
smoke. Dr. Perry B. Hudson, who tried unsuccessfully to sell the industry on 
the product in the 1960s, said in an interview that he was beaten from the 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 "They couldn't say to the public, in effect, 'These diseases we've been lying 
to you about we now can help you with.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists and consultants for Liggett Group Inc., maker of Chesterfield and 
other brands, poured more than 20 years into developing a catalyst -- made of 
palladium and magnesium nitrate -- that purportedly destroyed cancer-causing 
compounds in cigarette smoke, according to testimony in a New Jersey 
wrongful-death case. 
</P>
<P>
 But project TAME, as it was known inside the company, was abandoned about 1979 
because of litigation fears, according to testimony by Liggett's former 
assistant research director, James D. Mold. "They felt that such a cigarette if 
put on the market would seriously indict them for having sold other types of 
cigarettes," according to Mold, who said in a deposition that he, too, was 
forbidden to publish his research on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer for a top industry law firm elaborated on this theme in 1987 in a 
memo bemoaning the launching of "Premier" -- a virtually smokeless cigarette 
described by its manufacturer, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., as the world's 
"cleanest" brand. 
</P>
<P>
 Premier -- which delivered nicotine and cigarette flavor by heating rather 
than burning tobacco -- could "have significant effects on the tobacco 
industry's joint defense efforts," warned the memo by William S. Ohlmeyer of 
Shook, Hardy & Bacon, lawyers for Philip Morris and other firms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The industry position has always been that there is no alternative design for 
a cigarette as we know them," Ohlmeyer wrote in the leaked memo. 
"Unfortunately, the Reynolds announcement . . . seriously undercuts this 
component of industry's defense." 
</P>
<P>
 If Premier struck Ohlmeyer as a foolish gamble, its fate seemed to underscore 
the point. Smokers hated Premier, and it quickly disappeared. All that legal 
exposure, and the thing didn't even make money. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Victor DeNoble arrived in Richmond, tobacco companies understood 
the importance of nicotine to their business. "They (Philip Morris) clearly 
believed that nicotine was a psychopharmacological agent, and it was the main 
reason that people smoked," DeNoble said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, many in the industry had known this for a very long time. Sir Charles 
Ellis, scientific adviser to the board of directors of British-American 
Tobacco, declared: "We are in a nicotine rather than a tobacco industry," 
according to a 1967 document leaked from Brown & Williamson and recently cited 
before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 In a colorful memo in 1972, Philip Morris psychologist William J. Dunn Jr. -- 
who eight years later would be DeNoble's supervisor -- was equally blunt. 
"Think of the cigarette pack as a storage container for a day's supply of 
nicotine," Dunn wrote. "Think of the cigarette as a dispenser for a dose unit 
of nicotine." 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from its habit-forming properties, however, nicotine also was a health 
hazard. "The Cardiovascular Effects in smoke are believed to be mainly due to 
nicotine and have been thoroughly explored in literature," said a 1963 memo by 
Philip Morris research director Helmut Wakeham -- which, like the Dunn memo, 
later was introduced in court. 
</P>
<P>
 So Philip Morris set about developing nicotine analogues -- compounds that 
would have the effects on the brain of nicotine without the cardiovascular 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
 DeNoble's role was to study nicotine's effects on the behavior of rats. These 
results would guide the testing of the analogue compounds. He recruited Mele, a 
behavioral pharmacologist. 
</P>
<P>
 They found that nicotine met two hallmarks of potential addiction -- 
"self-administration," in that rats would press levers to inject themselves 
with a nicotine solution, and "tolerance," in that a given dose of nicotine 
over time had a reduced effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The work was to remain secret even from fellow Philip Morris scientists, 
DeNoble said; test animals were delivered at dawn and brought from the loading 
dock to the lab under cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it seemed as though "the company was truly interested in investigating 
their product (and) improving it," Mele recalled in an interview. "They seemed 
to want to know about it with a kind of no-holds-barred attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 That changed by 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Several wrongful death claims had been filed against tobacco companies, and 
dozens more were on the way. Nicotine dependence was a crucial issue in these 
cases. Although tobacco lawyers argued that smokers had ignored warning labels 
and accepted the risk, plaintiffs claimed they were hooked. The U.S. surgeon 
general would pronounce nicotine addictive, but that was five years away. 
</P>
<P>
 With the litigation heating up, DeNoble was called to Philip Morris' New York 
headquarters in June, 1983, to brief top executives on his work. 
</P>
<P>
 He recalled one asking, " 'Why should I risk a billion-dollar industry on rats 
pressing levers for nicotine?' My comment was, 'I have no idea,' " DeNoble 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, one of DeNoble's associates told him he thought the meeting went well. 
On the return flight to Richmond on the corporate jet, DeNoble remembered 
thinking, " 'Boy, these guys can really play poker,' because I couldn't read 
the emotions of the day." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, however, company lawyers were prowling the lab and reviewing research 
notebooks. "We were told the data we were generating . . . could be dangerous 
to the company," DeNoble said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was talk of killing the research or moving it outside so the company 
would be freer to disavow the results. One scenario had DeNoble and Mele 
leaving the payroll and continuing as contractors, DeNoble testified to 
Congress. Another involved shifting the work to a lab in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier that year, the company had approved DeNoble's and Mele's request to 
publish some of their data; their paper had been accepted by the journal 
Psychopharmacology. But DeNoble was told in August to withdraw the article, 
which he did with a letter to journal Editor Herbert Barry III. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company didn't want their own scientists to be publishing information 
that would indicate that nicotine was an addictive drug (or) that it was 
harmful in any way," Barry recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Withdrawal of the paper coincided with the filing of the landmark Cipollone 
lawsuit in New Jersey on Aug. 1, 1983. A longtime smoker, Rose Cipollone had 
contracted lung cancer. Before her death at 58, she sued Philip Morris and two 
other firms whose brands she smoked. 
</P>
<P>
 The case ultimately produced the first verdict against a tobacco company -- a 
$400,000 judgment against Liggett in 1988 that was overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Morris and Lorillard Inc. were found not liable -- in part because 
jurors did not believe allegations that Cipollone was hooked or that the 
cigarette makers had deliberately concealed information about nicotine 
addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not it might have affected the outcome, the DeNoble-Mele paper 
could have helped the Cipollone family's case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can certainly see why they (Philip Morris) would be worried about having 
this published," Cynthia Walters, one of the Cipollone lawyers, said in a 
recent interview. "The jury didn't buy addiction as to Rose Cipollone. . . . 
They didn't believe that she couldn't stop smoking, so any additional 
information that it (smoking) is addictive would have been helpful." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite withdrawal of the paper, DeNoble's and Mele's work continued, and for 
a while it seemed that the storm had passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in early April, 1984, DeNoble said, he was called into the office of his 
boss, Jim Charles, manager of biochemical research. DeNoble previously had been 
promoted to associate senior scientist, and when Charles began by extolling his 
work, DeNoble thought he was about to be promoted again. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the bombshell: It was strictly a business decision, but the lab would be 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the world of scientific research, good jobs are hard to come by, and the 
first concern of DeNoble and Mele was how to make a living. Fortunately, Philip 
Morris paid their salaries for months until they found new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Over time, however, the men grew frustrated and angry about suppression of 
their data. 
</P>
<P>
 On arriving at Philip Morris, each had signed an agreement to seek permission 
before disclosing their research. They knew that Philip Morris, or any company, 
might have a legitimate need to hold back information about new products. But 
in the realm of science, publication is the key to advancement -- of knowledge 
and careers. And they believed Philip Morris' veto had nothing to do with 
competitive needs. 
</P>
<P>
 So DeNoble and Mele began planning ways to get their data out. In April, 1986, 
they made a presentation at a meeting in St. Louis of the Federation of 
American Societies for Experimental Biology. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Morris found out, and a company lawyer sent a scolding letter. "In the 
future," it said, "you are expected to comply with the terms of the agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 That August, they gave another presentation at a meeting of the American 
Psychological Assn. in Washington. Frank Ryan, a former colleague, was sent by 
Philip Morris to snap their pictures -- after which the three men went out for 
supper and beers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Philip Morris wasn't fooling around. "The Company cannot tolerate this 
type of conduct," warned a second letter from assistant general counsel Eric A. 
Taussig. "Any further breach of your agreement will result in action being 
taken." 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing they would be overwhelmed by legal bills in a fight with Philip 
Morris, DeNoble and Mele backed down. They told Taussig that they had 
resubmitted the 1983 paper to Psychopharmacology, and that it soon would be 
published. Taussig told them to withdraw it, and they did. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to realize that I'm looking at a very large corporation . . . 
telling me that they're going to tie me up in court for a long time," DeNoble 
said recently. "I got scared, bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Years passed, and the story might never have been publicly revealed. But it 
came to light earlier this year, when the Food and Drug Administration 
announced it was considering regulating nicotine as a drug. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Henningfield, chief of clinical pharmacology for the National Institute 
on Drug Abuse, belonged to some of the same professional societies as DeNoble 
and had been told in 1983 about the squelching of the data. In March, when FDA 
Commissioner Dr. David A. Kessler mentioned a rumor that a tobacco company had 
done nicotine self-administration studies with rats, Henningfield recalled the 
incident and told Kessler about it. Kessler and Henningfield provided details 
to the Waxman panel in an appearance later that month. 
</P>
<P>
 At the subcommittee's request, Philip Morris waived the secrecy requirement, 
and DeNoble and Mele agreed to appear. Their testimony helped fan the firestorm 
of criticism that has engulfed the industry this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Mele, 45, and DeNoble, 44, have gone on to other things. Mele is a researcher 
at the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute in Bethesda, Md. DeNoble is 
a behavioral analyst in Delaware's Department of Mental Retardation. But for 
both the appearance was cathartic -- providing a sense of vindication and of 
closure. 
</P>
<P>
 It proved to be "a good way to let the (scientific) community know what was 
going on at Philip Morris, without getting on '60 Minutes' or anything like 
that," Mele said. "We weren't interested in being on a soapbox and trying to 
make them look bad." How Smoking Kills 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, Victor DeNoble was part of a Philip Morris research project 
aimed at developing a nicotine substitute -- a chemical that would give smokers 
a jolt without subjecting them to the cardiovascular effects of nicotine. 
Health experts say that cardiovascular disease not cancer -- is the No. 1 
killer associated with smoking. Chart shows estimates of smoking-related deaths 
in the United States in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardiovascular Disease, including ischemic heart disease--179,820; (43%) 
</P>
<P>
 Cancer, including lung cancer--151,322; (36%) 
</P>

 Building their case against murder suspect John Joseph Famalaro, Arizona and 
Costa Mesa authorities have recovered clothing believed to have been worn by 
Denise Huber the night she vanished from Orange County three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The articles of clothing, a black mini-skirt and other articles, were 
discovered in a box inside Famalaro's cluttered Prescott Country Club home. 
They were identified by Costa Mesa police and could be key evidence linking the 
suspect with the Newport Beach woman, whose nude body was found frozen in the 
back of a stolen rental truck parked in his driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators on Monday also interviewed employees of a San Clemente 
self-storage facility where Famalaro rented seven units from July, 1992 -- a 
year after Huber disappeared -- to February of this year. Famalaro contracted 
to have constant power maintained to the locker where he kept his personal 
belongings, including a freezer that may have been the one in which Huber's 
body was discovered last week, said Harry Tosado, facility manager of Allsize 
Self-Storage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole time the freezer was here, he wanted 24-hour electricity, which 
people here thought was very odd," Tosado said. "It's written right on the 
contract, '24 hours.' " 
</P>
<P>
 When Famalaro moved the last of his belongings out of the facility in 
February, he asked the employees to help load the freezer onto his truck 
without delay. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he had a generator on his truck that would keep the freezer running 
while he was driving, but the main thing was, he wanted it loaded real quick," 
Tosado said. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery of the clothing and other personal effects, meanwhile, has led 
authorities to consider filing an additional charge of kidnaping against 
Famalaro, said Costa Mesa Police Lt. Ron Smith, which would make it a capital 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 There were these other developments Monday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Authorities were investigating the source of the freezer, and believe it may 
have been bought at a Montgomery Ward store in the Orange County area shortly 
after Huber's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fingerprints have been lifted from the freezer, and officials were 
attempting to match those to Famalaro. 
</P>
<P>
 * A Yavapai County Grand Jury prepared to consider an indictment in the case 
as early as Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Famalaro's defense attorney, Lawrence W. Katz, said he is upset by 
the frenzied attention to his client. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a total circumstance case," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 In discussing the evidence accumulating in the investigation, Yavapai County 
Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Laurie Berra said there did not appear to be 
any effort to conceal the clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 New details about the condition of Huber's frozen body also emerged Monday, 
including that the brown-haired woman was found face down inside the 
23-cubic-foot Signature brand freezer. Her hands were handcuffed behind her, 
Yavapai County Sheriff G.C. (Buck) Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Huber appeared to have suffered 10 to 12 blows and cuts on 
the head, consistent with injuries inflicted by a hammer or crowbar. Smith said 
there were no signs of sexual abuse. 
</P>

Reyes contributed to this story.

ANTI-SMOG PROPOSAL WOULD HOBBLE TRANSIT AND SHIPPING, INDUSTRIES SAY; 
POLLUTION: CRITICS OF FEDERAL PLAN VOICE CONCERNS BUT FEW ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS 
AT EPA HEARING. A COMPROMISE STRATEGY MAY BE DEVELOPED IN BEHIND-THE-SCENES 
MEETINGS OF ENVIRONMENTALISTS, BUSINESSES AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.

 California industries on Monday painted a grim picture of what would happen 
under the Clinton Administration's far-reaching plan to clean up the Los 
Angeles region's smog, saying it would force airlines, truckers, railroads and 
ships to severely reduce transport of cargo and passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 The assessment came as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency kicked off a 
week of hearings to gauge reaction to its sweeping anti-smog strategy. The 
proposal marks the first time the federal government has stepped into the 
decades-long fray over how to clean up the region's air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA's involvement came only after the federal agency lost a 10-year legal 
battle. Los Angeles-area environmentalists had filed suit to force the federal 
government to step in after local and state officials failed for two decades to 
comply with the federal Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Targeting the four-county Los Angeles Basin as well as the Sacramento area and 
Ventura County, the 1,600 pages of proposed rules would control pollution from 
virtually everything -- airliners and lawn mowers, giant aerospace factories 
and small auto mechanic shops, paints and pesticides, livestock manure and 
bakeries. The EPA estimates that the cost of cleaning the air will be $4 
billion annually in the four counties, plus $150 million a year each for the 
Sacramento area and Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA's proposed regulations would primarily affect sources of smog that 
have gone relatively unregulated -- ships, railroads, airlines, interstate 
trucks and recreational boats. 
</P>
<P>
 One controversial rule would require airlines to comply with a pollution limit 
for aircraft and ground operations that declines annually by 4% to 9%. Another 
requires ships to pay fees upon docking based on how clean-burning their 
engines are. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the estimated 75 speakers at Monday's hearing in Diamond Bar said they 
resented federal intrusion into an issue historically left to local and state 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like every Californian, we all want cleaner air," said Monrovia Mayor Bob 
Bartlett. "But turning the state upside down to support bureaucratic 
regulations without any guarantee of achieving the goal is, forgive me, crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a plea from EPA regional director Felicia Marcus to offer options and 
not just criticism, only a few speakers offered alternatives for cleaning the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to know how to construct a better plan," Marcus said. 
</P>
<P>
 Away from the hearings, however, the real work of forging consensus on a plan 
is occurring behind the scenes at small meetings of business leaders, 
environmentalists and EPA officials. At those sessions, participants are trying 
to hammer out options over the next month that would impose the least economic 
pain on a recession-weary state. 
</P>
<P>
 The attempts at collaboration -- which are noteworthy because all sides have 
been at odds for years over how to control smog -- are viewed as a last-ditch 
effort. The EPA is required by court order to have a plan that achieves 
pollution standards in the region by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus said the agency's final smog rules, due Feb. 14, may differ 
dramatically from the current proposal because industry seems to be working on 
"some creative options." 
</P>
<P>
 Airline officials said Monday that if the proposed rules were enforced, 
flights at the Los Angeles region's five airports would have to be reduced by 
40% to 60% by 2005, which would inconvenience travelers, cost the local economy 
$35 billion a year and eliminate 345,000 jobs, according to the Air Transport 
Assn. Many airlines, for example, might have to consolidate operations at Los 
Angeles International Airport and cut flights at Orange County and the other 
outlying terminals, airport officials testified. 
</P>
<P>
 The trucking, railroad and shipping industries described similar consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation officials said, for instance, that the cost of shipping goods 
by sea to Los Angeles would increase 200% to 300% and that Los Angeles and Long 
Beach harbors would lose business to ports that do not face smog fees, such as 
San Diego. The Los Angeles Harbor Department has suggested that in place of 
imposing smog fees, the EPA could reduce onshore pollution by telling shippers 
to use ocean corridors farther offshore. 
</P>
<P>
 California truckers said the EPA's requirement for cleaner-burning truck 
engines could cost $5 billion a year just for truckers based in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think this is what President Clinton had in mind when he promised to 
help us rebuild after the earthquakes and fires and riots," said Karen 
Rasmussen, vice president of the California Trucking Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, some local businesses, most notably the Southern California Gas 
Co., applauded the plan, saying it finally shifts some of the burden away from 
factories in the Southland that already have taken expensive steps to curb 
smog. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA's Marcus said many industries are "assuming the worst" and said the 
agency would "absolutely not" enact a rule if, for example, the airline 
industry showed that it would have to eliminate half its flights to comply. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not interested in harming commerce," she said. "From the beginning we 
said, 'Here's what we propose, tell us if it makes sense.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Veronica Kun of the Natural Resources Defense Council called attacks on the 
plan "a lot of rhetoric and narrow self-interest," adding that 
behind-the-scenes talks are much less polarized. The environmentalists stressed 
that cleaning the air would revitalize, not harm, the economy because it would 
mean new transportation and pollution-control technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus said the EPA's hope is that local and state air quality officials will 
come up with suitable rules so the federal government can drop out. But 
environmentalists warned the EPA not to back off too soon, since, according to 
Coalition for Clean Air President Tom Soto, state efforts "seem to be driven by 
election-year politics."

<P>
 The sharp exchange took place during their first appearances on the same 
program since the general election campaign began and signaled the likelihood 
of a bitter battle for the California governorship. The contenders have been 
pummeling each other in television commercials since before the June 8 primary 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the serene backdrop of a golf course dotted with Monterey pines, 
Wilson and Brown each talked for 15 minutes to the annual convention of the 
California Broadcasters' Assn. at the Hyatt Regency Resort. They fielded 
questions from the radio and television executives and then carried their 
acrimonious exchange into separate meetings with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, this was not a debate, since they never were in the room at the 
same time. And it still is early in the summer, the traditional lull in 
election campaigns. But Monday's encounter had all the drama and rhetorical 
fire of a face-to-face clash in the final days before the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and Wilson hit all the major issues that are likely to figure in the 
campaign: the state budget, taxes, the economy, welfare, illegal immigration, 
public education, crime and the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking first, Brown made it clear she intends to carry the campaign attack 
to Wilson, comparing his record to the promises he made in winning his first 
term in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did anything, said anything and stopped at nothing to get your votes back 
then," Brown said. "He's going to do the same thing today. . . . I'm going to 
hold him accountable for taking California from first to worst." 
</P>
<P>
 She capsulized her own campaign more crisply and concisely than perhaps at any 
other time this year in three short paragraphs covering job development, 
revitalization of the schools and getting tougher on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Wilson has had his chance, and he has failed," she said. "That is the 
issue of this campaign, and I intend to take that indictment throughout this 
state." 
</P>
<P>
 When it was his turn, Wilson defended his record by claiming the state has 
made progress in spite of great obstacles, including the recession and the 
federal government's refusal to compensate California for the costs of 
providing services that Congress requires be offered to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson called again for tough enforcement of border control laws and decried 
the cost to the state of providing services to illegal immigrants. He also said 
California must wage a tough new campaign against young, unmarried women having 
children, because they so often wind up on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson accused Brown of inconsistency on issues such as the North American 
Free Trade Agreement. He said she would hurt job creation by raising taxes, and 
claimed she was trying to overcome her weakness on crime by running a "lurid 
and ludicrous" television campaign commercial attacking Wilson's parole 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 After Brown boarded her campaign bus for a two-day trip named "the 1994 Pete 
Wilson Broken Promises Tour," she said Wilson's ads attacking her were "lurid 
and unfair." 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm not whining," she said. "I think he's whining. He should take his 
(anti-Wilson) commercials like a man." 
</P>
<P>
 In his session with reporters, Wilson said Brown's positions on crime, 
including her personal opposition to the death penalty, are "greatly out of 
step with the people of California and I think that they would agree her 
priorities are those of an ACLU liberal who is weak on crime." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Brown once helped raise funds for the American Civil Liberties Union, 
which often initiates lawsuits in an effort to protect the legal rights of 
criminal defendants and others. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to questions, Brown said she is not a member of the ACLU, but 
attended an ACLU fund-raising event by invitation to present an award. 
</P>
<P>
 The death penalty was the final question put to Brown during the session with 
the broadcasters, and the candidate responded heatedly that she is unable to 
change her personal opposition to capital punishment, but said, "It's a law I 
will respect and uphold." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said she understands why the death penalty enjoys overwhelming support 
among California voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got kids," she said. "I've got grandkids, and if anybody tried to hurt 
one of my kids, I'd want punishment. But I was taught (the death penalty) was 
not right." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson argued that it isn't a matter of upholding the law, as Brown insists 
she will do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Governors don't enforce the death penalty," he said. "They either grant or 
withhold clemency." 
</P>
<P>
 The governor added that someone with the same feelings about capital 
punishment as Brown "would find a way to grant (clemency) simply as a means of 
avoiding a death penalty in which they don't conscientiously believe." 
</P>
<P>
 Again he noted that Brown's brother, Jerry, appointed the controversial Rose 
Elizabeth Bird as chief justice when he was governor of California, adding: 
"The last person who told us she would enforce the death penalty was Chief 
Justice Bird and then subsequently, in 53 decisions, found ways to avoid doing 
so by making evidence inadmissible on technicalities." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown responded to Wilson's "ACLU liberal" charge by saying he is trying to 
inject ideology into the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you can put a label on me or my campaign," she said. "I 
represent a philosophy of making government work for the people." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, when one reporter noted that she had differed with liberal Democrats 
in the Legislature on budget priorities, Brown said, "I think it's important to 
have a Democrat who is willing to stand tough on welfare reform, stand tough on 
crime and who will be a fighter for education and a fighter for the middle 
class." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, she said, is trying to avoid accountability for his record. "It is 
typical smoke and mirror politics when the people of the state are looking for 
real answers, real solutions to the difficult and complex problems of 
California. I don't buy it. I don't think they're going to buy it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said Monday's pointed attacks illustrate that there are basic 
differences between the two candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what campaigns are all about," he said.

STUDY FINDS LATINOS TO BE GROUP MOST LACKING IN HEALTH COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS P. SHUIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

 Latinos are almost twice as likely as other Californians to be without medical 
insurance, even though nearly nine out of 10 uninsured Latinos come from 
families with at least one wage earner, according to a UCLA study released 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 While past studies have shown that medical insurance was a major health need 
for Latinos, the new research provides the most comprehensive look yet at the 
problem. The study was compiled by the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research 
under a grant from the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of who has and who does not have health insurance is particularly 
critical in Los Angeles County, which has more uninsured people than any other 
metropolitan area, ranking last among the 30 largest urban areas in the United 
States, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Past studies by various health authorities have clearly established that 
people without health insurance place huge financial and caseload burdens on 
public hospitals and generally arrive at the hospitals suffering from more 
acute illnesses because they did not receive preventive care or early 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 "This study shows the huge stake Latinos in California have in the national 
health reform debate," said Drew E. Altman, president of the Kaiser Family 
Foundation. "No group stands to benefit more from expanded health insurance." 
</P>
<P>
 A chief finding of the study was that 39% of non-elderly Latinos are 
completely uninsured, meaning they are not covered either by private insurance 
or Medi-Cal, compared to 23% of all non-elderly Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 The authors of the study said the finding that 87% of uninsured Latinos come 
from families with at least one wage earner flies in the face of popular 
notions among Americans that most uninsured are unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a common misconception that the uninsured are unemployed," said 
Gerald F. Kominski, associate director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy 
Research. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the uninsured usually end up at public hospital facilities, Kominski 
said "the taxpayers of California are subsidizing employers who choose not to 
provide health insurance for their employees." 
</P>
<P>
 The study found that 37% of non-elderly Latinos have health insurance through 
their own job or a family member's employment, compared to 54% of all 
non-elderly Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 Working Latinos are less likely to have medical insurance than other 
non-elderly Californians because they tend to work for small firms in the 
agriculture, retail or service industries that are less likely to cover their 
employees, the study showed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the study focused on Latinos, Kominski said other ethnic and racial 
minorities also showed up with disproportionately high numbers of uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issues are most extreme in the Latino population," Kominski said, "but 
the same issues apply to the African American population and also to Asians to 
some extent." 
</P>
<P>
 Release of the study came at a seminar on health issues facing diverse ethnic 
and racial communities in Southern California that was sponsored by the 
National Press Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Lester Breslow, of the UCLA School of Public Health, said that there was 
an alarming increase in some communities of preventable health problems, such 
as tuberculosis, which he said is now 2 1/2 times more common in Los Angeles 
County than in the United States as a whole.

AUDITOR FINDS LOTTERY BROKE CONTRACT POLICY; GOVERNMENT: BID SPECIFICATIONS FOR 
ITS COMPUTER SYSTEM WERE SO RESTRICTIVE THAT ONLY ONE COMPANY COULD MEET THEM, 
REPORT SAYS. WITHOUT COMPETITION, GTECH GOT A PACT WITH AN ESTIMATED VALUE OF 
$600 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The California Lottery, in violation of its own policies, eliminated any 
competition for one the biggest contracts in state history by making bid 
specifications so restrictive that only one company could meet them, the state 
auditor found in a report issued Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignoring warnings from her own finance director and complaints from 
competitors, former Director Sharon Sharp insisted on a time schedule for 
delivering a new system to operate the lottery's computerized games that was so 
short no company other than the current contractor, GTECH Corp. of Rhode 
Island, could reasonably comply with it, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, state Auditor Kurt Sjoberg said, no other companies responded to 
a request for bids and GTECH without competition won a contract in April, 1993, 
that has been estimated to have a potential value of $600 million. The contract 
provides for the operation and installation of a computer system to run five 
games of chance -- Super Lotto, Decco, Fantasy Five, Daily 3 and Keno. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because the restrictive implementation schedules limited competition to a 
single vendor, the lottery could not be assured that it received the best 
on-line gaming system at the best price," Sjoberg wrote in a 40-page report. 
</P>
<P>
 Sjoberg said that after GTECH won the contract, the company was not able to 
deliver all the bid requirements by the Oct. 13, 1993, deadline set by Sharp, 
although it did install a new computer system and have it operating by then. As 
recently as May, 1994, he said, 19% of items the contract had required had not 
been delivered by GTECH and accepted by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Sjoberg's criticism comes as the state's contracting procedures in general and 
its handling of computer contracts in particular have come under fire. It 
bolsters critics in the Legislature who contend that the Wilson Administration 
has not provided adequate oversight of state government's multibillion-dollar 
computer network. The Department of Motor Vehicles disclosed this year that it 
was abandoning a $44-million computer project because it did not function 
adequately. 
</P>
<P>
 The auditor's report not only countered the lottery's contention that the 
175-day timetable for installing the new computer system was standard for the 
industry, but also raised questions about the role played by the five appointed 
lottery commissioners who oversee lottery operations. It said that the agency 
turned a deaf ear to rival companies that repeatedly complained that the time 
schedule was too short, and to lottery Finance Director Gordon Jones, who 
warned in numerous memos that the agency was moving down a path that would 
discourage competition. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Gov. Pete Wilson, who requested the audit, said the 
Administration has been aware of contracting problems at the lottery and has 
already taken steps to improve oversight by the commission. He said the panel 
has established subcommittees with specific responsibilities for monitoring 
contracting procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 "The governor's management policy is that if there appears to be a problem to 
review it openly and honestly, and that is why he called for this audit," said 
press secretary Sean Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the audit found that the time schedule for completing the contract 
stifled competition, Walsh noted that it had determined that the ultimate price 
agreed upon with GTECH was "within industry standards." The contract calls for 
GTECH to receive 2.9% of the sales from computerized games. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to comment on the criticism of Sharp or the commission, observing 
only that "clearly the Lottery Commission needs to be vigilant and will be 
vigilant in monitoring the lottery." He said Sharp, who resigned under pressure 
late last year, has been replaced by an "excellent manager," interim Director 
A. A. Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Legislature, Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), one of the most vocal 
critics of the lottery's handling of the computer contract, said he was pleased 
with the audit results, although he complained that they did not go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "This completely blows the rationale for giving one of the biggest contracts 
in state history to a monopoly contractor named GTECH," he said. "And I think 
it does blow up the rationale that had been previously given that the losers 
were merely sour-grape whiners." 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the report was narrow in its focus and did not explain the reasons 
behind the lottery's insistence on a short time schedule that clearly favored 
one company. 
</P>
<P>
 The auditor's report criticized Sharp and the commission for following without 
question the advice of a consultant, Battelle Memorial Institute, which 
recommended the time schedule and insisted it was standard for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the lottery had questioned Battelle about the source of its advice before 
the final (bid specification) was issued, the lottery would have found that 
Battelle's information was not based on any critical analysis," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his own analysis, Sjoberg said he studied eight lotteries in other states 
that had recently let computer contracts and found six of them provided a 
longer time schedule to install a data system. He said two states had shorter 
time schedules but their contracts were not as complex as California's. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the lottery's handling of the contract violated its own policies, 
which require that it ensure that there be competition for contracts.

SEOUL TAKES PARTING SHOT AT KIM; ASIA: 2 MILLION REPORTEDLY GATHER FOR NORTH 
KOREAN LEADER'S FUNERAL. SOUTH'S PREMIER ASSAILS THE LATE PRESIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A day before North Korea bade farewell to the cult hero who enjoyed god-like 
status ruling the Stalinist nation throughout its 46-year history, South Korea 
on Monday condemned the late President Kim Il Sung as instigator of the 1950-53 
Korean War and perpetrator of national division. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korean Prime Minister Lee Yung Duk made the statement after meeting with 
his Cabinet. The government, he said, will take "stern action" against citizens 
who violate the National Security Law by "expressing condolences over Kim's 
death or extolling his rule." 
</P>
<P>
 Naewoe Press, a South Korean government-operated news agency that monitors 
North Korean media, reported that radio and TV stations in the North broadcast 
taped recordings of the funeral this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Jong Il, 52, the late president's eldest son, Defense Minister O Jin U, 
Prime Minister Kang Song San, all four vice presidents and Foreign Minister Kim 
Yong Nam attended. Two million citizens gathered for the ceremony, North Korean 
media reported. 
</P>
<P>
 A vehicle bearing Kim's body circled Kim Il Sung Square and Pyongyang's main 
streets in a procession of more than 30 cars, North Korean media said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony, originally scheduled for Sunday, was postponed for two days to 
allow more mourners to pay respects and to view Kim's body, which had lain in 
state at the presidential palace in Pyongyang, North Korean media announced 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Korean prime minister's condemnation of Kim Il Sung, although mild 
in its terminology, overturned an earlier government decision to refrain from 
remarks that might provoke North Korea during its mourning over the death of 
its 82-year-old leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee condemned four opposition legislators and the few dissidents and student 
activists who last week urged that condolences and delegations be dispatched to 
North Korea. Lee said the proposals represented a "regrettable, thoughtless 
attitude that ignores grim historical facts." 
</P>
<P>
 South Korean President Kim Young Sam, meanwhile, called in presidents and 
deans of universities to tell them his government would no longer tolerate "a 
handful of student extremists who are becoming more and more radical and 
violent." This morning, police arrested 39 students at the national 
headquarters of the University Students Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Lee said South Korea still wants to hold a first-ever summit of North 
and South Korean leaders, the mood of reconciliation that arose after former 
President Jimmy Carter helped arrange a meeting between Kim Il Sung and Kim 
Young Sam already is fading fast. The summit, which was scheduled for next 
Monday, was postponed after Kim Il Sung died. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, when Pyongyang invited Koreans from South Korea and other 
countries to attend the funeral, the Seoul government banned such trips to the 
North. That move, in turn, induced Pyongyang to condemn Kim Young Sam. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot consider that the South Korean chief executive is of the same blood 
as our compatriots," the North Korean Central News Agency said in a dispatch 
Sunday. "Our nation will surely settle accounts with him for his towering 
crime, which will be cursed down through generations." 
</P>
<P>
 Although North Korea said last week that its officials would contact U.S. 
representatives in New York after Kim's funeral to set a date to resume talks 
over the North Korean nuclear program, neither the North nor the South has 
proposed discussions to set a new date for a summit. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea still has not revealed when it will announce its new leadership, 
expected to be headed by the reclusive Kim Jong Il, who has been groomed for 
two decades for the Communist world's first hereditary succession. 
</P>
<P>
 A special memorial ceremony has been scheduled Wednesday at which the South 
Koreans say the younger Kim will speak; he has said nothing in public since his 
father's death July 8. Indeed, it is reported that he has been heard uttering 
only one sentence in public during his entire life.

JAPAN PREMIER ADVOCATES MORE 'CARING' NATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA WATANABE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama urged Japan "not to be a powerful country but 
a caring country" in an inaugural speech Monday that aimed to back away from 
moves to increase this nation's military muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama, the Socialist Party chairman who was elected prime minister June 29 
in a shotgun marriage with the conservative Liberal Democrats, also reaffirmed 
the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty in language stronger than his party has ever 
used. The Socialists had long opposed the treaty until a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In his address to the lower house of Parliament, Murayama sidestepped the 
delicate question of whether he believes Japan's Self-Defense Forces are 
constitutional. But in separate remarks later Monday, he said he had asked his 
party to overcome its 50-year opposition to the nation's military forces and 
officially recognize them as legal. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his party deputy, Wataru Kubo, declared on a weekend news show that 
the Socialists are ready to make the policy turnabout and change their 
platform, the party has not formally decided to do so. A decision to overturn a 
position that has largely defined the Socialists for almost five decades could 
force several of the leftist members to quit the party. 
</P>
<P>
 The military issue is likely to be the focal point of the opposition's harsh 
grilling of Murayama in parliamentary questioning that begins Wednesday. It 
will be the first time he will be forced to explain to his former political 
allies how he could abandon party principles and join his erstwhile rivals, the 
Liberal Democrats, in what the press here is calling an "illicit union." 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama, for instance, pledged in his speech that his government would 
"firmly maintain" the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. But the Socialists had 
refused to accept that strong phrase when it was allied with the previous 
coalition government, complained its former prime minister, Tsutomu Hata. 
</P>
<P>
 As with most inaugural speeches, Murayama was short on specifics. He pledged 
to do his best to enact tax reform by year's end but gave no clue about how to 
raise the revenue needed to finance more tax cuts. He announced he would draw 
up a "five-year deregulation plan" but gave no details. 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama reaffirmed his government's intent to finalize legislation that would 
redraw electoral districts and hold elections under the new blueprint. He said 
he would sponsor new measures to crack down on political corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 He indicated that the government would slow its drive to win a permanent seat 
on the U.N. Security Council. Key members of the Murayama Cabinet, such as 
Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura of the New Party Harbinger, oppose Japan's 
membership. 
</P>
<P>
 But Murayama's buzzwords of the day were "a caring government" and "a 
government you can feel at ease with." The phrases were interpreted as blows 
against political rival Ichiro Ozawa's aim to make Japan a "normal nation" more 
willing to dispatch military forces to global hot spots in cooperation with the 
United Nations.

MIDEAST PEACE NEAR, CHRISTOPHER SAYS; DIPLOMACY: CONTINUED TALKS OFFER HOPE. 
BUT ISRAEL NOT AS OPTIMISTIC AS U.S. ABOUT PROGRESS WITH SYRIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN WRIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 On the first day of his sixth Mideast shuttle, Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher talked with Israeli leaders Monday and predicted that the peace 
process is close to realizing its goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Arab-Israeli conflict, one of the most longstanding and most intractable 
conflicts of this entire century, is drawing to an end," he said after meeting 
with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. "There will be difficulties on the 
path ahead. But, nonetheless, we're proceeding to assist the parties and they 
are proceeding with great determination." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher called his weeklong trip before next Monday's planned summit 
between Rabin and Jordan's King Hussein in Washington "these historic seven 
days." 
</P>
<P>
 But there was little tangible progress to back up his optimism. While Israeli 
officials are encouraged by the momentum created with the latest breakthrough 
on the Jordanian negotiating front, they said Monday they did not share U.S. 
optimism about progress with Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher is scheduled to meet today and again Friday with Syrian President 
Hafez Assad, now the major holdout in the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can always hope, but there's nothing to give us hope of any major movement 
any time soon," an Israeli official said. Christopher will not carry any 
compromises to break the impasse with Syria, officials added. 
</P>
<P>
 In Damascus, a Syrian official said Monday that the Assad government is 
prepared to help break the impasse. "Syria is ready to discuss everything which 
might help push the peace process toward its objectives, which are the 
achievement of a just and comprehensive settlement," an official spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said Monday their optimism about prospects for peace in the 
region stems, in part, from behind-the-scenes progress in talks between Israel 
and the Arab world that have quietly been under way since January, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, progress has been made in talks with more than a dozen 
countries on a host of regional problems -- producing the first, critical phase 
of normalization with the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
 The talks, which have brought Israeli officials to meetings in a number of 
Arab countries for the first time, have now moved from theoretical discussions 
to concrete projects "which bear significantly on the long-term peace, 
stability and prosperity of the region," the State Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the talks moved to Arab capitals last fall, Israeli officials have made 
groundbreaking trips to spots such as Morocco, Tunisia, Oman and Qatar. 
</P>
<P>
 As a complement to talks between Israel and its Arab neighbors, the other Arab 
working groups are removing psychological barriers and taking practical steps 
to create a new, post-peace Middle East, said Daniel Kurtzer, deputy assistant 
secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
 Each group -- on arms control, economic development, environment, water 
resources and refugees -- is nearing consensus on a course of action, he said. 
They are developing plans to create a regional environmental authority to deal 
with problems in the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Aqaba and the Mediterranean Sea 
and a regional water authority. One study seeks to define a common vision of 
the post-peace Mideast and how it will link Israel and the Arab world in 
everything from roads and trade to energy and communications.

ADMINISTRATION TO RETAIN BAN ON POT THERAPY

 The Clinton Administration will not relax a prohibition against the medical 
uses of marijuana because the scientific evidence is still insufficient to 
prove its therapeutic value, federal health officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 They said, however, that they would welcome controlled clinical trials that 
could further evaluate the drug's medical potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sound scientific studies . . . are lacking despite anecdotal claims that 
smoked marijuana is beneficial," said Dr. Philip R. Lee, assistant secretary 
for health, in a letter to Rep. Dan Hamburg (D-Ukiah), one of several lawmakers 
who had requested a policy review. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1976 until 1992, the federal government had allowed a small number of 
individuals on a case-by-case basis to take the illegal drug for medicinal 
purposes. These included relieving the nausea and appetite loss that is often a 
side effect of cancer and AIDS therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 But in March, 1992, the George Bush Administration discontinued the program, 
saying that the drug's therapeutic value was unproven and that it could, in 
fact, cause harm to some patients because its use was associated with lung 
disease and other problems.

HAITI REFUGEE COUNT DROPS TO ZERO; CARIBBEAN: OFFICIALS REPORT NO SEA RESCUES 
DURING LAST THREE DAYS. REVERSAL OF U.S. POLICY CREDITED FOR SHARP DECLINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The surge of Haitian refugees -- which once threatened to swamp the U.S. 
immigration system and figured as a key element in justifying a U.S. invasion 
-- has dropped to insignificance, at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no reports over the weekend of U.S. vessels rescuing Haitians 
fleeing their homeland by sea, said U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Shrager, who 
noted: "The number on Saturday was zero. The number on Sunday was zero." 
</P>
<P>
 And officials in Washington said no Haitians were rescued Monday -- a stunning 
change since the first week of July, when 12,345 Haitians were picked up by 
U.S. Coast Guard vessels; more than 3,300 Haitian refugees were intercepted on 
July 4 alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The earlier flight evidently was driven by the then-applicable Clinton 
Administration policy, under which any Haitians picked up at sea were to 
receive quick processing on requests for refugee status. As such they enjoyed a 
better chance of being allowed to enter the United States. This stance was a 
sharp reversal from the previous policy, under which almost every refugee found 
at sea was returned to Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new immigration directive apparently helped push thousands of Haitians 
to take to rickety craft in a desperate, largely futile search for a better 
life in America or other international aid. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation rapidly became a crisis, especially after exiled Haitian 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide refused to urge his countrymen to stay home, 
leading some Americans to engage in shrill talk about a stepped-up schedule for 
a U.S. military intervention here, in part to stem the immigration problem. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton had listed the Haitian refugee problem as one of the crucial 
U.S. interests that could justify armed intervention. Some diplomats in 
Port-au-Prince suggested that Aristide exploited Clinton's statement to 
pressure the United States to act more strongly against the military leaders 
who ousted him in September, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Cautious against the possibility that the immigration crisis could resume, 
Shrager said in an interview Monday that the reason for its stark pause might 
be attributable in part to high seas and even the Haitian preoccupation with 
soccer's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also insisted that the major factor appears to be that "the message 
seems to be getting out -- if you take a boat (out of Haiti), you won't get to 
the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 The President, in Miami to promote his health care reform proposal, pointedly 
did not address the Haitian crisis, even though South Florida, which already 
has the nation's largest Haitian population, is preoccupied with the prospect 
of more Haitians fleeing there from their country, the Hemisphere's poorest. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have assailed the President for what they term his meandering policy 
on Haiti and Haitian refugees. After suggesting that Haitian refugees would get 
speedy processing for possible U.S. immigration, the Administration declared 
July 8 that the United States would no longer accept them, but would instead 
send the fleeing Haitians to havens in other countries until their nation's 
political crisis was resolved or they returned home. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, about 451 Haitian refugees opted for repatriation rather than stay 
at the only existing haven for them: the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Shrager said that an average of 30% to 40% of the 14,000 or so Haitians 
stopped by the Coast Guard this month are asking to return to Haiti rather than 
live in a tent city. This shows, he said, that "most (Haitian refugees) want to 
go to the United States" and are not necessarily only seeking to escape 
political oppression and human rights violations at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline in refugees has been aided in part by radio broadcasts and other 
institutional communications advertising America's tougher new policy. But most 
experts think the major reduction can be attributed to the Haitians' internal 
oral and personal network. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the (refugees) themselves realized what was happening and started coming 
back, they told their townsmen that no one was getting to the States," said one 
U.S. official, "and that did it."

BOSNIA SERB LEADER WARNS ON DANGERS OF PEACE PLAN; BALKANS: THE MUSLIM-CROATIAN 
PARLIAMENT BACKS THE INTERNATIONAL PROPOSAL THAT WOULD SPLIT THE COUNTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As Bosnian Serb officials met Monday in their mountain stronghold of Pale to 
debate whether to accept an international peace plan to divide 
Bosnia-Herzegovina among the warring parties, their leader, Radovan Karadzic, 
warned that the take-it-or-else proposal could be disastrous for the whole 
Serbian nation. 
</P>
<P>
 In his opening address to the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb assembly, Karadzic 
denounced the peace plan, saying that "this was now or never for the whole 
Serbian nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, in Sarajevo, the rival Bosnian Parliament -- made up of Muslims and 
Croats -- endorsed the peace proposal, which would give them 51% of Bosnia, 
leaving Serbs with the rest. A separate, Muslim Parliament backed the plan 
earlier Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Bosnian Serbs, who in more than two years of war have captured more 
than 70% of Bosnia, have indicated they are unwilling to relinquish their 
military gains. Bosnian Serb forces, backed by the Yugoslav army, launched 
their war against Bosnian independence in April, 1992, declaring that they 
hoped to join with their Serbian kin in the Balkans to create a Greater Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we reject the plan, we must prepare ourselves to reject all attacks by our 
enemies, but also to move into enemy territory in the shortest possible time to 
completely and utterly defeat our foes," Karadzic told the Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that if they rebuff international peace efforts, "we are threatened 
with the continuation of the war in far more difficult circumstances for us in 
which Muslims would be better-armed. There will be a battle for life and death. 
We will have blood, sweat and tears and we will be alone in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the powerful nations that put forward the present plan -- dubbed the 
"last chance for peace" -- have told all the Bosnian warring parties they will 
face punitive international steps if they reject this latest effort to end the 
war, which has claimed about 200,000 lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations already has imposed some sanctions in the Balkans, 
especially against the rump Yugoslavia, now made up of the republics of Serbia 
and Montenegro. The United States, Russia, Germany, France and Britain have 
said the Bosnian Serbs would see even tougher measures if they rejected the 
latest peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muslim-led Bosnian government also would have been subject to further 
international steps had its president, Alija Izetbegovic, not recommended that 
his assembly back the plan -- "not because it is good or will end the war" but 
because it would give the Muslim-led government troops a better chance to "end 
the war successfully," he said. The lawmakers agreed, with only 17 of 160 
deputies in the Sarajevo Parliament rejecting the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization partners have 
indicated that if the Bosnian Serbs balk at the peace proposal, the West may be 
prepared to lift its weapons embargo on the Muslim-Croatian alliance and give 
it logistics support in its attempt to recapture Serb-held territory. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Karadzic, he reportedly was summoned here on the eve of his session 
with other Bosnian Serbs for a last-ditch effort by Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic to persuade his former proteges to endorse the peace plan. Milosevic 
wants to get international sanctions against the rump Yugoslavia lifted. But 
this will not happen as long as the Bosnian war drags on and his regime 
supports Karadzic. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a clear indication that the rift between Karadzic and his erstwhile 
mentor is widening, Bosnian Serb officials scorned the peace plan Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want more than we have now," said Dragan Milanovic, a Bosnian Serb 
official. "We want more (land) than we hold now. We cannot live like this. . . 
. The Muslims would hold too much under the plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Milan Ninkovic, another Bosnian Serb, said he and other officials might seek a 
referendum on the peace plan -- a delaying tactic Karadzic has been criticized 
for suggesting before in response to other peace plans. 
</P>
<P>
 But "if the world does not accept this (referendum), the Serbs are ready for a 
big war," Ninkovic said.

CIA REFORMS IN WAKE OF AMES CASE HERALDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Director of Central Intelligence R. James Woolsey launched a public campaign 
Monday to show that he is reforming the CIA and its "culture" from within in an 
effort to head off growing congressional pressure for more far-reaching change, 
in the wake of the Aldrich H. Ames spy case. 
</P>
<P>
 The CIA director announced a series of internal changes in the way the 
intelligence agency maintains security, evaluates its personnel and runs its 
computer system. In addition, Woolsey said, there will be internal reviews of 
the CIA's principal directorates of operations (espionage) and intelligence 
(analysis). 
</P>
<P>
 These changes were portrayed as the CIA's response to the Ames case. The 
30-year CIA employee pleaded guilty in April to spying for the Soviet Union. He 
has been sentenced to life imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Changing attitudes, norms and practices will take a great deal of effort and 
a lot of time," Woolsey said in a speech to the Center for Strategic and 
International Studies, a Washington think tank. "But we can and will take major 
steps to reduce the possibility of treachery in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Ames' guilty plea, Sens. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) and John W. Warner 
(R-Va.), the chairman and ranking minority member of the Senate Intelligence 
Committee, have been pushing for appointment of a presidential commission that 
would study the need for fundamental, potentially far-reaching changes in the 
CIA. Warner's role is significant because he is a conservative lawmaker who has 
generally supported the CIA against outside criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "These changes he's talking about appear to me to be minor," DeConcini said 
Monday. "We need new people, new ideas, new direction (at the CIA). Maybe this 
is where Woolsey's going, but it is at a snail's pace." 
</P>
<P>
 In Monday's speech, Woolsey sought to explain why his reaction to the spy case 
seemed so muted. "Some called for instant action," he declared. "But I wanted 
the certainty of a conviction. I was not about to say or do anything to 
jeopardize the case." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the CIA director unleashed his harshest denunciation to date 
of Ames, calling him a bigger traitor than Benedict Arnold, the notorious spy 
for Britain during the Revolutionary War. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our agents in the Cold War against the Soviet Union risked their lives, 
helped keep you free and died because this warped, murdering traitor wanted a 
bigger house and a Jaguar," Woolsey declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey acknowledged that the CIA made some mistakes in its handling of the 
spy case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Appropriate resources were not dedicated promptly in the Ames case, at at 
least one important juncture . . . ," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back in 1985, questions about Ames' suitability and performance were raised 
in the Latin American Division of the Directorate of Operations, then 
evaluating him for onward assignments beyond his tour in Mexico, but these 
questions and concerns were not shared outside it." He said reforms in CIA 
management will ensure that this does not happen again.

FEINSTEIN SEEKS 1-YEAR OUSTER FOR ARMED STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said Monday that she will seek passage of 
legislation to require nearly every public school in the United States to expel 
any student for a one-year period if he or she is caught carrying a gun in 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein, joining with Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.), said they would propose 
the "gun-free" school policy as an amendment to the $12-billion Elementary and 
Secondary Education Act when it comes to the Senate floor this week or next. 
</P>
<P>
 The provision is expected to be approved with little opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids are scared to death," Feinstein said at a news conference. "The schools 
are not safe, and the No. 1 fear is that kids will get shot on the way to 
school or in school." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed amendment would provide that any school district that receives 
federal funds would have to impose a one-year expulsion on any student who 
brings a gun to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what would happen to students during the year they are barred from 
classes, Feinstein replied: "If you bring a gun to school, you're probably not 
learning anything anyway. And the other students will feel safer." 
</P>
<P>
 She said Los Angeles schools adopted a mandatory expulsion policy for 
gun-toting students but without any specific time requirement. Feinstein said 
school violence in the district dropped by 14%.

CRITIC OF MEXICAN FOOD HAS TARGETED OTHER POPULAR DISHES

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Center for Science in the Public Interest, directed by Michael Jacobson, 
over the last two decades has delighted in telling consumers about the health 
risks of some of the nation's most popular foods, including buttered movie 
theater popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
 The center has analyzed and itemized ingredients, then shared the often 
surprising findings with consumers.Jacobson, 50, who holds a Ph.D. in 
microbiology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, founded the center 
with a partner in 1971 after working with consumer activist Ralph Nader. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobson's battles are shrewdly orchestrated: scathing but pointed studies, 
followed by aggressive media campaigns and, finally, behind-the-scenes, 
work-the-phones lobbying of officials. Besides some small private foundation 
grants, the center in Washington is funded largely by dues from 750,000 
subscribers to its Nutrition Action Health Letter.

BANK REGULATOR SAYS CLINTON SOUGHT AID; INQUIRY: COMPTROLLER OF CURRENCY TELLS 
WHITEWATER COUNSEL THAT THE PRESIDENT APPROACHED HIM AT NEW YEAR'S WEEKEND 
RETREAT. HE SAYS HE REBUFFED REQUEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton personally asked the top banking regulator at the Treasury 
Department last New Year's weekend to give him advice on how to handle the 
Whitewater controversy, Administration officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Comptroller of the Currency Eugene A. Ludwig has told Whitewater special 
counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. that he refused Clinton's request, made during the 
Renaissance Weekend conference at Hilton Head, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Ludwig said that Clinton asked him to meet and provide him with personal 
counsel on the growing Whitewater controversy. Ludwig, who is in charge of the 
government's regulation of nationally chartered commercial banks, believed it 
would be inappropriate for him to get involved in a case that involved 
allegations of misdeeds at a federally regulated financial institution. As 
comptroller of the currency, Ludwig is also a member of the board of the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which has been directly involved in key 
aspects of the Whitewater investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske is looking into allegations that then-Gov. Clinton may have benefited 
improperly from his association with James B. McDougal, owner of the failed 
Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan and partner with Clinton and his wife, Hillary 
Rodham Clinton, in Whitewater Development Corp., an Ozark real estate 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's request for help from Ludwig occurred before disclosure of other 
contacts between Treasury and White House officials over Whitewater sparked a 
controversy in Congress in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Those meetings, between key Treasury and White House staff members, became an 
early focus of Fiske's probe. Contacts between political appointees at the 
White House and Treasury raised questions about Administration handling of 
Whitewater, because the Treasury officials supervised the Resolution Trust 
Corp., the agency in charge of the federal investigation of Madison Guaranty. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first public report on his investigation, Fiske said that he could find 
no evidence of criminal wrongdoing related to any of the contacts between the 
White House and Treasury. Although he did not detail all of those contacts, 
Fiske knew about Clinton's meeting with Ludwig when he cleared the 
Administration of wrongdoing. White House officials said Monday that Fiske 
questioned Clinton about the conversation when he interviewed the President and 
First Lady in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting between the President and Ludwig, an old friend and fellow Rhodes 
scholar and Yale Law School graduate, has not been publicly disclosed before 
and now seems likely to be an issue at congressional hearings next week. A 
spokeswoman for Ludwig said that on Wednesday he will brief staff members from 
the House Banking Finance and Urban Affairs Committee and the Senate Banking, 
Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, which will conduct the hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Ludwig wrote a memo to Fiske on March 11 detailing his conversations with 
Clinton in response to a Fiske subpoena of the Treasury Department asking for 
information about all contacts between the Treasury and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Ludwig said that during a seminar at the annual Renaissance Weekend, an elite 
networking conference, the President asked him for his advice on Whitewater 
issues. Ludwig said that Clinton stressed that he did not believe he had done 
anything wrong but that he wanted Ludwig's help because of his expertise in 
banking laws, according to Lee Cross, a spokeswoman for Ludwig. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton asked Ludwig to meet with him further, Cross said. But while still 
attending the conference, Ludwig began to have qualms about getting involved as 
a personal adviser to the President on the issue. He called Treasury general 
counsel Jean Hanson, Deputy White House Counsel Joel Klein and Associate White 
House Counsel William Kennedy to ask their opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Ludwig was advised not to get involved and agreed not to work with the 
President on Whitewater. "Within 24 hours of their original conversation," 
Ludwig talked to Clinton in a corridor at the Renaissance Weekend and told him 
that he did not believe it would be appropriate to advise him, Cross said. 
Clinton told him that he understood. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Counsel Lloyd N. Cutler on Monday offered reporters a slightly 
different account of Clinton's conversation with Ludwig, however. He said that 
the President was not asking Ludwig to give advice on Whitewater but to 
"recommend people who understand real estate transactions and could write about 
them for the public in a way the public could understand."

SURGEON GENERAL'S SON CONVICTED OF SELLING COCAINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The 28-year-old son of Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was convicted Monday of 
selling $275 worth of cocaine to an undercover officer last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Prosecutor Chris Palmer said he will seek at least 10 years in prison 
for Kevin Elders at sentencing Aug. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 The offense is punishable by a term of up to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Circuit Judge John Plegge ruled in the non-jury trial that Elders had failed 
to prove entrapment. 
</P>
<P>
 Elders had claimed that an acquaintance who set up the drug deal had 
threatened to expose Elders' drug habit and embarrass his mother during her 
Senate confirmation hearings unless Elders obtained cocaine for him. 
</P>
<P>
 The surgeon general also testified briefly that she and her family had been 
subjected to open opposition when President Clinton nominated her for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Oliver, was also in Little Rock for the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Elders was convicted of selling one-eighth ounce of cocaine to the 
undercover officer and the acquaintance.

STUDY CRITICIZES MODEST HEALTH REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to turn up the heat on uncommitted lawmakers, President Clinton's 
allies on Capitol Hill released a study Monday indicating that middle-class 
people who have health insurance will pay higher premiums if Congress passes a 
health reform measure that falls short of guaranteeing universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 In framing universal coverage as a middle-class issue, they hope to take some 
of the momentum out of several incremental measures that are gaining favor in 
both houses of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) urged fellow members of 
Congress to "remind ourselves what it is that we are trying to achieve and who 
we are trying to benefit." 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to put all the pressure we can on wavering senators," added Sen. John 
D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.), one of the Clinton plan's most ardent 
supporters. He contended that the modest measure that many lawmakers view as an 
"easy step" would be "a fatal blow to their constituents who are working 
middle-class Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 The more modest approach, which is being touted in various forms by lawmakers 
of both parties, would encourage more competition among health providers and 
eliminate many widely criticized insurance industry practices, such as those 
that make it difficult for people with known illnesses to buy coverage. The 
various alternatives also would provide government subsidies to help those at 
or near the poverty line afford health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Such proposals would not meet Clinton's bottom-line goal of assuring that 
everyone has health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The study by the Virginia consulting firm Lewin-VHI Inc., was commissioned by 
the Catholic Health Assn. of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 It indicated that the incremental approach would be more expensive for insured 
families earning between $20,000 and $75,000 a year. The firm concluded that, 
absent a requirement that everyone buy coverage, new policy-holders would in 
general be sicker than the population as a whole, and, therefore, more 
expensive to cover. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, it concluded, a bill guaranteeing universal coverage would 
lower the health costs of middle-class people who now have health insurance, if 
it were combined with government-imposed cost constraint, such as that 
envisioned in the Clinton plan. 
</P>
<P>
 For a family earning between $30,000 and $40,000, for instance, health costs 
would rise about $344 in 1998 under the incremental approach; its spending 
would decline $165 in a system under which everyone was required to have 
coverage.

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY; DEFENSE MUDDYING IS MEDIA-SAVVY PLOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mud hit the fan in time for Monday's news and talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
 With one lightning strike, O.J. Simpson's team tried to spin their defense 
onto a new course with stories in the New Yorker and Newsweek that the accused 
killer was framed by a rogue police detective with a history of racism and a 
desire to be the hero of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 When I talk about mud, I don't mean to imply that the defense's tactics were 
dirty, although I was always taught that making an unsubstantiated allegation, 
such as Simpson being framed, isn't exactly clean. Rather, I chose the word for 
the impact that the charge will have. 
</P>
<P>
 The maneuver was like tossing a boulder into the unfathomable pool of public 
opinion. When the rock hits bottom, mud and sand rise, clouding the water. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I called a political consultant for advice because the latest maneuver in the 
Simpson media wars has little to do with the law. Rather, it's like the closing 
days of a dirty political campaign, complete with smears and leaks. My source 
was Arnie Steinberg, a respected pollster who has been a strategist for Mayor 
Richard Riordan and many other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg is better qualified than most to talk about spinning a criminal 
case. In 1986, he found himself being investigated by Los Angeles County Dist. 
Atty. Ira Reiner, who had filed charges against his client, Bobbi Fiedler, a 
San Fernando Valley congresswoman running for U.S. Senate, and her political 
aide, Paul Clarke. The investigation ended when a judge threw out the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiedler and Clarke had been indicted on charges of offering a $100,000 
campaign contribution to lure an opponent out of the race. As a Fiedler 
strategist, Steinberg was worried about the investigation, a concern heightened 
when he realized he was being tailed by the D.A.'s detectives. After charges 
against Fiedler and Clarke were dismissed, the tail was dropped, but memories 
of that experience remain with him. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is with the Simpson case, shaping public opinion was important in 
fighting the D.A.'s attack. So in talking to Steinberg, I was more or less 
getting the view from the inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Their strategy was to get the case, which was weak, dropped before the trial. 
Steinberg said his brother, defense attorney Herb Steinberg, advised him that 
"we have to create a media environment in which a judge, if he were to grant 
this motion (to dismiss), would not be attacked by the newspapers for letting a 
bunch of crooked politicians off." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my brother's feeling that the judge does watch television, does read 
the newspapers," Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Harland W. Braun, a pioneer in criminal defense news 
management, was brought into the defense team to provide a steady flow of tips, 
hints, analysis and leaks to reporters, whom he persistently cultivated. 
Media-sharp defense attorneys Roger Diamond and Howard Weitzman, who was 
Simpson's initial attorney, volunteered advice. The goal, Steinberg said, was 
to "provide a media environment" friendly to the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 A crucial event was a news conference at the Sportsman's Lodge in Studio City. 
The defense had gained access to 20 hours of conversations taped by D.A. 
investigators. These were supposed to really nail Fiedler and Clarke. 
</P>
<P>
 "We scheduled a daylong press conference," Steinberg said. "We played all the 
tapes, no holds barred. It was like a marathon thing." In the end, he said, the 
press went away bored and unimpressed with the D.A.'s evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg figures that with the money at the defense's disposal, the Simpson 
lawyers have done public opinion surveys to determine how the community is 
reacting. As is the case with a political campaign, the polling is probably 
helping shape strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 If that's true, then making sure the story appears in Newsweek and the New 
Yorker makes perfect sense, an elegantly timed ploy, coming out six days before 
Simpson appears in court, hot enough to make two national publications. By 
Monday morning, the talk shows had chimed in and this morning you're reading 
more details in this paper. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the impact? First of all, it influences the potential jurors, a subject 
I've written about before. It muddies the waters and may fuel the suspicions of 
minority jurors who already are skeptical of police. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense could be doing what the Fiedler-Clarke team did back in 1986, 
creating a friendly media environment. In this case, the goal would be to cast 
more doubt on the prosecution's evidence. Enough doubt, enough muddying of the 
water, and the press and public might not protest much if Dist. Atty. Gil 
Garcetti makes a plea bargain deal in the event the Simpson team decides to 
abandon its innocence defense. 
</P>
<P>
 A final word. Los Angeles Police Detective Mark Fuhrman's past was exposed to 
the public along with a theory -- no better than saloon speculation -- that he 
framed Simpson. He told Newsweek that his career is pretty well shot, and 
knowing the bureaucratic LAPD, he may be right.

FRENCHMAN SCALES 40 STORIES OF SKYSCRAPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Alain Robert, a tourist from France described by police as a frustrated 
mountain climber, was arrested after scaling 40 stories of a Chicago 
skyscraper. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert, 32, told police that he was bored with the traditional tourist 
attractions and decided to utilize his climbing skills Sunday to get a more 
interesting view of the city. Using only gloves and perseverance, he made his 
45 minute-climb using a window-washing track built into the side of the 
50-story structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert, who said he was from Valence, France, was released on a $100 bond 
after he was charged with trespassing.

TRIGLYCERIDES FOUND TO BE PERILOUS ON THEIR OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People who dramatically reduce their "bad" cholesterol still run the risk of 
heart disease from high levels of fatty acids known as triglycerides, USC 
researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
 High cholesterol has been identified as an artery-clogger and a major 
contributor to heart attacks. But the role of triglycerides has been a subject 
of intense debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Many doctors do not believe that high triglycerides are a danger in 
themselves; rather, they believe that triglycerides act in concert with other 
risk factors, such as high levels of "bad" or low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol and low levels of the "good" or high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
 In a study published in the July edition of the American Heart Assn. journal 
Circulation, a team led by Dr. Howard N. Hodis of USC found that when LDL 
cholesterol levels were aggressively lowered with the drug lovastatin, 
triglycerides continued to contribute to the growth of small to moderate-size 
blockages of vessels leading to the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 That finding was based on X-ray imaging that tracked the progression of these 
blockages, known as plaques or lesions. These blockages can lead to heart 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodis, director of the atherosclerosis research unit at the USC School of 
Medicine, concluded that cholesterol had masked the danger of triglycerides. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is difficult to demonstrate the importance of triglycerides until you take 
the LDL away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His study, funded by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, is the 
first to link triglycerides with the development of smaller lesions, which are 
considered more dangerous than larger lesions because they're more likely to 
rupture and block an artery. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 114 patients who took lovastatin, 112 had small and moderate-size lesions 
to begin with. To evaluate the role of triglycerides, Hodis and his team looked 
at levels of a protein associated with how the body metabolizes triglycerides. 
</P>
<P>
 They found that in the group with the highest levels of that protein, there 
was a fivefold greater risk of continued lesion growth. Of the 28 people with 
the highest levels of the protein, 82% had growth and 18% did not. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodis said the next step is to see if lowering triglyceride levels and 
controlling cholesterol with drugs further slows the progression of disease.

HUBER CLOTHES FOUND IN MURDER SUSPECT'S HOME; INVESTIGATION: COSTA MESA POLICE 
SAY SHE WORE BLACK MINISKIRT WHEN SHE VANISHED. EVIDENCE COULD LINK FAMALARO TO 
CRIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Building their case against murder suspect John Joseph Famalaro, Arizona and 
Costa Mesa authorities have recovered clothing believed worn by Denise Huber 
the night she vanished from Orange County three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The clothing, a black miniskirt and other articles, was discovered Monday in a 
box inside Famalaro's cluttered Prescott Country Club home. They were 
identified by Costa Mesa police and could be key evidence linking the suspect 
with the Newport Beach woman, whose nude body was found frozen in the back of a 
stolen rental truck parked in his driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa Police Lt. Ron Smith also said searchers recovered two Los Angeles 
County deputy sheriff uniform shirts. Famalaro once applied for jobs with both 
the Orange County Sheriff's Department and the Irvine Police Department, Smith 
said, but was turned down. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators in Orange County also interviewed employees of a San Clemente 
self-storage facility where Famalaro rented seven units from July, 1992 -- a 
year after Huber disappeared -- to February of this year. Famalaro contracted 
to have constant power supplied to the locker where he kept his personal 
belongings, including a freezer that may have been the one in which Huber's 
body was discovered last week, said Harry Tosado, facility manager of Allsize 
Self-Storage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole time the freezer was here, he wanted 24-hour electricity, which 
people here thought was very odd," Tosado said. "It's written right on the 
contract '24 hours.' " 
</P>
<P>
 When Famalaro moved the last of his belongings out of the facility in 
February, he asked the employees to help load the freezer onto his truck 
without delay. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he had a generator on his truck that would keep the freezer running 
while he was driving, but the main thing was, he wanted it loaded real quick," 
Tosado said. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery of the clothing and other personal effects, meanwhile, has led 
authorities to consider filing an additional charge of kidnaping against 
Famalaro, said Smith, which would elevate the murder charge to a capital crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy deserves the death penalty for what he did," said Smith, one of 
three Costa Mesa police officials assigned to the Arizona investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 There were these other developments Monday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Authorities are investigating the source of the chest freezer, and believe 
it may have been bought at a Montgomery Ward store in the Orange County area 
shortly after Huber's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fingerprints have been lifted from the freezer and officials are comparing 
them with Famalaro's. 
</P>
<P>
 * A Yavapai County Grand Jury will consider an indictment in the case as early 
as Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Famalaro's defense attorney, Lawrence W. Katz, said he is disturbed 
by the frenzied attention to his client and the assumption of guilt being made 
by many. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a total circumstance case," Katz said, adding that the stakes are 
especially high because his client could face the death penalty. "I'm not sure 
how you go from a frozen body in a freezer to murder." 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said hate calls have poured in from Orange County to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The calls) are stacking up," he said. "One woman called to say 'He should 
fry'. Another woman said only the death penalty would do." 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said he has yet to see any evidence linking Famalaro to the death. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no murder (case) here at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro, who is being held in lieu of $250,000 bond in Yavapai County Jail, 
is "depressed," said Katz. 
</P>
<P>
 In discussing the evidence accumulating in their investigation, Yavapai County 
Sheriff's spokeswoman Laurie Berra said there did not appear to be any effort 
to conceal the clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 New details about the condition of Huber's frozen body also emerged Monday. 
She was found face down inside the Signature brand, 23-cubic-foot freezer with 
her hands handcuffed behind her, said Yavapai County Sheriff G.C. Buck 
Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Huber appeared to have received about 10 to 12 blows and 
lacerations on the head and that these could have been made by a hammer or crow 
bar. As a result, several tools and other construction equipment have been 
seized from the home of Famalaro, who has been making his living as a house 
painter, contract handyman and real estate agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said there were no signs of sexual abuse, but the frozen condition of 
the body may prove helpful for medical examiners in their review of body 
fluids. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with all of the ongoing forensic investigations, Smith said that the 
circumstances of Huber's disappearance on June 3, 1991, might forever remain a 
mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might never know," Smith said, adding that it is still unclear whether 
Huber was taken by force or was somehow enticed to accompany her assailant. Her 
car was found abandoned with a flat tire on the Corona del Mar Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mystery to be solved now is: Who is Famalaro?" Smith said. "Denise was 
the mystery for three years, but he's the mystery now. He had the body frozen 
and kept moving it around. Bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
 The description seemed an apt one to the many law enforcement officials who 
converged on Famalaro's house Monday. Said Sheriff Buchanan: "I've been 
involved in some bizarre cases, but this has got to be one of the most 
bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, Costa Mesa and Arizona officials searched for other 
possible victims on Famalaro's hilltop property. Officials have called for an 
excavation team that will begin digging at three sites there. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second time in as many days, search dogs from Utah found three "areas 
of interest," two in the suspect's dirt-floor basement and another under a 
back-yard shed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what we will find in there," Berra said. "But we want to leave 
this house knowing that there is nothing left to be found." 
</P>
<P>
 Buchanan said the search will continue Tuesday and was partly prompted by the 
discovery of the names of 10 women during the search of Famalaro's home. 
</P>
<P>
 By late Monday afternoon, authorities had contacted five of the 10 -- some in 
Phoenix and Southern California. The remaining five were still being sought. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found the names, and we feel the need to check them out," Berra said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities also are concerned with the largely circumstantial nature of the 
case. It has led them to cart away file cabinets full of Famalaro's personal 
documents and possessions for further examination. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, all we have is a man in custody, a body found in a rental truck in 
his driveway and some of the victim's personal effects," Berra said. "That's 
not enough to prove guilt." 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to know where he's been and what he's been doing the past three 
years. We need to know much more about this man." 
</P>
<P>
 At the San Clemente self-storage company, Tosado said workers at the company 
searched their files Monday morning and found documentation showing that 
Famalaro corresponded with managers of the facility on several occasions over 
the past year from both Sedona and Prescott, Ariz. Tosado took over management 
of the facility about two weeks after Famalaro removed his belongings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another employee, Teresa Perez, 20, who was a manager of the facility when 
Famalaro was a customer, said she often saw the freezer unit, which did not 
appear to be locked and was not taped shut. 
</P>
<P>
 She described Famalaro as usually cordial but not overly friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes he came alone; sometimes he came with helpers. He'd say 'Hi, how 
you doing,' things like that," Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors, who are deciding whether Yavapai or Orange County officials will 
handle the case, have not indicated whether they will seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said he is not pleased that law enforcement officials have openly 
speculated that Famalaro's white, split-level home might contain the remains of 
additional victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think it's an overreaction," he said. "I believe in my client's 
innocence." 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney urged the public not to prejudge his client and said that 
Famalaro has not been accurately portrayed in recent news reports. Katz 
declined to elaborate on his client's background. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to documents filed with Justice Court in the nearby town of 
Mayer, where Famalaro was charged with murder and felony theft, the defendant 
characterized himself as nearly broke. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro lost his contracting license earlier this year after several clients 
complained about shoddy work. One employee filed suit, alleging that he was not 
properly paid. The suspect also indicated in court records that he would need 
help paying his attorney's fees since he earns only about $1,500 a month and 
still owes about $100,000 on his $160,000 home. 
</P>
<P>
 "My monthly expenses exceed my income. I am unable to meet all my 
obligations," Famalaro stated in court records. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect also told authorities that he helps support his parents and is 
their primary caretaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "If released, I would only do those things directly related to caring for (my 
parents)," he said in court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect's father, Angelo Famalaro, has Parkinson's disease, law 
enforcement officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Anne, remains active in local politics. She recently took up a 
petition in a successful fight to keep gambling out of the area. Neighbors near 
her Dewey home complained Monday of numerous confrontations with her over the 
years, including an incident when she hired a 24-hour guard to keep people from 
watching the progress of her home as it was being built. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Port Jefferson, N.Y., Famalaro told authorities that he is not married 
and drives a 1977 Dodge pickup. He has lived in Dewey for two years, moving 
there from Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Marion Thobe, the defendant's sister, said Monday the family is distraught 
over the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think anyone can imagine what type of crisis we are in right now," she 
said, adding that only time will separate the "truth from fiction" in this 
case.

CONTRADICTIONS MARK PROFILE OF FAMALARO 
</P>

<BYLINE>

 John Joseph Famalaro's mother was devoutly religious and a well-known 
political activist in Santa Ana who championed conservative causes. His older 
brother is a convicted felon who was once committed to a state mental hospital 
for sexually assaulting two patients when he was a chiropractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro's former neighbors in Lake Forest describe him as amiable and 
charming, waving regularly at them as he drove by. But when he moved out, he 
left behind an angry landlord concerned about property damage and a list of 
dissatisfied customers who had hired him to paint their homes or make repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 According to acquaintances, friends and law enforcement officials interviewed 
Monday, Famalaro's life, both as a child and as an adult, is filled with 
contradictions that may or may not help explain his alleged involvement in the 
murder of Denise A. Huber. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mystery to be solved now is: Who is Famalaro?" said Costa Mesa Police Lt. 
Ron Smith, who is investigating Huber's death. "Denise was the mystery for 
three years. But he's the mystery now. He had the body frozen and kept moving 
it around. Bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro, 37, is the prime suspect in the slaying of Huber, a young Newport 
Beach women whose disappearance three years ago sparked a frustrating 
nationwide search that finally ended last week with the grim discovery of her 
body in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Yavapai County sheriff's deputies found Huber's preserved body on Wednesday 
inside a deep freezer hidden in a Ryder truck parked at Famalaro's home in 
Dewey, Ariz. She was tucked in the fetal position and covered with plastic 
garbage bags. An electrical extension cord, they said, ran from a deep freezer 
in the 25-foot vehicle to the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber's body had apparently been frozen for as long as three years and moved 
from a storage yard in San Clemente to Arizona inside the Ryder truck. Crime 
experts say such behavior is consistent with murderers who like to keep 
mementos or the bodies of their victims as a trophy of their acts. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators in Arizona are only beginning to piece together the life of the 
man accused of murdering Huber, finding themselves confronted with a puzzle 
seemingly as complex as Huber's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say Famalaro was brought up on North Victoria Street in Santa Ana, an 
upper-middle-class area where his family moved in 1956 from Long Island, N.Y. 
The Famalaros were Roman Catholic, and John, as well as his brother Warren and 
sister Marion, eventually attended St. Joseph Elementary, a local parochial 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Acquaintances described his mother Anne as a "righteous, very opinionated" 
person, who harbored strong dislikes. One neighbor recalled that she once 
complained to the nuns, when St. Joseph Church, which ran the school, changed 
the catechism. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, neighbors said, her husband, Angelo, was exceptionally quiet and 
mild-mannered. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for Anne Famalaro's involvement in Santa Ana city politics, family 
members generally kept to themselves, and the Famalaro children were rarely 
allowed to play with other kids in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Standoffish," was the word people used to describe them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it was because they were new on the block," said Brodie Schmidt. "I 
don't remember them being involved in sports or school cliques or anything like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors said they were also struck by the Famalaros' decision to paint 
their stone and wood home pumpkin orange, which made it an eyesore on a block 
filled with custom homes and wide lawns. 
</P>
<P>
 While in Santa Ana, Anne Famalaro championed conservative causes, including 
the "fundamental schools" movement in the city. She ran unsuccessfully for City 
Council in 1981, and belonged to several groups including the now-defunct 
Republican Women's Club of Santa Ana, a Santa Ana beautification committee, and 
the Freedoms Foundation of Valley Forge, a nonpartisan group that promotes the 
nation's heritage through educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a very wonderful woman. . . . She did a lot of good community work," 
said Beverly Schick, who knew Anne Famalaro. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, tragedy struck the family when the eldest child, Warren J. Famalaro, 
an Orange County chiropractor, was convicted of sexually assaulting two of his 
patients, a 10-year-old boy and a 16-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 He was committed to Patton State Mental Hospital for 8 years, 8 months, and 
lost his chiropractor's license. He was transferred to an outpatient treatment 
facility in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Another neighbor, who requested anonymity, said Anne Famalaro sometimes 
stopped to talk with him when he was outside gardening in his front yard. He 
said that after her elder son was accused of child molesting, "she was 
devastated." 
</P>
<P>
 John Famalaro's upbringing may have been strict and sheltered, but probation 
reports from his brother's criminal case indicated that the Famalaro children 
did not have an unhappy childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 If the treatment his brother received is any indication, John did not want for 
much as a youngster. Warren was given swimming, speech, karate, piano and 
reading lessons and was provided a tutor "so he could excel at school and in 
private life," according to a pre-sentence investigation in court files. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter submitted before Warren's sentencing, his parents expressed pride 
in their son's accomplishments, described him as dedicated to his profession 
and said they had never observed any evidence of instability. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents can detect clues to the tendencies and behavior patterns of their 
children and we go on record to say that our son, Warren, had none that should 
have led him to be in the position he finds himself," Anne and Angelo Famalaro 
wrote of their son. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sentencing report also included a statement from Mary Willhoite, a 
former girlfriend of Warren Famalaro's, who said she felt his "attitude toward 
life was that people wanted to be taken and that women were generally stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 Willhoite said that Warren's mother Anne had tried to force the couple apart 
during their time together. She told authorities that the mother once 
threatened to kill her, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Famalaro family, who now live in Arizona, refused to comment 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 After attending Willard Junior High School in Santa Ana and high school, John 
Famalaro went to college but never graduated. Afterward, Costa Mesa police said 
he applied to became a law enforcement officer with the Irvine Police 
Department and sheriff's departments in Los Angeles and Orange counties but was 
never accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 He earned his living as a house painter and handyman, running his businesses 
from a home he rented until 1991 in the 22000 block of Perth Way in Lake 
Forest. His businesses were known as The Maintenance Doctor and Masterpiece 
Painting and Remodeling, but officials for the state contractors licensing 
board said they could find no license issued to Famalaro or his companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Michele Mary Levonius, who lives in the 22000 block of Perth Way in Lake 
Forest, said John Famalaro rented a neighboring home for about a year before 
moving out one evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "He left in the middle of the night, taking with him fixtures, wiring, 
faucets, cabinets -- anything that could help his independent handy-man and 
painting business," Levonius said. "He didn't take furniture -- just stuff he 
could use in his work." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County sheriff's deputies said they responded to a call from Anna 
Sabina, the owner of the property in 1991, after she accused Famalaro of 
allegedly damaging the property in an amount that "far exceeded his rental 
deposit." 
</P>
<P>
 But the vaguely worded complaint mentioned "nothing about anything being 
stolen," said Lt. Dan Martini, the department's spokesman, who noted that 
deputies dismissed the claim as a civil, not a criminal, matter and recommended 
that Sabina pursue the matter in court. Sabina could not be reached for comment 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Levonius said Famalaro performed odd jobs for residents throughout the 
subdivision of quaint suburban homes, most of which are trim, attractive, Cape 
Cod-style houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was really very personable," said Pat Darvas, who moved to Perth Way in 
1986. "He always waved. I saw him every day of my life during the year he lived 
here. He was always friendly. I did a lot of my own painting and trimming 
around the house, and he'd often say, 'Hey, nice job.' " 
</P>
<P>
 About 1 1/2 years ago, Famalaro moved to Arizona, purportedly to help care for 
his parents, especially his father, who police said suffers from Parkinson's 
disease. They live a few houses from each other in Dewey, about 15 miles east 
of Prescott. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors there said he was secretive and took pains to avoid them. Even his 
own mother, who lives across the street, said she knew very little about her 
son's adult life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really can't tell you much about him." Anne Famalaro told The Times on 
Sunday. "I think he is a good boy. I don't know what to make of all this." 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro continued working as a painter and handyman until Arizona authorities 
revoked his contractor's license in May following a series of complaints from 
customers about shoddy work dating back to June, 1993. In fact, it was a 
disgruntled customer, suspicious about the Ryder truck parked in Famalaro's 
driveway, who tipped off Phoenix police and triggered the discovery of Huber's 
frozen body. 
</P>
<P>
 Four customers whose damages totaled $11,290 reported to the Arizona Registrar 
of Contractors that Famalaro's company, Masterpiece Painting and Decorating, 
left jobs unfinished or performed tasks poorly and then refused to fix the 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 His license was canceled after he refused to respond to a complaint filed in 
December 1993 by Dorothy Scott of Camp Verde, who said he wouldn't repair her 
stucco as promised. Shortly after losing his Arizona license, Famalaro started 
work as a part-time real estate salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 At his home in Dewey, Famalaro lived like a pack rat, saving nearly everything 
from receipts to magazines. Though the house was in disarray, the periodicals 
were neatly stacked and his books were organized by subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro's neighbors described him as a night owl, who often worked into the 
early hours of the morning. The late-night work became such a nuisance, they 
said they had considered filing a lawsuit against him, but never pursued it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you'd talk to him and think this must be the nicest guy in the 
world," said Everett Martin, who lives two doors away from Famalaro's Arizona 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 But even his own brother conceded that there was a darker side to John 
Famalaro. A few months ago, when a Ryder franchise owner was trying to track 
down his missing truck, Warren Famalaro, the convicted felon, said his brother 
was "the black sheep of the family."

FAMALARO MAY BE PROSECUTED IN ARIZONA; COURTS: GENERALLY, TRIAL TAKES PLACE 
WHERE MURDER OCCURS -- BUT THAT MAY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After consulting with Orange County authorities during the day, the Yavapai 
County prosecutor indicated Monday that Arizona would probably take the lead in 
trying John Joseph Famalaro for the murder of Denise Huber. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, the trial would take place where the murder occurred, but in 
Huber's case that may be impossible to ascertain, Yavapai County Atty. Charles 
Hastings said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be very difficult to determine the time of death because of the 
condition of the corpse," said Hastings, referring to the fact that Huber's 
body has been frozen, possibly for a long period of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Maury Evans said prosecutors in both 
states are in close contact, but he declined to discuss where the case is 
likely to be tried. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to get into that type of speculation," he said. "We are 
reviewing the matter and hopefully in the very near future a decision will be 
made." 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Huber's mother, Ione Huber, said Monday the family is as yet 
unconcerned with that issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't had time to think about the trial," she said. "Once we get this 
(the funeral) behind us we'll be thinking more about the trial. . . . I'm sure 
we're going want to be there for part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ione Huber said she thought Arizona juries might be tougher on criminals than 
California juries. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that's true I would probably prefer that the trial be there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the family has "a lot of public support here and perhaps 
more public sympathy here and that might be in our favor. I don't know which 
way would be better," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference between prosecuting Famalaro in Arizona as opposed to Orange 
County may not be significant, legal authorities said. Hastings described the 
two justice systems as being "similar." Both states have the death penalty and 
employ it under "special" or "aggravated" circumstances, which could include 
multiple homicides, crimes against children or especially heinous situations. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, death penalty convictions in both states are reviewed by the same 
federal court, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. One difference, however, 
is that in Arizona, a judge determines whether a conviction warrants the death 
penalty, whereas in California, juries make that finding. 
</P>
<P>
 Hastings, however, said law enforcement officials "are far from making any 
determination on the death penalty. It's way too early." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Arizona officials are currently moving forward on the case, 
Hastings said Famalaro may be turned over to Orange County prosecutors if there 
is enough evidence to support a charge of kidnaping along with the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa Police Lt. Ron Smith said authorities are currently investigating 
and considering such a charge. 
</P>
<P>
 If authorities cannot determine where Huber was killed or it can be proven 
that she was kidnaped, legal experts said, Arizona officials will probably 
prosecute because her body was found in that state. The Newport Beach woman was 
23 when she was apparently abducted from an Orange County freeway in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Several legal experts said Monday the jurisdiction question may be complicated 
because of the issue of when and where Huber was killed. Even though the crime 
apparently began in Orange County, she may not have been killed in California. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, if the crime appears to have crossed state lines, federal 
authorities could get involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crossing a state line is always a way to raise federal interest in a case," 
said John Shepard Wiley Jr. a criminal law professor at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiley added that under a 1985 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Heath vs. 
Alabama, it is possible Famalaro could be prosecuted for the murder in both 
California and Arizona. But the likelihood of that happening is very slim, law 
experts agree. 
</P>
<P>
 While a preliminary hearing is set for Friday in Yavapai County, prosecutors 
also have convened a grand jury that is expected to consider indicting 
Famalaro, perhaps by Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hastings said the two prosecuting agencies are working together, and officials 
agree that Orange County law enforcement agencies will play a major role in 
Famalaro's prosecution wherever it occurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Public Defender Ron Y. Butler said his office is keeping "a very 
close watch on what is going on" and has been "communicating" with Famalaro's 
attorney, Larry W. Katz. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know who is going to retain jurisdiction," Butler said. "If it comes 
back this way we would want to be up to speed on it." 
</P>
<P>
 He said it is possible that Katz may not represent Famalaro if the case is 
transferred to Orange County. Documents filed in Yavapai County Justice Court 
indicate that Famalaro retained Katz, but has little money to pay him. He 
reported no savings and infrequent paydays. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa police, who have been involved in the case since Huber disappeared 
from a freeway in their city on June 3, 1991, agreed that they don't anticipate 
any jurisdictional dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where this case will be prosecuted is not a problem for us," Lt. Smith said.

DETECTIVE TRIES TO COME TO TERMS WITH 'CAREER CASE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON and KEN ELLINGWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Denise A. Huber's body was found Wednesday, few could blame Costa Mesa 
Police Lt. Ron Smith for his emotional reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past three years, the Huber case has been an almost constant companion 
for Smith and half a dozen other members of the Costa Mesa Police Department 
assigned to it officially -- and consumed by it privately. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell you one thing," Smith said, standing outside the home of murder 
suspect John Joseph Famalaro, "this thing, this case, has gnawed at me. We 
never actually gave up all hope." 
</P>
<P>
 No lead was too crazy to pass up, no investigative method too weird not to 
try. Investigators hypnotized possible witnesses, hauled in psychics -- even 
held their nose and went on tabloid television. 
</P>
<P>
 "You name it -- we tried it," Police Chief David L. Snowden said. "Everyone 
would say, 'That's crazy.' We tried it anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere did the name John Joseph Famalaro turn up as a possible suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was among the first detectives assigned to the case when Huber 
disappeared in June, 1991. He has followed hundreds of leads -- specks of 
information that have led him to obscure locations throughout California 
without results. 
</P>
<P>
 But last week, the trail of what Smith called his "career case" ended in the 
back of a rental truck, where Huber's body was found frozen. 
</P>
<P>
 Even at that point, Smith had one more duty to perform: a dreaded telephone 
call to Huber's family. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a surprise to them," Smith said. "It had been a long time between 
leads and good information. I think they feel that finally justice can be 
served. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've gone through a range of emotions. These are very good people," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Smith and others on the department have grown quite close to 
Huber's parents, Dennis and Ione. Snowden's friendship with Dennis Huber grew 
over two dozen breakfast meetings as the two chatted about the case over 
coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa police, unused to crimes of this magnitude and moved by the Huber 
family's unwavering faith, watched their professional detachment dissolve as 
the case wore on. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the mood at the Police Department was a mix of disbelief and the 
sense of a loved one lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you just got a call that a member of your family was found dead in a 
freezer, how would you feel? That's how members of the our department felt," 
Snowden said. "You just wish you could have done more." 
</P>
<P>
 Snowden has helped arrange a donated casket for Denise Huber and 
transportation for her burial in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very close to them, and I feel now they can put Denise to rest. They 
have suffered terribly," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing hundreds of miles from the Costa Mesa abduction site, Smith could not 
even estimate the hours and the money his department has devoted to their 
search for Huber. Snowden did not know either. No one ever added them up. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps a measure of those hours is the fact that during the marathon search, 
Smith was promoted from sergeant to lieutenant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably the most difficult time came on the day of the second anniversary of 
her disappearance," Smith said. "There were just a lot of loose ends to tie up 
and not a whole lot of information out there." 
</P>
<P>
 That was long after a monumental effort that began with a briefly promising 
canine search and continued with a nationwide media blitz that included 
thousands of bumper stickers and posters, even a sign bearing her likeness near 
the freeway. Friends and relatives had raised a $10,000 reward; "America's Most 
Wanted" and "Inside Edition" had publicized the case. Police treated the most 
remote leads with care. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as last month, one detective found new signs of hope in fresh 
leads that followed media coverage of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Smith and other authorities continued their search and vigil, the 
passage of time had simply become too much of an enemy against their hope of 
finding Huber alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The longer this went on," Smith said, "we had to come to grips that the worst 
had probably happened, and it did." 
</P>
<P>
 In the next few days, the 41-year-old lieutenant will begin a new chapter, one 
that he hopes will end in a conviction. Smith has joined a team of 
investigators from Yavapai County Sheriff's Department and other officials in a 
probe of Famalaro and his alleged connection with Huber. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be out here a while," Smith said.

VICTIM'S FAMILY 'HANGING ON' AMID OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Denise A. Huber's family said Monday that they have received tremendous 
emotional and moral support from people throughout Orange County in the days 
since her body was found in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have received a lot of calls," said Denise Huber's mother, Ione 
Huber."It's been amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 The recent discovery of their daughter's body and the subsequent media 
attention continues to take their toll on her and her husband, Dennis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really drained," she said. "We've been taking calls all day. We're doing 
OK and we're hanging on, but we've got a tough couple of weeks ahead of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Ione Huber said the family has been following media reports about the 
investigation in Arizona and are incensed by comments from murder suspect John 
Joseph Famalaro's attorney, who claimed his client is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you believe that?," she asked. "I think he's been watching too much O.J. 
(Simpson) stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 The family said they will have a memorial service for Denise Huber at 1 p.m. 
Saturday at Mariner's Church, 1000 Bison Ave., in Newport Beach. Those planning 
to attend can call (714) 640-6010 for information. 
</P>
<P>
 Another memorial service, followed by the funeral, is tentatively scheduled 
for July 28 in South Dakota. The funeral may be postponed if Yavapai County 
medical examiners don't release the body as scheduled, a family member said.
