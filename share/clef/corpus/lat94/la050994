 RUNNING ON EMPTY: For ironworkers like Fred Smith, rebuilding the 
quake-shattered interchange of the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways is 
a lucrative but exhausting task (B1). Smith routinely works "7-10s" -- 10-hour 
days, seven days a week. He is so tired, he says, that his eyes feel like they 
have cement lids. . . . On the other hand, freeway workers are grossing as much 
as $2,500 a week.

<P>
 HEALING OR HURTING?: She claims she can ease a baby's upset stomach with 
massage or bring back a wayward husband with prayer. She is a curandera -- a 
folk healer who uses a mix of herbs, mysticism and religion (B1). She doesn't 
want her name printed, though you can find her at home in Arleta. . . . But 
such unlicensed practitioners have come under scrutiny since a Reseda woman 
allegedly gave a fatal injection to a 22-year-old man. 
</P>
<P>
 CELEBRATING MOM: Sunday was Mother's Day, and Valley dads picked out bouquets 
while Valley moms savored fancy restaurant dinners (no dishes tonight, thank 
you). At the Strauss Ranch in Agoura, a band played Beatles tunes for a crowd 
of 30- and 40-something mothers and their families. Above, Sylvia Tillman 
twists and shouts with her daughter, 4. 
</P>
<P>
 SPUDS, SUDS AND ART: David Israel and his partners are about to open a new 
business in Northridge: a combination '50s-style diner and carwash. Besides 
their $1-million investment, they faced a $6,000 tax for a citywide arts 
program. But Israel persuaded officials to let him use the money to decorate 
his own business -- with a huge mural celebrating 1950s cruiser culture (B5). 
</P>
<P>
 ODD THANK YOU?: The Odd Ball Cabaret in North Hills, which features nude 
dancers, made news recently when city inspectors halted its "shower shows" 
because the stage had no wheelchair access. But some observers thought this an 
odd way to treat a business that, after all, had raised money for Rebuild L.A.

 STAR SEARCH: Environmentalist Mary Wiesbrock knows the power of a celebrity 
spokesman. As director of Save Open Space, she wants to sign up a movie or TV 
star to help stop the development of a mini-city on the Ahmanson Ranch in the 
Simi Hills (B5). . . . But so far, no takers. Dick Van Dyke is too busy. 
Heather Locklear, Sophia Loren and Frankie Avalon haven't responded to initial 
pleas. "I want to get a packet out to Robert Redford," Wiesbrock said. "But I 
just haven't had the time." 
</P>

 'BLACK BOY': Richard Wright's gripping autobiography about growing up poor and 
black in the segregated South continues to stir debate nearly half a century 
after it was published (B10). . . . Some parents in Fillmore insisted that 
their children get an alternate book to read in a high school honors class. 
Julie Wright explains the relevance of her father's insights into his unfocused 
rage as a boy: "Today, our children are no longer killing kittens, they are 
being given access to guns to kill themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 BLUESMAN HONORED: Local musicians and concert promoters hold a musical tribute 
tomorrow night for the late Buddy Smith, a veteran blues guitarist. . . . Smith 
developed a loyal following over his 30-year music career in the Ventura-Santa 
Barbara area. "He was one of the best guitarists in the country," said Michael 
Kaufer, founder of Ojai's Bowlful of Blues. "He influenced every blues musician 
in this area." The benefit concert begins at 7 p.m. at Nicholby's in Ventura. 
All proceeds, including the $5 cover, go to his family.

 LAST CHANCE: Voter registration figures continue to fall in Ventura County, 
and election officials warn that today is the last day to register to vote for 
the June 7 primary election. Republicans continue to lead Democrats by a mere 
4,690 registered voters, but neither party has mounted a significant campaign 
to sign up more voters, said elections chief Bruce Bradley. Registration cards, 
which are available at most government offices, must be postmarked today or 
dropped off at county offices by 5:30 p.m.

GEORGE RAMOS: WILL THIRD FIESTA WORK LIKE A CHARM?

 Thanks to "cholo punks," Armando Garza is a two-time loser when it comes to 
celebrating Cinco de Mayo. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in 1989, Garza, his wife and a dozen family members went to Lincoln Park 
to celebrate the holiday. About 30,000 showed up, and by all accounts, they had 
a great time, for a while. But gang members from all over the city showed up 
and eventually turned the fiesta into a pitched battle among themselves and 
then with police. One person was shot to death and several others were injured 
in the melee. 
</P>
<P>
 I interviewed Garza, an insurance salesman from Pico Rivera who grew up in 
Lincoln Heights, after the city decided it would no longer hold large-scale 
events at the park because of the problems that occurred that Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cholo punks," Garza told me back then, referring to the gang members, 
"ruined it for all of us. I hate them." 
</P>
<P>
 With last week's news of Latino gang members running amok at L.A. Fiesta 
Broadway, causing chagrined city officials to denounce the troublemakers and 
vow to stage the event again next year, I remembered Garza. 
</P>
<P>
 When I reached him by phone at home the other day, Garza said he, his wife, 
Irene, and three teen-age daughters had been at 4th and Spring streets where 
the trouble broke out. They were forced to flee when things got out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cholo punks did it again," he growled. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like a lot of us who grew up in the barrio, Armando Garza has lived with the 
reality of street gangs all his life. He knows some gang members by name, and 
considers them his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 These friends defend the cholo moniker much the same way an earlier generation 
of gang toughs had to deal with the term pachuco. Pachuco came into our 
vocabulary because it came to describe the zoot suits and the many young people 
who wore them before and during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 In L.A., pachuco took on a demeaning connotation because it referred to the 
few young Mexican Americans who dressed up in those suits and also got involved 
in several riots with soldiers and sailors on leave. What most forget, Garza 
likes to point out, is that the servicemen went out of their way to assault 
brown-skinned kids in their "unpatriotic" suits. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad got beat up and he did nothing wrong," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Times, however, have changed and so have the gangs. And so have Garza's 
feelings about them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lookit," he begins, "I can put up with the graffiti, the guys calling me ese 
. But it's now getting out of hand -- the drugs, the guns, the drive-by 
shootings. And now this, messing up celebrations like Cinco de Mayo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took my family to Lincoln Park in '89 and we had to take off because of the 
cholos who showed up. I was thinking that wouldn't happen at L.A. Fiesta 
Broadway because of all the good people involved and the heavy presence of 
police. But the same damned thing happened again." 
</P>
<P>
 He is enraged that Los Angeles' cultural celebrations are now threatened by 
the gangbangers. 
</P>
<P>
 There used to be a time when there were a lot of community-sponsored 
celebrations of both Cinco de Mayo and Mexican independence day in September. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Lincoln Park event was canceled shortly after the '89 trouble. Other 
than L.A. Fiesta Broadway, Central City's only official observance of Cinco de 
Mayo this year was at Olvera Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Garza and I agree that celebrations of Cinco de Mayo are overblown and 
misplaced because they have nothing to do with Mexico's independence from 
Spain. But while they inexplicably include rap music or heavy metal on 
occasion, these events do provide opportunities for Chicanos to revel in their 
Mexican traditions. In a town that's the third-largest Mexican city in the 
world, that's no small thing. 
</P>
<P>
 It's important to keep up those traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Garza hopes L.A. Fiesta Broadway comes back next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't give in to the punks," he says. "Tell the cholos we run the city, not 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I'm no law-and-order type, but I have to agree with Garza. Give in to the 
gangs and you might as well say adios to all public celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Word circulated in the aftermath of the recent trouble that some at City Hall 
even fear for the survival of the annual Christmas parade in Hollywood, too. 
The troublemakers, presumably gang members, are becoming a growing problem 
there and some city officials wonder if the Yuletide tradition can continue as 
it always has. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you imagine getting rid of that parade?" Garza asked. "I took my 
daughters to that parade. I remember going as a kid and waving my arms at the 
celebrities. L.A. won't be the same if we can't have those things." 
</P>
<P>
 And what about Cinco de Mayo next year? 
</P>
<P>
 "There better not be a third time," he says.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: COMMENT; OUT OF 
'BLIND ANGER, INSIGHT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIA WRIGHT, Author Richard Wright's gripping autobiography, Black Boy, 
about growing up poor and black in the South early in this century split a 
Ventura County high school honors class early last month into opposing groups. 
Some parents of the Fillmore High School students objected to what they said 
are amoral and violent messages in the book and insisted that their ninth- and 
10-grade children be given an alternate text. Below, we publish excerpts of a 
letter Wright's daughter wrote from Paris to the students and parents in 
response to the uproar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thank you for being so alive and sensitive to my father's book that, almost 60 
years after it was written, you are heatedly and passionately able to debate 
its perceived message. Your ability to throw yourselves into the controversy 
with such gut feelings says as much about the staying power of "Black Boy" as 
about the state of the society to which this story of childhood and youth has 
been transmitted through the years. 
</P>
<P>
 What strikes me -- as the author's daughter but also as a parent and former 
teacher -- is that some of us should choose to be morally horrified and 
sanctimoniously censorious of the desperate, isolated, bravado killing of a 
kitten by a hungry, illiterate "black boy" in the rural South early in our 
century. It strikes me that these attitudes exist today, when minorities are 
still trying to survive in underprivileged communities, where the temptation to 
own a gun, to deal and consume crack, to belong to an armed "gang" has 
solicited our youngest children. 
</P>
<P>
 There is one significant difference between today's apparently senseless 
boomeranging of our children's murderous violence against themselves and my 
father's deliberate autobiographical rendering of his own childish animal 
slaying: Today's violence goes largely unexplained and unredeemed, whereas 
Richard Wright lucidly used the kitten episode to communicate his childhood 
despair, his unrelieved physical hunger, his rebellion against a drunken father 
who could communicate better through the violence of beatings than through 
words. 
</P>
<P>
 The very act of writing honestly about the acting out of one's own murderous 
impulse toward a creature perceived as weaker than oneself replaces bravado 
with bravery, senselessness with a search for meaning, blind anger with 
insight. It is less the act than the account of the act that commands our 
fascination: The child-who-has-become-the-writer offers up this chilling and 
brutally realistic autobiographical episode as a symbol of the attitude adopted 
by oppressed youth toward those they perceive as more vulnerable than 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Children can identify with the kitten's weakness but try to hold that feeling 
at bay; hence their ambivalence toward a hapless, inarticulate act in which 
there lies an appeal to be rescued from helplessness and hopelessness. It was 
one thing to have killed a kitten once upon a time, and another thing to write 
maturely and acutely about one's own self-perception of this childish act. The 
kitten is a dark disturbing mirror held up to the child's own weakness, 
dependence, hunger, disobedience and inarticulateness -- all negative values 
that prevent survival in the racial jungle. "Cats can't talk," Wright wryly 
comments in his book "Native Son." If, unlike the kitten, the child had been 
able to find the words to say his rage he might not have killed. Instead, he 
would have cried out: "Daddy, I want to do to the kitten what you are doing to 
me. And what you are doing to me is being done to you by cruel giants out 
there." The writer that child grew up to be was finally able to say these 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Wright confesses against the grain. He writes with the sincerity of 
rebellion about the misery of a mutilated childhood -- choked like the kitten. 
He wanted the world to know that as a barefooted kid in the racial maze of the 
Deep South, he was an alcoholic even before he knew what the word meant because 
his mother worked in white folks' kitchens and he was left to roam a violent, 
segregated world without a meaningful compass. 
</P>
<P>
 An infant learns how to walk and talk -- it is his birthright. But learning 
the oppressor's language with one's mother's milk is a double-bind in itself. 
The child who was to grow up to be Richard Wright began very early to 
appropriate the forbidden, hidden meanings of language and the taboo immensity 
of space. In the first pages of "Black Boy," we see little Richard lifting the 
veils of hypocrisy from adult words.  
</P>
<P>
 In the same spirit of healthy exploration of an unhealthy environment, the 
child sets fire to the curtains that are placed between him and the world 
beyond his segregated cage: He needs to test the arbitrary bars of that cage 
and his growing, normal intellectual curiosity is abnormally inflamed by 
surrounding racial taboos, illiteracy and bigotry. Perhaps it was in the very 
killing of a kitten he was initially moved to protect and feed that the writer 
was born in the child. For the first time, the son was able to throw the ugly 
reality behind his father's brutal words in the face of his law-giver, in the 
face of the man who had ordered: "Kill that damn thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Today our children are no longer killing kittens, they are being given access 
to guns to kill themselves. I believe that the more educational space our 
children can be given to ponder and discuss the messages of writers who were 
able to X-ray their own violence, the less these children will act out their 
rage in kitten-like mindlessness.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: CONVERSATIONS WITH 
JACK KATZ AND ESTELA LOPEZ; THE FIESTA IS 'TOO PRECIOUS TO LOSE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Katz and Estela Lopez, Gang disturbances forced the early closure of 
the Fiesta Broadway on May 1, resulting in 18 injuries and 14 arrests. The 
incident raises the issue of whether such gatherings are viable. In separate 
interviews, free-lance writer Catherine Gewertz talked to Jack Katz, a UCLA 
sociology professor who studies deviant behavior and crime, and Estela Lopez, 
executive director of Miracle On Broadway Corp., the nonprofit firm that 
co-sponsored the fiesta. Here are their views: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: What were the main things that went wrong at the fiesta? 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez: Not in any order: On that day, Broadway attracted lots of young people 
affiliated with gangs. This has not happened before. Also this year, for the 
first time there was one stage (at 4th and Spring streets) where the 
entertainment was unfortunately the type of music attractive to those sectors 
of our community that are violence prone. Also the alcohol was available just 
outside the perimeter of the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Given the problems at fiesta and at other street festivals, do you think 
these sorts of events are no longer viable in Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez: Absolutely not. They are not a thing of the past. What has to become a 
thing of the past is the idea that we can't afford to do them because they are 
too great a risk. 
</P>
<P>
 The defining question for the city of Los Angeles is not whether there will be 
another Fiesta Broadway, but where are we going to draw the line and say to 
people who want to be disruptive, "No, you will not get away with that here." 
If we say we'll move it to a safer location, we're saying, "We are willing, 
gang members of Los Angeles, to give up Broadway to you, to give up Hollywood, 
to give up Venice Beach." I hope we're not prepared to do that. Because it 
cannot be that we have come to the point where the only folks who can count on 
enjoying a safe family outing are those who can afford tickets to the Hollywood 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What can be done to avoid trouble in the future? 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez: We need to find more ways to make it family-oriented. In the past, our 
formula worked. It was only one day, only during daylight hours. Our 
entertainment offered something for everyone. And there was no heavy metal or 
rap that can appeal to elements that might cause trouble. But we need to step 
back and take a look at changes that have occurred within society and make 
changes in what we do. 
</P>
<P>
 We are asking ourselves, do we charge admission, even nominally? And the 
question about gang members is hard. You can't exclude them based on what they 
wear.  
</P>
<P>
 I think that if it's done well, a festival like this can give Los Angeles its 
spirit back. That's something too precious for this city to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What creates problems or the potential for problems at large street 
festivals?  
</P>
<P>
 Katz: In the last 10 years in L.A. and elsewhere, public spaces that attract 
young people have become increasingly vulnerable to violent outbreaks. If you 
have young people congregating -- even non-gang people in relatively affluent 
areas -- you're likely to attract gang-identified kids and trouble may well 
break out. 
</P>
<P>
 Gang kids used to stay in their own neighborhoods, but that seems to have 
broken down. It may make for trouble at public events, but on longer view, it 
may be very positive for the development of group relations in American 
society. You have people feeling more comfortable moving into parts of town and 
having relations in public with people of other ethnicitiesand other income 
levels. That seems to me to be positive. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What changes have brought gang youth into the mainstream youth culture? 
</P>
<P>
 Katz: Mainstream culture has gone out to reach the gangs, not the other way 
around. Popular culture, movies, dress styles -- they celebrate and emulate 
what they present as gang or criminal styles. It's not that gang culture has 
changed so much. It's that popular culture is now drawing on those images and 
creating a mass market to present them. Gang kids, whose styles used to be kept 
out of the mainstream, now find they don't look so different. They can more 
comfortably go places where they would have stood out as oddballs.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: What changes might have to be made to continue staging events such as the 
Fiesta Broadway. Should we just stop having them? 
</P>
<P>
 Katz: I am sympathetic to those who say it would be extortion to give up a 
positive event because of the actions of a few. But if you're going to try to 
control these events, the only way to do that is to make them for older adults 
or put a price tag on them that keeps out poor kids.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Given our high-tech sensory-assault civilization -- with its graphic 
television, violent movies and explicit video games -- it may seem almost 
anachronistic to censor the written word. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, as one eloquent author so wisely noted many generations ago, words are 
"the gateway to a forbidden and enchanting land." And, there are always people 
afraid of what they will find beyond the gateway. 
</P>
<P>
 The author who wrote those words was Richard Wright, whose landmark "Black 
Boy" has repeatedly been targeted by the would-be censors in the almost 60 
years since it was first published. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, at Fillmore High School in Ventura County, some parents 
objected to a painful account of Wright killing a kitten to challenge his 
father. In today's Comment, the author's daughter -- Julia Wright -- addresses 
the concerns of her father's critics. 
</P>
<P>
 Censorship, of course, is not new. "There has always been an attempt to censor 
the ideas and information available going back to recorded history," says 
Judith Krug, director of the American Library Assn.'s Office of Intellectual 
Freedom in Chicago. "It has never abated." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Marina del Rey-based political action group People for the 
American Way documented 347 censorship attempts throughout the country for the 
1992-93 school year. California had the most, with 29. 
</P>
<P>
 "These incidents involve books, plays, productions, self-esteem programs, drug 
prevention programs, environmental curricula," says Jean Hesburg, California 
director for People for the American Way. "The censor succeeded 41% of the 
time," Hesburg says. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, of course, the defenders of censorship, who say they are not so 
much trying to limit what is available to the public as to ensure that what the 
public is reading reflects "family values." 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest book banners are the library community that chooses the books," 
says Beverly Sheldon, director of research for the Traditional Values 
Coalition. "They choose some books but not others. Everyone makes choices. We 
also have our criteria," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Mel Gabler of Educational Research Analysis Inc., in Longview, Tex., admits 
that his group, which scours textbooks for objectionable material, is often 
referred to as "the No. 1 censor in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 The group has, for example, criticized textbooks for making "promiscuous kids" 
role models, for not emphasizing that abstinence is the most effective way to 
prevent the spread of the AIDS virus and for not presenting the benefits of the 
free enterprise system. 
</P>
<P>
 "The books cover free enterprise but then they throw in all the things they 
find wrong with the free-market system," Gabler says. "Instead, they find all 
kinds of ways to bring in the benefits of government intervention when everyone 
knows how overloaded our bureaucracy is." 
</P>
<P>
 The fighting over school curricula is worrisome to some. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that there is a very vocal minority that is seeking to impose 
their beliefs on public school education," Hesburg says. "These groups are 
trying to change the face of public education."

 My neighborhood was dying. The mostly yuppie and elderly neighbors kept to 
themselves. They would leave for work in the morning, return in the evening and 
in between phone the gardener, the pool cleaner, the handyman. Occasionally, 
there would be an exchange of cautious smiles between people whose lives had 
overlapped for years and yet who had never spoken to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 I hear my dad talk about he way it used to be. The houses were full of kids 
who congregated regularly on our street, had lemon fights and races down the 
hill. It all sounded so fun and idealistic. But I had given up hope on that 
dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Then one morning six months ago, we saw the Altadena fire tear toward our 
isolated neighborhood. It crept closer as we waited for help that never 
arrived. We were on our own. We stopped worrying about ourselves as 
individuals. The walls separating us came down. 
</P>
<P>
 I woke up earlier than usual that Wednesday. The air was much warmer than 
normal and there was an eerie wind blowing across the mountain. I stumbled 
around half asleep. The phone rang and my grandma's voice urgently asked me 
what was going on. She was asking me? I was as clueless as she was. I was 
scared. Where was my family? I told my grandma that I would call her back. 
</P>
<P>
 I ran outside and smelled smoke. I was excited, the kind of excitement you 
feel the morning you leave on vacation. I knew this would not be an ordinary 
day. But I was not worried when I saw how far away the flames were. We could 
see the brilliant glow across the ridge, but the firefighters would easily be 
able to put it out.  
</P>
<P>
 My dad drove over to look from a different direction. My mom took a shower and 
dressed for work. I grabbed the camera and snapped the approaching flames. I 
noticed how fast they were coming and became alarmed. I didn't hear sirens; it 
was unearthly quiet. I ran to my room to decide what to take if we had to 
evacuate.  
</P>
<P>
 By the time my dad returned, the smoke was getting thick and we could feel the 
temperature rising. We turned on the hoses and began piling things into the 
van. We heard loud explosions; they were houses above us blowing up. I didn't 
hear any sirens. I didn't see any firefighters. Many of my neighbors came out 
and asked others if they needed help. 
</P>
<P>
 We had gathered up everything we could fit into the van, including all our 
animals. I put the fish into an empty peanut-butter jar. My family joined the 
parade of cars down the hill through the blinding smoke, many people not 
realizing they had just seen the last of their homes.  
</P>
<P>
 My family went to our church and spent the morning watching the news. We saw 
our street in an aerial view, and we saw our garage in a smoldering black spot. 
As I stared at its smoking remains, I realized all that we had lost and how 
lucky we were. We stored everything in there, since our closets are small. My 
mind walked through the garage and I saw our Christmas decorations and "Baby 
Doll," my first and favorite doll. There are no more pictures I drew of people 
without bodies, just arms and legs growing out of their heads. All the family 
heirlooms are gone.  
</P>
<P>
 There were tremendous losses. Of the 12 houses on my rural street, four were 
destroyed and none escaped damage. But our community was united and now we are 
standing together against the hordes of looky-loos and fast-buck contractors. 
The Times reported that "friendships were forged by fire" and I think that sums 
it up. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood is different now. The charred trees and destroyed houses are 
reminders of what we went through together. I am more hopeful that my dream of 
living here like my dad did can come true. We help each other out now. My 
neighborhood is rebuilding together: houses, lives, friendships.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TESTIMONY; ONE 
PERSON'S STORY ABOUT DOING BUSINESS ON SKID ROW; 'IT'S LIKE A THIRD WORLD 
COUNTRY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By As Told to ROBERT SCHEER; Tracy Lovejoy has been director of the Central 
City East Assn. for six years, representing manufacturing and industrial 
businesses in the eastern part of Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The area I represent is referred to as Skid Row. The business community 
doesn't like to call it that because it doesn't really help business, but 
that's what everyone else calls it. 
</P>
<P>
 It's like a Third World country. On the corner of 5th and Crocker streets at 
any time of the day you can find anywhere from 50 to 100 people milling about. 
Open trash bins have been turned into bonfires. People have created a sort of 
tent village. There are tents or cardboard homes leaning against the sides of 
the buildings. You have people walking by selling drugs. You have prostitutes 
trying to make money. There is a sense of unreality that you are in the 
downtown of the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet there are thriving businesses down there; you have the Flower Mart, 
the Produce Mart; almost all of the seafood that's distributed within the 
county of Los Angeles comes from this area. This is a neighborhood that creates 
more than $7 billion in gross income and employs more than 40,000 people. This 
isn't an area that I think the city wants to neglect. Look what happened to 
Detroit and other major cities that have neglected and ignored their downtown 
businesses: They've left and the downtown has turned into a ghost town. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet that might happen here. The homeless problem and everything associated 
with it -- the crime, the drugs -- makes it nearly impossible to do business. 
You can't really bring clients into the neighborhood. You have to pay your 
employees hazard pay. Even trying to get people down for an interview -- they 
don't even want to stop and get out of their car! And you have to have your 
employees, especially female employees, escorted to their cars.  
</P>
<P>
 You watch people day in and day out defecating on your doorstep, urinating on 
your doorstep, just walking around, obviously deranged, yelling at you from 
across the street, maybe waving something -- maybe it's nothing more than their 
hand, but it's intimidating. 
</P>
<P>
 And the majority of people that work in the seafood industry are women. They 
come in at two, three in the morning, usually on the bus, and have to walk to 
their facility when it's still dark out. 
</P>
<P>
 One of our board members was recently hit over the head -- I think he got 12 
stitches -- by a homeless individual wielding some kind of bat. It's very 
difficult to justify asking employees to come in day in and day out and deal 
with all this. 
</P>
<P>
 We've had business people come up to someone sitting on their property and ask 
them to move along and the homeless people on the sidewalk have said: "Well, 
we're going to burn down your building tonight." The rights of the few are 
taking over the needs of the many. We have to start looking at what the 
community and the city as a whole need to do to better themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 It's gotten to the point where these businesses are looking very seriously at 
other cities. Cities like the City of Commerce or the City of Industry are 
providing a huge incentive for people to leave. S. E. Rycoff (a restaurant 
supplier) is a perfect example -- they moved to Orange County and took about 
1,000 employees and $2 million to $3 million a year in tax money with them. 
</P>
<P>
 And the way the city and county have dealt with this has been unfair. We have 
been the homeless dumping ground for the entire city of Los Angeles and the 
county as well. There's no other Skid Row in the county, except for homeless in 
Santa Monica.  
</P>
<P>
 We believe the city's homeless problem has been dumped on it by the bigger 
businesses in the western part of downtown. The large white-collar businesses 
there needed the homeless cleaned out, so the politicians and the bureaucrats 
dealt with it by moving the problems east. You're not going to starve in Skid 
Row. You can eat three or four free meals a day there. The city and the county 
have concentrated all of their services -- whether it be alcohol rehab, drug 
rehab, low-income housing -- in a five- or 10-block area. Most of the $300 
million that this region has spent on the homeless in recent years has gone 
into this one compact area, encouraging the homeless to be centralized. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the homeless problem and its solutions need to be decentralized. We 
need to reintroduce these people back to "normal society" because Skid Row is 
not a neighborhood in which people recuperate; they stay there. 
</P>
<P>
 With Mayor (Richard Riordan) speaking about the importance of business and 
(President) Clinton talking about the need for industrial manufacturing jobs, 
they should wake up to the fact that this is one of the city's biggest 
industrial areas -- if not the biggest -- and they should be finding ways to 
reinvigorate the neighborhood. It doesn't need a lot, it just needs to be 
treated like the rest of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the business community is always perceived as being heartless 
and uncaring on this issue. But we're the ones who have to deal with this every 
day. And after years of this you ask, "Why is this occurring?" My tax dollars 
should be solving this problem. 
</P>
<P>
 It should not be OK that people are living on sidewalks. It shouldn't be OK to 
the county reps, it shouldn't be OK to the City Council. It's not OK.  
</P>
<P>
 In Downtown L.A., four blocks away from City Hall, six blocks away from the 
County Hall of Supervisors you have a Skid Row that is worse than a Third World 
country. And that's not OK for the United States of America.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: LANDING ON MY FEET; 
HIGH-TECH WORKER MAKES RIGHT TURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BALL, Compiled for The Times by Rip Rense; 18-year computer-industry 
veteran, age 40; became a salesman for Honda of Oxnard after being laid off 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I love automobiles and restoring cars. I couldn't find anything in my other 
industry, so on a whim, I presented my resume to (Honda of Oxnard). 
</P>
<P>
 They told me, "We don't understand anything about your resume, but you were 
successful in the field you were in." They decided to have me take the two 
weeks of intensive training and see how I turned out. Before my training was 
up, they were shorthanded and sent me out on the lot to deal with the 
customers, and four hours later, I sold them a car. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the things that made me reluctant to even try for this profession was 
the stigma that car salesmen had. They're somewhere in the social pecking order 
below lawyers and pond scum. In any case, I found these people to be creative 
and sensitive. A couple were irritating beyond belief, and it never ceased to 
amaze me that they were successful. But by and large I find them really 
pleasant, intelligent company. We've got a former film editor, a former 
programmer, a former college professor. 
</P>
<P>
 The job has its ups and downs, its challenges. A couple of customers have 
actually written me letters telling me how happy they are with their cars, and 
that just really pleased me. But times are a little rough right now. The public 
is looking at transportation in a whole different way. They are becoming far 
more practical, not at all frivolous.  
</P>
<P>
 What I do like about it is that every situation is completely different. The 
one constant in the automobile business is change. It's kind of like the 
weather in the Midwest: If you don't like it, wait five minutes, and it will 
change completely.

 Triple taxation? Tax on corporate profits.Tax on shareholder distributions and 
gains. And now a proposal for taxation on original stock investments (which in 
many cases are after-tax individual earnings). Wall Street tea party anyone?

A LIFESAVING INCONVENIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The death of a 7-year-old who was struck by a pickup truck passing a stopped 
school bus in Orange County has raised serious questions about safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Lanni, who was killed, had just moved to California.For unknown 
reasons, he exited the bus one stop before the one where his mother awaited him 
on his first day riding the bus, and then crossed the street. The Orange County 
Sheriff's Department said the driver of the pickup truck apparently was obeying 
the speed limit and no charges have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
 This case focuses attention on a flaw in state law governing when school buses 
must use flashing lights. The California Motor Vehicle Code requires their use 
if children will cross the street; when the lights flash, traffic must stop in 
both directions. But if children are not required to cross to reach their 
homes, the code actually bars use of the lights and traffic can pass a stopped 
school bus in either direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The Capistrano Unified School District said neither it nor the bus driver knew 
that any child crossed the street at the stop in Laguna Niguel. But the 
effectiveness of lights on school buses shouldn't be left to the whims of 
schoolchildren. That section of the code should be changed to require the use 
of flashing lights whenever children board or exit a school bus. The current 
law presumes children will not cross, and relies too much on effective prior 
communication. A change will inconvenience other motorists, but there is no 
comparison between an extra minute or two stopped in traffic, and the life of a 
child.

NATIONAL PARK SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proper response must be made to Michael McCalley's charge that the National 
Park Service is a "Gestapo-like organization" (letter, May 2). I have never 
encountered or observed a park ranger treating visitors without professional 
respect and helpfulness, in any of my visits to over 40 national park units in 
the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 I have seen park visitors bring their own problems to a park and deliberately 
break clearly posted park rules, commit damage to the environment, or bring 
harm to property or others. The well-trained law enforcement park staff handle 
these situations with more tact and professional courtesy than most urban 
police officers. In my experience, all federal agencies with the dual 
responsibility for the protection of natural resources and public recreation do 
a fine job.

MONTANA WILDERNESS BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alexander Cockburn's attack (Column Left, April 19) on the Sierra Club and 
other environmental organizations for their support for the pending Montana 
wilderness bill grotesquely and deliberately misrepresents the destiny of 
national forests in Montana. The Montana wilderness bill actually protects 
about 2.1 million acres, not 1.7 million, and retains the protection of an 
additional 700,000. Cockburn omitted areas protected as wilderness study areas. 
These areas include such threatened areas as the Thompson-Seton, Nevada 
Mountain, the Crazies, Cowboy's Heaven, Trout Creek, the Sapphires, Badger-Two 
Medicine, Choteau Mountain, Volcano Reef, Deep Creek, Renshaw Mountain and 
Falls Creek. Much of the Rocky Mountain Front has been saved from oil and gas 
drilling. 
</P>
<P>
 It does leave unprotected another 3 million acres in Montana, and is far from 
adequate. For that reason the Sierra Club is also supporting the Northern 
Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act (NREPA), which would protect these remaining 
areas, and additional millions of acres in Wyoming, Idaho and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 But the acres left unprotected by the Williams bill are already unprotected, 
and, alas, hundreds of thousands of acres of roadless area have already been 
lost in the last decade. Logging is not the only threat; oil and gas leasing is 
a major threat to grizzly bear habitat in some of the areas disparaged by 
Cockburn as "rock and ice."  
</P>
<P>
 That is why the Sierra Club has chosen to protect 2.1 million acres now by 
supporting the Montana wilderness bill, with as many improvements as we can 
squeeze out of this Congress. We oppose the so-called "release" language 
contained in the Montana bill, although as indicated these lands have already 
been released under existing law. We are beginning our campaign for the passage 
of NREPA and the protection of this entire ecosystem. We will be working to 
reduce logging budgets, reduce below-cost timber sales, and use whatever levers 
we can to protect this region.

MOUNTAIN LION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The recent killing of the woman by the mountain lion in Northern California is 
no less tragic knowing it is the first such attack this century. We are all 
aware of the risks we may encounter when visiting wilderness areas.However, the 
swift decision by the Department of Fish and Game "bounty hunters" to enforce 
the death penalty against this cat and its subsequent shooting (May 2) only 
reinforces my opinion of this department's frequent "kill it" solution to any 
wildlife resource issue that presents itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad that all the serial killers, rapists, and other human garbage sitting 
on death row at taxpayers' huge expense aren't dealt with in a similar manner. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Let me see if I understand the logic of the Department of Fish and Game. If we 
choose to live in or on a border of a wilderness area and a wild animal wanders 
into a neighborhood and attacks a human, the suspected animal is tracked down 
and killed. However, if a human deliberately goes into a wild habitat and is 
attacked, the suspected animal is tracked down and killed. Do I have that 
right? 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like a "lose-lose" situation for wildlife.

HISTORIC VOTE IN SOUTH AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I was 11, I remember standing on a beach in Cape Town, South Africa, with 
my toes in the white sand, a bucket of starfish and shells in one hand, looking 
out across the ice-cold caps of the Atlantic Ocean at a place that my father, 
who held my other hand, pointed to. "See that island out there," he said, 
looking out at a vague piece of land on the horizon, "that's Robben Island, 
where Nelson Mandela is. He's a black political prisoner and will probably 
spend the rest of his life there. He's a very brave man." 
</P>
<P>
 I thought of Nelson Mandela as I shoveled sand into my bucket. I built a sand 
prison with a moat and a turret and I marked an X with a stick in the sand in 
the place where he might be. I imagined him shoveling gravel, covered with 
sweat in the heat of the African summer, while an Afrikaans armed guard stood 
watch over him. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, I stood on La Cienega Boulevard with my father and other South 
African expatriates, both black and white. I held the hand of my 5-year-old 
American daughter and told her that I was there to vote for a very brave man 
named Nelson Mandela who was far away across the Atlantic Ocean. My vision of 
him was no longer vague across a misty horizon, but was clearly in front of me 
on the historic ballot sheet that had been handed to me inside the South 
African Consulate. On it was a picture of Mandela's smiling face, and in the 
assigned space, I marked, not with a stick in sand, but with a pen, an X for 
him.

 This could be entitled reflections on South Africa:

<P>
 "Whenever in a given community, at a crucial given point, great, heroic and 
superhuman actions must be accomplished in order for more fairness and justice 
to be created; then from within that community a spark is produced, which 
synthesizes in its personal equation the full conscience of the entire 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 The name of Nelson Mandela immediately comes to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 After a very long, overdue pregnancy, a free democratic South Africa is 
finally born. A bloodless revolution, as it were. This qualification, however, 
would deny any credits to the ultraconservative white right-wingers and 
regrettably to Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, who will be remembered in 
history for his open and fierce opposition to the operations and movements that 
turn this dream -- his dream as well as that of the Zulu tribes he rules -- 
into sheer reality.

 Nelson Mandela became the first person of color to be elected president in the 
new South African democratic government. Much congratulations are in order, and 
my hat is off to President Frederik W. de Klerk for having the courage, 
character and wisdom to recognize change, and allow it to take place. We here 
in the United States have been a democracy for some 218 years, and have yet to 
come close to electing a person of color to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Wake up, America! Change is here; as in South Africa, basic demographics will 
dictate who the future leaders of this country will be. I hope our future 
leaders in power recognize this trend and have the grace, courage and brains to 
allow it to happen.

 I was pleased to see you headlining the Opinion section (May 1) with a column 
on South Africa by Walter Russell Mead. The spirit of his piece is commendable. 
The election in South Africa is "a statement about human dignity" which should 
be admired by all. Unfortunately, Mead's history of the country is flawed in 
several places. Churchill's services as "a dashing British cavalry officer" was 
in the battle of Omdurman in the Sudan, not during the Anglo-Boer War, in which 
he served as a heroic newspaper correspondent. The Zulu King Shaka did not 
"mount one of history's great military campaigns against the whites." Shaka 
died before it began. "The last Napoleonic heir to the French imperial throne" 
did not die "serving in a British force that was massacred by Zulu warriors," 
but rather during a skirmish subsequent to the battle of Isandhlwana to which 
Mead alludes. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most distressing to me is the fact that Mead, a foreign policy 
specialist, failed to address the misguided U.S. foreign policy which sustained 
the apartheid system and prolonged the suffering of Mandela and his people. 
Readers deserve an accurate article on South Africa which asks us to confront 
the U.S. role in opposing sanctions, promoting Buthelezi, and otherwise 
thwarting the expression of human dignity we have just witnessed.

WHY TAKE CHANCES?; A JUDGE, CONCERNED FOR RIVER, ORDERS THAT RADIOACTIVE DUMP 
BE RECONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Would the Colorado River be contaminated by a low-level radioactive waste dump 
proposed for Ward Valley, a site in the Mojave Desert near the river? 
California's Department of Health Services says no. A study by three geologists 
with the U.S. Geological Survey says yes. Last Wednesday Los Angeles Superior 
Court Judge Robert O'Brien wisely said maybe and properly directed the 
department to reconsider its decision to approve the dump. The Colorado River 
provides a substantial percentage of Southern California's drinking water. Why 
take chances? 
</P>
<P>
 Geologists Howard Wilshire (whose name has now been given to the report), 
David Miller and Keith Howard identified five pathways by which radioactivity 
could migrate from the dump to the river in an initially little noticed 1993 
study. 
</P>
<P>
 The Interior Department (of which the Geological Survey is part) actively 
dissociated itself from their opinion and discouraged them from discussing it, 
especially with the press. But their courage, backed by the timely and forceful 
intervention of Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and meticulous report-reading on 
the part of the Committee to Bridge the Gap -- which spotted a passing allusion 
to the study and took the time to inquire about it -- have now clearly served 
California public safety well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is (the Colorado) threatened to be contaminated? Is it possible it will be 
contaminated?" Judge O'Brien asked. Answering his own question, he said, "It 
does not appear that the (USGS) analysis . . . has been placed in a proper 
perspective, so that an objective person can properly evaluate it. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 As for what is now required: "Due to the extraordinary importance of what is 
at stake here, e.g., radioactive waste and drinking water . . . the analysis of 
the Wilshire Report should be placed side by side, in its complete form, with 
the counter-analysis before any approval." 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt has already directed the National 
Academy of Sciences to review the Wilshire Report and publish its own findings 
by the end of 1994. Because assessment of the threat to the river involves an 
accurate characterization of the waste "stream" (the material going to the 
dump) as well as of pathways from the dump to the river, this review and the 
one the Department of Health Services is now on notice to conduct may begin to 
bring into the open matters of public concern that have by no means had the 
formal public airing they deserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Radioactive waste disposal is a clear need in California, but safe water is an 
even clearer one, not just for nuclear power, the biotech industry and 
radioactive medicine -- the key categories of waste producers -- but for the 
entire economy and the entire population. 
</P>
<P>
 As Judge O'Brien rightly said in his opinion, "Any doubt must be resolved in 
the form of caution."

ENDING PAIN SHOULDN'T MEAN ENDING LIVES; SUICIDE: COURT DECISIONS REFLECT 
POPULAR FEARS, NOT NECESSARILY TRUE, ABOUT SUFFERING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

chairman of the U.S. Catholic Bishops' Committee for Pro-Life Activities.

<P>
 Two court decisions -- a jury verdict in Michigan and a constitutional ruling 
by a federal judge in Washington state -- have raised the stakes in our 
national debate on euthanasia. 
</P>
<P>
 A Michigan jury's acquittal of Jack Kevorkian last Monday was shocking to many 
of us who believe in the rule of law. The state had a clear statute against 
assisting a suicide and the defendant openly confessed his involvement. But 
Kevorkian and his attorney wove a web of confusion around this simple case. 
Jurors ultimately said they weren't sure in what county the death took place or 
whether Kevorkian intended to cause death. All they knew was that he tried to 
end the victim's suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Barbara Rothstein's decision on Tuesday that Washington state's law 
against assisted suicide is unconstitutional displayed even more confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge compared physician-assisted suicide to abortion and to the refusal 
of life-sustaining treatment, arguing that it should have equally strong legal 
protection. Oddly, she then proceeded to claim that "assisted suicide" 
decisions could be tightly regulated to apply only to competent, terminally ill 
adults who voluntarily choose to kill themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 This made no sense in light of the legal precedents she chose. Ever since it 
was made a constitutional "right" in 1973, abortion has existed without 
meaningful qualification. And the right to refuse treatment, wherever it is 
treated as a constitutional right, also extends far beyond "terminally ill" 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
 In both areas of law, mentally incompetent patients routinely have their 
rights exercised for them by others -- even if they themselves never expressed 
any preference in the matter. Courts, guardians and families frequently use 
"substituted judgment" to make treatment decisions for unconscious patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The same happens with abortion. In Rothstein's own state of Washington, just a 
few months ago, a court ordered a second-trimester abortion for a mentally 
retarded woman, arguing that "the normal woman under these circumstances would 
have an abortion." Will we have long to wait before judges decide when it is 
"normal" to have euthanasia and to act accordingly? 
</P>
<P>
 These decisions have little to do with personal freedom and much to do with a 
certain way of thinking about human life. In both cases, everyone claimed to be 
trying to prevent suffering. Rothstein even said that the state has no 
legitimate interest in preventing suicide by terminally ill patients because 
"preventing suicide simply means prolonging a dying person's suffering." 
</P>
<P>
 The attitude that suffering has no possible value or meaning -- and more, that 
human lives that include suffering have no value or meaning -- is popular in 
our comfort-loving, pain-free society. In some areas of life, we appreciate the 
need to accept and overcome hardships -- "no pain, no gain," say our fitness 
gurus. But when it comes to dying, we are afraid of pain, of being dependent on 
others and of losing our dignity. 
</P>
<P>
 Those fears have been aggravated by some of the excesses of modern 
high-technology medicine. But it need not be so. No one should imagine that our 
only alternative to legalized euthanasia is pain-wracked and horrible death, 
though that is what the euthanasia movement wants us to believe. 
</P>
<P>
 The kind of care exemplified in the hospice movement is a compelling answer to 
the slogans of euthanasia advocates. This care does not involve unduly 
prolonging life for people with terminal illnesses. But through effective pain 
control, nursing care and simple human compassion, it helps people to live with 
dignity for as long as they are with us. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to say that we can be guaranteed a death without suffering -- just 
as no one is guaranteed a life without suffering. But suffering can be kept in 
human bounds. It can be faced with dignity and courage, and it need not be 
faced alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Christians, in particular, believe that loving acceptance of suffering can 
lead to enormous personal growth. We agree with the psychologists who have 
called the dying process the final stage of human growth. But we also believe 
in acting to relieve needless suffering. The Good Samaritan, who instinctively 
responded with healing and comfort when he saw a neighbor in need, is a model 
for all of us. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, a radically different and destructive response to suffering will 
become the norm in our confused society. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Dr. Joanne Lynn, a specialist on care for the aging: "It is an outrage 
for us to seriously discuss killing the sufferer rather than relieving the 
suffering." That outrage must be fought. 
</P>
<P>
 People who affirm life and love from within their suffering are doing the most 
important work on Earth. Their lives and their struggles are filled with far 
more meaning than the petty day-to-day activities that we call "productive" 
work. It's about time we said so, before our most meaningful citizens are 
shuffled off into Jack Kevorkian's van.

PROTECT GUATEMALANS LIVING IN THE U.S.; HUMAN RIGHTS: THESE REFUGEES DESERVE 
THE SAME PROTECTED STATUS GIVEN TO THOSE FROM OTHER WAR-TORN NATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RIGOBERTA MENCHU TUM, Rigoberta Menchu Tum, whose brother, father and mother 
were murdered by the Guatemalan army, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Juana is a Kanjobal indigenous woman from the Guatemalan highlands. Her life 
is a testament to the pain suffered by the Guatemalan Mayans, of the tortured 
cadavers, the razed towns and the disappearances. After a number of her 
relatives were assassinated and she received threats, Juana fled her native 
land. 
</P>
<P>
 Juana currently resides in the United States. She lives in constant fear of 
deportation -- which for her could mean death. Often she feels desperate to 
return to her country, but the violent situation in Guatemala restrains her. 
</P>
<P>
 Because human rights are not guaranteed in my country, hundreds of thousands 
of Guatemalans like Juana have abandoned the land they love, fleeing to 
countries such as Belize, Mexico and the United States. In the United States, 
about 100,000 Guatemalans live clandestinely, in miserable conditions, without 
legal status. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, in the name of my Guatemalan brothers and sisters, I met with Atty. 
Gen. Janet Reno, requesting that she grant temporary protected status to 
Guatemalans living in the United States. This would grant Guatemalans the right 
to live and work in the United States legally for a brief period, without fear 
of being deported. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Congress granted temporary protected status to Salvadorans. 
Presidents Bush and Clinton have extended it to Bosnians, Liberians, Libyans, 
Kuwaitis and Somalians. Guatemalans living in the United States need a similar 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
 I have been gravely disillusioned that the recent change in the Guatemalan 
executive branch has not in any way resulted in improved human-rights 
conditions. Last May, then-President Jorge Serrano Elias attempted to dissolve 
the Congress and the Supreme Court and suspend parts of the constitution. His 
acts demonstrated the fragility of the rule of law in my country.  
</P>
<P>
 In restoring legal order in Guatemala, the former human rights ombudsman, 
Ramiro de Leon Carpio, was named president. His ascendancy to the presidency 
generated great expectations that individual and collective rights within the 
nation would be respected. However, his administration has not lived up to our 
hopes; human-rights violations in Guatemala have increased rather than 
subsided. 
</P>
<P>
 This past winter, after discussing his intent to reform Guatemala's democratic 
institutions, President De Leon asked President Clinton to grant temporary 
protected status to Guatemalans. He stated that a mass return of Guatemalans 
would undermine his efforts to establish peace and stabilize the country. At 
the same time, he considered the money sent by Guatemalan refugees in the 
United States to their relatives an aid to the stability and the economy of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, in spite of requests by me and President De Leon, Atty. Gen. Reno 
recently informed me that the United States is not prepared to grant temporary 
protected status at this time. 
</P>
<P>
 I trust that, with the support of our international friends, including the 
United States, Guatemala's recently signed human-rights agreement will be 
enforced. Meantime, exiled Guatemalans could be granted a protective remedy 
according them the right to work and live freely in the United States without 
the risk of being deported. 
</P>
<P>
 Those of us who live far from our beloved homeland, like Juana and myself, 
anxiously await our future return, once the conditions for safety and respect 
for human rights truly exist.

BAD OLD WAYS BESET NATIONAL HEALTH-CARE PROPOSALS; REFORM: FORCING INSURERS TO 
CONTRACT WITH CERTAIN MEDICAL FACILITIES UNDERMINES BOTH COST CONTAINMENT AND 
QUALITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAIN C. ENTHOVEN and SARA J. SINGER, Alain C. Enthoven is a professor of 
public and private management at Stanford University's Graduate School of 
Business. Sara J. Singer, a health-policy analyst, is his special assistant. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A prominent feature of health-care reform proposals now in Congress would 
forbid the kind of efficient, economical and medically effective balancing of 
resources that have been developed by the best-organized health-care delivery 
systems in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Health-maintenance orgnaizations and other forms of preferred-provider 
organizations contract selectively with doctors and hospitals on the basis of 
quality and cost and arrange health services for their enrollees. They match 
their resources closely to the estimated health needs of the populations they 
serve. Through effective management, they make efficient use of hospital beds 
and of their generalist and specialist doctors. This sort of market-based 
efficiency, in which California is a pioneer, is what we should be striving 
toward nationally. But the national reform proposals would force health plans 
to contract with and include in their networks certain types of hospitals and 
health providers, even if this is not the most economical or highest-quality 
care available. 
</P>
<P>
 These proposals are rooted in the old "any-willing-provider" laws that forbade 
health plans to restrict services to certain doctors and hospitals if other 
doctors and hospitals would accept the same payment and service terms. The 
restrictions were overturned by California in 1982 and by many other states 
since. 
</P>
<P>
 About 120 million people have chosen to enroll in HMOs and PPOs for reasons of 
cost, access and quality, and millions more will do so if they are given the 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 The new variations of any-willing-provider laws are limited but equally 
damaging. For instance, the Administration's reform proposal requires health 
plans to contract with academic medical centers for specialty care. To ensure 
quality, health plans should be required only to meet appropriate quality 
standards; they should not be required to enter a contract with a certain type 
of provider on the erroneous assumption that it's the only way to provide 
high-quality care. To the extent that academic medical centers provide 
high-quality, high-technology and highly complex care, health plans should and 
do selectively seek their services. But not all academic-affiliated medical 
care falls into this category, and non-academic centers can also provide 
high-quality care. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's proposal, as well as the proposal recently adopted by the 
health subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee, also requires health 
plans to contract with a broad range of "essential community providers," for 
example Medicare-dependent hospitals, county health departments, rural health 
clinics and individual doctors serving medically underserved areas. The goal is 
a good one -- ensuring that services are accessible to all sectors. But health 
plans should not be restricted to certain providers if they can otherwise 
accomplish access goals. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble with these laws is that they destroy the bargaining power of 
purchasers of health-care services. Why should any academic center or essential 
community provider offer a good deal -- not to mention the lowest possible 
price -- to a health plan, knowing the plan must include them? Academic centers 
do provide medical education and research and essential community providers do 
provide local safety nets; both deserve support in these roles, but that 
shouldn't be done through mandatory inclusion in health plans.  
</P>
<P>
 Each of these proposals eliminates a health plan's ability to offer high 
volume to doctors and hospitals in exchange for lower prices because it cannot 
guarantee volume. Required contracting would increase administrative costs, 
reduce the ability of health plans to plan for appropriate staffing and 
facilities, increase duplication of high-cost diagnostic testing and create a 
labyrinth of disconnected, uncoordinated health care, which would lead to 
poorer quality and higher overall costs for health plans and enrollees.  
</P>
<P>
 Quality of care is another issue. It depends on the ability of health plans to 
select high-quality professionals and to review the appropriateness of the care 
provided. Any-willing-provider laws remove a health plan's ability to pick and 
choose among doctors and hospitals. What if, in the health plan's judgment, a 
clinic does a poor job, but it's not a matter that can be proved in court? That 
health plan must contract with that provider, even though the health plan will 
be held accountable for quality.  
</P>
<P>
 Even if an any-willing-provider requirement includes some quality standards, 
it would be impossible to adequately monitor large numbers of widely scattered 
doctors and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 These proposals, backed by doctors and hospitals, among others, would move the 
health-care industry back in time instead of toward a healthier future.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; A LIFESAVING INCONVENIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The death of a 7-year-old boy who was struck by a pickup truck passing a 
stopped school bus in Orange County has raised serious safety questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, Thomas Lanni, had just moved to California and it was his first 
day riding the bus.For unknown reasons, he exited the bus one stop before the 
one where his mother awaited him in Laguna Niguel and he then attempted to 
cross the street. The Orange County Sheriff's Department said the driver of the 
truck appears to have been obeying the speed limit. No charges have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
 This case focuses attention on a flaw in state law governing when school buses 
must use flashing lights. The California Motor Vehicle Code requires their use 
if children will cross the street; when the lights flash, traffic must stop in 
both directions. But if children are not required to cross to reach their 
homes, the code actually bars use of the lights and traffic can pass a stopped 
school bus in either direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The Capistrano Unified School District said neither it nor the bus driver knew 
that any child planned to cross the street at the stop. But the use of flashing 
lights on school buses shouldn't be left to the whims of schoolchildren. That 
section of the code should be changed to require flashing lights whenever 
children board or exit a school bus. The current law relies too much on 
communication between youngsters and drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 A change would inconvenience some motorists, but stopping in traffic for an 
extra minute is a small price for saving a child's life.

GIANTS' NINTH NO SYMPHONY FOR DODGERS; BASEBALL: SAN FRANCISCO GETS A WALK AND 
TWO SINGLES TO TURN A 4-3 DEFICIT INTO 5-4 VICTORY AT CANDLESTICK PARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The series had been much too calm for these two teams, but all that changed on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 On a cool evening at Candlestick Park, the San Francisco Giants' tempers flew, 
along with two home runs by the Dodgers. But in the end, a vow made last 
October by Matt Williams carried the most weight. 
</P>
<P>
 With Manager Dusty Baker, who was ejected during the seventh inning, watching 
the game from the clubhouse, Williams' grounder to left in the bottom of the 
ninth scored the winning run in the Giants' 5-4 comeback victory over the 
Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was (Former Giant General Manager) Al Rosen on the phone," Baker said 
after the game. "He said when I retire, I can come down and live in his house." 
</P>
<P>
 While Darren Dreifort (0-2), who gave up both Giant runs in the ninth, walked 
back to the Dodger dugout, the Giants spilled out onto the field in 
celebration. Williams, whose softly hit ball followed two other dinky singles 
and a lead-off walk, said it was the most emotional victory this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't rank them, but I guess it is," Williams said. "Everybody was hitting 
me on the head when the ball went through." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' vow, since retracted, was directed at Orel Hershiser, whom he 
believed had criticized him incessantly throughout the Dodgers 12-1 rout in the 
final game of last season, which knocked the Giants out of the division race. 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser started Sunday's game, but he wasn't there at the end. After 
slightly jamming his hip sliding into second base in an angry seventh, 
Hershiser left the game after giving up a leadoff homer to Todd Benzinger, 
which got the Giants within one run, in the bottom of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tough to lose a game when we were ahead in the ninth," Hershiser said, 
"and to lose it in the manner we did. The hits that scored the runs were on 
balls that weren't hit well, and we thought we made a lot of good pitches." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Dodgers, the loss meant a wasted opportunity to tie the Giants for 
first place in the division. It put them back in the same place they were when 
the series begin, in third place, two games behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the team is saying, 'Oh no, we didn't get to first place in 
this series,' " Hershiser said. "I don't think that is on the team's mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Butler's mind is occupied with thoughts about his left thumb, which was 
hit by a pitch in the seventh inning and could be bruised or broken. He was 
scheduled to have X-rays after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 That incident had Baker going jaw-to-jaw with plate umpire Joe West, who threw 
Baker and catcher Kirt Manwaring out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser had led off the inning with a single to right, and stolen second 
base after he got hung up off first. That's when he jammed his hip. Butler 
followed with a bunt attempt, but when he squared, the pitch hit his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 West said reliever Steve Frey's pitch hit Butler as Butler was pulling back, 
and he was awarded first base. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker was furious, and, even after he got ejected, went on to speak his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of questionable calls and I thought it hit the bat and an 
argument ensued," said Baker, who wasn't angry any longer. "After he threw me 
out, I thought I might as well tell him what I thought." 
</P>
<P>
 During the fifth inning, Baker argued after West ruled that Darren Lewis had 
put the wood on the bat before the ball came back to hit him on a bunt attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 This series had been much too gentlemanly for these two teams anyway, 
especially considering last season's finale. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants took a 2-0 lead in the third with five hits off Hershiser, 
including a one-run single by Barry Bonds, who was two for four in his first 
game since being sidelined with a bruised elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers tied the score in the fourth with a two-run homer by Henry 
Rodriguez, his fourth of the season. They went ahead in the sixth on a two-run 
shot by Wallach, who always hits well on Mother's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past four seasons, he has batted .474 with two doubles, three home runs 
and 12 runs batted in on Mother's Day. On May 13, 1990, he knocked in a 
career-high eight runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of Sunday's homers came off Salomon Torres, who was relieved by Frey in 
the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams had plenty of opportunities to score, with each team stranding 10 
baserunners. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bottom of the seventh, Jim Gott inherited a bases-loaded jam with one 
out, and pitched out, getting Williams to fly out and Bonds to pop out. But it 
was the ninth inning that decided this game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dreifort kept the ball on the ground," Manager Tom Lasorda said. "That's what 
he needs to do and he did it. He can't help it if they find holes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a tough one to lose."

NEW YORK'S RALLY WINS REVENGE OF THE KNICKS I 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ice storms. Howard Stern's gubernatorial campaign. Now the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing is easy here, not even the long-awaited revenge on the team that had 
eliminated the Knicks the last three seasons. With Michael Jordan off somewhere 
in double-A, the Chicago Bulls still led by 15 points in Sunday's third 
quarter. What was next? Would they put Jordan's No. 23 on a dummy, tie it to a 
horse like El Cid and put the Knicks to flight? 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to use the excuse of not having enough time, but we weren't in 
it," said Coach Pat Riley, after his Knicks rallied to beat Chicago, 90-86, in 
the opener of the Eastern Conference semifinal series. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to (be), but we just were not in it. They basically took it to us, 
so we can go to school on this game and feel thankful that our mothers were 
praying for us today because that's what it took." 
</P>
<P>
 After eliminating the New Jersey Nets, the Knicks had only a day to prepare 
for the Bulls' constant-motion offense. That was three fewer days than the 
Bulls, who had swept the Cleveland Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
 New York was coming off a week of playing bumper cars with a big New Jersey 
team, but Sunday, the Knicks couldn't jostle what they couldn't catch. 
</P>
<P>
 They also had their customary trouble shooting. When their lone dependable 
gun, Patrick Ewing, stumbled off to a two-for-six start, they found themselves 
down, 52-42 by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 If they suspected they were in trouble, they found out for sure in the third 
quarter, during which the Bulls increased their lead to 67-52. 
</P>
<P>
 Something -- the crowd? the urgency? Scottie Pippen on the bench? -- turned it 
around late in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fear of losing," said John Starks. "Fear of losing makes people do what they 
don't want to. We stepped up our effort, big-time." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last 1:30 of the quarter, with Pippen resting and Toni Kukoc trying to 
run the show, the Knicks cut five points off Chicago's lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive stands in the fourth quarter produced stops on five consecutive 
Bullpossessions and an 8-0 Knick run. With 5:49 to play, Anthony Mason's free 
throws tied it, 79-79. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 86-86 when Pippen, trying to run a pick-and-roll with Luc Longley, 
found both Knick defenders jumping him, abandoning the Bulls' center. Pinned 
down, Pippen fired a wild 30-footer to beat the 24-second clock. With no Bull 
retreating on defense, the Knicks hit Mason at the other end behind everyone 
for the basket that put them ahead to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley suspended Mason for the last three games of the regular season for 
complaining about playing time, so Mason must have been on top of the world 
Sunday night, right? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've pretty much put that suspension stuff behind me," said Mason, looking 
less than jubilant. "This was the biggest contribution I've made. I don't know 
if this was the best I've felt." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls gulped hard on the result. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to be (angry) to some degree," said Pippen, "but there's always 
tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be a much tougher opponent than what everybody anticipated. I 
think, reading things, hearing different things, people maybe think (the Knicks 
are) going to dominate the whole series. You know, whether the Bulls win a game 
in the series or not, it's not going to be an easy series for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Having survived a letdown, the Knicks are considering coming ready for Game 2, 
an approach they expect to hear more about. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not entitled to anything," said Riley, warming to his favorite subject. 
"I read in the press about sweeping this team. They're wearing three rings and 
they're not going to give 'em up. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some reason, people think we're entitled to move on and win the 
championship because we paid our dues and got beat three times in a row by 
them. They don't grandfather anything to anybody."

IT'S PARTY TIME FOR FINLEY, 7-0; BASEBALL: IT'S CHAMPAGNE AND PIZZA TIME FOR 
THE ANGELS AS PITCHER BREAKS OUT OF HIS SLUMP BY BEATING THE ATHLETICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A celebration awaited Chuck Finley when he walked into the clubhouse after the 
Angels' 7-0 victory over the Oakland Athletics on Sunday at Anaheim Stadium. 
There was champagne on ice, hot pizza, happy teammates and congratulatory 
handshakes. 
</P>
<P>
 So what was the big deal about a victory over the sad sack A's? 
</P>
<P>
 Finley won his first game this season, and that was cause for a much-delayed 
celebration as far as the Angels were concerned. They hope Finley has conquered 
whatever threw him into the funk that caused him to go winless in his first six 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be nice to get to bed before 2 o'clock in the morning," said 
Finley, who ended the Angels' 31-game streak without a complete game by 
throwing a three-hit shutout. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been staring at the ceiling all season. I kind of miss the days when 
you'd wake up and the TV would be on and all you'd see was snow. Now, there's 
all these infomercials on until 5, 6 in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
 He appreciated the sentiment, but was a little miffed that Bo Jackson didn't 
spring for more expensive champagne. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming from Bo, I thought it would be a $100 bottle, but that stuff was 
$4.20," joked Finley, 1-3 with a 5.55 earned-run average.  
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it was going to come," he said of his first victory of the season and 
only the fourth of his career against Oakland. "I just wanted to go out and 
throw well. If I won, I won. If I didn't, I didn't. All I was concerned about 
was throwing the way I knew I could." 
</P>
<P>
 In his last start, a 6-5 loss to the New York Yankees Tuesday, he had showed 
marked improvement, but still he was behind, 6-0, after giving up nine hits, 
including two home runs in six innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw last time out that his delivery was starting to come around," Manager 
Buck Rodgers said. "He wasn't really pitching bad, but he was making bad 
pitches." 
</P>
<P>
 Finley's victory Sunday, aided by run-scoring singles from Tim Salmon and RBIs 
by four other Angels, capped an 11-game home stand that was equal parts 
bizarre, disappointing and pleasing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels went 4-7, lost rookie starter Brian Anderson (3-1) for a month 
because of a broken left thumb and won three of four against Oakland to become 
the first American League West team to reach the 13-victory mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon, batting .253 when the home stand began, raised his average to .273 on 
Sunday. He went seven for 15 with two home runs and four RBIs in four games 
against Oakland. Salmon's run-scoring singles in each of the first two innings 
gave Finley a 4-0 lead and eased the left-hander's burden. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of clubs out there that have problems to solve," Rodgers 
said. "We're just starting to solve some of ours." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the A's (9-22) played a central part in Finley's turnaround. They 
floundered at the plate, particularly late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley gave up a first-inning double to former Angel Stan Javier, a 
fourth-inning single to Geronimo Berroa and a sixth-inning single to Rickey 
Henderson. Then, Finley retired the final 11 batters. He had seven strikeouts 
and, for the first time this season, did not walk a batter. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the Finley we've seen before," Oakland Manager Tony La Russa said. "I 
thought he was really tough today. Finley deserves a lot of credit. It was 
excellent pitching." 
</P>
<P>
 And what of the A's? They are 2-17 in their past 19 games yet dropped only 
three games in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
 Go figure. Rodgers has been trying, but he can't seem to get a handle on the 
woeful AL West. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wonder what the hell is going on," he said. "Thank God for realignment 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, with one victory each from Finley and Mark Langston, are only a 
game out of first place. 
</P>
<P>
 That, too, was worth a party as they headed off Sunday evening on a six-game 
trip to Texas and Seattle.

BIRDIE ON FINAL HOLE BRINGS CLEAN VICTORY TO SOBER DALY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The victory was special, and not just because it was his first in two years or 
because it brought him $216,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first tournament I've won on the PGA Tour in a sober manner," 
John Daly said Sunday after sinking a five-foot birdie putt on the final hole 
to win the $1.2 million BellSouth Classic at Atlanta by a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still shaking," he said. "Thank God it's over." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly finished with a par 72 in winning for the third time on the tour. Sharing 
second were defending champion Nolan Henke and Brian Henninger, who made an 
eight-foot eagle putt on the last hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly, the 1991 PGA Champion, hadn't won since the 1992 B.C. Open. He returned 
to the PGA Tour in March after a three-month suspension for his conduct during 
a tournament in Hawaii and a stay in a treatment center for alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great win, knowing I worked hard before I came back," Daly said, 
adding that he would celebrate by driving to his home in Memphis, munching 
donuts all the way. "I don't think two years ago I could have pulled that off. 
This is a great feeling to win again." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly led the last three rounds and finished with a four-round total of 
14-under-par 274 on the Atlanta Country Club course. 
</P>
<P>
 Needing at least a birdie to win on the par-five, 499-yard finishing hole, 
Daly, who had been using a two-iron off many of the tees on the tight, 
tree-lined course, hit a driver more than 300 yards down the fairway. His 
approach landed in a trap on the left of the green, and he blasted out to 
within five feet, sinking the putt after Henninger had made his eagle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked about 20 feet," Daly said of his final putt. "I can't remember 
winning a tournament where I had to birdie the last hole." 
</P>
<P>
 Henninger, who splits time between the Nike Tour and the PGA Tour, played the 
final two rounds with Daly and shot 71 Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Henke had a 69. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I had to make two birdies in the last three holes," Henke said. "I 
knew 18 was a par-four for John." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly came out strong with birdies on the first two holes, suggesting he might 
have an easy day. However, he ran into trouble on the fourth, beginning a 
string of three consecutive bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly got a stroke back with a birdie on No. 8, narrowly missing a six-foot 
eagle putt. He saved par on No. 9, then bogeyed No. 10. He also birdied the 
14th before falling out of the lead with the bogey on the par-three 16th when 
he three-putted from 40 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just kept plugging away," he said. "It was somewhat of an inconsistent day. 
The greatest thing about this day is I know I can still win a golf tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 Others learned, too. Daly's galleries were huge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like a football crowd," he said. "It was incredible. The last two 
days were unbelievable."

NBA ROUNDUP; THIS NO. 1-SEEDED TEAM ESCAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Atlanta Hawks advanced to the second round of the NBA playoffs for the 
first time since 1988, and they can thank Mookie Blaylock for that. 
</P>
<P>
 Blaylock finished with 18 assists, a season-high, and 13 points, eight 
rebounds and four steals in the Hawks' 102-91 victory over the Miami Heat 
Sunday at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks were the top-seeded team in the Eastern Conference, but they were 
pushed to a fifth and deciding game by the eighth-seeded Heat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks, down two games to one, evened the best-of-five series at 2-2 with a 
103-89 victory Thursday night at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 By winning Sunday, they avoided becoming the second No. 1 seeded team to lose 
to a No. 8. On Saturday, Seattle, top-seeded in the West, was ousted by No. 8 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Blaylock was getting most of the credit for preventing the same embarrassment 
for the Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a sensational game," teammate Kevin Willis said. "Defense, assists, he 
did it all. He was incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 Miami Coach Kevin Loughery went even farther. "Over the last two games, Mookie 
Blaylock was the most valuable player," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blaylock capped a late first-half surge that gave the Hawks a 54-44 lead with 
a desperation three-pointer with 2.4 seconds left, hitting from just over the 
half-court line. He had eight points, six rebounds and 11 assists in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawk Coach Lenny Wilkins said, "Mookie was terrific the entire game. He gave 
us tremendous leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 Willis scored a game-high 24 points for the Hawks, 15 in the second half. He 
also had 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami, making its second playoff appearance in its six-year history, was led 
by Grant Long with 22 points, 15 in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks, who last advanced to the second round before losing in seven games 
to the Boston Celtics six years ago, will play host to the Indiana Pacers on 
Tuesday night in the opener of a best-of-seven series. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 91, Houston 87 -- Kevin Johnson scored 11 of his 20 points in the 
fourth quarter and the Suns silenced the crowd in Houston with a two 
second-half spurts to win Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinal series. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to do some other things in the first three quarters -- defense and get 
some other people the ball," Johnson said. "In the fourth quarter, I had a lot 
of energy and I made a few shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix extended its winning streak to 11 games and won for the first time 
this season in The Summit. Game 2 is at The Summit on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns, down, 66-61, starting the fourth quarter, ran off 13 consecutive 
points for a 74-66 lead, their biggest of the game. The Rockets were scoreless 
over the first five minutes of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Barkley scored 21 points for Phoenix and Houston's Hakeem Olajuwon 
scored 36 points and got 16 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix made nine of 23 three-point shots and broke the playoff record of 20 
attempts, set several times. The Rockets and Suns combined for most three-point 
attempts (42), breaking the playoff mark of 34, set by Houston and the Lakers 
in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston built a 39-21 first-half lead but it was cut to 45-37 by halftime. The 
Suns used a 15-4 run at the start of the third quarter to get back in the game.

MORNING BRIEFING: PIPPEN MAKES A POINT FOR BULLS, BUT IT'S REALLY NOT THAT GOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Scottie Pippen of the Chicago Bulls was asked by Sport Magazine who would win 
if the Bulls played the great Laker and Boston Celtics teams of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't see them matching up with us," Pippen said. "The Lakers tried (in the 
1991 NBA finals). They weren't as great. We were a different breed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We beat teams with good defense, speed and quickness. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like the Lakers and Celtics did. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Which Laker shares the NBA playoff record for most free throws 
made in a game without a miss? 
</P>
<P>
 Casual guy: Jimmy Hewitt, who was the driving force in landing an NBA team for 
Orlando, Fla., doesn't stand on formality. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Orlando Magic General Manager Pat Williams: "Jimmy's the kind of guy who 
would meet King Henry VIII and call him Hank." 
</P>
<P>
 From The Good Doctor in Inside Sports: Question: How is Bill Laimbeer's new 
career as a sanitation engineer going? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Not bad. He still goes over to Robert Parish's house or Karl Malone's 
driveway to talk trash. 
</P>
<P>
 Add Laimbeer: Parish of the Boston Celtics on the retired Laimbeer of the 
Detroit Pistons: "I've never met someone so dirty. Never. Not even on a 
playground." 
</P>
<P>
 Progress?Time has virtually stood still in regard to the UCLA-USC men's track 
and field rivalry. Of the 21 meet records, two were set in the 1960s, 16 in the 
1970s and 1980s and only three in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 Guillotine mentality: Minnesota Twin right fielder Kirby Puckett on the 
difference between a young player and a superstar: "Used to be the fans knew 
you were trying hard and that's all they cared about. Now, if you have a bad 
day, they want to behead you." 
</P>
<P>
 Spaceman: Colorado outfielder Dante Bichette has a reputation as a bit of a 
flake, but his antics, such as playing Nintendo games until 5 a.m., don't 
bother Manager Don Baylor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dante just flies in for about 3 1/2 hours a day, checks us Earthlings and 
goes on his way. Once you know that, it's fine.' 
</P>
<P>
 Air ball prediction: Dan Barriero of the Star Tribune of Minneapolis on the 
Phoenix-Golden State series: "This will be the best of the first-round 
matchups. For the second straight year, Phoenix will be tested severely in the 
first round and have to go the distance to beat the Warriors, who are playing 
well and playing loose." 
</P>
<P>
 So loose, the Suns swept the Warriors in three games.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is it parity or mediocrity when the NBA playoff team with the worst record 
eliminates the one with the best record?. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I say mediocrity. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Seattle SuperSonics are well balanced, but their defeat by Denver exposed 
their weakness -- the lack of a go-to guy at crunch time. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Nuggets were as poised as their coach, low-key Dan Issel. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Those who voted for David Robinson as the league's most valuable player over 
Hakeem Olajuwon must be having second thoughts. After scoring 71 points on 
closing day of the regular season against the Clippers, the Admiral scored 80 
in four games as the San Antonio Spurs were eliminated by the Utah Jazz. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I don't know about his relationship with Madonna, but Dennis Rodman might have 
worn out his welcome with the Spurs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Barkley and Kevin Johnson protested to NBC interviewer Hannah Storm 
after she said that the Phoenix Suns "stole" one from the Houston Rockets on 
Sunday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 What a day Saturday was for couch potatoes -- Denver's overtime victory over 
Seattle in Game 5, the back-to-back home runs by sluggers Brett Butler and Jose 
Offerman during the Dodgers' victory over San Francisco, the day of Gin and 
Roses at Churchill Downs, and the four title fights from Las Vegas. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If the Julio Cesar Chavez-Frankie Randall bout had been conducted under 
California rules, Randall would have gotten a technical draw instead of an 
eighth-round defeat. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Under World Boxing Council regulations, a point is deducted from a fighter who 
is guilty of an accidental head-butt that results in the fight being 
stopped.There is no such regulation in California. The deduction was the 
difference on one of the two scorecards that had Chavez ahead. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Whatever, Chavez's performance did nothing to change the feeling that Pernell 
Whitaker would dominate even more in a rematch of their absurd draw. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 There is no faster starter in boxing than WBC middleweight champion Gerald 
McClellan, who scored the 20th first-round knockout of his 33-bout career when 
he stopped Julian Jackson in 1 minute 23 seconds. In his three title defenses, 
McClellan has yet to hear a bell ending a round. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A flyweight fight worth waiting for would be between Mark Johnson, the 
fifth-ranked contender who faces Javier Juarez at the Forum tonight, and Danny 
Romero. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Romero, who looked terrific in his local debut Thursday at the Olympic, 
reminds me of former bantamweight contender Jesus Pimentel with his 
explosiveness inside the ring and charming personality outside it. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Lennox Lewis can hit, as he showed against Phil Jackson, but you have to 
wonder if the stiff, upright WBC champion would have any better luck evading 
Michael Moorer's right jab than Evander Holyfield did. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I feel sorry for Randy Winick. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The trainer does a flawless job bringing Brocco into the Kentucky Derby and 
then the horse uncharacteristically loses concentration and gets left in the 
starting gate, for all intents and purposes losing any chance to win. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 You are probably better off drawing numbers out of a hat than trying to 
handicap the Derby. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Since Spectacular Bid's victory in 1979, the average finish of the favorite 
has been eighth. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 There is nobody better in a pinch than Chris McCarron. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 McCarron completed a pinch-hitter's Triple Crown on Saturday aboard Go For 
Gin. The first time he rode Danzig Connection, he won the 1986 Belmont Stakes. 
The first time he rode Pine Bluff, he won the 1992 Preakness. And the second 
time he rode Alysheba, he won the 1987 Kentucky Derby. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Leave it to Charlie Whittingham to have the good sense not to run Strodes 
Creek in the Preakness and wait until the Belmont. Strodes Creek is a 
long-striding horse who is still learning how to run and those tight turns at 
Pimlico would make the Preakness seem like a Formula One race. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 My first Derby Day in Louisville was disappointing because of the rain that 
dampened spirits and a race that lacked suspense. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Based on last season's won-loss records, the Raiders and the Minnesota Vikings 
will have the fourth-toughest schedules in the NFL in 1994. The Rams, Denver, 
New England and Cleveland will have the ninth-toughest. Kansas City and 
Cincinnati will have the toughest and Tampa Bay the easiest. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 John Wooden on Louisville coach and former UCLA guard Denny Crum, who will be 
inducted into the basketball Hall of Fame at Springfield, Mass., today: "He's 
the only player I ever had that, while he was playing, I knew was born to 
coach."

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; ON OFF DAY, MCDONALD IMPROVES TO 7-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ben McDonald didn't have much on his fastball and couldn't get his curve over 
the plate. This year, though, good fortune finally seems to be on his side. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald struggled in becoming baseball's first seven-game winner, and Mike 
Devereaux homered and drove in four runs as the Orioles beat the Cleveland 
Indians, 8-6, Sunday at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald (7-0) allowed six runs and nine hits in 6 1/3 innings. He retired the 
first 12 batters, then allowed 11 of the next 18 to reach base in his worst 
outing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been pretty good this year, but today was a different story," he said. 
"I tricked them as long as I could with what I had, which wasn't a whole lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore, which got a three-run homer from Leo Gomez, led, 8-0, after three 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 8, Boston 4 -- Danny Tartabull, Mike Stanley and Gerald Williams hit 
consecutive home runs in the sixth inning at New York as the Yankees sent the 
Red Sox to their first three-game losing streak of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley homered twice as New York completed its first three-game sweep of the 
Red Sox at Yankee Stadium since June 14-16, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Mo Vaughn homered twice for the Red Sox, giving him three in two games and 
nine this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Tartabull's lead-off homer into the center field bleachers in the sixth inning 
was only the 10th ball hit there since Yankee Stadium reopened in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 3, Milwaukee 1 -- The Blue Jays' Pat Hentgen is so hot he doesn't even 
miss with his predictions. "I told Darren (Hall) before the game that I was 
going to get the win and he would get the save for me," Hentgen said after 
allowing six hits in 8 2/3 innings as the Blue Jays won at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Hentgen (5-2) struck out nine, giving him an American League-leading 49. He 
walked three, including John Jaha with two outs in the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall then came on with a 1-and-0 count on pinch-hitter Tom Brunansky and 
struck him out for the first save of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 5, Texas 2 -- Dave Winfield broke a sixth-inning tie with a two-run, 
two-out homer and Scott Erickson scattered seven hits in his second complete 
game as the Twins won at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Winfield, 42, hit his 456th homer, off Kevin Brown (2-5), after Alex Cole led 
off with a single. The 407-foot drive was the third of the season for Winfield, 
18th on the all-time home run list. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson (3-4) struck out six and walked two as the Twins won for the fifth 
time in seven games. His other complete game was a no-hitter against Milwaukee 
on April 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Former President George Bush made his first visit to The Ballpark in Arlington 
and sat in the stands with his son, George W. Bush, the team's general partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 4, Detroit 3 -- Jay Buhner had three hits, including a go-ahead homer, 
as the Mariners won at Detroit to end a four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Fleming (3-4) broke a three-game losing streak, holding the Tigers to 
three runs on five hits in six innings. He walked three and struck out five. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Belcher (0-6) had his best start of the season, giving up four runs on 
eight hits in eight innings, lowering his ERA from 9.91 to 8.65. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 9, Chicago 7 -- Wally Joyner hit a three-run homer and Felix Jose 
added a two-run homer as the Royals won at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The White Sox committed three errors that led to three unearned runs as they 
fell behind, 9-3. They raised the team total to 36 errors in 29 games.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; BRAVES LEARN EXPOS HAVE PITCHING TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ken Hill agrees the Atlanta Braves have a superb staff. He just wants people 
to know the Montreal Expos also have talented pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill and John Wetteland combined on a three-hitter, and the Expos won, 1-0, 
Sunday at Atlanta, ending the Braves' three-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinch-hitter Randy Milligan had a sacrifice fly in the eighth inning off John 
Smoltz (2-4). 
</P>
<P>
 "John Smoltz was very good today," Hill said. "It was the sort of game where 
one pitch can win it. We got the sac fly and they didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt the Braves have one of the great staffs in the last decade, 
but we're tough, too. We want some respect." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill (6-1) gave up three hits in seven innings and won his fourth consecutive 
start. He struck out five and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
 Wetteland, who had 43 saves last season, got his first of the year in four 
chances. He pitched two perfect innings, striking out the first five batters. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoltz lost his third consecutive decision. He allowed five hits, struck out 
six and walked two in eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Wil Cordero led off the Expos eighth with a triple. One out later, Milligan 
batted for Hill and hit a sacrifice fly to left field. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 5, Cincinnati 0 -- Doug Drabek won his fourth consecutive decision, 
pitching a five-hitter at Houston in his first complete game in seven starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Drabek (4-1) seems to be pitching the way he did in Pittsburgh, where he won 
the Cy Young Award in 1990 and had five winning seasons before leaving as a 
free agent at the end of 1992. He was 9-18 for the Astros last year with two 
shutouts, the last on May 27 against Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 The turnaround began opening day, when he lost, 3-1, to Philadelphia. His 
start Sunday was his best. He gave up only four singles and a double, didn't 
walk anybody and struck out seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Gonzalez, Ken Caminiti and Scott Servais homered off Erik Hanson (2-2) to 
give the Astros a split of their four-game series. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 3, St. Louis 2 -- Bobby Bonilla homered to snap an eighth-inning tie 
at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla hit his sixth home run with one out in the eighth off Willie Smith 
(1-1), who has surrendered four homers in five innings of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 In his last five games, Bonilla has four homers, two doubles and seven RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 9-9, Chicago 2-3 -- Andy Van Slyke went eight for nine as the 
Pirates swept a doubleheader at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates had scored at least nine runs in a game only once this season 
before Sunday. The Cubs lost for the 16th time in 21 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Slyke, breaking out of a season-long slump, homered and drove in four runs 
in the first game, and Lance Parrish had a two-run double for his first 
Pittsburgh hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Slyke was hitting .227 with only four RBIs before the doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 9, Florida 2 -- Ricky Jordan hit a home run, a double and two 
singles at Miami as the Phillies stopped an eight-game road losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Jackson (4-0) stopped Florida's home winning streak at five, a club 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 He gave up seven hits, including a homer by Orestes Destrade, in seven 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 1, San Diego 0 -- Mike Kingery walked with the bases loaded and two 
outs in the ninth inning, giving the Rockies a victory at San Diego. Reliever 
Mark Davis gave up the walk.

MCCARRON DOESN'T EASE UP; HOLLYWOOD PARK: AFTER WINNING THE KENTUCKY DERBY ON 
GO FOR GIN, HE RETURNS TO RIDE FOUR WINNERS IN FIVE RACES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There was no post-Kentucky Derby letdown for Chris McCarron at Hollywood Park 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh from his upset victory aboard Go For Gin at Churchill Downs, McCarron 
won with four of his five mounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The only race that escaped him was the $107,800 Wilshire Handicap. He finished 
third on Miami Sands, beaten by 1 1/4 lengths by favored Skimble. 
</P>
<P>
 Racing on Lasix for the first time after bleeding in the Santa Anita Budweiser 
Breeders' Cup Handicap three weeks earlier, Skimble, the 17-10 choice, ended a 
six-race losing streak in defeating 2-1 second choice Bel's Starlet by 
three-quarters of a length in 1:41 1/5 for the 1 1/16 miles on turf. 
</P>
<P>
 "This field was a probably a little bit easier than the ones she had been 
running against," trainer Bobby Frankel said. "The last time Eddie 
(Delahoussaye) rode her at Santa Anita, he told me she couldn't handle that 
course at all." 
</P>
<P>
 After sitting out the first two races, McCarron continued his big weekend with 
a victory on favored Just Tops in the third, then won at $33.60 with Hot Number 
in the fifth. He skimmed the rail to win with 8-5 choice Desperately in the 
sixth, then completed his day with a second consecutive success on Ravenwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I'm not tired at all," he said. "I feel good. The adrenaline is still 
flowing." Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Wicked North worked six furlongs in 1:11 2/5 Sunday morning at Santa Anita 
and probably will run in the $150,000 Mervyn LeRoy Handicap on Sunday. Trainer 
David Bernstein originally was going to wait for the Californian on June 5, but 
decided to bring the Oaklawn Handicap winner back in the 1 1/16-mile LeRoy. . . 
. Chris McCarron now has ridden 5,979 winners. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Park will simulcast the six-furlong match race between the filly 
Soviet Problem and the gelding Lazor on Thursday from Golden Gate Fields. The 
race carries a $33,000 winner-take-all purse and will be the first match race 
in the Bay Area since 1886. . . . Halloween Treat, who finished last in the 
Spotlight Breeders' Cup Handicap on Saturday and appeared to have been injured 
when squeezed along the rail, was OK Sunday morning, according to trainer Dan 
Hendricks. . . . Jockey Corey Nakatani is a father for the third time. His 
wife, Michelle, the daughter of trainer Wally Dollase, gave birth to Austin, 
who weighed 8 pounds 8 ounces, on Saturday.

 Kevin Eastman, who was 59-53 in four seasons as basketball coach at the 
University of North Carolina Wilmington, has agreed in principle to a five-year 
contract worth more than $1 million to coach at Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastman told Seahawk players of his decision Sunday before leaving for 
Pullman, Wash., where a news conference was scheduled today to announce the 
hiring. 
</P>
<P>
 "They invited him out to review the contract and if everything is there that 
they told him, he will be their new coach," said Paul Miller, Seahawk athletic

</P>
<P>
 The Canadians, who lost to Sweden in a shootout in the Olympic final, ended 
Finland's bid for its first gold medal.

 Earlier, Sweden won the bronze medal with a 7-2 victory over the United 
States, spoiling the Americans' chance for their best finish in 32 years.

 Derby, the English team on which U.S. midfielder John Harkes plays, clinched 
its spot in the English League promotion playoffs by finishing sixth in the 
First Division with a 20-15-11 record. That means Harkes, who is from Kearny, 
N.J., will be unable to join the U.S. national team until Derby wins the 
playoffs or is eliminated. The playoff final is May 29. . . . At Burgos, Spain, 
Real Betis, the club on which U.S. midfielder Tab Ramos plays, gained promotion 
to the Spanish First Division with a 2-0 victory over Burgos, meaning Ramos can 
join the U.S. national team immediately. Track and Field

 Carl Lewis ran a 10.04 100-meter dash in beating the University of Houston's

ANN CONWAY: BOOK, EXHIBIT SAVOR LIFE OF 'FIRST LADY' ATHALIE CLARKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 "The paintings selected for the show are filled with sunlight and warmth -- 
both words that remind me of Athalie. . . . Mrs. Nixon was my First Lady. Mrs. 
Nixon and I always agreed that Athalie was our First Lady."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Richard Nixon, Feb. 4, 1994, "Reflections of California." 
</P>
<P>
 Gathering in the private room at the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace where 
the Presidents and First Ladies were received after Nixon's funeral, about 90 
library supporters celebrated last week's launch of the facility's new art 
exhibit, "Reflections of California, The Athalie Richardson Irvine Clarke 
Memorial Exhibition" sponsored by the Irvine Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The sit-down luncheon, underwritten by Judie and George Argyros of Newport 
Beach, marked the first social event staged at the Yorba Linda library since 
Nixon's burial there on April 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Guest of honor at the not-to-be-missed affair for Orange County's 
social-political set was heiress Joan Irvine Smith, daughter of philanthropist 
and political activist Athalie Clarke (a personal friend and booster of Nixon, 
who, until her death last May at age 90, was considered Orange County's grand 
dame.) 
</P>
<P>
 During the lecture that preceded the Presidential Reception Room luncheon, 
Smith stood before hundreds of spectators in the library auditorium to touch on 
the highlights of her mother's life via a slide presentation of family 
photographs and the exhibit's California Impressionist paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to create a memorial to my mother that would make her live in the 
hearts of those who knew her and introduce her to those who had never known 
her," said Smith, speaking of the exhibit and "California Reflections," the 
art/history book she has published about Clarke's life. "I hope, through this 
book, I have been able to achieve this." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Smith has published a 185-page volume that will keep Orange County society 
buzzing for months. In the book, Clarke, who was always quiet and ultra-private 
when she moved in social circles, shares never-before-revealed secrets of her 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 There's candid talk of how Clarke, before her marriage in 1929 to James Irvine 
Jr. (Jase) was threatened by his ex-wife, Madeleine: "Only one thing marred 
that beautiful day," she wrote. "The awful letter Jase had received from 
Madeleine. It stated I would never reach the altar alive. I would have a bullet 
through my head before the service began." 
</P>
<P>
 (On the following page is a picture of the intrepid bride, resplendent in 
Belgian lace, smiling as she stood on the altar. They would honeymoon for three 
months at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel on Waikiki Beach.) 
</P>
<P>
 The book also contains a lively account of the antics performed by her 
father-in-law, Irvine ranch owner James Irvine II, during a 1929 Fourth of July 
celebration at Irvine Cove: "As fast as he could break off a half or dozen or 
more (firecrackers), he would light them and toss them under the ladies' 
chairs. Some of the women were so startled they jumped out of their chairs. 
Others just fell out. My father-in-law was convulsed with laughter." 
</P>
<P>
 And mention of a harrowing dinner party that involved James Irvine II and a 
fireplace: Her guests were enjoying coffee in the living room, Clarke wrote, 
and suddenly her father-in-law came through the front door with "four or five 
pointers" in tow. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were a lively bunch until Mr. Irvine took a seat in his favorite chair. 
He stroked each one . . . (then) produced a tennis ball wound around with very 
strong string and . . . threw the ball into the fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each one of the dogs tried to retrieve the ball from the fire. One of them 
did and brought it to Mr. Irvine. The others barked, yelped and shook their 
ears. Some of them were badly singed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the book's most poignant passages recalls the time when the newborn 
Smith -- named Athalie Anita until Smith changed it to Joan when she was 4 
years old -- was critically ill. A blood transfusion saved her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it was nothing but a miracle that she had lived," Clarke wrote. "It 
was then I promised my father I would always do whatever I could for the 
medical profession for as long as I lived. I have been asked many times why I 
have so much interest in anything medically oriented. I have not shared the 
real reason before." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's words are interspersed with Clarke's throughout the book (which is 
available at the library for $40 per copy). On one of the final pages, Smith 
wrote of her mother's peaceful death, which occurred during one of Clarke's 
daily naps in her art-filled Belcourt home: "When I reached her home, I went to 
her bedside and looked down into her sleeping face. To my amazement, the years 
and the pain had vanished from her countenance and she was once again my 
beautiful young mother I remembered when I was a girl."

JACK SMITH: GRAMMAR RULES WILL LIVE ON -- HOPEFULLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Intellectual pastimes have vogues, like women's fashions. One year trousers 
are in; the next year, short skirts. Happily, one rarely hears from the 
deconstructionists anymore. Only a year or two ago, deconstruction was 
infecting our campuses like a virus. 
</P>
<P>
 I never really understood deconstruction, but I think it held that, if 
subjected to enlightened analysis, nothing ever written makes any sense. It was 
certainly true that the deconstructionists themselves didn't make any sense. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest plague, I notice, is an attack on standard grammar as it is 
practiced by the self-styled maven William Safire and the authors of grammar 
and style books. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly we have been bombarded by treatises on grammar in recent years. My 
bookshelves are loaded with them. I am no maven, nor even a grammarian, though 
I try to write by the rules, if only for the sake of clarity. 
</P>
<P>
 But I realize language is a living, changing phenomenon, and I am not bound to 
outmoded rules. I have read Theodore Bernstein's "Miss Thistlebottom's 
Hobgoblins" and no longer fear to split an infinitive or end a sentence with a 
preposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently my friend Alfred Wolf sent me, without comment, an article from the 
New Republic by Steven Pinker, a professor in the Department of Brain and 
Cognitive Sciences at MIT and author of "The Language Instinct." 
</P>
<P>
 Pinker's article is a defense of English as it is spoken, and not as the 
"mavens" say it should be spoken. He is especially hard on Safire, whose essays 
"On Language" in the New York Times Magazine I find enlightened and charming. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinker is only one of several linguists (for lack of a more definitive word) 
to argue that the rules of grammar as stated by people like Safire and "his 
group"' are silly. "Maven, Shmaven!" he snorts. "Kibitzers and nudniks is more 
like it. For here are the remarkable facts. Most of the prescriptive rules for 
the language mavens are bits of folklore that originated for screwball reasons 
several hundred years ago. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 With one breath he blows away all the rules we learned from our grammar books 
in school. In one quite grammatical sentence he says: "Indeed, most of the 
'ignorant errors' these rules are supposed to correct display an elegant logic 
and an acute sensitivity to the grammar and texture of the language, to which 
the mavens are oblivious." 
</P>
<P>
 Far be it from me to take lightly the counsel of a professor of brain and 
cognitive sciences. What chance does an old rule like verbs and nouns ought to 
agree in number have against that kind of academician? 
</P>
<P>
 Pinker easily demolishes a couple of silly complaints of mine against what I 
consider misuse of the language. He says there is nothing wrong with hopefully 
in the sense of "It is hoped" or "We hope." He notes that the alternatives "It 
is hoped that" and "If hopes are realized" display four sins of bad writing: 
passive voice, needless words, vagueness, pomposity. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinker also defends "I could care less" when "I couldn't care less" is clearly 
intended, arguing that the phrase is delivered in a tone of sarcasm that makes 
its meaning obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Pinker's learning could spare me the embarrassment I felt recently 
when a friend, Laura Segal Stegman, pointed out a grammatical error of mine in 
a column. 
</P>
<P>
 "Enjoyed your column . . . about the Hollywood High School Museum," she 
writes, "but I was shocked at your glaring grammatical gaffe in the second 
paragraph." She points out that in recalling when Duke Russell read Lincoln's 
Gettysburg Address in the Hollywood Bowl a year ago, I wrote that "his only 
auditors were me and his daughter Colleen. . . ." She adds: "If you were a 
student in my monthly grammar seminar (through the Learning Annex) I would have 
to give you a failing grade." 
</P>
<P>
 I was about to concede that "me and Colleen" was my first error of the year, 
but wait. Perhaps Prof. Pinker can come to my aid. He defends George Bush 
against Safire's criticism of his campaign slogan, "Who Can You Trust?" on the 
grounds that whom is "clearly moribund." Similarly, he defends Bill Clinton's 
"Give Al Gore and I a chance" with an argument so convoluted that I can't even 
paraphrase it, much less explain it. But it ends, "By the logic of grammar, the 
pronoun is free to have any case it wants." You dig that? 
</P>
<P>
 Although Pinker does not deal specifically with such locutions as "me and 
Colleen," I'm sure a master of cognitive science would find a way to justify 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, I conclude that I have yet to make my first error in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, Pinker's essay, like most essays by his debunking colleagues, 
adheres strictly to the old-fashioned rules of grammar. In other words, as free 
as he is with other people's prose, him don't make no mistakes in his own.

MUSEUMS ARE GOING WITH FLOW; TRENDS: TO BOOST INCOME, MANY ARE OFFERING THEMED 
PRODUCTS -- SUCH AS PILGRIM BEER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NELSON WANG, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About the only history most people associate with beer and potato chips is one 
of indigestion and regrettable overindulgence. 
</P>
<P>
 But two museums, Mystic Seaport in Connecticut and Plimoth Plantation in 
Massachusetts, are out to show otherwise -- and to make some money. 
</P>
<P>
 Mystic, a re-creation of a 19th-Century seacoast community, recently began 
marketing a line of potato chips harking back to the first chips invented in 
Saratoga Springs, N.Y., in 1853. 
</P>
<P>
 And Plimoth Plantation, a preservation of a 1627 Pilgrim settlement, has 
unveiled Plimoth Rock Ale, a beer brewed from corn malts similar to what the 
Pilgrims used soon after they arrived in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Blame a weak economy for the marketing ploys. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing a lot more aggressive strategies . . . that are all designed to 
get income from more than just people coming in the door," said Laura Roberts, 
executive director of the New England Museum Assn., which represents about 200 
museums and historical attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, museum attendance has remained stable. But many museums are being 
squeezed by shrinking state and federal budgets, according to Patricia 
Williams, deputy director of the American Assn. of Museums. 
</P>
<P>
 So while museums have always run gift stores to supplement income, licensing 
products is seen as an important revenue generator. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Henry Ford Museum in Michigan, for example, which chronicles the 
country's industrial revolution, visitors can buy reproductions of any of the 
more than 100 artifacts from the 18th and 19th centuries, including lamps, 
furniture, clocks and pottery. 
</P>
<P>
 At Conner Prairie in Indiana, a re-creation of an 1836 rural Indiana town, 
salt-glazed and spongeware pottery popular during this era have been big 
sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sturbridge Village in central Massachusetts, which re-creates an 1830s rural 
community, recently began selling 19th-Century plants and trees from seeds 
saved by gardeners over the years. One of the biggest sellers has been apple 
trees that once dotted the Sturbridge landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 The village's horticultural program, which includes garden tools and 
accessories as well as plant material, is expected to bring in about $50,000 
next year, according to Sturbridge's president, Alberta Sebolt George. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, which already has an extensive 
licensing program, recently entered a licensing agreement for an educational 
computer software program called "Mystery at the Museums." 
</P>
<P>
 At Plimoth Plantation, attendance has declined 25% since 1988. In response, 
the plantation recently undertook a campaign to intensify its fund-raising and 
license products such as Plimoth Rock Ale. 
</P>
<P>
 Mystic Seaport licensed its Mystic potato chips for sale in New England last 
year after selling them at the museum for two years. The seaport is expected to 
net about $12,000 this year on sales of more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 With all the products being introduced, some in the museum business recognize 
the potential for diluting their historical mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a danger that you begin to get an image of these places as not 
museums, but bookshops and stores and cafes," Roberts said.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD; 
MALIBU: COASTAL COLONY'S RESPONSE TO ITS DAY-WORKER DILEMMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by Times researcher CATHERINE GOTTLIEB 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Famous folk, fires and floods distinguish Malibu from other Southern 
Californian cities, but like many of its neighbors, the coastal city has been 
grappling with how to respond to the more than 100 laborers who daily gather on 
street corners and parking lots in search of work. It has been a 
time-consuming, difficult and sometimes rancorous process that one task force 
member working on the project likened to "doing calculus without knowing 
algebra." The result was a ban on city-sponsored Malibu Labor Exchange Center. 
This approach seems to be working. According to Mona Loo, a 10-year Malibu 
resident and board member of the nonprofit group that runs the Labor Exchange. 
"The Malibu Times ran a story that said, '91-year-old woman busted for hiring 
day laborer.' We all sort of cringed, but the result was that our work requests 
doubled." FOUR POINTS OF CONTENTION 
</P>
<P>
 Residents and business owners complain that day workers litter, drink liquor 
in public, frighten customers, and disrupt residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials say that vehicles slowing and stopping to hire 
workers can create traffic and safety hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 Civil rights advocates say ordinances prohibiting day workers from 
congregating to solicit employment or prohibiting employers from picking up day 
laborers violate citizens' rights to work and solicit for employment. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say there's no quick-fix, one-size-fits-all solution that will 
serve community interests and rights of residents, business owners and day 
workers because communities are, in effect, coping with the local impacts of 
national and international issues like immigration, high employment and 
homelessness. HOW THEY GOT THERE 
</P>
<P>
 May 1990 
</P>
<P>
 Without community consensus or study of the day worker situation, nonprofit 
day worker advocacy organization opens a hiring center.  
</P>
<P>
 November 1990 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby residents claim that the number of workers at street corners hasn't 
noticeably fallen. They also complain and L.A. County Department of Regional 
Planning officials agree that the house trailer used as the center's office 
violates zoning laws.  
</P>
<P>
 March 1991 
</P>
<P>
 With little community support, the hiring center closes. 
</P>
<P>
 October 1991 
</P>
<P>
 City council forms Day Worker Task Force to study Malibu's day labor 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 December 1991 
</P>
<P>
 The task force recommends regulation of day labor employment by establishing 
an official hiring center in the city and passing an ordinance to prohibit 
employers from hiring laborers at unauthorized sites. 
</P>
<P>
 July 1992 
</P>
<P>
 The city passes an ordinance placing limits on hiring laborers. 
</P>
<P>
 August 31, 1993 
</P>
<P>
 The Malibu Labor Exchange Center opens with support from city and county 
officials. The city arranges annual funding of $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
 November 2-3, 1993 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the city's exclusive Villa Costera area credit eight day laborers 
for working, at great personal risk, throughout the day and night to help save 
homes during the killer fire. They worked at great personal risk, without being 
asked and for no pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Today 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Exchange Center report that day laborer congregation has decreased 
at three of the four sites where the workers typically gather. More than 30 
workers report to the center each day; about 20 work requests are made daily. 
SOME CHOICES CITIES MAKE 
</P>
<P>
 Ways that local governments respond to the presence of day workers in their 
communities: Direct police to move day workers from sites where residents or 
businesses have complained, and increase enforcement of unlawful behaviors like 
illegal turns, blocking driveways, littering and drunkenness; 
</P>
<P>
 Prohibit laborers from congregating to solicit work and prohibit employers 
from soliciting and picking up day laborers in certain areas; 
</P>
<P>
 Organize hiring halls for workers and educate employers and workers about INS 
regulations, workers' rights and community standards. 
</P>

<P>
 MALIBU'S LABOR EXCHANGE CENTER was established from recommendations by a 
committee representing resident, business, day worker, law enforcement and 
municipal points of view. The center is managed by two paid employees and 
volunteers. It is located near a public bus line, away from residential and 
business areas. The center provides day laborers with English instruction, 
access to public restrooms, telephones and a noon meal. A lottery is used to 
match day workers with employers.

GOLF ROUNDUP; BARRAGE OF BIRDIES BRINGS VICTORY TO DOUGLASS, COODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dale Douglass and Charles Coody, who waltzed to a seven-shot victory in the 
1990 Legends of Golf, worked much harder this year, winning the PGA Senior Tour 
tournament Sunday at Austin, Tex., by one stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 The team of Chi Chi Rodriguez and Jim Dent eagled the 18th hole to tie with 
that of Bob Murphy and Jim Colbert for second. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglass and Coody had led by two shots, then fell behind by a stroke at the 
10th hole. They made five birdies in a row on the back side to shoot 64 for a 
28-under total of 188 in the two-man, better-ball event at the Barton Creek 
Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 They cut it close on the final hole. Leading by one stroke, Douglass drove the 
ball into trees on the right and Coody found the right rough. 
</P>
<P>
 With his partner having to lay up, Coody hit a four-iron 175 yards uphill, the 
ball falling within two feet of a canyon that cuts in front of the green. He 
pitched on and two-putted for the par that saved the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pretty close," Coody said, appreciating the victory if not the 
artistry. "But it was over the hazard. That's what counts. I just wish I'd hit 
a little bit better shot." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Davies continued a hot streak with a four-under 68, beating Meg Mallon 
by a stroke in winning the Sara Lee Classic at Hermitage Golf Course in 
Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Mallon, the defending champion, missed a birdie putt on the par-four 18th that 
would have forced a playoff. She finished with a 69 and was one behind Davies' 
54-hole total of 203. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the seventh tour victory for Davies, who won the Standard Register Ping 
tournament in March and finished second in the Nabisco Dinah Shore a week 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 She and Mallon shot identical scores of 65 and 70 over the first two rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Davies finally took a one-stroke lead with a birdie on the par-five 11th. 
Mallon slipped two strokes off the pace with a bogey on No. 16 before a birdie 
on No. 17 pulled her within one stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Seve Ballesteros is a winner again, ending a 26-month drought with a 
three-stroke victory over Nick Faldo in the Benson and Hedges Open in Plymouth, 
England, that will qualify him for next month's U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballesteros birdied two of the final three holes to stave off a late charge by 
Faldo and shoot a two-under 70 to finish at seven-under 281 and win $163,000. 
</P>
<P>
 His last victory had been in March of 1992.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; STRAWBERRY'S STATUS STILL UNCERTAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For now, the Dodgers are not considering releasing Darryl Strawberry when he 
is ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
 'That's not something that we are thinking about," said Fred Claire, Dodger 
executive vice president. "He is still a part of this team. He's in 
(outpatient) treatment . . . when (Strawberry) is finished with his treatment, 
we will all sit down and talk." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chan Ho Park made his fourth start for double-A San Antonio, and while he has 
yet to pitch more then five innings because he is on a pitch count, Claire said 
Park is doing well enough to be promoted to Los Angeles if the team has an 
opening.  
</P>
<P>
 "He has continued to make progress and is the leading candidate at this 
point," said Claire, who added that he sees no need to promote Park to triple-A 
Albuquerque first. "He's doing well there, and he's getting a chance to pitch 
and spend time with (pitching coach) Burt Hooton. Whereas he loved it (in Los 
Angeles), he knew and we knew he was not getting enough pitching. There he 
pitches every five days." 
</P>
<P>
 Park, who has started four games, has a 2.20 earned-run average with 25 
strikeouts in 16 1/3 innings. But he has also given up 10 walks and made two 
wild pitches. In his start on Saturday, he gave up two home runs in 4 2/3 
innings and was pulled from the game because he had already thrown 100 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While batting in the fifth inning of Friday's game, Pedro Astacio squared to 
bunt and the pitch hit his right hand. He stayed in the game and X-rays taken 
after the game were negative. But his hand swelled later that night, and was 
still swollen Sunday. Astacio said he doesn't expect to skip his start 
Wednesday against the Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Mondesi's bruised left heel has improved. "The problem is he jumps at the 
(first base) bag," trainer Bill Buhler said. "We keep telling him not to do it, 
but he does it anyway.". . . . Barry Bonds, starting his first game since being 
hit by a pitch on the elbow by the New York Mets' Eric Hillman, still isn't 
happy about it. "If he hits me again, he better call an ambulance," Bonds said. 
"I'll chase him into the clubhouse. I don't care." Bonds who didn't start three 
games of this series, made up for it quickly Sunday, getting singles in his 
first two at-bats, including a run-scoring line drive in the third that put the 
Giants ahead, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Five of six Giants got hits in the third, including a softly hit single by 
pitcher Salomon Torres. But Torres hasn't spent a lot of time running bases -- 
it was his first hit this season -- and after returning safely to the bag, he 
stepped off -- and Eric Karros tagged him out.  
</P>

 Al Osuna, whose Dodger debut came Saturday against Bonds in the 10th inning, 
said he got a full dose of the Dodger-Giant rivalry. "As soon as I took the 
mound, with the crowd and all, I could feel it," Osuna said. MARYANN HUDSON

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; LANGSTON ON TRACK TO START IN TEXAS 
</P>

 One day after impressing Angel teammates and management during a four-inning 
simulated game, Mark Langston said his left arm felt fine. He will play catch 
today and, if he remains pain free, probably will start against the Texas 
Rangers on Wednesday at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Langston underwent arthroscopic elbow surgery on April 12 after only one 
start, a victory over Minnesota on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Langston and (Chuck) Finley have to be the horses for us," Manager Buck 
Rodgers said. "If they don't win, we're not going to win. If they don't get 15 
to 17 wins (each), we're going to be in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The results of an MRI exam, a CAT scan and X-rays on first baseman Eduardo 
Perez's injured wrist were all negative. The status of Perez, suffering from a 
sprained ligament, is listed as day to day and Rodgers said he will be 
available by Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't expect the Angels to call up J.T. Snow to replace Perez any time soon, 
however. For starters, Rodgers is pleased with the play of Jim Edmonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no idea Jimmy Edmonds could play first base that well," Rodgers said. 
"I want J.T. to come up here when he's hot. It's not an automatic that J.T. is 
coming up. I think J.T. can still be a major league first baseman." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow is batting .287 with four home runs and 20 RBIs at triple-A Vancouver.

 Bo Jackson ended a 21-at-bat slump with a run-scoring single in the first 
inning. It was his first hit against Oakland since Sept. 18, 1991, when he was 
with the Chicago White Sox. . . . Rookie catcher Jorge Fabregas went two for 
four with an RBI. He is batting .371 in 11 games since Greg Myers went on the 
disabled list. . . . Dennis Eckersley's first save, in his fourth save 
opportunity of the season, on Saturday night came in the Athletics' 30th game. 
He had five saves, in nine opportunities, after 30 games last season. . . . The 
AL West was 23-50 against the AL East before Sunday's games. ELLIOTT TEAFORD

 Atlanta Brave pitcher Greg Maddux suffered a deep bruise on his left cheek 
when he was hit by a foul ball, but is not expected to skip his next start. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddux was sitting in the Braves' first-base dugout when he was struck by a 
line drive hit by the Montreal Expos' Cliff Floyd in the eighth inning. Maddux 
was taken to a hospital for X-rays, which were negative. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddux is 5-2 with an 0.94 ERA in seven starts, and is trying this season to 
become the first pitcher to win three consecutive Cy Young awards. His next 
start is scheduled for Wednesday at home against Philadelphia.

COLLEGE ROUNDUP; FERGUSON, TITANS SWEEP NEW MEXICO STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Ferguson and his Cal State Fullerton teammates completed an impressive 
weekend with a 15-5 victory over New Mexico State in a Big West Conference 
baseball game Sunday in Las Cruces, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson had two hits, including his 10th home run, and drove in two runs for 
the Titans (39-10, 15-5), the third-ranked team in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson's performance capped an amazing four-game stretch during which he was 
14 for 18 and drove in 15 runs. He had two doubles, five home runs, scored two 
runs and stole three bases. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans scored 53 runs and had 57 hits in the sweep of New Mexico State. 
Fullerton raised its team average from .288 to .299 in the series. 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Millan and Sal Mancuso had three hits and Mark Kotsay and Jason Gill each 
had two hits for Fullerton. The score was tied, 5-5, after six innings, but the 
Titans scored five runs in the seventh, four in the eighth and one in the 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Ricabal (8-0) gave up 11 hits and five runs in six innings but earned the 
victory. Ted Silva gave up a hit and no runs in the final three innings for his 
11th save. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweep leaves Fullerton one game in front of second-place Nevada (13-5 in 
conference), which took a doubleheader from San Jose State on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada ends conference play with a three-game series at UC Santa Barbara 
starting Friday. If Nevada sweeps the series, then Fullerton would have to make 
up its game with Pacific, which was rained out earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
 In the National Christian Colligate Athletic Assn. softball championship: 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Christian 4, Central Wesleyan (S.C.) 2 -- Rhonda Staton's sacrifice 
fly in the seventh broke a 2-2 tie for Pacific Christian in the championship 
game, which ended late Saturday. Greta Carlson (15-12) pitched a five-hitter 
for the victory. Carlson, who won three games and struck out 49 in 30 innings, 
was the tournament's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 In Big West Conference softball: 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada Las Vegas 1-7, Cal State Fullerton 0-1 -- Sara Mallett, from La Habra 
High School, had a home run, a double and drove in three runs for host Nevada 
Las Vegas (34-16, 22-6), the seventh-ranked team in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon Dolan had a double in each game for Fullerton (28-27, 17-11).

SLATER WINS KATIN TEAM CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kelly Slater had not won an individual surfing championship at the Huntington 
Beach Pier in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 So why not win two titles Sunday? 
</P>
<P>
 Slater easily won the individual championship and then helped Team Focus to 
the tag-team title at the 16th Katin Team Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Competing in three- to four-foot conditions, Slater scored a perfect 10 on one 
of his waves and finished with a four-wave total of 100.8 on the three judges' 
scorecards. He easily outdistanced second-place Shane Beschen of San Clemente 
(95.6). 
</P>
<P>
 Slater, 1992 world champion, also scored a 17.0 on a double-scoring wave to 
lead Team Focus to a winning score of 228.5, well ahead of second-place Team 
Quiksilver (205.1). 
</P>
<P>
 Slater, 22, of Cocoa Beach, Fla., earned $1,000 by winning the individual 
title and shared the $4,000 first-place prize money with Focus teammates Rob 
Machado of Cardiff, and Shane Dorian and Conan Hayes of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always wanted to win a pro contest here," Slater said. "This isn't a big 
money contest, but it's a great event. Tom Curren has won it, and so has Martin 
Potter. That's a pretty good list right there." 
</P>
<P>
 Although considered a fun contest, the Katin is situated during a break on the 
world tour and regularly attracts the top U.S. surfers. Sunday's individual 
final featured Slater, Machado, Beschen and Carlsbad's Taylor Knox -- all 
ranked among the top 16 on the world tour. 
</P>
<P>
 After falling on his first two waves, Slater scored a 9.17 on his third wave 
and added the 10 -- believed to be the first perfect score in the history of 
the competition -- on his sixth wave. 
</P>
<P>
 The perfect score was a typical Slater highlight film -- five big backside 
maneuvers off the lip. After finishing his last move, he nearly ran into his 
good friend, Machado, who was paddling back out after catching a wave. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rob tried to throw his board at me," Slater said, grinning. "That was just 
one of those waves where you just keep going off the lip, and it keeps going 
and going and going." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Slater's first victory in Huntington Beach since leading Team USA to 
the 1992 Op Pro title, and it was his first individual championship since 
taking the 1989 Op Junior amateur title, the year before he became a 
professional. 
</P>
<P>
 It also was his third victory in six events this year, which includes a 
victory in April at Bell's Beach, Australia, the first stop on the Assn. of 
Surfing Professionals' world tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm batting .500 right now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Slater is hoping that momentum will carry over for the rest of the world tour. 
He's trying to rebound from a disappointing sixth-place finish last season, 
when he struggled with a nagging knee injury, equipment problems and 
distractions in filming the TV series "Baywatch." 
</P>
<P>
 No distractions this season. No TV obligations. The knee is fine. And 
boardshaper Al Merrick has armed Slater with a new arsenal of boards that the 
former world champion says are working better than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been really nice (this year)," Slater said. "I think the main thing is 
my boards. I didn't have the confidence in my boards last year that I do this 
year." Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Bud Pro Surfing tour stop at Huntington State Beach begins Wednesday just 
north of the Santa Ana River Jetties. . . . Kelly Slater and current world 
champion Derek Ho of Hawaii are expected to compete. . . . The ASP world tour 
resumes May 25 at the Marui Pro in Japan. . . . The West Coast Pro-Am surfing 
tour continues June 11-12 with the Body Glove Open at 54th St. Beach in Newport 
Beach. Results

FOOTNOTES /JAMES BATES: DANCES WITH AUCTIONEERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the better investments in the past 16 years could turn out to be a 1978 
yearbook from Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 A Hollywood memorabilia auction scheduled next Saturday by Corona-based 
Odyssey Auctions at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel includes a yearbook being 
offered for an estimated $400 to $500. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? According to the catalogue, the yearbook features "a young Kevin 
Costner's portrait (with) his other classmates." 
</P>
<P>
 The catalogue calls the yearbook a "highly desirable collection from one of 
today's hottest and most private actors." 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, university officials are a bit surprised that the yearbook -- 
which they say probably sold originally for no more than $30 -- might fetch 
that much. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Boggs, assistant alumni director, says the university's 1992 yearbook 
might prove a better bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 She says that version of the college's yearbook includes a batch of pictures 
of the actor -- who next stars in the upcoming film "Wyatt Earp" -- taken when 
he paid a visit to his alma mater. Not Off and Running Yet 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Park last week gambled that it will get a license to operate a card 
club casino by disclosing it will begin building what the race track boasts 
will be the nation's biggest neon sign. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-foot red sign, which will read "Casino," is only 15 feet shorter than 
the famous "HOLLYWOOD" sign. 
</P>
<P>
 So what do state officials -- who are still doing background checks on the 
club's prospective operators -- think about putting up the sign at this point? 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Wiley, manager for the California attorney general's gaming 
registration unit, said that it's OK with her, "just as long as it doesn't say 
'Open' on it." Not Scoring So Well 
</P>
<P>
 Just in the bookstores is the paperback version of the management book "MBA" 
by Boston Celtics President Red Auerbach. 
</P>
<P>
 The book, whose title abbreviation stands for "Management by Auerbach," notes 
that it includes tips "from the leader of one of America's most successful 
organizations." 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the most recent public documents filed by the Boston Celtics Limited 
Partnership shows that the club's success has been mixed lately. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the things revealed in a management discussion and analysis for the six 
months ended Dec. 31: 
</P>
<P>
 * Revenue from ticket sales fell $28,000 from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 * Television and radio broadcast revenue fell $752,000, or 4%, from a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the positive side of things, expenses fell $769,000 due to the retirement 
of highly paid forward Kevin McHale. Briefly . . .  
</P>
<P>
 More auction: Marilyn Monroe's final divorce decree from baseball star Joe 
DiMaggio is being auctioned for $1,500 to $2,000. . . . A program for an 
electronic banking conference this month aboard the Queen Mary, rocked by 
uncertainty off and on for the past few years, reads "sail into smooth seas." . 
. . A company that bolts homes to their foundations asks in ads how safe your 
home is "on a scale of 1 to 7.4."

SHOP TALK; GOOD WORK WILL TAKE PRESSURE OFF OF WORKING PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: I took an exciting new job a few months ago at a big company. During 
my interview, I explained that I have a newborn baby and am not interested in 
working late hours. But with one deadline after another, I have been putting in 
at least 50 hours a week ever since I started. I'm in management, so I don't 
get compensatory time off. Still, this is a prestigious company, and I'd like 
to do well. How can I handle this situation without appearing less than 
dedicated and ending up on the "mommy track"? 
</P>
<P>
 -- M.S., Tustin 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: You didn't say what type of work you were doing when working late 
hours to try to beat deadlines. Is it the kind of work that you could do at 
home, or do you have to work as part of a team? 
</P>
<P>
 If it is the former, perhaps some of this "extra" work could be done at home 
evenings or weekends. As long as the work gets done, your co-workers and 
supervisors probably won't mind if you're not working into the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 I can appreciate your concern with not wanting to be stereotyped because you 
are unable to always work late hours. Yet, if you are a valuable worker, and 
you are getting the job done, there is no logical reason why you should be 
viewed by colleagues as "non-dedicated." Succeeding in a company and being a 
good parent don't have to be incompatible. 
</P>
<P>
 This doesn't mean, however, that you won't be unfairly stereotyped. It happens 
all the time. The issue of impression management -- controlling how you appear 
to others -- is a hot topic. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years back, there was an entire book of research on the topic (Giacalone 
& Rosenfeld's "Impression Management in the Organization," Erlbaum Press). The 
upshot of some of this research is that people spend a lot of time trying to 
manage the impressions they make on others in the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Careful impression management, coupled with good levels of work performance, 
should help you to keep from being stereotyped as "non-dedicated." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ron Riggio, professor of industrial and organizational psychology, Cal 
State Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 Question: I'm a sales representative for an oil company based in Texas. I was 
transferred to the Irvine office five years ago. My wife, children and I are 
very happy here. But now my supervisor wants to start a three-year rotation 
system "to give other people a chance to live in California," and he alerted me 
that I have to go back to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 When I moved, the company and I had an understanding that it was a permanent 
relocation. What can I do, short of finding another job -- which wouldn't be 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A.E., Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: You need to make your supervisor aware of the understanding you had 
with the company that the move was a permanent relocation. Was there any 
correspondence that mentioned this fact? Who in the company promised you that 
it was permanent? 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that your case for staying would be pretty strong if you had some 
evidence of a promise, or someone who could vouch for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Your supervisor may not have thought out all the repercussions of this new 
rotation plan. Maybe you could make him aware of some issues. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the moving costs and "downtime" while new representatives learn 
new territories and procedures could represent significant costs to the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 A cost-benefit analysis might show that the plan doesn't make sense. There 
might also be resistance to the plan from other reps. Maybe some of them don't 
want to relocate to California. If you are unhappy with having to move, maybe 
some of the other reps will be too.

 Returned to Sender: Gospel singer Michael English returned the four gospel 
music Dove Awards he won last week, including one for artist of the year, as a 
top gospel official confirmed the singer had had an extramarital affair. Gospel 
Music Assn. president Bruce Koblish said Friday that English told him he was 
involved with another gospel singer, Marabeth Jordan. Both English and Jordan 
are married. Koblish said the group would consider giving the awards back to 
English next week since the Dove Awards have no morals or character clause. 
Jordan's band, First Call, has replaced her, but hasn't said why.

 Quake Drains Funds: Southern California's Jan. 17 earthquake is rocking the 
New York City-based Actors' Fund of America, which helps theater and 
entertainment industry folks. The unexpected cash drain threatens to surpass 
even the fund's annual AIDS expenditures, which have mushroomed in recent 
years. So far, $7.6 million has been spent in earthquake relief, and nearly 
four months after the temblor, the fund is still deluged by requests from 
earthquake victims and is in danger of going over its $10.4-million budget. The 
fund, whose trustees include actress Lynn Redgrave and directors Harold Prince 
and Sidney Lumet, raises much of its revenue from Broadway benefit shows. QUICK

POP REVIEW; GRAND DIVAS IN SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Fluffed, flawless and fierce," was top diva Sheryl Lee Ralph's description of 
the performers in her "Divas: Simply Singing" benefit concert at the Wilshire 
Ebell Theatre on Saturday. And it would be hard to find a more accurate 
characterization of a lineup ranging from the classic Linda Hopkins and Delores 
Hall to the awesome Chaka Khan and CeCe Peniston. 
</P>
<P>
 In the four years since Ralph began producing the series, the presentation has 
progressed rapidly from the occasionally uneven initial programs to Saturday's 
slick, professional production. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the high-visibility younger performers were upstaged by veterans, by 
"divas-in-training" and by comedians. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopkins and Hall, for example, offered stunning re-examinations of the blues, 
while Mavis Staples and Ann Bennett-Nesby vividly recalled the gospel sounds 
that are the foundation of much contemporary pop singing. Tiny Raven-Symone and 
12-year-old Jessica James, in particular, sang with energy, authority and 
creativity that belied their youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Khan, impishly choosing "Alfie" as her showcase number, demonstrated why she 
is viewed by many as the diva of divas. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most impressive show-stealers were the vocal group For Real, singing 
an audience-rousing a cappella number, and singer-comedian Jenifer Lewis. 
Perhaps a more complete talent than any other performer on stage, Lewis 
perfectly defined both the camp and the creative aspects of diva-ness. DON

DANCE REVIEW; CRITTERS AND DROLL DREAMERS AT THE BALLET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC/DANCE CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cute, cute, cute. Also long, long, long. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Performing Arts Center housed a lot of furry critters in toe 
shoes this weekend. The excuse was "Tales of Beatrix Potter," courtesy of the 
Royal Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 One wants to say Frederick Ashton's "Tales of Beatrix Potter." That, alas, may 
stretch veracity a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashton created a fanciful film about Potter's nursery menagerie back in 1971. 
He ennobled it with his own quintessentially refined portrait of Mrs. 
Tiggywinkle, the adorable hedgehog-washerwoman who frames the inaction with 
wistful country dances and spiffy music-hall routines. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashton never intended his Technicolored jeux d'esprit for the so-called living 
theater. Last year at Christmastime, however, his cinematic inventions were 
resurrected for the Royal Ballet by Anthony Dowell. Take that, "Nutcracker." 
</P>
<P>
 Dowell's intentions must have been noble. Nevertheless, his act of would-be 
homage earned grudging thanks, at best. Critics in London complained that much 
had been lost in the translation of choreography from screen to stage, and the 
master would not have approved. For all its understated humor, Dowell's 
faux-Ashton indulgence reportedly made too much of a flimsy thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 As presented at Segerstrom Hall during the Royal valedictory on Saturday, 
"Tales of Beatrix Potter" looked like a ballet that would appeal to kids of all 
ages from 7 to 9 1/2 -- for about 30 minutes. Unfortunately, it lasted 70. 
</P>
<P>
 Bone-fide balletomanes -- timeless, ageless and ever-sophisticated -- could 
take comfort in small in-jokes. The adorable Pigling Bland partnered his dark 
ballerina-hog, the adorable Pig-wig, in a hammy, rapturous Ashtonesque pas de 
deux. An adorable waltzing mouse corps used a tangle of adorable tails as 
ribbons in an adorable Maypole ritual. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Jeremy Fisher, the adorable frog prince with the ballooning ballon, found 
new dramatic meaning in the grand jete. Assorted adorable rodents went 
a-courting and a-marching. Peter Rabbit, an adorable also-hopped, danced an 
adorable tarantella. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, the adorable Jemima Puddleduck, past mistress of the silent 
quack, undulated her molting wings in an adorable exit that would have outfoxed 
Maya Plisetskaya as the long-suffering Odette. And so it went. 
</P>
<P>
 Adorably. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 One had to admire the inherent expressive restraint. No blown-up Disney kitsch 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 One had to admire the rigorous vigor of the stoic, essentially anonymous 
dancers, all of them hidden behind frozen-expression masks and weighed down 
with bulky costumes. One had to admire the deftness of the movement patterns 
and the whimsy of the expressive nuances. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a critical curmudgeon would not respond to the assorted charms of the 
storybook decors designed by Christine Edzard or to the cuddly anthropomorphic 
faces provided by Rostislav Doboujinsky. Everyone could applaud John 
Lanchbery's perky-pastiche score, which recycled theatrical tunes from various 
Victorian and Edwardian sources. Anthony Twiner and the Pacific Symphony made 
it all sound classy. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, one waited in vain for some narrative focus. One waited in vain for the 
flash of a unifying impulse. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Dowell reduced the tender tales of Potter and Ashton to an 
exercise in style, to an ambitious suite of period-piece contrivances. A little 
of that goes a long way. 
</P>
<P>
 The kiddies at the Saturday matinee fled in droves. Their impatience was 
exacerbated, no doubt, by the trial of an hourlong curtain-raiser, Ashton's 
"The Dream." 
</P>
<P>
 This poetic distillation of Shakespeare and Mendelssohn, anno 1964, remains a 
model of affectionate pathos and elegant wit. But, apart from the inspiration 
of Bottom's asinine hoofing en pointe, it doesn't offer much for the preteen 
crowd. The noisy little natives were restless. 
</P>
<P>
 The performances -- with one cast working in the afternoon and another in the 
evening -- were bright and undeniably high-spirited. They could have frustrated 
only the sentimental fossils in the crowd -- this one, for instance -- who 
can't forget the sly enchantment of Anthony Dowell as Oberon and Antoinette 
Sibley as Titania, not to mention the poignant bumbling of Alexander Grant as 
the rustic who temporarily becomes a donkey. 
</P>
<P>
 It should be admitted, however, that no one remembered from the golden age 
could match the nonchalant razzle-dazzle of Tetsuya Kumakawa, whose Puck flew 
faster than a speeding bullet at the matinee and, no doubt, could have leapt 
over high buildings in a single bound. By comparison, Peter Abegglen, his 
evening counterpart, was merely fleet, neat and competent. 
</P>
<P>
 The same three adjectives might describe the performances in general. The 
Royal "Dream" has certainly not become a nightmare; but it has lost much of its 
dramatic spark and precise edge. If we had wanted friendly, fuzzy 
approximations, we could have settled for the Joffrey version. 
</P>
<P>
 At the matinee, the dashing Jose Manuel Carreno struck macho poses and flashed 
blank smiles as Oberon -- no dangerous insinuation here. Leanne Benjamin was 
blandness personified as a Titania neither willful nor mercurial. 
</P>
<P>
 In the evening, the earnest William Trevitt served as another stock Oberon 
and, like his immediate predecessor, found the muted bravura something of a 
trial. Sarah Wildor, an incidental fairy at 3, became a sweetly wily mini-queen 
at 8 when she replaced the injured Lesley Collier. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, the climactic pas de deux wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Iain Webb and Luke Heydon served as competent, interchangeable Bottoms. 
Genesia Rosato, an exceptionally delirious Helena in the second cast, stood out 
among the foolish mortals. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendelssohn was deftly served in the pit by Barry Wordsworth and the Pacific 
Symphony. The children of the Pacific Chorale attended nicely to their ethereal 
chores, especially at night. Too bad their efforts were compromised by tinny 
amplification.

COUNTERPUNCH: ART AND ARCHITECTURE ARE NOT AT WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD E. OSTRIN, Ronald E. Ostrin is an attorney in Santa Monica and a 
member of the Culver City Arts Committee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a member of the Culver City Arts Committee, I read with much interest 
Christopher Knight's commentary on Culver City's City Council decision to 
consider under certain circumstances that the architectural design of a 
building itself might satisfy the percent-for-art requirement ("When Culver 
City Asks 'Is It Art?' It Misses the Point," Calendar, April 20). 
</P>
<P>
 The Arts Program is new in Culver City and is just getting started. A lot of 
the art that has been commissioned or purchased is awaiting installation after 
the ongoing Downtown Charette and City Hall building projects are finished. 
When these projects are completed some wonderful art is going to start 
sprouting in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of architecture in art was the subject of lengthy discussion on the 
Arts Committee, which advises the City Council. The issue was raised by 
developer Fred Smith who has built some wonderful projects in Culver City with 
a world-famous architect named Eric Owen Moss, who has been recognized both in 
the architecture and arts community for his innovative and creative work. Smith 
wished to avoid making an additional contribution for the Arts Program, because 
he felt he was hiring an artist to design his buildings. Most members of the 
Arts Committee, on the other hand, felt that letting the architect's work be 
the art contribution would open a Pandora's box of problems. The fear was that 
every architect, not just architects of Moss' caliber, would proclaim their 
work was art. 
</P>
<P>
 Defining art is nearly impossible, because art is an evolving concept. Art is 
really only a cultural dialogue that has been ongoing throughout history and 
which consistently changes. People first questioned whether Andy Warhol's 
paintings of soup cans were art. Today there is no question. 
</P>
<P>
 Architecture, if not art, is at least a cousin to art, because it is part of 
the cultural dialogue. When one looks at the work of architects such as Frank 
Lloyd Wright, Frank Gehry, or Eric Moss, one can only conclude that these 
people are doing more than just building, but are interested in substance, 
form, materials and shape, the basic subject matter of much of 20th-Century 
sculpture. The fact those shapes also carry a function may or may not 
disqualify it as art in some people's minds. 
</P>
<P>
 As a lawyer and the sole member of the committee who thought that an 
architect's work of Moss' caliber could be recognized as art, I thought we 
could promulgate guidelines that would define the artistic use of architecture, 
limiting it to work by a select few architects of unique artistic 
accomplishment and reputation and to construction of unusually significant 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
 I was, however, unable to win support for this position from the Arts 
Committee. For example, Dave Pastor, a very talented architect on the 
committee, argued that architecture was not art, and that if we allowed 
architects to qualify as artists for the project, we would be opening a 
Pandora's box that could gut the arts program. The Arts Committee members' 
arguments were so persuasive that I switched over and the committee's vote was 
unanimous that architects be disqualified as the artist for any project they 
worked on as architect. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council ignored our advice, partially due to a breakdown of 
communications with us (which has been recognized by both the council and the 
committee, and which shall be remedied). I believe the City Council wishes to 
go cautiously forward on a select case-by-case basis and does not intend to 
open the floodgates. 
</P>
<P>
 I am sure they are looking to the Arts Committee to propose strict guidelines, 
and I expect the guidelines to be very, very select. As always, acquiring art 
is an aesthetic act of selection, and if some of that art happens to be the 
buildings in Culver City, so be it. 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City's efforts should be applauded. Culver City is a small town trying 
to make a commitment to culture.  
</P>
<P>
 Although I think Knight had some very relevant comments, many of which I agree 
with, I think he was falling prey to hyperbole when he said, the next thing you 
know, Culver City will start deciding who is or is not a human being. Art and 
architecture are not at war, and I remember not too long ago when photography 
or ceramics were not considered art. The only problem and job we have is 
selecting the good from the bad. Art history is the final judge.

COUNTERPUNCH: 'THE NANNY' IS JEWISH AND PROUD OF IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRAN DRESCHER, Actress Fran Drescher is the creator and star of the CBS 
sitcom The Nanny. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm not quite sure why the Counterpunch article "Why Won't TV Show Jewish 
Couples" (Calendar, May 2) incorporated a vitriolic attack on "The Nanny." 
Since Judith Peiss felt the need to describe our writers as portraying Fran 
Fine "in the most negative ways," replete with "offensive stereotypes," 
however, I felt obligated to respond, if not for myself, then for those who 
have worked long and hard to ensure that Fran be a warm, caring, and wise 
character who clearly transcends any stereotypes, Jewish or otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Why waste time putting down a fellow "sister" such as Fran Fine -- someone who 
displays such a great capacity for love and wisdom and has such wholesome 
values and good instincts as a Jew, a woman and, above all, as a human being -- 
over something so petty and superficial as plastic slipcovers and the sound of 
her voice? 
</P>
<P>
 The truth of the matter is I created Fran Fine based very closely upon my 
mother, myself and all the wonderful and rich characters I grew up around in 
Flushing, Queens. I am sorry andsad if the way we really are (yes, plastic 
covers and all) offends Peiss, mainly because all her article accomplished was 
to reveal her own insecurities as a Jewish woman living in a WASP culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Peiss finds Fran Fine too blatantly Jewish for her taste. But Fran is 
openly proud of her heritage, and often incorporates Yiddish expressions in her 
dialogue. I find it infuriating to deal with negativity regarding a character 
who is clearly carving inroads for other Jewish characters -- particularly 
women -- who will not have to apologize for who or what they are. Maybe Peiss 
has been brainwashed -- by the very media she puts down -- into believing that 
the only good portrayal of a Jew is an assimilated one! 
</P>
<P>
 P.S. If Peiss has a Nielsen box, please disregard the above.

COUNTERPUNCH: WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO EQUAL ACCESS FOR ALL?

 " . . . Are you watching those uppity white folks again?"  
</P>
<P>
 -- Teen-age son on "South Central" 
</P>
<P>
 It seems contradictory that black sitcoms such as "South Central" repeatedly 
use racially disparaging language when at the same time black interest groups 
(such as the NAACP) continue to fight and march for racial equality. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Rosenberg wonders why there's so much public protest over "South 
Central," which he praised highly, while such shows as "Martin" and "Def Comedy 
Jam" often escape criticism. ("To Critics of 'South Central': What a Joke," 
Calendar, April 15.) 
</P>
<P>
 One important reason is that "South Central" is a family-oriented show that 
airs in prime time, unlike "Def Comedy Jam," which airs at midnight and is 
intended for an adult audience. Also, "Martin" and "Def Comedy Jam" rely 
heavily on outrageous humor, not attempts at realistic portrayals of our 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why, after several weeks of viewing, I find "South Central" the most 
disturbing of these shows. 
</P>
<P>
 If an African American bounced a check, used food stamps or said the "N" word 
on "Home Improvement," it would probably result in a racial protest. Yet when 
our own shows portray us this way, creators of such shows expect us to sit back 
and say amen. 
</P>
<P>
 No way! In times like these, we can't afford to be reticent. 
</P>
<P>
 I am old enough to remember when African Americans were a rarity on 
television. I grew up in the '60s and '70s, when most roles for African 
Americans were mainly stereotypical. Black interest groups fought to change 
that. Now today, it's intriguing that so many show creators (black and white) 
choose to retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 To say that "South Central" is stereotypical is an understatement. Any 
stereotypical image (new or old) is a concern when it conveys that African 
Americans (or any race of people) are unworthy. 
</P>
<P>
 What's wrong with "South Central"? No money. No job. No husband. Food stamps. 
Bad checks. Crude language. Drugs and gangs. The assertions that this show 
depicts reality is deliberate distortion. The view of reality that television 
transmits can be almost debilitating. The " . . . see, I told you so," attitude 
-- that's the way black people behave -- becomes inherent. 
</P>
<P>
 Whose problem is it anyway? Television executives cannot be responsible for 
the way one perceives another but they can surely do their part in breaking the 
chains of prejudice, which would directly and indirectly benefit all of us. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be fallacious to assume that African Americans are the only ones 
subjected to stereotyping. Undoubtedly no one is immune -- the old, the young, 
Asians, Latinos, blondes, males, females, the rich, poor, fat and skinny. 
</P>
<P>
 There's not a thing wrong with comedy. We can all use a good laugh. However, I 
see nothing funny about open antagonism, fiery rhetoric and black shame on any 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 On "South Central," in particular, the irony and sarcasm is routinely 
debasing. "Why not just carry a sign: 'I'm young, I'm black, I'm stupid, shoot 
me,' " the mother teases her son. And also, the satire on this show, in my 
opinion, is waaay too contemptuous. 
</P>
<P>
 African Americans have such a diversity of gifts and our talents are 
multifarious. It's a sad commentary to see such energy wasted on portraying 
negative images instead of the betterment and uplifting of our society. 
</P>
<P>
 "South Central," why not "Rebuild L.A.?"

MUSIC REVIEW; PHILIP GLASS PLAYS PHILIP GLASS AT RECITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Philip Glass is the Richard Nixon of music. Either one appreciates the potent 
and subtle simplicity of Glass' music, or one hears it as the Kansas of the 
ear: flat and treeless and stretching endlessly into nowhere.Indifference is 
not a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the patrons at Wadsworth Theater in Westwood Saturday night obviously 
wandered into this event -- a piano recital of his own music by the 57-year-old 
Baltimore-born composer -- by accident. When intermission fell, exactly 40 
minutes after the concert had begun, they were gone, without rudeness 
disappearing into the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyal followers of Glass had to be delighted at what they heard in both halves 
of this program, a pleasant mix of familiar solo pieces and new arrangements of 
more or less recent music. 
</P>
<P>
 This composer is no raving virtuoso, but he has the chops to play his own 
music -- much of it of Schubertian difficulty -- clearly and acceptably, with 
no apologies necessary. To put him in context: Glass plays Glass more easily 
than, say, Debussy (as heard on player-piano reconstructions) played Debussy. 
</P>
<P>
 This varied Glass agenda covered ground from 1976 to the present, opening with 
the signature "Opening" and closing with the near-benediction of a very brief 
excerpt from the opera "Satyagraha." 
</P>
<P>
 In between, the highlights were three difficult etudes taken from "What's So 
Funny?" and "Mad Rush" (given its title by choreographer Lucinda Childs), plus 
"Five Metamorphoses." Those who find Glass' music important as living art, and 
as part of the French/American mainstream, will find all these pieces 
important, too. Those who don't will not be persuaded. DANIEL CARIAGA

MUSIC REVIEW; KRONOS QUARTET'S 10-PIECE WESTWOOD PROGRAM FASCINATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Good music is a comfort, but a mundane one, like a beautiful carpet or a cozy 
chair. Great music disturbs, then uplifts, taking the listener to a spiritual 
plane where comfort is irrelevant.The Kronos Quartet, ever searching for 
important new works in a world of pleasing but ordinary ones, reminded us of 
these truisms Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The ensemble, playing in the commodious sanctuary at Westwood United Methodist 
Church, brought an overgenerous program of 10 pieces, eight of them in premiere 
performances, and found gold in three: Sofia Gubaidulina's Quartet No. 4 and 
two instrumental/vocal works by Arvo Part, his "Cantate Domino" and "Missa 
Syllabica." 
</P>
<P>
 These are haunting works that resonate in the ear and mind after one hears 
them, works of layered activity and meaning, of transparent soundscape, of 
apprehendable rhetoric. They engage the listener, then keep his attention, 
becoming both balm and provocation. 
</P>
<P>
 With added lighting effects, the Kronos players -- David Harrington and John 
Sherba on violin, Hank Dutt on viola, Joan Jeanrenaud on cello -- highlighted 
the Russian composer's brief but content-dense work in a deeply probing 
performance. In Part's near-mystical essays, meshing of the vocal quartet 
Theatre of Voices with the strings proved effortless, but, for the listener, 
emotionally gripping. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally polished in execution -- the Kronos seems to be in peak form these 
days -- recent pieces by Brent Michael Davids, Steven Mackey and Lois V. Vierk, 
affectionate revivals of historical miniatures by the American jazzist Raymond 
Scott (who died this year) and the world premiere of a Middle-Eastern suite by 
Lebanese composer Ali Jihad Racy, made up the rest of this program, presented 
by the UCLA Center for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 In his own piece, Racy joined the quartet, playing both flute and lute, 
assisted by percussionist Souhael Kaspar.

JAZZ REVIEW; IRVINE FEST LIVES UP TO PROMISE BUT FAILS TO STIR CROWD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 It was sometime during drummer Ralph Penland's midafternoon performance of 
Herbie Hancock's blustery "Eye of the Hurricane" when the sun broke through the 
clouds to shine on the Southern California Jazz Festival. It was a nicely 
ironic touch for Saturday's edition of the fest, held on two stages between 
high-rises and the San Diego Freeway on the grounds of the Koll Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, the weather situation had been touch and go. Friday's opening 
installment of the three-day event ended prematurely under an early evening 
downpour. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, despite further threats of rain after the sun went down Saturday, the 
festival's first complete day kept its musical promise. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the overall lineup weighed in heavily on the side of beat-driven, 
contemporary sounds, the day's schedule provided enough contrast to interest 
even the most jaded listeners. Mixed in with the synthesizer wash, booming bass 
and the whine of electric guitars were mainstream jazz combos, a New 
Orleans-styled piano professor and a cabaret vocalist.  
</P>
<P>
 If that wasn't enough, one could always wander away from the stages to peruse 
the wares of arts and craft dealers as well as sample foods from 17 area 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the bands was able to stir the crowd, estimated by this reviewer at no 
more than 2,000 during its peak, into a dance-party frenzy as seems to happen 
at least once each day at the annual Playboy Festival held in the Hollywood 
Bowl. Maybe fans were too comfortable wrapped in blankets and ensconced on 
their lawn chairs to get up and boogie. But there were a number of musical 
highlights. 
</P>
<P>
 The day's most entertaining set came from A. J. Croce, the 22-year-old son of 
the late singer-songwriter Jim Croce. 
</P>
<P>
 Seated at the grand piano, Croce has the good, slick-backed looks of Harry 
Connick Jr., but, unlike Connick, his musical view looks to low, rather than 
high, society. Backed by a three-piece horn section, guitar bass and drums, 
Croce spun tales, sang the blues and played rollicking, barrel-house-styled 
piano. 
</P>
<P>
 He preluded almost all of his numbers with a clever story tagged with the 
line, "and it feels something like this."  
</P>
<P>
 The most amazing thing about Croce is his voice, a gruff, serious instrument 
that sounds as if it might come from someone much older. His well-paced 
delivery on the seasoned standard "Trouble in Mind" reflected more dues paying 
than someone of his 22 years has probably seen. 
</P>
<P>
 At the piano, Croce is a blend of Art Tatum and Jerry Lee Lewis mixing 
jazz-inspired lines with trills and glissandi. 
</P>
<P>
 Closing act Richard Elliot got down on his knees to play his tenor sax. The 
former Tower of Power horn section man applied strong R & B chops to his 
beat-minded selections, playing aggressively with a bit of raunch here and 
there, or working with warmth and intimacy as he did on "I'm Not in Love." 
</P>
<P>
 The festival ran close to schedule, falling 15 to 30 minutes behind as the 
evening wore on. Sound from the main stage, despite the white noise generated 
by the freeway, was passable if not perfect. But sound from the second stage 
was uneven, marred by bad balance and variations in volume. Though the weather 
held down attendance, this is an event that deserves a repeat performance in 
front of larger audiences next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival's Sunday schedule, which ran too late for this review, included 
Keiko Matsui, John Patitucci and Patrice Rushen and Ndugu Chancler.

DANCE REVIEW; MEHMET SANDER TROUPE DEFIES GRAVITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Choreographer Mehmet Sander continued his disturbing explorations of 
physically demanding movement-tasks within a confined environment in 
"Controlled Space/Infinite Space," which received its premiere Friday at 
Schoenberg Hall, UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 The laboratory or "controlled" space, in this case, was an open cube tilted at 
a 45-degree angle so that it rested on one of its edges. The two sides 
extending up from the bottom were made of solid wood; the other two sides were 
defined by parallel open bars, somewhat like a jungle gym. 
</P>
<P>
 At the start, the six members of the company -- Sander, Lucianne Aquino, Scott 
Abraham, Leanne Lacazotte, Alan Panovich and Diane Takamine -- bounded through 
the cube in individual ways, some hurtling themselves hard against the sides as 
they did so. 
</P>
<P>
 In rigorously defined sequences, however, they soon responded with 
militaristic obedience to each other's instructions, sometimes calling 
themselves merely "A," "B," "C" and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 They piled up in crunches at the bottom of the cube. They slammed against the 
walls. They crashed into each other, eliciting gasps from the audience, 
especially as the sound of bodies smacking bodies was amplified. But even 
without that, the observer's nervous system was likely to register the impact 
and the risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Sander has said that his dances are not dangerous if a proper mind-over-body 
concentration is achieved. For at least one person, however, that conclusion 
seems debatable and unproved, especially as to any long-term consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the work ended in an image of precariously stable accommodation, 
even triumph, over gravity and confinement as the dancers balanced along the 
outside angles of the cube. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all the five other (previously reviewed) pieces on the program ended in 
a similarly liberating, if transitory, image. Sander has also reworked his last 
year's less aggressive "Pole." After a series of shared gymnastic tasks, 
Panovich balanced on the end of an aluminum pole rotated slowly by Sander and 
Aquino. It was a surprisingly lyrical close. CHRIS PASLES

POP MUSIC REVIEW; HERSH BALANCES HER DARK, LIGHT SIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether edgy and electric with her band, Throwing Muses, or quietly intimate 
on her recent acoustic solo debut, Kristin Hersh never has been less than 
intense while plugging into the emotional currents that flow through troubled 
homes and tormented minds. 
</P>
<P>
 But the prospect of Hersh playing solo and acoustic, as she did on Friday at 
the Coach House, seemed a little daunting.Given her heavy subject matter and 
the fact that her symbolic, fragmentary lyrics typically render literal 
meanings obscure, an evening of unadorned Hersh songs held great potential for 
claustrophobia. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, Hersh the singer-guitarist was as darkly vivid as ever, but 
Hersh the hostess proved to be a spontaneous and richly comic raconteur who 
gave the show the lighter dimension it needed to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 She spun imaginative tall tales, made wry observations about life in the music 
business, and thoroughly charmed her fans with warm, funny stories about her 
toddler son that struck a perfect balance between doting affection and crusty 
humor. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, Hersh took advantage of the intimate format to open up in a direct, 
disarming way that gave her performance an entirely new dimension. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hersh plays tonight at 8:30 at the Roxy, 9009 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood, 
$16.50. (310) 276-2222. MIKE BOEHM

POP MUSIC REVIEW; KMFDM STRIKES A JACKHAMMER NOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The German industrial band KMFDM has been making synthesized rock for more 
than 10 years, and it's considered influential and high-ranking in a genre 
dominated by Nine Inch Nails and Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 On its albums the group mixes hard-core thrash and occasionally danceable 
beats with driving guitar.But at Glam Slam on Saturday, KMFDM sounded like 
Judas Priest backed by a jackhammer. The repetitive songs quickly lost depth, 
and the show didn't feel much different from amped, '80s-style metal. 
</P>
<P>
 KMFDM played its anthemic numbers on two to three live guitars, bass and a 
drum pad, with a few sampled voices in German and English tucked inside the 
thumping mix. 
</P>
<P>
 Six-foot-plus skinhead singer Sascha Konietzko wore a polka-dot miniskirt, 
purple satin blouse, snagged tights and combat boots, and he swayed his big 
hips slowly and off the beat while growling in deep, sinister tones. He was 
occasionally accompanied by sampled chants of what sounded like football 
crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 KMFDM smothered its creativity in a sea of generic riffs, catering to 
fist-pumpers like Wayne and Garth rather than an adventure-seeking audience.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; RICKIE LEE JONES SCORES WITH A RETURN TO THE BASICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There may be a lesson here. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when there is so much obsession with technology in pop music, two of 
our most valued artists have found new levels of character and depth in their 
own work by returning to basics. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Cash comes closer than he has in 20 years to capturing the essence of 
his soul-stirring music in his new "American Recordings" album, which simply 
features his voice and guitar recorded in a producer's living room. 
</P>
<P>
 And Rickie Lee Jones exhibited an intimacy and grace on Friday at the 
Wadsworth Theater in a solo acoustic concert that was so enthralling you felt 
at times you were hearing her music and message for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing couldn't have been better for Jones, whose attire (a flannel shirt 
over a red sun dress) was as informal as the staging. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite continued critical support, Jones hasn't been a major pop chart 
contender for years -- and the danger is that many potential fans could begin 
to dismiss her as a narrow cult artist whose best days are behind her. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's concert -- part of a heralded U.S. tour -- ridiculed that contention. 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, Jones is a more confident and complete artist now than in the 
late '70s, when she arrived on the scene with a series of dazzling tunes whose 
poetic imagination and streetwise swagger led to comparisons with everyone from 
Joni Mitchell to Tom Waits. 
</P>
<P>
 That early material, including "Chuck E.'s in Love" and "Last Chance Texaco," 
was in generous supply at the Wadsworth, where Jones alternated between piano 
and guitar. But the new arrangements downplayed many of the exotic blues and 
jazz textures that once competed with the words for your attention. 
</P>
<P>
 In stripping the songs down, Jones used her voice, which can move effortlessly 
from shades of sweet innocence to numbing heartache, to find fresh, revealing 
edges in the tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the emphasis on the early material, however, the songs that most 
defined the comforting tone of Friday's concert were "Running From Mercy" and 
"Stewart's Coat," both from Jones' latest album, 1993's "Traffic From 
Paradise." 
</P>
<P>
 "Love is a healing thing," she sang in "Coat" with a voice so wistful that the 
song sounded like the prayer of someone who can testify to the line's truth, 
yet has been touched enough by sadness to never lose track of love's wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 In a pop world where many of our most gripping singer-songwriters help 
illuminate moments of darkness and doubt, Jones' commanding performance 
demonstrated why more than ever she is one of our most inspiring beacons.

ART REVIEWS; JENNIFER PASTOR TAKES CLASSICAL COMMAND OF SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KANDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A single sculpture by Jennifer Pastor commands the space at Richard Telles 
Fine Art with sober authority. 
</P>
<P>
 One could argue that sober and authority are odd words to use in relation to a 
work whose kitsch potential hovers at a stratospheric level. Could anyone 
immune to kitsch have possibly imagined five plastic Christmas trees in 
assorted hues, each ringed with color-coordinated tinsel and crowned with a 
massive, Busby Berkeley-style headdress, radiating outward like the rays of a 
Technicolor sun? 
</P>
<P>
 The conceptual heat is mitigated by the cool of the piece's ersatz, aquatic 
element -- a fiberglass vision of madly splashing, bubbling, foaming water. The 
whole is like something one might encounter in an alternate universe, where the 
denizens of "Star Wars" link arms with the Man From Atlantis and do the cancan 
in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. On a sunny May morning, on the border of 
Hollywood, the psychic and seasonal dislocations alone are enough to inspire 
vertigo. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, Pastor is not interested in the dizzying wonders of kitsch. Nor does 
she offer a sanctimonious essay on our undying taste for artificiality, 
sentimentality and excess. Her work is far too restrained for either scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it is concerned with traditional sculptural issues of mass and 
volume. She achieves harmonies of form and color that are (perhaps 
unfathomably) classical. At a moment when culture has so overtaken nature that 
the latter exists only as a vague, ancestral memory, Pastor doesn't so much 
rescue debased materials as re-imagine beauty.

 Suspended Belief: In Rod Baer's mixed-media installation at Pasadena's Armory 
Center, logic and gravity are temporarily suspended. A rusted steel chalkboard 
is inexplicably mounted at a 90-degree angle to the wall. A mannequin spins in 
circles, like the impatient hands of a dysfunctional clock. A night table with 
impossibly long legs reaches for heaven, an inorganic variant on Jack's 
beanstalk. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the ceiling's rafters, high above eye level, an entire television room 
-- complete with easy chair, lamp and half-eaten pizza -- is sandwiched beneath 
its virtual double, a mirror reflection that purports to tell only half the 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 The title, "The Floating World," is a conceit familiar from Buddhist thought, 
referring to that which is fleeting in life, to a realm where nature and 
spirituality are one. Baer is likewise interested in a conjoined realm, in 
which the art object and the artist are one, floating in philosophical ether, 
tethered only by the imagination's constraints. 
</P>
<P>
 Baer's wholly romantic conception dares us to be dazzled by its refusal of 
limits. Yet, despite "The Floating World's" admirable mix of static and 
kinetic, silent and acoustic, inert and living, nothing here defies 
expectation. Nothing is truly uncanny, except, perhaps, Baer's rejection of the 
kind of irony that might have saved the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Romanticism is one thing, and tricky in any case, but the rigidly enforced 
poetics that dominate this installation eventually grate on the nerves. Instead 
of freeing our minds, the work presses its agenda, reminding us that even when 
it masquerades as poetry, didacticism is no fun at all.

 Stain Painting: In a single blow, Didi Dunphy makes gorgeous tie-dye fabrics 
and gives Helen Frankenthaler and Morris Louis a run for their money. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the difference, anyway, between the narcotic pleasures of the 1960s 
craft par excellence and the snoozy palatability of Colorfield stain painting? 
Nothing much -- besides status, dollar value and museum validation. 
</P>
<P>
 The same could be said for the differences between Colonial quilt making and 
so-called "systemic abstraction," yet another brand of 1960s formalism. 
Dunphy's deadpan quilt paintings, patched together from hundreds of tiny 
squares and triangles of painted canvas, suggest that the same, 
obsessive-compulsive impulse lies behind the cozy, "feminine" craft and the 
coolly intellectual, "masculine" art. 
</P>
<P>
 These large-scale works at A/B Gallery are intricately laced with 
pupil-popping color and sharply honed irony. But to consider them solely within 
the context of postmodern critique, parody or subversion is to miss the point. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunphy's paintings are merely dressed up for the occasion as flippant, knowing 
gestures. Like artist Jim Isermann, she has undertaken a labor of love, a plea 
for beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the stakes are entirely different. The myriad seductions of beauty, 
tangled up with questions of respect and respectability, are particularly 
problematic for women in this culture. Dunphy's answer is to take herself and 
those seductions very seriously and to entice us into doing the same.

TV REVIEW; 'HEART OF A CHILD' IS A DRAINING ORDEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The final 10 minutes or so of "Heart of a Child" deliver a measure of 
emotional catharsis that is hard to resist. But it's such a grueling chore 
getting to that point that the story's sure-fire conclusion is much flatter 
than it should be. 
</P>
<P>
 The narrative idea behind this fact-based ordeal centers on two pregnant women 
(Ann Jillian and Michele Greene) who, through a controversial infant transplant 
operation, create one healthy baby out of two babies who would otherwise have 
died. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bleak direction by Sandor Stern and the tortured teleplay by Susan 
Nanus give the cast little to do except wring their hands. The travail is 
merely monotonous. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that there's much cause for cheer: The mothers' unborn babies will not 
last the night, one an anencephalic infant with an undeveloped brain and the 
other suffering from a terminally defective heart. 
</P>
<P>
 As the mournful, angry women and their helpless husbands (Terry O'Quinn and 
Bruce Greenwood) anguish over their plight, one of the couples decides that its 
baby's heart should be used to save the life of the other baby. By this time 
the viewer is so drained it's hard to get excited. 
</P>
<P>
 Rip Torn, who normally lights up any screen, meets his Waterloo here and 
phones in his throwaway role as the controversial Dr. Leonard Bailey, who 
successfully performed medical history's youngest transplant surgery at the 
Loma Linda University Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike the surgery, this whole production is uninspired. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Heart of a Child" airs at 9 tonight on NBC (Channels 4, 36 and 39).

ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH / A SPECIAL REPORT: RESTAURANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 RISKY BUSINESS: In booming 1979, a restaurant was opening in Orange County 
every 34 hours, but in recession-ridden 1993, the pace had slowed to about one 
every third day. . . . Usually, 85% fail within two years, but casualties may 
be greater for the new crop, says an industry expert. Nowadays, half the 
county's restaurants are said to be struggling with profits of 2.5% or less. 
</P>
<P>
 FANTASYLAND: The tide in the county's restaurant business is definitely 
running against Mom and Pop, says restaurant consultant Rudy Miick. There may 
still be room for the small, family-run restaurant, but start-up costs are 
getting beyond reach -- $100,000 for just a lunch counter, about $700,000 for a 
bare-bones coffee shop. . . . And remember, it is a business, Miick warns. 
"Cooking for 10 friends is a warm, fuzzy feeling, but running a restaurant is 
not a lot different than running a shoe factory." 
</P>
<P>
 HELPING HAND: Times are tough, so any help is welcome. Take El Adobe in San 
Juan Capistrano, where President Richard Nixon liked to eat when he lived in 
San Clemente. Since Nixon's death put him back on Page One, locals and tourists 
are ordering El Adobe's El Presidente plate and requesting the chair in which 
he sat. . . . That's fine with Richard J. O'Neill, owner of El Adobe, who also 
happens to be one of the county's most prominent Democrats: "I spent my life 
campaigning against that guy, and now he's helping my business. I'm revising my 
opinion. He's a great American." 
</P>
<P>
 TROUBLE AHEAD: Orange County likes its food fast. In 1992, the year with the 
latest tally, local fast-food restaurants sold $889 million worth of Big Macs, 
Whoppers and what-have-yous. Yet the future is threatening for these 
franchises, says James Doti, economist and president of Chapman University. The 
15- to 34-year-old population, which buys the most fast food, will decrease in 
Orange County by 6% over the next four years and probably continue shrinking, 
Doti says. "The industry is in for some stress very soon." Eating Out 
</P>
<P>
 Through economic booms and recessions alike, the number of restaurants in the 
county has steadily increased. 1994: 7,065

MICHIGAN'S MEDICAL SOCIETY SIDESTEPS DEBATE ON ASSISTED SUICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Medical Society reaffirmed without debate Sunday its opposition to 
doctor-assisted suicide in most cases, angering some members who wanted to air 
their differences. 
</P>
<P>
 With Michigan's own Jack Kevorkian at the center of a national debate, leaders 
of the 11,700-member group expected more of a battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm extremely upset. Through our inaction we're allowing Kevorkian to 
dominate the debate," said Dr. Louis Zako, a delegate. Kevorkian was acquitted 
last week of violating a state law that bans assisted suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Medical Society's reaffirmed policy, a physician is allowed to help 
a patient to commit suicide only after all other options are exhausted. The 
delegates voted 85 to 32 to reaffirm the policy.

JOE LAYTON; CHOREOGRAPHER, DIRECTOR FOR STAGE, TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe Layton, dancer, choreographer, director and producer who won Tony awards 
for Broadway hits "No Strings" and "George M!" and an Emmy for the first of his 
four Barbra Streisand television specials, has died. He was 64. 
</P>
<P>
 Layton, who also worked on the closing ceremonies for the 1984 Olympics in Los 
Angeles, died Thursday at a hospital in Key West, Fla., after an extended 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
 The peripatetic "stager," as he liked to be called, created not only for the 
musical stage and television, but also for concerts and film. 
</P>
<P>
 He showcased such concert stars as Julio Iglesias, Joel Grey, Raquel Welch, 
Lionel Richie, Kenny Rogers, Vic Damone and Ann-Margret. On film, he staged the 
flapper-era dances for the 1967 "Thoroughly Modern Millie" and Bette Midler's 
war-era antics for the 1991 "For the Boys." He also served as executive 
producer for "Annie" in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his four specials for Streisand beginning with the Emmy-winner 
"My Name Is Barbra" in 1965, Layton created television shows for Cher, the 
Carpenters, Diana Ross, Olivia Newton-John, Carol Burnett, Dolly Parton and 
Willie Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at the person who's to star in the show and try to see what it is he 
needs, then use my imagination to provide whatever it is," Layton told The 
Times in 1966. "I also like to tell a story, not with a lot of dialogue, but 
visually. After all, TV is a visual medium, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
 He was also known for creating large-scale productions such as the Lionel 
Richie portion of the closing ceremonies for the 1984 Olympics and President 
Clinton's inaugural concert at the Lincoln Memorial in 1993. Los Angeles 
audiences also saw his work in fund-raisers for AIDS Project Los Angeles such 
as the 1985 "Commitment to Life I" honoring Elizabeth Taylor and Betty Ford and 
the 1991 "Commitment to Life V" honoring Midler. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Layton had served as creative director of the entertainment 
division of Radio City Music Hall Productions and had staged the currently 
touring Rockettes show with Susan Anton. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Joseph Lichtman in Brooklyn, Layton was graduated from New York's School 
of Music and Art in 1948. He made his Broadway debut as a dancer in "Oklahoma!" 
in 1947, and danced in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" in 1949 and "Wonderful Town" 
in 1953. After serving in the Army in the early 1950s, he danced with a French 
ballet company for six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Layton moved into choreography in the late 1950s and earned his first 
significant recognition for "Once Upon a Mattress" in 1959, the show that 
propelled Carol Burnett to fame. The same year he choreographed "Sound of 
Music" for Mary Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 He earned his Tonys for the dances in "No Strings" in 1962 and "George M!" in 
1969. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1970, Layton had moved into directing, with "Scarlet" at London's 
prestigious Drury Lane Theatre and "Two by Two" on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his love of North Carolina's outer islands, Layton rewrote and for 
two decades directed the outdoor historic play "The Lost Colony" in Manteo, 
N.C., where private memorial services will be conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 A public memorial will be scheduled for July in New York, and a Joe Layton 
Arts Scholarship Fund is being established. 
</P>
<P>
 Layton is survived by his son, Jeb James Layton.

STREET SMART: ANY SIZE MOTORCYCLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO TRIGGER LEFT-TURN ARROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I've got two questions for you. First, I've noticed at the intersection of 
Jamboree Road and Canyon View Avenue in the city of Orange that when I'm on my 
motorcycle, I can't trigger the left-turn arrow.  
</P>
<P>
 I've had this happen at other intersections also. Is there a certain weight 
these triggering devices are set to? If so, why are they set so that a 
motorcycle can't trigger it? 
</P>
<P>
 My second question concerns the crosswalk at the Kaiser Foundation Hospital in 
Anaheim on North Lakeview Avenue just north of Riverdale Avenue. Are there any 
plans to put a walkover bridge in that area? 
</P>
<P>
 With that crosswalk as it stands now, it not only causes a backup of traffic 
during the peak hours, it also seems to be a risk to the people trying to get 
to the hospital from the parking lot across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich Koester 
</P>
<P>
 Orange 
</P>
<P>
 The left-turn pockets of all Orange intersections are equipped with sensor 
loops that should detect the presence of even the smallest motorcycle, said 
Dennis Schmitz, senior traffic operations engineer for the city of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 A sensor loop, a coiled wire embedded in the street, picks up on the size of a 
vehicle rather than the weight. The way you are positioning your motorcycle in 
the left-turn lane may have something to do with why the light won't activate, 
Schmitz said. If you situate your motorcycle directly over the sensor loop, or 
if you pull your motorcycle up to the limit line in the middle of the lane, the 
left arrow should activate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless a street has been repaved, you can see the cuts in the pavement where 
the sensor loop lies.  
</P>
<P>
 If you have done all this, and you are still not getting results, Schmitz 
suggests that you contact him at Orange's traffic engineering department at 
(714) 532-6427. He or one of his staff would be glad to go with you to the 
intersection to see if you need to do anything more or if the sensor is not 
working. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding your second question, there were plans to build a pedestrian bridge 
linking Kaiser Foundation Hospital to the parking structure, said Donna Donan, 
director of public affairs for Kaiser Permanente. The bridge is part of a 
planned expansion of the whole hospital campus, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But all of the plans are on hold indefinitely, Donan said, because the 
hospital's income has fallen below expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 How about a word for bicycle commuters? The southbound West Coast Highway in 
Newport Beach between Tustin Avenue and Dover Drive has just been squeezed into 
two lanes adjacent to the curbing due to construction. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no bicycle lane! There is fast auto traffic here. This construction 
project has been a nightmare for auto traffic, also, for the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
 I understand the city of Newport Beach is doing this project?  
</P>
<P>
 Hugo V. Schmidt 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Because it is a state highway, Caltrans is responsible for the construction on 
Coast Highway. And relief is almost in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Work should be completed by the first week in June, said Caltrans spokeswoman 
Rose Orem. There will be a bicycle lane when the project is all paved, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I was traveling west on MacArthur Boulevard in Irvine, in the early evening, 
crossing over the San Diego (405) Freeway to access the on-ramp heading south. 
When the green arrow indicator flashed, I proceeded on to what I perceived was 
the south on-ramp only to find myself almost into the off-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 The "wrong way" sign was not at the very corner of this exit route. 
</P>
<P>
 Since both routes are next to each other, it would prevent this from happening 
if "wrong way" signs were placed clearly facing traffic at this exit point. 
Placing green "enter" signs at the entrance of the south access ramp would also 
avoid any costly error. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Levine 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans sees no reason to change the existing signs, said Rose Orem of 
Caltrans.  
</P>
<P>
 There is a sign alerting drivers to the upcoming southbound freeway on-ramp 
and there is a "Do Not Enter" sign at the end of the off-ramp, she said. That 
is Caltrans' standard sign placement of signs when an on-ramp and an off-ramp 
are next to each other, as they are on MacArthur, Orem said. Additional signs 
will not be erected because too many signs can distract the motorist, she said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 A project to widen MacArthur Boulevard is under design. The project will add a 
bridge over the San Diego Freeway to accommodate westbound traffic on MacArthur 
and widen the southbound MacArthur on-ramp, she said. All signing such as "DO 
NOT ENTER" signs at this location will be emphasized, she added.

NEW GUN-SURRENDER PROGRAM ALLOWS ANONYMITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A monthlong plan allowing gun owners to turn in firearms at any sheriff's 
station with no questions asked -- and without revealing their identities -- 
began Sunday, and reports were that several weapons, including two handguns, 
had been voluntarily surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Sherman Block and Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina, who are 
co-sponsoring the program, said all weapons received will be melted down. 
</P>
<P>
 A Sheriff's Department spokesman said that by early Sunday afternoon, three 
stations -- Lakewood, Industry and West Hollywood -- had reported receiving 
weapons. The Sheriff's Department has long accepted guns for disposal, but 
customarily asked the owner's name. By allowing anonymity, the hope is that 
more firearms will be surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
 Those wishing to participate in the program are asked to call the sheriff's 
station where they plan to go and inform deputies that they are going to turn 
in a gun. The weapon should be unloaded and locked in the owner's trunk. At the 
station, gun owners are asked to let deputies retrieve the weapon rather than 
bringing it inside themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone unable to unload the bullets from a weapon should call the sheriff's 
office. A deputy will be sent to pick it up. The program lasts through June 8.

VALLEY CHRONICLE: RATHER THAN PAY ARTS ASSESSMENT, CARWASH OWNER PUTS ARTIST TO 
WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some might just say that David Israel beat City Hall. If nothing else, he says 
it was a small but meaningful victory. 
</P>
<P>
 It started when Israel was told that, in addition to the almost $1 million he 
says he and his investors put into his new '50s carwash and diner scheduled to 
open June 1 in Northridge, he would have to pay an additional $6,000 for an 
arts assessment fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Israel had never heard of such an animal, he found out that it was a 
measure first proposed by Councilman Joel Wachs to help beautify Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance, passed in March, 1991 and made retroactive to Jan. 15, 1989, 
says that commercial and industrial projects of more than $500,000 in value 
will be assessed about 1% of that value to provide art and culture for the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel thought about that $6,000, and then asked the folks at Building and 
Safety, "If I have a mural painted on the building for that exact amount, can I 
be reimbursed for the money?" 
</P>
<P>
 He received approval, which is how he came to engage ex-gang member and tagger 
Albert Lares to execute the 1,430-square-foot painting that now graces the 
tunnel wall of the Cruisers Car Wash & Diner. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Israel and the city seem happy with the results. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Susan Foley Johannsen, director of the arts development fee, 
which approves arts projects, a project developer must pay the fee by one of 
two ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can pay the money into a trust fund for future use in the community, or 
may propose an art project or cultural program to be used in the development's 
vicinity." 
</P>
<P>
 Greig Smith, an aide to Councilman Hal Bernson, whose district includes 
Northridge, estimates that the fund raises about $10 million a year that he 
thinks might be better used for other, more pressing needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Johannsen has another view. She thinks that the fee helps to enrich the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are 152 known languages and dialects in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District. The arts are the only language understood by everyone," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's so wonderful about David's mural is that it reaches out to the 
community, and shows a happy lifestyle, something that's needed in a place like 
Northridge, where the residents have been through so much trauma recently," she 
adds. 
</P>
<P>
 The $6,000 mural depicts what Israel calls the "Happy Days" lifestyle of 
Southern California during the 1950s, something the 28-year-old native of 
Aspen, Colo., is too young to have known. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel says he encourages others to follow his path of doing their own arts 
projects on building sites and not let the money disappear into the city trust 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was put through hoops to get approval for his carwash and diner, 
but getting to use the arts money the way he wants will make up for a lot. 
Writer Taking Humorous Look at Stories of the Bible 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman Oaks resident David Evans is hoping that he's not the only person who 
can find humor in the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
 He started out as a kid born in Chicago who grew up in Kansas, moving to 
California to court fame and fortune by putting together words that came out of 
other people's mouths. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a writer for Bullwinkle's Jay Ward, and for Bill Cosby. He wrote words 
for "The Monkees" television show. 
</P>
<P>
 But about 10 years ago, he says, he got burned out on television comedy 
writing and went into the emerging world of business comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty generally accepted that it's easier to make a point if the point 
is presented in a humorous context," says Evans, "so businesses now hire me 
when they have a point to make." 
</P>
<P>
 He says he recently completed, with the help of an animator, a booklet for the 
Cerritos Water District telling people all they wanted to know about water 
issues in their area. 
</P>
<P>
 Well and good, making jokes about water. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans' latest efforts are two books he has done for his own, and he hopes, 
everyone else's amusement. They are called "The Good Book of New Testament 
Cartoons" and "The Good Book of Old Testament Cartoons." He doesn't expect them 
to invoke the wrath of the Almighty, but the general populace may be something 
else. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think many people approach the Bible in a joyless, grim and strident 
manner, when actually it's full of funny stories about people in biblical 
times. And since we are created in His image, we should realize He has a sense 
of humor too," Evans says. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening drawing in the Old Testament book shows Adam on the first day of 
creation looking around the Garden of Eden and saying, "Well, so far, so good." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the cartoons in the New Testament book shows Christ during the highly 
publicized miracle of the loaves and fishes, with some guy at the back of the 
crowd saying, "He forgot the tartar sauce." 
</P>
<P>
 Evans says one of the project's biggest boosters is his father, a retired 
Presbyterian minister who always thought people should approach religion with 
joy in their hearts.

 Now Evans hopes to perform his own little miracle by trying to publish and 
distribute the books himself. Hospital Fair Will Feature Heart Made of Play Doh 
</P>
<P>
 One of the attractions at the Heart Fair on May 14 at Holy Cross Hospital in 
Mission Hills will be a lot of chicken wire and Play Doh. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the hospital's Marilyn Haese, an 8-foot-high heart made of wire 
will be placed in the parking lot during the event, and those attending will be 
encouraged to fill it up with red Play Doh. "It should be fun for adults and 
children, and will be a symbol of our first Heart Fair," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 She adds that the people at Play Doh in Rhode Island, who have donated the 
material, say it will be the largest structure ever created with their product. 
After the fair, the material will be sent to the Los Angeles Children's Museum 
for use by youngsters visiting there. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be lots of information about how to be nice to one's heart at the 
Heart Fair, as well as a series of health tests provided free. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital chef Dave Carino will be making fat-free red, black and white pasta 
for the health-conscious and hungry. He plans on whipping up about 200 pounds 
of the stuff for the estimated 1,000 attendees. Overheard: 
</P>
<P>
 "I suggested to my wife that I make her a mother for Mother's Day. She said 
fine, as long as I would carry the kid, give birth and raise it until it was 
21. I don't think she was kidding. You can't say anything to women anymore 
without them copping an attitude."

CHAVEZ REGAINS CROWN IN A BIZARRE TWIST; SATURDAY'S FIGHTS: HE DEFEATS RANDALL 
BY TECHNICAL SPLIT-DECISION AFTER HEAD BUTT OPENS A GASH IN THE EIGHTH ROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It wasn't revenge, it wasn't anything close. 
</P>
<P>
 Julio Cesar Chavez got back his title in as bizarre a circumstance as could 
have been imagined Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez and Frankie Randall were getting into the heart of their bout, then 
they had to stop. Then everybody had to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the MGM Grand Garden crowd of about 14,000, almost completely pro-Chavez, 
expressed relief and bizarre merriment when Chavez was announced the winner of 
a technical split-decision, giving him back the World Boxing Council 
super-lightweight title he lost to Randall last January. 
</P>
<P>
 After Chavez, who was getting hit hard all night and was trying to keep close 
to avoid Randall's long rights and lefts, received a large cut over his right 
eye with two seconds remaining in the eighth round because of an accidental 
head butt from Randall, the fight was stopped because Chavez was ruled not able 
to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight went to the scorecards through all eight rounds. Following WBC 
rules, Randall was deducted one point for the inadvertent butt. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Tamotsu Tomihara of Hawaii scored it for Randall, 76-75. But judges Ray 
Solis of Mexico and Dalby Shirley of Las Vegas both ruled in favor of Chavez -- 
Solis (who favored Chavez in the first Randall fight) by 77-74, Shirley by 
76-75. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the point deduction for the butt, it would have been a draw. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like winning this way," Chavez said. "I don't want any controversy. I 
wanted to win without any doubt. I think open-scoring should be a part of 
boxing so the public doesn't walk away with a bad feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "(But) I don't think that butt was unintentional." 
</P>
<P>
 If the butt had been ruled intentional, Randall would have been deducted two 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 After the decision was announced, Randall and his trainer, Aaron Snowell, 
bolted from the ring at a near sprint in visible disgust. 
</P>
<P>
 Seconds before the decision, Randall said: "It was close all night, we were 
going in and out, we were both trying to get off first. I didn't want to butt 
him. . . . If I did, it was an accidental butt, but I think I still won the 
fight." 
</P>
<P>
 The fight began as an accelerated repeat fo the first, with Randall (49-3-1) 
delivering more punishment more swiftly. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez (90-1-1), who said before the fight that he would put constant pressure 
on Randall, opened up on the attack and landed a few of his famous hooks to the 
body in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 But also in the first, reminding of when he lost two points for low blows in 
the first bout, Chavez was warned by referee Mills Lane for a low blow. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second round came the exact left-right to the jaw combination from 
Randall that knocked down Chavez for the first time in his career in the 
January fight. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, moments into the second, Randall's straight right arched over 
Chavez's lowered left and buckled Chavez, almost putting him down again before 
Chavez regained his balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall was warned himself later in the round for a low punch that had Chavez 
grimacing in pain for about 10 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The third was more of the same, with Chavez chasing and being punished for it 
by Randall's apparently unblockable right hand. By the third, Chavez was cut 
over the bridge of his nose -- again, similar to the circumstances of the first 
bout, when Chavez sustained several welts on his nose and cheeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth Chavez slowed the charge and seemed to locate a better rhythm by 
landing several left hooks to the body and staying away from the more violent 
Randall shots. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth saw the best action of the fight -- for one 40-second period, 
Randall caught Chavez against the ropes and fired long right after long right 
to Chavez's face. Chavez answered with a couple of hooks to the body, but 
Randall came out of the round having scored the hardest and most punches. 
</P>
<P>
 Solis gave Chavez the fourth, fifth, sixth and eighth rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez was more effective in the sixth, but Randall came right back at him in 
the seventh and eighth, leading off the combinations with sharp lefts that had 
Chavez teetering back two or three steps. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the eighth, and, and Chavez was a champion again.

SCREEINING ROOM; 'SOUTHERN WINDS' BLOW DURING BEST OF THE HAWAI'I FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The 1994 Asia-Pacific Film Tour: Best of the Hawai'i International Film 
Festival continues at 5 tonight at USC's Norris Theater with the captivating 
"Southern Winds," an anthology film to which four notable filmmakers have 
contributed beautifully articulated, well-matched vignettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, two of the four contrast the corrupt life of the big city with the 
hard but decent rural existence: Slamet Rahardo Djarot's "Mirage" presents 
Jakarta as a merciless, glittering snare for a young woman from the country, 
whereas Cherd Songsri's "The Tree of Life" finds a Bangkok construction tycoon 
returning to his native countryside to draw strength from his roots to face 
impending bankruptcy.  
</P>
<P>
 Mike De Leon's dark satire "Aliwan Paradise" takes its title from a Manila 
movie palace where the "Ministry of Entertainment," established to divert the 
masses from social ills, tempts a stunning-looking but impoverished young 
couple who've come to audition; De Leon's clever twist protests the degradation 
Filipinos face just as much in the country as in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The most assured and inspired episode of all is Shoji Kogami's sharp fantasy, 
"Tokyo Game," in which a bored retired office worker, via a virtual reality 
video game, gets to fulfill his greatest desire, which is to relive his life as 
a salaried man. But in the present-day business world he discovers his fanatic 
workaholism is disastrously out of style. 
</P>
<P>
 Iranian filmmaker Mohsen Makhmalbaf's "The Cyclist" (Tuesday at 5 p.m.) is a 
joltingly well-told tale, with endless social, economic and political 
implications, about an Afghan immigrant so desperate to pay for his wife's 
hospital care that he agrees to ride a bike for seven days, his marathon 
provoking much lucrative gambling for its promoter. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be followed at 7:30 by Xie Fei's stunning feminist work, "Women From 
the Lake of Scented Souls," about a rural entrepreneur who runs a sesame oil 
mill while coping with an alcoholic husband and trying to marry off a retarded 
son. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spotlight on Hawaii," on Thursday and Friday starting at 6 p.m., is composed 
of videos dealing with some aspect of Hawaiian culture and history and the 
attempt by the dwindling native population to reclaim and preserve its lands 
and heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 The strongest is Puhipau and Joan Lander's "Act of War" (Friday at 8 p.m.) is 
a stirring, rigorous, step-by-step account of the U.S. invasion of Hawaii and 
overthrow of its monarchy in 1893, which reveals this outrage to be the 
culmination of the white man's systematic -- not to mention racist and hugely 
hypocritical -- exploitation, oppression and decimation of native Hawaiians and 
their culture that got under way the instant Captain Cook dropped anchor in 
1788.

 Boetticher Tribute: In the American Cinematheque's tribute this weekend at the 
Directors Guild to director Budd Boetticher don't overlook the two delightful 
segments of the television show "Maverick" screening Saturday at 4:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The first, the series' pilot episode, finds James Garner's cocky but 
do-gooding drifter taking on a crooked silver baron (Edmund Lowe); in the 
second, a woman (Karen Steele) with a past ensnared by a greedy Mike Conners, 
tries to con a smitten Maverick. Vigorously directed, they are shrewd and witty 
but are driven by a firm sense of right and wrong. Garner and Boetticher will 
discuss them afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Also screening are four of Boetticher's fabled Randolph Scott Westerns -- 
three with new 35mm prints -- plus his epic bullfighting films, "The 
Bullfighter and the Lady" (Friday at 7) and "Arruza" (Saturday at 4:15), and 
his gangster classic "The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond" (Sunday at 3). 
Boetticher and many of his colleagues will be on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Information: (213) 466-FILM. 
</P>
<P>
 Religion's Role: Teodoro Maniaci and Francine Rzeznik's "One Nation Under God" 
(at the Nuart at noon this Saturday and Sunday only) is a sobering, 
comprehensive, well-researched and evenhanded account of the attempt by 
Christian fundamentalist groups -- Exodus International in particular -- to 
"cure" homosexuality.

STREET SMART / NORA ZAMICHOW: DRIVING HOME A POINT: THEY LOVE CENTURY FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Lon Burns can think of no better commute than zipping along the Century 
Freeway, Los Angeles' newest thoroughfare, behind the wheel of his red '50 
Chevy flatbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most Angelenos, Burns can claim that his commute has improved. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns started driving the Century after it opened last fall. He cut about 15 
minutes from what was sometimes a one-hour commute from his Manhattan Beach 
home to his Downtown Los Angeles office, where he heads the Southern California 
Assn. for Philanthropy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a true fan of the Century Freeway. If the Harbor Freeway would only move 
as quickly. . . ," Burns sighed. 
</P>
<P>
 He's not the only one.  
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks after the Northridge earthquake, traffic on the Century rose 17%, 
reaching 200,000 cars a day at its peak. With closure of the Santa Monica 
Freeway, the city's major east-west artery, commuters swarmed to what had been 
one of the city's best-kept secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake was "a big shot in the arm as far as increasing ridership usage," 
said Chuck O'Connell, the local Caltrans deputy district director of 
operations.  
</P>
<P>
 The newly reopened Santa Monica now accommodates about 94% of its normal 
volume. But hundreds stayed with their newfound love, the Century, where 9% 
more vehicles travel than before the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a small shift with a big impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I hit the Century, I feel basically I'm home. To me, it's almost like 
pulling into my driveway; the hard part is over," said Burns, 50. "I love 
riding the Century Freeway in my Chevy." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Santa Monica Freeway reopened last month, it gradually won back most 
of its regulars. Officials readjusted traffic signals on surface streets so 
they no longer favored east-west flow of vehicles. Alternate routes, such as 
Jefferson Boulevard, which handled 48,000 cars daily after the quake, were 
reduced to carrying close to their normal load of 21,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But some motorists, once introduced to the Century (formally known as the 
Glenn M. Anderson Freeway or Interstate 105) are not about to switch back to 
the Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Century is Jorge Carreon's freeway of choice. Although a post-quake 
newcomer to the Century, Carreon, who lives in Long Beach, is a devotee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't get on the Santa Monica Freeway; I've never known it -- in the entire 
time I've been driving -- to be uncrowded," said Carreon, 26, a native 
Californian and a publicist at Samuel Goldwyn Co. "There's no way in hell I'd 
attempt that during rush hour; I refuse to fight traffic anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Carreon used to make audiotapes of opera and sing along when he got stuck in 
traffic, belting out verses. No more. Instead, he chooses the slightly longer 
route to his Century City office, taking the Long Beach Freeway to the Century, 
then going north on Sepulveda Boulevard and Overland Avenue to reach Pico 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't bother Carreon that not all the Century Freeway interchange ramps 
have opened. It just diminishes the number of drivers, ensuring that the 
Century is not for everyone. (The remaining interchanges are expected to open 
by June. These include: the northbound San Diego Freeway to the eastbound 
Century; the southbound San Diego to the westbound Century; the eastbound 
Century to the northbound San Diego, and the eastbound Century to the 
southbound San Diego.) 
</P>
<P>
 Carreon is a freeway aficionado, with an opinion about virtually every 
thoroughfare. The San Diego, for instance, "is hell on Earth." The Harbor 
Freeway, he says, is crowded and "really nasty." 
</P>
<P>
 The Century? "This one is cool. Stark. Postmodern, Jetson kind of design," he 
said. "When you get to those big bridges by Hawthorne, it's like a Disneyland 
ride. You get the most glorious view of the city from the diamond lane ramp. 
It's a ramp to heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 And with his discovery of the Century, Carreon has made his peace as a 
commuter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The freeways are my friend; I've learned to accept their existence," he said. 
"I notice that people who weren't raised here can't deal with it. Those poor 
saps.  
</P>
<P>
 It's because of them we're having the congestion problem now." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Flight attendant Lissa Thompson of Newport Beach cannot afford to be 
hopelessly mired in traffic and late to work. Although she is required to reach 
Los Angeles International Airport an hour before her flight, she usually leaves 
herself a two-hour margin. Before the Century Freeway opened, she once got 
stuck in a SigAlert; she reached her plane five minutes before it pulled out. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, Thompson is far more confident about her commute to LAX. She also 
notices a different kind of commuter sharing the roadway with her. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are not the real sophisticated hellbent drivers that you see on 
the 405," said Thompson, 39. "They are more middle class, driving older, more 
beat-up cars. It's refreshing." 
</P>
<P>
 But she, like the others, expressed some concern that as word leaks out about 
the Century Freeway, it might begin to lose its charm and become bogged down 
with newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as any resident with a favorite, quiet, neighborhood eatery dreads a rave 
restaurant review, commuters begin to feel protective of their routes, Lon 
Burns explains. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly hope people who could drive the Century will not ," Burns said. 
"Leave it the way it is! We don't need any more drivers on it."

LOS ANGELES BUILDS UP A REPUTATION AMONG ARCHITECTS; DESIGN: NATIONAL GROUP IS 
COMING HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE '56, DRAWN PARTLY BY RISING LOCAL STARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Ever have a long-absent relative come to your home and snoop around, making 
judgments about your furniture, taste, cleanliness, finances and lifestyle? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, imagine all of Los Angeles County as your home and think about 9,000 of 
the most finicky guests coming to inspect the urban sprawl en masse for the 
first time in 38 years. That's about to happen this week when the American 
Institute of Architects holds its annual national convention in Los Angeles, a 
city the influential organization has avoided since 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 After recession, riots, fires and earthquakes, this may not be the ideal time 
to show off Los Angeles to an out-of-town army of architects, planners, 
designers and insulation salesmen. But, the hosts are taking the long view. 
</P>
<P>
 With seminars and tours focused on, among other topics, Downtown skyscrapers, 
Malibu beach houses, ethnic neighborhoods and the unavoidable seismic safety, 
they want to display the incredible changes in L.A. over the past four decades 
-- touting how a megalopolis grew up from oil fields and orange groves into a 
showplace of contemporary design. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think first and foremost is that Los Angeles is such a vital city. And 
since architects are deeply interested in the creation of cities, it's a 
logical place to come and get a big-city fix," explained William Chapin, a 
Rochester, N.Y., architect who is the group's national president. "L.A. offers 
such a complexity of urban ills and benefits, the menu is so many pages long, 
that it is going to be very interesting and very surprising for the 
uninformed." 
</P>
<P>
 The convention's literature calls Los Angeles the "City on the Edge," 
connoting Pacific coastline and earthquake faults as well as "the leading edge 
of a global culture whose movies, music, television, fashion, lifestyles and 
the arts all seem to spring from some mystical point just west of Beverly 
Hills." 
</P>
<P>
 That attracted Charles Bullock, a semi-retired architect from Beaumont, Tex. 
He is coming to Los Angeles for the first time since 1958 and is planning to 
take tours of Frank Lloyd Wright-designed landmarks in Hollywood, of 
turn-of-the-century Pasadena bungalows by the Greene and Greene firm and of the 
newly restored and expanded Central Library in Downtown. His memories contrast 
sharply with today's Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't seem to me like a big city at the time," Bullock said in a 
telephone interview. "I had been to New York and D.C., and Los Angeles didn't 
impress me as being a real metropolitan area particularly." 
</P>
<P>
 If the organization had a collective memory of its last Los Angeles gathering, 
it would recall a city that had few freeways, no Music Center, no Dodger 
Stadium, no County Museum, no Museum of Contemporary Art, no Bunker Hill 
skyscrapers and no Pacific Design Center. It would have encountered a county 
population about half the current 9.1 million and with far fewer Latinos and 
Asians. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you came here last 40 years ago, you're just going to have to take your 
heart pills because it's completely changed," said Virginia Tanzmann, president 
of the architects group's Los Angeles chapter. "One of the great attributes of 
L.A. in general is that constant and wonderful churning, some of which has 
problems related to it. But if you look at the overall picture, you should say, 
'I just can't miss seeing it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The current superstar of Los Angeles architecture, Frank O. Gehry, is 
scheduled to deliver the welcoming address to the American Institute of 
Architects on Friday at the Los Angeles Convention Center, where the three-day 
meeting is being held. Once the bad boy of American architecture because of his 
use of common materials such as chain-link fences, Gehry won the Pritzker Prize 
-- design's equivalent of a Nobel -- in 1989 and now is in demand around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 A tour will survey such Gehry buildings in Venice as his home and the 
Chiat/Day advertising agency headquarters (most known for its giant binoculars 
sculpture out front) and will stop at his Santa Monica studio to see models of 
his Disney Concert Hall, under construction Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Other attractions include a hard-hat tour led by architect Richard Meier of 
his emerging Getty Center art campus in Brentwood and an inspection of Westside 
restaurants that stress interior design as much as food. A more down-to-earth 
itinerary is offered by "The Real L.A.," which will take architects to Skid 
Row, Chinatown, East Los Angeles, Watts, Koreatown, Pico-Union and Florence and 
Normandie avenues, a flash point of the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some architects, to be sure, are coming mainly to glad-hand for job tips in 
their badly depressed national market and to attend the many technical 
sessions. Seminars on seismic safety will be linked to excursions to 
quake-damaged areas in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 As a guest from tornado country, Gregory Newport, president of the 
organization's chapter in Lincoln, Neb., said he is curious "to see some of the 
effects of the earthquake and the aftermath of the riots, how much has gotten 
rebuilt and how much hasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, earthquakes were on the minds of architects at the 1956 
convention, too. According to newspaper reports, speakers then suggested that 
seismologists in the future would be able to forecast earthquakes "as 
weathermen today forecast storms." 
</P>
<P>
 That prediction hasn't come true, but another one unfortunately has. One 
seismic expert told conventioneers 38 years ago that "we must expect a severe 
shock of great destructive potential at any time." 
</P>
<P>
 Quake fear was not why the group stayed away from Los Angeles so long, 
officials said. The organization repeatedly chose San Francisco when looking 
for a Western meeting site because, they said, it is more picturesque and 
urbane. But the prominence of Southern California architects such as Gehry, 
Michael Rotondi, Eric Owen Moss, Barton Myers, Jon Jerde and others, plus the 
construction boom here 10 years ago made Los Angeles a more compelling venue. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason was the expansion of the Los Angeles Convention Center, which 
had been inadequate for big meetings like the group's convention. The newly 
enlarged center opened last fall to acclaim from architecture critics. Further 
tying the building to this week's events, its executive architect, Ki Suh Park 
of Gruen Associates, heads the local committee planning the convention. Park, a 
Korean American who has been active in post-riot rebuilding efforts, will be 
given the national American Institute of Architects award that recognizes 
social responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite the fact that we had lots of events that were adverse to our image, 
such as the earthquake, civil disturbances, fire and flood, this is still one 
of the most exciting cities in the country and the world. . . ," Park said. 
"This is a good time to look at what makes the city tick." 
</P>
<P>
 Museums and galleries around the city this month have architecture exhibits 
and symposiums linked to the convention. The Museum of Contemporary Art will 
showcase innovative city planning and design projects in "Urban Revisions: 
Current Projects for the Public Realm." The Japanese American National Museum 
has scheduled a show about Asian American architects and California architects 
working in Asia. A photography exhibit at the Los Angles Central Library 
celebrates the 100th anniversary of the Parkinson architecture firm, which 
designed City Hall and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The Municipal Art 
Gallery in Barnsdall Park offers exhibits about Downtown before World War II 
and about inner-city neighborhoods today.

VICTIMS OF MALIBU FIRE BATTLE CITY TO REBUILD; DISASTER: THE HOPES OF A COUPLE 
IN LAS FLORES CANYON ARE ON HOLD WHILE OFFICIALS CONSIDER A PLAN TO BUY THEIR 
CREEKSIDE LAND AND USE IT FOR FLOOD CONTROL.

<P>
 In the Malibu canyon where Paul Mantee's house burned to the ground last 
November, wildflowers have poked through the topsoil, lending a splash of color 
to the charred landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is where I want to be," said Mantee, a novelist and actor who is 
embroiled in a struggle to rebuild after losing everything in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 But he fears that Malibu may try to take his property as a possible buffer 
against future disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Although local officials have done much to speed recovery from a disaster that 
claimed 262 homes, Mantee and partner Susan Shaw are hostages to a debate about 
the future of their beloved Las Flores Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Aided by fee waivers and reduced red tape, scores of homeowners in other parts 
of Malibu are well along in clearing their building plans with city officials, 
and a few have begun construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say at least 70 homeowners have attained permits from the city's 
planning department, an ordinarily time-consuming process, and another three 
dozen are on the verge of doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've tried to do everything to make it easier for fire victims to rebuild," 
said Bob Benard, the city's planning director. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a different story in Las Flores, where the fire denuded entire 
hillsides, leaving a canyon long plagued by floods and mudslides more 
vulnerable than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Eager to take advantage of federal disaster relief, local officials are 
considering a plan that may include acquiring several properties along Las 
Flores Creek, including Mantee's, to buttress a nearby landslide and ease the 
creek's chronic flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on what is done, cost estimates range from $11 million upward. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our objective is to do what's in the best interests of the people of the 
canyon and the community as a whole," says John P. Clement, Malibu's public 
works director. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the fire, Mantee and Shaw had lived in a creekside four-plex. They 
leased three of the units. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had just done this dreadfully cheap horror film in Romania and had sent 
back the money to remodel the kitchen," recalled Mantee, perhaps best-known as 
Detective Al Corassa in the "Cagney & Lacey" TV series. "It was as if we'd 
fixed it up to burn." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he is uncertain if he will ever be able to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 Malibu's elected officials are expected to decide by this summer whether to 
approve property acquisitions as part of plans to protect the canyon against 
future disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 The canyon engenders uncommon loyalty from its residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Its shady glens and ocean vistas make it popular with writers, artists and 
others looking for solitude. The creek is a magnet for deer and other wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 But the canyon is also rife with ecological problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The lower portion lies at the foot of a giant landslide, which in 1984 gobbled 
up eight hillside homes and wiped out half a mile of Rambla Pacifico Road, 
cutting off the only direct route to Pacific Coast Highway for 550 residents on 
the west rim. 
</P>
<P>
 The slide changed the course of the creek, shoving it 60 yards to the east. 
Engineers say the slide still poses a threat to the creek and Las Flores Canyon 
Road, the only artery leading out of the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 To the east, another 50 properties on Las Flores Mesa, whose residents must 
traverse the canyon to escape fire, are in danger of isolation if the canyon 
floods. 
</P>
<P>
 And officials are concerned that it will. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the fires, soil experts say, the area could face increased danger 
from floods and landslides for the next eight years. It may take that long, 
they say, for the vegetation -- vital for absorbing and dispersing rain -- to 
regenerate. 
</P>
<P>
 To solve the problems, Malibu officials hope to persuade the federal 
government to help pay for securing or removing the landslide and dredging the 
creek to prevent flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 If that happened, supporters say, it would be possible to rebuild the part of 
Rambla Pacifico Road wiped out by the 1984 slide. 
</P>
<P>
 But the best and most affordable way to deal with the slide, some experts 
suggest, is to build a huge earthen buttress at its toe. That, in turn, would 
make it necessary to acquire some, if not all, of nine properties along the 
creek. 
</P>
<P>
 As the most vocal opponents of acquisition, Shaw and Mantee have been 
criticized by Rambla residents and others who see a chance to reopen the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some canyon residents see acquisitions as inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (city officials) are living in a fantasy world if they think they can 
somehow mitigate these problems without affecting properties along the creek," 
said Madelyn Glickfeld, a member of the California Coastal Commission, whose 
Las Flores home was destroyed in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shaw and Mantee are undeterred. 
</P>
<P>
 They were encouraged recently when the Malibu council urged city engineers to 
come up with a solution that keeps acquisitions to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are baby steps," Shaw said. "We aren't celebrating victory yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The criticism, she says, comes with the territory. 
</P>
<P>
 "What keeps us going is this vision of where we want to be a year from now: 
That's in our rebuilt home, listening to the creek gurgle and watching our 
roses grow."

D.A. RAISES PRIORITY OF LOW-LEVEL OFFENSES; LAW: MICHAEL D. BRADBURY HAS DRAWN 
ON $2 MILLION FROM PROP. 172 TO HIRE 19 NEW ATTORNEYS. MANY WILL PROSECUTE 
MISDEMEANORS IGNORED SINCE '91. 
</P>

<P>
 Most people driving without a license, mistreating their animals or pulling 
too many clams from the ocean have escaped prosecution in Ventura County for 
nearly three years. 
</P>
<P>
 But those days will soon be over, the district attorney's office says. 
</P>
<P>
 Using his $2-million allotment from Proposition 172 -- the voter-approved 
half-cent sales tax for public safety -- Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury has 
hired 19 new deputy district attorneys, many of whom will be prosecuting 
low-level misdemeanors that have been largely ignored since August, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury once had a staff of 24 attorneys prosecuting misdemeanors, but severe 
funding cuts reduced it to 14 at one point. With the new hires, it is back up 
to 21, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Proposition 172 funds, just about all misdemeanors will become a 
priority once again, said Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin J. McGee. 
</P>
<P>
 Many public officials who had lamented the decision to stop prosecuting some 
misdemeanors said they were pleased to see those crimes getting more attention. 
</P>
<P>
 But McGee said it will take a month or two to get the new hires fully trained 
because some are recent law school graduates. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the new prosecutors, 27-year-old Tina Nunes-Ober, said she looks 
forward to trying misdemeanors as she tackles trial work for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 But another new hire, 54-year-old Bob Calvert, is not new to prosecuting 
crimes. He comes from the Santa Barbara district attorney's office with 16 
years experience, prosecuting everything from minor crimes to murders before 
juries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doing a misdemeanor trial or a murder trial is the same thing," Calvert said. 
"You still have to convince 12 people of the facts." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Chief Sheriff's Deputy Ken Kipp said that with the new emphasis 
on misdemeanors, criminals will get the message that their behavior won't be 
tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his deputies have continued to make the same number of misdemeanor 
arrests the past three years, despite the fact that many would not be accepted 
by the district attorney's office for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand that the rejection ratio during those times was higher, and I 
would suspect as the district attorney's office hires on more personnel that 
the ratio will drop," Kipp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal advocates hailed the change in policy, adding that since mid-1991 
prosecutors have been less willing to file charges of animal cruelty. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, said Joyce George, president of the Humane Society of Ventura County, 
prosecutors stopped filing misdemeanor animal-cruelty charges altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were several cases of ours that were not prosecuted because they were 
not felonies," said George, who said prosecutions went from about a dozen a 
year to about four a year. "Sure, they were just misdemeanors, but tell the 
animal that. We are certainly in favor of prosecuting misdemeanors again." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they never flat-out rejected any category of crime for 
prosecution. But they concede that they focused on the more egregious 
misdemeanor offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never had a complete 'we-won't-file-them' attitude," said Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Nancy Ayers, supervisor of the misdemeanor unit. "But we were looking at 
them with a lot more decision making." 
</P>
<P>
 Ayers said budget problems also affected the ability of the district 
attorney's office to fill the jobs of some felony prosecutors lost through 
attrition. 
</P>
<P>
 She said most of her experienced misdemeanor prosecutors were promoted to 
felony divisions once the new group of attorneys hired in March arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 This has resulted in a misdemeanor unit that is eager but relatively 
inexperienced, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not very many people have very much experience," Ayers acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 But new prosecutor Nunes-Ober said she expects most of her colleagues to catch 
on to their jobs quickly because of their enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunes-Ober, who graduated in 1992 from Suffolk University in Boston, moved to 
California with her husband, Rich. After two years of public-interest work, she 
decided to become a prosecutor, but every office in the state said the same 
thing: not hiring because of funding. 
</P>
<P>
 But she persisted and got one of the 19 new jobs in Ventura County when the 
budget loosened up. 
</P>
<P>
 After a month of training, Nunes-Ober won her first case three weeks ago. It 
was a marijuana-possession case, one that might not have been tried before 
March for lack of resources. The defendant was fined several hundred dollars, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was nervous and excited at the same time," said Nunes-Ober, who is 
soft-spoken but authoritative in court. "Your adrenaline is going because 
you're not sure you know what you are doing. But it's the only way to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Calvert tried his first case in 1975 as a rookie prosecutor in Santa 
Barbara County, where his 16 years as a deputy district attorney included a 
stint as felony supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, Calvert obtained a conviction against Yolo County prosecutor 
Steve Henderson, who had been arrested in Santa Barbara for drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Calvert said, he decided to spend time doing other things in life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got on my sailboat, headed out to the South Pacific and spent two years 
floating around out there," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his experience, Calvert said his return to the courtroom made him 
nervous. His first trial was also a misdemeanor drunk-driving case, which he 
won. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly had butterflies when I did the trial," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his last misdemeanor trial too. After just a few weeks on the job, he 
was promoted to the felony sexual-assaults unit.

COMPUTERS TO HELP COUNTY KEEP TRACK OF IMMUNIZATIONS; DISEASES: THE PUBLIC 
HEALTH PROJECT WOULD PROVIDE AN ELECTRONIC SYSTEM TO FOCUS ON THE 40% OF THE 
AREA'S TODDLERS IN NEED OF PROPER SHOTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After years of fighting childhood diseases with needles and serum, Ventura 
County has enlisted a new weapon: the computer. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Public Health Services Department is setting up a computer system 
that should one day tell doctors which children need shots and when they need 
them. The computer could even call parents at home to remind them about 
immunizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm trying to do is build an immunization tracking system that we can 
use countywide," said Dr. Gary Feldman, public health officer. 
</P>
<P>
 With an estimated 40% of Ventura County's toddlers lacking proper 
vaccinations, Feldman is hoping that doctors and nurses will begin thinking 
about shots whenever they see a child for a routine checkup, clinic visit or 
emergency room call. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's efforts coincide with a national push for more comprehensive 
childhood immunizations. A study released last month by the Institute of 
Medicine of the federal National Academy of Sciences found that one-third of 
the nation's 2-year-olds have not received a full set of shots. President 
Clinton has made childhood immunization a major initiative of his health 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Because schools require certain inoculations before allowing children to enter 
kindergarten, nearly all kids have their shots by age 4 or 5. But for many 
children, that's not soon enough, Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The diseases we're protecting against most affect kids under 2," he said. "So 
most kids are immunized, but they're immunized too late." 
</P>
<P>
 Before their second birthday, children should have a series of shots for such 
diseases as hepatitis, polio, diphtheria, tetanus, mumps, measles and rubella. 
A chicken pox vaccine is being tested and soon could be added to the series. 
</P>
<P>
 Notably absent is the smallpox vaccination, a painful shot that would leave an 
ugly scar on children's arms. Now that immunization has virtually wiped out the 
disease, the inoculation is no longer needed, Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the ultimate goal of immunization. For now, Ventura County is content 
to increase the proportion of vaccinated youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman, a pediatrician with a master's degree in computer science, is 
developing a high-tech registry with updated vaccination information on 
children across the county. San Bernardino County recently received a grant to 
set up such a program, and several other locales in California have started 
building registries. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County has hired systems analyst Michelle Freier to set up its 
program, which should be ready within a year and is not expected to require 
substantial additional funding. Freier said the Department of Public Health 
Services already has the necessary software, part of a package now used for 
billing and financial data. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer program has the capacity to keep track of thousands of children 
and issue postcards or even make phone calls reminding parents about shots, 
Freier said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first step in building a registry involves entering existing records for 
children treated by public health workers. Then, the program could expand to 
include those immunized at county clinics or Ventura County Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Feldman hopes to enlist private physicians and their patients in the 
program. That would require state legislation, allowing doctors to waive their 
young patients' confidentiality on immunizations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a registry is set up, doctors and nurses could turn to it when they treat 
any toddler. County workers could also check for immunizations when they are 
administering social-service programs, such as the federal Women, Infants and 
Children program for new mothers, Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some children do not receive the proper shots simply because their parents 
can't afford them -- a series of hepatitis shots can cost $70, and a full set 
of vaccinations ranges from $150 to $200. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, public health has begun offering free immunizations, including 
sending nurses out to neighborhoods to vaccinate children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great that they do this," said Tammy Reed of Newbury Park, who brought 
her 21-month-old son, A. J., to a free clinic there. "It's so expensive to get 
those shots through the pediatrician and the insurance doesn't cover it." 
</P>
<P>
 Reed's doctor told her about the clinic rather than charging her for the 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the free immunizations, some children go unprotected because their 
parents are uninformed about them or don't understand the need. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no sense of urgency with immunizations," explained senior public 
health educator Selfa Saucedo of the county's immunization program. "There's 
not a big epidemic of polio, meningitis." 
</P>
<P>
 A measles outbreak in 1990 prompted a rush of parents bringing children in for 
shots. "Since then, it seems people get lulled into a false sense of security," 
Saucedo said. The new computer system should not only keep track of children's 
vaccinations, but remind parents when to come in, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should pick up a lot of kids who have been falling through the cracks."

RESIDENTS FEAR AVENUE GOING ONE WAY: DOWN; SOME DOUBT THAT MEETING WILL HELP 
VENTURA NEIGHBORHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Against a backdrop of growing violence and community pessimism, Ventura city 
leaders and residents of the Ventura Avenue neighborhood will meet this week to 
discuss problems ranging from increased crime to chronic poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 The two groups will meet Thursday night at Sheridan Way School, in the heart 
of the neighborhood's most troubled section, to attempt to find new approaches 
to the problems facing one of Ventura's oldest communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents say they are trying to remain optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 But after years of drug dealings on the corner, shootings in the street and 
gang members settling into the house next door, many say they are skeptical 
that anyone can jump-start change in their tree-lined neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "My personal experience is that these rap sessions don't go anywhere," said 
Yvette Sutton, who has lived on Vince Street for three years. "If they need me 
to support them in their efforts, then fine, I'll do that. But I'm not 
interested in having a bunch of meetings where we shout at each other and point 
the finger." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Buford does not disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't blame somebody for being skeptical," Buford said. "All you can do 
is say it didn't work before, so you try again." 
</P>
<P>
 The impetus for Thursday's meeting, which will be attended by a city 
delegation expected to include most council members and city police officials, 
began last month in the wee hours of the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 After weeks of listening to bullets whistling through the nighttime air and 
months of watching sidewalk drug deals so casual that they actually backed up 
traffic for blocks, residents of West Harrison Street woke up on April 16 to 
the deafening sounds of ammunition spraying against their houses and even 
through their windows. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was around 2 or 2:30 in the morning," recalled West Harrison resident 
Karen Walker. "It was like the Fourth of July fireworks grand finale. I'd heard 
enough gunfire in the previous weeks to know what it was, but I'd never heard 
anything like THIS. I was just scared." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said unknown gunmen fired about 30 rounds into houses, shops and cars 
parked near Olive Street and Harrison Avenue. No one was hurt, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 But though police officers showed up that morning and again later that day, 
residents quickly grew frustrated when they saw nothing about the incident in 
the local press and heard no reaction from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials say they have already begun a surveillance operation that 
resulted in two raids April 23, 10 raids May 3, and eight arrests altogether, 
in connection with the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can say that's routine, then I guess that's routine," said Sgt. Carl 
Handy of the Ventura Police Department's special enforcement unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Unaware of the police efforts, which Handy says were intentionally kept quiet, 
a cluster of angry residents took the responsibility upon themselves to alert 
the public and badgered the Police Department for more patrols along their 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 They flooded city employees and council members with calls, demanding to know 
what they could do to help stem the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a lot of yelling for us to get their attention," said Len Evans, one 
of the West Harrison residents who organized the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the neighborhood group, most of them newcomers to the saga of 
strife and supposed municipal neglect, say they soon discovered it was hard to 
tell who was more jaded -- their fellow residents or the city officials 
representing them. "Buford tried to argue us out of this at first," Evans said. 
"He was worried that everybody would start yelling at the police in the meeting 
and then nothing would come beyond that. He said you can't do anything in the 
neighborhood here because there is no one to contact." 
</P>
<P>
 Buford did not deny that he was initially concerned about planning yet another 
forum in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Len (Evans) and I had a fairly lively discussion," he said. "But I welcomed 
somebody calling me and saying he wanted to do something. In the long run, 
that's what will make all the difference." 
</P>
<P>
 The organizers have since convinced Buford that it is time, once again, to 
call a meeting of the Ventura Avenue neighborhood. They say they are happy with 
the Police Department's quick, intensive response, though they hope now that 
police attention to their neighborhood will continue beyond the raids. 
</P>
<P>
 But the crucial part of the battle, they say, may be still ahead. "I'm 
skeptical that the neighbors are not going to show up," Walker said. "I'm 
worried that many neighbors around here will not stay around for the long haul, 
say that they're willing to help, roll up their sleeves and really get their 
hands dirty about doing something." 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents say the reasons for the neighborhood's seemingly blase 
attitude toward its problems are varied and complex. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, they say, the area is dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't know if you are talking to gangbangers -- you don't know who you 
are talking to," said West Harrison resident Larry Bacca, who met neighbors 
Evans and Walker only on the night of the shootings, when they were all 
standing out in the street scared to go back in their houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Evans: "There are people in this neighborhood who look like nice old 
gentlemen, but I know they have gang affiliations. You are leery of your 
neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Arlene Martinez, who has lived on or near the neighborhood most of her 27 
years, said the reason improvement efforts rarely work is because most are 
superficial fixes for deep-seated problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people down here are dead because they have no dreams," said Martinez, 
who is a professional flower arranger. "Nine times out of 10, their mother was 
on welfare, they were left to fend for themselves, and, well, they do what they 
have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Children join gangs as teen-agers because, for many, it is the only family 
type of situation they have known in years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need to get something done to educate people, from learning about 
politics to changing a diaper," she said. "It's not any exaggeration when they 
say that it takes a whole community to raise one child." 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood, however, is not solely an area of streets chockablock with 
gang members and the poor neighbors who fear them. Middle-class families -- 
with the finances and leisure time to fight for municipal improvements -- also 
live in the community. But many are isolated to a few, select streets and 
remain sheltered from the troubles just a short block away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I read that there's all these horrific things going on in our part of town, 
but I don't hear them and I don't see them," said Leslie Broude, a batik 
artist, who lives on quiet East Lewis Street. "I think this part of town has a 
lot of character." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reasons behind the apathy that some residents see as preventing 
progress, residents and city leaders alike say the community must change its 
attitude if life in the area is to improve. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it works both ways," said Councilman Gary Tuttle, who plans to attend 
Thursday's meeting. Tuttle is the only council member whom Ventura Avenue 
residents consistently mention as committed to and interested in their 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Citizens have to be prepared to say, 'I'm ready to do something,' " he said. 
"We've got to get people together, get them feeling that they are not alone in 
their individual houses and under siege. We've got to get rid of that 
perception." 
</P>
<P>
 Avenue-area residents say many city leaders also have to banish the perception 
that it is a throwaway neighborhood, one not worth investing in or fighting 
for. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like for the mayor to come down here as a person, a human being, not 
as a politician," Martinez said. "I would like him to come down here with an 
open ear, and a little bit of compassion."

STREET SMART: BOUNCING SEAWARD AVENUE BRIDGE GIVES DRIVER SHAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 How safe is the bridge over the Ventura Freeway on Seaward Avenue in Ventura? 
</P>
<P>
 While waiting on the bridge to make a left turn onto the northbound freeway, I 
often notice the bridge is definitely bouncing or vibrating strongly up and 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 This is especially noticeable when a large semi is crossing the bridge, 
although on occasion it has occurred with only cars on the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 I am concerned, as I have never experienced this on any other bridge in the 
highway system of California, and I have never heard of a concrete bridge 
designed to bounce up and down. 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Fiedler, Oxnard 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura engineer Nazir Lalani begs to differ. 
</P>
<P>
 The shaking you feel as you cross the Seaward bridge is intentional. 
</P>
<P>
 Bridges are, in fact, built to be flexible, Lalani says. Otherwise they would 
crack and snap at the slightest vibration. 
</P>
<P>
 Your safety level on the Seaward bridge is as good as it would be on any 
bridge that has not been retrofitted for earthquakes, Lalani says. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1997, the Seaward bridge will be replaced with a new, seismically sound 
bridge as part of a project to improve the traffic flow near the Seward 
entrance to the Ventura Freeway, Lalani says. 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Within the last few weeks, a stop sign was installed in the residential area 
at the corner of Henderson Road and Emerald Street (near Kimball and Telegraph 
roads). 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing wrong with having a stop sign at this intersection, but the 
implementation leaves much to be desired. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from being at eye level, the sign is at least 2 feet taller than any other 
stop sign in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the sign is placed as far away from the curb as possible, and is 
partially obscured by tree growth from a nearby house. 
</P>
<P>
 To top it all off, no effort has been made to paint a limit line or STOP 
warning on the street proper. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, I did not notice the sign until my wife pointed it out to me 
after I had been driving right by it for several days. 
</P>
<P>
 One could undoubtedly argue out of a conviction if a citation were to be 
issued for failing to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Why was the installation job so sloppy? 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Anderson, Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 This could be a case of a bumbling contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Ventura usually installs all its own stop signs, following very 
strict guidelines, says traffic engineer Nazir Lalani. 
</P>
<P>
 But occasionally, if city workers get backed up, they hire a contractor to do 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the case with the sign at Henderson and Emerald. 
</P>
<P>
 Lalani says the city will investigate the problem and, if need be, fix the 
sign. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 The traffic light at Collins Drive and Campus Park Drive in Moorpark needs 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 I've noticed the traffic sensors buried in the road, but they must be either 
turned off or are broken. 
</P>
<P>
 This is obvious because often I see cars from three directions waiting at a 
red light while the traffic has long passed through the one direction that has 
a green light. 
</P>
<P>
 I've never seen a signal that allows a green light for only one direction at a 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is supposed to help the traffic that is turning left, it is going to 
waste. Because the left-turn arrow stays on long after all cars are through 
turning. 
</P>
<P>
 Can the timing at this intersection be improved? 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Shea, Moorpark 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of July, you will see faster, better green lights at this 
intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 Timing at the intersection of Collins and Campus Park seems skewed because it 
has not been changed since the amount of traffic dropped after the connector 
between the Moorpark and Simi Valley freeways opened last fall, says Ken 
Gilbert, Moorpark's public works director. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy traffic led the city to allow the signal to be programmed for a green 
light for only one direction at a time, Gilbert says. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the traffic has dropped, the lighting will be changed to the more 
conventional two-way green light system. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Department of Transportation, which shares responsibility for 
the intersection, has promised to tinker with the timing to speed up the 
changing of the lights, Gilbert says.

WEEKEND KNIGHTS; STUDENTS AND BUSINESSMEN TURN INTO TITANS IN BLOODLESS BATTLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Curses and dust and the sharp clatter of swords rise from the thick of the 
battle in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 War is heck in Wildwood Park this Friday evening, as it is at nearly every 
workweek's end, with full permission from the police and park authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Fierce young men ages 14 to 30 slash relentlessly at "enemies" who huddle 
inside the park's stout wooden fort behind bamboo swords, plywood shields and 
8-foot pikes of plastic tubing padded with duct tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Bravado rules the mock battles -- medieval-style bouts that have been played 
out on a weekly basis by a group of Thousand Oaks amateur swashbucklers for the 
last 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighters fling insults and swear at each other between blows. Crippled by leg 
"wounds" and "injured" arms that hang useless at their sides, they laugh and 
sneer to mask their panic. 
</P>
<P>
 And the last man alive in the fort always "dies" valiantly, his bamboo blade 
flashing around him to beat back enemies closing in for the kill. 
</P>
<P>
 Slain and sweating, Dan Brethauer flops on the grass to watch the rest of his 
fellow soldiers fall one by one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boy, that was short and bloody," the clothing salesman says after the 
90-second battle, ripping off his pirate-style bandanna to run thick fingers 
through dense, reddish hair. 
</P>
<P>
 At 24, Brethauer has been battling buddies with bamboo shinai -- practice 
swords used in martial arts -- for about six years worth of Friday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Like his brethren, he is sworn to keep drugs and drink off the battlefield, 
and to follow the informal rules of combat: 
</P>
<P>
 Fighters struck on the arms and legs must stop using them. 
</P>
<P>
 Three wounded limbs mean death, and those hit in the back or chest must also 
fall down "dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Blows to the groin and head are forbidden. But beyond that, all's fair in war. 
</P>
<P>
 And like many of the other warriors, Brethauer has honed his swordsmanship to 
swift, athletic tautness that could shame even some Hollywood stuntmen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll need a warm-up," Brethauer says with a sigh. "Those last two battles 
sucked." Then he stands and whips his twin shinai into a blur around him, 
crossing swords with fellow "corpse" David Vasquez, a 22-year-old cashier, 
until it is time for the next battle. 
</P>
<P>
 At 30, Tom Warner has been fighting the longest, since that night in 1980 when 
he and some friends launched the weekly tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "A bunch of us were sitting in a friend's yard, and we decided it'd be a cool 
thing to do," explains Warner, a tall, stocky Thousand Oaks insurance 
underwriter, church worker and de facto leader of the motley crew of amateur 
swashbucklers. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who wants to fight can, Warner says. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Young, a 15-year-old Newbury Park High School student, is fighting this 
night for the first time, swiping tentatively at her foes with a variety of 
borrowed weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came down with some of my friends, and I got into it," she says, hefting a 
shinai . "It's fun. I'll have bruises, but it's fun." 
</P>
<P>
 The fun takes many forms -- for some it is the whirl and clack of parrying 
blades, for others the boyish camaraderie and testosterone rush of combat. 
</P>
<P>
 All the fighters take some glee in battlefield chatter -- jokes, insults, 
war-movie dialogue and Monty Python routines. 
</P>
<P>
 Two act out a boot camp scene from Stanley Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket": 
</P>
<P>
 "Lemme see your war face, son!" 
</P>
<P>
 "What's my war face, sir?" 
</P>
<P>
 "This is your war face, son: AAAAAAAAAARRRGGGHHH!" 
</P>
<P>
 The weapons are tough and fairly safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best guideline we have is you can use any weapon that you don't mind 
being hit with yourself," Warner says. 
</P>
<P>
 Some customize the popular shinai , adding extra padding at the tip that the 
rules say can be used to stab as well as slash. 
</P>
<P>
 Others fabricate funky medieval weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 A short tape-padded pipe can serve as a mace, while a long one is a pike -- 
regarded as a good weapon for beginners or cowards because it can strike from a 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
 A broomstick tipped with clothesline and a ball of tape makes a flail that can 
rip an opponent's sword from his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Forbidden is the dreaded carpet flail -- three linked rolls of heavy carpet 
with an unstoppable 8-foot reach that someone used one night with a roundhouse 
swing to clobber every one of his enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the 4-year-old who showed up one day with an older brother and 
a tiny pike -- one end tipped with fuzz -- threatening, "First I tickle you, 
then I KILL you." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Valera, a 22-year-old teacher-in-training, hefts a meaty battle-ax he has 
fashioned from plastic pipe and black foam pipe insulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I likes to HIT THINGS," he says, an evil gleam in his eye. "I've always had a 
really destructive attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends watch from a distance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of bizarre," says Janel Schnieder, 18, watching a male friend caper 
around the ramparts with a fake sword. "It's like a bunch of young boys 
reverting back to their childhood." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's interesting," admits her friend, Amy Stillman, 17 with detached cool. 
"You don't normally see these people walking around hitting each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'd be better," she says, sniffing at the combatants' jeans, T-shirts and 
combat boots, "if they dressed up." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it is easy to see the attraction that has kept some weekend warriors 
coming back to the never-ending battle of Wildwood Fort for four, five, even 
10, years. 
</P>
<P>
 The swordplay is a brutal, yet often elegant, sport that offers the thrill of 
combat without the threat of serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
 The shinai sting and bruise, but they do not cut. The only serious injuries in 
14 years have been a broken leg or arm here or there when a fighter failed to 
watch his step. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get the occasional eye poke," 17-year-old Brian Gantzer says offhandedly 
of combat, which everyone understands is done at their own risk. "It hurts real 
bad, but it goes away. No one's sued anybody, because we're not organized. 
We're just out here to have fun." 
</P>
<P>
 There is an added bonus, says Gantzer, who was drawn into sword fighting by 
his sister's longtime boyfriend, founding fighter Tom Warner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom's kept me basically drug free and party free -- and I've been invited to 
many keg parties," says Gantzer. 
</P>
<P>
 Brethauer adds, "We keep people who DO drugs and alcohol in the fort away." 
</P>
<P>
 Some summer nights, the battles go on until 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 They often start the same way: Teams of four or five warriors face off nearly 
motionless at the fort's 8-foot-high gate, trying to psych each other out 
before the first blows dissolve into chaotic brawling. 
</P>
<P>
 And they end the same way: When the last man dies. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth battle, Brian Gantzer is the last man. 
</P>
<P>
 Routed by invaders, he limps from fort to field on a wounded leg, his shield 
and shinai in hand and three howling swordsmen at his heels. 
</P>
<P>
 One hacks his good leg from beneath him. Gantzer goes down behind the shield, 
swinging wildly at the thicket of blades. 
</P>
<P>
 As they force him onto his back, Gantzer slashes out desperately, but Valera 
delivers the death blow, smashing his ax down onto the teen-ager's heaving 
chest. 
</P>
<P>
 Gantzer lies there for a minute in pain, having wrenched his arm in the 
skirmish. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he is up and trudging over the ramparts for the next battle.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; HARBOR A BIG FAMILY DRAW ON MOTHER'S DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five-month-old Melina Powell didn't know it was supposed to be her mom's day 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the infant's squirming, her parents, Dan and Cynthia Powell of 
Ventura, said it was their best Mother's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our first one with a child," said Cynthia Powell, cradling the infant 
over her shoulder on the patio at Cafe de La Riviera in the Ventura Harbor 
early Sunday afternoon. "It's been a long-awaited Mother's Day." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Powell said he planned all morning how best to pamper his wife and infant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started with mimosas, then enjoyed a brunch and the sun by the marina with 
some Dixieland jazz," said Dan Powell, an engineer for undersea recovery 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of others had the same idea Sunday as they celebrated Mother's Day at 
Ventura Harbor. Every restaurant patio was filled with families as tunes from 
the Main Street Dixieland Jazz band filled the air. After a series of weekend 
cloudbursts, temperatures rose into the high 60s under mostly clear skies. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year about this time, Gregg Simon of Malibu takes his wife somewhere 
she's never been. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do it every Mother's Day, get away somewhere and treat Mom," said Simon, a 
stockbroker who spent the weekend in Ventura County with his wife, Lisa, and 
their two children, Sarah-Jayne, 2 1/2, and Jordan, 5 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like Ventura," he said, a few feet from where Ken Layton of the Main Street 
Dixieland Jazz band was belting out some old favorites. "We'd been by here many 
times, but never to visit." 
</P>
<P>
 Layton said he and the band play the harbor area about twice a month. On 
Sunday afternoon, he found himself singing "You gotta see your Momma every 
night, or you won't see your Momma at all." 
</P>
<P>
 "We play that one all the time," he said during a break. "We're trying to work 
up tunes with women's names in them to celebrate Mother's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next we've got 'Sweet Lorraine' and 'Marie,' " he said. "Those go way back." 
</P>
<P>
 Down at Bay Queen Harbor Cruises, 10-year-old Shannon Spaulding was waiting in 
line to rent a paddle boat with her mother, Leslie. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she couldn't afford the $20 to pay for her mom's boat rental, but she 
had made her mother a handbasket adorned with sea shells in honor of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really beautiful," said Leslie Spaulding, a letter carrier from 
Ventura. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; HEARING PLANNED ON WATER FEE PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura City Council will hold a hearing Monday on raising residential 
water and sewage fees by 7% in the 1994-95 fiscal year, which begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 A median city household spends about $75.25 on water and sewage every two 
months. The ordinance under consideration by the council would raise that bill 
by $4.91. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee increases would pay for higher operating costs and future water and 
sewer projects. A limited amount would also pay for a low-interest loan program 
to help businesses invest in a sanitation pre-treatment operation that would 
lower overall sanitation costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council meeting begins at 7:30 p.m. at Ventura City Hall, 501 Poli 
St., Ventura. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; 2 WWII BOMBERS TO BE DISPLAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two completely restored World War II-era bombers will land at Camarillo 
Airport on Tuesday and will be available for public tours and flights through 
Thursday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A B-17G Flying Fortress and a B-24J Liberator are scheduled to arrive 
midafternoon Tuesday with public tours beginning at 3 p.m., according to 
Ventura resident George Goodwin, a spokesman for the Massachusetts-based 
Collings Foundation, the nonprofit group that owns and operates the bombers. 
</P>
<P>
 The planes will also be available for public tours from 8:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. 
Wednesday and from 8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Thursday. Tour admission is $7. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodwin said the B-17G, named the "Nine-O-Nine," and the B-24J, called "The 
All American," are in the middle of a multi-city statewide goodwill and 
fund-raising tour. 
</P>
<P>
 While several B-17s are still in flying shape, the foundation's B-24 is the 
only known bomber of its kind still flying, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Special dawn and dusk "patrol" flights in either of the warplanes are 
available for a $300 contribution to the nonprofit foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 For flight reservations or more information, call 648-1258. J.E. MITCHELL

ROBBERY TURNS GRATITUDE TO SORROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY A. KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mother's Day meant nothing but a golden crime opportunity to the man who 
ignored a woman's pleas and stole her purse as she was buying flowers for the 
nurses taking care of her critically ill infant daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Putnam, who came here about a week ago from Portland, Ore., was held up 
early Sunday at a flower shop near Childrens Hospital, where her 8-month-old 
daughter, Cheyenne Summer, was being treated for a severe immune system 
disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 Putnam had gone to the flower shop on Vermont Avenue about 8:30 a.m. to buy a 
bouquet for the nurses when a gunman entered and robbed the florists as they 
were preparing for one of the busiest days of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the robber was leaving he approached Mrs. Putnam and demanded her purse," 
said Officer Sherry Stanley of the Los Angeles Police Department's Northeast 
Division. "Lori told him, 'Please, my baby is in the hospital and I need the 
things in my purse.' 
</P>
<P>
 "The robber pointed the gun at Mrs. Putnam and she tearfully released her 
purse." 
</P>
<P>
 Putnam said she was angry and distraught and ran after the robber, who pointed 
the gun at her again. "I decided (Cheyenne) was more important than my temper," 
and she let him escape with her money, credit cards and plane tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Putnam came to Los Angeles to donate bone marrow to her daughter, who was born 
with an immune system disorder sometimes called "boy in the bubble" disorder, 
because the patient must live in a sterile environment. The ailment was made 
famous by a Texas boy who was confined to such an environment until his death 
at age 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the transplant, Cheyenne's condition has improved to the point that 
she no longer must be kept in isolation. But she has also been diagnosed with 
cerebral palsy and was to be transferred today to a Portland hospital, Stanley 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Putnam told police that the robbery was not the only sour note in her trip. 
She was followed from the hospital to her hotel, where someone tried to break 
into her room, Stanley said.  
</P>
<P>
 Police officers didn't want Putnam to leave with a poor impression of Los 
Angeles, so they took up a collection. Anyone else wishing to contribute may 
contact the Northeast station.BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTS

OWNERS MAY TURN IN GUNS ANONYMOUSLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A monthlong plan allowing gun owners to turn in firearms at any sheriff's 
station with no questions asked -- and without revealing their identities -- 
began Sunday, and reports were that nine weapons, including two handguns, had 
been surrendered so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Sherman Block and County Supervisor Gloria Molina, co-sponsors of the 
program, said all weapons received will be melted down. 
</P>
<P>
 A Sheriff's Department spokesman said that by early Sunday afternoon, three 
stations -- Lakewood, Industry and West Hollywood -- had reported receiving 
weapons. The Sheriff's Department has long accepted guns for disposal, but 
customarily asked the owner's name. Those wishing to participate in the program 
are asked to call the sheriff's station where they plan to go and inform 
deputies that they are going to turn in a gun. The weapon should be unloaded 
and locked in the owner's trunk. At the station, gun owners are asked to let 
deputies retrieve the weapon rather than bringing it inside themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone unable to unload the bullets from a weapon should call the sheriff's 
office. A deputy will be sent out to pick it up. The program lasts through June 
8.

MAN FATALLY SHOT AFTER FIGHT WITH NEIGHBOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 31-year-old landscaper and father of three was shot and killed at a Ventura 
mobile home park early Sunday following a late-night argument with a neighbor, 
Ventura police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Vargas, who lived in the Victorian Park mobile home park just off 
Victoria Avenue near the Ventura Freeway, died from multiple gunshot wounds in 
the emergency room at Ventura County Medical Center about 2:40 a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Later Sunday, one person was shot and killed outside of a house on the 800 
block of La Canada Avenue in Oxnard. The shooting occurred about 7:45 p.m. and 
was apparently sparked by a domestic dispute, according to Oxnard police 
spokesman David Keith. Oxnard Police Cmdr. Jamie Skeeters said that 
investigators were questioning a possible suspect in connection with the 
incident. No further information on the shooting was available. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Ventura shooting, police are seeking Raul Cervantes Viveros, 46, for 
questioning in connection with the slaying of Vargas. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas is survived by his wife, Racil, three children and numerous relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments after the shooting, Viveros apparently fled in his vehicle, which was 
later found abandoned in the Wagon Wheel Road area of Oxnard, according to 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 No description of the vehicle or suspect was provided by investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses at the Vargas home late Sunday morning said the neighbor, Viveros, 
was drunk and started a fistfight with Vargas just after midnight, when Vargas 
declined to turn down music playing from the home. 
</P>
<P>
 "They started fighting and I called the police, but the police never came," 
said Racil Vargas, sitting in the living room of the modest trailer surrounded 
by family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten minutes later, (Viveros) came back with the gun and shot him," she said, 
rubbing tears from her eyes. "He killed my husband." 
</P>
<P>
 Racil Vargas said they have lived in Victorian Park for six years and never 
had any problems with neighbors in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura police investigators did not return phone calls about the case Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 A press release said officers responded to a call of a fight in progress on 
Arizona Drive in the mobile home park about 1:15 a.m., but that officers were 
unable to find a disturbance at that time. 
</P>
<P>
 But less than two minutes after officers left the area, the press release 
said, reports of shots being fired at the same location were broadcast over the 
911 system. Police then found Vargas bleeding and transported him to the 
hospital, where he died about an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said a series of gunshots broke the silence of the early morning in 
the usually quiet trailer park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard a bang-bang, then I heard a bang, bang, bang, bang, bang," said one 
resident, who did not want to give her name. "There were two shots, then a 
pause, then four or five more. It sounded like he just emptied the clip." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who said she had lived in the park for only three months, said she 
worried about violence so close to her home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 54 years old," she said. "I've lived in a lot of places, but I've never 
lived anywhere where a neighbor was killed. It's scary."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: STUDENTS GO ON AIR TO URGE CONSERVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Six Ventura County elementary students will take their messages to save water 
to the airwaves this month after they were selected as winners of the county's 
water conservation radio-script contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth- and fifth-graders throughout the county participated in the contest, 
which directed the students to use "interesting ideas or words to get people to 
listen to you." 
</P>
<P>
 Sumeet S. Mitter, a 10-year-old student in Kim Godfrey's fifth-grade class at 
Flory School in Moorpark, said he entered the contest because his teacher asked 
the entire class to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also entered because water conservation is important, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a natural resource on earth and it's there for a reason," he said. "It's 
not just there to do away with." 
</P>
<P>
 Sumeet's entry, which will be aired to call attention to May as water 
conservation month, says: 
</P>
<P>
 "California has already had enough droughts. So get into the act and turn off 
those faucets and hoses and turn those showers down. And remember, never, ever, 
waste water again. Thank you, and goodby." 
</P>
<P>
 Other contest winners were Steve Albarado and Nate C. Glyer, fourth-grade 
students at Elmhurst School in Ventura; Amber O'Neal, a fourth-grader at 
Hollywood Beach School in Oxnard; Viena Wagner, a fifth-grade student at 
Pierpont School in Ventura; and Janine Martin, a classmate of Sumeet's at Flory 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 The students recorded their messages at KXBS radio station in Ventura. Copies 
of their public service announcements were sent to stations KMDY/KMJO, 
KVEN/KHAY and KBBY/KTND for airing throughout May. JOANNA M. MILLER

GROUP SEARCHES FOR STAR APPEAL IN FIGHT AGAINST DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENT: SAVE 
OPEN SPACE'S PLEA TO HELP OPPOSE THE AHMANSON RANCH PROJECT FAILS TO STIR THE 
CELEBRITY COMMUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mary Wiesbrock is star searching. 
</P>
<P>
 The director of the environmental group Save Open Space isn't exactly out 
beating the bushes in the Hollywood Hills looking for actors and actresses. Not 
yet anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 But finding a popular celebrity -- preferably an articulate one with at least 
a fleeting interest in the environment -- to join her group's cause against the 
proposed Ahmanson Ranch development is proving harder than she thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Van Dyke, who helped in Save Open Space's effort to make Jordan Ranch 
part of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, is too busy with a 
television project to help out. Tom Selleck, who lives in Hidden Valley, hasn't 
expressed interest in the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 What about local residents Heather Locklear, Sophia Loren or Frankie Avalon? 
None of them have responded to the initial plea from Save Open Space for 
celebrity assistance. Wiesbrock began seeking celebrity help after a lawsuit to 
stop the proposed 3,050-house development at Ahmanson Ranch by her group and 
eight others was rejected in March by a Ventura County judge. The lawsuit 
contended that the development would clog the Ventura Freeway, create air 
pollution and cause adverse environmental impacts on Los Angeles County, while 
destroying open space. 
</P>
<P>
 She wrote letters to the editors of all the local papers, asking for monetary 
donations and a high-profile advocate for the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "Needed now are a big name celebrity and lots of $$$$$$ to appeal the recent 
Ventura County court decision," she wrote. "Help this last ditch effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost two months later, there have been no sympathetic stirrings in the 
Hollywood community. Wiesbrock said she thinks the star community will rally 
once they learn about the development. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to get a packet out to Robert Redford, but I just haven't had the 
time," she said. Redford might be interested, she thinks, because of his 
environmental efforts in the past and because he directed the movie "The 
Milagro Beanfield War" in which a group of poor farmers defeats a proposed 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure they all get approached everyday," she added. "But we're desperately 
looking for a celebrity. It would make our work easier. Maybe we'll try for 
Paul Newman. We just haven't been able to get to anyone. They're all so busy 
themselves and they all have publicists to go through." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem may be a lack of a clear target; Wiesbrock says it's hard 
to pin down which stars actually live near the proposed development. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of a celebrity spokesperson also appeals to Bill Bell, director of 
Mountain View Estates Owners Assn., one of the other parties in the lawsuit. He 
hopes to form a committee, including celebrities, to fight the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having them lend their presence is important," Bell said. "And there are a 
number of celebrities that live out that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Who? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I really don't know. But I've heard there are people who live out that 
way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at the other end of the county, stars have been turning out in 
droves worthy of film premieres to protect the sanctity of their Ojai homes 
from the perceived health threat of a National Weather Service radar tower. 
Their efforts have included a bowling fund-raiser in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the difference? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is a real passion about this community," said Kim 
Maxwell-Brown, organizer of the Ojai fund-raising effort and wife of actor 
Dwier Brown, who played Kevin Costner's father in the movie "Field of Dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us moved here to get away from L.A. and the dangers of living there. 
This is a small town where everybody knows each other and everything pretty 
much closes down at night. There is a great passion to keep it that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Star power is considerable, Maxwell-Brown acknowledged. Though many Ojai 
residents are putting in time and money to the effort to move the tower, people 
like singer Rickie Lee Jones, actors Larry Hagman, Scott Bakula and Mary 
Steenburgen can bring national attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Steenburgen was instrumental in getting Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) to come 
to town last week to speak against the tower. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sheer donation of her (Steenburgen) time has been the most helpful 
thing," Maxwell-Brown said. "It's really made a big difference, really helped 
us out. Most people here don't have the money or the big celebrity name that 
she has." 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai is lucky, she said. Its famous residents have helped defeat a proposal to 
put a county dump in Weldon Canyon, the development of a private golf resort 
and a petroleum plant expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 But using fame can be a "double-edged sword," she added. Somehow, the conflict 
can seem less serious when celebrities are involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had fun poked at us by people who think that everyone up here is a 
really wealthy star just worried about their big fancy homes," Maxwell-Brown 
said. "It's actually a really big mix." 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell-Brown speculated that Save Open Space has not been successful to date 
in involving celebrities with the anti-Ahmanson movement because no stars are 
aware of the cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times I've found that people just haven't been contacted," she said. 
"If people are informed, I think they do what they can." 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Maria VanderKolk, who was hand-picked as a candidate by Save 
Open Space for the supervisor's race in 1990 and then fell out with the group 
after she voted to approve a revised Ahmanson development plan, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "After how much publicity that whole thing has gotten, I can't imagine that 
there is anyone who hasn't heard something about it," VanderKolk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless there is a celebrity who might be directly impacted by the development, 
VanderKolk said she thought it unlikely that Save Open Space will have any 
luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of naive to think that someone is just going to pop up out of the 
blue," she said. "You kind of need to have some connections there. If you just 
put a letter in the paper, I don't think anyone is going to respond. I 
certainly admire them for their tenacity. But as far as a celebrity is 
concerned, well, what they really need more than anything is money." 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson spokeswoman Mary Trigg said she did not know whether a celebrity 
spokesperson for the opponents would affect the fate of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what a celebrity would necessarily do for any of the groups," 
Trigg said. "Maybe someone who could speak to it from some sort of emotion, 
someone who would be believable because they really had those feelings. But I 
don't know enough about it to know whether it really helps in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, Trigg said, the company is focusing on litigation. The nine groups 
that lost the Ventura lawsuit have until May 27 to file appeals. Three of them 
-- the city of Calabasas, the Mountain View Estate Owners Assn. and the city of 
Los Angeles -- have already filed appeals. The others, according to Bell, will 
also appeal by the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiesbrock said she has other hopes for stopping the development. She is 
lobbying for the passage of the $2-billion California Parks and Wildlife Bond 
issue, Proposition 180, on the June ballot, which she said would give the state 
park service the money to buy the Ahmanson Ranch and turn it into permanent 
open space. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Redford should ride in on a white horse . . .

DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS TO APPEAR ON U.S. AUTOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE McKESSON, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To a mid-afternoon visitor from the United States, the streets of Ontario's 
Motor City might seem strangely aglow. 
</P>
<P>
 The sky is shadow-casting bright, but on car after car, headlights shine. It's 
not funeral, convoy or custom; it's Canadian law. And the phenomenon, if not 
the law, is coming to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Cars and trucks sold in Canada since the 1990 model year have been required to 
have "daytime running lights," known as DRLs. Their headlights shine at low 
intensity whenever their engines are running. On some cars, DRLs are separate 
from the headlights. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers of earlier models aren't required to keep the lights on. 
</P>
<P>
 The theory is that the lights help prevent collisions by making the vehicles 
easier to see. 
</P>
<P>
 "The research on whether or not daytime running lights are effective is 
mixed," said Ed Lechtzin, director of legal and safety issues for General 
Motors Corp. "But we think there's enough evidence at this point to show that 
it . . . makes vehicles more visible to other drivers." 
</P>
<P>
 That seems obvious to Cheryl Ann Leyland, a Windsor resident whose 1992 Dodge 
Spirit has daytime running lights. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a good idea, especially on a two-lane highway when you're passing 
into oncoming traffic," Leyland said. 
</P>
<P>
 GM announced in February that it will build daytime running lights into more 
than half a million 1995 cars and trucks. The public will first notice them on 
Chevrolet Corsicas and Berettas, S-series pickups and Geo Metros, Lechtzin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1997 model year, all new GM cars and trucks will travel U.S. roads with 
lights shining in the daytime. 
</P>
<P>
 Some U.S. industry and safety officials say the theory needs more testing. And 
some suggest that GM's motivation is sales, not safety, at a time when air 
bags, anti-lock brakes and built-in child seats are touted in new-car 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Lechtzin acknowledged that GM hopes the feature will help sell cars. "Safety 
is a marketable commodity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Transport Canada, the Canadian government's transportation agency, expects to 
release results of a study of DRL effects next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Welbourne, chief of vehicle systems for the agency, wouldn't discuss 
specific details. But he said the research found that daytime running lights 
have reduced the number of two-vehicle daylight traffic accidents in which the 
vehicles are traveling in different directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Swedish auto maker Saab has been building its cars with DRLs since 1968 but 
disconnecting the lights for the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
 Swedish studies found that DRLs reduced the number of some types of crashes by 
as much as 20%, Welbourne said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. industry and government officials, though, have been reluctant to rely on 
such studies because they have been relatively small and because the 
Scandinavian countries' northern location means that during much of the year, 
dusk comes early and dawn comes late. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler and Ford Motor Co., like GM, have been building DRL-equipped vehicles 
for sale in Canada since 1989. But neither is ready to immediately follow the 
lead of the No. 1 auto maker. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing a marketing study to see how customers will react," said Robert 
H. Munson, executive director of Ford's safety and engineering standards 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Edwards, manager of regulatory safety at Chrysler, said that Chrysler 
market research shows no strong demand for DRLs and even some concern that 
consumers might dislike them. 
</P>
<P>
 Other potential negatives include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Glare. This, though, shouldn't be a problem with current technology, auto 
maker and government officials say. Modern DRLs use a vehicle's 
lighting-control computer to burn the filament of the headlights' high beams 
but at a much-reduced intensity. That should eliminate burnout and glare 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cost. None of the auto makers will give exact estimates, but GM's Lechtzin 
says the cost per vehicle would be under $10. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fuel economy. Adding options that use power means a car burns more gasoline. 
But Brian O'Neill, president of the research group Insurance Institute for 
Highway Safety, says that DRLs reduce fuel economy only "a fraction of a mile 
per gallon."

O.C. JAZZ REVIEW; STYLES ARE THEIR UMBRELLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was sometime during drummer Ralph Penland's mid-afternoon performance of 
Herbie Hancock's blustery "Eye of the Hurricane" when the sun broke through the 
clouds to shine on the Southern California Jazz Festival. It was a nicely 
ironic touch for Saturday's edition of the fest, held on two stages between 
high-rises and the San Diego freeway on the grounds of the Koll Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, the weather situation had been touch and go. Friday's opening 
installment of the three-day event ended prematurely under an early evening 
downpour. Saturday's schedule looked like it might suffer the same fate. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, the dark clouds stayed to the south and north. And despite breezy 
conditions, unseasonably cool temperatures and further threats of rain after 
the sun went down, the festival's first complete day kept its musical promise. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the overall lineup weighed in heavily on the side of beat-driven, 
contemporary sounds, Saturday's schedule provided enough contrast to interest 
even the most-jaded listeners. Mixed in with the synthesizer wash, booming bass 
and the whine of electric guitars were mainstream jazz combos, a New 
Orleans-styled piano professor and a cabaret vocalist.  
</P>
<P>
 If that weren't enough, one could always wander away from the stages to peruse 
the wares of arts and craft dealers as well as sample foods from 17 area 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the bands was able to stir the crowd, estimated by this reviewer at no 
more than 2,000 during its peak, into a dance-party frenzy as seems to happen 
at least once each day at the annual Playboy Festival in the Hollywood Bowl. 
Maybe fans were too comfortable wrapped in blankets and ensconced on their lawn 
chairs to get up and boogie. But there were a number of musical highlights. 
</P>
<P>
 The day's most entertaining set came from A.J. Croce, the son of the late 
singer-songwriter Jim Croce. Seated at the grand piano, Croce has the good, 
slick-backed looks of Harry Connick Jr., but, unlike Connick, his musical view 
looks to low, rather than high, society. Backed by a three-piece horn section, 
guitar bass and drums, Croce spun tales, sang the blues and played rollicking, 
barrel-house styled piano. He preluded almost all of his numbers with a clever 
story tagged with the line, "and it feels something like this."  
</P>
<P>
 The most amazing thing about Croce is his voice, a gruff, serious instrument 
that sounds as if it might come from someone much older. His well-paced 
delivery on the seasoned standard "Trouble in Mind" reflected more dues paying 
than someone of his 22 years has probably seen. 
</P>
<P>
 At the piano, Croce is a blend of Art Tatum and Jerry Lee Lewis, mixing 
jazz-inspired lines with trills and glissandi. His band is equally dexterous, 
featuring fine contributions from pocket trumpeter Mitch Manker, saxophonist 
Paco Shipp (who also added some virtuosic harmonica work) and 
saxophonist-clarinetist Evan Christopher, who's been seen around Orange County 
leading his own Dixieland-flavored band. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After Croce, keyboardist Daniel Ho's fusion band Kilauea offered an 
easy-to-take array of rhythmically accessible tunes. Ho is a composer with an 
ear for the melodic, and he stuck mostly to acoustic piano, giving, at times, a 
chamber group feel to particularly geometric numbers, especially those that 
included Greg Vail's flute. 
</P>
<P>
 On saxophone, Vail served as the band's fireplug, heating up the tunes each 
time he took a solo turn. His work on Ho's "Bedroom Eyes" -- during a solo that 
found him playing on his knees -- was especially invigorating. 
</P>
<P>
 Closing act Richard Elliot also got down on his knees to play his tenor sax. 
The former Tower of Power horn section man applied strong R & B chops to his 
beat-minded selections, playing aggressively with a bit of raunch here and 
there, or working with warmth and intimacy as he did on "I'm Not in Love." He 
closed his own "Take Your Time" with an extended winding down that found his 
hard-edged attack softening into a series of sputters and reverb. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliot's guitarist, Richard Smith, took advantage of the set to show off his 
strong rhythm chops and high-powered way of improvising. Earlier in the day, 
leading his own quintet, Smith showed a preference for the prettier side of 
contemporary jazz, working with sensitivity during his own "From My Window" and 
when backing smoothly toned vocalist Lynn Scott in the ballad "Consider This 
Love." 
</P>
<P>
 The festival ran close to schedule, falling 15 to 30 minutes behind as the 
evening wore on. Sound from the main stage, despite the white noise generated 
by the freeway, was passable if not perfect. But sound from the second stage 
was uneven, marred by bad balance and variations in volume. Though the weather 
held down attendance, this is an event that deserves a repeat performance in 
front of larger audiences next year. 
</P>
<P>
 In a break for drummer Penland's Penland Polygon, the group was moved from the 
small, second stage and its uneven sound to the main stage. Penland, who has 
worked with Hancock, Freddie Hubbard and a host of others during his career, 
seized the opportunity. He delivered a strong set of standards and originals 
with his quintet that featured bassist Robert Hurst III, who's seen with 
Branford Marsalis' "Tonight Show" band. 
</P>
<P>
 Penland's group is inspired by Miles Davis' mid-1960s period, and they 
presented palatable versions of tunes from that era, notably "Eye of the 
Hurricane," Wayne Shorter's "Paraphernalia" and Joe Henderson's "Caribbean Fire 
Dance."  
</P>
<P>
 Though Penland, with his rolling tom-tom passages and assured way of building 
over the changes, was easily the group's standout, fine improvisations were 
also heard from Hurst, saxophonist Gerald Pinter and pianist Greg Kirstin. 
Trumpeter Charles Moore often sounded more like Miles Davis than Miles himself, 
offering up a gaggle of clinkers, smeared, off-pitch tones and, on Thelonious 
Monk's "'Round Midnight," muted, sometime choked trumpet musings. 
</P>
<P>
 The day's opening act, The Blue Moon Jazz Trio with vocalist Maryanne Reall, 
pianist Bob Stevens and bassist Frank Garcia, delivered a cabaret set of 
standards, including "Blue Moon" that was marred by the buzz of traffic blowing 
by on the freeway. (This was a daylong problem on the main stage, which only 
the strongly amplified groups seemed able to overcome.) Bassist and airborne 
reporter Jennifer York's quartet gave a trim presentation that spanned 
mainstream (Cedar Walton's "Bolivia") and modern (David Sanborn's "Love Is Not 
Enough.") 
</P>
<P>
 York is an enthusiastic player of both upright and electric basses and has 
surrounded herself with a group of like-minded musicians that features 
saxophonist Janine Del Arte. The group showed its mettle on Don Grolnick's 
"Nothing Personal," the modal workout made popular by saxophonist Michael 
Brecker. Their rhythmic savvy came across on Sonny Rollins' "St. Thomas," which 
featured York's Latin-tinged electric bass propulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, saxophonist Sonya Jason's quartet continues to tighten up its act. 
Jason's brand of beat-heavy, melodically inspired tunes were executed in 
muscular style, thanks to the firm work of drummer Dave Anderson and bassist 
Ernest Tibbs. There were times during her set that Jason seemed to be playing 
catch-up with her insistent rhythm section, but she won the crowd over with 
warm, occasionally hot expression on both alto and soprano instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bassist Brian Bromberg's appearance was filled with plenty of his technical 
flash, but little of musical interest. Bromberg treats his electric basses like 
a guitar, so much so that a second bassist is included in the group to keep the 
bottom solid. There's no doubt that Bromberg is a master. His up-neck play, 
tapped out with finger from both hands, is especially amazing, but he could 
stand to bring some of the lyricism that he evokes on the upright to his 
electric work. 
</P>
<P>
 Local drummer Evan Stone and guitarist Gannin Arnold have found their format 
with their new band Departure, a quintet that includes keyboardist John 
Opferkuch, percussionist Jason Hann and bassist Bill Urson. The ensemble made 
its best showing on original material, with Arnold's John Scofield-flavored 
guitar working as the principal voice and exchanges between Hann, on congas, 
and Stone spicing up the mix. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival's Sunday schedule included Keiko Matsui, John Patitucci and 
Patrice Rushen and Ndugu Chancler.

POP REVIEW; HERSH FINDS HOME AT COACH HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is no denying Kristin Hersh's bona fides in the alternative rock 
universe. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether edgy and electric with her band, Throwing Muses, or quietly intimate 
on her recent acoustic solo debut, "Hips and Makers," she has never been less 
than intense while plugging into the emotional currents that flow through 
troubled homes and tormented minds. 
</P>
<P>
 But the prospect of Hersh playing solo-acoustic, as she did Friday at the 
Coach House, seemed a little daunting. In fronting Throwing Muses since the 
mid-1980s, she has been an austere figure, caught up in the psychodramas of her 
songs and not one for the audience-engagement that is virtually essential for a 
rewarding solo concert. 
</P>
<P>
 Given her heavy subject matter, and the fact that her symbolic, fragmentary 
lyrics typically render literal meanings obscure (even as her performances make 
vivid the feelings underlying them), an evening of unadorned Hersh songs held 
great potential for claustrophobia. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, there was no need to worry. Hersh the singer-guitarist was 
as intense as ever, but Hersh the hostess proved to be a spontaneous and richly 
comic raconteur who gave the show the lighter dimension it needed to succeed.  
</P>
<P>
 She spun imaginative tall tales, made wry observations about life in the music 
business, and thoroughly charmed her fans with warm, funny stories about her 
2-year-old son, Ryder, that struck a perfect balance between the affections of 
a doting mom and the crusty humor of someone who isn't about to sentimentalize 
what it's like to be the parent of a terrible-2.  
</P>
<P>
 In short, Hersh took advantage of the intimate format to open up in a direct, 
disarming way that gave her performance an entirely new dimension. At the same 
time, it reassured an audience that, faced with the starkness of her songs and 
the feelings in them, might otherwise have felt as if it were intruding in 
touchy precincts where it didn't belong. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hersh didn't pull any emotional punches. Her 16-song set drew heavily upon 
"Hips and Makers" but also encompassed some Muses material, including a couple 
of obscure B-sides and one new song, "Gazebo Tree." The husky crone's-bark of 
alarm, the small, nervous tremor of isolation, the insistent call of yearning, 
the weary, diminished voice of one put too many times through the wringer -- 
all of Hersh's vivid devices for translating raw feeling into song -- were in 
effect.  
</P>
<P>
 She supported them with precise, attentive guitar playing that maintained 
interest with unorthodox chord patterns, well-executed single-note lines, and 
passages that showed an assured touch with traditional, Appalachian-style 
folk-guitar picking. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire set held the audience of about 200 in rapt attention, but it could 
have benefited from more diversity of musical mood and color. Hersh's extensive 
catalogue doesn't offer many instances of lighthearted good-feeling, but she 
can draw on many strong songs with surging rhythms or purely lovely melodies -- 
two ways of introducing more variety. 
</P>
<P>
 Hersh gave fine renderings of such "Hips and Makers" highlights as the gutsy, 
powerful declaration "Me and My Charms" and the darkly meditative "Your Ghost." 
But she omitted the airy "Bee-stung" and the dreamy "Velvet Days," two alluring 
"Hips and Makers" songs that could have lent some needed contrast. 
"Cottonmouth," a wry, vigorous song in which sexual desire overrides the 
narrator's better judgment about a man's dubious character, drew the show's 
strongest burst of applause, suggesting that the audience would have been 
grateful for a few more musical sallies out from the shadows. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Hersh's performance opened great new possibilities. Having made a 
respected name with a method based in uncompromising abstraction, perhaps she 
can now apply this previously hidden gift for engaging narrative storytelling 
to her songwriting. That might be a tad conventional for a Throwing Muse, but 
there is nothing more conventional than spiking somber material with the fizz 
of between-songs humor, the oldest trick in the solo-folkie book. Hersh honored 
it, with marvelous results. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Opening act Pooka seemed at first glance like the last thing the rock world 
needs: two more shy, waif-like girl-singers applying airy, small voices to a 
litany of boyfriend problems. But the acoustic duo from Manchester, England, 
quickly revealed there is more to it than that. 
</P>
<P>
 In the course of their 40-minute set, Sharon Lewis and Natasha Jones coiled 
voices in expert close-harmony like a couple of Roches, projected some of the 
dizzy whimsicality of the '60s hippie folk duo, the Incredible String Band, and 
mustered some spine and bite, both in their occasional rocking rhythms 
(courtesy of Lewis, a solid guitarist) and a no-nonsense attitude toward 
matters of romance.  
</P>
<P>
 The set's strongest song, "City Sick," was a bluesy number that recalled Rod 
Stewart's "Gasoline Alley" period. 
</P>
<P>
 The duo, named for a mischievous type of haunting spirit (James Stewart's 
giant invisible rabbit buddy in "Harvey" is probably the world's best-known 
pooka), recently released its debut album on Elektra Records. In their songs, 
Lewis and Jones were especially refreshing in their ability to be gently frank 
and open about sexual desire without resorting to shock-value tactics or 
seeming to be striving for some major declaration about the ascendancy of 
liberated women in rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Shy and awkward as they seemed, the two were hams at heart. Their unguarded 
reactions to such signs of approval as a bouquet of roses from a chivalrous 
gent in the audience were a big part of the set's charm.  
</P>
<P>
 Given a shot, Pooka could be capable of drawing big, bright pooka dots on the 
fashionably sullen face of '90s rock.

 Seriousness of purpose and musical penetration marked the collaboration of 
violinist Cho-Liang Lin and pianist Andre-Michel Schub, Saturday night at 
Irvine Barclay Theatre, from their choice of program to the way they played it, 
right through to the encores that followed. 
</P>
<P>
 They also seem, musically, to know each other very well.Together since 1980, 
the duo offered strongly integrated performances of ostensible violin sonatas 
that all but erased the distinction between soloist and accompanist. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, like a married couple stealing each other's punch lines, Lin and Schub 
often completed each other's musical thoughts without a break in stride. This 
was especially pronounced in their reading of Beethoven's Sonata, Opus 30, No. 
1, which unwound conversationally and easily, and with all its warmth, detail 
and joy intact. 
</P>
<P>
 In Prokofiev's brooding and muscular Sonata, Opus 80, they combined for a 
performance symphonic in grandeur and color, and unflagging in intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, elegance was always nearby. Lin seems not to know the 
meaning of overstatement, and his technique and tone never show signs of effort 
or strain. This let him capture the fluttery, fleeting world of Debussy's 
G-minor Sonata with the requisite force and lightness while not calling 
attention to his own prowess. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Ravel's Sonata, the players' complete equality found a perfect match in the 
composer's stratified dialogue, yet they never failed to remember the big 
picture and built compelling dramatic arches. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the encores, Elgar's "Salut d'amour" and Milhaud/Heifetz "Brasileira," 
normally bonbons, sounded more serious than usual, in carefully etched, 
technically polished accounts.

FIGHTING CRIME ON DOORSTEP OF GOVERNMENT; CIVIC CENTER: SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES NOW 
PATROL THE HALL OF ADMINISTRATION AND HUTTON TOWERS COMPLEXES DURING RUSH HOURS 
TO SHIELD WORKERS FROM THE 'GANTLET OF THUGS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Orange County officials have stepped up security police patrols around the 
Civic Center government complex to provide additional protection for hundreds 
of employees and visitors who are increasingly crossing the path of gunfire and 
other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County sheriff's deputies now patrol the Hall of Administration and 
Hutton Towers complexes during morning and afternoon rush hours to shield 
workers from the "gantlet of thugs" that prey on workers as they travel to and 
from their offices, County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, Sheriff's Capt. Bill Miller said, gang-related violence has 
spilled out into the streets in the shadow of the Sheriff's Department and 
officers have found pockmarks left by flying bullets at the county's Hutton 
complex, across from the Civic Center at Santa Ana Boulevard and Flower Street. 
"We certainly don't think they are targeting people inside," Miller said of the 
bullet-hole discoveries, "but it's enough to cause some concern." 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of government employees also have complained in recent months of being 
accosted and shaken down for money as they have walked to their office 
buildings from adjacent parking areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen drug deals going down looking just outside my window," said County 
Supervisor William G. Steiner, whose office sits on the fifth-floor of the Hall 
of Adminstration. "It's more than just a problem with vagrants." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, officials with the county Marshal's Office said Friday that they 
are considering recommendations from state court authorities to install 
electronic screening devices at the entrances of the courthouse in the Civic 
Center, and also at the other courthouses in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Marshal Jim Hill said the neighborhood criminal element was not a 
factor in the consideration. Rather, he said, court administrators in 
Sacramento have heard concerns from judges about the lack of detection systems 
in places that naturally draw people involved in criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 At the county's Juvenile Justice Center in Orange, the only court facility in 
the county equipped with electronic screening, marshals are continually 
detecting visitors armed with knives, brass knuckles, pepper spray or Mace, 
Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't catch that in Santa Ana because we don't have the equipment there," 
Hill said. "Some judges are amazed that we're not already doing this." 
</P>
<P>
 The recent security concerns, however, have been prompted by the complaints 
from county government workers who say their walks to and from nearby parking 
structures have sometimes become frightening experiences, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the Civic Center has been a gathering spot for the homeless, but 
county and sheriff's officials say the crime concerns have escalated because a 
more serious criminal element has moved into the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have people who had been pushed and shoved and have had things taken away 
from them," Schneider said. "It a real problem. . . . We've had to bring in the 
extra security and take additional precautions." 
</P>
<P>
 One of those precautions, Schneider said, arranging closer parking for female 
employees and others who expressed concerns so that they would not have to walk 
long distances to their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For some employees, the most troublesome area has been the approximately 
two-block walk between the Hall of Adminstration and a parking structure next 
to the Santa Ana Library, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People said they were getting shoved around and intimidated into giving away 
money," Schneider said. "It's unfortunate, but we have been trying to do 
everything we can to make our employees feel safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Miller acknowledged that various county managers have requested the 
additional security in response to employee complaints. The additional deputies 
have been dispatched to the Hall of Administration and Hutton Towers areas in 
the past 60 days.  
</P>
<P>
 The Hall of Administration is the heart of county government and includes the 
offices of the Board of Supervisors. The Hutton Towers complex includes the 
county's Environmental Management Agency offices, Integrated Waste Management 
Agency and sheriff's Forensic Sciences Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The Civic Center, located between Santa Ana Boulevard and Civic Center Drive, 
also houses Santa Ana city government offices, the federal courthouse and other 
federal and state government offices.  
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department sits across the street from the Civic Center on 
Flower Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Miller said that concerns about violence and shootings within steps of 
the government complex have increased in the past year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, a daylight attack outside the Sheriff's Department headquarters sent 
people scrambling for cover when assailants pounced on a man and clubbed him 
with a tire iron before firing guns in the area. No one was struck by the 
gunfire, and the injured man, blood dripping from his head, wandered into the 
nearby lobby of the Men's Central Jail looking for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, whose North County command includes security inside county government 
buildings, said deputies also were on alert earlier this year when stray 
gunfire flew outside the rear entry of the jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Again no one was injured, and Miller said he believed the gunfire was part of 
an exchange between rival neighborhoods in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county Civic Center area has matured like any other metro area over the 
years," Miller said, "and you pick up the same kinds of problems of people 
pollution that happen everywhere else."

SDS RESURFACES, THIS TIME FOR A NEW GENERATION; POLITICS: HUNTINGTON BEACH 
STUDENT STARTS CHAPTER OF 1960S PROTEST GROUP TO FOCUS ON FREEDOM OF 
EXPRESSION. BUT DON'T CALL MEMBERS HIPPIES OR FLOWER CHILDREN, DESPITE THE 
LIBERAL BENT.

 "We are the people of this generation, bred in at least modest comfort, housed 
now in universities, looking uncomfortably to the world we inherit." -- Excerpt 
from the Port Huron Statement, issued by the Students for a Democratic Society 
in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 John Hobbs wasn't even born when the Students for a Democratic Society issued 
their Angst- ridden radical manifesto in the 1960s. A child of the Reagan era, 
Hobbs is a freshman at Huntington Beach High School. 
</P>
<P>
 But within the comfortable, conservative cradle of Orange County, 15-year-old 
Hobbs has started his own Students for a Democratic Society chapter because he 
doesn't like what he sees when he looks toward the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Hobbs and his partner, 14-year-old Mindy Nettifee, run weekly lunchtime 
meetings for teen-agers with a liberal bent. On good days, their group is 20 to 
30 members strong, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that even in Orange County I wouldn't be the only one who wanted a 
group like this," said Hobbs, poised on a chair at a smoky Huntington Beach 
coffeehouse on a recent afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 SDS dates back to the decade of "Make Love, Not War" and Flower Power; it 
comes from a dissident student group founded in the early 1960s by Tom Hayden 
and fellow students at the University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Hobbs read about the group -- which splintered and faded -- in a book on 1960s 
radical politics and was inspired to start his own new New Left, he says.  
</P>
<P>
 "I found out that that group supported civil rights and liberal thought, so 
why not?" Hobbs said.  
</P>
<P>
 The group has run into some roadblocks, though. School administrators haven't 
recognized it as an official club. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach Union High School District's equal-access policy allows 
religious and other student groups to meet before and after school and during 
lunch in classrooms. The groups, including SDS, are not recognized as official 
school clubs because they are not related to school curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 Only official clubs may invite speakers to campus. When Hobbs and Co. wanted 
to invite current California gubernatorial candidate Hayden to speak, their 
hands were tied, they say, and they had to drop the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden has not had contact with the group, but said he is honored that 
students would appropriate the name. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every generation invents its forms of protest anew," Hayden said, "and I hope 
they're focusing on their future." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that young people live in a different time now -- students 18 and 
older can vote, and the economy is worse, making issues of educational 
affordability much more important. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a youth movement now that's outside of politics," Hayden 
says. "It's mainly in culture, music and lifestyle . . . politics doesn't 
provide enough meaning" for most. 
</P>
<P>
 SDS members say their focus of protest is dress codes -- something Hayden 
protested when he was younger -- and they recently appeared on a UC 
Irvine-based alternative radio show to discuss them. 
</P>
<P>
 They turn thumbs down on a bill working its way through the state Legislature 
that would let public schools impose dress codes requiring uniforms. They 
particularly scorn new additions to their own school district's dress code. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clothing for high school students is a form of expression," said Nettifee, 
wearing jeans and black, clunky Mary Janes. "For some, the only way they can 
express themselves is that way. It's hard enough for teen-agers to express 
themselves anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Their school district's code bars clothes with a sexual tone, including tank 
tops and shirts with obscene or offensive slogans. Adopted in April, the code 
also bars clothes with spikes or chains, as well as belt buckles with "gang 
symbols." Tattoos are also a no-no, although a committee at each school in the 
district can interpret which parts of the code to enforce. 
</P>
<P>
 Hobbs and his friends began passing out flyers on campus with the text of the 
code before it was passed, reading: "If this makes you angry, come to an SDS 
meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 He says it didn't win him friends in the school administration. They stopped 
members from distributing them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were handing out a flyer that contained language that I think 
potentially could've upset a lot of students and people," Huntington Beach High 
Principal Jim Staunton said. "I told them much of what they wrote was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Staunton said SDS members assumed the dress code was "a blanket thrown over 
every student in the district. . . . They set out to protest something before 
they knew all the facts." 
</P>
<P>
 He says he neither approves nor disapproves of the group. "It's a matter of 
exercising their rights -- they have a right to exist," Staunton said, before 
adding that members seem to be "bright kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Freedom of expression is the new SDS's mantra. Around a table at Midnight 
Espresso recently, Hobbs and Nettifee discussed protesting what they believe 
are infringements of their freedom, including strict curfews for youths in 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair say they aren't looking for confrontation, though.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a pacifist," Hobbs declared. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he believes in making his point other ways. Because he thinks women 
should not feel pressured to wear makeup, for example, Hobbs once went to 
school done up in eye shadow and lipstick. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their liberal line, don't call Hobbs or Nettifee wanna-be hippies. 
</P>
<P>
 "In no way do I want to be a hippie, or a person from the '60s," Hobbs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nettifee chimes in. "My mom was not a hippie, she was not an activist," she 
said. "All her friends went to Woodstock and she didn't even go." 
</P>
<P>
 They say they hope that through their group they can provide a way for young 
people with similar views in Orange County to discuss democracy and the future 
of their generation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too many people don't ask questions or find out things for themselves," 
Nettifee said. "I think being a liberal is about being able to search out the 
truth." An SDS Primer HISTORY

MOON HAS STARRING ROLE; PARTIAL SOLAR ECLIPSE ON TUESDAY WILL BE THE LAST 
VISIBLE IN COUNTY UNTIL THE NEXT CENTURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the height of the morning rush hour Tuesday,the shadow of the moon will 
race across Orange County in the last solar eclipse to be visible to county 
residents for the rest of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost everyone in North America will have a chance to watch the moon 
partially eclipse the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a fairly good alignment for people in Orange County because the moon 
will cover a significant portion of the sun, whereas if you were (300 miles) 
farther north, it would be almost imperceptible," said Jeff Sloan, an eclipse 
buff of Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 But, weather permitting, those watching from within a narrow band 150 miles 
wide, running from Baja California through southern New Mexico to northern New 
England, will see an even rarer sky spectacle: an annular eclipse in which the 
moon will blot out all but the sun's fiery rim, creating a kind of golden solar 
wedding band. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a celestial portent in February, 1831, reportedly inspired Nat Turner, 
who led America's largest slave rebellion.  
</P>
<P>
 Several county eclipse buffs, including John Sanford, president of Orange 
County Astronomers, have traveled as far as Morocco to experience the maximum 
effect, which will occur there at sunset. In Orange County, at the height of 
the partial eclipse Tuesday, almost three-fourths of the sun will be blotted 
out at 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Morning sunshine will turn to twilight. As the source of light in the sky 
shrinks, shadows will sharpen. In the shade of leafy trees, the ground will be 
dappled with hundreds of bright, dancing crescents caused by the eclipse, as 
overlapping leaves form a profusion of natural pinhole projectors. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as astronomers in general are concerned, most eclipses are not of 
great scientific value, but they are of great aesthetic value and great 
emotional value," said Griffith Observatory Director Edwin C. Krupp.  
</P>
<P>
 In all, the eclipse here will last about 2 hours and 45 minutes, beginning at 
7:44 a.m. and ending at 10:29 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "You will have the thinnest crescent sun that we will see for the duration of 
the century," Krupp said. "One could even say it was just like the crescent 
moon if it were not so bright and so dangerous to view directly."  
</P>
<P>
 Astronomers warn that anyone looking directly at the eclipse risks serious eye 
damage unless they use proper safety filters, such as No. 14 welder's goggles 
or special solar Mylar filters. Parents should keep young children from looking 
at the sun. Even though most of the sun's light will be blocked, the remaining 
sunlight is still too intense to be viewed even briefly. The retina of the eye 
has no pain receptors, so the damage can happen without warning. 
</P>
<P>
 People can safely view the eclipse indirectly by projecting its image through 
a pinhole camera or by reflecting it with a pocket mirror onto a shaded wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the eclipse will take place during rush hour, Caltrans is not 
worried. Spokesman Vincent Moreno said Caltrans data indicates that motorists 
-- who appear to be willing to slow down and gawk at almost anything -- 
actually are rather picky when it comes to rubbernecking and generally will 
slow only for phenomena in their immediate line of vision. The last eclipse did 
not cause a celestial gawkers block, he said, because commuters would have had 
to look up to see it. 
</P>
<P>
 A solar eclipse occurs somewhere around the world two to five times a year. It 
happens when the moon moving in its orbit around the Earth slips in between the 
planet and the star that lights it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the sun's diameter is about 400 times that of the moon, it also is 
almost 400 times farther away from the Earth, so that the two appear about the 
same size when viewed from Earth. Most eclipses are only partial, because the 
moon and sun are not perfectly in phase. 
</P>
<P>
 When the moon is at the farthest reaches of its orbit, it can cause an annular 
eclipse when it passes in front of the sun because its disk is slightly smaller 
than that of the sun, as seen from Earth.  
</P>
<P>
 The last annular eclipse visible in the region occurred two years ago -- a 
rare late-afternoon eclipse that, for those lucky enough to experience clear 
skies, combined the ring of solar fire with the colors of sunset. Tuesday's 
event will be the last time people in the United States will see an annular 
eclipse for 18 years.  
</P>
<P>
 Not until May 20, 2012, will the moon again appear to pass within the sun, as 
viewed from the Western United States, and it will be another seven years after 
that before the moon completely blocks the sun from view. Darkness in the 
Morning Rush-hour commuters will be treated to a partial eclipse of the sun 
beginning at 7:44 a.m. Tuesday. In Orange County at the height of the eclipse, 
the sun will be 72% covered. It is the last eclipse visible in Southern 
California for the rest of this century. 
</P>
<P>
 Comparing Views: 
</P>
<P>
 The trademark solar ring will be visible in El Paso, which is almost directly 
centered on the path of annularity, Other cities along the path, such as St. 
Louis, will see an offset ring. The ring is visible only momentarily. 
</P>
<P>
 From Southern California, the sun will be about three-fourths covered, with 
coverage increasing toward the southernmost part of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Annular vs. Total Eclipses: 
</P>
<P>
 In an annular eclipse, the moon is silhouetted briefly in front of the sun but 
is too far from Earth and can completely blot out the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Eclipse Schedule: 
</P>
<P>
 5:56 a.m.: Sunrise 
</P>
<P>
 7:44 a.m.: Eclipse begins. The moon begins to move in front of the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 9 a.m.: Maximum eclipse. the moon covers 72% of the sun's surface. 
</P>
<P>
 10:29 a.m.: Eclipse ends. Moon leaves the face of the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Avoiding Eye Injury: 
</P>
<P>
 Any eclipse, even a total one, has the potential to cause eye injury because 
the visible sunlight is still far too intense even for brief glances, Here are 
some tips: 
</P>
<P>
 Create a pinhole camera by making a tiny hole in a sheet of heavy paper and 
using it to project the sun's image onto a second sheet of paper held below. 
The image is faint but discernible. 
</P>
<P>
 Use a pocket mirror to reflect the sun's image onto the shaded wall of a 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 Hang out with the experts. The Griffith Observatory will be open from 7 a.m. 
Specially fitted telescopes will be provided by the observatory. Sources:

 In honor of Mother's Day, children opened Sunday Mass in the chapel at El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station by laying flowers at the base of a charred wooden 
statue of Mother Mary, then distributed the flowers to their own mothers as 
services concluded.  
</P>
<P>
 It was the third consecutive year that Mother's Day Mass centered on the 
scorched Madonna statue, which had incredibly survived the fiery crash of a 
small privately owned airplane that struck power lines and plunged into the 
base's chapel on April 27, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash, which took the lives of the plane's civilian pilot and his 
passenger, demolished the chapel, which was empty at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The only artifact salvaged from the inferno was the wooden Madonna, badly 
burned but intact. 
</P>
<P>
 The Madonna, scarred from the flames but protected by a layer of lacquer, can 
be seen in the chapel during most Catholic services, according to Mary Lou 
Miller, director of religious education at the base. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Madonna has become the centerpiece of services to simultaneously honor 
parishioners' mothers and the mother of Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great," said Julie Kennedy, 13-year-old daughter of Barbara and Lt. Col. 
Robert Kennedy. "The kids get to know about the Blessed Mother and get to honor 
her on this date. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it shows appreciation to my mother for all the things she's done." 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't easy being a parent," Julie pointed out. "It's hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Conducting the services was Father Chris Heath, visiting priest from Tustin's 
St. Cecilia Catholic Church.  
</P>
<P>
 In 2,000 years, Father Heath noted, many religious pictures and statues have 
miraculously survived despite plundering barbarians and other catastrophes.  
</P>
<P>
 The El Toro Madonna has taken on a regional significance by bringing an 
immediacy to such stories for the local parishioners, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This, I think, has a lot of religious importance to people," Father Heath 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parishioner Cindy Fox agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "To look at the statue is kind of eerie," said Fox, who is married to Marine 
Corps Maj. Ray Fox.  
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Fox said she got involved with the Mother's Day tradition at the chapel 
by making the flowered wreaths for the Madonna's head. 
</P>
<P>
 When she and her husband returned to the El Toro base after being stationed 
out of the country for a year, she was delighted to find that the custom of 
bringing flowers for the Madonna had continued. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 boys and girls participated Sunday, each carrying flowers they had 
brought from home to place on the base of the statue as services began. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, at the conclusion of the Mass, Father Heath invited the children to 
return to the statue near the altar "in honor of all of those of you who are 
mothers." 
</P>
<P>
 Queues of daintily dressed girls and fresh-faced boys formed to pick out 
flowers at the feet of the statue, then returned the pews to give the gifts to 
their mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is kind of a neat way to honor our mothers on Mother's Day," said Cindy 
Fox, whose daughter was among the children bearing flowers Sunday.

MEN OF STEEL; IRONWORKERS FIXING FREEWAYS ENDURE FATIGUE OF GRUELING HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's midnight in the shadows of a deserted freeway underpass and ironworker 
Fred (Coco) Smith is slouched behind the wheel of his Buick Riviera -- waiting 
to report to work for the 30th consecutive day, talking in a trance-like voice 
about what it's like to be drop-dead, running-on-empty tired. 
</P>
<P>
 "You feel like you're already dead," he is saying, his fingers lazily 
wandering the radio dial for a bit of the blues. "Your eyes have cement shades 
and you're so sluggish. Your feet weigh 1,000 pounds each, like you're walking 
underwater." 
</P>
<P>
 Since January's massive Northridge earthquake toppled numerous freeway spans 
across Los Angeles, crews of bleary-eyed construction workers have labored 
literally around the clock to put those concrete and steel Humpty Dumpties back 
together again -- enduring a fatigue factor that has ground them down like a 
car engine without oil, making them sweaty, zombie-like strangers to their own 
wives and children. 
</P>
<P>
 For Smith, a 42-year-old father of three who has spent a quarter of a century 
as an ironworker, the disaster has meant 12 successive weeks of pulling a 
grueling shift known as a 7-10 -- working seven days a week, 10 hours a day -- 
first at the Santa Monica Freeway and now rebuilding the Golden State-Antelope 
Valley freeway interchange. 
</P>
<P>
 From midnight to 10 a.m. -- day after day, 70 hours a week, in the rain and 
wind and darkness -- Smith and a tightknit crew of 15 other Local 416 union 
ironworkers have pulled the second leg of a nightmarish graveyard shift that 
has shaken their once-stable family lives worse than any earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they find themselves grouchy with their wives and children -- that's when 
they get to see them. They have become absentee heads of their own households, 
forsaking responsibilities at their local churches, community groups, back 
yards and bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Because, like Smith, these men in yellow hard hats and protective gloves are 
obsessed with just two things: work and sleep -- fantasizing about sleep while 
on the job and dreaming of work during their fitful daytime slumbers. 
</P>
<P>
 After working sometimes 40 days in a row, their eyelids buckle as though 
supporting two gigantic construction cranes. At times, Smith's steadily growing 
fatigue has caused him to fall asleep at the wheel of his car during the daily 
42-mile drive back home to Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 Some mornings, he plays a game of "driving-by-Braille," dozing at the wheel 
until the clunka-clunka-clunka of his tires hitting the rounded, plastic lane 
dividers lurches him back to consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 On the job, such weariness has strangely created a bond among the 15 men who 
work with Smith on the overnight crew as they mold strands of iron "rebar" into 
support structures for the soon-to-be-erected freeway bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we see a guy slacking off or complaining about the job, we'll yell at 
him," Smith says. "We'll use bad language. We'll tell the guy to quit 
sniveling, to go home if he can't do the job. Nobody wants to hear his 
complaints. We're ironworkers, like we say, 'rough and tough, hard to bluff, 
mean as a red-assed spider.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there is a sense of pride, a sense of blue-collar machismo, being part 
of this bridge construction job. These men know the public is looking over 
their shoulder, waiting for their freeway to be delivered back to them later 
this year, but at the same time wanting the job done right, ready to accept no 
excuses for slipshod workmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the owner of Tri-City Reinforcement handed out T-shirts bearing the 
Interstate 10 logo of the Santa Monica Freeway, along with the words "I was 
there." The workers flocked around the shirts like birds of prey, holding them 
up proudly. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our business, it stands for something, that fact that you worked on these 
projects," Smith says. "Because when ironworkers get together, they tell tales. 
And this job is the biggest tale of them all." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironworker Jimmy Phillips, another member of the night crew, feels as though 
the Golden State Freeway job has simultaneously plopped his big steel-toed 
construction boots into both heaven and hell. 
</P>
<P>
 He feels like some oil worker on special duty in far-flung Alaska, making more 
money than he ever dreamed possible -- grossing as much as $2,500 a week before 
taxes -- but laboring such long hours that he has no time to spend it. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a construction worker's Catch-22: While they are free to take a day off 
anytime they wish, most feel the money is just too good to pass up in their 
on-again, off-again industry where yearlong layoffs are commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no social life, none at all," says a brooding Phillips. "Like today, I 
mowed the lawn and then fell right into bed, dead tired. Ever so often, you 
have to take a couple of days off. It's not only for your body, but for your 
mind. And for your family too." 
</P>
<P>
 These days Phillips doesn't even have time for his duties as church deacon and 
leader of the Sunday school at Little Zion Baptist Church in Compton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been to church for three weeks," he says with a sigh. "People have 
called to ask if there's a problem. This job has changed my whole sense of 
being. I mean, I am but I ain't, you know what I mean? Nobody sees me anymore. 
My spiritual life has been banished." 
</P>
<P>
 While he knows the money is good, Phillips is ever-watchful for signs of 
stress at home with wife, Terrlyn, and 16-year-old daughter, Tanisha. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter is a teen-ager and she's facing a lot of peer pressure at school. 
And I'm not there at home to sit with her after dinner and let her know that 
peer pressure is part of growing up. I'm up in bed sleeping." 
</P>
<P>
 Sleeping, that is, without his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sleep all day when my wife is at work. And she hates being alone at night. 
It's her biggest complaint. Now she sleeps with a night light on at home 
because I'm not there. We've just been married for five years and the honeymoon 
isn't over yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "At night, I want to be at home in bed with Terrlyn -- not out here hauling 
around iron poles heavy enough to kill a man." 
</P>
<P>
 For these men, the job site resembles some hostile planet, a surreal place of 
moving metal and foreign objects, where one wrong move can mean death or 
serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a strange industrial city carved into the side of a hill, where the 
once-busy lanes of an old freeway now set the stage for a new behemoth, a new 
iron and steel bridge to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene is back-lit by huge work lamps that can blind a man, make him feel 
like a scared animal caught in the flood of some highway headlights. It's an 
atmosphere filled by the maddening whir and groan of heavy machinery -- pay 
loaders and long-necked cranes that are like lumbering prehistorics, dwarfing 
solitary workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to keep on your toes here," Smith says. "Because these crane 
operators can't always see you. You get lost in the shadows of these big 
lights. It's just plain dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Night after night, the task of these ironworkers is to fasten bars of raw iron 
together into circular columns resembling gigantic Slinkys that will become the 
foundation of the towering bridge span. At night, the half-built iron-ribbed 
columns stand straight up in the darkness, looking like eerie towers from the 
Emerald City. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew boss is a Mighty Mouse of a man named Steve Pinder, a superior with a 
ponytail, earring and a wiry beard that sticks straight out like after an 
explosion, or in those old photographs of Civil War soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 The men call him "Cowboy" because of his Western hat, and his voice is hoarse 
because he's always yelling over the roar of the machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Working together in groups of three or four, Cowboy's laborers hoist 2 
3/4-inch-diameter iron bars weighing 1,500 pounds or more -- staggering under 
the weight like drunken men, always watchful for the moving monster machinery 
that pass inches away. 
</P>
<P>
 Their finished product is placed into gaping holes 100 feet deep, plugged up 
by an ocean of concrete. At one such hole, roped off by yellow security tape 
like some gruesome crime scene, a worker peered into the blackness. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like the gates of hell," he said. "Sometimes, this place gives me 
the creeps." 
</P>
<P>
 Danger lurks here. Recently, one ironworker suffered a serious back injury 
when an unsupported column fell on top of him. His co-workers, many of whom 
have taken up a collection on his behalf, say it's doubtful he'll ever return 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it was the fatigue," ironworker Dean Brasher said of the 
mishap. "Accidents just happen in an inhospitable place like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Rice, a spokesman for the California Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration, said that the agency is investigating the incident and that 
it's still too early to say if worker fatigue was involved. 
</P>
<P>
 While the agency has no standards that would force a laborer to stop work 
because of exhaustion, Rice said common sense should prevail at freeway 
construction sites, which are considered hazardous workplaces, Cal-OSHA's 
most-severe rating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, there is a potential for problems if people work long hours over a 
long period of time," he said. "But you have to weigh that against an 
individual's right to control his own destiny." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, ironworkers say, the pace of work takes its toll. Divorce rates 
among workers are high. And several have walked off the Antelope Valley Freeway 
job because of the demanding conditions and hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, the money just wasn't worth it," said Brasher, who recently left the 
site with another worker. "My family is more important to me than money. And 
that job just wore on you after awhile." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, construction work weighs heavy at home as well as on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've given him up to his job," Diane Pinder says about her husband, Steve. 
"We know it won't last forever, so we take it while we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardest hit, Diane says, has been their 8-year-old daughter, Brandy. 
</P>
<P>
 "For her, it's confusing. She and her dad don't play as much backgammon as 
they used to. She's constantly asking, 'How come daddy's not home?' 'How come 
he's going to bed in the middle of the day?' Or just, 'Where's Daddy?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Smith has also sacrificed his home life. Instead of being a father who 
likes to attend his daughter's softball games or take his girls shopping, he 
has become a modern-day Rip Van Winkle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dad tries to do all the things he used to do," says 17-year-old Andrea Smith. 
"But he can't. He's too tired. When he drives, his eyes always get real heavy. 
I say, 'Dad, maybe we should go home and go to sleep.' "

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA; HIGH BIDS POSTPONE NEW CITY HALL FLOOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan to replace the floor at City Hall and the Police Department has been 
delayed after bids submitted by contractors were far higher than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials were also disappointed that only two bids were submitted. 
</P>
<P>
 The existing floors have large clay tiles that city officials say could be 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "The floor is definitely a problem for people in wheelchairs, using crutches 
and walkers," said Director of Public Works Chris Becker. "It's also a problem 
for mothers pushing strollers and people wearing high heels." 
</P>
<P>
 The city last year budgeted $31,553 to tear out the tiles and replace them 
with a smoother surface. In requesting proposals, the city asked for bids on 
three kinds of tile: granite, porcelain and vitrestone. 
</P>
<P>
 The lowest cost estimate in the bid package for the various surfaces was 
$41,239, and the highest was $89,507. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we can redo the bid specifications to get more bids," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Becker cited concern for disabled people as a factor in the decision to 
replace the floor, one member of the city's Committee on the Disabled has 
criticized the plan as an unnecessary expense when the city faces another round 
of budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Goodman, who uses a wheelchair, said the city should find a temporary 
solution to the problem and not replace the floor until the budget situation 
improves. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the city is so broke it needs to raise the utility tax, this shouldn't be 
considered a priority," Goodman said. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; DISSOLUTION OF WATER DISTRICT OKD BY CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council last week called for the dissolution of the 35-year-old 
Tri-Cities Municipal Water District and suggested the city should buy its water 
from another source. 
</P>
<P>
 In a resolution passed by a 3-1 vote, the council also said the city should 
take over the maintenance and management of the San Clemente-based district. 
Councilman Thomas Lorch cast the dissenting vote and Councilman Joseph Anderson 
was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the council majority said the city could save money by bypassing 
Tri-Cities, a wholesale district that acts as a "middleman" in the imported 
water distribution system. Water imported from Northern California and the 
Colorado River is purchased by the Dana Point-based Coastal Municipal Water 
District, sold to Tri-Cities and then, in turn, sold to San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Truman Benedict portrayed his vote as a way of "cutting out a layer 
of government." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're living in an era of diminishing resources," Benedict said. "I don't 
think you can have two wholesalers. It seems as though we're paying the cost of 
one administrative unit that doesn't have to be a part of the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Lorch pleaded with the council to study the matter further before making a 
decision. If the city bypassed Tri-Cities, it would be "giving up local 
control," Lorch said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no cost data in this report," Lorch said. "Let's not change just for 
change sake." 
</P>
<P>
 The directors of the Capistrano Beach County Water District and the Capistrano 
Beach Sanitary District passed a similar resolution last week that called for 
Tri-Cities to dissolve. 
</P>
<P>
 Tri-Cities was formed in 1959 when the growing city of San Clemente could no 
longer rely on local wells for all its water needs. The district built two 
reservoirs and two pipelines to bring water into South County. 
</P>
<P>
 William C. Mecham, the president of the Tri-Cities board of directors, has 
challenged the city to show it would be cheaper if the city took over the 
maintenance and operation of the district. He said the district provides water 
cheaper than the city will be able to provide. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will forward its Tri-Cities resolution to the Local Agency 
Formation Commission, which is studying the consolidation of water districts in 
South County and will make a final decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Grand Jury is also studying the consolidation of the four 
wholesale water districts in the county, including Tri-Cities. LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; THEY FORM A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It had been 39 years since Sylvia (Tommy) Thomas played her last game. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent day at the ball field, with her 50-year-old leather baseball glove 
on her left hand, the 76-year-old Thomas was eager to play ball again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the game!" a jubilant Thomas said as she took batting practice and 
caught fly balls. 
</P>
<P>
 For Thomas, of Laguna Hills, playing baseball is still in her blood. 
</P>
<P>
 At age 15, she joined a women's major league in Canada, and played on three 
teams over 17 years, throwing in her glove at 37. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thomas, like her teammates who each have stories about their baseball 
history and statistics in the sport, say they are not too old to still play. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas has dusted off her aged glove and joined a newly formed Orange County 
softball league that players can call their own. 
</P>
<P>
 The league is for women only, 45 and older. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a good hitter and I could throw the ball well," Thomas said of skills 
in her younger years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I can barely get to first base," laughed the petite, gray-haired woman 
who sported a hot pink baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas joined the Legends League, recently organized by Fountain Valley 
resident Chad Hanna, to have fun and give softball a second try. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something I like and it's better than sitting inside and playing bridge 
all day -- which I can't stand," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole point in participating is you're not sitting home as a couch 
potato, and as long as I can still play, I might as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna, like her teammates, joined because there were no teams that catered to 
older women. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not a league for (women) seniors on the West Coast," said Hanna, 73, 
who has been involved in baseball for 60 years. "We are the first." 
</P>
<P>
 Practice started in January with four women, then two weeks later, there were 
enough players to make a team. Now, 60 women are involved, Hanna said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel it's going to grow, that it's really going to take off," Hanna said, 
adding that some players hadn't picked up a bat in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Players practice Saturday afternoons from 1 to 3 and 3 to 5 at Greer Park, off 
McFadden Avenue and Golden West Street in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna recently added a second practice because of the number of women who want 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna said three teams will begin playing in Huntington Beach's softball 
league on Friday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna also said she has grand plans for the league: to have teams that compete 
in tournaments and travel the country to play. 
</P>
<P>
 These women are energetic, enthusiastic and high-spirited -- just like they 
were in their youth; the league has given them a new lease on life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a way of getting together and letting people know we are not down for 
the count," said Lillie Emerson,60, of Tustin, a nurse who was the only 
civilian on a U.S. Air Force ball team 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot to offer. Age is just a matter of the mind. Just because you 
become a certain age doesn't mean you have to sit in a rocking chair." 
</P>
<P>
 Being involved with the league means making a commitment to practice and a 
desire to compete and win, Emerson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the women played competitive ball in high school and college, and some 
currently play on co-ed teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Vicki Ward, 50, of Cerritos, a retired police officer and currently a court 
officer, said playing softball makes her feel good about herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward said she hadn't played in 10 years -- until she joined the Legends 
League. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel great, just like a kid. I feel young again," she said, tossing a 
softball into her glove. 
</P>
<P>
 Those interested in joining the league can call Hanna at (714) 775-8815. DEBRA

 The Redevelopment Agency has authorized its staff to negotiate a loan of 
$750,000 for a landlord who would use it to provide 50 affordable housing units 
for the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency helped Town and Country Apartments owner Don McBride previously, 
when it issued $5.3 million in revenue bonds for the construction of the 
apartment complex.McBride built the 122-unit complex in 1985, dedicating 25 
apartments to low-income tenants for 10 years, as required by agreement with 
the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1996, McBride will no longer be obligated to provide the low-income 
housing, city officials said. The $750,000 loan from the agency will enable him 
to again offer units at below-market rates, said Susan Georgino, director of 
redevelopment services. 
</P>
<P>
 McBride has proposed making 50 units affordable. The city will control the 
rents, which would be between $538 and $630. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is required by law to provide low-income housing, Georgino said. The 
$750,000 loan, which is to be paid back with interest, will also benefit the 
Redevelopment Agency, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a real win-win" situation, said Councilman Burnie Dunlap, one of the 
agency's directors. "We have a legal obligation and we're not going to get 
there without this particular project." 
</P>
<P>
 Added another director, Gene Leyton: "I think it's a great project." MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; WATER DISTRICT PLANS CONSOLIDATION TALKS

<P>
 As a potential battle over combining South County water districts looms, the 
South Coast Water District will meet Wednesday to discuss participating in 
consolidation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The water district's community advisory committee will have a panel discussion 
at 7 p.m. in the district board room, 31592 West St. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel will include district General Manager Michael Dunbar and a 
representative from the county Local Agency Formation Commission, which 
oversees consolidation of government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials encourage the public to attend; a question-and-answer 
session will be included. 
</P>
<P>
 The water district's board of directors is studying whether the district, 
which serves the Laguna Beach area, should join forces with one or more of the 
water agencies in South County. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue has grown heated in San Clemente, where the City Council last week 
called for the liquidation of the Tri-Cities Water District, its major water 
supplier. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials consider Tri-Cities a middleman and hope to save money by 
purchasing directly from the smaller district's supplier. 
</P>
<P>
 Tri-Cities officials have rejected San Clemente's liquidation proposals and 
say they might pursue consolidation with the South Coast Water District. FRANK

<TEXT>
<P>
 UC Irvine's Heart Disease Prevention program is looking for volunteers to 
participate in a study of a new combination of drug therapies aimed at 
retarding or preventing hardening of the arteries. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Nathan Wong, a main investigator on the UCI study team, said the study 
will administer a combination of drugs, including a calcium-channel blocker, 
and the progress of the patients will be evaluated by "ultra-fast computed 
tomography," a new non-invasive coronary artery X-ray. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong said about 180 men and women at risk for coronary heart disease and with 
high levels of cholesterol will be recruited for the project at UCI and at 
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in Torrance, which is providing the special 
scanning. 
</P>
<P>
 Those eligible to participate, Wong said, are men between the ages of 40 and 
64 and women between 50 and 69 who have LDL-cholesterol levels of 130 to 230 
and are not currently on cholesterol-reducing medication. 
</P>
<P>
 Study candidates also must have a history of heart disease such as a heart 
attack, bypass surgery or angioplasty or other risk factors such as diabetes, 
high blood pressure, obesity, smoking or a family history of early heart 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who want to participate in the study should write to the UCI Heart 
Disease Prevention Program at 1 Medical Plaza Drive, Room 1616, Irvine, Calif. 
92717, or call (714) 856-7688 for more information or to schedule a required 
screening. LESLIE BERKMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Westminster School District will hold a public hearing tonight to hear 
public views on whether to declare two elementary schools and part of a third 
campus surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 The district Property Advisory Committee is considering selling or leasing 
Virginia K. Boos Elementary and James W. Franklin Elementary and a 10-acre 
portion of Finley Elementary, spokeswoman Audrey Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee will make its recommendation to the school board in the next few 
months. After holding its own hearing, the full board will make its decision. 
</P>
<P>
 To optimize the number of students at schools throughout the district, the 
Board of Education voted this year to close Boos and Franklin in June, Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Surplus sites may be sold or leased at the board's discretion, and each site 
will be considered individually, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Finley site is at 13521 Edwards St. Franklin is at 14422 Hammon Lane in 
Huntington Beach. The hearing will be held at 7 p.m. at Boos, 13890 Hammon 
Place, in Westminster. JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; VANDALS HIT EATERY THAT OFFERS BUFFALO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Graffiti vandals, apparently animal-lovers, recently attacked one of the 
county's few restaurants that serves buffalo meat. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurant owner Benjamin Bennani said someone smashed a $500 sign in front of 
his G&G International Pizza / House of Buffalo and left a cardboard sign 
bearing the words "buffalo killer" in his window. The vandalism, which occurred 
May 1, is being investigated by the police, Bennani said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennani opened his restaurant at 1125 Victoria St. three years ago to serve 
buffalo pizza and buffalo hamburgers. He wanted to popularize a food he says is 
tasty and healthful. 
</P>
<P>
 But all along, he said, people have called him in anger to contend that 
buffalo are endangered and should not be eaten. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, there are more than 120,000 buffalo in the United States, according 
to Karen Sekich, director of the American Bison Assn. in Denver. And the main 
reason there are so many buffalo, Sekich said, is because people like to eat 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we didn't have a use for them, they would be gone," said Sekich. One bison 
rancher she knows is fond of pointing out that "you never saw an extinct 
chicken," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Bison Assn. promotes the preservation, production and marketing 
of bison, Sekich said. There are more than 1,400 members in 50 states and 14 
countries, including more than 800 bison breeders, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The word buffalo is a scientifically incorrect name for the bison, Sekich 
said, but it has stuck. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennani said more than half his sales are foods that include buffalo meat. He 
has made buffalo lasagna and buffalo spaghetti sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of his job running the restaurant is working to educate people that the 
food is legal and healthy, Bennani said. But it's been an uphill battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennani spent about $2,000 to have a buffalo mounted and placed it in front of 
his restaurant when he opened, he said. At his grand opening, he gave away 
photos of people posing next to the stuffed animal. 
</P>
<P>
 But a month later, after receiving complaints, he felt compelled to take the 
mounted buffalo down. "We had a few people who didn't like that at all," 
Bennani said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bennani ran an advertisement for his restaurant that asked "Have you ever 
eaten buffalo?" he received more complaints from people arguing that buffalo 
are endangered. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennani has continued to sell the meat, but now he maintains a low profile, 
answering the phone simply by saying "G&G Pizza." 
</P>
<P>
 He gives out two different sets of coupons to customers. One coupon, for 
people who know about the buffalo meat, offers discounts on buffalo products. 
For the rest, another set of coupons simply offers discounts on pizza, 
sandwiches and drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 "That way I keep a distance from harassment," Bennani said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the last few weeks, the harassment has increased. People have been 
calling him more often. Paint has been splattered on his wall, including the 
word butcher, Bennani said. He quickly painted it over. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't kill the buffalo," Bennani lamented. "We just buy the meat and serve 
it. I don't know why they have to give us problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hurt me more than it's hurt the business," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Bennani has developed a group of loyal customers, he said. But 
if the harassment continues, Bennani said, he might sell the business and try 
somewhere else. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; SIX SCHOOLS TO SPLIT FOUNDATION GRANTS

<P>
 Children in the Fountain Valley School District were the big winners last 
month as the Fountain Valley Educational Foundation awarded nine grants 
totaling about $15,000 to pay for classroom programs at six schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In its dozen years in existence, the foundation has raised $181,000 to enhance 
the quality of education in district schools, said Debbi Setterquist, 
foundation president and a second-grade teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Setterquist said the grant money "allows an individual teacher to pursue over 
and above what is already provided as part of the curriculum."  
</P>
<P>
 This year, the foundation received 28 grant applications, Setterquist said. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation announced the recipients of the grant money at a Fountain 
Valley School District Board of Trustees meeting on April 28. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest grant, totaling $3,000, was awarded to teachers at Fred Moiola 
Elementary School for a program on conflict resolution and peer mediation. 
</P>
<P>
 The program teaches students how to solve their problems through effective 
communication skills without using violence, said fifth-grade teacher Suzanne 
Green, who is among four teachers coordinating the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Green said the grant money will be used to modify the existing program as well 
as to expand it to other schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Other schools receiving grant money for educational programming included: 
</P>
<P>
 * James H. Cox Elementary School, math lab materials and hardware and software 
for a multimedia computer research laboratory for the school library. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kasuo Masuda Middle School, mathematics software. 
</P>
<P>
 * Isojiro Oka Elementary School, math lab materials. 
</P>
<P>
 * Samuel E. Talbert Middle School, software and other high-tech equipment for 
science, history and English programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hisamatsu Tamura Elementary School, science materials for physical and 
natural science experiments and software for computer literacy, math and 
science programs.DEBRA CANO

said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The man entered the bank about 1:30 p.m. Saturday, wearing a black mask and a 
white sweat shirt with a black hood, said Officer Cathryn Delvecchio of the Los 
Angeles Police Department's Van Nuys station.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; HIGH SCHOOL VIDEO PROMOTES ABSTINENCE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The school board has approved the use of a videotape that encourages students 
to abstain from sex. 
</P>
<P>
 The video, entitled "Sex, Lies and the Truth", will be shown to high school 
students enrolled in health classes. 
</P>
<P>
 State laws require that school districts include abstinence as part of their 
sex-education curriculum, said Sally Snyder, the Irvine Unified School 
District's health services coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-minute video features TV actor Kirk Cameron, as well as other 
celebrities and professional athletes. In the video, they advocate abstinence 
with the slogan: "Waiting is not a sign of weakness, it's a sign of 
self-control." 
</P>
<P>
 "These are people that teen-agers might consider role models," Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
 The video also mentions that condoms are not always effective in preventing 
the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 The district purchased one videotape, which health teachers can use in the 
classroom. The tape, purchased for $85, was produced by Focus on the Family, 
Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teaching abstinence is just one part of the district's sex-education 
curriculum. Students also learn about sexually transmitted diseases, AIDS 
prevention and human reproduction, Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the district does not advocate condom use, students do learn about 
the effectiveness rate of condoms and other forms of contraception, she said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; POLICE OFFICERS GET SLIGHT PAY INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Non-management police officers received a slight pay increase when the City 
Council last week finalized a new three-year contract with the Fountain Valley 
Police Officers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Ray Kromer said the salary adjustments were calculated based on 
"average total compensation" figures of all police agencies in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get all of the compensations in every city, run the average, and that's 
the salary that is paid," Kromer said, adding that the city was fair in its 
contract negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It turned out good for both parties," he said. "Both (parties) were realistic 
about the current economy and the financial conditions of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 The average increase in salary is 0.53%, or between $19 and $33 a month, 
depending on the employee's rank and salary step, said Jean Hirai, personnel 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract covers 59 members of the association, which includes patrol 
officers, canine officers, senior officers, sergeants and detectives, Hirai 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The salary range for officers is $3,254 to $3,995 a month and for sergeants, 
$4,035 to $4,904. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior police officers are paid 5% above their regular rate and canine 
officers receive 2.5% above their regular rate to reflect the increased duties 
they perform. 
</P>
<P>
 In other council action, a $187,383 contract was awarded to Manhole Adjusting 
Inc. of Monterey Park for a street repair project, in which asphalt rubber chip 
seal will be applied to some residential streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The company was not the lowest bidder but won out over Paving Contractors Inc. 
of Long Beach, which submitted a bid nearly $9,000 less. But because of Manhole 
Adjusting's experience and performance record of applying the unique process 
that is mixed with paving oil and rubber, the council gave that company the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 Residential streets that will be repaired next month include those 
neighborhoods between Newland and Bushard streets; and on the north side 
between Warner and Talbert avenues, said Wayne S. Osborne, public works 
director. Osborne said the project is expected to start June 1 and take two 
weeks to complete. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; BUS FEES MAY GO UP OVER NEXT TWO YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Because of cuts in state funding, the Orange Unified School District is 
considering raising its bus fees over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The district, which experienced a strike recently in a contract dispute with 
bus drivers and other non-teaching employees, is proposing to raise fees from 
$180 to $250 in 1994-95 for the first child bused to school from each 
household.Busing a second child next year would cost $200, compared to $180 
this year. Under current proposals, fees would again rise in 1995-96, to $275 
for the first child and $225 for the second child. 
</P>
<P>
 About 7,000 students rely on bus transportation to get to the district's 37 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee increases would raise an additional $105,000 for the district each 
year, and officials say that would help offset a $900,000 gap between state 
reimbursement and the actual cost of transporting students to school by bus. 
</P>
<P>
 A transportation survey will soon go out to parents. Among other things, the 
questionnaire will ask parents how students currently get to school, if parents 
would consider car-pooling students and what amount parents could pay to bus 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first reaction when I heard about a proposed increase was 'Here is another 
tax for the parents,' and I don't find that to be a good option," said school 
board member Rick Ledesma. "I want to see what else we can do." 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Trustees instructed the staff to present a report on the survey's 
findings in about a month. The board will probably vote on bus transportation 
fee increases in June. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; COMPUTER MENTORS TO TRAIN TEACHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Public high school teachers in Huntington Beach, Fountain Valley and 
Westminster soon will be getting more help in using computers because of a 
state project. 
</P>
<P>
 Two teachers in the three-city Huntington Beach Union High School District 
have been picked as mentors in the California Technology Project.The two, 
Rachel Carlson and Kenneth Skolyan, will help train other teachers in the 
district on how to communicate via computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be teachers of teachers," Carlson said. "We'll be helping teachers, and 
therefore the kids, into the world of telecommunications." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson and Skolyan are among 20 educators in Orange, San Diego and Imperial 
counties who were recently selected by the California Technology Project to 
serve as mentors, or trainers. The goal of the state project is to upgrade 
students' abilities to use computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson said California has a long way to go. "California ranks 50th out of 50 
states in the number of computers available to computer students," she said. 
"This project is aimed at getting more computers and technology into the 
classrooms." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the solutions, Carlson said, is helping teachers become comfortable 
with computer technology. Carlson said she and Skolyan would help other 
teachers learn how to communicate with libraries and data banks via computer. 
Teachers also will learn how to exchange electronic messages with educators in 
distant areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson is assigned to Huntington Beach Union High School District 
headquarters as a technology coordinator. She normally serves as librarian for 
both Westminster High and Marina High in Huntington Beach. Skolyan is a 
Westminster High business teacher. BILL BILLITER

LOS ALAMITOS ELEMENTARY HIT BY FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fire on Sunday swept through a two-story building at Los Alamitos Elementary 
School, damaging five classrooms and causing an estimated $250,000 damage. 
</P>
<P>
 A fire official said the cause of the blaze was "definitely suspicious," 
adding that several witnesses observed a few teen-agers running from an area 
near the building minutes before the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Fire Department Capt. Dan Young said Los Alamitos police 
confirmed there had been a burglary in the building shortly before the fire 
broke out at 3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze destroyed three classrooms and damaged two others. Three dozen 
firefighters put out the blaze in about 25 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 Some students who attend classes today will be displaced, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Investigators are not yet willing to call it an arson," Young said. "But that 
is likely to change. We are looking for people to come forward with information 
about those teen-agers who were running from the building."

SCHOOLS SEEK GRANT TO FIGHT DRUG USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The school district has applied for a $100,000 grant to continue a program 
that tries to prevent drug use by high school students. 
</P>
<P>
 The district received a similar grant last year from the California Office of 
Criminal Justice Planning.The money was used to provide students with drug 
counseling and create drug-prevention programs, said Nancy Colocino, project 
director for the Irvine Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials now want the state to renew the grant so that the drug 
programs can continue. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 grant also helped the district fund counseling services for parents 
of "at-risk" teens as well as a community service program that enables students 
to volunteer their time to nonprofit groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the community service makes them feel like a resource and makes them 
feel like part of the solution," Colocino said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board approved the grant application at last week's meeting.

<P>
 A 34-year-old man has been booked for murder in connection with a two-car 
accident that killed his 5-year-old son Saturday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers of both cars involved have been charged with drunk driving and are in 
the Van Nuys Jail awaiting court appearances.The men are Pedro Guzman, the 
boy's father, and Gilbert Ramirez, 24, of Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little unusual," said Los Angeles police Officer Jim Odin of the 
Valley Traffic Division, referring to car accidents involving two drunk 
drivers. "The son was pronounced dead at the scene because of massive head 
trauma." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the three people were wearing seat belts at the time, Odin said. The 
child, William, was ejected from the car. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, Guzman swerved into oncoming lanes and hit Ramirez's 
pickup on Riverton Avenue near Arminta Street in Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Guzman of North Hollywood is being held on $1-million bail. Ramirez, who was 
booked for manslaughter, is being held on $35,000 bail. VIVIEN LOU CHEN

4 TOWN COUNCIL CANDIDATES UNOPPOSED; ELECTION: ONLY THE DISTRICT 5 SEAT IN 
CASTAIC IS CONTESTED. THE PANEL OFFERS GUIDANCE TO COUNTY OFFICIALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 New leaders Tuesday will join a citizens panel here that has an unofficial but 
influential role on community issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the Castaic Town Council's 10 seats are up for grabs, one for each 
district, although most candidates are running unopposed. Polls are open from 7 
a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday, with the election's sole precinct at Castaic Elementary 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second election for the town council, which began in 1992 to 
provide "old-fashioned town hall meetings" to discuss issues facing the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Members serve four years, although the initial election cut that in half for 
one seat in each district to stagger the terms. Meetings are held every third 
Wednesday of the month at Live Oak Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 The council has provided guidance to county officials about future 
development, approved plans for 20,000 motorcyclists to visit for the annual 
Love Ride that benefits the Muscular Dystrophy Assn., and even researched the 
hazards of killer bees someday entering the town. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot legislate and we cannot adjudicate, but we can endorse," said 
Samuel Ara Azhderian Jr., council president. "We act like a big brother, for 
the little brother of Castaic, to the big boys in authority." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its unofficial status, the town council commands respect from elected 
officials. About 15 such groups operate in Los Angeles County's 5th District, 
and Supervisor Michael Antonovich encourages developers to consult with Castaic 
and other councils before trying to build in a community. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have the ear of the supervisor," said Jo Anne Darcy, field deputy for 
Antonovich's Santa Clarita Valley office. "They're elected by their peers. In 
the absence of a city or a supervisor, they keep tabs on things on a day-to-day 
basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Qualls, 32, who owns a construction equipment and rental company, and 
Robert Smith, 69, a retired aerospace engineer, are competing for District 5, 
which includes Castaic north of Lake Hughes Road to Pyramid Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The council) is a body to help expedite things you want to get done in the 
community," said Qualls. "I want to make sure our town grows." 
</P>
<P>
 Qualls, a four-year resident of the community, said she became involved with 
the town council at the prodding of her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said he believes that Castaic will soon face the issue of incorporating 
into a city, and must plan for future development. He first brought up the 
issue of killer bees to the town council and, if elected, will do so again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a threat to the community and not too many people are aware of them," 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates are running unopposed in the other four districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Ferrier, 40, a realtor and retired police officer, will take over in 
District 1, covering the southeast portion of Castaic. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Patrich, 43, a mechanical repair supervisor for Los Angeles County, will 
represent District 2, which covers Val Verde. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Massey, 50, a parking facility manager, will retain his seat in 
District 3, which encompasses Hasley Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Mazzeo, 40, a painting contractor, will take over in District 4, which 
covers downtown Castaic.

ACCIDENT KILLS 2 ON ANTELOPE VALLEY FREEWAY

<P>
 Two people were killed early Sunday after the car in which they were riding 
swerved out of control and flipped over several times, ejecting the occupants 
on the southbound Antelope Valley Freeway near Newhall, the California Highway 
Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have not determined what caused the accident and did not release 
the names of the two victims riding in the car, pending notification of next of 
kin. 
</P>
<P>
 A third unidentified person had been in the car as a passenger and was taken 
to a San Fernando Valley hospital with massive injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the three were wearing seat belts and all were ejected from the car 
when it failed to make a left-hand turn just south of Escondido Canyon Road, 
said CHP Officer Frank Lewis. The car swerved into the right shoulder and 
flipped over several times. VIVIEN LOU CHEN

TRADE MISSION MAY HAVE TO CONDUCT DAMAGE CONTROL; PACIFIC RIM: DELEGATION FROM 
SAN DIEGO AND TIJUANA IS LIKELY TO ENCOUNTER ASIAN INVESTORS WORRIED ABOUT 
ASSASSINATIONS IN MEXICAN BORDER CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Susan Golding is scheduled to lead a delegation of San Diego and Mexican 
business leaders on a two-week trip to Asia to tout the San Diego-Tijuana 
region as ideal for foreign businesses seeking to take advantage of the North 
American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegation, which will depart May 18, is expected to plug Tijuana's cheap 
labor and San Diego's infrastructure and amenities for foreign executives who 
want to be close to that labor source. 
</P>
<P>
 But Golding and her colleagues may have to fend off questions from concerned 
Asian investors worried about a Mexican border city that seems out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip -- to Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong -- is set to begin just weeks after 
the April 28 killing of Tijuana police chief Federico Benitez. And widely 
broadcast television images of assassinated presidential candidate Luis Donaldo 
Colosio bleeding on a Tijuana street on March 23 may be fresh in the minds of 
the business people the delegation is trying to impress. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip reflects a new spirit of cooperation between two cities, which have 
often been at loggerheads. Since Golding and Tijuana Mayor Hector Osuna Jaime 
were elected in late 1992, however, the cities have worked closely on planning 
and business matters, including ways of profiting from NAFTA in competition 
with other U.S.-Mexico border regions. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea behind the effort is that San Diego and Tijuana may get further in 
the competition by joining forces. 
</P>
<P>
 But the recent assassinations and shootouts between rival police agencies, as 
well as growing drug-related lawlessness, may have tarnished Tijuana's image 
and may be a serious setback to the joint industrial recruitment effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese companies mulling a move to Tijuana have adopted a "wait-and-see 
attitude" at least until after Mexico's presidential election in August, said 
Yudo Yamamoto, a San Diego-based consultant who advises Japanese industrial 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "Foreigners are quite concerned with making new investments in Tijuana and in 
Mexico in general. Money seems to be drying up," said Colleen Morton, vice 
president of Institute of the Americas, a La Jolla think tank specializing in 
Latin American issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of that is the pre-election caution. But Tijuana has other problems, the 
drug trafficking, corruption in the police force and the crime rate in 
general," Morton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others say recent events haven't shaken foreigners' belief in Tijuana's 
long-term prospects as a trade hub. Japanese businessmen, for example, seem 
more worried by the recent killings of two Japanese students in Los Angeles, 
said William L. Everitt, vice president of Kyocera International, a Japanese 
ceramics company with plants in San Diego and Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 But the violence comes at a time when San Diego and Tijuana are locked in 
competition with other U.S and Mexican cities to attract foreign companies, 
factories and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle; Phoenix; El Paso, and McAllen, Tex., are just a few of the other 
cities that have sent or soon will be sending officials to call on Asian 
companies. The cities and regions all are touting their own strengths -- and 
other cities' weaknesses. And the tragic events of recent weeks have given the 
San Diego-Tijuana region's competition plenty of ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that this violence has to be devastating. It just has to give the 
(San Diego-Tijuana) region a black mark," said a high level government source 
in Texas who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Golding could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 NAFTA is expected to generate jobs because the trade pact among the United 
States, Mexico and Canada is forcing foreign companies to make a higher 
percentage of their products' content in North America if they are to qualify 
for preferential tariff treatment. Up to now, many manufacturers, including 
Japanese consumer electronics and appliance giants, have imported parts from 
other countries for assembly in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a primary goal of the San Diego-Tijuana delegation's trip is to 
attract suppliers of Casio, Sony and Sanyo and other big Japanese firms that 
already operate big assembly plants in the San Diego-Tijuana region but that 
typically import the major components from the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese and Taiwanese companies are "scared that NAFTA is going to affect 
their ability to access this huge market," said Mario Hernandez, president of 
San Antonio Economic Development Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The rapidly strengthening yen is also forcing Japanese companies to move here 
because the stronger currency makes foreign labor and materials cheaper than in 
Japan, said Hideto Miura, chief director of the Japan External Trade 
Organization, a government agency that promotes foreign trade. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. cities are also hoping to capitalize on fears that China may lose its 
"most favored nation" (MFN) status. That's because the loss of MFN status would 
add so much to the costs of Chinese manufacturing that companies now in China 
will transfer operations here. 
</P>
<P>
 "The violence is hitting Tijuana at a very bad time when all these trade 
opportunities have opened up," said Rudy Fernandez, director of the state Trade 
and Commerce Agency.

MEDICAL SPECIALTY; VIVAHEALTH PLAN IS STATE'S FIRST HMO TO TARGET A 'BEST-KEPT 
SECRET': LATINOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a tiny health care plan, finding a spot in a Southern California market 
ruled by giant corporations isn't easy. But Ruth Lopez-Williams hopes to tap 
the "best-kept secret" in Los Angeles by serving a population -- lower-income 
Latinos -- that the big guys have ignored for years. 
</P>
<P>
 She helped start VivaHealth Plan, a health maintenance organization recently 
licensed by the state, which says it can offer something the Kaiser Permanentes 
and PacifiCares can't: an HMO that provides medical care specially tailored to 
an ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
 After seven years of arduous effort to sell its idea to doctors, hospitals, 
business people and state regulators, VivaHealth last week kicked off its 
marketing campaign as the first HMO in the state -- and probably one of the 
first in the nation -- to exclusively target Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Monterey Park-based health plan will have to move fast to seize the 
moment. Lopez-Williams, VivaHealth's chief executive, concedes that the 
"secret" she speaks of is slowly getting out: A few large HMOs are seeing the 
same opportunity and making inroads into predominantly Latino communities in 
Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 FHP International, for example, has linked up with White Memorial Hospital and 
a medical group of mostly Spanish-speaking doctors in East Los Angeles to try 
to expand its business in that area, said Elayne Bendel, a spokeswoman for the 
Fountain Valley-based HMO. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the demographics of the region we serve, and we'd be very foolish . . 
. to write off this whole population," Bendel said. "We're taking some special 
steps to make FHP attractive to Hispanic consumers." The company also has 
special marketing programs for the Cambodian, Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese 
communities, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Shield of California believes the Latino market has "tremendous 
potential," company spokesman Mike Odom said. "It's been a segment of the 
population that perhaps hasn't been directly marketed to by HMOs and other 
health plans." 
</P>
<P>
 VivaHealth has assembled a network of 1,300 physicians -- many of them 
Spanish-speaking -- in East Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley. It has also 
affiliated with several Southland hospitals -- including Downey Community 
Hospital, which provided $3 million in start-up funds in exchange for part 
ownership of VivaHealth's state license. 
</P>
<P>
 VivaHealth's fortunes will depend on its success at portraying itself as an 
alternative to "plain vanilla" health plans. It will stress the idea that 
Latinos have unique needs that are best met by bilingual and "culturally 
sensitive" doctors and nurses, Lopez-Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of VivaHealth's doctors are Latinos or have years of experience 
practicing medicine in Latino communities. Lopez-Williams said that makes them 
more sensitive to cultural factors that can affect medical care, such as the 
frequent use of home remedies by Latino immigrants to treat minor illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Hector Flores, a Boyle Heights primary care physician, agrees: "There is 
no substitute for a physician being able to communicate directly with the 
patient, not just in making diagnoses, but also in handling 
psychological-social issues." 
</P>
<P>
 VivaHealth was founded by Lopez-Williams and her brother, Dr. John Thropay, 
who runs a cancer treatment center in Montebello. Lopez-Williams, who holds an 
MBA from Pepperdine University, has been chief executive of the center since 
the early 1980s. Thropay is chairman of VivaHealth. 
</P>
<P>
 Through years of work at the cancer center, Lopez-Williams and Thropay became 
convinced that an HMO tailored to that community could be a financial success. 
From a health plan executive's standpoint, Lopez-Williams said, the Latino 
market has a strong but not widely recognized appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos "have a high proclivity of family formation, family support, high 
participation in the private work force and are one of the fastest-growing 
small-business segments in Los Angeles County," she said. "It's also a very 
healthy community, and that's a well-kept secret." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Prof. David Hayes-Bautista, who is an adviser to VivaHealth, said the 
perception of the traditional medical community is that health care for ethnic 
groups "is very expensive, very high-trauma with lots of noncompliance, and 
that it's a money-loser. Therefore, one should not rush to provide coverage for 
minority patients." 
</P>
<P>
 But just the opposite is true, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Latino population, in general, is younger, healthier, stable and 
employed," said Hayes-Bautista, director of the UCLA School of Medicine's 
Center for the Study of Latino Health. Latinos are only one-fifth as likely to 
die from heart disease, stroke or cancer as the general population. They have 
lower overall rates of cigarette and alcohol use. And Latino members of HMOs 
spend one-third less time in the hospital than others in their plan, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such statistics suggest that Latinos are a good risk for health insurers. 
Because HMOs typically receive a flat monthly fee for each member enrolled, 
regardless of how much medical care those members receive, HMOs strive to 
enroll the healthiest populations they can. Simply put, the lower a health 
plan's costs per member, the greater its potential profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez-Williams said VivaHealth will try to keep its members healthy by 
emphasizing routine preventive care. 
</P>
<P>
 But her company faces a difficult struggle in trying to market its plan to 
small or family-owned businesses. Many such businesses offer skimpy health 
benefits or none at all because of the expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez-Williams believes she can appeal to such companies by emphasizing cost 
-- she says premiums will be about 10% below the lowest in the market -- and 
tailored coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Latino businesses are primarily family businesses," she said. "When I go to 
these employers, this isn't just about their businesses, it's also about their 
families." 
</P>
<P>
 But it's likely to take more than an appeal to family concerns to woo Latino 
business people. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are coming late to the market, and there are major players already there 
who are well-funded and who will continue to dominate," said one East Los 
Angeles doctor who is part of VivaHealth's network but didn't want his name 
used. "Viva will really have to appeal on pricing to business, and . . . it 
will have to have some major financial backers." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if VivaHealth can't survive on its own, it may make an attractive 
acquisition for a larger health plan trying to grab a bigger piece of the 
Latino market. It might also serve as a market test for the effectiveness of 
preventive health programs, which President Clinton is stressing in his health 
care reform package. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a population for whom all this talk about primary care and family 
care might actually work," Hayes-Bautista said. "But the providers will have to 
understand how to work with Latino caseloads, and not a lot is known about

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: IS THE FED LOSING CONTROL OF INTEREST RATES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Investors who thought the bond market had already gone from bad to worse are 
searching for new superlatives, after Friday's massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 Some also are searching for fresh derogatory terms with which to describe the 
Federal Reserve Board, whose policies are once again being criticized as 
dangerously misguided. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, short- and long-term interest rates rocketed on Friday after 
the government reported a surprising surge in new jobs in April, more proof 
that the national economy is humming along. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders of short-term Treasury bills, convinced that economic strength will 
force the Fed to raise the cost of money further, pushed the yield on 
three-month Treasury bills from 4.13% on Thursday to 4.29% on Friday -- a yield 
last seen in the fall of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In the long end of the bond market, meanwhile, the yield on the bellwether 
30-year Treasury bond closed at 7.55% on Friday, up dramatically from 7.33% on 
Thursday and the highest in 17 months. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, at least, long-term yields jumped not because the Fed is expected 
to officially boost short rates again, but because it didn't do so on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 If Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is serious about restraining the economy and 
thus inflation -- the No. 1 worry of long-term bond investors -- why wouldn't 
he demonstrate that by acting forcefully to tighten credit in the face of the 
robust April jobs report? 
</P>
<P>
 The easy answer to that is, the independent Fed does as it pleases. With a 
meeting of Fed governors already planned for May 17, Greenspan & Co. may feel 
there's no rush to engineer what would be the fourth official hike in short 
rates since Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 But some economists believe the Fed is making the same alleged mistake in 
raising rates that it made while cutting rates between 1990 and 1993: It's 
going too slow and is in danger of losing control of the economy and interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 As the economy languished in 1991 and 1992, the Fed for the most part 
continued a gradualist policy of small rate cuts every few months. Some 
economists argued throughout that period that the economy needed shock 
treatment -- deep rate cuts, on the order of one percentage point at a time -- 
to get moving again. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Fed wasn't intimidated by its critics. Though it's impossible to say 
for sure, the Fed's tortoise-like pace may have needlessly prolonged the 
economy's slump. At the very least, it helped cost George Bush the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Fed is on the opposite side of the interest-rate curve, and again its 
critics say its gradualist policy carries too many risks. Mainly, the risk is 
an overheated economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Fed should hurry up," argues Allen Sinai, chief economist at 
Lehman Bros in Boston. Greenspan's policy of notching short-term rates up a 
quarter-point at a time, from 3% to 3.75% so far this year on the so-called 
federal funds rate, clearly isn't viewed as strong enough medicine by the bond 
market, Sinai said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would (boost) one-half point on fed funds immediately," he said. Yet he 
warns that the Fed may already be too late to forestall more trouble in the 
bond market this week: Wall Street must cope with the Treasury's quarterly 
refinancing on Tuesday and Wednesday, which will dump $29 billion (total) in 
new 3- and 10-year notes on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, loss-ridden bond owners may decide to bail early this week rather 
than wait for the government's reports on wholesale and consumer inflation in 
April. Those reports are due Thursday and Friday, respectively, and could whip 
up more bond market hysteria if the numbers suggest inflation is rising even 
marginally over the 2.5% to 3% annualized rate now thought to be "acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Also worrisome for bond investors are recent signs of surprising strength in 
the economies of some major U.S. trading partners, including Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only might bonds be ravaged by increased inflation risks, but faster 
growth throughout the industrialized world will push real interest rates 
higher" more quickly than expected, warned John Lonski, economist at Moody's 
Investors Service in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 He predicts the 30-year Treasury bond yield will hit 7.8% by midyear, further 
spooking investors who desperately want to see long-term yields stabilize. 
</P>
<P>
 While Sinai and some of his peers worry that the Fed is moving too slowly to 
subdue growth and potential inflation given the economic backdrop, some Wall 
Streeters believe the Fed is taking the only course available. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Crandall, chief economist at bond firm R.H. Wrightson & Associates in 
New York, argues that a dramatic boost in short-term rates by the Fed would be 
interpreted negatively by the bond market, not positively. 
</P>
<P>
 Since February, Crandall said, the bond market's paranoia has been rooted in 
the feeling that the Fed knows something the market doesn't: In other words, 
there aren't many significant signs of inflation visible today, but if the Fed 
is tightening credit (albeit gradually) inflation must loom. 
</P>
<P>
 If Greenspan were to suddenly raise rates by, say, a full percentage point to 
get ahead of the market, Crandall said, the risk is that bond investors would 
interpret that bold move as a sign that inflation has truly become a problem -- 
and long-term bond yields could leap accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Crandall argues, the Fed lost the battle to keep long-term 
interest rates under control well before the winter's first hike in short-term 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 By allowing speculation in the bond market to reach unprecedented levels last 
fall, as short-term rates hung at 30-year lows and investors scrambled to lock 
in any long-term yield offered them, the central bank set the clock ticking on 
the current bond market debacle, Crandall said. 
</P>
<P>
 "An awful lot of bonds found their way into the hands of people who weren't 
willing to hold onto them in a bear market," Crandall said. The reason 
long-term yields have continued to rise this year, even though inflation isn't 
yet a problem, is that many bond owners are selling out to go back to safer, 
shorter-term securities as short rates increase, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As long-term bonds flood the market, their prices decline and their yields go 
up. It's a simple equation, and an incredibly painful one for investors who 
continue to hold on to bonds as they drop in value and as yields on new 
securities look so much more enticing. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech on Friday, Greenspan made clear that he understands the nature of 
the current shakeout in bonds and how it has been made worse by the entry of so 
many unwary small investors into the bond market last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The drop in bond prices this year has been "no doubt exacerbated by 
significant net redemptions in bond mutual funds, as fund shareholders reacted 
to declines in net asset values when interest rates backed up," Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more important, the Fed chairman offered no apologies to those 
investors. The turmoil in bonds "can be viewed as an unavoidable correction," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That suggests another possible reason the Fed is content to tolerate the jump 
in long-term yields this year and not harden its policy to try and stop that 
surge prematurely: Maybe Greenspan wants to flush the bond market of people who 
don't belong there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to get bonds into the hands of a different set of investors now," 
Crandall said. Unfortunately, that transfer may take a long time and cost many 
investors much in mental and financial pain. 
</P>
<P>
 A Simple Bond Bet: Tired of watching your bond mutual fund share price drop in 
value? Do you just want to earn a decent yield, without worrying that your 
principal will be permanently eroded? 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts think there's a simple solution for income-needy bond fund 
investors who can't stand the thought of losing more principal on paper: Trade 
your fund for two-year Treasury notes. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on two-year Treasuries jumped to 6.11% on Friday from 5.89% on 
Thursday. As recently as April 22 the yield was just 5.61%. 
</P>
<P>
 Why view 6.11% as a good annual return? John Isaacson, executive vice 
president at Los Angeles-based bond manager Payden & Rygel, figures it this 
way: 
</P>
<P>
 Three-month Treasury bill yields are now 4.29%, which means the next one or 
two Fed credit tightenings are already built in. Even if you assume that the 
Fed keeps raising rates over the next two years, it would take a super-hot 
economy to justify money market rates above 6%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to ask what really has to happen (in the economy) for you to earn 
more than 6.11%" in money market accounts over the next two years, Isaacson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And even if short rates do soar above 6%, by owning Treasury notes directly 
you're still assured of getting all your money back in two years -- a promise 
bond mutual funds can't make. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, You Can Hedge: The only good news out of markets on Friday was that some 
of the classic hedges against higher inflation responded the way they should, 
given the healthy April employment report: They rose in price. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold soared $9.80 an ounce on Friday, to $383.40 on the New York Comex. The 
price of silver zoomed 32.8 cents to $5.44 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil, meanwhile, jumped 41 cents to $17.70 a barrel on the New York Merc, 
boosted by civil strife in oil exporter Yemen and by expectations of higher 
demand for energy as the global economy improves. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices of such disparate commodities as coffee, cotton and copper have been 
rising this year, though not necessarily because of stronger demand. And some 
commodities, such as grains, have tumbled on expectations of decent crops 
thanks to good spring weather in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, if Friday's action is indicative of investors' changing mind-set 
about the economy, commodities could see a wave of new money flow in. Which 
means investments such as gold, gold stock mutual funds, energy stock mutual 
funds and real estate funds may make sense now for investors looking for 
something that might rise in price if bonds and stocks continue to slide on 
interest rate worries. Seeing Red on Inflation 
</P>
<P>
 Prices of some commodities have been surging in recent weeks, adding to the 
bond market's worries about higher inflation ahead. But in key commodity 
markets, such as grains, prices have been moving down, not up.

CEOS TAKE HOME EVER-BIGGER PAYCHECKS, FORBES REPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite all the efforts to curb the compensation paid to the nation's chief 
executive officers, the CEOs of America's largest companies still managed to 
take home bigger paychecks than ever last year, according to Forbes Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine reports in its May 23 issue, "Corporate America's Most Powerful 
People," that 63% of the CEOs on its Forbes 800 list -- the biggest publicly 
held firms -- made at least $1 million in total pay in 1993, up from 61% in 
1992 and 47% in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Total compensation includes salary, bonuses and non-cash stock gains -- mainly 
from exercising options -- and other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 It said that the big money is not made in salary and bonuses but in stock 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
 The highest-paid Forbes 800 CEO in 1993, Michael Eisner of Walt Disney Co., 
made only $750,000 in salary and bonuses, but he added to that more than $202 
million from gains in stock options. 
</P>
<P>
 Measured by salary and bonuses, as a group, the Forbes 800 CEOs made 11% more 
last year than they did in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the median was $896,000 -- a base salary of $569,000 plus a $327,000 
bonus. Forbes said that median compensation soared to $1.4 million from $1.2 
million in 1992, after the gains from the exercise of stock options is factored 
in.

INAUGURATION DRAWS WORLD TO SOUTH AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mongolians sent regrets. The Icelanders too. The Rwandans and Bosnians are 
busy. And the folks in Cambodia, Cameroon and Chad forgot their manners: They 
haven't even replied. 
</P>
<P>
 But just about everybody else who's anybody in world affairs is coming, or has 
angled for an invitation, to what's being called the mother of all parties -- 
the inauguration gala here Tuesday of Nelson Mandela as the first black 
president of South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore arrives today. So does First Lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton and three jets jammed with U.S. Cabinet secretaries, members of 
Congress and official hangers-on. But they're small fry. At last count, about 
46 presidents, prime ministers and other heads of state or government -- plus 
plenty of has-beens -- were en route. 
</P>
<P>
 So were at least nine kings, princes, sheiks and other members of royalty. 
U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who according to protocol never 
attends inaugurations, was the first to arrive. Palestine Liberation 
Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat will wear his formal fatigues. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, leaders and representatives of 145 nations and 16 international 
organizations, plus 800-odd journalists, not to mention 3,000 performers and 
300 sangomas -- traditional healers and witch doctors -- and 150,000 citizens 
of this jubilant land will gather for a national coming-out party after decades 
of apartheid-era isolation, when no foreign dignitary would show his face here. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably the largest gathering of heads of state anywhere in the world," 
gushed Patrick Evans, spokesman for the inaugural committee. Added an exhausted 
spokeswoman for the South African Communication Service: "It's a logistic 
nightmare, a sheer bloody nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 The world's obsession with South Africa has always been odd. There's no oil 
here, and no foreign military bases. It's a small country, with an economy half 
that of Belgium and a population of 40 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But the horrors of apartheid, the legalized system of racial segregation, 
sparked such moral outrage around the globe that Africa's last white-ruled 
state maintained an outsize grip on international attention. And the dramatic 
climax, Mandela's electoral triumph, has proved nearly as cathartic overseas as 
it has at home. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview from Geneva with the Star, a Johannesburg newspaper, 
Boutros-Ghali said he was coming, in part, to boost his own morale. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been confronted . . . by so many setbacks and difficulties, we just 
want to enjoy it," the beleaguered U.N. chief said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela will be formally elected president today by the Parliament in Cape 
Town. The formal transfer of power from the outgoing president, Frederik W. de 
Klerk, will be here at the ornate Union Buildings, the government offices long 
seen as the symbol of white minority rule. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer. Teams of workers have refurbished the hilltop site over recent 
weeks with paint, plywood and bullet-proof glass. Vast flower gardens were torn 
out and replanted, brick walkways replaced with granite, giant tents erected 
and schedules timed to the second. 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes according to plan, Chief Justice Michael Corbett will administer 
the oath of office to Mandela at 11:08 a.m. Tuesday in a huge open-air 
amphitheater ringed by stately sandstone columns and cupolas. The new president 
will give his inaugural speech with his back to a glorious vista of hazy hills, 
jacaranda trees and gleaming office towers. 
</P>
<P>
 But several hundred of the 6,036 official guests -- those actually given white 
plastic seats inside the amphitheater -- will find themselves with no view at 
all, not even of Mandela. Their seats are blocked by high walls and statues. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans shrugged. "It's not important to see," he said. "It's important to be 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 There may be other problems as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've run out of portable toilets," Evans fretted. He's rented every one of 
them within a 200-mile radius. "There are no more to be got." 
</P>
<P>
 And what if it rains? "Then they get wet," he said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it won't rain. Will it?" he added nervously, turning to an aide. "No, no, 
it won't rain," the aide replied through clenched teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's nit-picking. There will be Hindu prayers, a reading from the Old 
Testament and another from the Koran. The effervescent Anglican Archbishop 
Desmond Tutu -- one of at least three Nobel Peace Prize winners on the stage 
(Mandela and De Klerk shared one last year) -- will offer a Christian blessing. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching the ceremony on huge screens placed around the manicured gardens 
below will be 150,000 people who had the connections or the luck to score a 
ticket. Next comes a 2 1/2-hour show with 3,000 performers, including 100 
African drummers. Organizers predict that up to 1 billion people around the 
world will watch the festivities on television. 
</P>
<P>
 With the memory of an election-eve wave of right-wing terrorist bombings still 
fresh, security obviously will be tight. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters must gather at a soccer field at 4:30 a.m. to catch shuttle buses to 
the 11 a.m. ceremony. Sewer plates are being welded shut, aircraft are being 
ordered away, and hospitals have been placed on emergency footing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten miles of razor wire will be laid out to keep traffic and crowds away. 
Members of the public -- all 150,000 -- will be bused in from distant points 
and repeatedly frisked for weapons and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Evans said, all looks good for the big day. Mandela came out, without 
telling the press, last Tuesday afternoon to examine the site and stand on the 
stage. The only witnesses were a couple of star-struck American tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were also some workers on the podium," Evans said. "The first thing he 
did was to greet the workers. Then he greeted the officials. It really was the 
best proof to me that he is really going to be the people's president."

TEACHERS' ABSENTEEISM TROUBLES L.A. DISTRICT; SCHOOLS: THEY MISS AN AVERAGE OF 
12 DAYS A YEAR. EDUCATORS CAST DOUBT ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SUBSTITUTES. 
</P>

<P>
 Teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School District miss an average of 12 days 
a year, an absence rate that the teachers union calls "frightening" and that 
disrupts learning by forcing the widespread use of substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 With the call for substitutes so high -- at least 1,000 a day, more on Fridays 
and Mondays -- some classrooms go begging. Even when substitutes are available, 
the quality of the school day suffers, say principals and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care how good a sub is, there's no replacing a regular classroom 
teacher," said Charles Baldwin, principal at Olive Vista Middle School in 
Sylmar, where teachers missed an average of 18 days last year. "A sub comes in 
and it's like a neon sign comes on (in the room) saying 'Day Off, Day Off.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The effects can be far more significant than a lost instructional day or class 
period. Althea Woods, the principal at 99th Street Elementary in Los Angeles, 
where teachers missed an average of 21 days last year, blames dramatically 
lower sixth-grade test scores on the high number of absences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Positively, those scores were abominable," Woods said. "I attribute that 
largely to the fact that these children had substitutes. It's very disruptive." 
</P>
<P>
 A new incentive program designed to give teachers cash for staying in their 
classrooms was forgotten almost as soon as it was written into the last 
teachers contract. Instead, the system encourages teachers to miss school by 
giving teachers 10 fully paid sick days a year and up to 90 half-paid days. 
Most teachers work about 180 days a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sick time cannot be cashed out at the end of the year, so there is no 
financial incentive to stay on the job. Many teachers say they use the time for 
"mental health" days, doctor's appointments or when their own children need 
child care. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the district's 33,000 teachers, just over 18,000 missed at least seven days 
of school last year. More than 8,000 missed 13 or more days. Just 5,364 
teachers had perfect attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you may have heard before, our absentee rate is frightening," said Sam 
Kresner, the director of organizational services for United Teachers-Los 
Angeles, in a recent edition of the union's newspaper. "This absenteeism 
creates huge expenditures we would like to avoid." 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers argue that the profession is stressful, that they do get sick and 
that little can be done to curb those who abuse the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're supposed to be the cure-all for everything -- social needs, parental 
needs," said Eileen Avneri, a teacher at Olive Vista Middle School. "It is 
extremely stressful. In every profession, you're going to have people who take 
advantage of the system and you'll have people who have 200 days banked. . . . 
It bothers me as much as it bothers the parents." 
</P>
<P>
 And parents are definitely bothered by the profusion of substitute teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Janice Vassil, a Northridge parent, was so frustrated by the parade of 
substitute teachers in her daughter's fifth-grade classroom that she nearly 
pulled out of a highly prized magnet school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put my kids in school to learn," said Vassil, who kept her daughter at 
Lorne Street Magnet in Northridge after a new permanent teacher was assigned. 
"When a sub comes in, it's just not the same in the classroom. There's just not 
a lot of learning." 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Schneider, whose granddaughter attends a San Fernando Valley high school, 
said teacher absences have become more than an annoyance; they are affecting 
students' work. "The kids basically learn nothing that day unless the teachers 
leave detailed work plans. Most of the time, I think they (the substitutes) sit 
up there and read and ignore the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 The average of 12 sick days a year in Los Angeles Unified has remained steady 
for several years, but district officials do not know how it compares to other 
large school systems. Most school districts around the country have focused on 
reducing student absences and paid little attention to teacher absenteeism, and 
don't track teacher absences from year to year. 
</P>
<P>
 Other districts exclude from their statistics teachers on maternity leave or 
long-term sick leave. On that basis, for example, in Dade County, Florida -- 
the nation's third-largest school district -- teachers miss an average of about 
six days a year. By the same accounting, San Diego Unified teachers missed an 
average of 5.5 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pasadena Unified School District stopped paying teachers for jury duty to 
cut down on absences. Supt. Vera Vignes, who said the decision was reached in 
contract negotiations, said the result has been fewer substitutes and more 
teachers on the job. In Los Angeles, the union contract encourages teachers to 
defer jury duty to vacation time, but they can be paid for up to 20 days of 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, teaching is a difficult and stressful job," said Gene Tucker, the 
former superintendent of the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District and a 
professor of education at UCLA. "But teachers only have about 180 days with 
children. I always felt these days are precious." 
</P>
<P>
 While most national education studies have focused on student attendance, 
little has been done on teacher absences. Charles Kerchner, a professor of 
education at the Claremont Graduate School, said most of the debate about 
teacher absenteeism is based on legend rather than facts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a folklore that says that teachers in big cities tend to be sick more 
and take what's known as mental health days," Kerchner said. "I don't think Los 
Angeles hires sicker teachers. There might be a work placement issue here -- 
there's something going on here with the nature of the conditions of the places 
where they work. Urban schools represent tough places to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers say their morale has dropped considerably over the years as their pay 
has been cut and the school district and union wrangle over contracts. Some 
teachers say that leads to a higher absentee rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The frustration level is high," said Carole Rosen-Kaplan, a Birmingham High 
School teacher. "We've had docked pay, we work in overcrowded classrooms. 
People are really stressed out -- I think teaching is getting more and more 
difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 The incentive program agreed upon during contract negotiations last year was 
aimed at getting teachers to cover for each other to reduce the number of 
substitutes hired. At the end of the year, half of the money saved would be 
paid to teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the teachers union and the school district say the program was poorly 
promoted and lacked leadership. The union's newspaper ran three short articles 
on the incentive program over the past year. Helen Bernstein, president of the 
union, said she lost interest in it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teachers are so plain angry and demoralized with this district," said 
Bernstein, whose union also represents substitutes. "Anything they think will 
help the district, they just won't do. They are just so worn out." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Supt. Sid Thompson said the district needs to improve the 
incentive program to encourage teachers to remain in their classrooms. The 
district spends about $42.5 million a year on substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "A substitute just can't step into a regular teacher's shoes and expect things 
to be the same," Thompson said. "It isn't just the money we spend on subs that 
disturbs me. Obviously, the more you have the regular teacher there, the 
better. It's to the advantage of the students to have their teacher in the 
classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Education President Leticia Quezada says the district and the union 
need to make the incentive program work but that it hasn't been a priority. 
"This year there's been too many issues to contend with," Quezada said. "We 
have in this last year gone through major efforts in this district that have 
caused some important items to be left unattended. This was one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers who were hired after 1987 or who are close to retirement are more 
inclined to take time off, according to the union and school officials, because 
they cannot apply their unused sick days toward state retirement benefits. The 
law was changed in 1987 so that teachers can no longer use accumulated sick 
time for higher pensions. 
</P>
<P>
 When teachers are sick longer than five days, principals are supposed to be 
given doctor's notes. After 20 days, teachers need to supply the principal with 
a formal illness leave request. But principals say they often are busy with 
other issues and don't enforce the doctor's note rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Leidner, the former principal at Marshall High in Los Feliz, said she 
decreased teacher absences by publicizing them. In regular updates to the 
staff, Leidner included the number of substitutes hired to cover teachers' 
absences. 
</P>
<P>
 "People knew we were looking at it and that it was a concern," Leidner said. 
"Just by making people aware, it started to decrease." 
</P>
<P>
 The school district has about 3,000 to 3,500 substitutes in a pool, about half 
of whom do not hold full teaching credentials. The substitutes make $111 a day 
and some receive health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Many schools keep their own list of substitutes preferred by the staff and who 
are called first whenever there is an absence. Some substitutes are so popular, 
in fact, schools need to make appointments weeks ahead of time, if they know 
there will be an absence. Other substitutes carry business cards and distribute 
them around faculty lounges. 
</P>
<P>
 District and union officials say substitutes can fill in capably for several 
days, but they often do not have the same training or experience as regular 
teachers and can face difficult behavioral problems in the classroom. "It's not 
an uncommon complaint that substitutes are not as competent . . . it's uneven," 
said Bob Fisher, head of the district's substitute division. 
</P>
<P>
 When no substitutes are available from the pool, other teachers on campus have 
to fill in. Even when substitutes show up, principals and teachers say they 
know that some are not going to handle the classes well. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we see them coming down the sidewalk to the office, we just groan," said 
Woods, the principal at 99th Street Elementary. "We know nothing's going to 
happen. I don't feel the sub pool is strong at all. I feel it's very weak . . . 
a weak link in the district." Absent Teachers

 HIRING SUBSTITUTES 
</P>
<P>
 When teachers are absent, schools try to hire substitutes. For the week of 
April 4-8, schools requested 5,566 substitute teachers. The following details 
the need for substitute teachers on one day -- April 4, the Monday after a 
weeklong spring break for most schools. When substitutes are not available, 
schools cover by combining classes or tapping teachers during their free 
periods.

COLUMN ONE; TRYING TO HALT 'SILENT EXODUS'; MORE KOREAN AMERICAN MINISTERS ARE 
REACHING OUT TO KEEP YOUNGER IMMIGRANTS. THEY OFFER MORE RELEVANT SUNDAY 
SERVICES AND A CULTURAL BRIDGE TO U.S. LIFE. 
</P>

<P>
 Somewhere in a room with a freeway view at the Irvine Holiday Inn, the Rev. 
David Gibbons was struck by divine revelation. Psalm 40. 
</P>
<P>
 "This may sound weird," conceded Gibbons, a young Presbyterian minister of 
Korean descent. "I heard the Lord say this to me: 'Psalm 40.' You know, 'I took 
your feet out of the miry clay and I've placed you upon the earth. I've put a 
new song in your heart.' " 
</P>
<P>
 New song meant new ministry. Gibbons, a visiting evangelist, fled the pulpit 
at a traditional Korean American church in the East. Then he moved to the ripe 
spiritual territory of suburban Orange County to launch a new church with a 
breezier, informal style of worship. His calling: reclaim a vanishing flock of 
young, highly educated Koreans who came here as grade school immigrants with 
memories of South Korea too faint for them to call that country home. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last five years, this younger generation of Presbyterians, Methodists 
and Baptists has quietly been slipping out of the sanctuary of the most 
important institution in the lives of many Korean immigrants. This is raising 
alarms louder than church bells among the remaining "worshipers," some of whom 
fear that, if the trend is unchecked, their churches could someday suffer the 
fate of some Chinese and Japanese congregations that lost their young and 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, the Korean church in the United States was something of a 
middle-class immigrant ghetto, which in its early years in the 1970s drew not 
only Christians seeking refuge and support, but Buddhists hungry to meet other 
Koreans. So, baffled pastors could not understand why this newest generation of 
immigrants did not share the same yearning for solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
 They gave the departure of the young a name: Silent Exodus. 
</P>
<P>
 "The church is a picture of what's happening between the generations," said 
Gibbons, 31, a Seoul native and son of a Korean woman and a U.S. military man. 
"There's not very good communication. These generations speak and love in a 
different manner. When you try to show some autonomy in the church, (the older 
generation) takes it as an attack on them. They want to know if you don't like 
being Korean." 
</P>
<P>
 Informal head counts and regional church surveys conducted by the Christian 
Korean American Alliance indicate that more than 60% of the English-speaking 
members in their 20s and 30s drop out of Korean churches because they cannot 
understand Korean well enough to be inspired by a Sunday sermon. Vocabulary is 
not the only problem; the independent, egalitarian values of the U.S.-educated 
generation are often strikingly at odds with the patriarchal views of an older 
generation raised on a Confucian philosophy prizing respect for age and 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their way of thinking is completely different from us," said Harold Choo, 57, 
a church elder who has tried to act as a shuttle diplomat between younger and 
older members of Young Nak Presbyterian, a Los Angeles mega-church of more than 
3,000 and one of the largest Korean congregations in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In that sensitive role, Choo has found himself defending younger members who 
tried to make English services more inspirational by extending the worship time 
and adding contemporary Christian songs with the riff of a guitar and emotional 
lyrics that sound more like love ballads than prim hymns. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the very beginning the older members thought the English services should 
be just the same as their worship. But that's not what happened," Choo said. 
"For instance, our generation is not very familiar with this style of praising 
with a guitar. They think it's rock music. Actually, it's not. But they raised 
this issue. They considered it a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaps in culture and language have led to breakaway ministries and new church 
strategies that offer considerably more than a simple English translation of a 
Korean service. In the vanguard are younger ministers who are creating hybrid 
congregations with nicknames such as "condo churches," "spiritual duplexes" or 
"religious rooms for rent." All of these maintain ties to a mother Korean 
church, but they have distinct identities with their own minister, other 
leaders and -- in rare cases -- control of the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 But some traditional ministers advocate more extreme tactics to retain younger 
members. In Whittier, Young So Hyun has gained a following among conservative 
church leaders in Southern California with his campaign to upgrade the younger 
membership's Korean language skills. Hyun, who founded the Christian Education 
Institute to promote his solution, considers Americanized Koreans "Neo-Koreans" 
who are more worldly, less spiritual. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm saying is that the more traditionally Korean they are the more 
intrinsically religious they will be," Hyun said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his practical strategies is this language tip for mothers: "Do not 
answer when they speak English. If they say, 'Give me food,' don't give them 
food. If they ask in Korean, then you may give them food." 
</P>
<P>
 Such notions are scoffed at by younger ministers -- some of whom may only know 
enough Korean to order barbecue in a Korean restaurant or the curse words that 
dare not be uttered in a house of worship. Several pastors have edited the word 
Korean out of their church names, insisting that they do not want to exclude 
non-Koreans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I ask younger members how much they understand in Korean," said 
Robert Oh, a young minister. "They understand maybe 30% or 40%. So you put a 
bunch of kids in a church and start using Korean for atonement and trinity and 
redemption. They're going to lose it," said Oh, who left a large Los Angeles 
Korean church because he felt that the English ministry was sometimes 
considered a baby-sitting service. 
</P>
<P>
 So he founded an English-language church in Bellflower, editing Korean from 
its sign and giving it a Greek name, oikos -- family. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of my members don't have a home per se because of the language barrier. 
Picture yourself: The only thing in Korean you can say to your mom is 'I'm 
hungry and I need money.' They need someone they can sit down and pour all 
their guts with. So our church has to provide family atmosphere," Oh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for almost 30 years -- during the most recent wave of Korean immigration 
-- the fathers and mothers of this younger generation sought the same kind of 
solace in their churches. 
</P>
<P>
 Now numbering more than 800 in Southern California, the Korean churches have 
offered not only spiritual comfort, but worldly advice on every topic from 
paying traffic tickets to finding a job or the best school. People could pray 
to God, find a mate, make business connections, and read about a young member's 
acceptance to Harvard in the Sunday bulletin. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, the majority of churches had less than 100 adults, although some 
expanded into thriving congregations of more than 3,000. So phenomenal was the 
growth of the immigrant church that elders jested about their reputation for 
missionary zeal, joking that Chinese immigrants start restaurants while Koreans 
break ground for sanctuaries. There was some truth in this jest; the Korean 
link to Christianity is deeper than that of other Asian immigrants -- 
Christians make up more than a quarter of South Korea's population. 
</P>
<P>
 When the children of the most recent wave of immigrants left for college, many 
did not return after they got their degrees. Some were fleeing the straitjacket 
rules of the church and its small-town dramas that occasionally erupted into 
power struggles, political splits and gossip. They found the Korean Christian 
liturgy too structured with its set format of prayers and traditional hymns. 
Some yearned for a more free-spirited service with contemporary songs and a 
minister who could leaven a lesson with an occasional joke. Many were stumped 
by the Sunday sermon, which to them was akin to watching a foreign movie 
without subtitles. 
</P>
<P>
 Some young adults accepted these traditions, particularly if they had grown up 
in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Kim, 36, an Irvine dentist who moved to the United States when he was 
18, said he and his wife prefer the Korean-language service at their church 
even though most of their peers attend the English service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I speak pretty good English and understanding the sermon is no problem," Kim 
said. "But the Korean sermons have a little something extra. I don't know how 
to put it, but spiritually it kind of attracts me more when I'm in a 
Korean-speaking environment." 
</P>
<P>
 But other young people find some of the traditions uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Korean culture is more formal," said Sue Kang, 26, a Korean-born UCLA 
graduate and Garden Grove resident who said she felt uncomfortable in the 
traditional churches because of the extreme reverence for age. "We call it the 
'Nim Syndrome.' In the Korean language, anybody who is older than you has to be 
addressed with the honorific Nim." 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of addressing the elders with Nim, some younger members started 
asking, "Why?" 
</P>
<P>
 Years of faithful attendance at Bethel Korean Church in Irvine convinced Won 
W. Choi, 55, a church elder and a McDonnell Douglas engineer, that the culture 
clash had to be addressed. The center wasn't holding. 
</P>
<P>
 His Korean-born, 25-year-old son rarely attended church, although he insisted 
he believed in God. They tried to communicate, Choi said, but sometimes he used 
English words that had a harsher meaning than he realized. At breakfast one 
morning Choi tried to offer some stern fatherly advice to his college-bound 
daughter. To his surprise, he said, she erupted in anger, declaring that she 
wanted to throw away the material gifts he had given her. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were all working to survive and we thought that we had supplied them with 
what they needed," Choi said wistfully. "Then they started to go through this 
identity crisis. They're Korean, but not Korean in a way. Their thinking 
pattern was Americanized. We faced this difficulty to communicate with them and 
we needed a bridge. That bridge is the English ministry." 
</P>
<P>
 Worried about the long-term future of Bethel Church, Choi and other elders 
decided to start an English-language congregation last year with limited budget 
powers and a bilingual minister, Moon Ju Kim. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim's thoughtful, thoroughly second-generation sermons -- on one Sunday a mix 
of references to the Los Angeles riots, Tolstoy, the Chicago Bulls and Snoopy 
-- even drew the twentysomething sons of the associate pastor from the mother 
church. Joked Timothy You: "My father's sermons put us to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually, the elders included the younger members in decisions, although they 
were not always pleased with the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 They allowed the younger generation to pick the church calendar. They also let 
them choose the paint colors for the new education building. The elders favored 
scarlet. The younger generation chose taupe. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last three years, larger churches like Bethel have cautiously started 
English-language ministries with varying autonomy. Elders usually take care to 
recruit English-speaking ministers more comfortable with Korean values. And 
often they have held on to the tools of power such as budget-making authority 
and veto rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Minister Kim considers his church much more progressive than traditional ones. 
Some young members even consider it revolutionary. Insurance agent Ed Kang, 34, 
of Costa Mesa was shocked and touched when he entered the church grounds for a 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
 The elders bowed first to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes time to get the first generation to trust," said Daniel Roh, 34, who 
leads the 3-year-old English ministry at the Oriental Mission Church in 
Koreatown. "It's a struggle. When they see a congregation with a large number 
of people, that's something they can't control. Also, they would like the 
younger generation to take over what they've already achieved rather than doing 
their own thing." 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of restrictions and controls, most English-speaking ministers have 
tried to stay close to the mother church for resources and support. A few 
pioneers have broken away from the comfort of the mother church to flex their 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the approach of David Gibbons, who decided that it was best to leave 
his established Presbyterian Korean church in Baltimore to fashion an 
untraditional Korean church in Orange County with less formality, shorter 
services and contemporary gospel songs played with an electric guitar instead 
of an organ. His church advertisements will probably be published in a 
newspaper's sports section: "Not in the religion section," Gibbons said. 
"Nobody reads that part." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, he tried to persuade his former church elders to create a completely 
independent Korean ministry. His young deacons were tired of seeking permission 
for every expenditure from the elders. They wanted more power. "It dropped like 
a bomb," Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
 So he is placing his faith -- and his new church -- in Irvine, trailing what 
he considers the newest wave of middle-class Korean American migration from Los 
Angeles to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 Psalm 40 provided the inspiration. "I have preached righteousness in the great 
congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips." 
</P>
<P>
 It also gave the church its name: New Song.

COLLEGES SCORE WINDFALL SELLING ADS ON ATHLETES; SPORTS: NIKE AND REEBOK DEALS 
BUOY CASH-STRAPPED PROGRAMS, CAMPUS OFFICIALS SAY. OTHERS SEE EXPLOITATION.

 Hundreds of miniature billboards have begun springing up at UCLA, and they're 
an advertiser's dream. They're flashy, appealing to young people and, in a good 
year, could even draw national attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The billboards also happen to be student athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 In a move that is becoming more common at major universities, UCLA in February 
signed a six-year, $4.35-million agreement with Reebok under which the shoe 
manufacturer will supply the uniforms, warm-up gear and shoes for every 
athletic team on campus. Reebok gets to put its logo on all the sports clothing 
-- everything from batting gloves to jackets to the school's football uniforms 
will now bear Reebok's "vector" icon. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement comes less than a year after USC signed a similar contract with 
Nike. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Southern California schools are among the first in the country to sign 
such contracts. Although school officials say this will provide badly needed 
revenue, some people contend that it is merely another way in which student 
athletes are used. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this day and age, all college athletic departments are up against 
financial hardships, and this is one way we can create a stream of revenue," 
said Mark Brantley, director of corporate relations at USC. "There is that 
other side of the coin where people say, 'Hey, you're putting stuff on the 
athletes and making money off of it,' but they're getting an education here and 
it's all part of the process of us running a business. That's the way we look 
at it. It's a business, and we're generating revenue." 
</P>
<P>
 USC, citing its status as a private university, has refused to divulge how 
much money it received, but sources say the school probably received several 
million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for supplying school teams with uniforms, Nike will be allowed to 
advertise on banners at volleyball and tennis tournaments, on the video board 
at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and on the rotating board at the Sports 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The deals are a combination of cash and athletic apparel. At UCLA, for 
instance, roughly half of the $4.35 million will be paid in cash, the rest in 
the value of the apparel. 
</P>
<P>
 After signing its contract with UCLA, Reebok reached a similar deal with the 
University of Texas and agreed to sponsor every athletic program at Georgia 
State University except basketball. Nike, meanwhile, has all-sports deals with 
the University of Miami and the University of North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from USC and UCLA say the advertising is not intrusive and offers 
much-needed revenue for their athletic departments. Others, however, denounce 
the deals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The students are being asked to be walking advertisements," said Erwin 
Chemerinsky, professor of law at USC. "This only happens because in the college 
sports arena, we accept it. If Coca-Cola were to go to another department and 
offer to donate money in exchange for every member of that department's faculty 
wearing a bright red blazer with the Coca-Cola logo on it when they went to 
class, no one would have any doubt it would violate the 1st Amendment. I know I 
wouldn't wear it." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, both Coca-Cola and Pepsi have had sponsorship arrangements with 
several universities for about three years, but those deals pertain only to the 
soft drinks sold on campus and do not call for students to wear advertising. 
Such deals, at schools including Penn State, Texas A & M and Cal State 
Sacramento, pertain to all vending machines and beverages sold on campus. No 
Southern California schools have such agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, the practice has been for shoe companies to pay stipends to coaches 
for use in selected athletic programs -- mostly football and basketball. In 
exchange, the coach would have players wear a particular brand of shoes. Now, 
all-inclusive sponsorship arrangements are being reached more often. Although 
some of the nation's better-known coaches will retain their contracts -- USC's 
George Raveling, for example -- shoe manufacturers say they are hoping to steer 
clear of such deals in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trend is to move toward schoolwide deals," said Keith Peters, a spokesman 
for Nike. "Certain schools have good sports reputations, and with those schools 
we'd rather have the whole program." 
</P>
<P>
 Financially strapped athletic departments are usually more than happy to enter 
such deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, UCLA announced plans to discontinue its men's swimming and 
men's and women's gymnastics programs for lack of funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Women's gymnastics was later reinstated and the fate of the other two will be 
determined at a court hearing, but campus officials say that if not for the 
deal with Reebok, other programs would have come under scrutiny as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Cash-strapped students say they also benefit from the deals. 
</P>
<P>
 For Allison West, a sophomore on the UCLA women's soccer team, the Reebok deal 
meant saving the $200 she says it cost her to pay for athletic gear last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women's soccer was a club sport last year, meaning there were no corporate 
sponsors and you had to buy everything on your own," she said. "This year, I 
have four pairs of shoes, five jackets, everything." 
</P>
<P>
 That is just one reason school officials say student athletes aren't being 
exploited. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would object to any suggestion we are selling out the students," said Glenn 
Toth, UCLA's associate athletic director for corporate sales and sponsorships, 
who negotiated the deal with Reebok. "The fact of life, at least as far as 
college athletics is concerned, is that two sports are revenue-producing sports 
and 18 sports are not. If you are to have a broad-based athletic program like 
we like to have, it makes sense to offset as many hard-dollar expenses as you 
can in order to maintain that type of diversity." 
</P>
<P>
 But in making such arguments, colleges are trying to have it both ways, says 
Sonny Vaccaro, the former Nike marketing expert credited with pioneering shoe 
company deals with college coaches in 1978. Although all-sports sponsorship 
deals are a new twist, Vaccaro says, it doesn't change the fact that the 
students receive no compensation for their role. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Universities) are renting space on the student athlete's body, and he's not 
getting anything for it," said Vaccaro, who lives in Los Angeles and now works 
for Adidas. "I think there will be a time and place where some college athlete 
is going to change that." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaccaro's opinion reflects a desire shared by most marketing experts in the 
shoe industry: to ease NCAA rules that prevent athletes from accepting monetary 
compensation. That would almost certainly eliminate any need for shoe 
manufacturers to reach deals with coaches or universities; instead, they could 
select key athletes and negotiate on an individual basis, as they do with 
professional athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever Vaccaro's motivations, other experts agree that athletes are 
being used. At both UCLA and USC, for example, athletes must wear the 
logo-laden team apparel or risk not participating in sports. Even "spatting" -- 
covering corporate logos with tape -- will be permitted only in rare instances. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a student is unhappy because of the fit, or maybe because he's played in 
another brand all his life and he's superstitious, in that instance . . . the 
logo would probably be taped over," said UCLA's Toth. "There's very limited 
flexibility, but there is flexibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Legal scholars say public universities, which receive government funds, stand 
the greatest chance of being tested on such policies in court, since 1st 
Amendment rights apply only to government businesses and agencies. But that 
doesn't mean private universities are free of risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "The catch on that is, universities like USC say they are going to follow the 
1st Amendment even if they don't have to," Chemerinsky notes. 
</P>
<P>
 As yet, no such case has emerged, in part because the new, multisport 
sponsorship agreements are just now coming into use and have not been widely 
publicized. The deals, however, are drawing some criticism on college campuses 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of this changes the relationship between a university and its athletes, 
now that the athletes are explicitly being made billboards for a commercial 
company," said John Weistart, a law professor at Duke University and outspoken 
critic of corporate sponsorships in collegiate athletics. "It's becoming harder 
and harder to talk about the athletes as students, because it looks like 
they're really just engaged in a money-making enterprise for the university." 
</P>
<P>
 Weistart questions how universities can agree to such big-money sponsorships 
and continue to retain tax-exempt status from the government, which excuses 
educational institutions from revenue taxes since they are engaged in public 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a very serious question as to why the money the university 
receives is not taxed," Weistart said. "If we had a professional team that 
entered into an equipment agreement, clearly the money they receive is taxable, 
so why shouldn't the money be taxable when it's received by a university? With 
their special status come some obligations, and one of those is that they must 
remain true to their educational purpose. It would be very unfair if 
universities, on the one hand, act in a highly commercialized fashion and then, 
on the other hand, claim the special status of a nonprofit organization engaged 
in education." 
</P>
<P>
 Amid all the debate, no one disputes that student athletes have been left 
without a say. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether student athletes are, in effect, serving as billboards, Nike 
spokesman Peters said, "I'm not sure I can disagree with it. The fact is, that 
is the system in what is called collegiate amateur sports today. . . . To a 
certain extent, the schools are generating revenue both on the student 
athlete's performance and the team's performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Hoffman, a Santa Monica-based civil rights attorney, said a precedent for 
such deals already exists in practically every community. "When you think about 
it, this is not so unusual," he said. "Little League is the same thing, but on 
a smaller scale. They need the sponsorships to keep the league running, and 
everyone expects it and no one is offended by it." 
</P>
<P>
 Many UCLA students agree, though in some cases reluctantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be better if we could do it another way, but I don't think that's 
possible," said Michelle Regul, a member of the school's spirit squad, which 
also is covered by the deal. "They're going to get the shoes from one of the 
big shoe companies anyway. It doesn't matter to me if it's Reebok." 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Bennett, a junior majoring in political science and a member of the 
school's football team, says he has no real qualms about the UCLA-Reebok deal. 
"The stuff is cool, and a lot of it's free, so it doesn't bother us at all," he 
said. "I'm comfortable with it. We're billboards, but we have nice shoes."

WELFARE REFORM RHETORIC RINGS HOLLOW IN THE DELTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH SHOGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sitting in the tidy shack of a house she rents for $140 a month, Diane Walker 
is complaining about the severely slanted floor, the broken electrical fixtures 
and the water that rushes through the roof when it rains. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a still more hopeless tone, she laments her dismal prospects for 
bettering her family's lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been looking for a job for about three years," said Walker, 32, adding 
that she has filled out applications at every factory and store in the area. 
"But you can't make somebody hire you." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many of the people living in the cheap houses, trailers and barrack-type 
apartments in her neighborhood, Walker supports herself and her three children 
with public-assistance checks and food stamps. Her sense of being trapped in 
the welfare system is common in the Mississippi Delta, a region where too few 
jobs and inadequate schools combine with other vestiges of a racist society to 
make poverty particularly intractable. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials designing welfare reform acknowledge that "ending welfare as 
we know it" -- President Clinton's professed goal -- may be impossible here and 
in other rural regions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration hopes to break the vicious cycle of welfare dependency by 
limiting Aid to Families With Dependent Children to a maximum of two years and 
by guaranteeing public service work for those who cannot get private sector 
jobs after two years on welfare. The Administration is still working out the 
financial details of its reform proposal, which it intends to submit to 
Congress late this month. 
</P>
<P>
 But the "two years and out" formula may not make sense in chronically poor, 
remote areas where training, child care and jobs are in desperately short 
supply. Presidential adviser Bruce Reed, chairman of the group designing the 
welfare reform package, said these areas may have to be exempted from the 
two-year limit. 
</P>
<P>
 "That system will not work here," said Robert Gray, Shelby's mayor. "How can 
people go to work if there are no jobs? Jobs can't be created that fast. 
Where's the money going to come from?" 
</P>
<P>
 There are a lot of Shelbys in the United States. While the debate on welfare 
reform has centered on places such as South-Central Los Angeles, a quarter of 
the national poverty population in 1992 -- 9.5 million people -- lived in 
non-metropolitan areas. The poverty rate in rural areas was 17%, much higher 
than the national average of 11%. 
</P>
<P>
 According to experts, about half of the rural poor live in areas plagued by 
persistent poverty, including the Mississippi Delta, Appalachia, South Texas, 
the "black belt" from southern Alabama to South Carolina and the Native 
American reservations of the Southwest and northern Plains states. For the 30 
years between 1960 and 1990, 540 counties, most of them in these regions, have 
consistently had poverty rates of more than 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ending welfare as we know it assumes that the opportunities are there but 
people are not motivated to take them," said Mark Rank, an associate professor 
at Washington University in St. Louis and author of "Living on the Edge," a new 
book on welfare. "But if you go to the Mississippi Delta or Appalachia, you'll 
find lots of willingness to work, but there are no jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the cities and their suburbs are where the jobs are, many rural 
welfare recipients do not want to -- or cannot -- move there. The cost of 
moving is too great, and they lack the necessary education and skills to earn 
more than a minimum wage. They believe that their children would be worse off 
in economically depressed urban areas, where they would probably have to live. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we ask the question: 'Why don't they move?' we are ignoring that there's 
much else besides jobs that get people through their lives," said Janet 
Fitchen, an anthropologist at Ithaca College in New York. "Many poor people 
could not survive without their kin network." 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Wade, a 23-year-old mother of four who lives in Itta Bena, another 
Mississippi Delta town south of Shelby, has such a network right where she is. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade said she has tried to get a job since she dropped out of high school in 
the 11th grade. She knows there are more jobs in Jackson, the state capital, 
where she regularly takes one of her children for medical treatments. But she 
said she cannot imagine moving there. 
</P>
<P>
 Although her house is modest and her resources scant in Itta Bena, she has a 
support system there. Her mother, who lives down the block, is especially 
involved in the rearing of her eldest son, who was born when Wade was only 13 
and views his grandmother as a second mother. The father of her three younger 
children lives nearby and often takes care of them. She never lacks a helping 
hand in times of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade, who has been on welfare for 10 years, said she and her friends are 
concerned about news reports that Clinton would limit benefits for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are going to be a lot of frustrated people when they cut off AFDC 
checks," she said. "If they cut AFDC, there ought to be someplace for us to 
work. I've been to McDonald's, I've been to the (cat)fish plants. No jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Another goal of the Administration's welfare reform effort, promoting 
two-parent families, also will bump up against harsh reality in the Delta, 
where many men can find only seasonal work at best and cannot support families. 
Although the father of her younger children wants to get married, Wade said, 
she does not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not ready for marriage," she said. "I feel I'm too young." When pressed, 
she admitted that part of the reason is that her boyfriend has never held a 
steady job. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade's response is a common one in areas of concentrated poverty, according to 
Cynthia Duncan, a professor at the University of New Hampshire who has been 
studying poor young adults in the Delta, Appalachia and New England for three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both men and women say they are not ready for marriage, even if they have a 
few children," Duncan said. "It's a very sensitive and difficult issue. People 
separate the decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Delta, she said, the remains of a racist social structure make it 
impossible for many young men to provide for families. When unskilled workers 
were no longer needed on the plantation, manufacturing plants moved South and 
hired them as cheap, non-union labor. But now many of those factories have 
closed, searching for still cheaper labor across the border with Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Left behind in Shelby are 3,000 people, many of them living in virtual 
shanties. Grocery store cash registers hold more food stamps than cash. The 
land that was cleared years ago and equipped with utilities for an industrial 
park is used as a baseball field. Lumber mills that once employed much of the 
town's work force are abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shelby used to be a thriving community," said Gray, who is the town's only 
black owner of a manufacturing company. "That's changed as whites moved out. 
Blacks have become the greater part of the population -- more than 90% -- but 
blacks don't go into business." 
</P>
<P>
 Gray knows personally the challenges that await Shelby's graduating high 
school seniors. He spent more than six years looking for financing for his 
Griffin Lamp Co. before the local bank opened a line of credit to him a few 
months ago. He was immediately able to double his staff to 30 and set a string 
of monthly sales records. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Hunter, the new principal of Shelby's Broad Street High School, said he 
is shocked by how poorly his students have been educated in the town's 
elementary schools. "These people are way behind," he said. "Somehow or another 
they have gotten left out in many areas of life." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Nash, U.S. undersecretary of agriculture for small community and rural 
development and a native of the Mississippi Delta, said he understands the many 
complicated reasons for poverty's grip on Shelby and other towns across the 
Deep South. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a number of reasons for the persistence of poverty in the South, 
including the vestiges of racism," he said. "You don't solve that problem 
overnight." 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, he said, there was no demand for educated workers in this 
largely forgotten corner of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "You didn't need a cotton picker or factory worker to have a four-year degree 
or even a high school diploma," he said. "Historically there has been 
under-investment in human capital in the region. It takes years to change that. 
There's no magic wand." 
</P>
<P>
 Nash said the Administration hopes to accelerate change through a range of 
initiatives that will provide federal money to help people start businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you didn't do anything else but welfare reform in rural areas, then you 
wouldn't do much good," said Nash, who was a state economic development 
official on the Arkansas side of the Delta when Clinton was that state's 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
 But he acknowledged that moving people from welfare to work, which is so 
difficult in the nation's cities, will be harder in off-the-beaten-track places 
such as this. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tougher because of isolation, because the TV cameras don't go there," he 
said. "It's not on the national radar screen as much as the urban areas are. I 
want to have the whole country to pay attention to rural America. Rural America 
needs to be part of the American Dream."

NEW U.S. NUCLEAR POLICY TO FOCUS ON 'ROGUE' REGIMES; STRATEGY: AMERICA BEGINS 
TO DEVISE WAYS TO CONFRONT INEVITABLE SPREAD OF WEAPONS. PENTAGON IS CALLING 
THE PLAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has launched what amounts to a quiet revolution in 
the United States' long-term strategy for stopping the proliferation of nuclear 
weapons, easing U.S. policies that have been in place for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The thrust of the new, less idealistic approach is to accept as a fact of life 
that the spread of technology has made it possible for many countries to build 
a nuclear bomb and to concentrate instead on what can be done in the face of 
this grim reality. 
</P>
<P>
 In some areas, that means acknowledging that more countries will "go nuclear" 
and working on ways to make sure they do not use their new weapons. In others, 
it means devoting more attention to military methods for deterring or 
counteracting new would-be nuclear powers around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Pentagon has been the driving force behind the unfolding series of 
changes, grabbing the initiative on non-proliferation policy away from the 
State Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We face a bigger proliferation danger than we've ever faced before," 
then-Defense Secretary Les Aspin said in a major speech last year. "The rising 
tide of technology has made denial of technology an insufficient guarantee of 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons." 
</P>
<P>
 In that speech, Aspin unveiled a strategy called "counter-proliferation," 
aimed at altering U.S. defense policies to add what he called "an element of 
protection" to the traditional approach of preventing the spread of nuclear 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 His successor, Defense Secretary William J. Perry, is expected to issue a 
major statement soon expanding on the new Pentagon strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the emphasis on military preparedness, the Administration's new 
approach of accommodating the reality of nuclear proliferation has several 
components, some of which are proving to be fiercely controversial: 
</P>
<P>
 * Generally loosening export controls. U.S. policy during the Cold War and 
throughout the Ronald Reagan and George Bush administrations had been to ban 
exports of a wide range of technology that could be used to make weapons of 
mass destruction. But the Clinton Administration is retaining controls on only 
a few especially sensitive items while opening the way for sales of many 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 * Concentrating efforts on a handful of "rogue" regimes, including North 
Korea, Iraq, Iran and Libya. Under this approach, it is not the fact of 
proliferation itself that is a problem but rather the questionable character of 
some of the governments. Critics such as Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) say that this 
approach provides a rationale for easing proliferation policy toward the many 
other nations that are not classified as "rogues." 
</P>
<P>
 * Concentrating efforts on trying to persuade other countries to freeze their 
nuclear weapons programs at low levels of development. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of trying to persuade Pakistan and India to abandon their nuclear 
weapons programs entirely, for example, the Administration has been willing to 
try initially to limit or "cap" these programs and hope that the two enemies 
will counterbalance each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rolling back" the two rivals' nuclear programs can wait until later, 
officials are now saying. Perry recently suggested a similar approach to North 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration hopes to do all these things without detracting from the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the international agreement that in the past 
had been the linchpin of U.S. policy on non-proliferation. The treaty envisions 
a world in which every nation except the five members of the U.N. Security 
Council completely forswears or abandons nuclear weapons programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Underlying these changes in U.S. non-proliferation policy are a number of 
factors, including the end of the Cold War, the Persian Gulf War with Iraq and 
the Administration's drive to increase U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
 The collapse of the Soviet Union broke up the security arrangements that had 
inhibited countries from developing their nuclear programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many nations, once secure in the framework and discipline of a bipolar Cold 
War standoff, are now forced by the survival instinct to look not just at new 
alliances but to reconsider self-reliance for security -- and therein (they) 
see a powerful attraction for nuclear weapons," analysts Roger Molander and 
Peter A. Wilson at the Santa Monica-based RAND Corp. think tank said last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The end of the Cold War also wiped out the rationale for strict international 
export controls on the sale of high technology. For decades, these controls 
were made formal in an international organization called the Coordinating 
Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, commonly called COCOM, which banned 
the sale of goods to the Soviet Union and other Communist countries. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 31, COCOM went out of existence. While Western nations are talking 
about setting up a new international regime to curb exports to non-Communist 
governments considered dangerous, they have not reached agreement yet on how to 
do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're aiming for October," Undersecretary of State Lynn Davis said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The aftermath of the Persian Gulf conflict demonstrated how easy it was for 
Iraq to develop a clandestine nuclear weapons program even while it was a 
signer of the non-proliferation treaty and was submitting to inspections of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Iraq dramatized the reality that small powers can now threaten U.S. forces 
and allies on distant battlefields with missiles and chemical or nuclear 
weapons," Robert A. Manning of the Progressive Foundation wrote recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the desire of U.S. companies for more sales overseas and the need to 
reduce the U.S. trade imbalance put strong pressure on the Administration to 
loosen at least some export controls. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're seeing now in the Pentagon is a historic shift," said Gary 
Milhollin of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control. "The Pentagon has 
abandoned its traditional support for strong export controls and is taking the 
view of the Commerce Department that the more exports the better. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the motivation for this has been pressure from (the high-technology 
industry in) Silicon Valley, which was one of the earliest supporters of 
Clinton's campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Defenders of the Administration's new emphasis on military responses to 
nuclear proliferation say it adds a needed touch of realism to the U.S. 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Non-proliferation is going to fail, at least in some cases," said David Kay, 
who served as the head of the international inspection team in Iraq after the 
Gulf War. "And the U.S. government has got to have a way of responding." 
</P>
<P>
 What Kay meant was that almost certainly there will be new nuclear powers, in 
addition to the five nations that have long had nuclear weapons (the United 
States, Russia, Britain, France and China) and the three countries that have 
acquired nuclear capability over the last 25 years (Israel, India and 
Pakistan). 
</P>
<P>
 In his speech on the Pentagon's new mission of counter-proliferation, Aspin 
asserted last December that the Defense Department will change both its 
purchasing practices and its war-fighting strategy to be better prepared to 
protect U.S. interests against threats from new nuclear powers. 
</P>
<P>
 "For example, we're looking at improving non-nuclear penetrating munitions to 
deal with underground installations," he said. "We're working hard on better 
ways to hunt mobile missiles after our difficulties in finding Scuds during the 
Gulf War." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials insisted that they have not completely abandoned past 
policies on non-proliferation but rather are refining and updating them. 
</P>
<P>
 In the yearlong dispute over North Korea, they noted, the Administration's 
approach has been the traditional one of using international diplomacy and the 
non-proliferation treaty in seeking to prevent Pyongyang from acquiring nuclear 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet foreign policy specialists outside the government said the 
Administration's heightened concentration on military strategies represents a 
dramatic change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Non-proliferation was almost a theological goal in the (Jimmy) Carter 
Administration," said Jonathan Pollack, an expert on Asian security policy. 
"Carter had a bug about it. We (the United States) spent endless hours trying 
to sign up the Indians to the (non-proliferation treaty). Counter-proliferation 
posits that you already have states with nuclear or near-nuclear potential and 
asks, 'What can we do to deal with that fact?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say one problem with the change in emphasis from non-proliferation to 
counter-proliferation is that it may give the world the idea that the United 
States tolerates those nuclear programs that have already been developed -- and 
will not try too hard to roll them back. 
</P>
<P>
 They also complain that the Administration's policy changes seem to be going 
in different and possibly conflicting directions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a fairly clear tension between the Pentagon's counter-proliferation 
policy and its policy on export controls," Pollack asserted. 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis on new military strategies seems to represent a more hard-nosed 
stance toward countries trying to develop nuclear weapons. But the 
Administration's decision to ease controls on exports makes it easier for other 
governments to obtain technology that they could use for nuclear programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last year, the Administration has loosened the restrictions on U.S. 
sales of high-speed computers, telecommunications equipment and space-launch 
technology. The President has linked the move directly to the need to increase 
U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have to worry about proliferation of weapons, but we freed up $30 
billion worth of computer exports and $7 billion worth of supercomputers and 
telecommunications exports," Clinton boasted last October. "That will create a 
lot more jobs in California, and a lot of the companies in California have 
already issued statements saying it will create more jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of strict non-proliferation policies worry that high-speed computers 
can be used for the design of nuclear weapons by helping to carry out 
simulations of nuclear explosions. And they fear that technology ostensibly 
bought for launching space vehicles can easily be put to work in building 
ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials argue that curbing the sale of technology has been 
overrated as a method for stopping nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Export controls are not the strongest weapon in our arsenal to fight 
proliferation," Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner told the Senate Banking, 
Housing and Urban Affairs Committee earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and its Western allies have not lifted all export controls. 
Instead, they have temporarily extended the controls on a few particularly 
sensitive technologies useful to would-be nuclear powers while they work 
together to try to assemble a new regime that would replace COCOM. 
</P>
<P>
 But one of the main problems is deciding exactly what countries should be 
subject to the export controls: Who are the enemies these days, and what are 
their characteristics? 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, the Administration has turned to the new concept of "rogue" or 
"backlash" states. The idea was first spelled out by National Security Adviser 
Anthony Lake in a recent article in Foreign Affairs magazine and recently has 
been adopted by other Administration officials, including Undersecretary of 
State Davis and U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright. 
</P>
<P>
 While loosening export controls to the rest of the world, Davis told a recent 
news conference, the United States and its allies will work to adopt a new 
export-control regime to counteract "threats posed by rogue countries such as 
Iran, Iraq, Libya and North Korea." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Glenn, one of Washington's staunchest advocates of strict 
non-proliferation policies, complained recently that "targeting the rogues 
allows some exporters to pay lip service to non-proliferation without 
inhibiting sales of potentially dangerous goods to other customers who 
represent much larger markets anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Other critics say it is hard to come up with a workable definition of a 
"rogue" nation that the United States and its allies can agree upon. 
</P>
<P>
 Governments in Western Europe and Japan do not believe, as the Administration 
does, that Iran should be treated as an outcast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taiwan is China's rogue nation, and India and Pakistan are each other's rogue 
nation," one congressional staff member observed. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is always possible that a nation considered responsible, and therefore 
permitted to buy sensitive technology, could later, through civil war or 
revolution, turn into a "rogue." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the Iranian revolution of 1979 gave the Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini's regime access to all the hardware that the United States had been 
selling to its ally, Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the Pentagon's new counter-proliferation strategy has raised 
questions about how the policy would really operate in practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "North Korea is a good case. We have two very threatening nuclear reactors 
scheduled to come on line in the next year or two, which will threaten the 
whole world and would be perfect targets for a strike," Milhollin of the 
Wisconsin Project said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But such a strike would provoke a war, and so it's not being seriously 
considered. Which proves to me that counter-proliferation basically doesn't 
work, and its main effect is to justify a higher budget for the Pentagon." 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of difficulties such as these, Administration officials are 
reluctant to part entirely with the traditional zero-tolerance proliferation 
policies championed by people such as Glenn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in the State Department's policy planning office in 1975, when India 
set off its bomb" in a nuclear test, said Winston Lord, assistant secretary of 
state for East Asia. "At the time, people were wondering how many other nuclear 
powers there would be in 10 or 15 years. Most people would have predicted many 
more than we have now. 
</P>
<P>
 "The basic concept has had enough success that we ought to stick with it -- 
namely, that we just don't want any more nuclear weapons. And we shouldn't get 
into the mode of thinking that some people having nuclear weapons is better 
than others. That may be true, but it's a slippery slope." Pentagon's 
Preemptive Tactics 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon's new war against the buildup of nuclear, chemical and biological 
weapons involves a new set of tactics, including: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Improved intelligence: Painstaking assembly of information on the location 
and interior layout of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons facilities -- 
including their structural weak spots. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Special operations teams: Use of non-lethal weapons aimed at confusing the 
enemy and disabling or destroying its facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Special munitions: Deep-penetrating, precision-guided munitions that could 
pinpoint the vulnerable parts of an underground nuclear facility and pierce its 
protective bunker. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Missile hunters: High-technology missile-hunting equipment that can locate 
and destroy mobile missile-launchers, such as SCUDS. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Export controls: More narrowly focused export controls to deny shipments of 
sensitive technology to rogue countries such as Iran, Iraq, Libya and Noth 
Korea.

HAITIAN HEARINGS TO BE HELD AT SEA; REFUGEES: CLINTON SAYS HE RECOGNIZES THE 
'VALID FEARS' OF ASYLUM SEEKERS WHO NOW ARE RETURNED TO THEIR CHAOTIC HOMELAND. 
HE ALSO APPOINTS A NEW ADVISER ON HAITI. 
</P>

<P>
 Under intense pressure from activists charging that his policy is endangering 
the lives of thousands of Haitians, President Clinton confirmed Sunday that he 
will soon begin providing offshore hearings for refugees seeking political 
asylum in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, those intercepted at sea are returned to Haiti for interviews and 
processing of their claims to political asylum. Often, they are met at the 
docks by Haitian authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "In recent months, however, I have become increasingly concerned that Haiti's 
declining human rights situation may endanger the safety of those who have 
valid fears of political persecution," Clinton said during a news conference at 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 The President also announced the appointment of United Negro College Fund 
President William H. Gray III to be his special adviser on Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 He lauded Gray, a former Pennsylvania congressman and member of the House 
Democratic leadership, as "a man of vision and determination, of real strength 
and real creativity." He said Gray will be the Administration's "point man" in 
diplomatic efforts and be heavily involved in its policy deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray replaces veteran Ambassador Lawrence Pezzullo, who was forced out after 
being viewed as too closely linked to a failed U.S. effort to pressure exiled 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide into a compromise with the military regime. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's announcement came just days after the Administration persuaded 
the United Nations to toughen its economic embargo against Haiti in its drive 
to force the military government from power. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton conceded that his new policy on refugees will mean that more Haitians 
will be allowed into this country but insisted that it will not produce a flood 
of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 "As violence has increased, we wanted to make sure that people who are fleeing 
on boats have an opportunity to assert those claims outside of Haiti before 
they are taken back and turned over to Haitian authorities," Deputy National 
Security Adviser Samuel (Sandy) Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amnesty International reported last week that 139 of 904 Haitians forcibly 
returned since the start of this year had been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Other studies have said at least 3,000 Haitians have been killed in 
politically related violence since Aristide was overthrown in September, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Berger, appearing on NBC's "Meet the Press," said the only solution is for 
Haiti's military leaders to step down and allow Aristide to return to power. 
</P>
<P>
 Berger said the decision on how to deal with refugees will affect only a 
"small group" of Haitians: those who are fleeing political persecution rather 
than merely seeking economic betterment. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 95% of the people coming in are not political refugees," he said. "I 
don't think the numbers are going to be overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the federal government will try to spread any refugees admitted among 
several states so that Florida does not bear the entire burden. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not want to encourage people to leave on boats. We will continue 
in-country processing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Berger said the economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations last week are 
"the toughest sanctions ever imposed in this hemisphere." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the United States will work with the Dominican Republic, which shares 
Haiti's only land border, to "do our very best to seal that border." 
</P>
<P>
 As for military intervention, Berger said the Administration wants to try to 
push the military regime out through economic sanctions first. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall Robinson, head of the TransAfrica lobbying group, said Sunday he is 
ending a 27-day hunger strike after National Security Adviser Anthony Lake told 
him by telephone of the new policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will end my hunger strike today," Robinson said on NBC's "Meet the Press." 
</P>
<P>
 He commended Clinton for reversing the policy of forcible return. 
</P>
<P>
 "With it, we have saved hundreds, if not thousands, of lives. I think it is an 
important step, and the President deserves praise for it," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Haitian military leader Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, also interviewed on "Meet the 
Press," called for new negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to believe that people will get back to their senses and will think 
that on our side we have always favored dialogue since the beginning of the 
crisis," he said through an interpreter. "The sanctions are not a policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Berger said the Administration had attempted negotiations for 14 months and 
concluded that Cedras was not serious. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), who was arrested while protesting outside 
the White House on Thursday, said on "Meet the Press": "I'm very pleased that 
the President has changed his policy.

NORIEGA PARTY CLAIMS VICTORY IN PANAMA RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who U.S. troops captured and interrogated during the 1989 invasion that 
ousted Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega claimed victory Sunday in Panama's freest 
presidential elections in decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernesto Perez Balladares, candidate of the political party that served as a 
front for Noriega's dictatorship throughout the 1980s, was leading a field of 
seven contenders with 52% of the vote counted, the national Election Tribunal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A trend has been maintained that indicates we won these elections," Perez 
Balladares said in a news conference late Sunday at a Panama City hotel. "The 
trend is irreversible." 
</P>
<P>
 He had about a third of the vote and was followed by Mireya Moscoso de Gruber 
of the ruling Arnulfista Party. One exit poll conducted for Panamanian 
television gave second place to salsa musician and Hollywood actor Ruben 
Blades, but he trailed in the official returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Panama's first presidential election since the invasion was seen as a test of 
whether democracy will take root in this country after a long history of 
domination by the army or the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time in 25 years that Panamanians could choose a president 
without the specter of military dictatorship, and the first time in more than 
three decades that the results were likely to be respected. 
</P>
<P>
 The new government will be responsible for preparing Panama to take over the 
vital Panama Canal in the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 The past ties of Perez Balladares' Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) to 
Noriega and the military worried and frightened opponents. But the candidate 
was apparently able to conserve his party's traditional base while tapping into 
a strong protest vote among Panamanians angry at the pro-business government of 
President Guillermo Endara, which to many seemed inept and uncaring toward the 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's voting was, on the whole, orderly. Numerous polling stations opened 
late as workers awaited the arrival of cardboard ballot boxes. But few other 
problems and no major incidents of violence were reported, in marked contrast 
to past elections, where voters were often intimidated, ballots stolen and 
results canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter led a team of more than 1,200 international 
observers who were deployed throughout the country to guarantee clean voting. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time Panamanians tried to vote for president, in May, 1989, Noriega 
annulled the results when his handpicked candidate, Carlos Duque, lost to 
Endara. Endara and his vice presidential candidates were roughed up by 
Noriega's agents, and a few months later the invasion was launched. 
</P>
<P>
 The invading troops swore Endara into office at a hasty ceremony on a U.S. 
military base. Noriega was eventually captured and is serving a 40-year 
drug-trafficking sentence in a Florida prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez Balladares, known as "the Bull" because of his hefty build, is a 
longtime leader of the PRD. He ran Duque's campaign and continues to be 
surrounded by several party stalwarts who were close to Noriega or who were 
linked to corruption in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 But Perez Balladares, a millionaire businessman schooled at the University of 
Pennsylvania and Notre Dame, campaigned tirelessly to distance himself and the 
party from Noriega. He insisted that the party has been restructured and purged 
of many Noriega collaborators. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today's party has nothing to do with Noriega," he said in an interview last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, the U.S. government is neutral in the elections, and Clinton 
Administration officials said they will work with whoever wins. But the irony 
of the return of a party ousted by the invasion was lost on no one. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you support democracy," one diplomat said, "sometimes you get better, 
and sometimes you get worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez Balladares, 47, has said he will consider renegotiation of the Panama 
Canal treaties, which require 10,000 U.S. troops stationed here to withdraw by 
the year 2000. Many Panamanians fear that closing the U.S. military bases will 
deal a devastating blow to the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 On the night of the invasion -- Dec. 20, 1989 -- Perez Balladares, as a senior 
PRD militant, was arrested by U.S. troops and questioned for several hours 
before being released, he said. He also said his house was ransacked and his 
elderly parents held at gunpoint. Nevertheless, Perez Balladares says his 
relations with U.S. officials are now cordial. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to block his victory, Endara broadcast videotapes last month that 
showed several PRD candidates carousing with and praising Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
 Blades, who put his movie career on hold to run for president, returned to 
Panama from his home in Santa Monica after an absence of nearly two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Although an exit poll gave Blades a second-place finish, Gruber surged in the 
partial returns and trailed Perez Balladares by only five points. 
</P>
<P>
 As the remarried widow of legendary Panamanian perennial President Arnulfo 
Arias, Gruber is blessed with a well-organized party machine that is especially 
adept at turning out voters in the countryside and other cities nationwide. She 
had languished in third or fourth place in most public opinion polls going into 
Sunday's election.

HILL'S TRIAL IN CAPITOL PROBE TO BEGIN TODAY; COURTS: THE CASE IS PART OF A 
FEDERAL INVESTIGATION THAT HAS BROUGHT SEVERAL CORRUPTION CONVICTIONS. THE 
STATE SENATOR FROM WHITTIER SAYS HE IS INNOCENT AND UPBEAT ABOUT HIS PROSPECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six years after becoming the target of a political corruption investigation, 
state Sen. Frank Hill (R-Whittier) is scheduled to go on trial today, the first 
Republican lawmaker to stand trial in the decade-long probe of the influence of 
money in the state Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm upbeat. I look forward to getting it all over with," said Hill, who 
expects to testify on his own behalf during what is expected to be a four- to 
six-week trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, 40, will face a group of federal prosecutors who hold an impressive 
record. They have won a dozen convictions, including those of four Los Angeles 
County lawmakers, two lobbyists, three legislative aides, a coastal 
commissioner and two Sacramento-area officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's is the only case still pending in the investigation, officially known 
as Brispec (bribery-special interest), but it may not close the books on the 
unprecedented probe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until we have exhausted every investigative lead . . . I will not declare the 
operation to be closed," said U.S. Atty. Charles J. Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
 In an apparent reference to former Coastal Commissioner Mark Nathanson and 
lobbyist Clayton R. Jackson, Stevens noted in an interview that several people 
convicted in the probe are "in a position to provide relevant information to 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 "In addition to the upcoming trial, we are still reviewing a number of 
investigative leads," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial in a courtroom just a few blocks from the Capitol, 
prosecutors will attempt to show that Hill is guilty of three counts of 
extortion, money laundering and conspiracy related to an elaborate FBI sting 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Each count carries a maximum possible penalty of 20 years in prison and a fine 
of either $250,000 or $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 All the charges stem from Hill accepting a $2,500 honorarium in 1988 from an 
FBI agent masquerading as a Southern businessman seeking legislation to help 
establish a shrimp processing plant in West Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors allege that Hill violated the law when he received the honorarium 
and deposited the check, allegedly in exchange for his support for the shrimp 
bill. But his lawyers stress that Hill first voted for the proposal in 1986 -- 
two years before he was even approached by an undercover agent -- and again in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's lawyers maintain that "there was never any connection" between his 
receipt of the honorarium and his action on legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill has been waiting for nearly six years to clear his name. The undercover 
sting surfaced after FBI agents armed with search warrants raided the Capitol 
offices of Hill and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite publicity about the sting, Hill won reelection to the Assembly and in 
1990 captured a Senate seat in a special election. He later won a full term. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill is an affable and glib onetime congressional aide who emerged as a rising 
Republican star after he won an Assembly seat in 1982 at the age of 28. He 
immediately became a GOP point man on curbing bilingual education, and his 
career appeared to be on a fast track. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's ambition to run for statewide office has been thwarted by the probe 
and, especially, by his 1993 indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal grand jury charged Hill, former Assembly GOP Leader Pat Nolan of 
Glendale and Terry B. Frost, a onetime Senate Democratic aide, contending that 
they had conspired to extort payments from an undercover FBI agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost, 44, also goes on trial today. He is charged with conspiracy to commit 
extortion. 
</P>
<P>
 In a surprise move, Nolan in February pleaded guilty to one racketeering 
charge, resigned his office, and is serving a 33-month prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Critical to the prosecution's case against Hill and Frost will be the 
testimony of Karin L. Watson, a former top aide to Nolan who is expected to 
provide the jury with a road map of the alleged conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson, 47, has pleaded guilty to a felony extortion charge and agreed to 
testify against Hill. As part of her plea bargain, prosecutors agreed to a 
sentence of probation or six months in a halfway house or treatment center. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson is expected to spell out the influence staff members such as herself 
and Frost were able to exert on the passage of legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the prosecution's case is a pivotal taped meeting prosecutors 
say Watson and Hill had with the undercover FBI agent in June, 1988, in a suite 
at the Hyatt Hotel across from the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 At the session, an undercover agent paid the $2,500 honorarium to Hill, then 
one of Nolan's top lieutenants. Prosecutors allege that the money was in 
exchange for Hill's assistance in rounding up votes for the bill introduced as 
part of the undercover sting operation. 
</P>
<P>
 During the meeting, prosecutors said, Hill assured the agent that he and Nolan 
would do "everything" they could to persuade then-Gov. George Deukmejian to 
sign the measure. Deukmejian, informed by the FBI about the bogus nature of the 
bill, vetoed the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 In pretrial documents, Hill's lawyers contend that there was no wrongdoing, 
saying that "at no time during the meeting was there any intimation that the 
honorarium was to be paid to Hill for his support of the bill," said Stephen D. 
Miller, the Los Angeles lawyer representing Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Miller seeks to cast doubt on Watson's credibility by maintaining 
that sometimes, when she bragged to undercover agents about Hill's assistance 
on the shrimp legislation, she was drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was frequently inebriated in her dealings with the agents," according to 
Miller's pretrial documents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The agents took advantage of her tendency to drink," Miller said, adding that 
"she was given to making exaggerated statements and boasts." 
</P>
<P>
 Clyde Blackmon, Watson's lawyer, declined to comment on Miller's contention. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost, charged with conspiracy to commit extortion, was allegedly the 
go-between who introduced Watson to John Shahabian, a Democratic aide who had 
become a secret government informant. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the prosecution's case, as described in pretrial documents, 
"Watson explained that the best way to get money to Hill was by an honorarium, 
stating, 'Hill would like an honorarium,' " meaning that the funds could be 
used for personal expenses, not restricted to campaign purposes.

A NEW TACK; AMERICA'S CUP ENTRY TO USE ALL-FEMALE CREW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Merritt Carey, who has sailed the world, came running when she heard that the 
first-ever all-women's team was being assembled for the America's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't get any better than this if you're looking for big boats and 
around-the-can (buoy) sailing," said the 25-year-old Maine native. 
</P>
<P>
 Other world-class races -- the Caribbean Gold Cup, the Transpacific, the 
Whitbread Round-the-World Race -- are challenging and high profile, but in the 
world of big-time sailing, the America's Cup is the Big Show. 
</P>
<P>
 And for 142 years, since hail-fellow yachtsmen from New York and London first 
decided to have a go at some ocean-going sport, the America's Cup has been a 
male dominion, with only a sprinkling of women crew members. 
</P>
<P>
 Phyllis Brodie Gordon Sopwith, for example, raced with her husband, the 
British aircraft maker Thomas Octave Murdock Sopwith, aboard his Endeavour in 
1934 and 1937. Gertie Vanderbilt, wife of tycoon and helmsman Harold S. 
Vanderbilt, was on the American entry Victorious during those same 
competitions. 
</P>
<P>
 But there has never been an all-female team. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Bill Koch, the bold-talking, risk-taking multimillionaire who spent $68 
million on the America 3 (pronounced "America cubed") team to win the 1992 
America's Cup, wants to change that. 
</P>
<P>
 He's back in San Diego with the sailing equivalent of sedition in his heart. 
Casting adrift his all-male winning team from 1992, it's the women's team or 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "These women are going to make history," Koch promised one overcast morning 
last week at the team's Point Loma compound. "They are going to show that with 
a fast boat, a good attitude and teamwork, they can beat the men and the old 
tradition of sailing." 
</P>
<P>
 Four hundred women applied after Koch sent out a casting call in March. Fifty 
-- including engineers, world-class athletes in other sports and some Olympians 
-- were selected to come to San Diego to compete for 22 spots. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a sport you take up easily, like jogging," said team hopeful Mary 
Brigden Snow, 34, a pilot in the Navy reserves in San Diego. "You have to be 
strong and you have to be smart. It draws on the complete person." 
</P>
<P>
 If there was an unspoken criterion for volunteers, it was: no prima donnas 
need apply. Sailing, especially America's Cup sailing, which throws a 16-person 
crew aboard a 75-foot-long boat, requires team players, not individual stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't really compete with the person next to you," said Courtenay Becker, 
29, a windsurfer and sailor from The Dalles, Ore. "You have to work with the 
person next to you." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the finalists arrived with little sailing experience, but with plenty 
of the requisite strength, athleticism and gung-ho attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "The novices started by learning about tack, jib and port and starboard," said 
Leslie Egnot, 31, from New Zealand, silver medalist in women's sailing at the 
1992 Olympics. "Now they're out there doing tack-sets and Mexican drops like 
everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelley Beattie, 27, from Malibu, is known to America as "Siren" on the weekly 
television show "American Gladiators." She's a bodybuilder, a kayaker and a 
power lifter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm built right to be a grinder," said Beattie, cheerfully displaying 
cannonball-like biceps. The grinders work the wenches that help raise and trim 
the sails, an arduous assignment that tests speed, power and endurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Koch, 53, a Kansan who inherited hundreds of millions from his father's oil 
refinery business, has picked an opportune time to inject something new into 
the cup competition. The 1995 competition had been shaping up as a pale version 
of 1992, with fewer entries, smaller team budgets, a less rigorous course. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese, the French and Dennis Conner, the moody prince of American 
sailing, will have entries in 1995, but New Zealand's Michael Fay is staying 
home. The Italian team, which lost in the finals to America 3 in 1992, will 
also be absent, as will the Big Red team from Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, the boathouses are full of skeptics about Koch's current 
$25-million gambit. Sexism aside, the conventional wisdom is that any time you 
limit your talent pool to all-anything you're taking chances. An all-Great 
Lakes team a few years ago flopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet no one is willing to dismiss the idea of Koch's all-women's team bringing 
home the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anybody can do it, Bill Koch can do it," said Tom Ehman, a member of the 
San Diego Yacht Club and executive vice president of the 1992 America's Cup 
Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is typical of Bill Koch," said Kansas Gov. Joan Finney, who serves on 
the America 3 advisory board along with Whoopi Goldberg, Betty Ford, Mariel 
Hemingway and cookie magnate Debbi Fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's generous and he's creative," Finney said. "When the women come sailing 
into the harbor on Bill's boat as winners after the last race, it's going to be 
a boost for women around the world." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Koch's venture carries nautical, physiological and sociological 
significance. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Dent, former trainer of the San Diego Padres, will be building the 
women's upper-body strength, the lack of which is usually cited as the reason 
women cannot compete with men. 
</P>
<P>
 Dent, who trained the America 3 crew in 1992, says that once he is finished, 
upper-body strength will no longer be an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trunk has to be strong, the legs have to be strong, even the small 
rotator cuff has to be strong," he said. Among other muscle-building exercises, 
Dent has the candidates doing one-arm pushups before breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 The day begins at 6:30 pumping iron and running, before a carbohydrate-loading 
breakfast at a nearby Italian restaurant. By 9:30 the practice boat Kanza is 
being rigged for a full day of trial runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, the idea of making history and competing against the men is great," 
said Marci Porter, 26, from Virginia, a national rowing champion with firsts at 
the Pan American Games in 1991 and the Royal Canadian Henley in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure the men are going to neg out on us," said Beattie, which is sailing 
talk meaning to react adversely to a change in the competitive environment. 
</P>
<P>
 No one expects a team of men to take losing to women lightly. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not going to handle it well at all," said America 3 Coach Kimo 
Worthington, a sly smile reaching his lips. "To lose is bad enough, but to lose 
to women, who most male sailors don't think belong in the America's Cup, that's 
going to be great. Absolutely."

CAPITOL JOURNAL: FOR FEINSTEIN, TAKING ON BIG GUNS PAYS OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Washington, U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein leaped from her chair and pumped 
both fists in celebration as television flashed the final House vote on her 
proposed assault weapons ban. All through the tense voting last Thursday, she 
had been lobbying House members by telephone from her office desk. 
</P>
<P>
 In West Los Angeles at Feinstein's reelection headquarters, campaign manager 
Kam Kuwata calmly picked up the phone and began calling contributors. He and 
staffers had watched the electronic voting on C-SPAN, booing whenever the 
gunners edged ahead and cheering as their boss' side took a lead. Now, he would 
call donors and provide a little personal service, giving them a heads-up 
before the evening news that Feinstein's controversial proposal had passed by a 
scant two-vote margin. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) began receiving 
interview requests from reporters looking for the California angle. He was -- 
as his campaign literature proclaimed -- "The Man Who Banned Assault Weapons" 
in California five years ago. And he had just routed the gun lobby in its 
attempt to recall him. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Roberti would phone contributors and raise $50,000 for his state 
treasurer's race. It wouldn't hurt that the U.S. House -- spurred by President 
Clinton's high-profile lobbying effort -- had just passed an assault weapons 
ban similar to his. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the thing everybody wants to talk about," Roberti says. "They don't talk 
to me about interest rates on Wall Street. (Gun control) is more interesting 
and very volatile and current. That's what they think of when I call." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats continue to cash in politically on the popular issue of gun control. 
Republicans usually have the upper hand on two other hot issues, crime and 
illegal immigration. On those matters, many Democrats shy away from alienating 
their liberal constituencies. Likewise, Republicans seem to own all salable 
"tax and spend" rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 But on firearms, it's the Democrats who are on the side of overwhelming public 
opinion. And it's GOP politicians who have been left behind, intimidated by a 
gun lobby whose vociferous bark has become louder than its toothless bite. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Rifle Assn. is "not as strong and not as smart" as it thinks, 
Roberti says. "If they were smart, they'd come up with reasonable proposals 
that met the public's need. But they just oppose everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein found out about NRA unreasonableness. Last year, the senator sent a 
draft of her legislation to the NRA and asked for suggestions. "What I got back 
was nothing," she says. "I called and was told that the NRA board had met and 
decided to oppose it, but nobody had told me." 
</P>
<P>
 An influential colleague tried to discourage her. The rookie senator sought 
counsel from Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee and was advised that her cause was hopeless. Trying to amend an 
assault weapons ban into the Senate crime bill "could bring down the whole 
crime bill," Biden warned, according to Feinstein. "But he said it would be a 
good lesson for me if I wanted to try." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein amended the crime bill, and it wasn't brought down. Then, working 
the talk shows, victims groups and reluctant colleagues nonstop, she helped 
Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) pass a separate bill in the House. Next, a 
conference committee is expected to amend the proposal into a final crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, the consensus is that none of this will have a big impact on 
pending state gun bills. The California Legislature already has banned most 
assault weapons and imposed a waiting period for gun purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it is considering the next moderate steps -- including licensing for 
handgun and ammunition purchases, a handgun purchase limit of one per month, a 
reduction in clip capacities, a possible felony penalty for illegally carrying 
a concealable weapon, and a prohibition against law enforcement agencies 
auctioning confiscated firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Washington, Sacramento doesn't have a chief executive pushing for gun 
control. Gov. Pete Wilson has kept silent. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Feinstein, she's one of the rare Democrats who not only is tough on gun 
control but also illegal immigration and crime. That has put her in the 
electoral mainstream on some cutting issues. What's more, she has been out 
front, fighting more aggressively and effectively than any other rookie 
California senator in decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's ability to make an immediate mark in a legislative body dominated 
by veterans and ruled by seniority is why she now is California's most popular 
politician -- based on the latest Times Poll -- and is a heavy favorite for 
reelection.

RENO TO PROTEST MEXICO'S PLAN TO WITHHOLD SUSPECT IN RAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOYLE MCMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno and other U.S. officials plan to protest the Mexican 
government's refusal to extradite a suspect in the brutal rape of a 4-year-old 
Riverside County girl when they meet with the Mexican Cabinet here today, 
officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari personally promised to secure the 
extradition of Serapio Zuniga Rios last year, when the issue was a point of 
contention in the congressional debate over the North American Free Trade 
Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 But late last month, the Mexican government notified the U.S. Embassy here 
that Zuniga had been tried in secret and convicted -- meaning he would not be 
extradited after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Reno and State Department officials had planned to protest the Mexican 
action strongly during their meetings here, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno arrived in Mexico City Sunday night along with Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher and other top Clinton Administration officials for a two-day 
mission, one of a series of regular meetings between the two governments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are deeply shocked and disappointed by the Mexican government's actions," 
said Robert S. Gelbard, assistant secretary of state for narcotics and 
international crime issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mexican government has known from the beginning that we have considered 
the Zuniga Rios case to be of fundamental importance," he said. "We thought we 
had complete assurances from the Mexican government . . . that this man would 
be extradited. . . . If they are not prepared to extradite Zuniga Rios under 
the assurances we have gotten, under what circumstances are they going to 
extradite anyone?" 
</P>
<P>
 A senior State Department official, speaking anonymously, was blunter. "They 
lied to us," he said. "There was amazement, horror and real anger when we 
learned what they had done." 
</P>
<P>
 Zuniga, a 28-year-old Mexican national, was sentenced April 27 after he was 
convicted of sexual assault, abduction and burglary in the kidnaping of the 
girl from a ranch near Temecula in September, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 After assaulting the girl, Zuniga wrapped her in a blanket and hanged the 
bundle from a tree, according to police. Zuniga was allegedly enraged because 
he had been fired from a job at the ranch, which is owned by the girl's 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Zuniga later fled to Mexico, where he was arrested last December after an 
extensive manhunt. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of extradition has been a sore point in U.S.-Mexican relations. 
Mexico has never extradited one of its citizens wanted for crimes in the United 
States, citing concerns of national sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, U.S. agents abducted a Mexican wanted for participation in the murder 
of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena because the George Bush Administration did 
not believe Mexico would extradite him. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the two countries have drafted a "non-abduction treaty" to prevent 
similar incidents. But U.S. officials said they negotiated the treaty on the 
understanding that Mexico had changed its extradition policy, and said 
President Clinton is unlikely to sign the pact unless the policy is changed.

STRUGGLING HUNGARIANS MAKE A LEFT TURN IN NATIONAL VOTE; ELECTIONS: SOCIALISTS 
LEAD, WITH LIBERALS COMING IN SECOND. POST-COMMUNIST DECLINE FANNED WIND OF 
CHANGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stung by the poverty and insecurity that have marked the post-Communist era, 
Hungarians voted Sunday for a political about-face by choosing reformed 
Socialists and leftist liberals in nationwide elections. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 97% of the ballots counted, the Hungarian Socialist Party was 
the clear front-runner with 33% of the popular vote and leading in 152 out of 
176 individual races for Parliament seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Running second with nearly 20% was the Alliance of Free Democrats, a liberal 
party committed to broadening free-market reforms to lure new jobs and foreign 
investment to Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is quite obvious is that the voters have decided to change the present 
government," Free Democrat campaign manager Balint Magyar declared after the 
returns showed his party and the Socialists had rolled up a combined majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite considerable ideological differences, the Socialists and the Free 
Democrats have been hinting in recent weeks that they may join forces to form a 
government to replace the center-right alliance now in power. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservative Hungarian Democratic Forum that leads the current governing 
coalition was running a distant third in unofficial returns, with 11.9% of the 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Its governing partners, the Independent Smallholders Party and the Christian 
Democrats, were respectively collecting about 9% and 7% of the vote for 
parties, which will decide 210 of the 386 seats in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although we expected to do better, we have to respect the decision of the 
people," incumbent Prime Minister Peter Boross conceded once the Forum's loss 
became apparent. "The ratio could still change, but we are prepared to be a 
constructive opposition force." 
</P>
<P>
 Socialist Party leader Gyula Horn, who was injured in a car accident Thursday, 
said in a telephone interview from his hospital room that he will spend the 
next weeks seeking alliances to heal the deep rifts in Hungarian society. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am troubled by the divisions in this small country and hope for 
reconciliation, that we can lead the country out of its difficulties together," 
Horn told Hungarian TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Voter turnout of 70% was surprisingly brisk, considering the apathy among 
Hungarians as they watched their regional lead in the race for capitalist 
prosperity erode under the government's go-slow approach to the transition. 
</P>
<P>
 The strong showing of the Socialists and Free Democrats reflected the broad 
disillusionment Hungarians feel after four years of tumultuous change that has 
left most people worse off than they were under the Communist system. 
Unemployment is at 13%, and inflation is about 22%. 
</P>
<P>
 "My life reads like a tragedy over the past four years. I had a good business 
under the old regime, and now I live like a pauper," complained Erzsebet 
Radonics, a 54-year-old hairdresser who voted for the Socialists. "My costs for 
everything have skyrocketed -- rent, electricity, heat, beauty supplies. But 
now no one has enough money to go to a hairdresser, so I'm going broke." 
</P>
<P>
 Her lament was a familiar one, even among the new class of entrepreneurs. They 
accuse the Forum-led government of imposing such a repressive tax structure 
that job-creating investment is stifled and the privatization of state-owned 
industries has stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Hungarians had the opportunity to run their own businesses and boost income 
under economic reforms introduced in the 1970s that were disparaged by 
hard-liners in Moscow as "goulash communism." 
</P>
<P>
 But the entrepreneurial class that emerged from that era has tended to suffer 
the brunt of the political transition that followed the peaceful 1989 
revolution that toppled one-party rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Gyorgy Tasko, a 46-year-old bachelor, owns his own surveying company but says 
the recession in the construction industry has slashed his business. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I only took my own interests into consideration, I would have voted 
differently. But I see so much poverty and suffering around me that I felt we 
needed a change, to go back to a system that paid more attention to social 
welfare," said Tasko. 
</P>
<P>
 A second round of voting is set for May 29 to decide the majority of 
individual races.

AMERICAN ALBUM: NUCLEAR TESTING NO LONGER SUPPORTS BOOM TOWN; THE COLD WAR'S 
DEMISE HAS IMPERILED THE FUTURE OF A DESERT ENCLAVE NEAR ATOMIC BOMBING SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When you turn off U.S. Highway 95 on the five-mile-long spur road that takes 
you to Mercury, you pass two square compounds surrounded by high chain-link 
fences. 
</P>
<P>
 They are holding areas, one for men and one for women. For years, peace 
demonstrators who periodically blocked the road into Mercury and the U.S. 
nuclear weapons test site were detained in the rocky, unsheltered pens. 
Afterward, buses hauled them away to be booked on formal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the pens are little more than relics of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 And Mercury itself may not have much of a future. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a town, this desert enclave was and is a base camp for the sprawling 
desert test site where the United States exploded 925 atomic bombs between 1951 
and 1992. But a year and a half has passed since the last "shot" in the Nevada 
desert. Whether there will ever be another one is an open question. 
</P>
<P>
 Test workers are already being laid off. Total employment for the entire 
weapons-testing program is down to 7,000 from a peak of 10,000. As many as 500 
more jobs may be lost at the 1,350-square-mile test site before the year is 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers who remain pore over the results of the most recent underground 
explosions and maintain two sites where preparations for tests were almost 
complete when President George Bush declared a moratorium in 1992. President 
Clinton has extended the ban through September, 1994, provided no other 
countries resume testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercury can be excused if its feelings are ambivalent. 
</P>
<P>
 Time was when its dormitories were filled to capacity, and communities of 
campers, trailers and mobile homes were crowded. At one time, more than 6,000 
soldiers camped in tents at Camp Desert Rock, a temporary post just to the 
south. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie theater and the bowling alley were booming in those days, as was the 
post office, the cafeteria, the laundry and all the offices and warehouses 
clustered in the valley. Scientists from Los Alamos and Lawrence-Livermore 
Laboratory regularly flew in and out of Desert Rock Airport, along with 
government officials from Washington and cargo planes bringing explosives to be 
tested. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days when tests were still conducted in the atmosphere -- bombs dropped 
from planes, suspended beneath balloons or mounted in high towers -- reporters 
from around the world were ushered through. Out on a pile of rocks called News 
Nob, they could watch mushroom clouds rise into the stratosphere. They made 
Frenchman Flat and Yucca Flat internationally known datelines during the 
strategic arms race. 
</P>
<P>
 Above ground and underground, the explosions during four decades left the 
desert floor so pockmarked by craters that high-altitude photographs of the 
area looked more like the moon than the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest atmospheric test, called Hood, created a 74-kiloton explosion in 
1957. The largest underground shot was 1.3 megatons, 65 times the power of the 
bomb that leveled Hiroshima in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 There were other memorable explosions as well. Not long after the site opened 
in 1951, a device dropped from a B-50 bomber above Frenchman Flat broke store 
windows in Las Vegas. Sedan, a 104-kiloton device exploded 635 feet 
underground, lifted 12 million tons of earth into the sky. Part of a program to 
demonstrate the utility of nuclear explosives in earth-moving projects, it 
created a crater 1,250 feet in diameter and 320 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
 With worldwide concern over radioactive materials entering the food chain, 
atmospheric tests were banned by the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty negotiated 
in 1963. Its restrictions have since been stiffened. In 1990, the United States 
ratified another treaty, negotiated during the Richard Nixon Administration, 
that limited the size of underground tests to no more than 150 kilotons. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the history of the test site, the government was able to conduct 
smaller explosions deep underground that went undetected for decades. Last 
year, in keeping with its new policy of openness, the Energy Department 
recently announced 204 tests never before acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, however, the only activity on the test site is the arrival of 
visitors to tour the craters and see the ghostly remains of the bridges and 
buildings that were erected in the desert to help experts study the effects of 
nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 They can look into the giant Sedan crater, where Apollo 14 astronauts later 
trained for their visit to the moon. They can drive into the Bixby crater, 
created by a blast that sent memorable tremors through Las Vegas. They can 
visit the site of the Apple II test, where a house was seared but Joshua trees, 
200 years old and more, survived. 
</P>
<P>
 And they can still find the trenches, now overgrown by scrub, where soldiers 
crouched, getting as close as troops have ever come to combat on a nuclear 
battlefield.

 FILLING THE BENCH: Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who President Clinton 
almost named to the Supreme Court last summer, is once again under serious 
consideration. Well-placed Administration sources say a decision could come 
early this week. . . . One reason that Babbitt has moved up in contention is 
that interest in federal appeals court Judge Richard S. Arnold, one of the 
early favorites, has declined because of his health problems. . . . Also still 
being considered are federal appeals court Judge Amalya Kearse and U.S. 
District Judge Jose A. Cabranes, who would be the first Latino nominee for the 
high court. The White House is said to have assured the Congressional Hispanic 
Caucus that if Babbitt gets the nod, Latino Rep. Bill Richardson (D-N.M.) will 
replace him in the Cabinet.

 ON A ROLL: Flush from stunning victories on assault weapons and waiting 
periods, gun-control advocates plan to seize the momentum and press Congress 
for even more ambitious legislation. The new bill, which had been moving slowly 
until now, would require a license (backed by fingerprint checks and safety 
training) to buy a handgun. It also would impose stiff fees to weed out shady 
gun dealers and would compel registration of handgun transfers. "We have a good 
foundation, but we must move forward with other sensible controls," Susan 
Whitmore of Handgun Control Inc. declared after the House voted to ban 19 types 
of assault-style guns. . . . The new bill is dubbed "Brady 2," an expansion of 
the enacted Brady bill, which mandates a five-day waiting period for handgun 
purchases. Once again, James S. Brady, the former presidential press secretary 
gunned down in the assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan, is vigorously 
lobbying the measure along with his wife, Sarah, chairwoman of Handgun Control. 
But supporters, well aware that the vaunted gun lobby can be potent even when 
wounded, are digging in for a long fight. "The majority of states already have 
licensing and registration for handguns, but putting that on a national basis 
will require a lot of education of the American public," Whitmore said.

 SOB STORIES: Tears play an occasional bit part in American politics. Remember 
when then-Sen. Edmund Muskie (D-Me.) wept over a letter in a New Hampshire 
newspaper accusing him of racial slurs? Although the letter was later found to 
be the work of a Republican dirty trickster, the incident finished off Muskie's 
1972 presidential campaign. And remember when Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) 
ended her quixotic 1988 presidential run in tears? After people snickered about 
the cry, Schroeder rejoined that "tears signify compassion, not weakness." . . 
. These days, with the President and other highnesses choking up here and 
there, tears seem to be in fashion. In fact, after Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) -- 
widely perceived as a hard-shelled hatchet man -- broke down while delivering a 
eulogy at Richard Nixon's funeral, Republican politicians at a meeting in 
Atlanta spoke of how Dole might have helped his 1996 White House prospects. "It 
showed," one Southern conservative said, "that he had compassion."

PLO POSTPONES FORMATION OF FIRST AUTONOMY COUNCIL; MIDEAST: MISSED DEADLINE IN 
TRANSITION TO SELF-RULE STEMS FROM DISPUTES AMONG PALESTINIAN LEADERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Signaling growing disarray in the leadership as Palestinian autonomy looms, 
the Palestine Liberation Organization indicated Sunday that it will not meet 
its deadline this week for naming a new governing council for Jericho and the 
Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 After three days of troubled leadership meetings at the PLO's 
headquarters-in-exile, PLO officials said the naming of the 24-member 
Palestinian Authority would be postponed until PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat 
returns from a trip to South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat is not scheduled to return until Wednesday, the day the PLO had 
initially pledged to announce the new governing body. Now, there will be no 
announcement until at least Thursday or Friday, indicating that the PLO will 
miss its first important deadline in the transition to Palestinian self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
 PLO sources said the delay stems from disputes within the PLO Executive 
Committee over who will name the council -- the Executive Committee or Arafat 
himself -- and reluctance among some key PLO leaders to serve on the governing 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Maazen, one of the architects of the secret 
negotiations in Oslo that produced the peace agreement between the PLO and 
Israel, has reportedly said he will not serve on the new council. Ahmed 
Suleiman Khoury (Abu Alaa), who had been slated for the economic portfolio and 
who led the Oslo talks, has also not given a clear commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, key Palestinian leaders from the occupied territories have clashed 
with Arafat in recent weeks over the right of Palestinian leaders inside the 
territories to have a voice in who is appointed and to have significant 
representation on the governing council. 
</P>
<P>
 Faisal Husseini, the PLO's leader in the West Bank, flew to Tunis shortly 
before last week's signing ceremony between Israel and the PLO and got into 
what PLO sources said was a shouting match with Arafat over insider 
representation on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute dramatically underscores not only growing unhappiness with 
Arafat's dictatorial leadership style but a split between Palestinians who have 
lived under years of Israeli occupation in the territories and the political 
leaders who will be returning to Palestinian lands after decades in exile. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to the PLO Executive Committee, which met throughout the weekend 
before Arafat left Sunday for South Africa, said it was generally agreed that 
60% of the membership of the 24-member committee would come from within the 
occupied territories and 40% from PLO leaders outside the territories. Arafat 
would head the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Some PLO leaders have been unwilling to accept appointments on the council 
because they are unhappy with the agreement negotiated in Cairo, under which 
Palestinians will have only limited self-rule, and only in the areas of Gaza 
and Jericho, at least until it is expanded with later negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined with restiveness among Palestinian insiders, Arafat appears to have 
his hands full pulling together a government in time for its scheduled move 
into Jericho within the next two weeks.

RWANDAN REBELS SET TO LAUNCH ATTACK ON KEY AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rwandan rebels near the capital Kigali are poised to make an assault on the 
government-controlled airport, a vital link to the outside world for U.N. and 
relief flights supplying the embattled city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously that's our target," Rwandan Patriotic Front Capt. Emmanuel Rugema 
said late Saturday as he pointed to Kanombe airport from Gasogi Hill, where 
rebels have advanced in the last four days. 
</P>
<P>
 RPF artillery and soldiers, dug in among banana plantations on a low hill, 
overlook the government army's Kanombe barracks, and the two sides clashed 
fiercely Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting around the airport would cut off the U.N. and aid agencies working in 
the capital, but the RPF says it is a fair target because government troops 
have used the area as a military base. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have asked the U.N. to make the airport neutral, but government forces 
tend to place guns at the airport and use it for helicopters which attack us," 
RPF Vice Chairman Patrick Mazimhaka said in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed out two barracks on the eastern side of the runway and said 
government artillery fired from that area. 
</P>
<P>
 On the same grassy hill around these buildings lies the wreckage of the plane 
in which President Juvenal Habyarimana was killed along with Burundi's leader 
when the aircraft was downed by a rocket on April 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Habyarimana's death sparked mass killings and fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 It is still not known who fired the rocket at the plane, but government 
soldiers have not so far allowed U.N. officials to visit the crash scene. The 
government says it has retrieved the plane's "black box" flight recorder -- but 
has not sent it for analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking the village of Kabuga recently, the RPF now controls the eastern 
approaches of the capital 10 miles away and the entire main road to the 
Tanzanian border. 
</P>
<P>
 They also control two hills overlooking the city to the south and a steep 
mountain to the west, giving them a great strategic advantage in their siege of 
army barracks around Kigali, whose streets are still mainly under the control 
of government forces and militia.

U.S. DEVELOPING ARMS, BATTLE PLANS TO AVERT NUCLEAR, GAS ATTACKS; DEFENSE: 
LESSONS LEARNED IN THE GULF WAR WOULD BE UTILIZED. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO DESTROY 
AN OFF-GUARD ENEMY'S ATOMIC BUNKERS AND LAUNCHERS IN SWIFT, INITIAL STRIKE.

<P>
 It is the year 2003 and a resurgent Iraq has invaded Kuwait -- again. But this 
time, Baghdad is brandishing a weapon that it didn't have in 1991: a nuclear 
arsenal. And it is threatening to use it if allied forces intervene.  
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. response is quick. In the Pentagon, military intelligence officers 
pool the computer data they have painstakingly collected on the locations and 
interior layouts of all of Iraq's nuclear facilities, including their 
structural weak spots.  
</P>
<P>
 Special operations teams sneak into Iraq from Saudi Arabia, fanning out -- in 
dangerous missions -- to disrupt communications at a pre-appointed hour. 
Tacticians prepare for ground attacks with special weapons, aimed at confusing 
the Iraqis and putting them off guard.  
</P>
<P>
 Squadrons of B-2 radar-evading Stealth bombers take off to drop 
deep-penetrating, precision-guided munitions that can pinpoint the vulnerable 
parts of a nuclear facility and pierce its protective bunker -- without sending 
clouds of radioactive debris across the country.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the United States deploys aircraft equipped with radar-tracking 
missile hunters that can destroy mobile ballistic-missile launchers. If any 
Scuds actually are fired, the military has a new theater air-defense missile 
system that can shoot them down.  
</P>
<P>
 The air war is noisy, destructive and swift. Within a few hours, the Iraqi 
nuclear threat is gone.  
</P>
<P>
 No such high-technology scenario is yet within the capability of any U.S. 
military commander, but if the Pentagon has its way, at least some of it may be 
a part of the U.S. arsenal by the year 2003. 
</P>
<P>
 The need is indisputable. As the United States discovered to its horror during 
the 1991 Persian Gulf War, Iraq and perhaps other Third World dictatorships are 
far more advanced in developing weapons of mass destruction than U.S. 
intelligence agencies had believed. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said that U.S. troops escaped serious exposure to chemical and 
biological weapons mainly because Iraq was afraid of provoking the allies into 
using their nuclear weapons. Next time, Baghdad may not be so timid -- and may 
have nuclear weapons as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, military analysts pointed out that of the handful of countries that 
the United States would be most likely to face on a battlefield in the next few 
years, virtually all -- Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Libya and Syria -- have some 
weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials warned that even a few of these "special" weapons, as they 
are called, could wipe out regional airfields and depots that the United States 
would need to stage a second Operation Desert Storm and seriously jeopardize 
the chances for an allied victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, until relatively recently, the Pentagon had not made much of a push to 
equip U.S. forces to meet those kinds of threats. 
</P>
<P>
 "We simply weren't prepared to deal with what we were facing in Iraq," one 
U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
 That may be about to change. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last December, the Clinton Administration launched a new 
"counter-proliferation" program aimed at equipping U.S. armed forces to destroy 
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons at the beginning of any conflict -- 
before they can be used against U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, which is only beginning to get under way, calls for a wide array of 
initiatives, from bolstering existing intelligence-gathering capability and 
developing new high-tech weapons to reorganizing the nation's military forces 
to carry out such a mission. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has also begun sounding out U.S. allies on the possibility 
of joining forces in the counter-proliferation effort. The North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization has already begun work on the broad outlines of such a 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "This really is a serious problem," said Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The United States, he said, is "behind the curve. 
. . . We need to have more tools in our toolbox" to deal with weapons of mass 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 The implications for the military are enormous. Facing enemies who have even a 
handful of nuclear weapons might preclude the United States from using bases in 
countries such as Saudi Arabia or Japan, which might quickly become skittish 
about exposing themselves to nuclear fallout. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States might be forced to find more -- and smaller -- staging areas 
rather than concentrating its deployment at a handful of bases, as it did 
during Operation Desert Shield. Intelligence agencies would be used mainly to 
locate targets, as in anti-submarine warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Pentagon would have to reshape most of its forces to enable them to 
handle the new counter-proliferation mission. It would also need an array of 
new weapons and high technology to help pinpoint -- and destroy -- weapons of 
mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of those tools are a long way off, the Pentagon is looking into 
a variety of proposals, from deep-penetrating bombs that can plow through thick 
concrete bunkers to tiny sensors -- shaped like twigs -- that can be dropped in 
the countryside to detect chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as Shalikashvili is the first to admit, the job will not be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin with, acquiring the technology and weapons is certain to be 
expensive. Some experts said it could take as much as $35 billion a year for a 
decade to finance a serious counter-proliferation program -- no easy job in an 
era of declining defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, for all the spectacularly high-tech weaponry that the United States 
displayed during the Persian Gulf War, Pentagon officials conceded that they 
still are a long way from having the technology to carry out the new 
counter-proliferation mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the initiative said they fear that it will only divert the 
Administration from traditional diplomatic efforts -- including renewal of the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty -- and expand the role of nuclear weapons into 
the counter-proliferation area. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the defense secretary's own annual report to Congress, submitted in 
January, calls for formal consideration of "whether and how U.S. nuclear 
weapons and nuclear posture can play a role in deterring the acquisition or use 
of nuclear weapons by other nations." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration, however, says it has no intention of permitting the use of 
U.S. nuclear weapons to destroy those of other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashton B. Carter, assistant secretary of defense for international security 
policy, contended that the counter-proliferation program envisions using 
nothing but conventional weapons to deal with the threat posed by weapons of 
mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our intention is to have a military that doesn't need to use (nuclear, 
biological and chemical) weapons," Carter said. "We can use conventional forces 
to prevail anywhere around the world."

CUBAN PILOT FLIES AIRLINER TO MIAMI, ASKS ASYLUM; DEFECTION: CUBANA FLIGHT 
BOUND FOR BAHAMAS IS DIVERTED AFTER CREW MEMBERS ARE LOCKED OUT OF COCKPIT. 
SIXTEEN PASSENGERS WERE NON-CUBAN TOURISTS.

<P>
 A Cuban commercial-airline pilot locked his fellow crew members out of the 
cockpit Sunday and diverted a Bahamian-bound plane to Miami, where he asked for 
political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no violence used in this diversion," FBI spokesman Paul Miller 
said. "This was a diversion by the pilot, who was alone in the cockpit. The 
pilot is in custody. He has asked for asylum. No one else asked for asylum." 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot will be turned over to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization 
Service, officials said. It was not clear whether charges would be filed. A 
message left at the U.S. attorney's office was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said the Cubana flight left Cuba about 12:30 p.m. PDT. It landed about 
3:15 p.m. at Miami International Airport, making it the latest in a string of 
Cuban-owned military and commercial aircraft that have fled to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16 passengers aboard the plane were five U.S. citizens, five Bahamians, 
two Spaniards, two Italians, a Colombian and a Canadian, federal officials 
said. They were described as vacationers on their way from Havana to Nassau, 
Bahamas. Also aboard were the pilot and six crew members, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tourists collected their baggage Sunday night and made other arrangements 
to fly to Nassau. Miller said he believed that the airline would send another 
Cuban pilot to Miami to fly the plane and crew back. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal agents identified the pilot as Basilio Garcia-Breto. 
</P>
<P>
 "The co-pilot said the pilot had asked him to go get him something to drink, 
and when he did the pilot locked the door from the inside," said Guido 
Pietroni, a 24-year-old passenger from Genova, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The co-pilot was trying to open the cockpit door with a screwdriver," 
Pietroni said. 
</P>
<P>
 The airplane, a Soviet-made AN-25 RV, is a twin-engine turboprop craft that 
can hold up to 30 passengers, the Federal Aviation Administration said. 
</P>
<P>
 INS spokesman Lemar Wooley said: "The only one the INS is going to be involved 
with is the pilot himself, who has indicated he wants to stay. The rest of the 
crew apparently wants to fly the plane back. The tourists have indicated they 
want to continue on their vacation to the Bahamas." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Havana had no immediate comment on Sunday's incident. In the 
past, Cuban authorities have commented very briefly on such incidents, 
generally condemning the defectors as traitors. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sunday's incident could be something of an embarrassment to Cuba, which is 
seeking to build up a tourist industry to earn it much-needed hard currency. 
More than 600,000 foreigners visited the island last year, and authorities are 
hoping to boost that number by nearly a third this year.

NORTHERN YEMEN CLAIMS TROOPS ARE CLOSE TO TAKING SOUTHERN CITY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Northern Yemen claimed that its troops had battled toward the outskirts of 
Aden, the southern stronghold, where the rival leadership ordered a general 
mobilization Sunday to defend the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In a radio broadcast, the south denied the claims.But northern officials 
predicted that Aden would fall by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 As Yemen sank deeper into civil war, foreigners fled on boats, planes and 
helicopters. The German military evacuated more than 200 people from the 
northern capital, Sana, to Djibouti on Sunday. About 1,500 people, mainly 
Americans and Europeans, had left by Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Embassy advised all 5,000 Americans to leave, and the French Foreign 
Ministry said it will begin evacuations today. 
</P>
<P>
 Yemen, on the tip of the Arabian Peninsula, had been edging toward civil war 
since August when Vice President Ali Salim Bidh, a southerner, walked out of 
the government. He was dissatisfied with the slow pace of integration following 
the May, 1990, merger of conservative, tribal North Yemen and socialist South 
Yemen. Bidh also accused northerners of killing more than 150 of his 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Unification was popular with impoverished Yemen's 14 million people, who 
regard themselves as one nation. But Bidh and President Ali Abdullah Saleh, a 
northerner, continued to feud, and the militaries were never integrated. 
</P>
<P>
 There were conflicting reports from northern officials about fighting Sunday 
in Lahij, north of Aden. The Defense Ministry claimed that northern troops had 
wiped out southern forces there, but the Information Ministry said fighting was 
still going on.

VOTERS REVERSE PLAN PROVIDING INSURANCE TO DOMESTIC PARTNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council's move to provide insurance benefits for all "domestic 
partners" of city employees, including same-sex partners, was reversed by 
voters after a campaign organized by a religious leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Final returns from Saturday's election showed 62%, or 45,638 votes, favoring 
repeal of the domestic-partners program to 38%, or 28,129 votes, to preserve 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 22 amended Austin's charter to limit benefits to the husbands, 
wives and other immediate relatives of city employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of Austin is fed up with irresponsible spending and morals," said the 
Rev. Charles Bullock, president of the pro-repeal Concerned Texans group. 
</P>
<P>
 He organized the petition drive that put the proposition on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved the insurance program last September. Ninety-eight 
employees had signed up -- 69 registering an opposite-sex partner and 29 
enrolling a same-sex partner. 
</P>
<P>
 The benefits would have cost the city about $130,000 this year.

ANITA HILL SEES PARALLELS IN CLINTON CASE; LAWSUIT: BUT LAW PROFESSOR SAYS 
PRESIDENT'S ACCUSER HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS HEARD BY 
COURT RATHER THAN SENATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Law professor Anita Faye Hill, whose accusations against Supreme Court Justice 
Clarence Thomas put the sexual harassment issue at the national forefront, said 
Sunday that she saw both similarities and differences between her case and that 
of Paula Corbin Jones, who has filed a federal lawsuit charging President 
Clinton with the same offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Because both cases involve allegations against highly visible and powerful 
figures, "there will be some comparisons," Hill said in an interview on 
CBS-TV's "Face the Nation." 
</P>
<P>
 But the University of Oklahoma professor added that she believes Jones has an 
advantage in the fact that her case will come before a court of law, rather 
than the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can get a fair hearing and, I believe, a better hearing than mine got 
before the Judiciary Committee," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 She also said both cases can serve an important and beneficial purpose in 
furthering the nation's understanding of what constitutes sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because they are high profile, they get people's attention and people talk 
about them," Hill said. " . . . We have to face the possibility -- and I say 
possibility -- that, in fact, sometimes people who we admire and respect and we 
want to do well may engage in behavior that is objectionable and maybe even 
against the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill warned against allowing the two cases to "create a sort of unreal picture 
of reality" that does not begin to describe the difficulties being faced by 
women who experience harassment in situations that will never reach such public 
exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Her case and Jones', she said, "almost glamorize raising a sexual harassment 
complaint, because here we have people on television, a number of people who 
are rushing to take sides on these issues, you've got an individual who is 
represented by a number of attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 "In reality, it's hard to get legal representation, it's hard to get legal 
advice, it's hard to really go forward with these cases, and there aren't 
necessarily a lot of people standing around waiting to support you and hear 
your story." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, on ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley," Sen. Bob Packwood 
(R-Ore.), who is embroiled in his own sexual harassment scandal, said he "can't 
help but have sympathy" for what the President is facing. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think the thing that intrigues me most is the way the women's groups 
look for a way to absolutely excoriate me and look for some way to attempt to 
exonerate the President. . . . I find that an intriguing double standard."

FEW OBSTACLES REMAIN TO GACY'S EXECUTION; CRIME: THE SERIAL KILLER IS SCHEDULED 
TO DIE BY LETHAL INJECTION TUESDAY. HE REMAINS HOPEFUL THAT LAST-MINUTE APPEALS 
WILL POSTPONE HIS DEATH AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN BRAUN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only a final spate of legal maneuvers remains before John Wayne Gacy is slated 
to disappear into the annals of American crime as a prolific killer without a 
conscience who swathed himself in the reassuring trappings of middle-class 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 Found guilty in the murders of 33 teen-age boys and young men, Gacy, 52, was 
expected to spend his final hours today at Stateville Correctional Center in 
Joliet, Ill., where he is scheduled to be put to death by lethal injection at 
12:01 a.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for Gacy said Sunday that defense lawyers were requesting an 
emergency stay of execution from the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals. The 
call for a delay, lawyer Gregory Adamski said, is based on a request for a 
hearing to determine whether prosecutors had failed to turn over business 
records that Gacy claims prove his innocence in at least three of the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 After Gacy finishes his chosen last meal -- fried chicken, french fries and a 
soft drink from a fast-food chain, plus fresh strawberries -- he is scheduled 
to be strapped to a gurney and hooked up to a device that will drip a lethal 
solution into his veins. The chemical mixture will sedate him, paralyze his 
muscles, arrest his breathing and stop his heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be there to watch him die," said William J. Kunkle Jr., one of 
Gacy's prosecutors and among 18 witnesses who will watch the execution from 
behind a glass partition. "For all his victims, for all the law enforcement 
people who had to deal with him, it will be a privilege to see him draw his 
last breath." 
</P>
<P>
 A flurry of appeals filed by Gacy's lawyers so far has done nothing to alter 
the timing of his execution. The Illinois Supreme Court, several county courts 
and a federal district judge all turned down challenges last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were Gacy, I wouldn't be making any long-term plans," said a weary David 
Keefe, one of the convicted killer's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Gacy's best chance, Keefe said, lay in a five-pronged legal challenge made 
last week in federal court here. But U.S. District Judge John F. Grady's 
summary rejection of that effort on Friday appeared to leave the convicted 
killer little ground for appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The final option, Keefe said, would be an appeal to U.S. Supreme Court Justice 
John Paul Stevens and, ultimately, the entire high court. But that avenue has 
proved to be of little use in death penalty challenges in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Gacy was scheduled to be transferred under armed guard to the Stateville 
prison by this evening. 
</P>
<P>
 The cramped Death Row cell Gacy occupied for nearly 14 years at Menard 
Correctional Center in the southern Illinois community of Chester was stripped 
bare last week, and his few belongings were packed into boxes. The paintings 
that once lined his walls -- self-portraits of himself in clown regalia, 
depictions of gaping skulls and Walt Disney cartoon characters -- are 
bequeathed to relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 In telephone calls made over the weekend to TV reporters and his lawyers, Gacy 
expressed impatience with the court decisions on his appeals, but he insisted 
his execution will be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He says he has plans for the 11th," the day after he is scheduled to die, 
Adamski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gacy's "gross denial" of his impending death and his tendency to mindlessly 
repeat his claims of innocence like a "human tape-recorder" is stark evidence 
that he is not mentally competent to be executed, Adamski said. 
</P>
<P>
 But to Kunkle and other state officials, Gacy is a "sociopath, a person with 
no remorse, no regards for the feelings of other people. He's an evil killer." 
</P>
<P>
 According to psychiatrists who examined him before his trial, Gacy 
compartmentalized his life, submerging his deadly impulses behind a facade of 
banality. 
</P>
<P>
 There was Gacy the politician, a Democratic precinct captain who was respected 
enough among party regulars to hobnob with former First Lady Rosalyn Carter. 
There was Gacy the clown, who appeared at parties and charity functions as the 
smiling, red-lipped entertainer Pogo. There was Gacy the contractor, a 
successful businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was "Jack Hanley," Gacy's alter ego for the predator who cruised 
Chicago streets for male prostitutes and showed up at suburban high schools 
with work offers for teen-agers. He lured both to his ranch-style house in 
Norwood Park, near O'Hare International Airport, for sexual trysts. 
</P>
<P>
 Gacy later confessed to police that he handcuffed those he decided to kill. He 
said he stabbed one victim and strangled 32 others. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Gacy's insistence that his impulse to murder arose from multiple 
personalities, one Cook County psychiatrist who interviewed him said: "Mr. Gacy 
remembers everything." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a jellyfish, a con man," said Dolores Neider, whose 19-year-old son, 
Johnny Mowery, was one of Gacy's victims. "Death is too good for him." 
</P>
<P>
 The remains of 27 people were found buried in the crawl space of Gacy's house. 
Two victims were under Gacy's lawn and four were dumped from a bridge over Des 
Plaines River south of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine remain unidentified. 
</P>
<P>
 Mowery's wallet and driver's license were found among the mementos that Gacy 
stored in a dresser drawer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I see his face on television, it hits me so hard," Neider said. 
"The hurt is endless."

RAMS OWNER MAY SELL PART OF TEAM; FOOTBALL: GEORGIA FRONTIERE CONCEDES SHE'S 
CONSIDERING A PARTNER, AND SAYS ANAHEIM OFFICIALS MUST SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVE 
THEIR OFFER FOR THE TEAM TO REMAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Georgia Frontiere, owner of the Rams, said Sunday it is looking ever more 
likely that the team will move elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like that's the way it's going," Frontiere said. "We're losing 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 Frontiere said she is now amenable to selling part of the team to facilitate 
such a move, a dramatic change from her stance four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I must say it is," Frontiere said in an interview. "I was really hoping 
things would work here. When friends and associates asked me earlier about the 
Rams moving, I told them I was doing my best to keep the team here. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now it's obvious that would financially kill us -- unless we come up with 
something different." 
</P>
<P>
 Frontiere, displaying both confidence and candor in a lengthy interview with 
The Times, fielded all questions, and said: 
</P>
<P>
 * She remains insistent on not selling a majority interest in the team. 
</P>
<P>
 * She is open to selling a non-controlling interest should that be part of a 
solution to remaining in Anaheim or the L.A. area. 
</P>
<P>
 * She has already met with representatives of another city for the purpose of 
conferring with prospective partners. She has not, at this time, met with 
anyone from Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 * She has all but ruled out the Rams and Raiders uniting in an effort to build 
a stadium that would house both teams. She said the two teams couldn't even 
agree on the staging of a charity game a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * She empathizes with fans, who are disappointed with the team's recent play, 
but believes the range of sports alternatives here make it tough for a football 
team to survive in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 * She is still reluctant to become involved in any litigation prompted by a 
move, but no longer regards it as an insurmountable roadblock in deciding to 
move. 
</P>
<P>
 * She views construction of The Pond of Anaheim as evidence that the city of 
Anaheim could keep the Rams if it were interested. 
</P>
<P>
 * She has been stung by the reaction of certain Anaheim city officials, and 
wonders if they are simply frustrated knowing they will not, or cannot, compete 
to keep the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 * She does not expect taxpayers to subsidize a football team. But it's 
business, she says, and both Baltimore and St. Louis have shown a willingness 
to do so because they miss having a football team. 
</P>
<P>
 Frontiere said she remains hopeful that Anaheim will compete with other cities 
for the team's favor. But financial concerns led her last week to exercise an 
escape clause in the team's lease for Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams served Anaheim with notice that they may leave in 15 months. The team 
paid the city $2 million as reimbursement for a $30-million bond used to expand 
Anaheim Stadium and lure the team here in 1980. The Rams must pay the balance 
of the bond if they elect to play elsewhere in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have any choice but to exercise the option, or we would have 
dropped deeper in the hole," she said. "I'm aware of our financial situation 
and the projections for what we're going to lose, and I should say, that gets 
your attention." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams turned a profit of more than $3 million last year, but expect to lose 
several million this year because of a 13% falloff in season-ticket sales, a 
$2-million loss in radio revenue, a $5-million increase in player payroll and a 
drop in TV revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tired of losing (games), really tired of losing," she said. "I want to 
win football games, and I have to find the environment or make the environment 
that's conducive to winning. It costs money to get good players." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams paid $9 million recently to acquire the services of quarterback Chris 
Miller for the next three years, and won a bidding war for Dallas pass rusher 
Jimmie Jones with a $7.7-million payoff for the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always inclined to let things go on too long, let things drift. I'm 
reluctant to change; I didn't want to move from Baltimore, I didn't want to 
leave Los Angeles and now Anaheim. I'm determined to make things work, but what 
I've probably done is wait too long" to address the financial concerns the team 
has in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I'm going to move in a positive direction whether we stay in Anaheim with 
a better deal or move elsewhere. At least I'm doing something, making something 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Most observers believe Baltimore is the leading candidate to secure the Rams, 
but that might require a legal territorial battle with Redskins' owner Jack 
Kent Cooke. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how I would react to litigation," she said. "I don't want 
complications with the league. I'm always interested in abiding by the rules. 
I'd prefer it not come to litigation, but to say that will stop me, I don't 
know." 
</P>
<P>
 John Shaw, Ram executive vice president and Frontiere's top business adviser, 
told her recently that she might have to sell a share of her team if she opts 
to move. A partner would ease concerns over potential litigation and give a new 
city a rallying point. 
</P>
<P>
 Frontiere, who is approached regularly with offers to buy the Rams, has had no 
interest in taking on partners -- until now. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something my husband, Carroll (Rosenbloom) believed in," she said. "He 
never had partners. He said never buy stock unless you're on the board or have 
control of the company. I very seldom use my powers as owner of the Rams, but I 
like to know I have them. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm more open-minded now than before. If we do decide to move to another 
city, both John and I now feel that someone in that city should have a vested 
interest -- a small interest -- in the team." 
</P>
<P>
 While other cities make preparations to woo the Rams, many Anaheim officials 
have indicated that they oppose extraordinary financial efforts to keep them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's painful some of the things that have been said. Maybe part of it is 
their pride has been hurt. I don't know if they have the ability to compete 
with other cities, and maybe their feelings are hurt because they know they 
can't compete. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm not going to bow and scrape to the city, and ask, why don't you like 
me anymore? There were a number of promises made to Carroll when he brought the 
team here and they've all been forgotten. There were going to be stadium 
improvements, practice facility improvements, the real estate . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I know a lot of things are said in the heat of anger, and I'm a good 
forgetter. I went through this process with Carroll with the move from L.A. to 
Anaheim and remember all the bad things that were said about him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still hopeful things can be worked out with Anaheim, although the city 
hasn't done anything. We kept our promise and talked to no one before May 3. 
You know, I think the fans care more than the city realizes. And the city knows 
what we need; didn't they just build an arena for the Ducks? (The city began 
building the arena before the NHL expanded.) I don't suggest taking money away 
for something like that, but where there's a will, there's a way." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw has suggested that Anaheim's only remedy to what ails the Rams is a new 
single-purpose, state-of-the art stadium. The Rams believe the present 
circumstances at Anaheim Stadium favor the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the minor tenant," Frontiere said. "I know a lot of people aren't 
interested in football and won't be interested in seeing money spent on a new 
stadium. And the recession hasn't helped; California has a lot of problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think Baltimore and St. Louis miss having a football team. The people 
seem eager to have it happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Season attendance at Ram games has plummeted in the past four years. The team 
has won only 19 of its last 64 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a fan and I'm not happy. If fans were really gung-ho for the team, 
though, win or lose, that might make a difference. It's that way in some other 
cities . . . but there are so many alternatives in Southern California for 
people. It's very, very tough." 
</P>
<P>
 When pressed about her intentions, Frontiere did not waver. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking for growth," she said. "It's like planting corn; if you don't 
have fertile soil, how is anything going to grow? I'm meeting people. I want to 
know if I'm going to have a partner, and I want to know if they're going to be 
in it for the ego or to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know how people feel, but what would they do if they were running a 
business and had a chance to explore different opportunities like this?"

EX-SUPERVISOR ROTH AIMS TO START OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don Roth sifts through his wallet for the quote he has saved. 
</P>
<P>
 "A man's not finished when he's defeated. He's finished when he quits."  
</P>
<P>
 "Nixon wrote that to Ted Kennedy after the incident at Chappaquiddick," Roth, 
72, says on a recent afternoon in the small Anaheim Hills house he shares with 
his fiancee, former model Dianne Bonnor, 37. "I'm going to carry it in my 
wallet forever." 
</P>
<P>
 When he resigned from the Board of Supervisors 14 months ago during a 
political corruption scandal in which he pleaded guilty to charges he received 
thousands of dollars in home improvements and other gifts from people doing 
business with the county, Roth says he asked himself: " 'Should I go over to 
the Disneyland Hotel and jump off the top? No. That's not Don Roth. I'm not a 
quitter.' That's why the Nixon quote is so apropos." 
</P>
<P>
 His rented, humbly decorated home above the Anaheim reservoir seems an 
eternity from the hallowed Santa Ana chamber where, earning an annual salary of 
$83,000, he helped oversee the county's $3.6-billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, instead of polished paneling and the vibrant flags of government, Roth 
is surrounded by walls hung with the colorful Southwestern folk art his fiancee 
and her 9-year-old daughter create. White orchids and pink impatiens bloom on a 
tiny patio. A blue parakeet chirps in a living room cage. A candle embellished 
with the figures of a guardian angel and child -- lit by Bonnor, she says, for 
the interview -- flickers on a living room shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing an aloha shirt and sporting a Mickey Mouse watch, Roth -- irritable 
after a day of hassling a homeowners association over a bill -- decides to pour 
himself a drink, one of the two gin-and-tonics he sips daily. "Never more than 
two," he says. "And it's Ralphs gin. When I can afford it, I like the English 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Talk of his ex-wife, Jackie Roth, peppers his conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Roth blames Jackie for his political demise and his inability to come 
up with enough money to defend himself. The charges were all about a "series of 
misunderstandings," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jackie, who is the most vindictive person I've ever met in my life, was the 
contributing factor -- she told me and everybody else that, if I left her for 
Dianne, she would destroy me politically no matter what it takes -- that I 
wouldn't have any elastic left in my shorts." 
</P>
<P>
 In a phone interview, Jackie Roth denies the accusation. "I will be most happy 
to take a lie detector test as to those remarks about me. I have it all on tape 
at the D.A.'s office that they are not looking at an unhappy, divorced lady," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth says he wanted to fight the charges, but was put off by the legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, today we have a great judicial system in America, but it's 
expensive. At one point I sat down with my attorneys, Paul Meyer and Dana Reed, 
and asked them what it was going to cost to continue. (I told them) I think we 
can defend ourselves. As a matter of fact, Paul Meyer said, 'I'd love to take 
this thing.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Then they started talking about $100,000. Well, I just got to a breaking 
point where I said it's not worth it, I can't continue at this financial level. 
The D.A. had an unlimited amount of money, which I didn't have. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sat down and told Dianne: Why should I encumber my life till I die paying 
back attorney fees? Let's just quit and start over again." 
</P>
<P>
 But Roth can't get a job. And he wants one. Badly. "Economic stability is 
extremely important to me. It's on my mind every day. You keep pulling out your 
investments. All my deferred comp was in the bank. Now, I'm spending my 
deferred comp. And I have my Social Security pension. So that's the concern I 
have." Bonnor is not employed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to give the misconception that we're on the poverty line. It's 
not just the financial thing; it's my mental well-being. I'm too young to sit 
home and watch Rush Limbaugh and soap operas all day long." 
</P>
<P>
 Roth isn't picky about the job he gets, so long as it's people-centered. It 
isn't power that he wants. As a supervisor, "I never worshiped the power," he 
says. "That wasn't the idea. I never set myself up on a pedestal and thought, 
'Look how big I am.' " He has no plans to re-enter politics at the end of the 
four-year ban that was a condition of his sentencing, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of his sentence, Roth also agreed not to lobby state officials. When 
it was disclosed last year that he was lobbying some local transportation 
officials, the district attorney's office objected. As a result, Roth has 
signed a pledge saying he won't lobby government officials "at any level" until 
the end of his probation in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't anticipate it would be so difficult to get back into the mainstream 
because I've always had a lot of success in business," Roth says. "Whatever I 
did, I did well. I have a lot of capabilities in management, dealing with 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 To a future employer, he would say: "Give me a chance. You know, a lot of 
people know me but have been shy in saying, 'Yeah, come on, work for us.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But he believes that potential employers are fearful of negative publicity if 
they hire him. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, it's discrimination against me which has hindered me for the 
last 12 months in getting any meaningful employment. Everybody wants to know 
what Don Roth is doing. And the minute I do something, it's going to make 
headlines: 'Don Roth Is Working.' I'm tired of being a whipping boy no matter 
what I do." 
</P>
<P>
 What is Don Roth doing? Spending time with the woman he calls "the most 
beautiful girl in the world" and plans to marry "as soon as I get back on my 
feet." They already wear wedding rings. "I make him wear his," Bonnor says. 
"She's very possessive," Roth replies. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst part of giving up his supervisorship is the void it left in the 
couple's social life, he confides. "Dianne and I were very much in demand for 
all of the social events, and all of a sudden, a shade drops." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, there's the 2 1/2-mile walk they take around Anaheim Reservoir each day 
and the barbecued dishes he whips up almost every night. "Mostly chicken -- and 
we're into vitamins," Roth says. "I've had to double mine to keep up with him," 
Bonnor answers. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth is active in the Anaheim Chamber of Commerce and they regularly attend 
its mixers. "I told her the other night: 'Watch out for those guys there (at 
the mixer), they're all going to try to give you eye contact.' " They attend 
services at Garden Church in Anaheim Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 They met in 1985, during his campaign for supervisor, when she was working for 
his political consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I saw her, she wouldn't even look at me. Though, of course I 
was married at the time, wasn't I?" Roth says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I did too (look)," Bonnor says reassuringly. "The first thing that struck 
me about Don was what a great guy he was, how he was always concerned about 
people. I've worked with a lot of other politicians that you knew weren't that 
concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 One day Bonnor got up her courage and gave Roth a call. "She said, 'Can I take 
you to lunch?' " Roth explains. "She took me to Neuport 17 in Santa Ana and it 
just turned into a lot of smiles, shall we say. And we've been great friends 
ever since. We didn't start dating until after I was separated." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that he has a relationship with a woman 35 years his junior doesn't 
embarrass Roth. "The age thing doesn't bother me. Though it bothers some 
people, I guess. When we see people looking at us in the market or something, 
we'll stop and give each other a hug -- give them something more to look at." 
</P>
<P>
 Most important for Roth is the fact that she has stood unwaveringly with him. 
"She has been extremely loyal, has stood by me in all my trials and 
tribulations, which is very admirable. And that's one of the great traits that 
Dianne has -- her loyalty and dependability." 
</P>
<P>
 "I love him," Bonnor says, patting Roth's back. "He has a heart of gold." 
</P>
<P>
 And there's another reason she has hung in there, Bonnor confides. "I believe 
in a higher power. I guess this has brought me a lot closer to it. It was very 
hard to watch Don be ferociously attacked almost every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Turning toward Roth, she says: "I don't think the D.A. wants you to work. They 
were out to destroy you. I think they're upset because you haven't gone down. I 
really think the D.A. wanted you to die. They wanted all your money (Roth was 
fined $50,100); they insisted that you do manual community service -- it had to 
be labor. I think they're very disappointed you're still around." 
</P>
<P>
 "We clearly wished him no ill will," responds Guy Ormes, supervising deputy 
district attorney. "As his attorney pointed out, he has done a number of good 
things for the Orange County community. However, the offenses with which he was 
charged and pleaded guilty to were clearly criminal in nature. We were 
conscientious in requiring a fair fine reflective of those crimes and at the 
same time not exceeding his ability to pay. With respect to his working or not, 
we have no interest one way or the other." 
</P>
<P>
 If Roth had it to do all over again, would he have handled things differently? 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course," he says. "Many things. Hindsight is always better. . . . I would 
have kept stricter controls that would have kept me out of this mess." 
</P>
<P>
 And when asked his opinion on the ban on virtually all gifts to county 
government officials that grew out of his case, he says: "I think it's gotten 
to the point now in the county where (a government official) can't even get a 
cup of coffee and talk to somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 Roth pleaded guilty to seven misdemeanor counts stemming from his failure to 
report gifts from local business people and then voting on county matters which 
affected them. The total estimated value: $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a sunny afternoon when Roth arrives at the Boys and Girls Club of 
Anaheim, the facility where he performed some of the 200 hours of community 
service required by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It still looks good," he says, checking out the beige paint and brown trim on 
the club's exterior. "I painted it all about seven or eight months ago. There 
was some graffiti on the back that I had to bleach out twice." 
</P>
<P>
 In minutes, a few kids surround Roth -- they remember him -- and he follows 
them into the clubhouse, handing out a hockey stick here, a ball there. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an important place for kids," Roth says. "They need a place to come 
to after school while their parents work." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Roth helped organize a golf tournament to benefit the club. "I 
have always enjoyed helping kids," he explains. "And the elderly too." And come 
September, the annual Don Roth Classic golf tourney will benefit Western Youth 
Services -- a Fullerton counseling facility for emotionally disturbed children 
-- where he also performed community service. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of the blue, Roth reaches into his pants pocket and pulls out a brown 
envelope containing a picture of him taken at the end of World War II in 1945, 
when he was a wavy-haired member of a Navy flight crew. "Suppose you could use 
this in the paper?" he asks. "Be sure they use enough of it to show my wings." 
</P>
<P>
 For a moment, Roth looks radiant and hopeful, like he belongs on this 
playground. "Just think of how young I was then," he says, looking at the 
picture. "My dad was so proud of me."

MIKE PENNER: AFTER COUNTING THE MINUTES, THIS VICTORY OVERDUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bo Jackson gathered the young Angels around and presented Chuck Finley with a 
bottle of champagne, a touching Mother's Day gift. 
</P>
<P>
 And, oh, had it been one mother of a winless streak. Six starts without 
victory. Thirty-nine and two-third innings without a victory. Thirty-three days 
without a victory. Seven hundred ninty-two hours without a victory. Forty-seven 
thousand five hundred twenty minutes without a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley had counted it out himself, usually around 2:30 in the morning, tossing 
and turning as he went. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd lay in bed, staring at the ceiling," Finley said. "There'd be this 
diamond on the ceiling. And I'd be watching guys circle it." 
</P>
<P>
 Counting earned runs didn't help, either. Finley led the league in insomnia in 
April, wondering where the forkball went, wondering what he was doing with an 
ERA taller than himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley is six-six. 
</P>
<P>
 His ERA before Sunday was six-eight. 
</P>
<P>
 You've heard of the demons that vex a man during the restless hours between 
midnight and the dawn? 
</P>
<P>
 With Finley, those demons had names. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jane Fonda. Stupid Bow-Flex commercials. Pay-per-view. I watched 'em all," 
said Finley. "I became an expert on late-night TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I kinda miss the days when you'd leave the TV on and the screen 
would go blank and all you'd hear was 'Bzzzzz.' You could fall asleep to that, 
but now, with cable, there's always something on at 5, 6 in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, Finley finally could rest. The Oakland Athletics filled the bill 
better than any bottle of Sominex could, scarcely making a peep as they lost to 
Finley, 7-0, lavishing the one-time Angel ace with a passel of season firsts. 
</P>
<P>
 First victory. 
</P>
<P>
 First complete game. 
</P>
<P>
 First shutout. 
</P>
<P>
 First friendly post-outing conversation with his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys on this team were starting to look at me like I was a leper," Finley 
said. "I'd stand up and everybody would look the other way." 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the Angels toasted him. 
</P>
<P>
 Within reason, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottle said champagne, but Finley said, "I think it was prune juice. Bo 
bought it. It must've cost him $4.95. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming from Bo Jackson, you'd have thought it would have been a $100 bottle. 
But he said one win didn't mean that much to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Bo should have consulted Buck Rodgers, who has spent the last five weeks 
trying to manage a baseball team with a starting rotation that has done 
absolutely nothing so far except rotate. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Langston made one start, then discovered loose bodies partying inside his 
left elbow. On April 12, he had to have them evicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Langston was replaced by Brian Anderson, who made six starts before breaking 
his thumb. Now Anderson is on the disabled list, expected to be replaced this 
week by Langston. 
</P>
<P>
 John Dopson made five starts, got hammered in four of them and got re-assigned 
to the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 Dopson was replaced by the man he replaced, Joe Magrane, who missed the 
season's first month while recovering from arm surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 With Finley AWOL, Mark Leiter had become the lone constant in Rodgers' 
pitching rotation. Now Leiter is a fine fellow, the central figure in a 
human-interest that continues to inspire us all, but the fact remains that he 
was released by the Detroit Tigers during spring training. He isn't supposed to 
carry an entire baseball team on his back. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley, however, was. At least until Langston made it back. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Finley dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
 He insists it wasn't due to the pressure of the load. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thought that if I did the same thing I did last year and every year, 
it would be enough. More than enough," he said. "It's not like I was going to 
spend an extra hour in the gym lifting weights so I could add another 
mile-an-hour to my fastball. I wasn't going to do leg squats to get ready to 
pitch 12 innings every time out." 
</P>
<P>
 All he had to do was be Chuck Finley. Yet through the second Saturday of May, 
he was tied in total victories with Charlie Finley. 
</P>
<P>
 Who noticed? Can you recite the entire editions of the north, central and 
south Orange County phone books? 
</P>
<P>
 In the past month, Finley suspects he received advice from every name on every 
page. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I had two stairways leading up to my head," Finley said. "Fifty 
guys going up and 50 guys going down, a constant escalator of guys trying to 
get into my brain, telling me what I'm doing wrong. I thought I was going 
crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Finley recounted the ringing in his ears: 
</P>
<P>
 " 'You're showing all your pitches.' 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Too much weight work." 
</P>
<P>
 " 'You're not drinking enough beer.' Or, 'You're drinking too much beer.' The 
same person gave me those two. I said, 'Which one is it?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Finley even got an earful while he was filling his car with gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Guy says to him, "You're Chuck Finley, ain't you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Finley nods. 
</P>
<P>
 Guy says, "What the hell's wrong with you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Finley says, "What, am I pumping the wrong way?" 
</P>
<P>
 Guy says, "No, your pitching. You ever thought about throwing a knuckleball?" 
</P>
<P>
 Finley laughed as he told that one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got as much chance of winning with a knuckleball," Finley said, "as 
Roseanne Arnold has of weighing 150 pounds. She'd have to lose an awful lot of 
weight." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe she should try the Chuck Finley Diet. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitch nine shutout innings, lose the weight of the world.

FRONTIERE WOULD DEAL PART OF RAMS; PRO FOOTBALL: TEAM'S OWNER ACKNOWLEDGES 
POLICY SHIFT WOULD HELP IN MOVE FROM ANAHEIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ram owner Georgia Frontiere said Sunday she is willing to sell part of the 
team to facilitate a move, a dramatic change from statements she made four 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I must say it is," Frontiere said. "I was really hoping things would 
work here. When friends and associates asked me earlier about the Rams moving, 
I told them I was doing my best to keep the team here. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now it's obvious that would financially kill us -- unless we come up with 
something different." 
</P>
<P>
 Frontiere reiterated she will not sell a majority interest in the team and 
said she is open to taking on a local minority partner if it would help prevent 
a move. 
</P>
<P>
 John Shaw, Ram executive vice president and Frontiere's top adviser, told her 
she might have to sell a share of the team to head off possible litigation in a 
new city. Frontiere, who is approached regularly with offers to buy the Rams, 
has had no interest in taking on partners -- until now. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something my husband, Carroll (Rosenbloom) believed in," she said. "He 
never had partners. He said never buy stock unless you're on the board or have 
control of the company. I very seldom use my powers as owner of the Rams, but I 
like to know I have them. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm more open-minded now than before. If we do decide to move to another 
city, both John and I now feel that someone in that city should have a vested 
interest -- a small interest -- in the team." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Frontiere confidently answered without objection a series of 
questions about the team's future, stating that: 
</P>
<P>
 -- She has met with representatives of another city, which she would not name, 
to discuss prospective partners. She has not met with anyone from Baltimore, 
which is offering to build a $160 million stadium with rent of $1 per game. St. 
Louis has a similar stadium under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 -- She denied persistent rumors that the Disney Co. will buy the Rams. She 
said she had planned to consult with friend Frank Wells, Disney's president and 
chief operating officer, but he died April 3, and she now knows no one at 
Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 -- She all but ruled out the Rams and Raiders uniting to build a stadium for 
both teams. She said the teams couldn't even agree on the staging of a charity 
game a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 -- She empathizes with fans, who are disappointed with the team's recent play, 
but says the numerous entertainment alternatives in the area make it difficult 
for a football team to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 -- She is reluctant to be involved in litigation necessitated by a move, but 
no longer regards it as an insurmountable roadblock. 
</P>
<P>
 -- She points to the construction of The Pond of Anaheim, and says if Anaheim 
wants to keep the Rams, city officials will find a way. 
</P>
<P>
 -- She has been stung by the reaction of some Anaheim city officials, and says 
it might be the result of frustration from knowing they will not, or cannot, 
compete to keep the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 -- She does not expect taxpayers to subsidize a football team. But it's 
business, she says, and Baltimore and St. Louis have shown a willingness to do 
so, "because they now miss not having football." 
</P>
<P>
 Frontiere says she remains hopeful Anaheim will compete with other cities for 
the team, but that financial concerns forced her to exercise an escape clause 
in the team's Anaheim Stadium lease last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams served Anaheim with 15 months' notice and a $2-million deposit on a 
$30-million bond used to expand Anaheim Stadium and lure the team here in 1980. 
The Rams must pay the balance of the bond if they play elsewhere in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have any choice but to exercise the option, or we would have 
dropped deeper in the hole," she said. "I'm aware of our financial situation 
and the projections for what we're going to lose, and I should say, that gets 
your attention." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams turned a profit of more than $3 million last year, but Frontiere said 
the team will lose several million this year because of a 13% drop in 
season-ticket sales, a $2-million loss in radio revenue, a $5-million increase 
in player payroll and a drop in TV revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tired of losing (games), really tired of losing," she said. "I want to 
win football games, and I have to find the environment or make the environment 
that's conducive to winning. It costs money to get good players." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams paid $9 million recently to sign quarterback Chris Miller for the 
next three years, and won a bidding war for Dallas pass rusher Jimmie Jones 
with a $7.7-million contract over three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always inclined to let things go on too long, let things drift," she 
said. "I'm reluctant to change . . . I didn't want to move from Baltimore, I 
didn't want to leave Los Angeles and now Anaheim. I'm determined to make things 
work, but what I've probably done is wait too long" to address the Rams' 
financial concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I'm going to move in a positive direction whether we stay in Anaheim with 
a better deal or move elsewhere. At least I'm doing something, making something 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore is believed to be the leading candidate to secure the Rams, but that 
might require a legal battle with Redskin owner Jack Kent Cooke, who plans to 
move his team to nearby Laurel, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd prefer it not come to litigation, but to say that will stop me, I don't 
know," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 While other cities seek the Rams, Anaheim officials are yet to offer a 
competitive proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's painful some of the things that have been said," Frontiere said. "Maybe 
part of it is their pride has been hurt. I don't know if they have the ability 
to compete with other cities, and maybe their feelings are hurt because they 
know they can't compete. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm not going to bow and scrape to the city, and ask, 'Why don't you like 
me anymore?' "I know a lot of things are said in the heat of anger, and I'm a 
good forgetter. I went through this process with Carroll with the move from 
L.A. to Anaheim and remember all the bad things that were said about him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still hopeful things can be worked out with Anaheim, although the city 
hasn't done anything. We kept our promise and talked to no one before May 3. 
You know, I think the fans care more than the city realizes. And the city knows 
what we need . . . didn't they just build an arena for the Ducks? I don't 
suggest taking money away for something like that, but where there's a will, 
there's a way." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw has suggested Anaheim's only hope is to build a new single-purpose, 
state-of-the art stadium. The Rams believe circumstances at Anaheim Stadium 
favor the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the minor tenant," Frontiere said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance has dropped the last four years, when the team has won only 19 of 
its last 64 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a fan and I'm not happy," she said. "If fans were really gung-ho for the 
team, though, win or lose, that might make a difference. It's that way in some 
other cities. . . . but there are so many alternatives in Southern California 
for people. It's very, very tough." 
</P>
<P>
 And her goals? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking for growth," she said. "It's like planting corn . . . if you 
don't have fertile soil, how is anything going to grow? I'm meeting people. I 
want to know if I'm going to have a partner, and I want to know if they're 
going to be in it for the ego or to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know how people feel, but what would they do if they were running a 
business and had a chance to explore different opportunities like this?"

HE'S FUELED BY FAILURE OF YEAR AGO; AUTO RACING: AFTER FAILING TO QUALIFY FOR 
THE FIELD IN 1993, RAHAL RETURNS TO INDIANAPOLIS SEEKING REDEMPTION.

 Raindrops pelting the windows of the motor home in the speedway paddock had 
only served to heighten Bobby Rahal's frustration at not getting his new car on 
the track for the start of Indianapolis 500 practice. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time Rahal was at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, it was one of the most 
embarrassing and frustrating moments of his life -- and he wanted to get on 
with his program and prove that 1993 was an aberration. 
</P>
<P>
 Rahal's last lap on the 2 1/2-mile oval, where he won the 500 in 1986, was run 
at 214.424 m.p.h., too slow to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 "After last year, everything is looking up," the balding, bespectacled Rahal 
said Saturday. "Last year, we came here with our own chassis, and when problems 
arose, we had no backup plan. This year, we're here with a new engine, but the 
comparisons aren't the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know people keep asking me, 'Well, what if you don't?' but even though the 
Ilmor and the Ford are the two best Indy car engines ever developed, we have no 
doubt the Honda will get us in the race." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, with the track open under sunny skies, Rahal made the most of his 
first outing with a lap at 219.791 m.p.h in his new Honda-powered Lola. It was 
10th fastest of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-owners Rahal and Carl Hogan, a St. Louis trucking magnate, packaged the 
unproven Honda Indy V-8 with a 1994 Lola chassis for Rahal and Mike Groff to 
drive. It is the first entry into Indy car racing by a Japanese manufacturer, 
but it comes with a California connection. 
</P>
<P>
 After the turbocharged engine was designed and manufactured by Honda in Japan, 
the task of preparing it for Indy car racing was assigned to the Honda 
Performance Development operations center in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 Honda, which built an engine that dominated Formula One in the '80s, is intent 
on attaining similar stature in American racing. Before the Rahal-Hogan team 
debuted the engine in Australia last March, it had been tested for nearly a 
year by Groff. 
</P>
<P>
 "The engines are changed every time the car runs, race to race or test session 
to test session," said Tom Elliott, HPD president. "Last year was our test 
year. This is a development year, so we constantly want to be trying new 
pieces. Obviously, our intent is to develop the pieces and run them during 
testing, and then run those pieces during the next race in a continuing 
development of the motor." 
</P>
<P>
 Honda's Formula One success, which cost upward of $50 million, has no bearing 
on its Indy car effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two programs are totally different," Rahal said. "For one, we use 
different fuels, but more important, we have strict technical restraints in 
building an Indy car engine, while in Formula One there are basically no 
regulations. It is much more difficult to create a competitive Indy car engine 
because the rules are so confining." 
</P>
<P>
 Groff, Rahal's test driver before being promoted to teammate, has tested the 
engine three times at Indianapolis, the most recent coming right after the 
Australia race. 
</P>
<P>
 "The test was not just for the engine, it was for the total package," said 
Groff, who moved with his wife from Van Nuys to Columbus, Ohio, to be near team 
headquarters. "Getting the proper balance between the engine and the chassis 
has been a trial-and-error thing, but after Long Beach our tests at Portland 
and Mid-Ohio were very encouraging." 
</P>
<P>
 Groff lapped Indy at 224 m.p.h. during the latest test, faster than Arie 
Luyendyk's pole speed of 223.967 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Test speeds don't mean a thing when it comes to qualifying, but it does give 
us a feeling of confidence going in," Rahal said. "We just hope, by race day, 
that we have a real good race car." 
</P>
<P>
 In three races this season, Australia, Phoenix and Long Beach, Rahal has 
struggled. At Australia, he was hit from behind on the first lap and knocked 
into another car, breaking the front suspension. At Phoenix, he made six pit 
stops with an ill-handling car before he finished 14th. At Long Beach, he 
qualified 11th, but after two laps retired with a broken gearbox oil line. 
</P>
<P>
 "The season certainly hasn't started the way we would have liked," Rahal said. 
"But we are moving in the right direction, and our recent testing has given me 
an optimistic outlook here." 
</P>
<P>
 Groff has done slightly better. He finished eighth in Australia, sixth at 
Phoenix and 27th at Long Beach after being sidelined early by Paul Tracy's 
spinning car. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the engine program began only last year, the idea has been around 
since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not long after I won Indy, I was at a dinner in Marysville, Ohio, where they 
build Hondas," Rahal said. "I gave a speech to some key people visiting from 
Japan and mentioned that I hoped Honda would come to Indy cars some day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept in contact with them, more or less, until 1989 when Mr. (Michihiro) 
Asaka -- he has been the project leader -- came to the Long Beach race and we 
set up a channel of communication about Indy cars. There was no confirmation 
that Indy cars were in their plans, but from time to time Mr. Asaka would show 
up at races. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were still in Formula One at the time, and it was clear they weren't 
going to do both at the same time. Finally, in January last year, they made the 
announcement and Carl (Hogan) and I were fortunate they chose us to carry their 
nameplate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I speak not only as a driver and as a team owner, but as a Honda dealer. It's 
good for business, because I think it's going to create a lot of excitement 
with Honda customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost any kind of excitement would be better than that associated with last 
year's stunning failure to make the 500. In 181 races, dating to his rookie 
year in 1982, Rahal had never failed to qualify. As a three-time PPG Cup Indy 
car champion (1986, 1987 and 1992), the disappointment was magnified. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not qualifying was one of the toughest moments of my racing career, but 
watching the race was harder on me," he said. "It was very emotional for my 
wife and me. . . . When the race started, Debi began to cry and I'll admit, I 
felt like it, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two things happened that day, though, that helped lift my spirits and make me 
even more determined to come back strong. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the race, I was down on the grid, visiting the drivers, and when I was 
walking off, a group of fans stood and gave me an ovation as I went by. That 
felt good. And when I saw the guys suited up, sitting in their cars waiting for 
the start, it was clear to me that I should be in the race. Any doubts or 
thoughts I might have had about retiring, or slowing down, were swept away." 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, his sponsor extended the Rahal-Hogan contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people do that, if that doesn't tell you that they support you and they 
believe in you, I don't know what would," Rahal said. "It's easy to be gracious 
when you're winning all the time, but I'd like to think the real mark of 
somebody is to be gracious when you're not."

MIKE DOWNEY: ANGUISH STRUCK OUT BY ANGEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fastened to the left side of the baseball player's locker is a color 
photograph of an adorable baby boy. Alongside it is a hook, from which dangles 
a pair of white gym-shoe booties, size 1. Directly opposite the locker, facing 
him, is a notice board on which the night's starting lineups have been 
scribbled in felt pen, with his own name at the bottom as starting pitcher. 
Across the top someone has written a reminder: "May 8 -- Happy Mother's Day." 
</P>
<P>
 The baby in the photo died in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Midnight is approaching on Mother's Day eve. Exhausted from a hard night's 
work, distressed by his own poor performance, a resolute Mark Leiter moves on 
to the next day, same as he has now for many weeks, same as his wife, Allison, 
has. They will take tomorrow as it comes. A man asks, "Any special plans for 
Mother's Day?" No, not really, the 31-year-old Angel pitcher responds with a 
guilty expression, as though it was his fault, because come Sunday the team 
must leave town. 
</P>
<P>
 "How about breakfast in bed?" the man suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 An amused smile, his first since the game ended, creases the pitcher's face. 
He says, "Nah, Mark would just jump into bed and make a mess of the whole 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Jr., he means. He is only 3. He, too, is a beautiful boy, and there is 
another photo, one of him beside his baby brother, above the bench of his dad's 
Anaheim Stadium locker, never far from mind or heart. His family is the 
pitcher's inspiration. It gets him through disappointments such as Saturday's, 
when he is roughed up by the last-place Oakland Athletics for seven runs. Every 
bad day like this is a danger to his career. But it's OK, because he has known 
far worse days. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the clubhouse, possibly no one is as popular, has such support. 
Teammates speak of it openly, of their admiration for Leiter, of their hope 
that he is in the Angel pitching rotation for good. Their manager, Buck 
Rodgers, shakes his head near the batting cage before a game and says, "We only 
really got the kid because we needed an extra pitcher and he had a live arm. 
For the last month, though, I don't know what we'd have done without him." 
</P>
<P>
 And that very first Angel game of his, well, that bordered on the 
unbelievable. On the inconceivable. 
</P>
<P>
 They say Lou Gehrig demonstrated courage beyond belief after learning he was 
dying from an illness that eventually would bear his name. They still tell of 
how Gehrig called himself the "luckiest man on the face of the Earth." But 
courage every bit as great was shown April 9 of this year, the courage of a 
young father, four days shy of his 31st birthday, who only hours earlier had 
personally overseen the cremation of his youngest son, a glorious child who 
never even got to have his first birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Leiter got on a plane, went right out and pitched a game. Pitched his 
heart out. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he and his wife acted quickly to establish the Ryan Leiter Fund, designed 
to aid families similarly affected by the disease, spinal muscular atrophy, 
that had claimed their boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after a game such as Saturday's, a defeat that weighs on him so heavily, 
a request for the fund's mailing address takes precedence. Leiter runs a finger 
across a shelf, knows he has the address here somewhere, is indebted to anyone 
who cares to contribute. Because, he says, "Every nickel we raise, it's another 
reminder that Ryan was here." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Leiter Fund, care of Families of S.M.A., Box 1465, Highland Park, IL 
60035, for those in a position to help. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Leiter is a sensitive man. Not so much on the field, where few pitchers 
are as intense, as in a zone. It is one of his strengths. It is what increased 
his worth to the Angels, particularly after injuries suffered by two other 
starting pitchers, Mark Langston and Brian Anderson, and an 
uncharacteristically poor opening month for another, Chuck Finley. Off the 
field, though, Leiter's intensity lessens. He worries. He scolds himself for 
not keeping pitches farther away from Oakland hitters, for grooving fastballs. 
Told that Rodgers emphasized the pitcher's having neglected to use all the 
stuff in his repertoire, for being a two-pitch pitcher, Leiter looks up with 
anxious eyes. He says, "Buck said that?" 
</P>
<P>
 More than two weeks have passed since Leiter's last victory. He is eager to 
please. No way the Angels had anticipated needing Anderson or Leiter so much. 
Leiter doesn't want to let them down. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the guys made the comment that, hey, one of us was in triple A, 
meaning Brian, and the other was a released, unemployed player, meaning me. And 
it's the truth," Leiter says. "But I can't think that way now. I'm here and I 
want to stay here. I want this team to need me, to be able to count on me." 
</P>
<P>
 He has gotten on with his life, with his livelihood. Born in Joliet, Ill., he 
also seemed born to be a pitcher, much like his brother Al, who has pitched for 
the Toronto Blue Jays, and his brother Kurt, who pitched for the Baltimore 
Oriole organization a decade ago. But overcoming defeat is such a part of a 
pitcher's life. Mark Leiter has had four arm operations. He has been released 
by Baltimore, traded by the New York Yankees, dumped by Detroit. Two weeks 
before the 1994 season opener, he had no job and a terminally ill child. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan was so sick. Born the previous summer, he was the new light of Leiter's 
life. Everything had been going so well. For the Tigers, he had won six 
consecutive games, from late April on. He even five-hit the Chicago White Sox 
with a complete game on June 3, maybe his best effort since breaking into the 
big leagues. Ryan was born and life was fine. Even an injured shoulder that 
prematurely ended his season couldn't undo what Mark Leiter had waiting for him 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the child was diagnosed with SMA, also called Werdnig-Hoffmann disease. 
It is a child's form of ALS, or, more commonly, Lou Gehrig's disease. It is 
invariably fatal. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 16, deep into spring training, the pitching-poor Tigers dropped a 
right-hander with a 92-m.p.h. fastball from their roster. Not everyone was sure 
why. Some said it was because a deadline was imminent at which time Detroit 
would owe him more money, but this seemed odd, in that Leiter didn't make all 
that much. And the team already had a staff of multimillionaires. In his heart 
of hearts, Leiter suspects they had doubts about his capacity to cope with his 
child's situation. He hopes that isn't true. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers says, "We asked our people if there was anything wrong with this kid 
that we should know about, because from the way he could throw a baseball, it 
didn't make sense to us that he was so, you know, available." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels signed him on March 22. Leiter and his family took a motel room at 
the Jolly Roger, up the road from the stadium. It was temporary, a place for 
his wife and kids to camp until he made the team. 
</P>
<P>
 He accompanied his new teammates to Minnesota for opening day. Back in 
Anaheim, his wife went shopping. The kids came along. Allison ducked into a 
store for only a few minutes. Her oldest boy, Mark, came in and told his mother 
she had better hurry back outside. When she got there, Ryan was still. He had 
died. Angel officials put their player on a plane, met him at his destination, 
took him to view his son for the last time. 
</P>
<P>
 You do what you have to do. In his mind, Mark Leiter felt he needed to get 
back on a plane, fly to Milwaukee, pitch a game of baseball that he was 
supposed to pitch. He worked six innings. He struck out six. He gave up two 
runs. He stood upon a mound, and strode from it, with a sense of purpose like 
few had ever seen. As Rodgers remembers it, "It gave you chills, what that kid 
did that day." 
</P>
<P>
 It is behind him now. He can't think back. 
</P>
<P>
 Foremost on the pitcher's mind now is why his fastball let him down, why he 
can't put it where it belongs. A man mentions that its speed was fine, still 
right up there in the low 90s. But Leiter is inconsolable. He says, "Doesn't 
matter how fast it is, it isn't worth a damn if you can't put it in the right 
spot." 
</P>
<P>
 Rising from a chair, he flexes his right arm, examines it as though it has 
betrayed him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll get it back," he says. "I have to."

BULLETS SHOOT BLANKS, WOMEN ROUTED IN DEBUT AGAINST MEN'S PRO TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Colorado Silver Bullets, the first all-woman baseball team to play against 
a professional men's team, had an inauspicious debut Sunday when they were 
routed 19-0 by the Northern League All-Stars. 
</P>
<P>
 The Silver Bullets had only two hits, singles by Michele McAnany and Stacy 
Sunny, against six All-Stars pitchers and committed six errors, four by 
shortstop Shae Sloan.The All-Stars had 21 hits, including three home runs -- 
two by former major leaguer Leon Durham -- and eight doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed, but not with the loss," Silver Bullets Manager Phil Niekro 
said. "I am disappointed with the way we didn't catch the ball or throw the 
ball like we can today." 
</P>
<P>
 Durham was joined by Dennis "Oil Can" Boyd, a former Boston Red Sox pitcher 
who started for the All-Stars, and several players with minor league 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 They scored eight runs in the first two innings, batted around in two innings 
and had 21 hits against four Colorado pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Silver Bullets will play a 50-game schedule as an affiliate of the 
Northern League, which is based in Burnsville, Minn. They next face the Red 
Mountain Bandits, a semipro team, in Tempe, Ariz., on May 13.

INDIANAPOLIS 500 / DAILY REPORT; FITTIPALDI SAYS COCKPIT COVER WOULD HELP 
DRIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Still saddened after the funeral of his close friend Ayrton Senna last 
Thursday in Brazil, Emerson Fittipaldi called Sunday for canopies to be added 
to cockpits of open-wheel Formula One and Indy cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Canopies, like ones used in off-shore racing boats, should be the next safety 
step for these cars," he said after practice opened for the May 29 Indianapolis 
500. "They could be the solution for head injuries, such as Ayrton's." 
</P>
<P>
 Fittipaldi, a two-time Formula One champion before switching to Indy cars, 
also criticized Formula One for its attitude toward safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the accident at Imola, the constructors blamed the promoters, the 
drivers blamed the constructors, everyone blamed someone else," he said. "They 
should all work with one another, not point fingers at others, but that is not 
their way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once, when I was racing (Formula One) and there was an accident where a 
driver was killed, I went out the next day to the place where the accident 
occurred and sought some answers for myself. Instead of asking me for some 
input, the FIA threatened me with suspension for looking around." 
</P>
<P>
 As to Senna's crash, Fittipaldi said: "The corner where he went off is one 
that everyone takes flat out. There must have been mechanical failure. 
(Michael) Schumacher was right behind him, and he said Senna's car seemed to 
bottom out and get a little out of shape before he went off the course. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why, we don't know yet, but it would have helped if there had been a tire 
barrier in front of the cement barrier where his car hit. For sure, at such a 
high-speed corner there should have been more protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would also recommend that F1 cars increase their minimum weight. They are 
much too fragile. They are 250 pounds lighter than Indy cars, and around the 
driver there is not a lot of material to absorb an impact. Indy cars are much 
better protected. Because F1 cars are so fragile, it makes drivers much more 
vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Brayton, driving a Menard V6 modification of the old Buick stock block 
engines built in his father's shop in Coldwater, Mich., stunned the more highly 
publicized drivers with a lap of 227.658 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Brayton reportedly had a trap speed of 243 m.p.h. on the straightaway, 
although he said, "I saw the speedometer and never went over 235." SHAV GLICK

KENTUCKY DERBY; GO FOR GIN'S VICTORY WASN'T MERELY A SLOPPY FLUKE, TRAINER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Winning the Kentucky Derby with Go For Gin on Saturday made Mother's Day even 
more special for trainer Nick Zito. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother watched the race on television in New York," Zito said at his 
Churchill Downs barn early Sunday. "She's 83. I talked to her on the phone 
after the race, and I could tell from her voice that she was more excited than 
last time." 
</P>
<P>
 Zito, 46, won the Derby with Strike The Gold in 1991 and is the 15th trainer 
with multiple winners. Ben Jones, training for once-dominant Calumet Farm, 
holds the Derby record with six victories from 1938 through 1952. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every three years," Zito said. "That's a good spacing. If I could keep that 
up, I might break the record." 
</P>
<P>
 Next for Go For Gin is the Preakness, the middle race in the Triple Crown, at 
Pimlico on May 21. At least five Derby horses besides Zito's colt are probables 
for the Preakness, two are possible and there might be four starters who didn't 
run in the Derby. Among them is Kandaly, who was scratched a couple of hours 
before the race because of the sloppy track. Twelve horses is a conservative 
estimate for the Baltimore race and 14 is the limit, with total career earnings 
determining the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Can Go For Gin repeat? 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that he likes Churchill Downs," Zito said Sunday. "I wish 
I could take this place, put it in a bottle and take it over there. But he 
never runs a bad race, no matter what the track. And as long as we don't draw 
post 13, and Holy Bull gets the four, I think he'll run a good race at Pimlico, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't take anything away from him because of the slop. He came here, trained 
super and earned it. He's the Kentucky Derby champion, and he's legitimate." 
</P>
<P>
 And he is lucky, surviving one of the worst starts in Derby history. Holy Bull 
was one of seven horses that had trouble, and the congestion on the clubhouse 
turn hindered four horses. Even Go For Gin ducked out at the start, knocking 
Tabasco Cat into Brocco. 
</P>
<P>
 While Zito reviewed the race at his barn Sunday, a figure approached from far 
down the shedrow, wearing a brown touring cap and a blue, hip-length rain 
slicker. It was Charlie Whittingham, the 81-year-old Hall of Fame trainer who 
failed to get his third Derby victory when Strodes Creek finished second, two 
lengths behind Go For Gin. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can win all the derbies in the world, but this is the honor," Zito said 
as Whittingham got closer. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittingham reached Zito and shook his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're a fine Italian boy," Whittingham said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took a page out of your book," Zito said. "You've always said that you 
should bring a horse to the Derby only when you have a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Whittingham will try to block Go For Gin's Triple Crown bid with Numerous, who 
won the Derby Trial and then skipped the Derby. Strodes Creek, bred for 
distance, will run in the final Triple Crown race, the Belmont Stakes on June 
11. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittingham said the $1-million Triple Crown bonus, which was discontinued 
this year, might have kept Strodes Creek in the Preakness. The bonus, offered 
from 1987 through 1993 to the horse who earned the most points in all three 
races, was won by Whittingham's Sunday Silence, the Derby-Preakness winner, in 
1989. The $5-million guarantee remains for a Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Strike The Gold ran sixth in the Preakness, then lost by a head to 
Hansel in the Belmont after a gritty stretch duel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Strike The Gold didn't like to run on the inside," Zito said. "But that's 
where he was, and that took us out of our game plan." 
</P>
<P>
 At 1 3/16 miles, the Preakness is the shortest of the Triple Crown races. The 
Derby is 1 1/4 miles and the Belmont 1 1/2 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Preakness is the hardest of the three to win," Zito said. "You 
don't know if your horse is going to like the track, and the chances are good 
that he's never run on it before. The turns at Pimlico are sharp. And there's 
only two weeks between that race and the Derby." Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Preakness probables from the Kentucky Derby include Go For Gin, Blumin 
Affair, Brocco, Tabasco Cat, Powis Castle and Holy Bull. The probables are Soul 
Of The Matter and Valiant Nature. Other possibilities include Numerous, Kandaly 
and Concern and Silver Goblin, who ran first and third, respectively, in the 
Arkansas Derby. . . . Chris McCarron rode Numerous to victory in the Derby 
Trial, but he will remain Go For Gin's rider. Eddie Delahoussaye might ride 
Numerous in the Preakness; he rode Strodes Creek in the Derby.

ANGELS ARE BACKING UP PEREZ PROJECT WITH EDMONDS, NOT SNOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels' grand plan to make sure Eduardo Perez gets the 500 at-bats, which 
will allow him to become the impact player they are certain he will become, 
changed the look of the team this spring. Concerned that Perez's tender elbow 
would not hold up to the rigors of playing left field, the Angels moved him to 
first base. 
</P>
<P>
 Bo Jackson and Dwight Smith ended up sharing duties in left field. And J.T. 
Snow ended up in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 The Perez project has been in a holding pattern for four days, however, 
because of a combination of strained ligaments in Perez's left hand and a 
batting average that has been above .221 only three days all season. 
</P>
<P>
 Did the Angels rush to recall Snow? 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, they never even considered it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim Edmonds has done an awfully good job of filling in," Manager Buck Rodgers 
said. "We haven't missed a lick with him in there." 
</P>
<P>
 After Sunday's 7-0 victory over Oakland, the Angels are 5-2 in the seven games 
Edmonds has started this season, providing increased impetus for the Edmonds 
project -- his own personal plan to get him as many at-bats as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "The change of scenery puts a little fire into you," Edmonds said. "You really 
get into the action at first and it's so fun to feel like you're contributing. 
I'm just going out there trying to prove I'm capable of playing this game and 
I'll take any opportunity, anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonds, who hit .246 in 18 games with the Angels in the final month of 1993 
after hitting .315 in Vancouver, didn't get much practice playing first during 
spring training because the Angels were concentrating on getting Perez 
prepared. Edmonds hadn't played first base since his first year in professional 
baseball in 1988, but when he started there on April 14 against Toronto, it 
wasn't long before the Angels knew the kid was all right. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew he (Edmonds) could play," Manager Buck Rodgers said. "He's probably 
the second-best outfielder on the club, but the way he can pick it at first has 
been a pleasant surprise. I knew we were in good shape in that first game when 
he made that play to get the lead runner." 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonds made a nice backhand stab of a shot by John Olerud and then spun 
around and fired a strike to second to force Joe Carter. And he's already 
earned a couple of cameos in the 1994 Angel highlight film with sprawling 
catches of balls destined for right field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm having a lot of fun," Edmonds said. "I've taken a lot of extra ground 
balls down there and I feel I can field the position. It's weird. I thought I'd 
have to earn my playing time with my bat, I never figured I'd be getting any 
because of my defense at first base." 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonds was hitting .444 before an errant throw by Yankee shortstop Mike 
Gallego hit him in the neck April 26. He missed five games because of dizziness 
and lost some of his confidence and rhythm at the plate. Still, in the past 
four games, Edmonds has five hits in 17 at-bats. He's struck out six times, but 
he has also driven in four runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was rusty for awhile, but I felt pretty good the last couple of days," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Perez, who is expected to return to the lineup Tuesday, has been Edmonds' 
most vocal supporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been cheering for him and he's been looking pretty darn good," Perez 
said. "It's great to see a friend, a guy who's been through the minors with 
you, doing good. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The injury) has been frustrating for me, but part of the reason I've been 
holding up so well is because Jim is doing such a great job. I'd feel a lot 
worse if he wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonds knows he will soon be relegated to back-up outfield status, but he's 
open to any suggestions. He is ambidextrous, after all, and could probably 
borrow a glove for his left hand. 
</P>
<P>
 So, if any of the other infielders need a little rest . . .

SUNNY HILLS GOLF TEAM IS STILL AS STRONG AS EVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the beginning of the golf season, Sunny Hills Coach Tim Devaney was in the 
dark. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no idea what kind of team this was going to be," Devaney said. "I 
usually never do." 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, Devaney has one of the stronger teams in Orange County. However, only 
one starter was to return from the 1993 team. He had heard the buzz -- that the 
Lancers were due to land some fine young players -- but Devaney isn't one to 
believe hearsay. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing is believing. With three freshmen, a sophomore, a junior and a senior, 
Sunny Hills is proving to be one of the best teams around. Today, the Lancers 
will try to advance to the Southern Section team championship by finishing 
among the top three positions at the Northern Regional tournament in Santa 
Maria. 
</P>
<P>
 Their chances appear to be promising, and Devaney seems to be convinced. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of my most consistent teams as far as playing right around par," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When you consider the Lancers individually, it should be no surprise the team 
is so strong. Three are very good high school golfers: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Senior Brad Knyal, who also plays quarterback for Devaney's football team, 
averages 41. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Freshmen Mike Kim and John Park, who average 40 and 39. 
</P>
<P>
 Three are among the best junior players in Southern California: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Junior Jenny Lee, who averages 39. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sophomore Terry Noe, the holdover from last season, and freshman Jin Park, 
who each average 37. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, Noe and Jin Park also have something else in common. They were each born 
in Seoul, South Korea, and have immigrated to the United States. Devaney said 
golf has helped each become accustomed to a new culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "In golf it obviously doesn't matter who you are or what language you speak," 
he said. "The game is the same, and they can fall back on it as they continue 
to become more fluent in English and adapt to this country." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, who has been in the United States four years, and Park, who has been here 
six, have mastered English more thoroughly than Noe, who has been here about 1 
1/2 years, but Noe is learning quickly, Devaney said. 
</P>
<P>
 And on the golf course there's little Noe can't do. He started playing the 
game about six years ago -- his father owns a factory that makes golf shoes in 
Korea, so it seemed like a natural sport for him, Noe said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's really very steady," Devaney said. "Even on a course that is new to him, 
most kids fuss with that, but not Terry. I've seldom seen him lose track of his 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 Noe, who advanced to the CIF-Southern California Golf Assn. individual 
tournament last year, recently has won four local junior tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just solid," said Bob Livingstone, who runs the Southern California PGA 
junior program. "He has no weaknesses." 
</P>
<P>
 Livingstone is also familiar with Jin Park's game. Last summer at age 13, Park 
was the overall point winner in the SCPGA's junior program. He has won three 
13-14 age-group titles at American Junior Golf Assn. tournaments, most recently 
last month at The Woodlands in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Livingstone said Park is one of the most dedicated players around. Livingstone 
said he tried for weeks to reach Park by telephone, so he could return a pair 
of shoes Park had left behind on a trip to a tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could never get a hold of him because he was always at the golf course," 
Livingstone said. 
</P>
<P>
 That commitment to his game has served him well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect him to score from anywhere on the course," Devaney said. "He may not 
hit the longest ball, but he's consistent." 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, Lee hits the ball a long way. She shyly admits to 240 
yards-plus. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's very long," Livingstone said. "Some people say she hits it farther than 
any girl that we've ever had in the local junior program, including Kellee 
Booth and Brandie Burton." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Lee, like all girls playing high school golf in California, is at a 
disadvantage playing against the boys on longer courses. But she has a deft 
touch around and on the green. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's got a hawkeye; she can ring the cup with her putter," Devaney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee moved to Fullerton from Hawaii with her family in November, partly so that 
trips to AJGA events wouldn't be so grueling. Last month she won her first AJGA 
event, the same tournament Park won, and she is currently the seventh-ranked 
girl in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jenny just kind of showed up on the doorstep," Devaney said. "The kids said 
there's a pretty good player in school who's a girl." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee proved to be better than pretty good, and so did the Lancers (15-1), who 
were ranked third in the midseason county coaches poll. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 4 Huntington Beach narrowly beat Sunny Hills, 385-387, at Los Coyotes 
Country Club Thursday, but the Lancers won't face any Orange County team in the 
regional. Because no other Freeway League school has a golf team, Sunny Hills 
plays a freelance schedule, which means the Lancers are in the Northern 
Regional today instead of the tough Southern Regional Tuesday at Green River 
Golf Course in Chino. 
</P>
<P>
 If, as expected, the Lancers advance from their regional, they will get a shot 
at the Southern Section's best, May 16 at Canyon Country Club in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything can happen," Jin Park said. "But we don't expect to win. We just 
want to go out and play our best and see the results afterward. But there are a 
lot of other good teams."

 Savings Bond Sales Fall: The Treasury sold $740 million in U.S. Savings Bonds 
in April, down 19.6% from $920 million a year earlier, it announced in 
Washington. Still, the April sales pushed the value of Savings Bonds held by 
Americans to $175.9 billion, up 6.7% from the $164.8 billion outstanding in 
April, 1993.Savings Bonds issued on or after March 1, 1993, and held five years 
or longer earn the market-based interest rate if it averages more than the 
guaranteed minimum of 4%. The rate from May 1 through Oct. 31 is 4.7%. Bonds 
issued before March, 1993, retain their existing guaranteed minimum rates until 
they enter a new extended maturity period. If redeemed within five years, bonds 
earn 4%.

GIANTS DOW, MONSANTO MAY SELL DRUG UNITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The recent flurry of restructurings in the drug industry has fueled 
speculation that two chemical giants -- Monsanto Co. and Dow Chemical Co. -- 
may seek to shed their drug units. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said Roche Holding Ltd.'s $5.3-billion acquisition last week of 
Syntex Corp. may have restored luster to drug firms' values, which have been 
tarnished by fears that health care reform could put a cap on their earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 And Eastman Kodak Co.'s decision last Tuesday to sell its Sterling Winthrop 
Inc. drug subsidiary may make other parent companies think about divesting drug 
units. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chemical companies are on a big drive to strategic focus, and obviously 
removing the pharmaceutical operations from both Monsanto and Dow fits right 
into that big picture strategy," said Paul Raman, analyst at S.G. Warburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Now may be the time to divest while drug stocks are up, analysts say. Although 
prices rose on the Syntex sale, drug stocks are still below the highs attained 
in recent years and may fall again if health care reform includes controls on 
drug prices. 
</P>
<P>
 David Saks, pharmaceutical analyst for Gruntal & Co., said that "the (drug) 
industry is in a very entrepreneurial environment, and mega-deals will continue 
to occur." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say that under proposed reforms to the nation's health care system, 
caps on drug prices could hamper business prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 Selling drug subsidiaries could lessen corporations' exposure to the vagaries 
of pricing and politics, keeping safe their other businesses, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Syntex deal indicated that foreign companies may be willing to overlook 
U.S. health care reform and pay well for solid drug companies, Saks said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a revaluation of the industry dynamics that leads to a revaluation 
of the industry stocks," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Raman said that both Monsanto's G.D. Searle & Co. drug subsidiary and Dow 
Chemical's 72%-owned Marion Merrell Dow Inc. have similar characteristics to 
Syntex. 
</P>
<P>
 All three companies are second-tier firms with little global exposure and thin 
short-term but attractive long-term pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Syntex's value, Searle is worth about $25 per Monsanto share, about 
its previously estimated worth, Raman said. Marion Merrell Dow also is worth 
about $25 a share, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monsanto has made no secret that it its seeking to wring more value out of 
Searle, acquired in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Company Chairman Richard Mahoney said in Monsanto's annual report that Searle 
was a sustainable operation, but fell short of Monsanto's original intentions 
when it bought the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Monsanto was seeking to form alliances with pharmaceutical companies that 
would raise Searle's presence and reduce its costs, he said. "An intense effort 
is under way to find the right partners."

 Pump Prices Head Upward: Gasoline prices rose more than half a penny a gallon 
on average during the past two weeks, the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 service 
stations showed. The nationwide average price of gasoline on May 6, including 
all grades, services and taxes, was $1.1357 a gallon, up 0.61 of a cent over 
the April 22 poll, said survey publisher Trilby Lundberg. She blamed the slight 
rise on stronger crude oil prices and refinery implementation of costlier 
spring and summer clean air fuel recipes.

 IBM to Sell New York Tower: IBM has tentatively agreed to sell its 43-story 
Manhattan headquarters for $205 million, Crain's New York Business said. The 
report said that the price, about $200 a square foot, would be the most paid 
for office space since New York City's real estate market collapsed in the late 
1980s.The computer giant earlier announced a restructuring that concentrates on 
industries rather than geography. Currently, International Business Machines 
Corp.'s massive sales force, estimated at 30,000 worldwide, is divided into 
geographical regions and product lines. Analysts largely cheered the move, 
saying the Armonk, N.Y.-based company has been evolving to focus more on 
customer needs in specific industries. The marketing teams will be focused on 
14 industries, such as communications, distribution, education, finance, 
government and health.

 R.H. Macy & Co., already the target of a merger proposal from competitor 
Federated Department Stores, has caught the eye of Nomura Securities 
International Inc., which may want to finance the retailer's reorganization, 
people familiar with Macy's bankruptcy case said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nomura, the U.S. investment banking unit of Japan's Nomura Securities, has 
informed Macy's of its efforts to form a proposal for the New York-based 
retailer and has held talks with Macy's bondholders, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy's filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Cyrus Vance, the court-appointed mediator in Macy's case, is also aware that 
Nomura is working to play a role in the company's reorganization. But some of 
Macy's secured creditors said they have yet to be approached by the investment 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know nothing about it," the senior creditor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nomura, a major player in the mortgage business, wants to assist in the 
financing of Macy's reorganization but is not looking to own the company after 
it emerges from bankruptcy, one bankruptcy source said. 
</P>
<P>
 It would base its deal on its ability to raise funds and would not rely as 
heavily on the use of equity as does a separate proposal by Macy's and 
Federated Department Stores, which seeks to merge with Macy's. 
</P>
<P>
 Nomura's offer would probably involve the refinancing of Macy's real estate, 
one source said. The real estate would then be used as collateral for new 
bonds, the sale of which would go toward paying off creditors, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 P.J. Johnson, Nomura's spokesman, declined to comment. Macy's spokeswoman 
Laura Melillo also had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Macy's creditors said Nomura's bid is flawed because it calls for 
strapping an already highly leveraged company with even more debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy's does expect to make a profit during its first year out of bankruptcy, 
which makes it an even less attractive candidate for such a leveraged deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, many involved in the Macy's case have long expected the retailer 
would attract new bidders. Little Rock, Ark.-based Dillard Department Stores 
had also expressed interest in some of Macy's assets. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Times reported Saturday that Nomura has not made a concrete offer 
for Macy's, but it has discussed a rough figure of as much as $3.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy's own reorganization proposal calls for creditors to receive $3.67 
billion plus a potential extra $260 million for unsecured creditors, depending 
on the value of Macy's stock over time. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati-based Federated, which has acquired a large share of Macy's debt, 
has proposed merging the two retailers, with a payout of $3.51 billion to 
creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 Vance has asked Macy's, Federated and a third group made up of Macy's 
bondholders to submit revisions to their proposals for the company today. 
</P>
<P>
 Under ground rules set by Vance, Macy's bidders have received his approval 
before distributing proposals to creditors.

VISIONS OF A BILLION SALES DANCE IN THEIR HEADS; TRADE: FOREIGN PRODUCTS ARE 
DOING WELL IN CHINA. BUSINESS PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO MORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Talk of selling to China and that magic number soon comes up: 1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Just imagine one sale for every man, woman and child in China, goes the 
foreign business person's perennial refrain. 
</P>
<P>
 J. Michael Jardine of the Walt Disney Co. (Hong Kong) says it has already been 
done. Disney's Donald Bubble Gum, made under license in China by a U.S.-Chinese 
joint venture, sold more than a billion pieces last year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hazard a guess that they are the first foreign-brand product to sell 
a billion of anything in China," Jardine said. 
</P>
<P>
 True, we're talking about 1 1/4-inch pieces of bubble gum priced at less than 
a penny apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 But the achievement dramatizes how far foreign products have come in China 
since the 1980s, when soft drinks and cigarettes were virtually the only 
foreign-brand items in shops outside a few major cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Prospects of reaching at least the 300 million urban residents among China's 
1.2 billion people are better than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 That explains why U.S. business people are nervously awaiting President 
Clinton's scheduled announcement in June on whether he'll renew China's 
low-tariff trade status of "most favored nation" for another year. He has 
threatened to cancel it if China fails to improve its human rights record. 
</P>
<P>
 Cancellation would close many business opportunities to Americans, although 
U.S. companies that already manufacture in China hope to be somewhat insulated 
from any tariff war. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign investment in China totaled $25.7 billion last year and could top that 
this year. Much of the investment is directed at making consumer goods for sale 
inside China. 
</P>
<P>
 Imports are also climbing, but high tariffs keep imported consumer items 
beyond the reach of most Chinese -- except when the goods are smuggled in, 
another growth area. 
</P>
<P>
 It is now possible for a Chinese man or woman who has never gone abroad to 
start the day by shampooing with Head and Shoulders; dress in an Anne Klein or 
Ermenegildo Zegna suit; bicycle to work on a Schwinn 12-speed; sip instant 
Maxwell House coffee while working at a Compaq computer; lunch at Pizza Hut; 
head for a health club and don Reebok exercise clothes; then go home to watch 
videos on a Toshiba television while snacking on M&Ms or Planters Peanuts. 
</P>
<P>
 There are even foreign stores that sell exclusively or predominantly 
foreign-brand products. Japan's Yaohan chain has a department store in Beijing, 
and Seibu opened one last year in Shenzhen, adjoining Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chinese sports shoes don't look well, but the main thing is quality," said 
Han, a young man in jeans and T-shirt who was buying Nike sports shoes at the 
Beijing Yaohan. The price was $60, more than most Chinese earn in a month, but 
Han said, "I can wear these shoes three, four years." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney has licensed more than 60 children's boutiques in stores around China, 
with clothing and toys featuring "Mouse Mi" -- Mickey Mouse -- and "Old Duck 
Tang" -- Donald Duck. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will become the most important Asian market to us within 10 years," 
Jardine predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 The factors behind the foreign invasion are many. Western and Japanese 
companies facing sluggish economies at home are pushing harder at new markets 
and are applying lessons learned about China from less successful efforts in 
the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 China has also let down some barriers to foreign companies and products. 
Foreigners used to be barred from retailing; now, joint-venture stores are 
allowed in some cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning Chinese renminbi into hard currency used to be impossible; now it's 
merely difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Limits on advertising have been relaxed, allowing foreign companies to build 
name recognition. Jardine said the Donald bubble gum manufacturer plastered ads 
on Shanghai buses, which would not have been allowed in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Local authorities, competing to attract foreign capital, have become more 
flexible in interpreting regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Practice is moving ahead of regulation," said Anne Stevenson-Yang, Beijing 
representative of the U.S.-China Business Council. "You can do a lot more in 
the way of promoting, distributing and servicing your product than you could a 
few years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, three straight years of strong economic growth have given many 
city residents more disposable income. 
</P>
<P>
 If China gains entry this year to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, 
the world trade body, more barriers to foreign products and services could 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, you're definitely not looking at 1 billion" buyers, said Philip Shen, 
general manager of Kraft General Foods International's joint venture in Canton, 
which makes Maxwell House coffee. He said coffee is too expensive for most 
Chinese. "But whatever figure you end up with from a base like that, it's still 
going to be quite significant." 
</P>
<P>
 There's no significant competition from domestic coffee companies. Other 
products such as prepared baby foods, disposable razors and dandruff shampoos 
didn't exist in China before foreign companies introduced them. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese companies have been quick to imitate and challenge. Daniel Loeb, 
general manager of Nike International Ltd.'s China operation, said local makers 
of Nike look-alike sports shoes have the advantage of lower prices and fewer 
distribution hassles. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign companies have to go through local distributors, and many stores have 
limits on how many foreign brands they can stock. They also often have to pay 
more than Chinese companies for electricity, staff wages and services. Bank 
credit is hard to get. 
</P>
<P>
 This is where veteran foreign businessmen interrupt with tales of how they 
overcame far worse problems in the 1980s. One likes to tell how he bought tons 
of frozen shrimp for export in order to get dollars to import equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 If there aren't really 1 billion potential customers out there, is it worth 
it? "No question about it," said Loeb. "You have to play the game."

MASON, OF ALL PEOPLE, LEADS KNICKS OVER BULLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anthony Mason, barely noticeable in New York's first four playoff games, made 
the biggest plays of all Sunday when the Knicks completed an unlikely comeback 
against the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
 Mason converted a fastbreak layup with 48 seconds left to give the Knicks 
their first lead since the first quarter, then grabbed a key rebound that 
forced the Bulls to foul in the final seconds of New York's 90-86 victory in 
the series opener. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't down because there was a whole quarter and a few minutes to go," 
Mason said of the rally from a 15-point second-half deficit. "That's an 
eternity for us." 
</P>
<P>
 With the score 86-86, Mason broke ahead of the field, took a long pass from 
John Starks and scored. Then B.J. Armstrong missed for the Bulls, and when Greg 
Anthony's long shot with the shot clock running down grazed the rim, Mason 
grabbed the rebound, forcing Chicago to foul Starks for the clinching free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago Coach Phil Jackson said the Bulls were denied a chance to get the ball 
back because of an official's whistle while the ball was in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our players stopped playing, they got the ball and we had to foul," Jackson 
said. "Because it was an inadvertent whistle, I think it should have been a 
jump ball to rectify the error." 
</P>
<P>
 Mason, who scored just six points in four games against New Jersey but had 11 
Sunday, said he was the only player who didn't hesitate when the whistle blew. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way we weren't going to get the ball is if the refs thought the ball 
didn't hit the rim. They thought the play was over, but I kept going." 
</P>
<P>
 Of his breakaway layup that put New York ahead, Mason said: "I broke loose 
because they were trying to pressure the ball after the miss. John finally saw 
me and got the ball to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Knick Coach Pat Riley said, "I don't know how Mason got open. It was a real 
backbreaker for them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls, who eliminated the Knicks from the playoffs for three straight 
years en route to the NBA title, led 67-52 with 3:15 left in the third quarter, 
but New York outscored them 38-19 the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took us a long time to get with it," Riley said. "We were not into it 
physically or mentally in the first half. Then it came down to big heart and 
big effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Ewing had 18 points and 12 rebounds and Starks 17 points for the 
Knicks, who limited New Jersey to an average of 86.5 points in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Scottie Pippen scored 24 points and Armstrong 17 for Chicago, which lost three 
of four regular-season games to the Knicks in the first year since the 
retirement of Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Knicks realize that we're going to be a much tougher opponent 
than everyone anticipated," Pippen said. "But even if they win four games from 
us, they'll know they've been in a tough series." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls, who shot 51% in the first half, missed 19 of their first 28 shots 
in the second, hitting 32%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We allowed them to shut us down in the second half," Pippen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago, which averaged 74 points in losing its last three regular-season 
games to New York, extended a 10-point halftime lead to 59-44 early in the 
third quarter, then went nearly four minutes without scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Knicks failed to take advantage, managing just three points. New York 
finished the quarter with a 10-4 spurt, closing to 71-62 going into the final 
12 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Still trailing 76-66 with 10:29 to go, the Knicks scored the next eight 
points, closing within two, then tied it 79-79 on Mason's two free throws. New 
York then went 3:38 without a field goal, but when Charles Oakley converted a 
three-point play with 2:11 left, the score was 84-84.

SOCCER / JULIE CART; U.S. SHOULD WELCOME CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JULIE CART

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The best thing that has happened to the U.S. national team this year has been 
what has come to be known as "the goalkeeper controversy." This played out last 
week when the U.S. Soccer Federation selected Jurgen Sommer as its third World 
Cup goalkeeper, thus eliminating the highly regarded Kasey Keller from the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-guessing and analysis began immediately: Arguments about the 
relative strengths of each of the three 'keepers, the possible political 
motivations for the selections, the practical impact for the U.S. team against 
World Cup opponents. This and other decisions of U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic 
were again scrutinized and criticized. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer officials are skittish, as always, at any hint of disagreement in the 
happy family. Their attitude is wrongheaded. Hooray for soccer. This entire 
episode is the first sign anyone has seen that soccer is being taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Controversy. This is exactly what happens to "mainstream" sports when 
decisions are made. Fans praise or complain. Insiders look for hidden agendas. 
Debate is created. This is what sports in the United States are about. You want 
people talking about soccer.  
</P>
<P>
 The best thing that could happen to the sport is if radio sports talk show 
hosts stopped making fun of it and began to seriously analyze just such 
decisions. People talk about things they care about.  
</P>
<P>
 Here's another way to view it: Which is better, to select a World Cup team 
with an inevitable shrug of the shoulders because the talent pool is so 
shallow, or to generate intense competition among qualified candidates? A 
surplus of skilled goalkeepers isn't the problem; It's a lack of competition 
that should worry soccer officials. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been criticism. There will be more when roster cuts are made. At 
least someone cares, at least the public is paying attention. At least some 
fans are well-informed enough to have a discerning opinion. A little noise is 
surely better than deafening silence. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 As for Keller, give him high marks for class. It would be natural for him to 
feel snubbed since he got precious few scouting visits as he went through his 
second outstanding season for Millwall in the English First Division. 
</P>
<P>
 But when he did finally discuss the decision last Friday from his apartment in 
London, Keller was professional and resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was definitely something I had in the back of my mind," Keller said of the 
possibility that he would not be selected for the World Cup team. "It was 
something I was well prepared for. Even to the point of discussing doing some 
British (television) commentary during the World Cup. I just thought that what 
I had done (at Millwall) for the past year had to filter through somehow. It 
didn't, I guess. I'm disappointed, but I did all I could do and I have a good, 
stable professional career here that I have built." 
</P>
<P>
 Keller was eager to dispel a rumor that he was not selected because his ego 
would not allow him to sit quietly while someone else started. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want anybody to think it was an ego thing on my part," he said. "That 
I was too big to be part of the team and not play. I would have been happy to 
have come in and given the benefit of my experience, even if I didn't play." 
</P>
<P>
 Keller was Tony Meola's backup in the 1990 World Cup and, at age 24, he has 
other chances, provided the U.S. can qualify. If not, Keller has established an 
excellent reputation in England and now has a transfer fee value of 1 1/2 
million pounds.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a personal setback, but it won't hurt my career," Keller said. "My 
game is improving every day. That's what's important." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of deafening silence, what is happening with the proposed 
professional soccer league? Not much. 
</P>
<P>
 That sums up the investment interest in Major League Soccer, which has 
announced it will begin operations next spring. The league has been seeking an 
aggregate of $100 million in initial investment, $60 million in cash -- 
astonishing figures in the current economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Indications are of massive retrenchment by MLS. Investors were at first 
required to put up $10 million each, but now that figure has been halved. 
Additionally, sources say the league has gone to Wall Street to seek financing. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12 franchise cities are to be announced June 15 and it looks doubtful that 
each city will have met at least one major criterion for selection: The saleof 
10,000 season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Another potential financial blow was dealt a few weeks ago, when the USSF 
executive committee shot down an MLS proposal that the pro league assume 
marketing rights for the U.S. national team and the Olympic team. Someone 
noticed those rights were already held by Soccer USA Partners (SUSAP), which 
the USSF contracted to promote the teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the matter of players. If the 12 teams have rosters of 18, the 
new league will need 216 players. Allowing for four foreign players on each 
team, that still leaves room for some 168 American professional players. Where 
are they? 
</P>
<P>
 Take every player off the the World Cup roster, assuming the new league could 
pay the millions in transfer fees for the foreign-based players, and assuming 
the players would want to play in the MLS for less money, and that still leaves 
146 players needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the best of the rest of the American players are under contract to 
American Professional Soccer League (APSL) teams, and those teams could not be 
expected to happily turn over their players to their rival, the MLS. 
</P>
<P>
 So where is the MLS going to get its players?

REAL MOVERS AND SHAKERS; WHAM-O PAIR SPUN OFF FRISBEES AND HULA HOOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENEE TAWA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oh, how the place once shook and shimmied, wobbled and whirled, this twinkling 
toy factory that turned out Whing Dings and Nutty Knotters and Zip Zaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, two new USC grads, Rich Knerr and Arthur (Spud) Melin, dreamed up 
this whimsical place called Wham-O in 1948; two wacky best friends who once got 
arrested in Pasadena for hurling rotten oranges at each other as teens. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, they began a mail-order business by making 75-cent slingshots in the 
Knerr family garage, then moved on to ship a pirate's treasure chest worth of 
toys around the world -- Silly String, Slip 'N Slides, Frisbees and dozens more 
-- from the company's San Gabriel complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, they masterminded a ring of plastic called the Hula Hoop, the 
world's ultimate rock 'n' roll toy of the late '50s, a hip-wiggling invention 
that exploded onto the scene at a time when TV cameras shot Elvis only from the 
waist up. Oh, how Knerr and Melin miss the Hula Hoop's heyday, when the world 
came calling. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole world went crazy with Hula Hoop," recalled Knerr, now a 68-year-old 
Arcadia resident. 
</P>
<P>
 "They called us, 'The Fun House.' We acted kind of nutty on purpose," said 
Melin, a 69-year-old Irvine resident. 
</P>
<P>
 But their improbable story -- one of two local boys who made history -- is all 
but forgotten. Indeed, Wham-O's story is shoved aside in the recently released 
Hollywood movie, "The Hudsucker Proxy," a fictional account of the Hula Hoop's 
making, starring Tim Robbins and Paul Newman. The story is a dark one, about 
how a corporate board's scheme to ruin Hudsucker Industries is thwarted by the 
company's invention of the wildly popular Hula Hoop. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a bittersweet juncture for Wham-O -- just when Hollywood is making the 
Hula Hoop a shining star again, the company's spotlight continues to fade, 
almost to black. On May 31, Mattel Inc. takes over when it closes a deal to buy 
Kransco, Wham-O's parent company. Mattel, the country's largest toy maker, 
isn't saying what changes, if any, are in store for Wham-O. 
</P>
<P>
 Knerr and Melin, who retired 12 years ago and are still best friends, say 
little about Mattel, only that the pairing looks to be a good match. Publicly, 
Wham-O employees say they don't know what to expect from Mattel; privately, 
they worry that the new owner will shut down their offices and reassign 
operations to one of Mattel's Southern California plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Wham-O's San Gabriel complex -- which made and shipped 100 million 
Hula Hoops in the first 16 months of the toy's introduction -- mostly handles 
administrative duties for its parent company; no toys are made or invented 
there anymore. Now, the possibility looms that the original complex will 
disappear completely. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Wham-O has shrunk, like an image in a fun-house mirror. A 
skeleton crew of 20 -- down from more than 1,000 -- runs the once-bustling 
company. Now, Wham-O's 171,000-square-foot complex and its eight buildings are 
as quiet as a tired big top, with suite after suite of abandoned offices and 
warehouses so empty that you could fling a Frisbee from end to end without 
hitting a thing. 
</P>
<P>
 It's eerie all right, the stillness of a place that once buzzed with the whiz 
of shrink-wrap machines and the glee of Knerr and Melin at play, shooting each 
other with Air Blaster toy guns and plotting practical jokes, like the time 
when Knerr shipped a baby elephant to his partner's wife in San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very sad," Melin acknowledged. "(Wham-O) just went down to almost nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now when you go out there, there's zero, OK?" said plant manager Larry 
Frazier, a 26-year employee, sadly spreading his empty hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Wham-O's transformation began in 1982, when Knerr and Melin decided to retire 
and sell the company to Kransco for $12 million. Within five years, the San 
Francisco-based toy and sporting goods manufacturer had shifted most of 
Wham-O's production to Mexico, laid off all but a few of the 300 full-time 
staff members and stopped hiring the 300 to 500 temporary workers who came 
aboard during the busy season. 
</P>
<P>
 In the old days, Wham-O created and shipped 40 to 50 different products a 
year; now, the San Gabriel warehouse sends out only three Wham-O products -- 
the Hula Hoop, Frisbee and Hacky Sack -- that are made elsewhere and then 
shipped in for distribution. Wham-O stopped making toys in San Gabriel more 
than 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, more than three decades after the Hula Hoop craze, Wham-O's small office 
staff works on promotions, advertising and product development for Kransco, 
which makes Hula Hoops in Virginia Beach and Frisbees in Mexico. The staff 
still works out of Wham-O's aging original buildings, with stained carpet and 
worn linoleum. 
</P>
<P>
 But oh, what a place it was, started by two buddies who simply believed in a 
plastic tube in impossibly bright colors and ignored the scuttlebutt that said 
no, sir, you can't sell a rinky-dinky garden hose for three bucks. But the 
colorful hoops turned into an overnight sensation, creating such hysteria that 
the Japanese police banned the "Hura Hoopu" from Tokyo streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the Hula Hoop's heyday, workers cranked out 20,000 Hula Hoops a day in 
Johannesburg, Tokyo, Paris and five other plants; in San Gabriel, supervisors 
set up production lines in the warehouse, the parking lot, the hallways, 
wherever there was room. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a time of endless madness, a toy so famous that it is displayed in the 
Smithsonian Institution and listed in Webster's dictionaries. Following the 
credits for "The Hudsucker Proxy," a disclaimer says that the Hula Hoop 
actually was invented by Wham-O's founders, "a true American success story." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the real story, of how the world fell in love with Wham-O. 
</P>
<P>
 Wham-O's founders grew up as two playful boys, always scheming, little 
entrepreneurs to the bone. At age 9, Knerr made rubber-band guns out of old 
wooden apple crates and clothespins, hawking them to kids on his street in 
South Pasadena. Melin grew up in Pasadena; at age 10, during summer vacations 
in Newport Beach, he turned into a mega-fisherman -- he rigged up a clothesline 
over a part of Balboa Bay, attached 50 hooks with bait and collected the 
morning's catch by rowboat. Then he loaded his red wagon with ice and sold 
fresh halibut and bass, door to door. 
</P>
<P>
 The two hit it off when they met as teen-agers, kindred spirits. After 
college, neither wanted to work for his father -- Knerr's dad was in industrial 
real estate, Melin's in the lumber business. They decided to sell their 
homemade slingshots after their barber suggested that maybe there was a few 
bucks in it. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1948, the two buddies started a little sporting goods company, moving from 
the Knerr family garage to a rented space in Alhambra. They made the 
slingshots, hunting knives and crossbows with a band saw they bought from Sears 
for a $7 down payment. They came up with the company's name, based on the sound 
of a slingshot hitting its target -- Sling-O? Slam-O? How about Wham- O? Within 
a few years, their mail-order business was pulling in about $100,000 a year, 
enough for the partners to buy their first building in San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither partner fancied himself a toy maker. Until one day, they took an 
unlikely chance on a simple piece of plastic that skimmed the air like a flying 
saucer. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened on the beach one day, when a fellow and his flying disc caught 
their eye. The disc player, Fred Morrison, called his invention the "Pluto 
Platter" and agreed to sell it to Wham-O. Knerr and Melin renamed the disc 
after a funny cartoon character; afterward, the two marketing geniuses just 
winked when the curious asked if the Frisbee worked via invisible string. In 
1957, they put out their first toy, the Frisbee, and took their first turn down 
the road to fame. 
</P>
<P>
 The very next year, a friend told them that they ought to see the bamboo rings 
that Australian kids twirled in exercise class. Those hoops, they were 
something else. So, without seeing the Australian version, Knerr and Melin 
decided to fiddle with a hoop of their own that they made of ash wood and bound 
with rawhide. They asked a visiting Australian toy maker to show them how the 
hoop worked, but the guy only could only manage a whirl or two before it fell 
at his feet. 
</P>
<P>
 But one Saturday in the office, Wham-O's 22-year-old research and development 
engineer picked up the hoop and got it twirling around his waist like crazy. 
The engineer, Dick Gillespie, was on to something, and the partners knew it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone just fell off their chairs, they couldn't believe it," said 
Gillespie, 58, a San Gabriel resident. 
</P>
<P>
 The partners set out to find the right material for the hoop -- something that 
swung soft on the body. The wood wasn't right, so they decided to go with 
plastic, a substance that had relatively recently come into popular use and 
that was lighter and more flexible. Then the name -- Twirl-A-Hoop? 
Swing-A-Hoop? How about Hula Hoop? 
</P>
<P>
 The madness began. 
</P>
<P>
 Knerr and Melin tested the hoop on local school kids; one of the Hula Hoop's 
first trial runs was at a Pasadena elementary school in the summer of 1958. 
They told the kids: You master the hoop, and it's yours. Oh, how the faces of 
kids lit up when they got the hang of it. Soon, the kids improvised by twirling 
the hoop around their necks, then their feet, defying both gravity and social 
conventions at the same time. Even Gillespie's wife, who told him that the hoop 
action looked "nasty," got hooked and, three months later, climbed on a table 
in New York to demonstrate the toy in front of industry buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the toy industry, skeptics scoffed and then ate their words. Consider the 
bigwig New York City toy distributor who looked down his nose at 22-year-old 
Gillespie, a kid peddling a colored piece of plastic. No thanks, said the 
bigwig, eating his Danish pastry off a linen napkin. But a month-and-a-half 
later, the bigwig showed up at Wham-O's New Jersey plant, rolled up his suit 
sleeves and helped load trucks so that the Hula Hoop would get to his 
distributors on time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hula Hoop craze died down in the early '60s, almost as quickly as it had 
started, but by then, Wham-O was on a roll. The company had one tiger by the 
tail in the Hula Hoop and kept looking for others. In the '60s and '70s, Wham-O 
put out dozens of toys, whatever caught the partners' fancy. Half the fun was 
in the toy's name, which rolled off the tongue and packed a punch in the 
parlance of super-hero comic-book speak: Super Elastic Bubble Plastic. Shrink 
Machine. The Bubble Thing. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wham-O took the fun business seriously. Factory workers puffed out their 
chests when they saw the way the world took to the Hula Hoops and Frisbees that 
they made, said former assembly worker June Brisley. 
</P>
<P>
 Everywhere Brisley turned, she saw kids playing with Wham-O toys. One night, 
on a family vacation in Seattle, she marched over to talk to picnickers who 
were throwing glow-in-the-dark Frisbees that looked like flying moons. "I made 
this," she announced. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were so proud," said Brisley, a 66-year-old San Dimas resident who 
arranges Wham-O reunions twice a year. "We packed Hula Hoops, three dozen to a 
box, red, pink, yellow, packing, packing, packing . . . making a whole bunch of 
toys, making kids happy." 
</P>
<P>
 That was the kind of place that Knerr and Melin built; everyone called them 
"Rich and Spud." No fancy high-powered ad agencies or focus groups -- Wham-O 
tested toys on the kids of employees and filmed commercials in Knerr or Melin's 
back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The two partners hated to sit behind a desk. In the office, they put money on 
who could throw a Super Ball -- a Wham-O plastic ball with legendary bounce -- 
into a wastebasket in a certain number of bounces. They took breaks outside, 
shooting darts into the wood side of a liquor store or picking Frisbee targets. 
Someone picked a target -- a car door, for instance -- and then the other 
person picked a farther target until they ended up blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I miss it all the time," mourned Melin, who still throws his Frisbee over the 
ocean with reverse spin so that it arcs right back into the hands of its maker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if Spud and I had to say what we contributed, it was fun," said 
Knerr, whose wife still can't get him out of a toy store. "But I think this 
country gave us more than we gave it. It gave us the opportunity to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 And they did it with style, in a place where employees felt loose enough to 
sneak up on the two partners one day and douse them with Silly String. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really humming, I'm telling you," said Carmelita Mata, 79, a former 
assembly line worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, even a solitary hum would echo through the empty Wham-O warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier, the plant manager, knows every square inch of the buildings, where 
managers used to watch for bad batches of glue, where sealing machines 
hot-stamped Frisbees with Wham-O's candy-cane red-and-white logo, where an 
outside railroad spur allowed trains to whisk away products directly from 
assembly lines. 
</P>
<P>
 One afternoon, Frazier headed for the company's makeshift archive, a 
cinder-block tomb of sorts for forgotten toys, ghosts of Wham-O's past. The 
archive is actually the old warehouse tool crib, down a cement walkway, shut 
off by a chain-link fence. 
</P>
<P>
 From a rusty tool shelf, Frazier picked up a box of the Super Balloon -- an 
inflatable 10-foot-long skinny balloon -- and unfolded the product carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these are just old, old, old, old, old, old," he muttered. 
</P>
<P>
 But old habits die hard -- Frisbees and Hula Hoops are still going strong, 
although Kransco won't release specific sales figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Knerr nor Melin talks about the old days much; each is apt to change 
the subject when asked, these two fathers of the Hula Hoop. 
</P>
<P>
 Knerr has no plans to see Hollywood's version of the Hula Hoop story. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a farce," he shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
 He speaks briskly about the Wham-O days and asks a reporter who interviews 
him: "This won't take long, will it?" Sure, he misses the place but, he says 
with a chuckle: "I don't think I want to go back to work again." 
</P>
<P>
 Melin is more the raconteur, given to long-winded stories. He saw "The 
Hudsucker Proxy" and liked it, although he thought actor Tim Robbins need a 
little work on his hip action. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're making a story that isn't true, and it may hurt other entrepreneurs," 
he suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 He tends to downplay Wham-O's mark on the world, calling it "just a little 
company." . But he owns up that he taught four of his dogs to catch Frisbees in 
flight. And at 5 feet 10 inches, 145 pounds, he can still keep a Hula Hoop 
going. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't play favorites, but truth be told, he has a soft spot for Frisbee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll always be around," he said confidently. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, how that Frisbee took off. 
</P>
<P>
 "How could just a piece of plastic like that do so good? If we were on a 
desert island, that's the best thing you could have. Especially if the breeze 
is going good. You can throw it over the ocean, and it'll come right back to 
you, if you throw it just right." Having Fun with Plastic 
</P>
<P>
 Wham-O has created some of the world's most popular toys, as well as some that 
were not very successful. HULA HOOP 
</P>
<P>
 * More than 20 million sold within four months of its introduction in 1958 
</P>
<P>
 * Cost $3 in 1958; costs $4 now 
</P>
<P>
 * Plastic tubing for all Hula Hoops placed end to end would circle the globe 
more than five times FRISBEE 
</P>
<P>
 * Fred Morrison, son of the inventor of the sealed beam headlight, combined 
his interest in flight and a new post-World War II substance called "plastic" 
to form the flying disc. 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. Navy spent nearly $400,000 in 1968 to test Frisbee as a vehicle for 
keeping flares aloft; the idea never flew. TWO YOU MAY HAVE MISSED 
</P>
<P>
 * In the 1960s, during Cold War fever, a $119 do-it-yourself bomb shelter 
bombed. 
</P>
<P>
 * The popularity of the movie "Jaws" spawned the creation of "real" plastic 
great white shark teeth in 1975. Only a few sold before they sank from sight. 
OTHER PRODUCTS 
</P>
<P>
 * Girls who wrapped themselves in Silly String found out it didn't come out of 
their hair as easily as the directions said. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the early 1960s, chemical engineer Norman Stingley accidentally created a 
plastic product that bounced uncontrollably. Wham-O bought the product and 
created the Super Ball.

 Esperanza Pipkin, who works at the Grand Hotel front desk in Anaheim, says the 
best part of her job is the people she meets from all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have people staying here from as far away as China, Japan and Australia. I 
like being able to make them feel comfortable away from home," said Pipkin. "It 
has always been my goal to work with people and to help others." 
</P>
<P>
 Pipkin, 37, who has been a front desk clerk for five years, was an office 
clerk in her native Honduras before moving to the United States in 1988. Her 
ability to speak Spanish is an asset in her job, not only in helping guests, 
but also in communicating with Spanish-speaking hotel staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is always a lot to do in this job," she said. "I get my daily workout 
just keeping up with everything that's going on. But after a while the routine 
starts to come naturally."  
</P>
<P>
 Pipkin, who became a supervisor three years ago, also trains new staff members 
on how to work the front desk, answer phones and help the guests get situated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hotel has a teamwork approach," she said. "Management here makes you feel 
like you are wanted and important. I think that helps us make the guests feel 
comfortable in return." OCCUPATION: Hotel front desk clerk 
</P>
<P>
 * Name: Esperanza Pipkin 
</P>
<P>
 * Hotel: Grand Hotel, Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 * What's involved: Front desk clerks register arriving guests and help 
departing guests check out. They make sure guests receive appropriate rooms and 
answer questions about the hotel's facilities. Clerks may also help guests 
obtain information about transportation, restaurants and sightseeing. They are 
often required to help answer the telephone and make reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Qualifications: Most front desk clerks have at least a high school 
education. Knowledge of general office procedures and an ability to work well 
with the public are required. The ability to speak another language besides 
English is extremely helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prospects: One of the 10 fastest-growing job fields in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: By 1998, the number of hotel front desk clerks is projected to 
increase by 20.3%, to 1,720 positions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salary range: Front desk clerks earn $6-$8 an hour. Those on the supervisory 
level earn slightly more. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pros: Experienced front desk clerks report satisfaction from helping others 
and enjoyment from working with international travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cons: Front desk clerks must be able to handle multiple tasks, including 
telephone calls and impatient guests in a hurry to register or check out.  
</P>
<P>
 * Advancement: Most front desk clerks begin as the hotel switchboard operator 
before advancing to the front desk. From there, they can become front desk 
supervisors and then manager of the front office. Some clerks advance to the 
administrative level and may become manager of the hotel's rooms division. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quote: "The guests are the most important part of my job. I work to get 
things done and make sure things are going the way they should be." --

A BRIDGE BETWEEN TWO WORLDS; FERRELL SECAKUKU VALUES TRADITION. BUT THE HOPI 
CHAIRMAN IS PUSHING A MODERN AGENDA TO MOVE THE 10,000-MEMBER TRIBE INTO THE 
21ST CENTURY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ferrell Secakuku, the new chairman of Arizona's Hopi tribe, grew up working in 
his father's trading post, where groceries were often exchanged for the 
pottery, baskets and silver jewelry that are the Hopi artisan's signature. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the traditional way," says the soft-spoken Secakuku, 56, who spent 
his early years on the Hopi reservation, a series of arid villages in the high 
desert of northeastern Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 When his father sent him to Ganado Mission High School, run by the 
Presbyterian Church on the Navajo reservation, he had known little beyond his 
birthplace, the land the Hopi regard as the center of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a total shock," he recalls. "I was a full-fledged Hopi. I didn't even 
know how to speak English and I had no idea the world was made up of many 
difficult, different environments." 
</P>
<P>
 But Secakuku learned fast. Very few Hopi went to college in the 1950s, but 
Secakuku's father had sent him off with instructions to "be somebody." Secakuku 
graduated from Northern Arizona University with a business degree.  
</P>
<P>
 "He told me to learn the white man's ways and lifestyle, and learn their 
business, and then come back and help develop our people. There were no jobs on 
the reservation." 
</P>
<P>
 Secakuku came home with his business degree and converted the family trading 
post to the only supermarket on the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I applied modern techniques," he says. "I introduced self-service, fresh 
produce, a deli section, videotapes, health and beauty aids."  
</P>
<P>
 Secakuku may have learned the white man's ways, but he never abandoned 
tradition. He is the first chairman of the Hopi tribe to be both a businessman 
and fully initiated into the Hopi religious societies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a member of the Snake Clan -- we dance the religious dances."  
</P>
<P>
 When he decided two years ago to run for chairman of his 10,000-member tribe, 
he turned over the business to his family.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have six daughters and they grew up in the business," he says. "I like to 
say that the best man for the job is a woman." 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the reservation tradition of close-knit, extended families, 
Secakuku is divorced. "It's unfortunate," he says. "I think these modern times 
decided for us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Describing himself as a bridge between two worlds, the Hopi chairman has an 
ambitious agenda for development projects in education, jobs, communications, 
business and health care. 
</P>
<P>
 His blueprint for the Hopi people was reiterated on a large scale last week as 
Native American leaders from throughout the country sat down with Clinton 
Administration officials for a "listening conference" that followed a 
high-profile meeting with President Clinton at the White House.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the 500-plus Native American tribes have various special needs, 
depending on their history and location, a common thread running through the 
discussions was a need for more tribal sovereignty. Says Secakuku: "We want to 
move into the 21st Century on our own terms." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Hopi, heading the action list is an issue as old as the tribe itself 
-- water. "It's an issue of extreme urgency," Secakuku says. 
</P>
<P>
 On the landlocked Hopi reservation -- which has an average annual rainfall of 
10 inches -- the sustaining water supply is a naturally pure aquifer, a layer 
of porous rock 3,000 feet underground containing water that bubbles up to the 
surface in springs and washes. 
</P>
<P>
 Water shapes the entire culture. Not only have the Hopi used aquifer water for 
farming, drinking and bathing for 900 years, Secakuku says, but "water is so 
sacred to the Hopi that is it like a bloodline to our heart." 
</P>
<P>
 But for the past few years, the water has been drying up. The washes are dry 
and the springs are disappearing, leading to a classic water-rights dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a lease signed 24 years ago, the St. Louis-based Peabody Western Coal 
Co. mines coal from the Hopi Black Mesa. To transport it to Southern California 
Edison's plant in Nevada, Peabody pulverizes the coal, mixes it with ground 
water and delivers it through a pipeline.  
</P>
<P>
 The unusual process (this is the only slurry line in the continental United 
States) gulps up a billion gallons of aquifer water a year, more than the Hopi 
use in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 And although the Hopi, and the neighboring Navajo Nation, leased both the 
water and coal rights to Peabody -- and consider the mining a business 
partnership -- the Hopi now see the slurry line as draining away their very 
existence as a prolonged drought makes water more precious. "Our land is drying 
up," Secakuku says. "Without water, our entire culture and people are at risk." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Revenues from the mining partnership are essential to the tribal budget and 
Secakuku emphasizes that "no one wants the mining operation to end, but after 
making one mistake, we don't want to further it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hopi have suggested substituting pipeline water from Utah's Lake Powell 
for the ground water. 
</P>
<P>
 In St. Louis, Peabody spokesman Ron Greenfield reiterated the company's 
position that the pumping is not the culprit. "Several studies have been done 
and they've all shown no effect," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Peabody has agreed to study alternatives, Greenfield says, "but 
it won't be a simple process. Water rights in the West are complex and 
controversial." The matter now rests with Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt. 
</P>
<P>
 Secakuku and other tribal leaders were in Los Angeles last month to attend a 
forum, "Energy 2000 and Beyond," at the Sheraton Grande. Relaxing in the hotel 
lobby before lunch, they talked about Hopi self-determination. 
</P>
<P>
 "On one hand, we want to diversify our economy," Secakuku says. "On the other, 
we are trying to reach back and find ourselves as Hopi people." 
</P>
<P>
 The two goals are equal in priority, adds Wayne Taylor, 39, the tribe's new 
vice chairman. That was the message they got from voters when they went 
door-to-door campaigning before the election in February. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strong thing that came out in the campaign," Taylor says, "is that our 
people want to reaffirm our actual beliefs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There is concern that young people aren't carrying on the traditions. "We're 
worried that young Hopi no longer speak their language," says Taylor, who has a 
business administration degree from the University of Arizona. "We're worried 
about the brain drain -- our people move to Flagstaff and Phoenix for jobs. We 
want to develop our economic base." 
</P>
<P>
 Education and scholarships are major items, along with economic development, 
on the action plan Secakuku has drawn up for his four-year term as chairman of 
the Hopi Tribal Council. Composed of representatives from the eight Hopi 
villages, the council meets the first week of each month at tribal headquarters 
in Kykotsmovi Village.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the pastoral look of the reservation -- with its dusty roads, 
vegetable gardens and grazing sheep -- the Hopi do not live as they did 50 
years ago, Secakuku says: "Our lifestyle has changed quite a bit to reflect the 
white man's ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the eight villages have running water pumped from the aquifer and are 
wired for electricity or have solar panels. The tribe has just published its 
first mail-order catalogue for Hopi jewelry, kachina figures, baskets and other 
crafts. 
</P>
<P>
 This is just the beginning, the new tribal leaders say. "We need better 
schools and more economic development so people can get into business," 
Secakuku says. "We need more controlled tourism -- right now (visitors) roam 
around all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Looking toward the 21st Century, they can see potential in tapping Arizona's 
abundant solar energy for rural areas, and in producing their own electrical 
energy through a tribal utility authority. "We're doing a feasibility study for 
a wireless communication system throughout the reservation," Taylor says. 
</P>
<P>
 But heading every list is water. In a mountain of hydrologic studies, position 
papers, congressional hearings and petitions to the Department of the Interior, 
the Hopi have chronicled their growing concern over the continued pumping of 
their ground water. 
</P>
<P>
 When the mining project began 24 years ago, Secakuku says, no one thought it 
would endanger the Hopi water supply. In fact, a U.S. Geologic Survey computer 
model (which has later been questioned) predicted that the pumped water would 
be replenished naturally. 
</P>

 "Even at the time, our Hopi elders were warning us not to do it," Secakuku 
says. "But economy played a big part in the decision.

<P>
 "We don't want to create any hard feelings," he adds, "but we don't want to 
rape our land of water at the expense of the Hopi life."

SHAKE, RATTLE & SPLIT; THE JAN. 17 QUAKE ROCKED SOME FAMILIES TO THEIR VERY 
FOUNDATIONS, INCREASING MARITAL STRESS AND -- PERHAPS -- DIVORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For Kim, the issue was not one of whether to leave, but of how. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks after the Jan. 17 earthquake, with her Northridge home damaged, 
her husband rendered jobless by the disaster and the ground still rolling from 
aftershocks, she found a way. In the midst of being treated for a 
post-traumatic stress disorder, Kim took matters into her own hands, moving 
herself and her two small children to her parents' home in Oregon -- and 
leaving her husband behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The earthquake) propelled her like a shot from a gun," said Dr. Richard 
Ferman, a Northridge psychiatrist who treated Kim. "She wanted to go anyway, 
but she couldn't justify it before. The earthquake gave her the perfect 
excuse." 
</P>
<P>
 This, then, is the latest unhappy consequence of January's devastating 
earthquake. In an eerie echo of a phenomenon that has occurred among survivors 
of such disasters as Hurricane Andrew and the Mount St. Helens eruption, 
divorce and marital stress seem to be on the increase among quake-affected 
Angelenos. 
</P>
<P>
 Although experts caution that it is still too early to make definitive 
correlations, and even though post-quake divorce statistics have not been 
tabulated by Los Angeles County, marriage counselors and psychologists say many 
already troubled relationships have foundered even more following the quake, 
and divorce specialists report that their caseloads are inexorably rising. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm seeing a lot of divorces right now," said Lois Isenberg, a Miracle Mile 
paralegal who estimates that her number of clients has risen about 20% recently 
-- a phenomenon she also witnessed in 1971 following the Sylmar quake. "We had 
more clients last month than we've had in a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, at the Los Angeles Free Clinic, officials say the number of couples 
seeking divorce through the clinic's legal department is up dramatically in the 
past 10 weeks -- about 40% from the same period last year. Observed Richard 
Thor, the clinic's counseling services director: "The quake has put people over 
the edge in situations where they normally would have coped." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the question of whether divorces follow catastrophes is just starting 
to be examined, researchers and psychologists say separations are to be 
expected, given the extraordinary pressures disasters place on people. 
</P>
<P>
 Just eight months after Hurricane Andrew, for example, the number of couples 
seeking divorce in Dade County, Fla., climbed 30%, a figure disaster experts 
predict will grow even higher in several years' time. Psychologists beginning 
to study the effects of last year's Midwest floods on survivors say they also 
expect to see a similar increases in divorce, especially among younger couples. 
</P>
<P>
 "The anecdotal data suggests that (disasters) are a stress that many weak 
marriages do not recover from," said Dr. Charles Figley, director of the 
Psychological Stress Research Program at Florida State University. "When the 
cleanup is over, people sometimes go back to their relationships with a new 
perspective, and sometimes that perspective is not that useful for the 
relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers give several reasons for the upswing in separations. Paramount 
among them is the host of psychological conditions any disaster can trigger in 
survivors, including anxiety, depression and a rise in psychosomatic 
complaints. Domestic violence and substance abuse can also increase, experts 
say, and in extreme cases, survivors may suffer lingering bouts of 
post-traumatic stress disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of unhappy spouses such as Kim, disasters can also serve to 
"crystallize people's thinking" and enable them to act upon their subconscious 
thoughts, said Dr. Kenneth Manges, a Cincinnati psychiatrist who specializes in 
treating people affected by catastrophes. Indeed, for survivors, the cliched 
"moment of truth" is one that occurs frequently in disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not uncommon for a person facing death to make decisions that had been 
lying dormant," Manges said. "There's the sense of, 'If I live through this, 
I'm going to do things differently.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Margery Shelton, director of clinical training at the California Family 
Studies Center in North Hollywood, concurred: "It clears up a lot of gray 
areas. Some people have said, 'I was thinking of leaving my spouse, and as a 
result of the earthquake, I realize that I must.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That was exactly the thought that flooded the mind of Tina, a college 
instructor in her 30s from Los Angeles, who nearly left her husband on the 
afternoon after the quake. She was on the verge of hailing a cab to the airport 
and was prevented only by the fact that "I couldn't make up my mind where I 
wanted to go. Otherwise, I would have left." She is attempting to reconcile 
with her husband.  
</P>
<P>
 Then again, some couples find their relationship better as a result of having 
rallied around each other in a time of crisis. Ruben Murillo, a coordinator 
with Project Rebound, a quake recovery program that provides mental health 
services, escaped the disaster with just the clothes on his back. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his Sylmar home was destroyed, Murillo credits the quake for making 
his 28-year marriage even stronger. "When you're standing outside among the 
ruins, that should help you see that what's important is each other," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Los Angeles divorce attorney Patricia Phillips said she was handling 
the divorce of two couples -- each of whom suffered through November's fires 
and January's quake -- when both couples decided to reconcile. "Together, they 
felt they could probably make it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers say this response is also common but warn that in instances where 
the "pre-disaster" state of the marriage was weak, old problems and issues are 
likely to recur, and perhaps even be exacerbated with new dilemmas arising from 
the disaster. In such marriages, the added pressure of a catastrophe may not be 
the primary factor fueling discord, but may well become the stress that finally 
overwhelms a struggling couple. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a real survival response, and people try to protect what is closest 
to them," said Dr. John Freedy, who heads a $1.5-million National Institute of 
Mental Health study on the survivors of five major catastrophes, including 
hurricanes Andrew and Hugo. "But that could give way very quickly to 
depression, frustration and aggression between people if their needs aren't 
being met." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, Florida State's Figley anticipates that the true effects of 
Hurricane Andrew on divorcing couples will be felt one to four years from now. 
"I expect the rates to be much higher later," he said. "Right now, they're 
still in the recovery stage."  
</P>
<P>
 If so, such couples are only beginning to process their disaster experience. 
The Family Studies Center's Shelton identifies four phases that those affected 
by disaster generally pass through on their way to recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The first, she said, is a joining together in the face of crisis. This is 
often followed by a period of emotional and physical exhaustion as couples tire 
of managing the disaster -- and each other. If the couple sticks together, 
Shelton said, the next phase is reorganization, in which normal routines are 
again enjoined in the aftermath of the crisis.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, if this is successfully negotiated, couples may experience a renewal 
in which they gain new understandings from their experience. But because 
various and often conflicting emotions may be felt by people at different 
stages of the process, Shelton recommends that couples not make important life 
decisions until they have gone through all the phases toward recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't ignore your feelings, but don't make hasty decisions," she said, adding 
that although judgments made in the heat of the moment can end up to be good 
ones, time is needed to absorb the impact of catastrophic events. "Disasters do 
present opportunity for growth."

<P>
 We'd like to say we were able to get tickets to "Late Show" tapings in L.A. We 
would also like to be younger and more attractive. That might be easier. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, we'll be sending you the first 10 Laugh Lines Humor Master T-shirts 
-- just as soon as they're off the press. These shirts will be awarded only to 
winners of LL contests and indeed signify that the wearer is a humor master. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 So how did we select the winners? 
</P>
<P>
 Since last Monday morning, we have received hundreds of letters and faxes that 
offered thousands of reasons for Dave to move his show to L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Each entry was read, and a list of about 250 of the best were selected for 
consideration by the Laugh Lines Supreme Court. The court narrowed the list to 
about 30 and then voted again, coming up with the Top 10. 
</P>
<P>
 We realize, of course, that humor is subjective. In that vein, and to give you 
even more reason to question our choices, below is a sampling of other 
finalists. (names of submitters are omitted because of space considerations).

<P>
 There are a lot of funny people in Southern California, and we thank you for 
entering. We hope you'll find upcoming contests fun. 
</P>
<P>

FIRST PERSON: THE RULES OF DATING AT A 'CERTAIN AGE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH BURNS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Judith Burns is a free-lance writer who 
lives in Studio City. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am "a woman of a certain age." What a nice sounding euphemism, I tell 
myself. I have begun to date again after 24 years -- following a year spent 
going with my ex-husband before marrying him, 22 years of marriage and a year 
as a DJF (Divorced Jewish Female). 
</P>
<P>
 The few times I've been out with a man, I tell myself that it is just a date, 
nothing more. This time there's a difference. It's the first time someone has 
"fixed me up" and said, "You two will get along. I know you're good for each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 My friend Ellen goes on to tell me: "He wears a hearing aid also," as if that 
means we have a lot in common. No one has ever tried to fix me up with someone 
by telling me that he is left-handed like me, or wears glasses, as I do. But I 
shouldn't complain. Not many people are trying to act as a matchmaker for those 
of us of a certain age. 
</P>
<P>
 We're going to a movie, and I'm worried. I'm profoundly hearing impaired. I go 
only to foreign films with subtitles and wait for the rest of the movies to 
come out on closed-captioned video. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first non-foreign movie I'll be going to in several years. Ellen 
offers to go to the movie with me the day before and explain it so I can have 
an intelligent conversation about it afterward. I am shocked when I find myself 
seriously considering this plan.  
</P>
<P>
 The advice comes flooding in. My matchmaker friend reminds me, "Don't go to 
bed with him on the first date. He's a nice man." I wonder what she means by 
that: He's a nice man. Like nice men don't go to bed with women on the first 
date. I vaguely remember when that was said about "nice women." 
</P>
<P>
 She goes on to say, "He may try to get you to bed, but some men use that as a 
test." A test for what, I want to know. I assure her that I wouldn't think of 
going to bed with him on the first date. "He's safe," I assure her. "Women of a 
certain age seldom go to bed with a man on the first date." 
</P>
<P>
 I ask Ellen if I should offer this live bait a bite to eat before we go to the 
show. Her answer is an emphatic: "No. Don't overwhelm him. Play it cool." 
</P>
<P>
 This dating business is still new to me. 
</P>
<P>
 Deciding what to wear isn't easy. The last time I did any real dating, I was 
stuffing my bra with toilet paper. Now I'm a 36C. 
</P>
<P>
 If it's raining out I can't wear my good heels. They'd get ruined. It's not 
like the old days, when I was married. Not only didn't it matter what I wore, 
but I had more than one good pair of shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen continues to advise me. "Wear something sexy. Men like feminine women." 
</P>
<P>
 Her admonitions are confusing. Don't go to bed with him, but wear something 
sexy? I hadn't planned on wearing my army fatigues, but I had better put on a 
silk blouse and skirt instead of a warm sweater and slacks. Catching pneumonia 
in an attempt to catch a man may be necessary. A small price for a woman of a 
certain age to pay.

MAD ABOUT YOU; ANGER, WHEN MANAGED, CAN ADD SPICE TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP. LEFT 
UNCHECKED, IT CAN TEAR THE TWO OF YOU APART. THE TRICK IS TO KEEP YOUR COOL 
WHEN THINGS GET HOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A little anger directed your way from your spouse may not be fun, "but it is 
functional in a marriage, and that gets it out in the open," says psychologist 
John Gottman. 
</P>
<P>
 A leading researcher in identifying predictors of successful marriages, 
Gottman has started the Anger Project at the University of Washington to 
investigate the functional and dysfunctional forms of getting hot under the 
collar. 
</P>
<P>
 He reports that the latest scientific evidence on anger supports what many 
therapists are finding out there in the trenches of marital discord: that 
expressing anger in the right ways is good for a marriage, while expressing it 
inappropriately can be the death knell of a relationship.  
</P>
<P>
 By noting voice tone, expressions and nonverbal behavior of his research 
subjects, Gottman has separated what he calls "pure anger" -- when people who 
are upset say so and attempt to talk it out -- from other forms of anger, 
including belligerence, provocation, domination and defensive expressions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It turns out that pure anger is not harmful," says the author of "Why 
Marriages Succeed or Fail" (Simon & Schuster). "It functions like putting your 
words in italics. It gets people's attention. We have a little bit of evidence 
that it actually is good in a marriage. But these other forms of anger 
expression -- the belligerent and defensive forms -- are very dysfunctional and 
are predictive of divorce." 
</P>
<P>
 Other studies have reached similar conclusions. University of Wisconsin 
researchers who have been measuring brain activity associated with different 
emotions have found that fear and sadness show activity on the right frontal 
lobe of the brain. The brain's left hemisphere lights up meters when subjects 
are happy, amused or interested. "That also is true for anger," Gottman says. 
"It's on the left with other positive emotions." 
</P>
<P>
 Studies at the University of Alabama demonstrate that women tend to cool down 
and relax after experiencing anger, whereas men tend to stay angry. "Men are 
more likely to have distress-maintaining thoughts (righteous indignation or 
feeling like an innocent victim blended with sadness and disappointment) than 
women," Gottman says. "They keep thinking about things, which makes retaliation 
more likely." 
</P>
<P>
 At Catholic University in Washington, D.C., psychology professor Clifford 
Notarius, who has been studying happy and unhappy couples for 20 years, finds 
that anger that is not dealt with constructively "is the signature of a 
distressed relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 That destructive anger, he explains, often is fueled by "a series of hot 
thoughts" that serve as explanations for the disappointment or injury felt. 
</P>
<P>
 The trick to defusing an explosive situation, says the co-author of "We Can 
Work It Out" (Putnam), is to make those explanations specific and operable to 
the moment. When your partner is 45 minutes late for your anniversary dinner, 
for instance, thinking, "He's probably caught in a terrible traffic jam," is 
much less agitating than, "He never watches the time," or, "He's always putting 
other people before me," or, "He's an inconsiderate jerk." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Notarius: "Those kinds of thoughts will have important implications (as 
to) what happens when your partner arrives." 
</P>
<P>
 In his research, Gottman has been measuring another indicator that may provide 
some clues to when anger crosses the line of effectiveness. "If your heart rate 
is over 100 beats a minute, you can't really listen very well," he says. "And 
not only can't you take in information very well, but you tend to rely on older 
learned behaviors" -- namely the dysfunctional run-or-attack forms.  
</P>
<P>
 "The heart betrays the mind at that point," Gottman says, explaining that just 
as in physical exercise, where there's an optimum range for heart rate, the 
same is true when exercising one's anger. Assuming that in a fit of rage you 
have the wherewithal to check your pulse, "keep it below 95 beats per minute."

COMMITMENTS; PLAY THE BLAME GAME -- AND LOSE; CAN THIS MARRIAGE BE SAVED?

<P>
 "We're in counseling because Bob thinks I'm the sick one," says Linda, 37, a 
petite brunette dressed in an expensive designer pantsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "He accuses me of being a shopaholic. I admit that sometimes I spend more than 
I should, but what does he expect? I need a little happiness in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 It's been a difficult year for Linda. Although she finally gave birth to a 
healthy boy six months ago after years of infertility, her mother -- her best 
friend -- died of a heart attack. Shortly thereafter, her father closed his 
dental practice and moved in with her and Bob. On top of that, Bob's 
construction business is doing poorly. 
</P>
<P>
 Most days, Linda reports, Bob comes home and screams at her. "Whenever I dare 
to cry, Bob gives me a withering look and barks: 'Snap out of it.' He thinks I 
have a shopping problem. Well, I'm positive he has a drinking problem." Bob 
doesn't drink a lot, or often, she says, but "even a few glasses of wine and he 
goes berserk." The other day, he shouted obscenities at her in a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob, 40, is tired of being portrayed as the heartless husband who yells at his 
poor little wife every time she buys a few clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't bother to say that her purchases put us $10,000 in debt. How can 
she do that when she knows I'm struggling to earn every penny?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he sympathizes with Linda's loss of her mother, he believes that it's 
time for her to get on with her life. "I know I shouldn't yell at Linda in 
front of others, but her shopping sprees provoke me. And she has the nerve to 
suggest I have a drinking problem. That's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Linda and Bob are a classic example of each partner having a serious problem 
but refusing to acknowledge it completely, preferring instead to blame the 
spouse," says Ilse Ross, a counselor with the Family Service League in 
Huntington, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Grieving for her mother and saddled with the needs of a baby and a despondent 
father, Linda is overwhelmed. She needs someone to listen to her expressions of 
sadness and anxiety without being made to feel guilty about it. Nevertheless, 
she has to admit that she has a habit of shopping and overspending. Similarly, 
Bob clearly has a problem with alcohol. Frequent and excessive alcohol 
consumption is not the only symptom of alcoholism; people like Bob, who undergo 
disturbing personality changes after only a few drinks, also have a problem. 
Acknowledging it is the first step in controlling it. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples break out of the blaming impasse when they give up needing to be 
right, take responsibility for their behavior and make healing the relationship 
a priority. 
</P>
<P>
 This exercise will help Linda and Bob, as well as other couples trapped in a 
cycle of righteous blaming: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Think of an issue that's causing pain in your relationship.

TAKING HOLLYWOOD BY SNOWSTORM

 Hit: With delicious irony, a seen-it-all, done-it-all Hollywood crowd passed 
over the footprints of Cecil B. DeMille and other late, great show people at 
Mann's Chinese Theater tosee an extravaganza staged by Isaac Mizrahi, a New 
York fashion designer, and his pack of supermodels (Linda Evangelista, Christy 
Turlington, Veronica Webb). For final punch -- ifyou don't count the faux snow 
that came down on the already cool crowd -- there was k.d. lang crooning with a 
Lawrence Welk-style bubble machine, followed by dinner in a fabulous tent. It 
was all to benefit the California Fashion Industry Friends of AIDS Project Los 
Angeles on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss: An insensitive, well, OK, just plain rude contingent walked out early on 
lang's concert, prompting her to cut short her show in retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: A few transvestites; clusters of People in Black trying to 
outsmart the fire marshals by sneaking puffs on Marlboro Lights in the tent; 
plus Dan Aykroyd and Donna Dixon, Anjelica Huston and Robert Graham, Sandra 
Bernhard ("This was the best night in Hollywood ever"), Jon Lovitz, Wayne and 
Janet Gretzky, Natalie Cole, Raquel Welch, Dennis Hopper, APLA chair Steve 
Tisch, Barry Levinson, Linda Gray, Mark and Wendy Canton, Linda and Jerry 
Bruckheimer, and Sofia Coppola. 
</P>
<P>
 Say That Again: "It's the Oscars of tall chicks," pontificated Josh Richman, 
co-owner of Babylon (that's a restaurant, but you probably knew that). "They 
can say it's for AIDS and I hope they raise a lot of money, but it's basically 
a spectacle, and that's what people are here for." 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "I wouldn't have done this if it wasn't at the Chinese. It's like the 
Louvre of California, one of the natural wonders of the world," said Mizrahi as 
a fire marshal insisted he extinguish his ever-present cigarette.  
</P>
<P>
 Triumph: The circus-sized dinner tent behind the theater, filled with hundreds 
of red paper lanterns, tablecloths of red Chinese brocade and centerpieces of 
melon-sized pink peonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion Statements: Actress Lauren Tom in Pamela Barish's sheer white 
baby-doll dress with exposed black push-up bra. Producer Susan Harris in 
Mizrahi's mint green taffeta ball-gown skirt, old cardigan sweater, pink suede 
mules and backpack. 
</P>
<P>
 Chow: Tommy Tang's wild mushroom salad with egg rolls, crispy duck with 
grilled yam, steamed rice and, for dessert, mango and berry creme brulee, 
chocolate truffles and fortune cookies with such funny fortunes as, "Could you 
be pregnant?" and "Steve Tisch wants to make a deal with you." 
</P>
<P>
 Freebie Factor: lang's "Ingenue" compact disc, a white baseball cap 
monogrammed "IM," plus all the peonies you could grab.

4 SENIOR L.A. PHILHARMONIC MUSICIANS TO LEAVE ORCHESTRA; MUSIC: PRINCIPAL 
CONCERTMASTER SIDNEY WEISS IS RESIGNING TODAY. CELLIST NINO ROSSO, VIOLIST 
IRVING MANNING AND TROMBONIST RALPH SAUER ARE LEAVING AT THE END OF THE SEASON.

<P>
 At least four senior members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic will be leaving 
the orchestra by the end of this season. Among them is principal concertmaster 
Sidney Weiss, who has held the first chair position with the orchestra since 
1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Violinist Weiss, 65, said his resignation is effective today. He said he 
planned to notify his colleagues Sunday, at the time of his final concert with 
them at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I resigned from the orchestra for personal reasons," Weiss said Friday. When 
asked if his departure was amicable, he replied, "Of course." 
</P>
<P>
 Ernest Fleischmann, the orchestra's executive vice president and managing 
director called Weiss "a man of tremendous integrity and a superb violinist. I 
think he earned the respect of musicians, conductors and soloists as well as 
his section. They respect him as much for his violin playing as for his human 
qualities."  
</P>
<P>
 An orchestra's principal concertmaster is responsible for setting the tone of 
the first violin section, serves as liaison between the conductor and the 
strings and plays orchestral solos. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander Treger, the orchestra's 45-year-old concertmaster, will assume 
Weiss' duties for now, Fleischmann said. Treger will also lead the orchestra on 
its tour of Europe this summer. "There's no problem in having Alex lead the 
orchestra," Fleischmann said. "He's done it often enough. It doesn't create a 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Treger will not automatically become principal concertmaster, however. 
Fleischmann said music director Esa-Pekka Salonen "will doubtless meet with the 
relevant committees of the orchestra and a search will begin." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant principal cellist Nino Rosso and violist Irving Manning both plan to 
retire in September, at the end of this season. Both men joined the orchestra 
in 1956, two years before Salonen was born. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning, 78, said he had been thinking about his retirement for a year now and 
hopes to do more chamber music work. Rosso said he also plans to pursue chamber 
music, as well as teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Sauer, one of the orchestra's two principal trombone players, said he is 
also leaving the orchestra at the end of the season "to pursue other 
interests." Sauer, 49, joined the orchestra in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if Salonen is making personnel changes, Fleischmann sidestepped the 
question, saying that "a music director has continually to do whatever is best 
for the orchestra. He's responsible for the personnel and has to see the 
personnel is used in the best way." 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss has worked for several of the nation's best orchestras. After 10 years 
under conductor George Szell at the Cleveland Orchestra, he left in the 
mid-1960s to play for Zubin Mehta in Los Angeles. He was here less than a year 
before heading to Chicago to become co-concertmaster at the Chicago Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago born and raised, Weiss remained with the Chicago Symphony from 1967 to 
1972. He then left for Europe to pursue a solo career as well as recitals with 
his wife, pianist Jeanne Weiss, with whom he has long performed as the Weiss 
Duo. He became concertmaster of the Orchestre National de l'Opera de Monte 
Carlo (now the Monte Carlo Philharmonic) in 1973, and was there six years 
before returning to Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 Weiss became concertmaster of the Los Angeles Philharmonic in October, 1979, 
replacing Sidney Harth. The invitation came from Carlo Maria Giulini, with whom 
he'd worked during his tenure in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking ahead, Weiss said he and Jeanne Weiss, his wife of 40 years, intend to 
do "a great deal more playing" as the Weiss Duo. "The most important thing to 
me in the world is playing the violin well and doing justice to music. That is 
what I have always tried to do and what I will continue to try to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been very fortunate to work with violinists of such high caliber. It's 
been for me a great, great privilege to work with them. Their ability as 
individual players and as a collective ensemble is exceptional."

PARAMOUNT'S MONEYMAN MAKES HIS PRESENCE FELT; MOVIES: JONATHAN DOLGEN, THE 
NEWLY HIRED CHAIRMAN OF VIACOM ENTERTAINMENT GROUP, HAS MOVED INTO HIS OFFICE 
AND, DESPITE HIS REPUTATION AS A FISCAL HAWK, SAYS 'THERE IS NO BLOODLETTING.' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Surrounded by translucent turquoise waters and virtually cut off from the 
world of Hollywood, Paramount Pictures Chairman Sherry Lansing and her director 
husband, William Friedkin, were vacationing on the Caribbean island of Mustique 
when the urgent phone call came. 
</P>
<P>
 For three days, Lansing's corporate boss, Jonathan Dolgen, had been holed up 
in London trying to hammer out a deal to bring actor Michael Douglas' 
production company to the studio's Melrose Avenue lot. Disney and Warner Bros. 
were also aggressively vying for Douglas and his new producing partner, Steven 
Reuther, to set up shop under their banners. 
</P>
<P>
 After marathon negotiations, Dolgen had the financial aspects of the deal 
nailed down but told Lansing over the phone that she had to immediately fly to 
New York to work out the creative aspects of the arrangement with Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
 "But all I have are a pair of shorts and a bathing suit!" said Lansing, as 
waves lapped in the distance. Scrounging up a pair of jeans, she rushed for a 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
 As Lansing walked into the elegant dining room of the Carlyle Hotel in 
Manhattan on May 1, Douglas took one look at her and quipped, "What is this? 
The head of Paramount Pictures is coming into the Carlyle's dining room wearing 
blue jeans?" Sharing a laugh, the longtime friends who had collaborated on such 
films as "Fatal Attraction" and "Black Rain" then got down to business. 
</P>
<P>
 The Douglas deal couldn't have come at a better time for Paramount. For 
months, it had struggled to get movies made while an air of uncertainty hung 
over the studio because of a corporate merger battle being waged on Wall 
Street. All Hollywood wondered who would take control of the parent corporation 
-- Sumner Redstone's Viacom Inc. or Barry Diller's QVC Network? Redstone 
finally won. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, there is a new corporate ownership in New York, and Dolgen has been 
brought in to oversee movies and television as chairman of Viacom Entertainment 
Group. Dolgen's role involves signing off on Paramount budgets and helping line 
up financing for co-productions, while Lansing retains authority to pick the 
movies the studio will make. 
</P>
<P>
 A former Sony Pictures Entertainment executive, Dolgen was installed only five 
weeks ago as head of newly created Viacom Entertainment Group. He came to 
Paramount with a reputation as a fiscal hawk -- although while at Sony he 
pulled off some big-number production deals with director James Brooks and 
actor Damon Wayans. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, his hiring by Paramount prompted speculation that he would aggressively 
slash costs and make sweeping changes in the studio hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 While the costs to Paramount of the Douglas/Reuther deal have not been 
disclosed, the deal itself has been well-received by the film community. 
Douglas and Reuther are reportedly in the midst of lining up independent 
production coin from foreign sources for the venture, while Paramount will 
presumably be responsible for marketing/distribution and other costs. "We don't 
know how much of the kingdom they had to give away to get that deal," said 
entertainment attorney David Colden, "but, nonetheless, in terms of visibility 
to the film community and in terms of reducing their downside risks, my 
suspicions are it's a fairly favorable deal." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think when you hire Jonathan Dolgen, you send a signal," said one agent. 
"He knows what his mandate was and he's going to take some dramatic steps to 
put his imprimatur on the state of being of Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 "When's the midnight massacre?" the agent then quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether Paramount was in for massive cuts, Dolgen declined to get 
specific but said every company must look for ways to "run our business as 
sensibly as we can." However, he strongly denied rumors that any high-level 
staff shake-up was in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no bloodletting," Dolgen said. "We're just going to try and marshal 
our assets to run our business as sensibly as we can and move forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors of a bloodletting began almost from the day Dolgen arrived. Seeking an 
office as large as Lansing's, he demanded that distribution chief Barry London 
and production head John Goldwyn relocate. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolgen then turned Goldwyn's office into a conference room and London was sent 
to Dressing Room Building 100 so that Dolgen could have an office and 
conference room. 
</P>
<P>
 But London, who has held his post or variations of it since 1984, is said to 
have plunged into a funk after the move. Sources said London has been going 
through "a kind of midlife crisis, where he was seeing too much turmoil in the 
company" and for a long time has considered relinquishing his studio executive 
stripes to become a producer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barry, who always needs human contact, spun out over all this, and it created 
sort of a dark malaise over all the company because he wasn't being wooed or 
comforted," said one source. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldwyn, at least, remained in the Administration Building, just down the hall 
from Dolgen. But in what some consider a face-saving move, the production 
president wants to tear down the wall to an adjacent business affairs office. 
Goldwyn claims it is simply a move to create additional file space. 
</P>
<P>
 Some also saw signs of pending changes when Lansing tossed a party for London 
on March 29, his 23rd anniversary with the studio. London had been called into 
a conference room ostensibly for a meeting and was surprised to find a cake and 
champagne. 
</P>
<P>
 The party would have gone largely unnoticed had it been London's 20th or 25th 
anniversary, industry insiders said. But 23rd? 
</P>
<P>
 "It was strange," said one source, wondering if this was a send-off of some 
sort. 
</P>
<P>
 If all this speculation sounds a bit petty, it clearly underscores the 
ego-driven nature of what goes on in executive suites. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of being ousted from their offices and London's odd 23rd 
anniversary party was enough to send tongues wagging, much to the displeasure 
of London and Goldwyn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm certainly not in a funk or a midlife crisis," protested London. But he 
added, "You reach points in your life where you have to reach certain 
decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the already uncertain air and jittery nerves among Paramount 
insiders about potentially more executive changes in the production ranks, 
Goldwyn -- who has been in his current post for 2 1/2 years -- says, "I've got 
some time on my contract." He added, "Sherry and Jonathan have gone out of 
their way to embrace me." A Paramount source said in fact Goldwyn has recently 
been offered a contract extension. He acknowledged that, in his position, there 
are always people gunning for his job. But how something as mundane as office 
space can trigger gossip is beyond him. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer could be a critical period for Paramount, which has a lot of money 
riding on several big $40-million-plus movies: "Beverly Hills Cop III," 
starring Eddie Murphy, "Clear and Present Danger," starring Harrison Ford, and 
"Forrest Gump," starring Oscar-winner Tom Hanks. 
</P>
<P>
 There are especially high hopes for the $45-million "Forrest Gump," directed 
by Robert Zemeckis, which, according to sources, has received the highest test 
scores in Paramount history. The movie, which has a lot of special effects and 
stars Robin Wright, opens July 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Another possible sleeper for Paramount could be the TV-to-movie version of 
"Lassie," a family movie whose trailer was very well-received by exhibitors at 
the recent ShoWest convention in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood observers have been critical of some of Paramount's marketing 
decisions, particularly where smaller films such as "What's Eating Gilbert 
Grape?," starring Johnny Depp, and "Flesh and Bone," teaming Dennis Quaid and 
Meg Ryan, were concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount's defenders say every studio has its share of movies that stumble 
out of the starting gate. A recent example is the comedy "Jimmy Hollywood," 
starring Joe Pesci and Christian Slater, which has made an anemic $3.7 million 
after 33 days in release. 
</P>
<P>
 But Arthur Cohen, head of worldwide marketing -- whose contract doesn't expire 
until January of 1996 -- is quick to stress the accomplishments that 
Paramount's marketing staff has achieved: "The Firm" brought in $45 million at 
the box office in its first six days; "Boomerang" took in $19 million in five 
days; "Naked Gun 33 1/3" grossed $13 million, the biggest opening to date this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very pleased with the marketing and distribution of all of our films," 
Lansing said. "Not every picture can be a hit, but I think each picture was 
maximized to its potential. Sometimes, the movie god just doesn't shine on 
you."

SAYING SO LONG TO BILLABLE HOURS; TELEVISION: 'L.A. LAW'S' FINALE WILL COMPLETE 
FILMING TODAY, BUT THE CHARACTERS' STORIES WON'T BE TIED UP IN A NEAT PACKAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In perhaps the most memorable moment in "L.A. Law's" eight-year run, Rosalind 
Shays, the uncongenial but shrewd litigator brought in to boost the firm's 
droopy revenues, mistakenly stepped into an empty elevator shaft and plummeted 
to her death. 
</P>
<P>
 But as fitting as it might be to conclude the storied series with a group 
plunge down an elevator shaft -- after all, the stars of the show all play 
lawyers -- the final episode of "L.A. Law" isn't so final. The firm won't go up 
in flames. An earthquake doesn't bury anyone in the underground parking lot.  
</P>
<P>
 The only really conclusive event of "L.A. Law's" swan song, which completes 
filming today for a May 19 telecast on NBC, is that Leland McKenzie (played by 
Richard Dysart), the firm's soft-spoken senior partner, announces his 
retirement after learning he has prostate cancer. Whether he lives or dies, no 
one is telling. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the firm lives or dies, no one is telling either, but many of the cast 
members hold out hope that they will be able to do a two-hour TV movie of "L.A. 
Law" sometime soon that will deliver a more definitive verdict than this 
episode.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think viewers will be left wanting to know more about what happens to these 
people," Dysart said. "When we came on eight years ago, we were hot. We were a 
hit from the middle of the first show. We were a classy show in the true sense 
of the word, and I believe it should go out in a classy way. I don't sense that 
has happened here, because the hour form just won't accommodate all the 
characters we have and the producers didn't have enough lead time to prepare 
for it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mark Tinker, one of the show's co-executive producers, said they are 
"trying not to do a typical wrap-up show where all the things in the package 
get a neat little bow in them. Without trying to take each character and have a 
little story that gives you some finality to that person or their situation, 
we're just trying to make it a continuing slice of life where some rather large 
changes are going on within the context of the office and how people react to 
that. I don't think that viewers will have a complete sense of closure, but I'm 
not sure that is bad, because that gives the impression that these characters 
have a life beyond this place." 
</P>
<P>
 On the set for filming of the final conference room scene -- the one constant 
that was included in all 173 episodes -- things got a little personal. After 
the actors performed their final exchange, they received hugs, kisses and slaps 
on the back from their colleagues. As Jill Eikenberry (who plays Ann Kelsey) 
recited her last lines in that glass-enclosed room, she choked up for real. And 
as the crew broke for lunch, their work on that particular set done forever, 
Corbin Bernsen (Arnie Becker) cried.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's more emotional than I thought it was going to be," said Michael Tucker, 
who is Eikenberry's husband both in real life and on the show (Stuart 
Markowitz). "It sort of sneaks up on you, even though we can't say we were 
surprised that NBC pulled the plug. They have been mulling it over for a while. 
The show almost ended a few times before, and some people think that it should 
have. Yet we really got it back this final year after a couple of bad ones. It 
would have been a shame if it ended last year, when we were all over the place 
and really weren't doing 'L.A. Law.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. Law" departs as one of the most decorated dramas in TV history, having 
won 15 Emmys -- including four as best dramatic series. Created by Steven 
Bochco and Terry Louise Fisher, an attorney turned television producer, the 
show was Bochco's "Hill Street Blues" in yuppie clothes -- featuring an 
ensemble cast, contemporary and often controversial legal issues, sexy personal 
entanglements and a compelling story mix of the tear-jerking with the macabre.  
</P>
<P>
 In a nasty dispute with Bochco, Fisher left the show early on. Bochco himself 
said goodby following the show's third season to devote himself to producing 
new shows under a mega-deal with ABC. He left the series in the hands of a 
young ex-lawyer named David E. Kelley, who wrote nearly every episode in years 
four and five -- with a major assist from the show's current executive 
producer, William M. Finkelstein, another former lawyer. Many fans consider 
these years, which included the Rosalind Shays story line, the show's best, and 
Kelly won best drama Emmys in both seasons before leaving to create "Picket 
Fences" for CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 But cast defections began to plague the show -- Harry Hamlin, Susan Dey and 
Jimmy Smits all left -- and the series, without an ex-lawyer/producer at its 
helm, lost its way in years six and seven. Bochco said in an interview that 
despite his input as creative consultant during that period, the show 
floundered badly and the audience turned away. Tucker said he remembers reading 
scripts and thinking, "We're dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Finkelstein, who had left to create and produce "Civil Wars" with Bochco, 
returned to the series at the end of last season and oversaw it this year as 
well, and those involved contend that "L.A. Law" found its old voice again. It 
also inched up a bit in the ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 But with a veteran cast pulling in huge salaries each week, "L.A. Law" is 
extremely expensive, costing more than $1.6 million an episode to make. And 
while he said he believes "L.A. Law" still has a lot of life left in it, Bochco 
speculated that it would be more cost effective for NBC to replace it with a 
new drama or a newsmagazine. 
</P>
<P>
 In its prime, blessed with the Thursday time slot behind "Cosby" and "Cheers," 
the series regularly finished in the top 15. Its legal cases -- on such topics 
as the outing of prominent gays, dwarf tossing, the court-martial of a U.S. 
soldier who disobeyed orders to fire on civilian targets during the invasion of 
Panama, the morality of the death penalty and the culpability of a Jewish mohel 
sued for snipping a bit too much at a circumcision ceremony -- prompted 
discussion among lawyers and laymen alike. 
</P>
<P>
 And the romance -- Hamlin dressing up in a gorilla suit to woo Dey, Tucker 
employing a secret sexual technique called the "Venus Butterfly" to win the 
hand of Eikenberry, Amanda Donohoe kissing colleague Michele Greene in a 
much-ballyhooed lesbian embrace -- likely prompted at least a few imitators or 
fantasies at least among the show's many fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the appeal is that it was about the workplace, and everyone can 
identify with that, with the hierarchy and pecking order and back-stabbing," 
Eikenberry said. "And I think people like to see shows about lawyers, 
especially one that humanizes them, because I think lawyers are a little 
intimidating to the average person. But mostly I think it was the mixing of the 
comic with the tragic, the dark with the light -- like life." 
</P>
<P>
 "We were the mirror of that Reagan-Bush, 1980s era of greed and lust and this 
kind of out-of-control, searching-for-a-soul kind of society," Bernsen said. "I 
think our society is still looking for a soul, but we're more on the right 
track now and that's why the show is kind of over. It signified an era, and 
what it will be remembered for is that it captured what people were going 
through. They could turn it on each week and have some sort of recognition of 
the kind of society they lived in."

 Joyce Lightbody is a visual artist with as much interest in music as painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by Conceptual artists who believed that art could manifest itself in 
almost any activity, for 10 years she composed a cappella choral music. Two 
years ago, she was invited to compose an instrumental piece for the carillon at 
UC Santa Barbara. Along the way, she exhibited her scores in alternative and 
institutional spaces, but commercial galleries remained leery. Until now. Her 
first solo show in many years titled "Su-pine-Prone/Prone-Su-pine" is at Food 
House through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Food House is known as an ambitious gallery combining the vision of an 
adventurous alternative space with realistic commercial instincts. It has 
acquired a significant reputation by showing work by the city's younger 
artists, many of them just out of graduate school. Lightbody, who has taught 
for many years at Otis College of Art and Design and at UCLA, found that her 
students had carried their enthusiasm for her stamp collages to Food House's 
Randy Sommers. He says, "We felt she'd been unrecognized, especially when seen 
against the quality of her work, how distinctive it is and how long she'd been 
working." Other Food House partners Stephen Hartzog and Robert Gunderman had 
Lightbody as a teacher at Otis. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a particularly important show for Lightbody, because all of the work 
was made since the recent Malibu fires destroyed her home of 11 years. In the 
fires she lost most of her possessions and, worse, a career's worth of art. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always made little collages for friends, so at least I can go to their 
houses and see (the work)," she says of the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Although her works were never very large, her collages of the last six months 
are approximately six by seven inches. They were all created atop a drawing 
board in the corner of the one-room apartment she now rents from friends in 
Topanga Canyon. Tiny as they are, they tell an extraordinary tale of 
transcendence from literal ashes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased with the scale because it puts the viewer in touch with what 
their perception is. One viewer has the experience at a time. You can't have a 
crowd of people standing around these things." 
</P>
<P>
 The collages appear at first glance to be simple designs, but after a few 
moments they coalesce as maps. Land masses are designated by piles of tiny 
fragments of stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 Of her post-fire work Lightbody says, "I think my ability to let pieces just 
speak for themselves, and take whatever turn they are going to, is easier for 
me. I seem to be much more willing to relax into that process and let whatever 
their content is come out through the process of doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Lightbody's version of letting loose is relative. To the casual 
observer, the work still looks pretty controlled. Using manicure scissors, she 
has cut out the figures, architectural elements, animals and fancy borders from 
tens of thousands of stamps and organized them according to subject in muffin 
tins and tea cups. She determines the structure of each collage through 
cartographic projections, then decorates with stamps as well as elements of 
musical composition and phonetic language. In their eccentricity, the works 
recall the drawings and collages of metaphysical artists like John Cage and 
Arthur Dove. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in a world where so much is about the transmission of electronic 
information, it excludes lots of people. I like the idea that the stamp goes on 
the envelope and still gets from point A to B, where someone opens and reads 
it. It's very tangible. Stamps don't exclude anybody -- unless you count who 
decides what image goes on the stamp. That process excludes lots of people 
because it's always the people in power." As an example, she picks up a 
three-cent stamp of 1953 bearing the slogan "Atoms for Peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Lightbody, who is 40 years old, lives up to her fabulous name -- a taut 
combination of ethereal intelligence and earthy pragmatism. Her father was the 
liberal-minded pastor of a Protestant church. She grew up outside Philadelphia 
and when she was a junior in college moved to Southern California, in part 
because her family had moved here. She finished her degree at the College of 
Creative Studies at UC Santa Barbara in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being raised in a household where I listened to a lot of choral music 
definitely had an influence" on the work, she says. Yet, the texts for her 
musical compositions are drawn from distinctly secular sources, such as 
newspapers or from writers like Bernard Cooper. Her focus is on the sound of 
the texts, the structure of words and their phonemes. Strict systems organized 
her early music as well as her visual art. 
</P>
<P>
 She is less rigid today, she says, in part because of her keen interest in the 
methodology of world music. As an example, she cites the structure of the raga 
in Indian classical music. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's set up like the cartographic projections on my collages, in that there 
are built-in spaces for improvisation, where (they put) the ideas that have to 
do with sentiment." 
</P>
<P>
 For Lightbody, language, geography and music are interwoven disciplines. She 
says, "The same idea is behind being interested in (all of it) -- the plotting 
of land masses, city states, bodies of water. It's plotting out the unknown, 
familiarizing yourself, whether by physical cartography or spiritual 
cartography. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the idea of dichotomy," she continues. "In these pieces, as I go 
through the last stage of pressing on the stamps, I notice what emerges and 
what submerges. It's a geographic issue in terms of islands, but it plays with 
the idea of what is said and what is left unsaid."

GREG & STEVE: EDUCATIONAL PIED PIPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What do a couple of "fortysomething-and-then-some" ex-Newport Beach surfers 
from the '60s have in common with the multimillion-selling, "Baby 
Beluga"-singing, children's music phenom Raffi? 
</P>
<P>
 Record sales. You may not have heard of Greg Scelsa and Steve Millang -- heck, 
even many parents with children don't know who they are -- but the duo known 
simply as Greg & Steve have played Carnegie Hall, they can sell out 15,000-seat 
venues and their fans -- special education and early childhood educators, plus 
the clued-in parents of young children -- have bought over two million copies 
of their 10 albums. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of financial success, that puts the laid-back, Los Angeles-based 
kids' rock 'n' rollers near the top of the Raffi-led children's music field. 
</P>
<P>
 They tour the United States and Canada more than 100 days a year; locally, 
they can be seen in concert today through Thursday at El Camino College in 
Torrance and on May 20 at Citrus College in Glendora. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for the pair's quiet success? From the 1975 release of "We All Live 
Together," their first album on their independent Youngheart Records label, 
Greg & Steve have almost exclusively targeted the educational market. Their 
polished, movement-oriented songs, humor and strong rock and bluesy vocals have 
won praise and broad national support among teachers and children in public and 
private preschools, Headstart programs and early primary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Education is still their primary market, but in recent years, with additional 
resources from Young-heart's merger in 1990 with Creative Teaching Press, Greg 
& Steve albums and videos have begun slipping into the mainstream children's 
music market. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't changed what we do particularly," said Scelsa, from a Chinese 
restaurant in Detroit -- he and Millang traded the phone back and forth, while 
grabbing a post-concert bite before heading up to Pennsylvania for another gig. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the rest of the industry is catching up with us. They're learning 
that children's music isn't necessarily just entertainment. It has to be more 
than that. Because of our educational roots, we are extremely aware that each 
song we do has an educational skew to it, from motor skills to social awareness 
to language development." 
</P>
<P>
 Those educational roots go back to 1968, when Scelsa and Millang, after 
playing in rock bands through high school, moved to Los Angeles "to get closer 
to the music business," Millang said. To pay the rent, they found jobs in 
special education classes as teacher assistants where "they would ask us to 
bring our guitars in and we would stop cleaning paintbrushes and start singing 
to the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 For six years, until the release of their first album, the pair "unofficially" 
became music teachers, "traveling from school to school doing music programs."  
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly beat playing Holiday Inn bar gigs," Scelsa said. "We found a 
real sense of purpose. We're still blown away that people show up for our 
concerts." 
</P>
<P>
 Underscoring the respect they've earned, Millang and Scelsa, each married with 
three kids, are in demand for their annual state and national workshops for 
educators. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw them first perform 18 years ago," said Heidi Thumlert, an early 
education specialist and member of the National Association for the Education 
of Young Children. She was impressed with Greg & Steve's '60s rock 'n' roll 
style, notably different at a time when "most performers came out of the '50s 
folk tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had this wonderful fresh approach to engaging children . . . the way 
they were able to involve children physically in the music" set them apart from 
other artists. "Now, there are a lot of artists who do that kind of stuff, but 
Greg & Steve were pioneers." 
</P>
<P>
 Scelsa and Millang don't fit the usual funky or folky personas typical of 
other children's performers. Good-looking in a casual, well-groomed, pressed 
khakis-and-pullover way, they have the polished look of a couple of successful 
weekending execs -- and indeed, they both are involved in the adult side of the 
record business. 
</P>
<P>
 Millang is a producer who owns the Silverlake Sound Studio, serving such 
clients as MCA and Warner Bros. Records; Scelsa, who writes most of the duo's 
predominantly mid-'60s-style rock 'n' roll children's material, has written and 
co-written hit songs for such Motown R&B groups as The Boys and Klymaxx. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, even after 18 years on the road, both say that nothing compares to 
performing for children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel we have the best seat in the house," Scelsa said, "because we get to 
see the faces of the children and teachers and parents. As long as people keep 
wanting us, we're going to keep going." 
</P>
